'''''A Song of Ice and Fire''''' is a series of [[High fantasy|epic fantasy]] novels by the American novelist and screenwriter [[George R. R. Martin]]. He began the first volume of the series, ''[[A Game of Thrones]],'' in 1991, and it was published in 1996. Martin, who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy, has published five out of a planned seven volumes. The fifth and most recent volume of the series published in 2011, ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', took Martin six years to write. He is currently writing the sixth novel, ''[[The Winds of Winter]]''.

''A Song of Ice and Fire'' takes place on the fictional continents [[Westeros]] and [[Essos]]. The [[Point of view (literature)#Narrative point of view|point of view]] of each chapter in the story is a [[Point of view (literature)#Third-person, subjective|limited]] perspective of a range of characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to 31 characters by the fifth novel. Three main stories interweave: a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural [[Others (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Others]] in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition of [[Daenerys Targaryen]], the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Iron Throne]].

Martin's inspirations included the [[Wars of the Roses]] and the French [[Historical fiction|historical novels]] ''[[The Accursed Kings]]'' by [[Maurice Druon]].&lt;ref name="bbc french"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewish legacy"/&gt; ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion, as well as its realism. An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader, and the success or survival of point of view characters is never assured. Within the often morally ambiguous world of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and the morality of [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire#Violence and death|violence]] frequently arise.

{{as of|2016|August|}}, the books have sold more than 70&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alison Flood|title=Game of Thrones: an epic publishing story|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/05/game-of-thrones-an-epic-publishing-story-george-rr-martin|website=The Guardian|accessdate=10 April 2018|date=5 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, {{as of|2017|January|lc=y}}, have been translated into 47 languages.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/10/george-rr-martin-revolutionised-how-people-think-about-fantasy |title='George RR Martin revolutionised how people think about fantasy' &amp;#124; Books &amp;#124; The Guardian |publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/516673.html|title=Another Precinct Heard From|last=grrm|date=2017-01-16|website=Not A Blog|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth and fifth volumes reached the top of [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller lists]] upon their releases.&lt;ref name=nytimes_vile_hobbits/&gt; Among the [[Works based on A Song of Ice and Fire|many derived works]] are [[#Novellas|several prequel novellas]], [[Game of Thrones|a TV series]], a [[A Game of Thrones (comics)|comic book adaptation]], and several [[A Game of Thrones (card game)|card]], [[A Game of Thrones (board game)|board]], and [[List of A Song of Ice and Fire video games|video games]].

==Plot synopsis==
{{further|List of A Song of Ice and Fire characters|World of A Song of Ice and Fire}}

''A Song of Ice and Fire'' takes place in a fictional world in which seasons last for years and end unpredictably. Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel, the Seven Kingdoms of [[Westeros]] were united under the [[Targaryen]] dynasty by Aegon I and his sister wives Visenya and Rhaenys, establishing military supremacy through their control of dragons. Aegon became the first king of the entire continent of Westeros, save for the southerly region of Dorne. The Targaryen dynasty ruled for three hundred years, although civil war and infighting between the Targaryens resulted in the death of all their dragons. At the beginning of ''A Game of Thrones'', 15 peaceful years have passed since the rebellion led by Lord [[Robert Baratheon]] that deposed and killed the last Targaryen king, Aerys II "the Mad King", and proclaimed Robert king of the Seven Kingdoms, with a nine-year-long summer coming to an end.

The principal story chronicles the power struggle for the Iron Throne among the great Houses of Westeros following the death of King Robert in ''A Game of Thrones''. Robert's heir apparent, the 13-year-old [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], is immediately proclaimed king through the machinations of his mother, Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]. When Lord [[Eddard Stark|Eddard "Ned" Stark]], Robert's closest friend and chief advisor, discovers that Joffrey and his siblings are the product of incest between Cersei and her twin brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime "The Kingslayer" Lannister]], Eddard attempts to unseat Joffrey, but is betrayed and executed for treason. In response, Robert's brothers [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] both lay separate claims to the throne. During this period of instability, two of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros attempt to become independent from the Iron Throne: Eddard's eldest son [[Robb Stark|Robb]] is proclaimed King in the North, while Lord [[Balon Greyjoy]] desires to recover the sovereignty of his region, the Iron Islands. The so-called "War of the Five Kings" is in full progress by the middle of the second book, ''[[A Clash of Kings]]''.

The second part of story takes place in the far north of Westeros, where an 8,000-year-old wall of ice, simply called "[[The Wall (A Song of Ice and Fire)|the Wall]]", defends the Seven Kingdoms from supernatural creatures known as [[White Walker|the Others]]. The Wall's sentinels, the Sworn Brotherhood of the [[Night's Watch]], also protect the realm from the incursions of the "[[wildlings]]" or "Free Folk", who are several human tribes living on the north side of the Wall. The Night's Watch story is told primarily through the point of view of [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], Lord Eddard Stark's [[illegitimacy|bastard son]].&lt;ref name="Forbes1"/&gt; Jon follows the footsteps of his uncle [[Benjen Stark]] and joins the Watch at a young age, rising quickly through the ranks.  He eventually becomes Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. In the third volume, ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'', the Night's Watch storyline becomes increasingly entangled with the War of the Five Kings.

The third storyline follows [[Daenerys Targaryen]], daughter of Aerys II, the last Targaryen king. On the continent of Essos, east of Westeros [[across the Narrow Sea]], Daenerys is married off by her elder brother [[Viserys Targaryen]] to a powerful warlord, but slowly becomes an independent and intelligent ruler in her own right. Her rise to power is aided by the historic birth of three [[European dragon|dragons]], hatched from eggs given to her as wedding gifts. The three dragons soon become not only a symbol of her bloodline and her legitimate claim to the throne, but also devastating weapons of war, which help her in conquest of the Slaver's bay.

===First three novels (1991–2000) {{Anchor|First three novels}}===
[[File:George R.R. Martin at Archipelacon.jpg|thumb|[[George R. R. Martin]] at Archipelacon in [[Mariehamn]], 2015.]]
George R. R. Martin was already a successful fantasy and sci-fi author and TV writer before writing his ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' book series.&lt;ref name=ew_fantasy_king/&gt; Martin had published his first short story in 1971 and his first novel in 1977.&lt;ref name=indigo_iv2/&gt; By the mid-1990s, he had won three [[Hugo Awards]], two [[Nebula Awards]], and other awards for his short fiction.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine/&gt; Although his early books were well-received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine/&gt; He worked principally on the [[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|revival of ''The Twilight Zone'']] throughout 1986 and on ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine/&gt; and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes.&lt;ref name=nytimes_twisted/&gt; This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine/&gt; Admiring the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_ew/&gt;

When Martin was between Hollywood projects in the summer of 1991, he started writing a new science fiction novel called ''Avalon''. After three chapters, he had a vivid idea of a boy seeing a man's beheading and finding direwolves in the snow, which would eventually become the first non-prologue chapter of ''A Game of Thrones''.&lt;ref name=rollingstone_grrmiv/&gt; Putting ''Avalon'' aside, Martin finished this chapter in a few days and grew certain that it was part of a longer story.&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_weirdtm/&gt; After a few more chapters, Martin perceived his new book as a fantasy story&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_weirdtm/&gt; and started making maps and genealogies.&lt;ref name=ew_fantasy_king/&gt; However, the writing of this book was interrupted for a few years when Martin returned to Hollywood to produce his TV series ''[[Doorways]]'' that [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] had ordered but ultimately never aired.&lt;ref name=nytimes_twisted/&gt;

{{Quote box | quote="The first scene...chapter one of the first book, the chapter where they find the direwolf pups...just came to me out of nowhere. I was...at work on a different novel, and suddenly I saw that scene. It didn't belong in the novel I was writing, but it came to me so vividly that I had to sit down and write it, and by the time I did, it led to a second chapter, and the second chapter was the Catelyn chapter where Ned has just come back."| source =—George R. R. Martin in 2014&lt;ref name=vanityfair_catchup/&gt; | width =250px | align =right}}

In 1994, Martin gave his agent, [[Kirby McCauley]], the first 200 pages and a two-page story projection as part of a planned trilogy with the novels ''A Dance with Dragons'' and ''The Winds of Winter'' intended to follow. When Martin had still not reached the novel's end at 1400 manuscript pages, he felt that the series needed to be four and eventually six books long,&lt;ref name=nytimes_twisted/&gt;&lt;ref name=tiff1/&gt; which he imagined as two linked trilogies of one long story.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_infinityplus/&gt; Martin chose ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' as the overall series title: Martin saw the struggle of the cold Others and the fiery dragons as one possible meaning for "Ice and Fire", whereas the word "song" had previously appeared in Martin's book titles ''[[A Song for Lya]]'' and ''Songs the Dead Men Sing'', stemming from his obsessions with songs.&lt;ref name=fantasyonline/&gt; Martin also named [[Robert Frost]]'s 1920 poem "[[Fire and Ice (poem)|Fire and Ice]]" and cultural associations such as passion versus betrayal as possible influences for the series' title.&lt;ref name=adria_trying/&gt;

The revised finished manuscript for ''A Game of Thrones'' was 1088 pages long (without the appendices),&lt;ref name="Done 2005"/&gt; with the publication following in August 1996.&lt;ref name=pw_review_agot/&gt; ''Wheel of Time'' author [[Robert Jordan]] had written a short endorsement for the cover that was influential in ensuring the book's and hence series' early success with fantasy readers.&lt;ref name=ew_by_george/&gt; ''Blood of the Dragon'', a pre-release sample novella drawn from Daenerys's chapters, went on to win the 1997 Hugo Award for Best Novella.&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt;

The 300 pages removed from the ''A Game of Thrones'' manuscript served as the opening of the second book, entitled ''[[A Clash of Kings]]''.&lt;ref name=tiff1/&gt; It was released in February 1999 in the United States,&lt;ref name=pw_review_acok/&gt; with a manuscript length (without appendices) of 1184 pages.&lt;ref name="Done 2005"/&gt; ''A Clash of Kings'' was the first book of the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series to make the best-seller lists,&lt;ref name=nytimes_twisted/&gt; reaching 13 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=nytimes_bs990221/&gt; After the success of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' films, Martin received his first inquiries to the rights of the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series from various producers and filmmakers.&lt;ref name=nytimes_twisted/&gt;

Martin was several months late turning in the third book, ''[[A Storm of Swords]]''.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine/&gt; The last chapter he had written was about the "Red Wedding", a pivotal scene notable for its violence (see [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire#Violence and death|Themes: Violence and death]]).&lt;ref name=indigo_iv1/&gt; ''A Storm of Swords'' was 1521 pages in manuscript (without appendices),&lt;ref name="Done 2005"/&gt; causing problems for many of Martin's publishers around the world. [[Bantam Books]] published ''A Storm of Swords'' in a single volume in the United States in November 2000,&lt;ref name=pw_review_asos/&gt; whereas some other-language editions were divided into two, three, or even four volumes.&lt;ref name="Done 2005"/&gt; ''A Storm of Swords'' debuted at number 12 in the ''New York Times'' bestseller list.&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes_bs001119/&gt;

===Bridging the timeline gap (2000–2011) {{Anchor|Bridging the timeline gap}}===
After ''A Game of Thrones'', ''A Clash of Kings'', and ''A Storm of Swords'', Martin originally intended to write three more books.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine/&gt; The fourth&lt;!--yes, fourth--&gt; book, tentatively titled ''A Dance with Dragons'', was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_infinityplus/&gt; Martin wanted to set this story five years after ''A Storm of Swords'' so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_locusmag/&gt; Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than ''A Storm of Swords'', Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to ''A Clash of Kings''.&lt;ref name="Done 2005"/&gt; A long prologue was to establish what had happened in the meantime, initially just as one chapter of [[Aeron Damphair]] on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.&lt;ref name=gamepro/&gt;

In 2001, Martin was still optimistic that the fourth installment might be released in the last quarter of 2002.&lt;ref name=fantasyonline/&gt; However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_locusmag/&gt; After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called ''[[A Feast for Crows]]''.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_locusmag/&gt; The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap.&lt;ref name=fantasyonline/&gt; The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands.&lt;ref name=gamepro/&gt; These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.&lt;ref name=scifi_fowl/&gt;

The manuscript length of ''A Feast for Crows'' eventually surpassed ''A Storm of Swords''.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_locusmag/&gt; Martin was reluctant to make the necessary deep cuts to get the book down to publishable length, as that would have compromised the story he had in mind. Printing the book in "microtype on onion skin paper and giving each reader a magnifying glass" was also not an option for him.&lt;ref name="Done 2005"/&gt; On the other hand, Martin rejected the publishers' idea of splitting the narrative chronologically into ''A Feast for Crows'', Parts One and Two.&lt;ref name=nytimes_vile_hobbits/&gt; Being already late with the book, Martin had not even started writing all characters' stories&lt;ref name=guardian_gettingmore/&gt; and also objected to ending the first book without any resolution for its many viewpoint characters as in previous books.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_locusmag/&gt;

With the characters spread out across the world,&lt;ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy/&gt; a friend suggested that Martin divide the story geographically into two volumes, of which ''A Feast for Crows'' would be the first.&lt;ref name=nytimes_vile_hobbits/&gt; This approach would give Martin the room to complete his commenced story arcs as he had originally intended,&lt;ref name="Done 2005"/&gt; which he still felt was the best approach years later.&lt;ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy/&gt; Martin moved the unfinished characters' stories set in the east (Essos) and north (Winterfell and the Wall) into the next book, ''A Dance with Dragons'',&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb/&gt; and left ''A Feast for Crows'' to cover the events in King's Landing, the Riverlands, Dorne, and the Iron Islands.&lt;ref name="Done 2005"/&gt; Both books begin immediately after the end of ''A Storm of Swords'',&lt;ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy/&gt; running in parallel instead of sequentially, and involve different casts of characters with only little overlap.&lt;ref name="Done 2005"/&gt; Martin split Arya's chapters into both books after having already moved the three other most popular characters (Jon Snow, Tyrion, and Daenerys) into ''A Dance with Dragons''.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb/&gt;

Upon its release in October 2005 in the UK&lt;ref name=amazon_pubdate_AFFC/&gt; and November 2005 in the US,&lt;ref name=pw_review_affc/&gt; ''A Feast for Crows'' went straight to the top of ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestseller list.&lt;ref name=nytimes_bs051127/&gt; Among the positive reviewers was Lev Grossman of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', who dubbed Martin "the American Tolkien".&lt;ref name=time_american_tolkien/&gt; However, fans and critics alike were disappointed with the story split that left the fates of several popular characters unresolved after ''A Storm of Swords''{{'}} cliffhanger ending.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt;&lt;ref name=time_problem_power/&gt; With ''A Dance with Dragons'' said to be half-finished,&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; Martin mentioned in the epilogue of ''A Feast for Crows'' that the next volume would be released by the next year.&lt;ref name=globeandmail/&gt; However, planned release dates were repeatedly pushed back. Meanwhile, [[HBO]] acquired the rights to turn ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' into a dramatic series in 2007&lt;ref name="variety2007-01"/&gt; and aired the first of ten episodes covering ''A Game of Thrones'' in April 2011.&lt;ref name=variety_selling/&gt;

With around 1600 pages in manuscript length,&lt;ref name=guardian_barbarians/&gt; ''A Dance with Dragons'' was eventually published in July 2011 after six years of writing,&lt;ref name=nytimes_twisted/&gt; longer in page count and writing time than any of the preceding four novels.&lt;ref name=ew_fantasy_king/&gt;&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; The story of ''A Dance with Dragons'' catches up with and goes beyond ''A Feast for Crows'' around two-thirds into the book,&lt;ref name=guardian_gettingmore/&gt; but nevertheless covers less story than Martin had intended, omitting at least one planned large battle sequence and leaving several character threads ending in cliff-hangers.&lt;ref name=ew_fantasy_king/&gt; Martin attributed the delay mainly to his untangling "the [[Meereen]]ese knot", which the interviewer understood as "making the chronology and characters mesh up as various threads converged on [Daenerys]".&lt;ref name=time_problem_power/&gt; Martin also acknowledged spending too much time on rewriting and perfecting the story, but soundly rejected the theories of some of his critics that he had lost interest in the series or would bide his time to make more money.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt;

===Planned novels and future===
Martin believes the last two volumes of the series will be big books of 1500 manuscript pages each.&lt;ref name=empire_webchat/&gt; The sixth book will be called ''[[The Winds of Winter]]'',&lt;ref name=dancingincircles/&gt; taking the title of the last book of the originally planned trilogy.&lt;ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy/&gt; Displeased with the provisional title ''A Time for Wolves'' for the final volume, Martin ultimately announced ''A Dream of Spring'' as the title for the seventh book in 2006.&lt;ref name=grrm_blog_060326/&gt; Martin said in March 2012 that the final two novels will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and that the Others will appear in the book.&lt;ref name=smartertravel/&gt;

====''The Winds of Winter'' ====
{{further|The Winds of Winter}}
''[[The Winds of Winter]]'' will resolve the cliffhangers from ''A Dance with Dragons'' early on and "will open with the two big battles that [the fifth book] was building up to, the battle in the ice and the battle [...] of Slaver's Bay. And then take it from there."&lt;ref name=smartertravel/&gt; By the middle of 2010, Martin had already finished five chapters of ''The Winds of Winter'' from the viewpoints of [[Sansa Stark]], [[Arya Stark]], [[Arianne Martell]], and [[Aeron Greyjoy]], coming to around 100 completed pages.&lt;ref name=dancingincircles/&gt;&lt;ref name=grrm_blog_200721/&gt; After the publication of ''A Dance with Dragons'' in 2011, Martin announced he would return to writing in January 2012.&lt;ref name=ew_fantasy_king/&gt; He spent the meantime on book tours, conventions, and continued working on his ''[[The World of Ice &amp; Fire]]'' companion guide and a new ''[[Tales of Dunk and Egg]]'' novella.&lt;ref name=wsj_spill/&gt;&lt;ref name=nymag_butterfly/&gt;

In December 2011, Martin posted a chapter from ''The Winds of Winter'' from the viewpoint of [[Theon Greyjoy]];&lt;ref name=nydailynews_sample_chapter/&gt; several other chapters have been made public since. Four hundred pages of the sixth novel had been written {{as of|2012|October|lc=y}}, although Martin considered only 200 as "really finished"; the rest needed revising.&lt;ref name=adria_trying/&gt; In 2011, Martin gave three years as a realistic estimate for finishing the sixth book at a good pace,&lt;ref name=guardian_barbarians/&gt; but said ultimately the book "will be done when it's done",&lt;ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy/&gt; acknowledging that his publication estimates had been too optimistic in the past.&lt;ref name=ew_fantasy_king/&gt; Martin did not intend to separate the characters geographically again.&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_ew/&gt;

In 2015 there were indications that the book would be published before the [[Game of Thrones (season 6)|sixth season]] of the HBO show&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/03/george-rr-martin-winds-date|title='Game of Thrones' author George R.R.

He also revealed there had been a previous deadline of October 2015 that he had considered achievable in May 2015, and that in September 2015 he had still considered the end-of-year deadline achievable.

During the Guadalajara International Book Fair in Mexico in early December 2016, Martin offered the following hint as to the tone of this book:&lt;blockquote&gt;There are a lot of dark chapters right now ... I've been telling you for 20 years that winter was coming. Winter is the time when things die, and cold and ice and darkness fill the world, so this is not going to be the happy feel-good that people may be hoping for. Some of the characters [are] in very dark places.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/article/2016/12/06/george-rr-martin-teases-winds-of-winter/ |title=George RR Martin on Winds of Winter: Things are getting worse |last=Gettell |first=Oliver |date=December 6, 2016 |website=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Time Inc. |access-date=December 21, 2016 |quote=Watch Martin’s full Q&amp;A above.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====''A Dream of Spring''====
Martin is firm about ending the series with the seventh novel "until I decide not to be firm".&lt;ref name=ew_fantasy_king/&gt; With his stated goal of telling the story from beginning to end, he will not truncate the story to fit into an arbitrary number of volumes.&lt;ref name=indigo_iv1/&gt; He knows the ending in broad strokes as well as the future of the main characters,&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_ew/&gt; and will finish the series with bittersweet elements where not everyone will live happily ever after.&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt; Martin hopes to write an ending similar to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' that he felt gave the story a satisfying depth and resonance. On the other hand, Martin noted the challenge to avoid a situation like [[The End (Lost)|the finale of the TV series ''Lost'']], which left some fans disappointed by deviating too far from their own theories and desires.&lt;ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy/&gt; In 2015, Martin said that he was not writing ''A Dream of Spring'' together with ''The Winds of Winter'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/440213.html?thread=22477973#t22477973|title=Back From Bubonicon|first=|last=grrm|date=August 31, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in early 2016, he said he did not believe ''A Dream of Spring'' would be published before the last season of the HBO show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnrdaily.com/article/george-r-r-martin-says-there-will-be-winds-of-winter-spoilers-in-game-of-thrones-season-six/9239.htm|title=George R.R.

Martin offered the following hint as to how the series would conclude during a Q&amp;A at the [[Guadalajara International Book Fair]]. "I'm not going to tell you how I'm going to end my book, but I suspect the overall flavor is going to be as much bittersweet as it is happy."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

====TV series and other writings====
Early during the development of the TV series, Martin told major plot points to producers [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]].&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_ew/&gt; (''The New York Times'' reported in 2011 that, at age 62, Martin was by all accounts in robust health.)&lt;ref name=nytimes_sells_well/&gt; Martin was confident he would have published at least ''The Winds of Winter'' before the TV series overtook him.&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_ew/&gt; Nevertheless, there was general concern about whether Martin would be able to stay ahead of the show.&lt;ref name=grrm_ticking_clock/&gt; As a result, head writers Benioff and Weiss learned more future plot points from Martin in 2013 to help them set up the show's new possible seasons. This included the end stories for all the core characters. Deviations from the books' storylines are also being considered, but a two-year show hiatus to wait for new books is not an option for them as the child actors continue to grow and the show's popularity would wane.&lt;ref name=hitfix/&gt; Martin indicated he would not permit another writer to finish the book series.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; On January 2, 2016, Martin confirmed that the sixth volume would not be published before the start of the sixth season of the HBO series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/the-dartboard/game-of-thrones-season-6-will-be-out-before-george-rr-martins-next-book|title=‘Game of Thrones’ season 6 will be out before George R.R. Martin’s next book|date=January 2, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' as his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], Martin is certain never to write anything on this scale again and would only return to this fictional universe in the context of stand-alone novels.&lt;ref name=gamepro/&gt; He prefers to write stories about characters from other ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' periods of history such as his ''[[Tales of Dunk and Egg]]'' project, instead of continuing the series directly.&lt;ref name=gamepro/&gt;&lt;ref name=pw_talking/&gt; A possible future side project is a prequel set during Aegon's conquest of Westeros.&lt;ref name=grrm_aegon_prequel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/comic-con-george-rr-martin-game-thrones-prequel.html|title=Comic-Con: George R. R. Martin Talks Game of Thrones Prequel Possibilities|date=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin said he would love to return to writing short stories, novellas, novelettes, and stand-alone novels from diverse genres such as science fiction, horror, fantasy, or even a murder mystery. However, he will see if his audience follows him after publishing his next project.&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_weirdtm/&gt;&lt;ref name=ew_by_george/&gt;

==Inspiration and writing==

===Genre===
{{further|Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire}}
George R. R. Martin believes the most profound influences to be the ones experienced in childhood.&lt;ref name=deepmagic41/&gt; Having read [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Eric Frank Russell]], [[Andre Norton]],&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_weirdtm/&gt; [[Isaac Asimov]],&lt;ref name=fantasyonline/&gt; [[Fritz Leiber]], and [[Mervyn Peake]]&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_sfsite2/&gt; in his youth, Martin never categorized these authors' literature into science fiction, fantasy, or horror and will write from any genre as a result.&lt;ref name=deepmagic41/&gt; Martin classified ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' as "[[epic fantasy]]",&lt;ref name=guardian_barbarians/&gt; and specifically named [[Tad Williams]]' high fantasy epic ''[[Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn]]'' as very influential for the writing of the series.&lt;ref name=fantasyonline/&gt;&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_sfsite2/&gt; One of his favorite authors is [[Jack Vance]],&lt;ref name=fantasyonline/&gt; although Martin considered the series not particularly Vancean.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_infinityplus/&gt;

Martin experienced some harsh winters when living in [[Dubuque]] a few years in the 70s, and suspects these winters had an influence on his writing; "I think a lot of the stuff in A Game of Thrones, the snow and ice and freezing, comes from my memories of Dubuque".&lt;ref name=vanityfair_catchup/&gt;

{{Quote box | quote="[Martin's ''Ice and Fire'' series] was groundbreaking (at least for me) in all kinds of ways. Above all, the books were extremely unpredictable, especially in a genre where readers have come to expect the intensely predictable. [...] ''A Game of Thrones'' was profoundly shocking when I first read it, and fundamentally changed my notions about what could be done with epic fantasy." | source =—Fantasy writer [[Joe Abercrombie]] in 2008&lt;ref name=joeabercrombie/&gt; | width =250px | align =right}}

The medieval setting has been the traditional background for epic fantasy. However, where historical fiction leaves versed readers knowing the historical outcome,&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_sfsite2/&gt; original characters may increase suspense and empathy for the readers.&lt;ref name=deepmagic41/&gt; Yet Martin felt historical fiction, particularly when set during the Middle Ages, had an excitement, grittiness, and a realness to it that was absent in fantasy with a similar backdrop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://njmonthly.com/articles/lifestyle/NJM-Q-and-A/qa-with-george-rr-martin.html Q&amp;A With George R.R. Martin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619182600/http://njmonthly.com/articles/lifestyle/NJM-Q-and-A/qa-with-george-rr-martin.html |date=June 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he wanted to combine the realism of historical fiction with the magic appeal of the best fantasies,&lt;ref name=time_grrm_ivp2/&gt; subduing magic in favor of battles and political intrigue.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine/&gt; He also decided to avoid the conventional good versus evil setting typical for the genre, using the fight between Achilles and Hector in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', where no one stands out as either a hero or a villain, as an example of what he wants to achieve with his books.&lt;ref name="adriasnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adriasnews.com/2012/10/george-r-r-martin-interview.html |title=Adria's News: George R.R. Martin: "Trying to please everyone is a horrible mistake" |publisher=adriasnews.com|accessdate=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin is widely credited with broadening the fantasy fiction genre for adult content, including incest, paedophilia, and adultery.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; For ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'s}} Writing for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', Amber Taylor assessed the novels as [[hard fantasy]] with vulnerable characters to which readers become emotionally attached.&lt;ref name=atlantic_brutal/&gt; [[CNN]] found in 2000 that Martin's mature descriptions were "far more frank than those found in the works of other fantasy authors",&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; although Martin assessed the fantasy genre to have become rougher-edged a decade later and that some writers' work was going beyond the mature themes of his novels.&lt;ref name=indigo_iv1/&gt; [[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Adam Roberts]] called Martin's series the most successful and popular example of the emerging subgenre of [[grimdark]] fantasy.&lt;ref name="Roberts 2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Adam|title=Get Started in: Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy|date=2014|publisher=Hachette UK|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2rEAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT42|isbn=9781444795660|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing process===
Setting out to write something on an epic scale,&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages in the very early stages of the series.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_sfsite2/&gt; His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_locusmag/&gt; In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later.&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt; However, with ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing,&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb/&gt; he still has two more books to write {{as of|2018|lc=y}}. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] to immerse himself in the fictional world and write.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine/&gt; {{as of|2011}}, Martin was still typing his fiction on a [[DOS]] computer with [[WordStar|WordStar 4.0 software]].&lt;ref name=grrm_blog_110217/&gt; He begins each day at 10&amp;nbsp;am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work,&lt;ref name=deepmagic41/&gt; and may write all day or struggle to write anything.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine/&gt; Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb/&gt; Martin does not consider ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' a "series" but a single story published in several volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://grrm.livejournal.com/562606.html|title=Hugo Nominations Open|first=|last=grrm|date=February 7, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard Burchett - Sanctuary (1867) contrasted.jpg|thumb|''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series was partly inspired by the [[Wars of the Roses]], a series of dynastic civil wars for the throne of England. This painting by [[Richard Burchett]] portrays [[Edward IV]] demanding that his defeated enemies be taken from [[Tewkesbury Abbey]].]]

Martin set the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' story in a [[secondary world]] inspired by Tolkien's writing.&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_ew/&gt; Unlike Tolkien, who created entire languages, mythologies, and histories for Middle-earth long before writing ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Martin usually starts with a rough sketch of an imaginary world that he improvises into a workable fictional setting along the way.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; He described his writing as coming from a subconscious level in "almost a daydreaming process",&lt;ref name=dragonsworn/&gt; and his stories, which have a mythic rather than a scientific core, draw from emotion instead of rationality.&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_weirdtm/&gt; Martin employs maps&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine/&gt; and a cast list topping 60 pages in the fourth volume,&lt;ref name=nytimes_vile_hobbits/&gt; but keeps most information in his mind.&lt;ref name=guardian_barbarians/&gt; His imagined backstory remains subject to change until published, and only the novels count as [[canon (fiction)|canon]].&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb/&gt; Martin does not intend to publish his private notes after the series is finished.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine/&gt;

Martin drew much inspiration from actual history for the series,&lt;ref name=deepmagic41/&gt; having several bookcases filled with medieval history for research&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_sffworld/&gt; and visiting historic European landmarks.&lt;ref name=scifi_fowl/&gt; For an American who speaks only English, the history of England proved the easiest source of medieval history for him, giving the series a British rather than a German or Spanish historic flavor.&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_polish/&gt; For example, Ned and Robb Stark resemble [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York]], and his son [[Edward IV]], and Queen Cersei resembles both [[Margaret of Anjou]]&lt;ref name="west20140329"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/arts/television/9168401/game-of-thrones-tells-the-story-of-britain-better-than-most-non-fiction/ | title=Game of Thrones tells the story of Britain better than most histories | work=The Spectator | date=March 29, 2014 | accessdate=March 27, 2014| author=West, Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elizabeth Woodville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Adair | first=Jamie | title=Cersei Lannister: the evil queen we love to hate | url=http://history-behind-game-of-thrones.com/warofroses/cersei | website=historygot.com | date=May 5, 2013 | accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin immersed himself in many diverse medieval topics such as clothing, food, feasting, and tournaments to have the facts at hand if needed during writing.&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt; The series was in particular influenced by the [[Hundred Years' War]], the [[Crusades]], the [[Albigensian Crusade]], and the [[Wars of the Roses]],&lt;ref name=deepmagic41/&gt;&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_sffworld/&gt; although Martin refrained from making any direct adaptations.&lt;ref name=deepmagic41/&gt; Martin was also inspired by the French historical novels ''[[The Accursed Kings]]'' by [[Maurice Druon]], which are about the [[French monarchy]] in the 13th and 14th centuries.&lt;ref name="bbc french"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewish legacy"/&gt;

The story is written to follow principal landmarks with an ultimate destination, but leaves Martin room for improvisation. On occasion, improvised details significantly affected the planned story.&lt;ref name=time_grrm_ivp3/&gt; By the fourth book, Martin kept more private notes than ever before to keep track of the many subplots,&lt;ref name=fantasyonline/&gt; which became so detailed and sprawling by the fifth book as to be unwieldy.&lt;ref name=ew_fantasy_king/&gt; Martin's editors, copy editors, and readers monitor for accidental mistakes,&lt;ref name=fantasyonline/&gt; although some errors have slipped into publication. For instance, Martin has inconsistently referred to certain characters' eye colors, and has described a horse as being of one sex and then another.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt;

The books are divided into chapters, each one narrated in the [[Third-person limited narrative|third person limited]] through the eyes of a [[point of view (literature)|point of view]] character,&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; an approach Martin learned himself as a young journalism student.&lt;ref name=indiewire_10things/&gt; Beginning with nine POV characters in ''A Game of Thrones'', the number of POV characters grows to a total of 31 in ''A Dance with Dragons'' (see table). The short-lived one-time POV characters are mostly restricted to the [[prologue]] and [[epilogue]].&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt; David Orr of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted the story importance of "the [[House Stark|Starks]] (good guys), the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] (at least one good guy, or girl), the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] (conniving), the [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoys]] (mostly conniving), the [[House Baratheon|Baratheons]] (mixed bag), the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] (unclear) and the [[House Martell|Martells]] (ditto), most of whom are feverishly endeavoring to advance their ambitions and ruin their enemies, preferably unto death".&lt;ref name=nytimes_rise_fantasy/&gt; However, as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'s}} [[Lev Grossman]] noted, readers "experience the struggle for Westeros from all sides at once", such that "every fight is both triumph and tragedy [...] and everybody is both hero and villain at the same time".&lt;ref name=time_masterpiece_tolkien/&gt;

Modeled on ''The Lord of the Rings'', the story of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' begins with a tight focus on a small group (with everyone in [[Winterfell]], except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding the turning point in this complex series has been difficult for Martin and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin is said to have reached the turning point in ''A Dance with Dragons'',&lt;ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy/&gt; or to not quite have reached it yet in the books.&lt;ref name=io9_gods/&gt; The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by ''[[Wild Cards]]'', a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_boomtron/&gt; As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt;

Influenced by his television and film scripting background, Martin tries to keep readers engrossed by ending each ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' chapter with a tense or revelational moment, a twist or a [[cliffhanger]], similar to a TV [[Act structure|act break]].&lt;ref name=time_grrm_ivp1/&gt; Scriptwriting has also taught him the technique of "cutting out the fat and leaving the muscle", which is the final stage of completing a book, a technique that brought the page count in ''A Dance with Dragons'' down almost eighty pages.&lt;ref name=grrm_blog_110519/&gt; Dividing the continuous ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' story into books is much harder for Martin. Each book shall represent a phase of the journey that ends in closure for most characters. A smaller portion of characters is left with clear-cut cliffhangers to make sure readers come back for the next installment, although ''A Dance with Dragons'' had more cliffhangers than Martin originally intended.&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_ew/&gt;&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt; Both one-time and regular POV characters are designed to have full character arcs ending in tragedy or triumph,&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt; and are written to hold the readers' interest and not be skipped in reading.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_sfsite2/&gt; Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not rely on the hero to come through unscathed and will instead feel the character's fear with each page turn.&lt;ref name=ew_by_george/&gt;

The unresolved larger narrative arc encourages speculation about future story events.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; According to Martin, much of the key to ''A Song of Ice and Fire''{{'s}} future lies over a dozen&lt;!--the source's "sixteen" refers only to ASOS--&gt; years in the fictional past, of which each volume reveals more.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine/&gt; Events planned from the beginning are foreshadowed, although Martin is careful not to make the story predictable.&lt;ref name=io9_gods/&gt; The viewpoint characters, who serve as [[unreliable narrator]]s,&lt;ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy/&gt; may clarify or provide different perspectives on past events.&lt;ref name=atlantic_true_blood/&gt; Therefore, what the readers believe to be true may not necessarily be true.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine/&gt;

===Character development===
{{main|List of A Song of Ice and Fire characters}}
Regarding the characters as the heart of the story,&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_scotcampus /&gt; Martin planned the epic ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' to have a large cast of characters and many different settings from the beginning.&lt;ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy /&gt; ''A Feast for Crows'' has a 63-page list of characters,&lt;ref name=nytimes_vile_hobbits /&gt; with many of the thousands of characters mentioned only in passing&lt;ref name=newyorker /&gt; or disappearing from view for long stretches.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost_worth_wait /&gt; When Martin adds a new family to the ever-growing number of [[genealogy|genealogies]] in the appendices, he devises a secret about the personality or fate of the family members. However, their backstory remains subject to change until written down in the story.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb /&gt; Martin drew most character inspiration from history (without directly translating historical figures)&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine /&gt; and his own experiences, but also from the manners of his friends, acquaintances, and people of public interest.&lt;ref name=fantasyonline /&gt; Martin aims to "make my characters real and to make them human, characters who have good and bad, noble and selfish well-mixed in their natures".&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale /&gt; Jeff VanderMeer of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' remarked that "Martin's devotion to fully inhabiting his characters, for better or worse, creates the unstoppable momentum in his novels and contains an implied criticism of Tolkien's moral simplicity"&lt;ref name=latimes_adwdreview /&gt; (see [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire#Moral ambiguity|Themes: Moral ambiguity]]).

Martin deliberately ignored the writing rule of never giving two characters names starting with the same letter.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb/&gt; Instead, character names reflect the naming systems in various European family histories, where particular names were associated with specific [[dynasty|royal houses]] and where even the secondary families assigned the same names repeatedly.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb/&gt; The story of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' therefore has children called "Robert" in honor of King Robert of House Baratheon, a "Brandon" in every other generation of the Starks in commemoration of Brandon the Builder (of the Wall), and the syllable "Ty" commonly occurring in given names of House Lannister.&lt;ref name=tiff1/&gt; Confident that readers would pay attention, Martin distinguished people sharing a [[given name]]&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb/&gt; by adding numbers or locations to their given names (e.g. [[Henry V of England]]). The family names were designed in association with ethnic groups (see [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Background|backstory]]): the First Men in the North of Westeros had very simply descriptive names like Stark and Strong, whereas the descendants of the Andal invaders in the South have more elaborate, undescriptive house names like Lannister or Arryn, and the Targaryens and Valyrians from the Eastern continent have the most exotic names with the letter Y.&lt;ref name=tiff1/&gt;

All characters are designed to speak with their own internal voices to capture their views of the world.&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt; ''The Atlantic'' pondered whether Martin ultimately intended the readers to sympathize with characters on both sides of the Lannister–Stark feud long before plot developments force them to make their emotional choices.&lt;ref name=atlantic_reality/&gt; Contrary to most conventional epic fantasies, the characters of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' are vulnerable so that, according to ''The Atlantic'', the reader "cannot be sure that good shall triumph, which makes those instances where it does all the more exulting."&lt;ref name=atlantic_brutal/&gt; Martin gets emotionally involved in the characters' lives during writing, which makes the chapters with dreadful events sometimes very difficult to write.&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt; Seeing the world through the characters' eyes requires a certain amount of empathy with them, including the villains,&lt;ref name=deepmagic41/&gt; all of whom he has said he loves as if they were his own children.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_sfsite2/&gt;&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_scotcampus/&gt; Martin found that some characters had minds of their own and took his writing in different directions. He returns to the intended story if it does not work out, but these detours sometimes prove more rewarding for him.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb/&gt;

Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen generate the most feedback from readers.&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_cc/&gt; Martin has stated that Tyrion is his personal favorite, as the grayest of the gray characters, with his cunning and wit making him the most fun to write.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_sfsite2/&gt; Martin has also said that Bran Stark is the hardest character to write. As the character most deeply involved in magic, Bran's story needs to be handled carefully within the supernatural aspects of the books. Bran is also the youngest viewpoint character,&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt; and has to deal with the series' adult themes like grief, loneliness, and anger.&lt;ref name=time_grrm_ivp1/&gt; Martin set out to have the young characters grow up faster between chapters, but, as it was implausible for a character to take two months to respond, a finished book represents very little time passed. Martin hoped the planned five-year break would ease the situation and age the children to almost adults in terms of the Seven Kingdoms, but he later dropped the five-year gap (see section [[#Bridging the timeline gap|Bridging the timeline gap]]).&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_ew/&gt;&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt;

==Themes==
{{Main|Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire}}
&lt;!--DEAR EDITOR: This section is to summarize [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire]] per [[Wikipedia:Summary style]]. Nothing new should be added here unless it is also covered in the Themes main article WITH A RELIABLE SOURCE.--&gt;
[[File:Face in the Pool-Knight Fighting Dragon.jpg|thumb|Although involving dragons and sorcery, ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series de-emphasizes magic as compared to many other epic fantasy works (emblem of [[J. Allen St. John]]'s 1905 fantasy work ''The Face in the Pool'').]]

Although modern fantasy may often embrace strangeness, ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism.&lt;ref name=nytimes_rise_fantasy/&gt; Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre,&lt;ref name=nytimes_twisted/&gt; Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_januarymagazine/&gt; Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies.&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt; In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension,&lt;ref name=nymag_butterfly/&gt; not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells.&lt;ref name=amazon_storm/&gt; As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.&lt;ref name=nytimes_rise_fantasy/&gt;

Since Martin drew on historical sources to build the world of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' ,&lt;ref name=deepmagic41/&gt; Damien G. Walter of ''[[The Guardian]]'' saw a strong resemblance between Westeros and England in the period of the [[Wars of the Roses]].&lt;ref name=guardian_reality/&gt; ''The Atlantic''{{'s}} Adam Serwer regarded ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' as "more a story of politics than one of heroism, a story about humanity wrestling with its baser obsessions than fulfilling its glorious potential", where the emergent power struggle stems from the feudal system's repression and not from the fight between good and evil.&lt;ref name=atlantic_reality/&gt; Martin not only wanted to reflect the frictions of the medieval class structures in the novels, but also explore the consequences of the leaders' decisions, as general goodness does not automatically make competent leaders and vice versa.&lt;ref name=time_grrm_ivp2/&gt;

A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between [[good and evil]],&lt;ref name=time_grrm_ivp2/&gt; which Martin rejects for not mirroring the real world.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_infinityplus/&gt; Attracted to gray characters,&lt;ref name=usatoday_released/&gt; Martin instead endorses [[William Faulkner]]'s view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about.&lt;ref name=time_grrm_ivp2/&gt; Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series.&lt;ref name=guardian_tt/&gt; The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;&lt;ref name=gamepro/&gt;

Although fantasy comes from an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest necessity to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people.&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt; Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might.&lt;ref name=ew_by_george/&gt; The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war.&lt;ref name=grrm_iv_sfsite2/&gt; The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact.&lt;ref name=io9_gods/&gt; Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_ew/&gt;

According to Martin, the fantasy genre rarely focuses on sex and sexuality,&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt; instead often treating sexuality in a juvenile way or neglecting it completely.&lt;ref name=deepmagic41/&gt; Martin, however, considers sexuality an important driving force in human life that should not be excluded from the narrative.&lt;ref name=guardian_tt/&gt; Providing sensory detail for an immersive experience is more important than plot advancement for Martin,&lt;ref name=atlantic_sex_fantasy/&gt; who aims to let the readers experience the novels' sex scenes, "whether it's a great transcendent, exciting, mind blowing sex, or whether it's disturbing, twisted, dark sex, or disappointing perfunctory sex."&lt;ref name=guardian_tt/&gt; Martin was fascinated by medieval contrasts where knights venerated their ladies with poems and wore their favors in tournaments while their armies mindlessly raped women in wartime.&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt; The non-existent concept of adolescence in the Middle Ages served as a model for Daenerys' sexual activity at the age of 13 in the books.&lt;ref name=time_grrm_ivp1/&gt; The novels also allude to the incestuous practices in the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] of [[Ancient Egypt]] to keep their bloodlines pure.&lt;ref name=nytimes_oedipus/&gt;

Martin provides a variety of female characters to explore the place of women in a patriarchal society.&lt;ref name=io9_gods/&gt; Writing all characters as human beings with the same basic needs, dreams, and influences,&lt;ref name=indigo_iv2/&gt; his female characters are to cover the same wide spectrum of human traits as the males.&lt;ref name=io9_gods/&gt;&lt;ref name=indigo_iv2/&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
''[[Science Fiction Weekly]]'' stated in 2000 that "few would dispute that Martin's most monumental achievement to date has been the groundbreaking ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' historical fantasy series",&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt; for which reviews have been "orders of magnitude better" than for his previous works, as Martin described to ''The New Yorker''.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; In 2007, ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine described the series as a "superb fantasy saga" that "raised Martin to a whole new level of success".&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_weirdtm/&gt; Shortly before the release of ''A Dance with Dragons'' in 2011, Bill Sheehan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was sure that "no work of fantasy has generated such anticipation since [[Harry Potter]]'s final duel with Voldemort",&lt;ref name=washingtonpost_worth_wait/&gt; and Ethan Sacks of ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' saw the series turning Martin into a darling of literary critics as well as mainstream readers, which was "rare for a fantasy genre that's often dismissed as garbage not fit to line the bottom of a dragon's cage".&lt;ref name=nydailynews_sample_chapter/&gt; [[Salon.com]]'s [[Andrew Leonard]] stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;The success is all the more remarkable because [the series debuted] without mass market publicity or any kind of buzz in the fantasy/SF scene. George R. R. Martin earned his following the hard way, by word of mouth, by hooking his characters into the psyche of his readers to an extent that most writers of fantasy only dream of.&lt;ref name="salon_primer"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' noted in 2000 that "Martin may not rival [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] or [[Robert Jordan]], but he ranks with such accomplished medievalists of fantasy as [[Poul Anderson]] and [[Gordon R. Dickson|Gordon Dickson]]."&lt;ref name="pw_review_asos"/&gt; After the fourth volume came out in 2005, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'s}} Lev Grossman considered Martin a "major force for evolution in fantasy" and proclaimed him "the American Tolkien", explaining that, although Martin was "[not] the best known of America's straight-up fantasy writers" at the time and would "never win a [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]] or a [[National Book Award]]&amp;nbsp;... his skill as a crafter of narrative exceeds that of almost any literary novelist writing today".&lt;ref name="time_american_tolkien"/&gt; As Grossman said in 2011, the phrase ''American Tolkien'' "has stuck to [Martin], as it was meant to",&lt;ref name="time_masterpiece_tolkien"/&gt; being picked up by the media including ''[[The New York Times]]'' ("He's much better than that"),&lt;ref name="nytimes_adwdreview"/&gt; the ''New Yorker'',&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ("an acclaim that borders on fantasy blasphemy"),&lt;ref name="ew_fantasy_king"/&gt; ''The Globe and Mail'',&lt;ref name="globeandmail"/&gt; and ''USA Today''.&lt;ref name="usatoday_released"/&gt; ''Time'' magazine named Martin one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011,&lt;ref name="globeandmail"/&gt; and ''USA Today'' named George R.R. Martin their Author of the Year 2011.&lt;ref name="usatoday_year"/&gt;

According to ''The Globe and Mail''{{'s}} John Barber, Martin manages simultaneously to master and transcend the genre so that "Critics applaud the depth of his characterizations and lack of cliché in books that are nonetheless replete with dwarves and dragons".&lt;ref name="globeandmail"/&gt; ''Publishers Weekly'' gave favorable reviews to the first three ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels at their points of release, saying that ''A Game of Thrones'' had "superbly developed characters, accomplished prose and sheer bloody-mindedness",&lt;ref name="pw_review_agot"/&gt; that ''A Clash of Kings'' was "notable particularly for the lived-in quality of [their fictional world and] for the comparatively modest role of magic",&lt;ref name="pw_review_acok"/&gt; and that ''A Storm of Swords'' was one "of the more rewarding examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy".&lt;ref name="pw_review_asos"/&gt; However, they found that ''A Feast For Crows'' as the fourth installment "sorely misses its other half. The slim pickings here are tasty, but in no way satisfying."&lt;ref name="pw_review_affc"/&gt; Their review for ''A Dance with Dragons'' repeated points of criticism for the fourth volume, and said that, although "The new volume has a similar feel to ''Feast''", "Martin keeps it fresh by focusing on popular characters [who were] notably absent from the previous book."&lt;ref name="pw_review_adwd"/&gt;

According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "Martin's brilliance in evoking atmosphere through description is an enduring hallmark of his fiction, the settings much more than just props on a painted stage", and the novels captivate readers with "complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing, and the willingness to kill off even his major characters".&lt;ref name="latimes_adwdreview"/&gt; [[CNN]] remarked that "the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style",&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; and David Orr of ''The New York Times'' found that "All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles."&lt;ref name="nytimes_rise_fantasy"/&gt; Salon.com's Andrew Leonard "couldn't stop reading Martin because my desire to know what was going to happen combined with my absolute inability to guess what would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted."&lt;ref name="salon_fantasy_king"/&gt; ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' advised reading the novels with an ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' encyclopedia at hand to "catch all the layered, subtle hints and details that [Martin] leaves throughout his books. If you pay attention, you will be rewarded and questions will be answered."&lt;ref name="csmonitor_adwdreview"/&gt;

Among the most critical voices were Sam Jordison and Michael Hann, both of ''The Guardian''. Jordison detailed his misgivings about ''A Game of Thrones'' in a 2009 review and summarized "It's daft. It's unsophisticated. It's cartoonish. And yet, I couldn't stop reading&amp;nbsp;.... Archaic absurdity aside, Martin's writing is excellent. His dialogue is snappy and frequently funny. His descriptive prose is immediate and atmospheric, especially when it comes to building a sense of deliciously dark foreboding [of the long impending winter]."&lt;ref name="guardian_getting_hooked"/&gt; Hann did not consider the novels to stand out from the general fantasy genre, despite Martin's alterations to fantasy convention, although he rediscovered his childhood's views:&lt;blockquote&gt;That when things are, on the whole, pretty crappy [in the real world], it's a deep joy to dive headfirst into something so completely immersive, something from which there is no need to surface from hours at a time. And if that immersion involves dragons, magic, wraiths from beyond death, shapeshifting wolves and banished princes, so be it.&lt;ref name="guardian_flights_fantasy"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The New Yorker'' said in April 2011 (before the publication of ''A Dance with Dragons'') that more than 15&amp;nbsp;million ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' books had been sold worldwide,&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; a figure repeated by ''The Globe and Mail'' in July 2011.&lt;ref name=globeandmail/&gt; Reuters reported in September 2013 that the books including print, digital and audio versions have sold more than 24&amp;nbsp;million copies in North America.&lt;ref name=reuters_suds/&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported more than six million sold copies in North America by May 2011.&lt;ref name=wsj_season/&gt; ''USA Today'' reported 8.5&amp;nbsp;million copies in print and digital overall in July 2011,&lt;ref name=usatoday_record/&gt; and over 12&amp;nbsp;million sold copies in print in December 2011.&lt;ref name=usatoday_year/&gt; The series has been translated into more than 20 languages;&lt;ref name=grrm_languages/&gt; ''USA Today'' reported the fifth book to be translated into over 40 languages.&lt;ref name=usatoday_released/&gt; ''Forbes'' estimated that Martin was the 12th highest-earning author worldwide in 2011 at $15&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=bercovici20120809/&gt;

Martin's publishers initially expected ''A Game of Thrones'' to be a best-seller,&lt;ref name=ew_fantasy_king/&gt; but the first installment did not even reach any lower positions in bestseller list.&lt;ref name=wsj_spill/&gt; This left Martin unsurprised, as it is "a fool's game to think anything is going to be successful or to count on it".&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_scotcampus/&gt; However, the book slowly won the passionate advocacy of independent booksellers and the book's popularity grew by word of mouth.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; The series' popularity skyrocketed in subsequent volumes,&lt;ref name=ew_fantasy_king/&gt; with the second and third volume making [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller lists]] in 1999&lt;ref name=nytimes_bs990221/&gt; and 2000,&lt;ref name=nytimes_bs001119/&gt; respectively. The series gained Martin's old writings new attention, and Martin's American publisher [[Bantam Spectra]] was to reprint his out-of-print solo novels.&lt;ref name=scifi_magical_tale/&gt;

The fourth installment, ''A Feast for Crows'', was an immediate best-seller at its 2005 release,&lt;ref name=ew_fantasy_king/&gt; hitting number one on "The New York Times" hardcover fiction bestseller list November 27, 2005, which for a fantasy novel suggested that Martin's books were attracting mainstream readers.&lt;ref name=guardian_barbarians/&gt; The paperback edition of ''A Game of Thrones'' reached its 34th printing in 2010, surpassing the one million mark.&lt;ref name=grrm_blog_101006/&gt; Before it even premiered, the TV series had boosted sales of the book series, with ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' approaching triple-digit growth in year-on-year sales. Bantam was looking forward to seeing the tie-ins boost sales further,&lt;ref name=variety_selling/&gt; and Martin's British publisher [[Harper Voyager]] expected readers to rediscover their other epic fantasy literature.&lt;ref name=pw_gains/&gt; With a reported 4.5&amp;nbsp;million copies of the first four volumes in print in early 2011,&lt;ref name=variety_selling/&gt; the four volumes re-appeared on the paperback fiction bestseller lists in the second quarter of 2011.&lt;ref name=nytimes_graph/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes_bestseller/&gt;

At its point of publication in July 2011, ''A Dance with Dragons'' was in its sixth print with more than 650,000 hardbacks in print.&lt;ref name=guardian_charts/&gt; It also had the highest single and first-day sales of any new fiction title published in 2011 at that point, with 170,000 hardcovers, 110,000 e-books, and 18,000 audio books reportedly sold on the first day.&lt;ref name=usatoday_record/&gt; ''A Dance with Dragons'' reached the top of ''The New York Times'' bestseller list on July 31, 2011.&lt;ref name=nytimes_vile_hobbits/&gt; Unlike most other big titles, the fifth volume sold more physical than digital copies early on,&lt;ref name=nytimes_sells_well/&gt; but nevertheless, Martin became the tenth author to sell 1&amp;nbsp;million [[Amazon Kindle]] e-books.&lt;ref name=latimes_kindle/&gt; All five volumes and the four-volume boxed set were among the top 100 best-selling books in the United States in 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref name=usatoday_100best/&gt;

The TV series has contributed significantly boosting sales of both the books and collectibles like box-sets, merchandise, and other items. The TV series also contributed in increasing the geographic coverage of the books, introducing new customers in emerging countries like India and Brazil to the book series. All this has significantly increased the overall book sales.

===Fandom===
{{main|A Song of Ice and Fire fandom}}
During the 1980s and early 1990s, Martin's novels had slowly earned him a reputation in science fiction circles,&lt;ref name=nytimes_dreaming/&gt; although he said to only have received a few fans' letters a year in the pre-internet days.&lt;ref name=deepmagic41/&gt; The publication of ''A Game of Thrones'' caused Martin's following to grow, with fan sites springing up and a [[Trekkie]]-like society of followers evolving that meet regularly.&lt;ref name=nytimes_dreaming/&gt; Westeros.org, one of the main ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' fansites with about seventeen thousand registered members {{as of|2011|lc=y}}, was established in 1999 by a Swedish-based fan of Cuban-American descent, Elio M. García, Jr., and his girlfriend; their involvement with Martin's work has now become semi-professional.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; The Brotherhood Without Banners, an unofficial fan club operating globally, was formed in 2001. Their founders and other longtime members are among Martin's good friends.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt;

Martin runs an official website&lt;ref name=nytimes_vile_hobbits/&gt; and administers a lively blog with the assistance of [[Ty Franck]].&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; He also interacts with fandom by answering emails and letters, although he stated in 2005 that their sheer numbers might leave them unanswered for years.&lt;ref name=deepmagic41/&gt; Since there are different types of conventions nowadays, he tends to go to three or four science-fiction conventions a year simply to go back to his roots and meet friends.&lt;ref name=chictrib_daenerys/&gt; He does not read message boards anymore, so that his writing will not be influenced by fans foreseeing twists and interpreting characters differently from what he intended.&lt;ref name=chictrib_daenerys/&gt;

{{Quote box | quote="After all, as some of you like to point out in your emails, I am sixty years old and fat, and you don't want me to 'pull a [[Robert Jordan]]' on you and deny you your book. Okay, I've got the message. You don't want me doing anything except ''A Song of Ice and Fire''. Ever. (Well, maybe it's okay if I take a leak once in a while?)"| source =—George R. R. Martin on his blog in 2009&lt;ref name=grrm_blog_090219/&gt; | width =250px | align =right}}

While Martin calls the majority of his fans "great", and enjoys interacting with them,&lt;ref name=grmm_iv_ew/&gt; some of them turned against him because of the six years it took to release ''A Dance with Dragons''.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; A movement of disaffected fans called GRRuMblers formed in 2009, creating sites such as ''Finish the Book, George'' and ''Is Winter Coming?''&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt;&lt;ref name=globeandmail/&gt; When fans' vocal impatience for ''A Dance with Dragons'' peaked shortly after, Martin issued a statement called "To My Detractors"&lt;ref name=grrm_blog_090219/&gt; on his blog that received media attention.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian_getting_hooked/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian_exitement/&gt; ''The New York Times'' noted that it was not uncommon for Martin to be mobbed at book signings either.&lt;ref name=nytimes_dreaming/&gt; ''The New Yorker'' called this "an astonishing amount of effort to devote to denouncing the author of books one professes to love. Few contemporary authors can claim to have inspired such passion."&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt;

===Novellas===
Martin has written several [[prequel]] novellas. The ''[[Tales of Dunk and Egg]]'' series, three novellas set ninety years before the events of the novel series, feature the adventures of Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire "Egg", the later King Aegon V Targaryen. The stories have no direct connection to the plot of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', although both characters are mentioned in ''A Storm of Swords'' and ''A Feast For Crows'', respectively. The first installment, ''The Hedge Knight'', was published in the 1998 anthology ''[[Legends (book)|Legends]]''. ''The Sworn Sword'' followed in 2003, published in ''[[Legends II (book)|Legends II]]''.&lt;ref name=gamepro/&gt; Both were later adapted into [[graphic novel]]s.&lt;ref name=pw_adventures/&gt; The third novella, titled ''The Mystery Knight'', was first published in the 2010 anthology ''[[Warriors (anthology)|Warriors]]'',&lt;ref name=suvudu_review/&gt; and is planned to be adapted as a graphic novel as well.&lt;ref name=grrm_blog_130709/&gt; In 2015 the first three novellas were published as one collection, ''A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms''.

The novella ''[[The Princess and the Queen|The Princess and the Queen or, the Blacks and the Greens]]'' appeared in [[Tor Books]]'s 2013 anthology ''[[Dangerous Women (anthology)|Dangerous Women]]'', and explains some of the Targaryen backstory two centuries before the events of the novels.&lt;ref name="Tor July 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name=grrm_blog_130123/&gt; ''[[The Rogue Prince|The Rogue Prince, or, the King's Brother]]'', published in the 2014 anthology ''[[Rogues (anthology)|Rogues]]'', is itself a prequel to the events of ''The Princess and the Queen''.&lt;ref name=zap2it_rogue/&gt; The novella ''[[The Sons of the Dragon]]'' appeared in the 2017 anthology ''[[The Book of Swords (anthology)|The Book of Swords]]'', is the story of Aegon the Conqueror's two sons Aenys I and Maegor I "the cruel".

Chapter sets from the novels were also compiled into three novellas that were released between 1996 and 2003 by ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'' and ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'':
* ''Blood of the Dragon'' (July 1996),&lt;ref name=excerpt_botd/&gt; taken from the Daenerys chapters in ''A Game of Thrones''.
* ''Path of the Dragon'' (December 2000),&lt;ref name=excerpt_potd/&gt; taken from the Daenerys chapters in ''A Storm of Swords''.
* ''Arms of the Kraken'' (March 2003),&lt;ref name=excerpt_aofk/&gt; based on the Iron Islands chapters from ''A Feast for Crows''.

With the popularity of the series growing, [[HBO]] optioned ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' for a television adaptation in 2007.&lt;ref name="variety2007-01"/&gt; A pilot episode was produced in late 2009, and a [[Game of Thrones (season 1)|series commitment for nine further episodes]] was made in March 2010.&lt;ref name=bbc_appeal/&gt; The series, titled ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', premiered in April 2011 to great acclaim and ratings (see [[Game of Thrones#Reception|''Game of Thrones'': Reception]]).

[[File:Le Nain Adoration NG.jpg|thumb|300px|''Adoration of the Shepherds'' by the [[Le Nain Brothers]]]]
[[File:Louis Le Nain 005.jpg|thumb|''The Milkmaid's Family'', a more typical Le Nain painting thought to date to 1641, with similar donkey.]]
[[File:Laurent de La Hyre - Mercury Takes Bacchus to be Brought up by Nymphs - WGA12322.jpg|thumb|''Mercury confiding Bacchus to the Nymphs'', [[Laurent de La Hyre]], dated 1638, with a similar setting]]

The '''''Adoration of the Shepherds''''' by the [[Le Nain Brothers]] is in the [[National Gallery]] in London. The painting dates from about 1640, and is relatively unusual as a religious subject or [[history painting]] in their ''oeuvre''; they are best known for [[genre painting]], especially groups of peasants. As with most of the works of Antoine (c 1600–1648), Louis (c. 1603?–1648) and Mathieu (1607–1677) Le Nain, it is not possible to establish which brother, or combination of brothers, painted it.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 194, 208; for an older and opposing view, see Blunt, 155–156, who describes distinct styles and types of work for each brother.&lt;/ref&gt; This painting is unsigned, but when they signed their works, from 1641 to 1648, it was simply as ''Lenain''.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting is in oil on canvas and in good condition, with minor losses; it measures {{convert|109.2|x|138.7|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The ''[[Adoration of the Shepherds]]'' is a very common subject in the [[Nativity of Jesus in art]], and the composition is an arrangement of the conventional components, including the [[Holy Family]], the [[ox]] and ass or [[donkey]], angels, and three shepherds, two old and one young. One shepherd and an angel are glancing out to the viewer's left, and it has been suggested that they have seen the approach of the [[Biblical Magi]], which may have been the subject of a matching painting. There are ''[[pentimenti]]'' showing what appears to have been the original composition: on the wall above the lefthand angel dim traces of a head of the Virgin can be seen, slightly bowed to the left matching [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] just to her right. On the donkey the trace of a curved rein can be seen, starting where the white chest meets the foreleg; the whole animal may originally have been lower.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 206–207&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Michael Levey]] describes the treatment of the scene as "partly 'realistic' and humbly rustic and partly idealized",&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 211&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Gallery detect the influence of [[Orazio Gentileschi]], who had worked in Paris, in the figures of Mary and Joseph, and the ass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/the-le-nain-brothers-the-adoration-of-the-shepherds National Gallery page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dates in the 1630s have been suggested, and also that the painting is by Mathieu, or Louis.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 208–209 for date, and recording rather than endorsing the attribution to Mathieu; Levey, 211 attributes it to Louis.&lt;/ref&gt;  Elements of the architectural setting have been compared to those in a painting by [[Laurent de La Hyre]] in the [[Hermitage Museum]] dated 1638, ''Mercury confiding Bacchus to the Nymphs'' (in reverse), and the ass is very similar to that in ''The Milkmaid's Family'', also in the Hermitage, a Le Nain painting thought to date to 1641.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 208–210&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ''Adoration'' attributed to the brothers, and at least in a similar style, in the [[National Gallery of Ireland]], which shares some aspects of the composition.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 210&lt;/ref&gt;  Another, more realist, ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' in [[the Louvre]] was long attributed to the Le Nains, but is now given to [[Jean Michelin]] and dated 1659.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=14544&amp;langue=en Louvre]; Blunt, 155, has the old attribution.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
As with most Le Nain paintings, the original commissioner is not known, nor whether it was intended for a church or other religious institution, or a domestic setting.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 194; Blunt, 157&lt;/ref&gt; It first appears in England in the 1770s. Possibly it was the painting of the subject sold at [[Christie's]] 7 February 1771, as by Le Nain (lot 21), realizing the good price of £42, and/or that sold on 20 March 1773, again at Christie's, this time for only £14 4s 6d (lot 85, as "Le Naine"). It was certainly at [[Blenheim Palace]] by 1777, now attributed to [[Luca Giordano]], in the collection of [[George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough]]. It remained in the Marlborough collection until the epic sales in the 1880s of the [[George Spencer-Churchill, 8th Duke of Marlborough|8th Duke]], when it was once again sold at Christie's on 7 August 1886 (lot 652, £52 10s), bought by a dealer. It was later bought by [[Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk]] and is recorded as hanging in the "Prince's Bedroom" at [[Arundel Castle]] in 1902, still as a Giordano. In 1962 it was sold by [[Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk|the 16th Duke]] to the National Gallery, as a Le Nain. It is catalogued as NG 6331, and hangs in Room 18.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 206, whose notes suggest (n. 10) that the misattribution to Giordano may have been deliberate, to increase the market value paid by the Duke, and that Charles Davis of 147 [[New Bond Street]], the dealer who bought the work in 1886, acted for the Duke of Norfolk &amp; may have done so here, or sold it to him later (n. 4).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ancient Cypriot art''' refers to all works of [[Visual arts|visual art]] originating from [[Cyprus]] in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] from c. 10,000 BC to c. 330 AD.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/ancient-art-from-cyprus-in-the-cesnola-collection-the-cesnola-collection-in-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art/oclc/469681412&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Ancient art from Cyprus in the Cesnola collection: the Cesnola collection in the Metropolitan Museum of art|last=Karagiorgis|first=Vasos|last2=Mertens|first2=Joan R|last3=Rose|first3=Marice E|date=2000|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-0870999444|location=New York|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, various types of objects were produced such as domestic tools, weaponry, jewellery, and decorative figurines. This range of art attests to the blend of both native and foreign influences of [[ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] as they successively occupied the country.

=== Pre-Neolithic (c. 10,000 - c. 8500 BC) and Neolithic (c. 8500 - c. 3900 BC) Periods ===
In c. 10,000 BC, seasonal hunters of pygmy hippopotami and elephants were present on the island. The first [[Neolithic]] settlers in Cyprus originated from either the Syro-Palestinian coast or southern [[Anatolia]], forming communities founded on [[agriculture]]. It was towards the end of the Neolithic period when people began to bake moulded clay into vessels which were frequently embellished with abstract designs in red on a light [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hemingway, Colette, and Seán Hemingway. “Prehistoric Cypriot Art and Culture.” In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pcyp/hd_pcyp.htm (October 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Pottery, Early Cypriot I period, 2500-2075 BC, UC, 154761.jpg|thumb|Pottery of the Early Cypriot I period (c. 2500 - c. 2075 BC)|228x228px]]

=== Chalcolithic Period (c. 3900 - c. 2500 BC) ===
During this period, a new flood of Syro-Palestinian and Anatolian migrants introduced a more advanced culture where religion was practised and art processes became more complex. Examples of such art are that of female [[Figurine|figurines]] formed from [[clay]] or [[Rock (geology)|stone]]—in particular the local stone picrolite—with prominent genitals which represented [[fertility]] as one of the crucial values of [[agrarian society]] at the time. Towards the end of this period, small implements and ornamental decorations began to be hammered from [[copper]], ''chalkos'' in Greek, hence giving the name of this era of progression from the Neolithic Period to the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite the continuation of agriculture, certain developments such as diversified burial procedures, the building of unique religious installations, and the use of [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] indicate a more sophisticated and organised society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cycladic.gr/en/page/istoria-tis-kiprou|title=THE HISTORY OF CYPRUS|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Museum of Cycladic Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Bronze Age (c. 2500 - c. 1900 BC) ===
Profound changes caused by incoming coastal Asia Minor migrants and other intra-societal processes marked the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. Communities began to move, settling in areas of fertile land near sources of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Influences from the [[Near East]], where [[metallurgy]] was highly developed, established standardised procedures of mining, extracting, and smelting of the rich copper [[Ore|ores]] found in Cyprus. This resource would become a valued export of high demand throughout Mediterranean antiquity during the Middle Bronze Age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although Cypriot society was still rooted in agriculture, bronze-smiths began to manufacture unique ornaments and tools following personal techniques towards the end of Early Bronze Age.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Red polished cypriot flask Antikensammlung Kiel.jpg|thumb|Red polished Cypriot flask (c. 2200 - c. 1700 BC)|337x337px]]

=== Middle Bronze Age (c. 1900 - c. 1650 BC) ===
The distinctive geographical location of Cyprus in the centre of Eastern Mediterranean maritime [[trade]] allowed for the country to become a significant commercial hub. This advantage also provided the country the ability to build contacts with Egypt, the Near East, [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Crete]], and [[Mycenaean Greece]]. However, despite progressive social organisation, the profound distinctions in wealth as evidenced in burials highlight the explicit social divisions at the time. Such divide and local disputes resulted in the construction of [[Fortification|fortifications]] in many settlements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The shapes and designs of [[pottery]] produced in the Early and Middle Bronze Ages were innovative and creative. Terracotta was used extensively to produce statuettes for tomb burials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cesnola Collection of Cypriot Art: terracottas|last=VASSOS.|first=KARAGEORGHIS,|date=2016|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300227192|location=[S.l.]|oclc=967270977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other burial items, particularly those for men, consisted of bronze weaponry and tools. Cylinder seals and use of gold and silver for jewellery were gradually popularised as well. With the increasing need for more complex ways of expressing religion, ceremonial sites and unique metalworks were constructed. Such constructions give evidence of the growing significance of metals like copper in Cyprus. By the end of the Bronze Age, Near Eastern and Aegean influences allowed for Cyprus to develop the art of [[engraving]] and [[carving]] to a large extent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Late Bronze Age (c. 1650 - c. 1050 BC) ===

During the Late Bronze Age, Cyprus was producing copper on a colossal scale and exporting it throughout the entire Eastern Mediterranean to be bartered for commodities and luxury goods. Various works of [[alabaster]] and [[faience]], displayed within The Cesnola Collection, were imported from Egypt during the first half of the 14th century BC. The recent archaeological discovery off the Anatolian coast of ten tonnes of copper in a 14th century BC [[Uluburun shipwreck|shipwreck at Ulu Burun]] show the large scope of Cyprus’ seafaring commerce. Jars holding Cypriot pottery and products of agriculture such as coriander were also found in the excavation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Antikensammlung Kiel 220.JPG|left|thumb|Cypriot vessel of the Red Polished Ware II-III period (c. 2200 - c. 1700 BC)|alt=|229x229px]]
By the Late Bronze Age, Cypriot art could be seen as a mixture of both domestic pressures and foreign influences. Adaptations of foreign stylistic elements from the Aegean, the Near East, and Egypt led to their reinterpretation and as a result incorporation into unique Cypriot customs. Particularly during the 12th century BC, bronze-work, writing, jewellery, and stone seal carvings were all influenced by the Aegean. From c. 1500 BC, Cypriots commenced using an [[Cypro-Minoan syllabary|undecipherable Cypro-Minoan script]] adopted from Crete which gave them the means to manage records and inventories at a time when social organisation was becoming increasingly complex.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This script can be seen on clay tablets and records found in metropolitan cities such as [[Enkomi]] and [[Kalavasos]]. The Cesnola Collection also contains numerous vases on which some characters of this ancient script is visible. Upon excavations of rich burial grounds and 14th to 13th century BC urban centres like Enkomi, luxurious artefacts made from a range of materials have been discovered. Burial chambers of an elite class have further unearthed nearly exclusively a collection of imported Mycenaean vessels from the 14th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While the arts in Cyprus thrived, social inequities arose as a result of the flux of imported wealth and resources. During the latter part of the 13th century BC, unrest took over Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean, leaving cities in ruins and generating a surge of Aegean refugees to Cyprus. However, despite the turmoil, Cyprus managed to eventually recover its economic and commercial success.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Amphoriskos, Cypriot, Cypro-Geometric II-III, c. 950-750 BC, terracotta - Middlebury College Museum of Art - Middlebury, VT - DSC07983.jpg|thumb|Terracotta from the Cypro-Geometric II-III period (c. 950 - c. 750 BC)|194x194px]]

== Cypro-Geometric Period (c. 1050 - c. 750 BC) ==
After its recuperation, new settlements arose in Cyprus as a result of the influx of Greek and Achaean immigrants who brought with them their Mycenaean culture in the forms of pottery, clothing, weaponry, burial customs, and the Greek language. The country maintained its role as a main exporter of raw materials in the Mediterranean, and eventually introduced a new local syllabic script in the 11th century BC which was in use until the 3rd century BC for the writing of ancient Greek and Cypriot language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The establishment of a [[Phoenicia|Phoenician]] settlement at [[Kition]] on the southern coast in around 900 BC further pushed Cyprus’ trade as the Phoenicians were interested in the plentiful copper and wood resources for [[shipbuilding]]. With this, the Phoenician language was adopted, and foreign ideas such as the cult of the goddess [[Astarte]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; were assimilated into Cypriot culture. However, despite such imported customs at the time, Cypriot art managed to maintain its native characteristics. Pottery of this period was generally produced from Proto-White Painted Ware, but the Cypriots also painted in black and red.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Advancements in the political structure of society could be seen in the founding of ten kingdoms ruled by kings called ''wanaktes'',&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Department of Greek and Roman Art. “Geometric and Archaic Cyprus.” In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gcyp/hd_gcyp.htm (October 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; as evidenced in a 7th century BC inscription. [[File:Limestone stele (shaft) with the head of Hathor MET DP263876.jpg|thumb|263x263px|Limestone stele with the head of Hathor from Cyprus (c. 575 - c. 550 BC)]]

== Cypro-Archaic Period (c. 750 - c. 480 BC) ==
Evidence revealing the surrender of the Cypriot rulers to [[Assyria]] in 709 BC was found on a [[stele]] at Kition&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, and the kingdoms remained under Assyrian rule until 669 BC.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Prosperity and cultural incitement in the kingdoms followed, and the kings of Cyprus were able to self-rule as long as they paid frequent [[tribute]] to the king of Assyria. The riches and foreign relations of these Cypriot kings can be seen in evidence found in royal burial chambers at [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]]. In 669 BC, Cyprus became independent, a rare circumstance in Cypriot history that lasted until the country was subjugated by Egypt under [[Amasis II]] in 560 BC. During this time, the extent of Egyptian control was evident in the increasing use of Egyptian symbols in Cypriot art, such as the head of [[Hathor]] which was found commonly on art pieces from [[Amathus]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It could also be seen in the many stone sculptures of male votaries. Cypriot sculpture in the Cypro-Archaic Period was characterised by [[polychrome]] decoration which was also used in Greece. Terracotta during this time was often painted, and the development of the mould meant that figurine production could be accelerated to a great extent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 545 BC, Cyprus was conquered by [[Cyrus the Great]] of [[Persian Empire|Persia]], but allied with the [[Ionians|Ionian Greeks]] in 499 BC in attempt to rebel against the Persian invaders. Undeterred by the fluctuations in power, Cyprus remained prosperous as a pivotal trade hub&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, and religious practices did not change with new rule.

== Cypro-Classical Period (c. 480 - c. 310 BC) ==
Until Cyprus was liberated by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333 BC, there was a constant power struggle for Cypriot independence against the Persians. During the Cypro-Classical era, sculptures, jewellery, clothing, and other art forms began to take on many Hellenic elements as a result of increased affiliation with the Greeks who aided the Cypriots in their attempts to depose the Persians.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sculptures in this period were generally made from terracotta or limestone and could only be afforded by the affluent. Although the influence of Greek culture was evident in the arts of Cyprus, the Cypriots still kept and used their own artistic styles. One prominent example is that of a Golgoi [[sarcophagus]] adorned with warriors in battle which is a scene commonly seen in Greek art. However, the Cypriot artist combines a hunting scene with this landscape, whereby the proportions of the animals are clearly distinctive from those found in Hellenic works. Similarly, Cypriot jewellery, in particular those made from gold, reveal a combination of both local and Greek artistic styles. East Greek influences from the sixth century BC gave rise to freestanding Cypriot sculptures that exhibited common Hellenic features such as the subtle smile and forward left foot.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Greek and Roman Art. “Classical Cyprus (ca. 480–ca. 310 B.C.).” In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''.

== Hellenistic and Roman Periods (c. 310 BC - c. 330 AD) ==
Art in Cyprus eventually came to assimilate [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] elements as the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemies]] conquered the country in 300 BC. Although artistic elements of ancient Athens influenced Cypriot burial architecture and other art forms in the beginning, Egyptian styles ultimately superseded. After the Romans seized control in 58 BC, Cyprus once again became a vibrant trading centre. Eastern Mediterranean traders and artists, including sculptors, brought with them a range of foreign artistic practices as they entered the country. As marble and bronze sculptures were increasingly imported from the Aegean, traditional limestone sculptures started to diminish.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Hellenistic elements were still prevalent in Cypriot sculpture, ceramics and jewellery during this time. Ultimately, all forms of Cypriot art became influenced by Roman techniques and styles.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Greek and Roman Art. “Hellenistic and Roman Cyprus.” In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''.

==Collections==
Outside Cyprus, there are large collections in several museums, notably the [[British Museum]] and [[Louvre]]. One of the most extensive collections of ancient Cypriot art is The Cesnola Collection which is in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York. This inventory was amassed through personal investments and excavations by [[Luigi Palma di Cesnola]] who was an American consul based in Cyprus in 1865, before becoming the first director of the Metropolitan.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Greek and Roman Art. “The Cesnola Collection at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.” In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2842">'''Aretalogy''' ({{lang-el|Αρεταλογία}}), from ἀρετή (aretḗ, “virtue”) + -[[logy]], is a form of sacred biography where a [[deity]]'s attributes are listed, in the form of poem or text, in the first person.  

==Usage==
Often each line starts with the standard "I am …".  Usually, aretalogies are self praising.  They are found in the sacred texts of later [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egypt]], [[Mesopotamian mythology|Mesopotamia]] and in [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greco]]-[[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman]] times. Aretalogies of [[Isis]] would be recited every day by an aretalogist who would have to memorise a huge list of attributes which he/she would have to recite.(Priests and priestesses of Isis had equal rank in the temple.) The aretalogies of ancient Egypt provide some the most complete information extant about their deities.&lt;ref&gt;Lesko, Barbara S. (1999) ''The Great Goddesses of Egypt'' University of Oklahoma, Norman, pp. 196-199, {{ISBN|0-8061-3202-7}} &lt;/ref&gt; Aretalogies are found as early as the [[Coffin Texts]]. In a [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemeic]] aretalogy, [[Isis|Aset (Isis)]] says about herself:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
I am Isis, ruler of every land.
I was taught by Hermes (Thoth) and with Hermes devised letters, both hieroglyphic and demotic, that all might not be written with the same.
I gave laws to mankind and ordained what no one can change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Barbara S.

An '''artificial cell''' or '''minimal cell''' is an engineered particle that mimics one or many functions of a [[Cell (biology)|biological cell]]. The term does not refer to a specific physical entity, but rather to the idea that certain functions or structures of biological cells can be replaced or supplemented with a synthetic entity. Often, artificial cells are biological or polymeric membranes which enclose biologically active materials. As such, [[nanoparticle]]s, [[liposome]]s, [[polymersome]]s, microcapsules and a number of other particles have qualified as artificial cells. [[Micro-encapsulation]] allows for [[metabolism]] within the membrane, exchange of small molecules and prevention of passage of large substances across it.&lt;ref name="Chang 2007"&gt;{{cite book | last=Chang | first=Thomas Ming Swi | title=Artificial cells : biotechnology, nanomedicine, regenerative medicine, blood substitutes, bioencapsulation, cell/stem cell therapy | year=2007 | publisher=World Scientific | location=Hackensack, N.J. | isbn=981-270-576-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prakash" /&gt; The main advantages of encapsulation include improved mimicry in the body, increased [[solubility]] of the cargo and decreased [[immune system|immune responses]]. Notably, artificial cells have been clinically successful in [[hemoperfusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Charles G. | last=Gebelein | title=Polymeric materials and artificial organs based on a symposium sponsored by the Division of Organic Coatings and Plastics Chemistry at the 185th Meeting of the American Chemical Society | year=1983 | publisher=American Chemical Society | location=Washington, D.C. | isbn=978-0-8412-1084-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of [[synthetic biology]], a "living" artificial cell has been defined as a completely synthetically made cell that can capture [[energy]], maintain [[electrochemical gradient|ion gradients]], contain [[macromolecule]]s as well as store information and have the ability to [[mutate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Deamer | first=D | title=A giant step towards artificial life? | journal=Trends in Biotechnology | date=July 2005 | volume=23 | issue=7 | pages=336–8 | pmid=15935500 | doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2005.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a cell is not technically feasible yet, but a variation of an artificial cell has been created in which a completely synthetic [[genome]] was introduced to genomically emptied host cells.&lt;ref name="gibson52"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gibson | first=D.

==History==
The first artificial cells were developed by [[Thomas Chang]] at [[McGill University]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Chang | first=TM | title=Semipermeable microscapsules. | journal=Science | year=1964 | volume=146 | issue = 3643 | pages=524–525 | doi=10.1126/science.146.3643.524 | pmid=14190240}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cells consisted of ultrathin membranes of nylon, collodion or crosslinked protein whose [[semipermeable]] properties allowed [[diffusion]] of small molecules in and out of the cell.

==Materials==

[[File:Artificial cell membranes.png|thumb|450px|alt=Different types of artificial cell membranes. |Representative types of artificial cell membranes.]]

Membranes for artificial cells be made of simple [[polymers]], crosslinked proteins, [[lipid membranes]] or polymer-lipid complexes. Further, membranes can be engineered to present surface [[proteins]] such as [[albumin]], [[antigens]], [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na/K-ATPase]] carriers, or pores such as [[ion channels]].
Commonly used materials for the production of membranes include hydrogel polymers such as [[alginic acid|alginate]], [[cellulose]] and [[thermoplastic]] polymers such as hydroxyethyl methacrylate-methyl methacrylate (HEMA- MMA), polyacrylonitrile-polyvinyl chloride (PAN-PVC), as well as variations of the above-mentioned.&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt; The material used determines the permeability of the cell membrane, which for polymer depends on the [[Molecular Weight Cut Off|molecular weight cut off]] (MWCO).&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt; The MWCO is the maximum molecular weight of a molecule that may freely pass through the pores and is important in determining adequate [[diffusion]] of nutrients, waste and other critical molecules.
Hydrophilic polymers have the potential to be [[Biocompatibility|biocompatible]] and can be fabricated into a variety of forms which include polymer [[micelles]], [[sol-gel]] mixtures, physical blends and crosslinked particles and nanoparticles.&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt; Of special interest are stimuli-responsive polymers that respond to [[pH]] or temperature changes for the use in targeted delivery. These polymers may be administered in the liquid form through a macroscopic injection and solidify or gel ''in situ'' because of the difference in pH or temperature. [[Nanoparticle]] and [[liposome]] preparations are also routinely used for material encapsulation and delivery.  A major advantage of liposomes is their ability to [[Lipid bilayer fusion|fuse]] to cell and [[organelle]] membranes.

==Preparation==
Many variations for artificial cell preparation and encapsulation have been developed. Typically, vesicles such as a [[Nanoparticle#Synthesis|nanoparticle]], [[Polymersome#Preparation|polymersome]] or [[Liposome#Manufacturing|liposome]] are synthesized. An emulsion is typically made through the use of high pressure equipment such as a high pressure [[homogenizer]] or a [[Microfluidizer]]. Two [[micro-encapsulation]] methods for nitrocellulose are also described below.

===High-pressure homogenization===
In a high-pressure homogenizer, two liquids in oil/liquid suspension are forced through a small orifice under very high pressure. This process divides the products and allows the creation of extremely fine particles, as small as 1&amp;nbsp;nm.

===Microfluidization===
This technique uses a patented Microfluidizer to obtain a greater amount of homogenous suspensions that can create smaller particles than homogenizers. A homogenizer is first used to create a coarse suspension which is then pumped into the microfluidizer under high pressure. The flow is then split into two streams which will react at very high velocities in an interaction chamber until desired particle size is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Vivier | first=A | last2=Vuillemard | first2=JC | last3=Ackermann | first3=HW | last4=Poncelet | first4=D | title=Large-scale blood substitute production using a microfluidizer | journal=Biomaterials, Artificial Cells, and Immobilization Biotechnology |year=1992 | volume=20 | issue=2–4 | pages=377–97 | pmid=1391454 | doi=10.3109/10731199209119658}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique allows for large scale production of phospholipid liposomes and subsequent material nanoencapsulations.

===Drop method===
In this method, a cell solution is incorporated dropwise into a [[collodion]] solution of cellulose nitrate. As the drop travels through the collodion, it is coated with a membrane thanks to the interfacial polymerization properties of the collodion. The cell later settles into paraffin where the membrane sets and is finally suspended a saline solution. The drop method is used for the creation of large artificial cells which encapsulate biological cells, stem cells and genetically engineered stem cells.

===Emulsion method===
The [[emulsion]] method differs in that the material to be encapsulated is usually smaller and is placed in the bottom of a reaction chamber where the collodion is added on top and centrifuged, or otherwise disturbed in order to create an emulsion. The encapsulated material is then dispersed and suspended in saline solution.

==Clinical relevance==

===Drug release and delivery===
Artificial cells used for [[drug delivery]] differ from other artificial cells since their contents are intended to diffuse out of the membrane, or be engulfed and digested by a host target cell. Often used are submicron, lipid membrane artificial cells that may be referred to as nanocapsules, nanoparticles, polymersomes, or other variations of the term.

===Enzyme therapy===
[[Enzyme]] therapy is being actively studied for [[inborn error of metabolism|genetic metabolic diseases]] where an enzyme is over-expressed, under-expressed, defective, or not at all there. In the case of under-expression or expression of a defective [[enzyme]], an active form of the enzyme is introduced in the body to compensate for the deficit. On the other hand, an enzymatic over-expression may be counteracted by introduction of a competing non-functional enzyme; that is, an enzyme which [[Metabolism|metabolizes]] the substrate into non-active products. When placed within an artificial cell, enzymes can carry out their function for a much longer period compared to free enzymes&lt;ref name= 'Chang 2007' /&gt; and can be further optimized by polymer conjugation.&lt;ref&gt;Park et al 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

The first enzyme studied under artificial cell encapsulation was [[asparaginase]] for the treatment of [[lymphosarcoma]] in mice. This treatment delayed the onset and growth of the [[tumor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=TM|title=The in vivo effects of semipermeable microcapsules containing L-asparaginase on 6C3HED lymphosarcoma.|journal=Nature|date=8 January 1971 |volume=229|issue=5280|pages=117–8|pmid=4923094|doi=10.1038/229117a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These initial findings led to further research in the use of artificial cells for enzyme delivery in [[tyrosine]] dependent [[melanomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yu|first=B|author2=Chang, TM|title=Effects of long-term oral administration of polymeric microcapsules containing tyrosinase on maintaining decreased systemic tyrosine levels in rats.|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|date=April 2004 |volume=93|issue=4|pages=831–7|pmid=14999721|doi=10.1002/jps.10593}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tumors have a higher dependency on [[tyrosine]] than normal cells for growth, and research has shown that lowering systemic levels of tyrosine in mice can inhibit growth of melanomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meadows|first=GG|author2=Pierson, HF|author3=Abdallah, RM|author4=Desai, PR|title=Dietary influence of tyrosine and phenylalanine on the response of B16 melanoma to carbidopa-levodopa methyl ester chemotherapy.|journal=Cancer Research|date=August 1982 |volume=42|issue=8|pages=3056–63|pmid=7093952}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of artificial cells in the delivery of [[tyrosinase]]; and enzyme that digests tyrosine, allows for better enzyme stability and is shown effective in the removal of tyrosine without the severe side-effects associated with tyrosine depravation in the diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=TM|title=Artificial cell bioencapsulation in macro, micro, nano, and molecular dimensions: keynote lecture.|journal=Artificial cells, blood substitutes, and immobilization biotechnology|date=February 2004 |volume=32|issue=1|pages=1–23|pmid=15027798|doi=10.1081/bio-120028665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial cell enzyme therapy is also of interest for the activation of [[prodrugs]] such as [[ifosfamide]] in certain cancers. Artificial cells encapsulating the [[cytochrome p450]] enzyme which converts this prodrug into the active drug can be tailored to accumulate in the pancreatic carcinoma or implanting the artificial cells close to the tumor site. Here, the local concentration of the activated ifosfamide will be much higher than in the rest of the body thus preventing systemic [[toxicity]].&lt;ref name='Lohr'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Microencapsulated, CYP2B1-transfected cells activating ifosfamide at the site of the tumor; the magic bullets of the 21st century|journal=Cancer Chemother Pharmacol|year=2002|volume=49|pages=S21–24|pmid=12042985|doi=10.1007/s00280-002-0448-0|vauthors=Löhr M, Hummel F, Faulmann G, Ringel J, Saller R, Hain J, Günzburg WH, Salmons B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment was successful in animals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intraarterial instillation of microencapsulated cells in the pancreatic arteries in pig|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=1999|volume=3|pmid=12649565|doi=10.1159/000069147|issue=1|pages=55–63|vauthors=Kröger JC, Benz S, Hoffmeyer A, Bago Z, Bergmeister H, Günzburg WH, Karle P, Klöppel G, Losert U, Müller P, Nizze H, Obermaier R, Probst A, Renner M, Saller R, Salmons B, Schwendenwein I, von Rombs K, Wiessner R, Wagner T, Hauenstein K, Löhr M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and showed a doubling in median survivals amongst patients with advanced-stage [[pancreatic cancer]] in phase I/II clinical trials, and a tripling in one-year survival rate.&lt;ref name=Lohr/&gt;

===Gene therapy===
In treatment of genetic diseases, [[gene therapy]] aims to insert, alter or remove [[genes]] within an afflicted individual's cells. The technology relies heavily on viral [[vector (molecular biology)|vectors]] which raises concerns about insertional [[mutagenesis]] and systemic [[immune response]] that have led to human deaths&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carmen|first=I|title=A Death in the Laboratory: The Politics of the Gelsinger Aftermath|journal=Molecular Therapy|date=1 April 2001 |volume=3|issue=4|pages=425–428|doi=10.1006/mthe.2001.0305|pmid=11319902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chirmule N, Lee FS, Wivel NA, Bagg A, Gao GP, Wilson JM, Batshaw ML |title=Fatal systemic inflammatory response syndrome in a ornithine transcarbamylase deficient patient following adenoviral gene transfer|journal=Molecular Genetics and Metabolism|date=1 September 2003 |volume=80|issue=1–2|pages=148–158|doi=10.1016/j.ymgme.2003.08.016|pmid=14567964}}&lt;/ref&gt; and development of [[leukemia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cavazzana-Calvo|first=M.|title=Gene Therapy of Human Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)-X1 Disease|journal=Science|date=28 April 2000 |volume=288|issue=5466|pages=669–672|doi=10.1126/science.288.5466.669|pmid=10784449|last2=Hacein-Bey|first2=S|last3=De Saint Basile|first3=G|last4=Gross|first4=F|last5=Yvon|first5=E|last6=Nusbaum|first6=P|last7=Selz|first7=F|last8=Hue|first8=C|last9=Certain|first9=S|last10=Casanova|first10=J.

Circumventing the need for vectors by using naked or plasmid DNA as its own delivery system also encounters problems such as low [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]] efficiency and poor tissue targeting when given systemically.&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt;

Artificial cells have been proposed as a non-viral vector by which genetically modified non-autologous cells are encapsulated and implanted to deliver recombinant proteins ''in vivo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=P|title=The in vivo delivery of heterologous proteins by microencapsulated recombinant cells|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|date=1 February 1999 |volume=17|issue=2|pages=78–83|doi=10.1016/S0167-7799(98)01250-5|pmid=10087608|last2=Van Raamsdonk|first2=J.

===Hemoperfusion===
The first clinical use of artificial cells was in [[hemoperfusion]] by the encapsulation of [[activated charcoal]].&lt;ref name="Chang 1996"/&gt; Activated charcoal has the capability of adsorbing many large molecules and has for a long time been known for its ability to remove toxic substances from the blood in accidental poisoning or overdose. However, [[perfusion]] through direct charcoal administration is toxic as it leads to [[embolism]]s and damage of blood cells followed by removal by platelets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DUNEA|first=G|author2=KOLFF, WJ|title=CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE YATZIDIS CHARCOAL ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY.|journal=Transactions - American Society for Artificial Internal Organs|year=1965|volume=11|pages=178–82|pmid=14329080|doi=10.1097/00002480-196504000-00035}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artificial cells allow toxins to diffuse into the cell while keeping the dangerous cargo within their ultrathin membrane.&lt;ref name= 'Chang 1996' /&gt;

Artificial cell [[hemoperfusion]] has been proposed as a less costly and more efficient detoxifying option than [[hemodialysis]],&lt;ref name="Chang 2007"/&gt; in which blood filtering takes place only through size separation by a physical membrane.  In hemoperfusion, thousands of adsorbent artificial cells are retained inside a small container through the use of two screens on either end through which patient blood [[perfusion|perfuses]]. As the blood circulates, [[toxins]] or drugs diffuse into the cells and are retained by the absorbing material. The membranes of artificial cells are much thinner those used in dialysis and their small size means that they have a high membrane [[surface area]]. This means that a portion of cell can have a theoretical mass transfer that is a hundredfold higher than that of a whole artificial kidney machine.&lt;ref name='Chang 2007' /&gt; The device has been established as a routine clinical method for patients treated for accidental or suicidal poisoning but has also been introduced as therapy in [[liver failure]] and [[renal failure|kidney failure]] by carrying out part of the function of these organs.&lt;ref name= 'Chang 2007' /&gt;
Artificial cell hemoperfusion has also been proposed for use in immunoadsorption through which antibodies can be removed from the body by attaching an immunoadsorbing material such as [[albumin]] on the surface of the artificial cells. This principle has been used to remove [[blood type|blood group]] antibodies from plasma for bone marrow transplantation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bensinger|first=WI|author2=Buckner, CD|author3=Clift, RA|title=Whole blood immunoadsorption of anti-A or anti-B antibodies.|journal=Vox sanguinis|year=1985|volume=48|issue=6|pages=357–61|pmid=3892895|doi=10.1111/j.1423-0410.1985.tb00196.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the treatment of [[hypercholesterolemia]] through [[monoclonal antibodies]] to remove low-density [[lipoproteins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=L|author2=Cheng, Y|author3=Yan, WR|author4=Yu, YT|title=Extracorporeal whole blood immunoadsorption of autoimmune myasthenia gravis by cellulose tryptophan adsorbent.|journal=Artificial cells, blood substitutes, and immobilization biotechnology|year=2004|volume=32|issue=4|pages=519–28|pmid=15974179|doi=10.1081/bio-200039610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemoperfusion is especially useful in countries with a weak hemodialysis manufacturing industry as the devices tend to be cheaper there and used in [[renal failure|kidney failure]] patients.

===Encapsulated cells===

[[File:Cell capsule schematic.png|thumb|300px|alt=Schematic of cells encapsulated within an artificial membrane.|Schematic representation of encapsulated cells within artificial membrane.]]

The most common method of preparation of artificial cells is through [[cell encapsulation]]. Encapsulated cells are typically achieved through the generation of controlled-size droplets from a liquid cell [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] which are then rapidly solidified or gelated to provide added stability. The stabilization may be achieved through a change in temperature or via material crosslinking.&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt; The microenvironment that a cell sees changes upon encapsulation. It typically goes from being on a [[monolayer]] to a suspension in a polymer scaffold within a polymeric membrane. A drawback of the technique is that encapsulating a cell decreases its viability and ability to proliferate and differentiate.&lt;ref&gt;In Wolff, J.A., (editor), Chang, M.T.S. et al (1994) Calcium phosphate-mediated DNA transfection. ''Gene Therapeutics'' Boston, Birkhauser Boston, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Further,  after some time within the microcapsule, cells form clusters that inhibit the exchange of oxygen and metabolic waste,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ponce|first=S|author2=Orive, G|author3=Gascón, AR|author4=Hernández, RM|author5=Pedraz, JL|title=Microcapsules prepared with different biomaterials to immobilize GDNF secreting 3T3 fibroblasts|journal=International journal of pharmaceutics|date=11 April 2005 |volume=293|issue=1–2|pages=1–10|pmid=15778039|doi=10.1016/j.ijpharm.2004.10.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to [[apoptosis]] and [[necrosis]] thus limiting the efficacy of the cells and activating the host's [[immune system]].
Artificial cells have been successful for transplanting a number of cells including [[islets of Langerhans]] for [[type 1 diabetes|diabetes]] treatment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kizilel|first=Seda|author2=Garfinkel, Marc|author3=Opara, Emmanuel|title=The Bioartificial Pancreas: Progress and Challenges|journal=Diabetes Technology &amp; Therapeutics|date=1 December 2005 |volume=7|issue=6|pages=968–985|doi=10.1089/dia.2005.7.968|pmid=16386103}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parathyroid chief cell|parathyroid cells]] and adrenal cortex cells.

Shortage of organ donors make artificial cells key players in alternative therapies for [[liver failure]]. The use of artificial cells for [[hepatocyte]] transplantation has demonstrated feasibility and efficacy in providing liver function in models of animal liver disease and [[bioartificial liver devices]].&lt;ref name=Dixit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixit|first=Vivek|author2=Gitnick, Gary|title=The bioartificial liver: state-of-the-art|journal=European Journal of Surgery|date=27 November 2003 |volume=164|issue=S12|pages=71–76|doi=10.1080/11024159850191481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research stemmed off experiments in which the hepatocytes were attached to the surface of a micro-carriers&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and has evolved into hepatocytes which are encapsulated in a three-dimensional matrix in [[alginate]] microdroplets covered by an outer skin of [[polylysine]]. A key advantage to this delivery method is the circumvention of [[immunosuppression]] therapy for the duration of the treatment. Hepatocyte encapsulations have been proposed for use in a [[bioartificial liver device|bioartifical liver]]. The device consists of a cylindrical chamber imbedded with isolated hepatocytes through which patient plasma is circulated extra-corporeally in a type of [[hemoperfusion]]. Because microcapsules have a high [[surface area]] to [[volume]] ratio, they provide large surface for substrate diffusion and can accommodate a large number of hepatocytes. Treatment to induced liver failure mice showed a significant increase in the rate of survival.&lt;ref name= 'Dixit' /&gt; Artificial liver systems are still in early development but show potential for patients waiting for [[organ transplant]] or while a patient's own liver regenerates sufficiently to resume normal function.

====Encapsulated bacterial cells====
The oral ingestion of live bacterial cell [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] has been proposed and is currently in therapy for the modulation of intestinal [[Flora (microbiology)|microflora]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mattila-Sandholm|first=T|title=Probiotics: towards demonstrating efficacy|journal=Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology|date=1 December 1999 |volume=10|issue=12|pages=393–399|doi=10.1016/S0924-2244(00)00029-7|last2=Blum|first2=S.|last3=Collins|first3=J.K.|last4=Crittenden|first4=R.|last5=De Vos|first5=W.|last6=Dunne|first6=C.|last7=Fondén|first7=R.|last8=Grenov|first8=G.|last9=Isolauri|first9=E.|last10=Kiely|first10=B.|last11=Marteau|first11=P.|last12=Morelli|first12=L.|last13=Ouwehand|first13=A.|last14=Reniero|first14=R.|last15=Saarela|first15=M.|last16=Salminen|first16=S.|last17=Saxelin|first17=M.|last18=Schiffrin|first18=E.|last19=Shanahan|first19=F.|last20=Vaughan|first20=E.|last21=von Wright|first21=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; prevention of [[diarrheal diseases]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=JS|author2=Bousvaros, A|author3=Lee, JW|author4=Diaz, A|author5=Davidson, EJ|title=Efficacy of probiotic use in acute diarrhea in children: a meta-analysis.|journal=Digestive Diseases and Sciences|date=November 2002 |volume=47|issue=11|pages=2625–34|pmid=12452406}}&lt;/ref&gt; treatment of [[Helicobacter pylori|''H.

The proposed mechanism of action is not fully understood but is believed to have two main effects. The first is the nutritional effect, in which the bacteria compete with toxin producing bacteria. The second is the sanitary effect, which stimulates resistance to colonization and stimulates [[immune response]].&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt;  The oral delivery of bacterial cultures is often a problem because they are targeted by the immune system and often destroyed when taken orally.

===Artificial blood cell===

====Oxygen carriers====
{{main|Haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers}}
Nano sized oxygen carriers are used as a type of [[red blood cell]] substitutes, although they lack other components of red blood cells. They are composed of a synthetic [[polymersome]] or an artificial membrane surrounding purified animal, human or recombinant [[hemoglobin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=HW|author2=Greenburg, AG|title=Artificial oxygen carriers as red blood cell substitutes: a selected review and current status.|journal=Artificial Organs|date=September 2004 |volume=28|issue=9|pages=813–28|pmid=15320945|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1594.2004.07345.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall, hemoglobin delivery continues to be a challenge because it is highly toxic when delivered without any modifications. In some clinical trials, vasopressor effects have been observed for first generation hemoglobin blood substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson 1998, Burhop and Estep 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

====Red blood cells====
Research interest in the use of artificial cells for blood arose after the [[AIDS]] scare of the 1980s. Besides bypassing the potential for disease transmission, artificial red blood cells are desired because they eliminate drawbacks associated with allogenic blood transfusions such as blood typing, immune reactions and its short storage life of 42 days. A [[hemoglobin]] substitute may be stored at room temperature and not under refrigeration for more than a year.&lt;ref name= 'Chang 2007' /&gt; Attempts have been made to develop a complete working red blood cell which comprises carbonic not only an oxygen carrier but also the enzymes associated with the cell. The first attempt was made in 1957 by replacing the red blood cell membrane by an ultrathin polymeric membrane&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=30th Anniversary in Artificial Red Blood Cell Research|journal=Artificial Cells, Blood Substitutes and Biotechnology|date=1 January 1988 |volume=16|issue=1–3|pages=1–9|doi=10.3109/10731198809132551}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by encapsulation through a [[lipid membrane]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Djordjevich|first=L|author2=Miller, IF|title=Synthetic erythrocytes from lipid encapsulated hemoglobin.|journal=Experimental hematology|date=May 1980 |volume=8|issue=5|pages=584–92|pmid=7461058}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and more recently a biodegradable polymeric membrane.&lt;ref name= 'Chang 2007' /&gt;
A biological red blood cell membrane including [[lipids]] and associated proteins can also be used to encapsulate nanoparticles and increase residence time in vivo by bypassing [[macrophage]] uptake and systemic clearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hu|first=CM|author2=Zhang, L|author3=Aryal, S|author4=Cheung, C|author5=Fang, RH|author6=Zhang, L|title=Erythrocyte membrane-camouflaged polymeric nanoparticles as a biomimetic delivery platform.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=5 July 2011 |volume=108|issue=27|pages=10980–5|pmid=21690347|doi=10.1073/pnas.1106634108|pmc=3131364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Leuko-polymersome====
A leuko-polymersome is a [[polymersome]] engineered to have the adhesive properties of a [[leukocyte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Daniel A.|author2=Robbins, Gregory P. |title=Leuko-polymersomes|journal=Faraday Discussions|date=1 January 2008 |volume=139|page=129|doi=10.1039/B717821B|last3=Haun|first3=Jered B.|last4=Lin|first4=John J.|last5=Qi|first5=Wei|last6=Smith|first6=Lee A.|last7=Peter Ghoroghchian|first7=P.|last8=Therien|first8=Michael J.|last9=Bates|first9=Frank S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polymersomes are vesicles composed of a bilayer sheet that can encapsulate many active molecules such as drugs or [[enzymes]]. By adding the adhesive properties of a leukocyte to their membranes, they can be made to slow down, or roll along epithelial walls within the quickly flowing [[circulatory system]].

==Synthetic cells==

===The minimal cell===
The German pathologist [[Rudolf Virchow]] brought forward the idea that not only does life arise from cells, but every cell comes from another cell;  "''Omnis cellula e cellula''".&lt;ref&gt;Virchow RLK (1858) Die cellularpathologie in ihrer begründung auf physiologische und pathologische gewebelehre (A. Hirschwald, Berlin) p xv&lt;/ref&gt; Until now, most attempts to create an artificial cell have only created a package that can mimic certain tasks of the cell. Advances in cell-free [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] reactions allow the expression of many [[genes]], but these efforts are far from producing a fully operational cell.

The future is in the creation of a [[protocell]], or a cell which has all the minimum requirements for life. Members from the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] have used a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] computational approach to knock out genes in a living organism to a minimum set of genes.&lt;ref name="gibson52"/&gt; In 2010, the team succeeded in creating a replicating strain of ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides]]'' ([[Mycoplasma laboratorium]]) using synthetically created DNA deemed to be the minimum requirement for life which was inserted into a genomically empty bacterium.&lt;ref name="gibson52"/&gt; It is hoped that the process of top-down biosynthesis will enable the insertion of new genes that would perform profitable functions such as generation of hydrogen for fuel or capturing excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name='Beadau'&gt;{{cite book| editor-last=Beadau| editor-first=Mark A.| title=The ethics of protocells moral and social implications of creating life in the laboratory| year=2009| publisher=MIT Press| location=Cambridge, Mass.| isbn=978-0-262-51269-5| edition=[Online-Ausg.] |author=Parke, Emily C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the myriad regulatory, metabolic, and signaling networks are not completely characterized. These [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] approaches have limitations for the understanding of fundamental molecular regulation, since the host organisms have a complex and incompletely defined molecular composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nanoporous Silica-Based Protocells at Multiple Scales for Designs of Life and Nanomedicine |journal=Life |year=2014 |last=Armstrong |first=Rachel |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=457–490 |doi=10.3390/life4030457 |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/4/3/457/htm |accessdate=2015-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] approach to build an artificial cell would involve creating a protocell ''de novo'', entirely from non-living materials. It is proposed to create a [[phospholipid bilayer]] vesicle with DNA capable of self-reproducing using synthetic genetic information. The three primary elements of such artificial cells are the formation of a [[lipid membrane]], [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] replication through a template process and the harvesting of chemical energy for [[active transport]] across the membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szostak|first=Jack W.|author2=Bartel, David P.|author3=Luisi, P. Luigi|title=Synthesizing life|journal=Nature|date=18 January 2001 |volume=409|issue=6818|pages=387–390|doi=10.1038/35053176|pmid=11201752}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pohorille|first=Andrew|author2=Deamer, David|title=Artificial cells: prospects for biotechnology|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|date=1 March 2002 |volume=20|issue=3|pages=123–128|doi=10.1016/S0167-7799(02)01909-1|pmid=11841864}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main hurdles foreseen and encountered with this proposed protocell are the creation of a minimal synthetic DNA that holds all sufficient information for life, and the reproduction of non-genetic components that are integral in cell development such as molecular self-organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noireaux|first=V|author2=Maeda, YT|author3=Libchaber, A|title=Development of an artificial cell, from self-organization to computation and self-reproduction.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=1 March 2011 |volume=108|issue=9|pages=3473–80|pmid=21317359|doi=10.1073/pnas.1017075108|pmc=3048108}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is hoped that this kind of bottom-up approach would provide insight into the fundamental questions of organizations at the cellular level and the origins of biological life. So far, no completely artificial cell capable of self-reproduction has been synthesized using the molecules of life, and this objective is still in a distant future although various groups are currently working towards this goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rasmussen|first=S|author2=Chen, L|author3=Nilsson, M|author4=Abe, S|title=Bridging nonliving and living matter.|journal=Artificial Life|date=Summer 2003 |volume=9|issue=3|pages=269–316|pmid=14556688|doi=10.1162/106454603322392479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method proposed to create a protocell more closely resembles the [[RNA world hypothesis|conditions]] believed to have been present during evolution known as the primordial soup. Various RNA polymers could be encapsulated in vesicles and in such small boundary conditions, chemical reactions would be tested for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Walter|title=Origin of life: The RNA world|journal=Nature|date=20 February 1986 |volume=319|issue=6055|pages=618–618|doi=10.1038/319618a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy investing in biology has been done by large companies such as [[ExxonMobil]], who has partnered with [[Synthetic Genomics|Synthetic Genomics Inc]]; Craig Venter's own biosynthetics company in the development of fuel from algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=C|title=Big oil bucks for algae.|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=September 2009 |volume=27|issue=9|page=783|pmid=19741613|doi=10.1038/nbt0909-783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic artificial cell===
The concept of an Electronic Artificial Cell has been expanded in a series of 3 EU projects coordinated by John McCaskill from 2004-2015.

The [[European Commission]] sponsored the development of the [http://www.istpace.org//index.html "Programmable Artificial Cell Evolution" (PACE)] program from 2004-2008 whose goal was to lay the foundation for the creation of "microscopic self-organizing, self-replicating, and evolvable autonomous entities built from simple organic and inorganic substances that can be genetically programmed to perform specific functions"&lt;ref&gt;PACE report&lt;/ref&gt; for the eventual integration into information systems. The PACE project developed the first Omega Machine, a microfluidic life support system for artificial cells that could complement chemically missing functionalities (as originally proposed by Norman Packard, Steen Rasmussen, Mark Beadau and John McCaskill). The ultimate aim was to attain an evolvable hybrid cell in a complex microscale programmable environment. The functions of the Omega Machine could then be removed stepwise, posing a series of solvable evolution challenges to the artificial cell chemistry. The project achieved chemical integration up to the level of pairs of the three core functions of artificial cells (a genetic subsystem, a containment system and a metabolic system), and generated novel spatially resolved programmable microfluidic environments for the integration of containment and genetic amplification.[http://www.istpace.org//index.html "Programmable Artificial Cell Evolution" (PACE)]  The project led to the creation of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111214010917/http://www.ecltech.org/ecltech_j/] European center for living technology] which is now continuing similar research.

Following this research, in 2007, John McCaskill proposed to concentrate on an electronically complemented artificial cell, called the '''Electronic Chemical Cell'''. The key idea was to use a massively parallel array of electrodes coupled to locally dedicated electronic circuitry, in a two-dimensional thin film, to complement emerging chemical cellular functionality. Local electronic information defining the electrode switching and sensing circuits could serve as an electronic genome, complementing the molecular sequential information in the emerging protocols. A research proposal was successful with the [[European Commission]] and an international team of scientists partially overlapping with the PACE consortium commenced work 2008-2012 on the project Electronic Chemical Cells. The project demonstrated among other things that electronically controlled local transport of specific sequences could be used as an artificial spatial control system for the genetic proliferation of future artificial cells, and that core processes of metabolism could be delivered by suitably coated electrode arrays.

The major limitation of this approach, apart from the initial difficulties in mastering microscale electrochemistry and electrokinetics, is that the electronic system is interconnected as a rigid non-autonomous piece of macroscopic hardware. In 2011, McCaskill proposed to invert the geometry of electronics and chemistry : instead of placing chemicals in an active electronic medium, to place microscopic autonomous electronics in a chemical medium. He organized a project to tackle a third generation of Electronic Artificial Cells at the 100&amp;nbsp;µm scale that could self-assemble from two half-cells "lablets" to enclose an internal chemical space, and function with the aid of active electronics powered by the medium they are immersed in. Such cells can copy both their electronic and chemical contents and will be capable of evolution within the constraints provided by their special pre-synthesized microscopic building blocks. In Sep 2012 work commenced on this project [http://www.MICREAgents.eu/ Microscale Chemically Reactive Electronic Agents].

===Ethics and controversy===
Protocell research has created controversy and opposing opinions, including critics of the vague definition of "artificial life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Life after the synthetic cell|journal=Nature|date=27 May 2010 |volume=465|issue=7297|pages=422–424|doi=10.1038/465422a|pmid=20495545|author1=Bedau|first1=M|last2=Church|first2=G|last3=Rasmussen|first3=S|last4=Caplan|first4=A|last5=Benner|first5=S|last6=Fussenegger|first6=M|last7=Collins|first7=J|last8=Deamer|first8=D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creation of a basic unit of life is the most pressing ethical concern, although the most widespread worry about protocells is their potential threat to human health and the environment through uncontrolled replication.&lt;ref name='Beadau'/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2974">[[File:American35.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An [[excavator]] working in a borrow pit.]]
In [[construction]] and [[civil engineering]], a '''borrow pit''', also known as a sand box, is an area where material (usually [[soil]], [[gravel]] or [[sand]]) has been dug for use at another location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandandgravel.com/news/article.asp?v1=8160 Design of a monitoring protocol/plan for sand borrow areas, Dredging News Online, 7 January 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Borrow pits can be found close to many major construction projects. For example, soil might be excavated to [[Fill dirt|fill]] an embankment for a [[highway]], [[clay]] might be excavated for use in [[brick]]-making, gravel to be used for making [[concrete]], etc.

In some cases, the borrow pits may become filled with [[ground water]], forming [[recreation]]al areas or sustainable [[wildlife]] [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s (one such example is the Merton Borrow Pit, near [[Oxford]] in central [[England]], excavated to provide materials for the nearby [[M40 motorway]]). In other cases, borrow pits may be used for [[landfill]] and [[waste disposal]].

A regional variation of this is termed "'''barrow pit'''" in the western United States (especially the Rocky Mountains). The localism—sometimes pronounced "borrer pit"—describes the ditch along a roadway. These ditches were created to provide the fill to level and crown the roadway and subsequently provided drainage for the road.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Frederic Gomes, and Joan Houston Hall (eds). (2002) ''Dictionary of American Regional English''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''excavation lake''' (also a '''flooded gravel pit''') is an artificial [[lake]], which usually has its origins in the excavation of [[gravel]] or [[sand]] for construction materials or in some other kind of [[surface mining]]. In many cases, the excavation holes are landscaped according to the [[land restoration]] required by law. Because the excavation reached a point below the [[water table]], lakes form naturally. Less frequently excavation lakes are intentionally created, especially as [[recreation area]]s.

In Germany the lakes are almost always used for fishing, since a fishery is created by law with every surface water. At some excavation lakes, beaches are added for swimming or other [[water sports]], in particular boating, water skiing or windsurfing. To support these uses, large parking lots, changing areas, and eating areas are also set up. In some cases, the excavation lake serves as a nature reserve, as in the case of the lakes in the [[Attenborough Nature Reserve]].

The '''Buffalo Players''' were a [[community theater]] group operating in [[Buffalo, NY]] from 1922 to 1926. Although only in operation for four years, they were connected with several prominent theater and film professionals, such as [[Franchot Tone|C. Pascal Franchot]] (later known as film actor Franchot Tone); [[Marian de Forest]], founder of Zonta International and Buffalo civic leader;&lt;ref name="zonta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zonta.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=r8KcSrQ80UY%3D&amp;tabid=63|title=www.zonta.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=r8KcSrQ80UY%3D&amp;tabid=63|publisher=zonta.org|accessdate=2014-04-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909190856/http://zonta.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=r8KcSrQ80UY%3D&amp;tabid=63|archivedate=2013-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Broadway and Hollywood actor Jerome Collamore.

They were also in part the inspiration for two other community theater groups, the Niagara Falls Little Theater (Now Niagara Regional Theatre Guild), which was founded in 1924, and the [[Rochester Community Players]], continuously operating since 1925. Founding members also assisted in the launch of the Studio Theater School, predecessor of Buffalo's [[Studio Arena Theater]].

==Organization==
Marian de Forest was the president of the organization. She continued as a theater critic for the Buffalo Express even while serving as the head of the Buffalo Players.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. her column, "As Go the Play", Buffalo Express, June 22, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; At a speech before the newly-forming Niagara Falls Players Association on November 6, 1924, she described how, in the early days of the Buffalo organization, they only had 'hope and faith', and 'depended on charity.'&lt;ref name=NFG2-7-24&gt;Niagara Falls Gazette, February 7, 1924, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; She said they started looking for a suitable place two years earlier, examining barns, a brewery and churches, before coming on what she described as a "forlorn" Allendale theater, with aisle too narrow, seats too close together and decorations in very poor condition, and that by 1924 the theater was in 'fine style'.&lt;ref name=NFG2-7-24/&gt;

The offices and rehearsal space of the Players was in an historic house at 334 Delaware Avenue, built in the 1860s and leased from the owner, Dr. Charles Cary.&lt;ref&gt;"Players Housed in One of City's Storied Abodes"; Buffalo Morning Express, August 16, 1925&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Morning Express March 25, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; The house was located between the Cary home at 340 Delaware, and the home of Lawrence D. Rumsey at 330 Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Express, December 15, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1920 United States Census&lt;/ref&gt;

Lars S. Potter was Vice President of the organization&lt;ref name=BE7-14-25&gt;Buffalo Morning Express June 24, 1925&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Franchot Tone|Pascal Franchot]] was secretary of the new organization, and a forceful speaker on its behalf.&lt;ref name=BME10-7-24&gt;Buffalo Morning Press, October 7, 1924&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was publicly launched at a meeting at the Iroquois Hotel, Buffalo November 23, 1922, with Walter Hampden as the guest speaker  and Buffalo Players President de Forest presiding.&lt;ref name=BE11-21-22&gt;Buffalo Express, November 21, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

The Players leased the Allendale Theater, starting January 1923 with an 18-month lease.&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Express, December 26, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buffalospree"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalospree.com/buffalospreemagazine/archives/2003_10/1003theaters.html|title=Buffalo Spree Magazine|publisher=buffalospree.com|accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buffalo Players had reached membership of 2,560 by the opening of the 1924-25 season, according to Pascal Franchot.&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Morning Express, Nov. 24, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; Going into the 1925-26 season, the Buffalo Players had a membership of nearly 2,600.&lt;ref name=BE7-24-25&gt;Buffalo Express, July 24, 1925&lt;/ref&gt;
In the summer of 1925, the Buffalo Players started putting out a newsletter called ''The Cue'', and adopted a 'seal' or logo designed by Urquhart Wilcox: the skull of a buffalo inside a triangle.&lt;ref name=BE7-24-25/&gt;

==Managing Directors==

Frederick Kitson Cowley was the first 'Art Director' (artistic or managing director) of the Buffalo Players.&lt;ref name=BE11-21-22/&gt; Cowley had attended the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. He was an illustrator who had taught at the [[University of Illinois]], the [[University of Minnesota]] and the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]]. He had fifteen years of experience prior to coming to the Buffalo Players, and had directed soldoers' plays in France and Italy as part of the World War I [[American Expeditionary Force]].&lt;ref name =BE11-24-24&gt;Buffalo Express, November 24, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; At the organization's first public meeting, Crowley stated that the theater was at its highest development in the age of [[William Shakespeare]], [[Richard Burbage]], and [[Edward Alleyn]], and that contemporary theater was over-commercialized and controlled by people not primarily interested in theater as an art. The purpose of groups like the Buffalo Players was to foster a love for theater of artistic value. "Our community theater will be to all intents in the hands of the actors. It is better to have freedom of motion in the theaters with amateurs thaan to have ever-so-capable actors dominated by those who know little and care less for the art of the stage."&lt;ref name =BE11-24-24/&gt;

Eric Seton Snowden, of California, was engaged as the director of the Buffalo Players in July, 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Address of Henry W, Hill, President of the Buffalo Historical Society. January 8, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden believed in popular entertainment. "I am extremely weary of uplifting drama. It simply isn't being done anymore, either. Out in Pasadina [the [[Pasadena Playhouse]], California], where I spent part of the summer, the Community theater there had achieved a howling success with such offerings as [[Potash and Perlmutter]]. The little theaterite is finding out that he can't take himself too seriously, or he will be laughed out of court. The community theater, if it is to continue to function.. . must take off its high heeled boots and tread like folks. The high brow ideal that use to be obtained doesn't mix with box office receipts, and for an unsubsidized theater such as we have here at the present time, the latter has just got to be considered. The primary objective of any theater, for that matter, is to entertain; and nothing that is deadly dull, as uplift productions mostly are, can either function or endure."&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Morning Express, September 14, 1924, pg 8, "Strolling on the Avenue" column&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadway and Hollywood actor Jerome Collamore was named to succeed Mr. Snowden in August 1925.&lt;ref name=BE7-24-25/&gt;&lt;ref name=BE8-13-25&gt;Buffalo Morning Express August 13, 1925&lt;/ref&gt; In a newspaper interview, he stated that "the drama is the greatest force of good there is. . . it is better than the pulpet, since the play is that medium of education which appeals to the emotions." In speaking of the Buffalo Players, and community theater in general, "Yours is a splendid spirit, since you are feeling out constantly for new talent, new material. Therein lies your opportunity. You can do the unusual. You are not limited to the things to which the commercial theater is limited. The true spirit in a community theater is that which allows for growth, which visualizes the future of American drama."&lt;ref name=BE8-13-25/&gt; Mr. Collamore was released at the end of the 1925-26 season.&lt;ref name=TheaterGuild&gt;"Players Group Launches New Theater Guild", newspaper clipping (unknown newspaper) 1924–1927 Scrapbook of the Rochester Community Players, in the Local History department of the Rochester Public Library&lt;/ref&gt;

The final professional director of the Buffalo Players, for the 1926-27 season, was Harold P. Preston. He stated that "The Buffalo Players will, this season, produce only plays which we believe significant. But this does not mean that our productions will be uninteresting. Quite the contrary. There is an 'all too general impression that art, and especially dramatic art, is stodgy dull, tragic. Nothing is farther from the truth. Some of the merriest of plays are artistic. Most significant plays are interesting, not alone for the problem they may solve or present, but likewise because they aie well written, dramatic plays. The Buffalo Players will not, however, make even a slight obeisance in the direction of the box office. We will be only too happy to have large audiences. But we want audiences who come to us because the wish to see the fine things of the theatre, done with sincerity and understanding. We want audiences who want the sort of plays and productions which will make Buffalo take its place among the cities of the United States interested in, and fostering, the worth while in dramatic art."&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Arts Journal, Vo. VIII, No. 11, November 1926, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of Operations==

Dissension over the direction of the program reached the newspapers in April 1926.  [[Jessie Bonstelle]], a former Buffalo stock producer and actress, had been quoted as saying, in regard to little theaters, "these groups invariably become cliques and snobbishness develops, offsetting whatever possibilities the Little Theater might have for good." In response, Sibylla Schiling, a cast member in the production of ''The Climax'', replied "The Little Theater movement tends, particularly in the stance of the Buffalo Players where everyone who is interested may come in and take part, to discourage snobbishness."&lt;ref name=BE4-11-26/&gt;

In the Spring of 1926, a competing community theater organization first presented a production in Buffalo, the Volday Players.&lt;ref name=BMP5-5-26&gt;Buffalo Morning Express; May 5, 1926&lt;/ref&gt; According to a newspaper account, "the members of the cast are. . . familiar to Buffaloians through their appearance in Buffalo Players' performances."&lt;ref name=BMP5-5-26/&gt;

At the conclusion of the 1925-26 season, the group apparently intended to change their production policy, from being a 'community theater' emphasizing popular theatrical fare, to a '[[Little Theatre Movement|Little Theater]]', concentrating on more artistic production.&lt;ref name=BE6-13-26&gt;Buffalo Express, June 13, 1926, "Strolling on the Avenue" column&lt;/ref&gt; According to one newspaper analysis, being a 'little theater' was the original idea of the group, and they were considering relocation to "a pleasant old barn", which would be turned into an intimate 300 seat theater.&lt;ref name=BE6-13-26/&gt;

People associated with the Volday Players filed incorporation papers for the Buffalo Little Theater Guild, Inc. in the summer or fall of 1926.&lt;ref name=TheaterGuild/&gt; A newspaper report characterized the move as "a definite split in the ranks of the Buffalo Players" and listed supporters of the new Guild as including Howard L. Volgeneau (President of the new group), George H. Richardson, Julius H. Potter, Kevin O'Callahan, and Myron C. Dulvany.&lt;ref name=TheaterGuild/&gt; The newspaper report stated that Lars S. Potter and the Buffalo Players was surprised by the incorporation, but that it would have no effect on the plans for their upcoming season.&lt;ref name=TheaterGuild/&gt; The report described those plans as following: "The Buffalo Players at the present time are raising funds for the acquisition of a theater of their own in which to produce their plays. Up until last spring the Playhouse in Allen Street was leased to them, but with the close of the 1925-26 season the Playhouse was turned back to its owners, who have reestablished it as a motion picture house. Jerome Collamore, producing director of the Buffalo Players, was released with the presentation of the final play, ''The Thief''. Since then various rumors with respect to the directorship plans have been afloat."&lt;ref name=TheaterGuild/&gt;

In the summer of 1926, the Buffalo Players had a decision to make: whether to continue as a community theater program, with popular entertainment at a large playhouse and the need to raise $40,000 per year, or to convert to a strict "[[Little Theatre Movement|Little Theater]]", with a small performance space, concentrating on productions perceived to be of artistic merit, and avowedly with no concern for box office receipts.&lt;ref&gt;Community or Little Theatre -- Which?, analysis of Buffalo Players by Lee F. Heacock, Buffalo Arts Journal, Vol. VIII, June, July, August 1926, pg. 43&lt;/ref&gt; As shown by the quote from Mr. Preston, cited above, the Buffalo Players chose to go the Little Theater route.

A year later, in the Summer of 1927, the Buffalo Players operation, including its assets, performance space and "good-will", was merged into the Studio School of the Theater, operated by Jane Keeler and Sheldon Viele.&lt;ref&gt;"The New School of the Theater"", Buffalo Arts Journal, September 1927, pg. 421 (note page numbering starts with the first issue of the year)&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered the origins of the Studio Arena Theater (see: [[Studio Arena Theater]]). A letter was sent by the officers of the Buffalo Players to the membership in July, 1927, announcing this merger.&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Courier-Express July 24, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Performances and classes for the Studio School were held in the Buffalo Players former space on the corner of Elmwood Avenue and Anderson Place.&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Courier-Express Magazine, September 22, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Keeler directed the Studio Theater School until 1958, and died in 1974 at age 94.&lt;ref&gt;Tonawanda, NY, News February 11, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration to other theaters==

===Niagara Little Theater===

Marian de Forest, as president of the Buffalo Players, wrote to 'leading citizens' of Niagara Falls in early 1924, inviting them to an organizational meeting of he Niagara Falls Little Theater, a community theater organization, on February 6 at the Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name=NFG2-15-29&gt;"Players of Niagara Established after 5&amp;nbsp;Years"; Niagara Falls Gazette, February 15, 1929, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The invitation stated "the proposed organization will be patterned after the Players association of Buffalo and similar institutions in other cities..." Ms. de Forest spoke on the history and experience of the Buffalo Players at the meeting (this is the meeting described in "organization", above).&lt;ref name=NFG2-7-24/&gt;&lt;ref name=NFG2-15-29/&gt;
Niagara Falls launched its program with a production of ''[[Wedding Bells (play)|Wedding Bells]]'', by [[Salisbury Field]], in May 1924. The director of the play was Fred Kitson Cowley, the first director of the Buffalo Players.&lt;ref name =BE4-20-24&gt;Buffalo Express April 20, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley remained director of the group until 1927 &lt;ref name=NFG2-15-29/&gt; The chairman of the new organization was Edward ("Ned") Franchot, cousin of Pascal Franchot, founding member of the Buffalo Players.&lt;ref name=BE4-20-24/&gt; Edward Franchot was a member of the cast of the first Buffalo Players production, ''The Curious Mishap''.&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Express, December 3, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rochester Community Players===

The first organizational luncheon of the Rochester Community Players was held at the Sagamore Hotel, Rochester NY, in October 1923, and Pascal Franchot, representing the Buffalo Players, was the principal speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Newspaper clippings located in the 1924–1927 Scrapbook of the Rochester Community Players, in the Local History department of the Rochester Public Library&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1924, the Buffalo Players took their production of ''Fashion'' to [[Rochester, NY]] as an example to the newly formed Rochester Community Players as to what a community theater was capable of producing.&lt;ref&gt;"Community Theater Here to Bring Buffalo Cast Tomorrow in Popular Old Play", Rochester NY newspaper clipping dated December 21, 1924, located in the 1924–1927 Scrapbook of the Rochester Community Players, in the Local History department of the Rochester Public Library&lt;/ref&gt; The Rochester organization commenced its own program January 19, 1925 with a production ''Wedding Bells'', by Salisbury Field (the same play that opened the Niagara Falls program eight months earlier.)

'''Buuz''' ({{lang-mn|Бууз}}; {{langWithName|bxr-Cyrl|Buryat|Бууза}}, ''buuza'', {{IPA-mn|ˈbʊːt͡s(ɐ)|}}) is a type of Mongolian [[Steaming|steamed]] [[dumpling]] filled with meat. An example of authentic [[Mongolian cuisine|Mongolian]] and [[Buryats|Buryatian]] cuisine, the dish is traditionally eaten at home on [[Tsagaan Sar]], the Mongolian New Year. These days it is also offered at restaurants and small cafes throughout the capital of [[Ulaanbaatar]].&lt;ref name="Slater2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Slater|first=Judith J.|title=Teen Life in Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Oz5cvi3z3EC&amp;pg=PA118|accessdate=10 February 2013|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=9780313315329|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and function==
Buuz is the Mongolian version of the steamed dumpling which is found throughout the region. Etymologically, it reveals its origin to [[China]], as ''[[baozi]]''  ({{zh|c=包子|p={{Audio|Zh-bāozi.oga|bāozi|help=no}}}}) is the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] word for steamed dumpling. They are eaten in great quantities throughout the year but especially during the Mongolian New Year celebrations, which usually fall in February. ''Buuz'' are prepared in the weeks before and left outside to freeze; they are consumed with salads and fried bread, accompanied by ''[[suutei tsai]]'' (Mongolian tea) and [[vodka]].&lt;ref name="Williams2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Sean|title=The Ethnomusicologists' Cookbook: Complete Meals from Around the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1R6xigawTekC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=10 February 2013|year=2006|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780415978194|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buuz are filled with minced [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]] or [[beef]], which is flavoured with onion and/or garlic and salted. Occasionally, they are flavoured with sprouted fennel seeds and other seasonal herbs. Mashed potato, cabbage, or rice may be added as well.

The meat ball is then placed inside a small pocket of dough which is folded around the ball with a small opening at the top and in the chef's own personal style. The buuz is then steamed and eaten by hand, with the dough pocket catching the juices of the meat.

Buuz are similar to another Mongolian dumpling, [[khuushuur]], except that the latter is fried.

''The Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', p. 105-106. {{ISBN|0-674-00084-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A harmonic cadence is a [[chord progression|progression]] of (at least) two [[chord (music)|chord]]s that [[conclusion (music)|concludes]] a [[phrase (music)|phrase]], [[section (music)|section]], or [[composition (music)|piece]] of [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003).

A cadence is labeled more or less "weak" or "strong" depending on its sense of finality. While cadences are usually classified by specific chord or [[melodic]] progressions, the use of such progressions does not necessarily constitute a cadence—there must be a sense of closure, as at the end of a phrase. [[Harmonic rhythm]] plays an important part in determining where a cadence occurs.

Cadences are strong indicators of the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] or central pitch of a passage or piece.&lt;ref name="Randel"/&gt; [[Edward Lowinsky]] proposed that the cadence was the "cradle of [[tonality]]".&lt;ref&gt;Judd, Cristle Collins (1998). "Introduction: Analyzing Early Music", ''Tonal Structures of Early Music'', {{Page needed|date=May 2010}}. (ed. Judd). New York: Garland Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8153-2388-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common classifications==
In music of the [[common practice period]], cadences are divided into four main types, according to their harmonic progression: ''authentic'' (typically ''perfect authentic'' or ''imperfect authentic''), ''half'', ''plagal'', and ''deceptive''. Typically, phrases end on authentic or half cadences, and the terms ''plagal'' and ''deceptive'' refer to motion that avoids or follows a phrase-ending cadence. Each cadence can be described using the [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numeral system]] of naming [[chord (music)|chords]].

===Authentic cadence===&lt;!--[[Perfect authentic cadence]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
An authentic cadence is a cadence from [[Dominant (music)|V]] to [[root (chord)|I]] (or [[I–IV–V–I|V–I]]). A seventh above the root is often added to create [[Dominant seventh chord|V&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;]], and the V is often preceded by a [[Cadential six-four|cadential {{music|64 chord}} chord]]. ''The Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' says, "This cadence is a microcosm of the tonal system, and is the most direct means of establishing a pitch as tonic. It is virtually obligatory as the final structural cadence of a tonal work."&lt;ref name="Randel"/&gt; Authentic cadences are generally classified as either ''perfect'' or ''imperfect''. The phrase ''perfect cadence'' is sometimes used as a synonym for ''authentic cadence'' but can also have a more precise meaning depending on the chord [[voicing (music)|voicing]].

There are three distinct types of imperfect authentic cadences (IAC):
*''Root position IAC'' (shown below): Similar to a perfect authentic cadence, but the highest voice is not the tonic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}
*''Inverted IAC'': Similar to a perfect authentic cadence, but one or both chords is [[Inverted chord|inverted]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

*''Leading tone IAC'': The V chord is replaced with the vii&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;/[[tritone substitution|subV]] chord (but the cadence still ends on I).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

====Evaded cadence====

An evaded cadence goes from V{{su|b=2|p=4}} to I{{su|p=6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Darcy and Hepokoski (2006). ''Elements of Sonata Theory: Norms, Types, and Deformations in the Late-Eighteenth-Century Sonata'', p.. {{ISBN|0-19-514640-9}}. "the unexpected motion of a cadential dominant chord to a I&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; (instead of the normatively cadential I)"&lt;/ref&gt; Because the seventh must fall step wise, it forces the cadence to resolve to the less stable [[first inversion]] chord. To achieve this, a root position V usually changes to a V{{su|b=2|p=4}} right before resolution, thereby "evading" the cadence. (See also [[Cadence (music)#Inverted cadence|inverted cadence]] below.)

===Half cadence===
&lt;!--[[Half cadence]], [[Half-cadence]] and [[semicadence]] redirect directly here--&gt;A half cadence (also called an ''imperfect cadence'' or ''semicadence'') is any cadence ending on V, whether preceded by II (V of V), ii, vi, IV, or I—or any other chord. Because it sounds incomplete or suspended, the half cadence is considered a weak cadence that calls for continuation.&lt;ref name="Jonas" /&gt;&lt;!--citation refers to semicadence--&gt;

Due to its being a survival from modal Renaissance harmony this cadence gives an archaic sound, especially when preceded by v (v–iv&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;–V).&lt;ref&gt;Finn Egeland Hansen (2006).

====Lydian cadence====
A [[Lydian cadence]] is similar to the Phrygian half cadence, involving iv&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;–V in the minor. The difference is that in the Lydian cadence, the whole iv&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; is raised by a [[half step]]. In other words, the Phrygian half cadence begins with the first chord built on [[Degree (music)|scale degree]] {{music|scale|4}}, while the Lydian half cadence is built on the scale degree {{music|sharp}}{{music|scale|4}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Like an authentic cadence (V–I), the plagal half cadence involves a descending fifth (or, by [[Inverted chord|inversion]], an ascending fourth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Daniel|title=Harmonic Function in Chromatic Music: A Renewed Dualist Theory and an Account of Its Precedents|date=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226318087|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_SyNx1vr-AkC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plagal half cadence is a weak cadence, ordinarily at the ending of an [[Antecedent (music)|antecedent]] phrase, after which a [[Consequent (music)|consequent]] phrase commences. One example of this use is in "[[Auld Lang Syne]]". But in one very unusual occurrence – the end of the [[exposition (music)|exposition]] of the first movement of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]' [[Clarinet Trio (Brahms)|Clarinet Trio, Op. 114]]—it is used to complete not just a musical phrase but an entire section of a movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Notley|first1=Margaret|title=Plagal Harmony as Other: Asymmetrical Dualism and Instrumental Music by Brahms|journal=The Journal of Musicology|date=2005|volume=22|issue=1|pages=114–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plagal cadence is a cadence from IV to I. It is also known as the ''[[Amen]] cadence'' because of its frequent setting to the text "Amen" in [[hymns]].

[[William Caplin]] disputes the existence of plagal cadences in music of the classical era:

{{quote|An examination of the classical repertory reveals that such a cadence rarely exists. ... Inasmuch as the progression IV–I cannot confirm a tonality (it lacks any leading-tone resolution), it cannot articulate formal closure .... Rather, this progression is normally part of a tonic prolongation serving a variety of formal functions – not, however a cadential one.  Most examples of plagal cadences given in textbooks actually represent a postcadential codetta function: that is, the IV–I progression follows an authentic cadence but does not itself create genuine cadential closure."&lt;ref&gt;

It may be noticed that the plagal cadence, "leaves open the possibility of interpretation as V–I–V" rather than I–IV–I.&lt;ref name="Jonas"&gt;[[Oswald Jonas|Jonas, Oswald]] (1982). ''Introduction to the Theory of Heinrich Schenker'' (1934: ''Das Wesen des musikalischen Kunstwerks: Eine Einführung in Die Lehre Heinrich Schenkers''), p. 24. Trans. John Rothgeb. {{ISBN|0-582-28227-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "minor plagal cadence" is used to refer to the iv–I progression. Sometimes a combination of major and minor plagal cadence is used (IV–iv–I)

At the beginning of the final movement of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|9th Symphony]], the listener hears a string of many deceptive cadences progressing from V to IV&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

One of the most striking uses of this cadence is in the A-minor section at the end of the exposition in the first movement of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]' [[Symphony No. 3 (Brahms)|Third Symphony]]. The music progresses to an implied E minor dominant (B&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) with a rapid chromatic scale upwards but suddenly sidesteps to C major. The same device is used again in the recapitulation; this time the sidestep is—as one would expect—to F major, the tonic key of the whole Symphony.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The interrupted cadence is also frequently used in popular music. For example, the [[Pink Floyd]] song "[[Bring the Boys Back Home]]" ends with such a cadence (at approximately 0:45–50).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== Other classifications ==

===Inverted cadence===
An inverted cadence (also called a ''medial cadence'') [[Inverted chord|inverts]] the last chord. It may be restricted only to the perfect and imperfect cadence, or only to the perfect cadence, or it may apply to cadences of all types.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Michael, ed. (2004). ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p.116. {{ISBN|0-19-860884-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To distinguish them from this form, the other, more common forms of cadences listed above are known as ''radical cadences''.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezp2.lib.umn.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/18241 Medial cadence]". Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 23 Jul. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Rhythmic classifications===

Cadences can also be classified by their rhythmic position:

* A metrically accented cadence occurs on a strong position, typically the downbeat of a [[bar (music)|measure]].
* A metrically unaccented cadence occurs in a metrically weak position, for instance, after a long [[appoggiatura]].

Metrically accented cadences are considered stronger and are generally of greater structural significance. In the past, the terms ''masculine'' and ''feminine'' were sometimes used to describe rhythmically "strong" or "weak" cadences, but this terminology is no longer acceptable to some.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Picardy third===
A [[Picardy third]] (or Picardy cadence) is a harmonic device that originated in Western music in the Renaissance era. It refers to the use of a major chord of the tonic at the end of a musical section that is either modal or in a minor key. The example below shows a picardy third in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s ''[[Jesu, meine Freude, BWV 227|Jesu, meine Freude]]'' (Jesus, My Joy), mm. 12–13.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Benward and Marilyn Nadine Saker, ''Music in Theory and Practice: Volume II'', eighth edition (Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2009), p.&amp;nbsp;74. {{ISBN|978-0-07-310188-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upper leading-tone cadence===
The example below shows a cadence featuring an [[Upper leading tone|upper leading-tone]] from a well-known 16th-century lamentation, the debate over which was documented in Rome c.1540.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Karol (1987). ''Musica Ficta: Theories of Accidental Inflections in Vocal Polyphony from Marchetto da Padova to Gioseffo Zarlino'', p. 148. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-54338-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The final three written notes in the upper voice are B–C–D, in which case a [[trill (music)|trill]] on C produces D. However, convention implied a C{{music|sharp}}, and a [[cadential trill]] of a [[whole tone]] on the second to last note produces D{{music|sharp}}/E{{music|flat}}, the upper leading-tone of D{{music|natural}}. Presumably, the debate was over whether to use C{{music|sharp}}–D{{music|sharp}} or C{{music|sharp}}–D for the trill.

==In medieval and Renaissance polyphony==
[[Medieval music|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] cadences are based upon [[dyad (music)|dyads]] rather than chords. The first theoretical mention of cadences comes from [[Guido of Arezzo]]'s description of the ''occursus'' in his [[Micrologus]], where he uses the term to mean where the two lines of a two-part [[polyphony|polyphonic]] phrase end in a [[unison]].

According to [[Carl Dahlhaus]], "as late as the 13th century the [[half step]] was experienced as a problematic interval not easily understood, as the remainder between the [[perfect fourth]] and the [[ditone]]:&lt;ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac43}{\left(\frac98\right)^2} = \frac{256}{243}&lt;/math&gt;
In a melodic half step, listeners of the time perceived no tendency of the lower tone toward the upper, or the upper toward the lower. The second tone was not the 'goal' of the first. Instead, musicians avoided the half step in clausulas because, to their ears, it lacked clarity as an interval. Beginning in the 13th century cadences begin to require motion in one voice by half step and the other a [[whole step]] in contrary motion.

=== Plagal cadence ===
A plagal cadence was found occasionally as an interior cadence, with the lower voice in two-part writing moving up a perfect fifth or down a perfect fourth.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S 14"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2009), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/score&gt;

=== Pause ===
A [[rest (music)|pause]] in one voice may also be used as a weak interior cadence.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S 14" /&gt; The example below, Lassus's ''[[Qui vult venire post me]]'', mm. 3–5, shows a pause in the third measure.

&lt;/score&gt;

=== Evaded cadence ===
In [[counterpoint]], an evaded cadence is one where one of the voices in a [[suspension (music)|suspension]] does not resolve as expected, and the voices together resolved to a consonance other than an octave or unison&lt;ref&gt;Schubert, Peter (1999). ''Modal Counterpoint, Renaissance Style'', p.132. {{ISBN|0-19-510912-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (a perfect fifth, a sixth, or a third).

=== Corelli cadence ===
The [[Corelli cadence]], or Corelli clash, named for its association with the [[violin]] music of the [[Corelli school]], is a cadence characterized by a [[Major second|major]] and/or [[minor second]] clash between the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] and the [[leading-tone]] or the tonic and [[supertonic]]. An example is shown below.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Latham, Alison, ed. (2002). ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', p.192. {{ISBN|0-19-866212-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

             }
         &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

=== English cadence ===
Another "clash cadence", the [[English cadence]], is a [[contrapuntal]] pattern particular to the authentic or perfect cadence. It features the [[Blue note|blue seventh]] against the [[dominant chord]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|van der Merwe, Peter]] (2005). ''Roots of the Classical: The Popular Origins of Western Music'', p.492. {{ISBN|0-19-816647-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, which in the [[Key (music)|key]] of C would be '''B{{music|flat}}''' and G–'''B{{music|natural}}'''–D. Popular with English composers of the [[High Renaissance]] and [[English Restoration|Restoration]] periods in the 16th and 17th centuries, the English cadence is described as archaic&lt;ref&gt;Carver, Anthony (1988). ''The Development of Sacred Polychoral Music to the Time of Schütz'', p.136. {{ISBN|0-521-30398-2}}. If the clash cadence is already, "archaic, [and/or] mannered," in the music of [[Heinrich Schütz]] (1585-1672) it must surely be so now.&lt;/ref&gt; or old-fashioned&lt;ref&gt;Herissone, Rebecca (2001). ''Music Theory in Seventeenth-Century England'', p.170. {{ISBN|0-19-816700-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; sounding. It was first given its name in the 20th century. 

The hallmark of this device is the [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] [[augmented octave]] (compound [[augmented unison]]) produced by a [[false relation]] between the split seventh [[Degree (music)|scale degree]], as shown below in an excerpt from ''[[O sacrum convivium]]'' by [[Thomas Tallis]]. The [[courtesy accidental]] on the tenor's G{{music|natural}} is editorial.

=== Landini cadence ===
A [[Landini cadence]] (also known as a ''Landini sixth'', ''Landini sixth cadence'', or ''under-third cadence''&lt;ref name="Merwe"&gt;[[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|van der Merwe, Peter]] (2005). ''Roots of the Classical: The Popular Origins of Western Music'', p.501. {{ISBN|0-19-816647-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a cadence that was used extensively in the 14th and early 15th century. It is named after [[Francesco Landini]], a composer who used them prodigiously. Similar to a clausula vera, it includes an [[Nonchord tone|escape tone]] in the upper voice, which briefly narrows the interval to a [[perfect fifth]] before the octave.

    &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; }
&lt;/score&gt;

==Classical cadential trill==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
In the [[Classical music era|Classical period]], composers often drew out the authentic cadences at the ends of sections; the cadence's dominant chord might take up a measure or two, especially if it contained the resolution of a [[Nonchord tone#Suspension|suspension]] remaining from the chord preceding the dominant. During these two measures, the solo instrument (in a [[concerto]]) often played a [[trill (music)|trill]] on the [[supertonic]] (the fifth of the dominant chord); although supertonic and [[subtonic]] trills had been common in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era, they usually lasted only a half measure.

Extended cadential trills were by far most frequent in [[Mozart]]'s music, and although they were also found in early [[Romantic music era|Romantic music]], their use was restricted chiefly to [[Piano concertos by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|piano concerti]] (and to a lesser extent, [[violin concerto|violin concerti]]) because they were most easily played and most effective on the piano and violin; the cadential trill and resolution would be generally followed by an orchestral [[Coda (music)|coda]]. [[Beethoven]] was a good example of this, limiting it almost entirely to his concerti, and most other Romantic composers including [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] followed suit; [[Schubert]], who did not write any concerti, hardly used it at all (the [[Adagio and Rondo concertante in F major, D 487 (Schubert)|''Adagio and Rondo Concertante'' D. 487]], a chamber work, being one prominent exception). At the other end of the spectrum, even Mozart rarely used the trill in [[symphonies]]. Because the music generally became louder and more dramatic leading up to it, a cadence was used for climactic effect, and was often embellished by Romantic composers. Later on in the Romantic era, however, other dramatic virtuosic movements were often used to close sections instead.

==Jazz==
In [[jazz]], a cadence is often referred to as a [[turnaround (music)|''turnaround'']], chord progressions that lead back and resolve to the tonic (for example, the [[ii-V-I turnaround]]). Turnarounds may be used at any point and not solely before the tonic.

[[Half-step]] cadences are common in jazz if not cliché.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Carey (Spring, 2002). Untitled review: ''Harmonic Experience'' by W. A. Mathieu, p.125. ''Music Theory Spectrum'', Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 121–34.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ascending diminished seventh chord half-step cadence, which—using a [[secondary leading-tone chord|secondary diminished seventh chord]]—creates momentum between two chords a major second apart (with the diminished seventh in between).&lt;ref name="L&amp;H"&gt;Richard Lawn, Jeffrey L. Hellmer (1996). ''Jazz: Theory and Practice'', p.97-98. {{ISBN|978-0-88284-722-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;score lang="lilypond" vorbis="1"&gt; {
    \relative c' {

        &lt;b d f aes&gt;1 &lt;c es g bes&gt; \bar "||"
    }

}
&lt;/score&gt;

The descending diminished seventh chord half-step cadence is assisted by two [[common tone (chord)|common tones]].&lt;ref name="L&amp;H" /&gt;

    }

}
&lt;/score&gt;

==Rhythmic cadence==
Rhythmic cadences often feature a final note longer than the prevailing note values and this often follows a characteristic rhythmic pattern repeated at the end of the phrase.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S 91"/&gt; The example below shows a characteristic rhythmic cadence at the end of the first phrase of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s [[Brandenburg Concertos#No. 3 in G major, BWV 1048|''Brandenburg Concerto'' No. 3]] in G major, BMV 1048, mvmt. I, mm. 1–2:

'''Caleb Gattegno''' (1911–1988) was one of the most influential and prolific mathematics educators of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alsina|first1=Claudi|last2=Nelson|first2=Roger|title=Icons of mathematics : an exploration of twenty key images|date=2011|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|location=[Washington, D.C.]|isbn=978-0883853528|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his innovative approaches to teaching and learning mathematics (Visible &amp; Tangible Math), foreign languages ([[The Silent Way]]) and reading ([[Words in Color]]). He is also the inventor of pedagogical materials for each of these approaches, and the author of more than 120 books and hundreds of articles{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} largely on the topics of education and human development.

==Pedagogical approach==
Gattegno’s pedagogical approach is characterised by propositions based on the observation of human learning in many and varied situations. This is a description of three of these propositions.

===Learning and effort===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}
Gattegno noticed that there is an “energy budget” for learning. Human beings have a highly developed sense of the economics of their own energy and are very sensitive to the cost involved in using it. It is therefore essential to teach in ways that are efficient in terms of the amount of energy spent by learners. To be able to mathematically determine whether one method was more efficient than another, he created a unit of measurement for the effort used to learn. He called that unit an ''ogden'', and one can only say an ''ogden'' has been spent if the learning was done outside of ordinary functionings, and was retained. For example, learning one word in a foreign language costs one ''ogden'', but if the word cannot be recalled, the ''ogden'' has not truly been spent. Gattegno's teaching materials and techniques were designed to be economical with ''ogdens'', so that the most information can be recalled with the least sense of effort.

Certain kinds of learning are very expensive in terms of energy, i.e., ''ogdens'', while others are practically free. Memorization is a very expensive way to learn. The energy cost can be especially high when the content is of no particular interest to the learner. Memorizing dates in history or major exports of foreign countries is like that, for most people. School is not the only place where that kind of learning is found. Learning somebody's name or telephone number is equally arbitrary. We have to use our own energy to make such arbitrary items stick in our memories. The “mental glue” necessary is expensive, since that type of learning uses up a lot of energy.

Not only is that type of learning expensive, it tends also to be fragile. It is typically difficult to remember those kinds of items. Even when we make a great effort, we do not always succeed. We often recognise a face without being able to remember the name of the person ... not to mention all that almost all of us have forgotten much of what we "learned" at school.  It is not unusual for us to forget much of what we memorize.

However, there is another way of functioning, which Gattegno called retention. An example of retention is the reception of sensory images. When we look at something – a street, a film, a person, a fine view – photons move from what we are contemplating and enter our eyes to strike the retina. When we listen to something, we create auditory images in a similar way, that is, through energy that enters our system, rather than energy we allocate from inside, to memorize an arbitrary item. To retain an auditory or visual image, we have to use perhaps only an insignificant amount of our own to retain it; the amount is so small we are not aware of any effort. Such images are easily acquired and generally remain for long periods. We all have experiences similar to the following examples Gattegno offered:

'''''First experience:''' "I recently visited a village in the south of France where I had not been for over 10 years and I was able to say, 'Oh, yes, I know. The pharmacy is over there beyond the baker’s.' I went to see and there it was. I had made no effort to memorise this village square. It had entered my mind during my previous visits and it had remained there."''

'''''Second experience:''' "I visit a supermarket and go down the aisles. I see an unexceptional woman with a trolley. Three aisles further on, I see her again. I have not tried to remember her, but I have seen her and I can recognise her again a little later."''

Our system of retention is extremely efficient. We keep in our minds a huge quantity of information simply because we have seen, heard, tasted, smelled or felt it. That ability is part of human nature. It enables us to walk about our town without getting lost, to ski or to read a book.

Gattegno proposed that we base education, not on memorization, which has a high energetic cost and is often unreliable, but on retention. The learning tools and techniques Gattegno proposed rely systematically on retention.

===The subordination of teaching to learning===
Gattegno argued that for pedagogical actions to be effective, teaching should be subordinated to learning, which requires that as an absolute prerequisite teachers must understand how people learn. Rather than present facts for memorization, teachers construct challenges for students to conquer. If the student cannot conquer the challenge easily, the teacher does not tell the answer, but observes and asks questions to determine where the confusion lies, and what awareness needs to be triggered in the student.

The role of teachers is not to try to transmit knowledge, but to engender acts of awareness in their students, for only awareness is educable. Gattegno created pedagogical materials designed to provoke awarenesses. The materials are intended to be used along with techniques aimed at leading students through a succession of awarenesses. As the students progress, teachers who observe their students can see when and how they can induce a new act of awareness.

For example, he created [[Words in Colour]] for learning to read. Briefly, it consists of a series of word charts using a colour code in which each colour represents a phoneme of the language. The charts are used to provoke the phonological awareness in students of the sounds they are making and the order in which they are making them thus engendering all the awarenesses of how the graphemes relate to the phonemes and of how the spatial order of writing reflects the chronological order of speech. Other charts, called Fidels, list the graphemes for each phoneme.

He also used this colour code in [[The Silent Way]]  materials for learning foreign languages to enable students to identify and produce the sounds of the new language. [[Cuisenaire rods]] are used, particularly with beginners, to create visible and tangible situations from which the students can induce the structures of the language. The silence of the teacher both gives the students room to explore the language and frees the teacher to observe the students. The teacher is thus able to propose a sequence of pedagogical challenges adapted precisely to the evolution of the students’ learning. "If I would be remembered for anything", he said in one of his last seminars, "it would be that I painted the sounds with colours."

In his approach to teaching mathematics, manipulatives, such as Geoboards which he invented and Cuisenaire Rods which he popularised, are part of a way of systematically developing students’ mathematical thinking through the exploration of clear and tangible problems.

All the materials created by Gattegno were designed to allow teachers using them to place the accent systematically on the students’ learning rather than on what they, the teachers, do. Teachers watch their students deal with the challenges they are given, and provide them with feedback on their trials and errors. Teachers thus actively base their work on the awareness and awarenesses of the students, in the here and now. It is therefore very difficult for a teacher to closely follow a detailed lesson-plan, since the students are actively exploring the domain and have the freedom to take the lesson wherever they need it to go. The class becomes a kind of guided improvisation in which the teacher launches a challenge at a suitable level for the students, and if necessary nudges them into the awarenesses they need to have in order to learn. This is the case whatever the subject being dealt with, and is what is meant by Gattegno’s expression, “the subordination of teaching to learning”.

===Only awareness is educable===
Gattegno found that only awareness is educable in human beings. On the path to learning, several awarenesses must be reached. The first is the awareness that there is something to be learned, some unknown to become known. The next awarenesses are triggered by experience with the subject matter. For example, rather than ask a student to write "2+2=4," Gattegno might ask them to create the number 4 in as many ways as possible with colored rods. The student can then clearly see, feel, and describe the characteristics of the number 4. Instead of memorizing "2+2=4," the student has had a mathematical experience, and become aware that "4" can be broken into parts, and that the process of breaking apart and putting together can be described in several ways.

We are constantly becoming aware of new things. When it is something significant, the awareness is often audible in the form of the “Ah!” so typical of an important realisation. However, most realisations are made much more discretely. Indeed, as we live our everyday lives, we become aware of all sorts of things at great speed throughout the day: the price of bananas, that these bananas are not ripe enough, that the price of the yoghurts has been reduced because they are close to their sell-by date …. All our life is a succession of tiny awarenesses. Until we become aware of something, that thing remains totally unknown to us. As soon as we become aware of it and integrate it into our lives, we often no longer pay attention to it. But the moment of realisation, the act of learning, is an act of awareness.

The role of the teacher in acts of learning is not to inform students of this or that piece of information, but to help them to discover it, to perform a conscious act to become aware of it.

Gattegno suggests that '''learning takes place in four stages''' which can be described in terms of awareness.

'''The first stage''' consists in a single act of awareness: the realisation that there is something new to be explored. As long as I am unaware that there is something to be known, I cannot start to learn.

'''The second stage''': As soon as I start to learn, I have to explore the situation in order to understand it. As I am not yet an expert in the field, I make many mistakes. These mistakes enable me to progress because by observing what happens and becoming aware of it I can adapt my attempts in relation to the feedback given by the environment. This stage ends when I know what I have to do, but I only succeed when I am wholly present in what I am doing.

'''The third stage''' is a transitional stage. At the beginning, I am able to do what I want if I pay attention at each instant. At the end of this stage I no longer need to pay attention: the new skill has become completely automatic and because it is automatic, I am free to give my attention to learning other things.

'''The fourth stage''' is that of transfer. For the rest of my life, what I have learnt can be used for all the new skills I may wish to acquire. When I learnt to run, I used the know-how I had acquired from learning to walk. Both of these, walking and running, were useful to me when I decided to learn cross-country skiing. Each skill remains available, except in the rare cases of accident or injury, for a lifetime.

'''Capo di Bove''' is an archeological site on the [[Appian Way]] on the outskirts of [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. It contains the thermal baths of a vast property owned in the 2nd century AD by [[Herodes Atticus]] and his wife [[Aspasia Annia Regilla|Annia Regilla]].

Formerly privately owned, the property at No. 222 on the Appian Way was acquired by the Italian Government in 2002. The area of the baths was at that time being used for grape growing. The origin of the name given to the site dates back to medieval times, when the area was known as the “Casale di Capo di Bove e di Capo di Vacca” (Hamlet of the Heads of the Ox and Cow), so named after the sculptures on the nearby tomb of [[Caecilia Metella (daughter of Metellus Creticus)|Caecilia Metella]]. The area was purchased in 1302 by Cardinal Francesco Caetani, nephew of [[Pope Boniface VIII]]. In the 17th century the area served as a hospital while in the 19th century it was under the control of the monastery at the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]].&lt;ref&gt;Italian Archeology Ministry http://archeoroma.beniculturali.it/it/luoghi/aree_monumenti/villa_capo_bove {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130061323/http://archeoroma.beniculturali.it/it/luoghi/aree_monumenti/villa_capo_bove# |date=2010-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Capo di Bove2.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaic in the baths]]
The excavations, which can be visited daily free of charge, revealed thermal baths dating back to the middle of the 2nd century. These baths were used until at least the 4th century and were almost certainly for private use. Greek inscriptions found there remind us of the Greek origins of Herodes Atticus. There are several well-preserved [[mosaic]]s and the high quality of building materials used suggest a very elegant environment with the usual rooms found in [[Thermae|Roman baths]], i.e. a ''[[caldarium]]'' (hot bath), a ''[[tepidarium]]'' (warm bath) and ''[[frigidarium]]'' (cold bath). Water was provided by two large [[cistern]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Italian Archeology Ministry http://archeoroma.beniculturali.it/it/luoghi/aree_monumenti/villa_capo_bove {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130061323/http://archeoroma.beniculturali.it/it/luoghi/aree_monumenti/villa_capo_bove# |date=2010-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site also includes a former farmhouse converted by the previous occupant of the site into a villa. The building incorporates numerous Roman ruins into the walls, including pipes from the baths that are built into some of the windows. An internal exhibition contains photographs of the Appian Way in the first half of the 20th Century.

'''''Chu''''' (廚, lit. "kitchen") is a [[Daoist]] name used for various religious practices including communal ''chu'' (Kitchen) banquet rituals in [[Way of the Celestial Masters]] liturgy, the legendary ''xingchu'' (行廚, Mobile Kitchen) associated with Daoist ''[[xian (Daoism)|xian]]'' ("transcendents; 'immortals'"), and ''wuchu'' (五廚, Five Kitchens) representing the ''[[Zang-fu#Yin/yang and the Five Elements|wuzang]]'' (五臟, Five Viscera) in ''[[neidan]]'' meditation techniques.

==Terminology==
''Chú'' ("kitchen; to cook; a cook") can be written with three [[Chinese characters]] 廚, 㕑, and 厨. The common [[traditional Chinese character]] [[wikt:廚|廚]] combines the [[Radical 53|"house radical"]] [[wikt:广|广]] with a phonetic indicator ''shù'' [[wikt:尌|尌]] (joining ''zhù'' [[wikt:壴|壴]] "drum" and ''cùn'' [[wikt:寸|寸]] "hand"); and the [[Variant Chinese character|variant]] traditional character [[wikt:㕑|㕑]] has [[Radical 27|"cliff radical"]] [[wikt:厂|厂]] instead of 广. The [[simplified Chinese character]] [[wikt:厨|厨]] omits the [[wikt:士|士]] element in 壴, leading to a "graphic [[folk etymology]]" of "A 厂 'room' for cooking [[wikt:豆|豆]] 'beans' with your 寸 'hands'." (Bishop 2016). The Chinese [[logograph]] 廚 was anciently used as a [[Chinese character classification#Rebus (phonetic loan) characters|loan character]] for ''chú'' [[wikt:櫥|櫥]] (with the [[Radical 75|"wood radical"]] 木, "cabinet") or ''chú'' [[wikt:幮|幮]] ([[Radical 50|"cloth radical"]] 巾, "a screen used for a temporary kitchen").

The [[Modern Standard Chinese]] lexicon uses ''chu'' in many [[Compound (linguistics)|compound words]], for instance, ''chúfáng'' ([[wikt:廚房|廚房]] with 房 "room", "kitchen"), ''chúshī'' ([[wikt:廚師|廚師]] with 師 "master", "cook; chef"), ''chúdāo'' ([[wikt:廚刀|廚刀]] with 刀 "knife", "kitchen knife"), and ''páochú'' ([[wikt:庖廚|庖廚]] with 庖 "kitchen", meaning "kitchen").

In Daoist specialized vocabulary, ''chu'' names a Kitchen-feast communal meal, and sometimes has a technical meaning of "magic", "used to designate the magical recipes through which one becomes invisible" (Maspero 1981: 290). The extensive [[semantic field]] of ''chu'' can be summarized in some key Daoist expressions: ritual banquets, communion with divinities, granaries (''zang'' 藏, a word that also denotes the viscera), visualization of the Five Viscera (''wuzang'' 五臟, written with the [[Radical 130|"flesh radical"]] ⺼), and abstention from cereals (''[[Bigu (grain avoidance)|bigu]]''), and other food proscriptions (Mollier 2008a: 279). According to Daoist classics, when ''[[Bigu (grain avoidance)|bigu]]'' "grain avoidance" techniques were successful, ''xingchu'' (行廚, Mobile Kitchens or ''tianchu'' (天廚, Celestial Kitchens) were brought in gold and jade vessels by the ''yunü'' (玉女, Jade Women) and ''jintong'' (金僮, Golden Boys), associated with the legendary [[Jade Emperor]] (Despeux 2008: 233-234).

[[Chinese Buddhist]] terminology applies ''chu'' (廚, cf. 櫥 "cabinet") "kitchen; kitchen cupboard" to denote the "cabinet for an image or relic of the Buddhas", translating [[Sanskrit]] ''bhakta-śālā'' "food-hall" or ''mahânasa'' "kitchen" ([[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]]).

In [[Chinese astronomy]], ''Tiānchú'' (天廚, Celestial Kitchen) is the name of an [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] in the constellation [[Draco in Chinese astronomy|Draco]], located next to ''Tiānbàng'' (天棓, Celestial [[Flail]]), and ''Nèichú'' (內廚, Inner Kitchen).

==Translations==
There is no standard English translation for either Daoist ''chu'' (廚, Kitchen) or ''xingchu'' (行廚, Mobile Kitchen). The former is rendered as:
*"kitchen festival", "kitchen feast" (Stein 1979)
*"Kitchens" (Maspero 1981)
*"kitchen banquets" (Verellen 2004)
*"cuisines" (Campany 2005, Kleeman 2008, Mollier 2008a)
*"Kitchens" (Mollier 2009)
*"cuisines" (Kroll 2017) 
These [[Anglophone]] scholars render Chinese ''chu'' as either English ''[[wikt:kitchen|kitchen]]'' ("a room for preparing food"), optionally clarified with ''K-'', -''festival'' or -''feast'', or ''[[wikt:cuisine#English|cusine]]'' ("a characteristic style of cooking, often associated with a place of origin"). The latter follows [[Francophone]] sinologists, for instance [[Henri Maspero|Maspero]] (1971) and Mollier (1999), who accurately translated Chinese ''chu'' as French ''[[wikt:cuisine#French|cuisine]]'' ("kitchen; cooking") and ''xingchu'' as ''cusine de voyage'' ("travel kitchen"). Although English ''kitchen'' and French ''cuisine'' are [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] deriving from Latin [[wikt:coquina#Latin|''cocīna'']] ("cooking; kitchen"), they are [[false friends]] with significant semantic differences between English ''kitchen'' and ''cuisine''. Chinese usually translates English ''kitchen'' as chúfáng ([[wikt:廚房|廚房]], "kitchen") and ''cuisine'' as ''pēngrèn'' ([[wikt:烹飪|烹飪]], "art of cooking").

The term ''xingchu'' (行廚) has been translated as
*"Traveling Canteen" (Ware 1966)
*"mobile kitchen" (Sivin 1968)
*"perform the Kitchen" (Maspero 1981)
*"travelling kitchen-feast" (Penny 2000)
*"traveling canteen' (Campany 2002)
*"traveling kitchen" (Campany 2005)
*"movable cuisines" (Despeux 2008, Mollier 2008a)
*"Mobile Kitchens" (Mollier 2009)
[[Joseph Needham]] calls Ware's "Traveling Canteen" a "bizarre translation" (1976: 29). While Maspero uniquely interprets the ''xing'' ([[wikt:行|行]]) in ''xingchu'' as a verb ("to perform"), the other scholars read it as a modifier ("to go; to move") translated as ''traveling'', ''mobile'', or ''movable'' (cf. ''[[wikt:movable feast|movable feast]]''). The ''chu'' noun in ''xingchu'' is translated as English ''kitchen'', ''cuisine'', or ''[[wikt:canteen|canteen]]''. However, the latter ambiguous word has several meanings besides ''[[cafeteria|canteen]]'' ("a cafeteria or snack bar provided by an organization"), ''[[Canteen (bottle)|canteen]]'' ("a small water bottle"), and [[British English]] ''canteen'' ("a case or box containing a cutlery set"). To further complicate translating ''xingchu'', ''travelling canteen'' was the 18th-century equivalent of a [[picnic basket]]. In modern terms, the ''xingchu'' is comparable with a [[Mobile catering|mobile kitchen]] (Sivin's translation), military [[field kitchen]], [[food truck]], or [[food cart]].

==''Chu'' Kitchen feast== 
The ''chu'' (廚, Kitchen), also known as ''fushi'' (福食, "good luck meal"), was a religious banquet that usually involved preliminary fasting and purification before consuming a meal of vegetarian food and [[Alcoholic drinks in China|Chinese wine]]. The banquet was hosted by families on the occasion of births and deaths, prepared for a ritually-fixed number of parishioners, and accompanied by specific ritual gifts to the Daoist priest. Although the Kitchen Feast became a regular element of organized Daoist religious traditions, scholars do not know the date when it was introduced into the liturgy. One early textual record is the c. 499 ''[[Zhen'gao]]'' saying that Xu Mi (許谧, 303-376) offered a Kitchen meal to five persons (Stein 1979: 57). 

These communal ''chu'' Kitchen banquets have a pre-Daoist antecedent in popular [[Chinese folk religion]]: the term ''chu'' was anciently used for the ceremonial meals organized by communities to honor the ''[[Tudigong#Names|she]]'' (社, God of the Soil). Although orthodox Daoists criticized, and sometimes banned, these ''chuhui'' (廚會, "cuisine congregations") for making immoral animal sacrifices, they nevertheless perpetuated the custom by adapting and codifying it (Mollier 2008a: 279). ''Chu'' kitchen-feasts have many features in common with another Daoist ritual meal, the ''zhāi'' (齋, "fast; purification; retreat"), and the two are frequently treated as having the same functions. The 7th-century Daoist ''Zhaijielu'' (齋戒錄, Records of Fasting) suggested that ''zhai'' were anciently called ''shehui'' (社會, "festival gatherings of the soil god"—now the modern Chinese word for "society"), which was later changed into ''zhaihui'' (齋會) (Stein 1979: 75).
 
The [[Way of the Celestial Masters]] religion, founded by [[Zhang Daoling]] in 142 CE, celebrated ''chu'' kitchen festivals at New Year and the annual ''sanhui'' (三會, Three Assemblies), which were major Daoist festivals held in the first, seventh, and tenth lunar months, when believers assembled at their local parish to report any births, deaths, or marriages, so that the population registers could be updated. Parishioners who had reason to celebrate on these occasions would host a ''chu'' feast for other members of the community in proportion to the significance of their auspicious event and their means. Accounts of these banquets "emphasize both the sharing of food and the affirmation of the unique, religious merit-based social order of the Daoist community" (Kleeman 2008: 839-840).

The ''chu'' sacrament had three levels of banquets and ritual gifts, depending upon what the family was celebrating. For the birth of a boy, the ''shangchu'' (上廚, Superior Ceremony of the Kitchen) was a banquet offered to the priest and ten members of the parish, with gifts to the priest of a hundred sheets of paper, a pair of [[ink brushes]], an [[inkstick]], and an ink scraper. For the birth of a girl, it was the less expensive ''zhongchu'' (中廚, Middle Ceremony of the Kitchen) with a banquet for five parishioners, and the gifts, which the parents had to provide within one month following the birth, were a mat, a wastebasket, and a broom. For the death of a family member, the ''xiachu'' (下廚, Inferior Ceremony of the Kitchen), also called ''jiechu'' (解廚, Kitchen of Deliverance), is not described in Daoist texts, and we only know that the rival Buddhist polemicists claimed it was a "great orgy" (Maspero 1981: 290). 

The anti-Daoist ''Erjiaolun'' (二教論, Essay on Two Religions) by the Buddhist monk [[Dao'an]] (312–385) said ''chu'' kitchen-feasts were intended to bring about ''jiěchú'' (解除, "liberation and elimination") from pollution and sins, which were connected with the soil god and tombs (Stein 1979: 71). The parallel passage in the 6th-century ''Bianhuolun'' (辯惑論, Essay on Debating Doubts) uses the homophonous [[Variant Chinese character|graphic variant]] of ''jiěchú'' (解廚, "liberation kitchen"), thus connecting both ''chú'' "kitchen" and ''chú'' "liberation" to non-Daoist gods of the soil (Stein 1979: 74).

Daoist sources record that the people invited to a ''chu'' Kitchen feast would first observe a period of purification that included fasting and abstention from sex. Kitchen rituals lasted for one, three, or seven days. Participants consumed exclusively vegetarian food and moderate amounts of wine, which was considered as a mandatory element of the banquet (Mollier 2008a: 279). For the Superior Kitchens five ''[[Chinese units of measurement#Volume|sheng]]'' of wine (about a liter) per person was planned, for the Middle Kitchens, four ''sheng'', and for the Inferior Kitchen three. The participants "must have departed a bit happy, but not drunk." (Maspero 1981: 290). The leftovers were given to other parishioners who could thereby share in the ritual. 

Besides annual festivals on fixed dates like the Three Assemblies, ''chu'' Kitchen ceremonies were also performed in special circumstances, particularly when there was disease, sin, or death pollution. They were believed to have exorcistic and salvific powers and to confer good luck or merit upon the adepts (Mollier 2008a: 279). Kitchen ceremonies often involved Daoist ritual ''jiao'' (醮, "offerings") of cakes and pieces of fabric in order to obtain particular favors, such as petitions for recovery from illnesses, prayers for rain in time of drought, and thanksgivings for favors received. An altar was laid out in the open air, and the priest recited prayers (Maspero 1981: 34-35).

[[Ge Hong]]'s c. 318 ''[[Baopuzi]]'' (see below) mentions profligately expensive ''chu'' Kitchen Feasts in contrasting heterodox ''yaodao'' (妖道, "demonic cults"), which involved sacrificing animals to gods who enjoyed their blood, with the undefined term ''Lijia dao'' (李家道, "religion of the adepts of Li") (Stein 1979: 56). The context praises the contemporary charlatan healer Li Kuan (李寬) for not following the ancient tradition of animal sacrifice, while blaming him for extravagance. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The more than a hundred ways for dealing with demons [諸妖道百餘種] all call for slaying living creatures so that their blood may be drunk. Only the doctrine of the Lis [李家道] is slightly different. Yet, though it does no butchering, whenever its "good-luck food" is served [每供福食], it includes varieties of mixtures without limit. In planning the meal, one strives for sumptuousness, and the rarest things must be purchased. Several dozen may work in the kitchen [或數十人廚], and costs for food can run high indeed. In tum, these are not completely disinterested affairs, and they might well be classed with things to be forbidden. (tr. Ware 1966: 158) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Xingchu'' Mobile Kitchen traditions==
In Daoist hagiographies and stories, the esoteric ability to summon a ''xingchu'' (行廚, Mobile Kitchen) was a standard [[Trope (literature)|trope]] for the powers of a ''xian'' transcendent. The ''xingchu'', which Campany called a "curious business" (2002: 29), was a sumptuous banquet of rare delicacies, exotic foods, and wines that could be instantly served up by spirits anywhere on command.

The tradition of ''xingchu'' "meditational cuisines" or "contemplative cuisines" seems to have developed in a parallel and complementary manner to the ''chu'' "communal cuisine liturgy" (Mollier 2008a: 280). ''Xian'' transcendents were portrayed as eschewing what counted in China as ordinary foods, especially grains (see ''[[Bigu (grain avoidance)|bigu]]''), and instead eating superior, longevity-inducing substitutes such as sesame seeds and ''[[Lingzhi mushroom|lingzhi]]'' mushrooms, typically found in distant and legendary places removed from the heartland of agriculture-based Chinese civilization. Transcendents were frequently depicted as winged beings able to fly long distances rapidly and summoning a ''xingchu'' banquet at will eliminated the need to travel across the world and heavens in order to obtain rare foodstuffs of immortality (Campany 2005: 46-47).

The [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] Daoist scholar [[Ge Hong]] compiled the two primary sources of information about ''xingchu'' Mobile Kitchens, the ''Baopuzi'' and ''Shenxian zhuan''. Ge portrayed adepts seeking ''xian''-hood as avoiding ordinary food such as grains, instead eating "rare, exotic foodstuffs from the far reaches of the cosmos", marvelous products conveying the "numinous power" suggested by their peculiarity. "The ability to command at will a spirit-hosted serving of exotic food and drink in elegant vessels may seem trivial, but when one recalls that many Daoist scriptures prohibit the feasting on sacrificial meats and liquors enjoyed by the aristocracy, and that many adepts did their work on mountains and were isolated from agricultural communities and markets, the practice assumes a more serious aspect." (Campany 2002: 221)

===Baopuzi===
The c. 318 CE "Inner Chapters" of the ''[[Baopuzi]]'' (Master Who Embraces Simplicity) have nine occurrences of the word ''xingchu'' (行廚, Mobile Kitchen). Seven of them are in contexts of alchemical medicines and elixirs, most of which have poisonous [[toxic heavy metal]] ingredients. The ''Baopuzi'' uses two related verbs for beckoning a Mobile Kitchen: ''zhì'' (至, "arrive at; reach; come") and ''zhì'' (致, "cause to arrive at; get to; come to"). The other two ''xingchu'' usages are in proper names of a Daoist [[Fulu|amulet]] and book, the ''Xingchu fu'' (行廚符, Amulet of the Traveling Kitchen), and the ''Xingchu jing'' (行廚經, Scripture of the Traveling Kitchen). The ''Baopuzi'' also lists another book titled ''Riyue chushi jing'' (日月廚食經, Scripture of the Kitchen Meals of the Sun and the Moon) (19, Ware 1966: 384, 380, 381).

Three of the seven ''Baopuzi'' elixirs are said to have dual purpose usages, long-term consumption is said to grant ''xian'' transcendence, including the ability to summon ''xingchu'', and short-term consumption provides a panacea—specifically for eliminating the [[Three Corpses]] or Three Worms, demons that live within the human body and hasten their host's death, and the [[Three Corpses#Baopuzi|Nine Worms]] or Nine Vermin, broadly meaning internal worms and parasites. First, the ''Xian Menzi dan'' (羡門子丹, Master Xian Men's Elixir) is prepared from wine and cinnabar. "After it has been taken for one day the Three Worms and all illnesses are immediately purged from the patient. If taken for three years, it will confer geniehood and one is sure to be served by two fairies, who can be employed to summon the Traveling Canteen [可役使致行廚]." (4, tr. Ware 1966: 84; cf. Campany 2002: 290). Second, a list of methods for eating and drinking realgar says, "In each case it confers Fullness of Life; all illnesses are banished; the Three Corpses drop from the body; scars disappear; gray hair tums black; and lost teeth are regenerated. After a thousand days, fairies [translating ''yunu'' 玉女 Jade Maiden] will come to serve you and you can use them to summon the Traveling Canteen [以致行廚]." (11, tr. Ware 1966: 188). Third, consuming pure, unadulterated [[Lacquer#Urushiol-based lacquers|lacquer]] will put a man in communication with the gods and let him Enjoy Fullness of Life. When eaten with pieces of crab in mica or jade water, "The Nine Insects will then drop from you, and the bad blood will leave you through nose-bleeds. After a year, the six-''chia'' gods and the Traveling Canteen will come to you [一年六甲行廚至也]." (11, tr. Ware 1966: 190). This ''liujia'' (六甲, Six ''[[Celestial stem#Table|Jia]]'' Gods) and the ''liuyin'' (六陰, Six Yin) below refer to [[Chinese astrology|astrological]] [[Qimen Dunjia|Dunjia]] divination. An alternate translation is "the six ''jia'' and the traveling canteen will arrive" (Campany 2002: 75),

The remaining four ''Baopuzi'' formulas are said to create stronger and more versatile elixirs. Fourth, the ''Jiuguang dan'' (九光丹, Ninefold Radiance Elixir) is made by processing certain unspecified ingredients with the ''wushi'' (五石, Five Minerals, see [[Cold-Food Powder]]), i.e., [[cinnabar]], [[realgar]], purified [[potassium alum]], laminar [[malachite]], and [[magnetite]] (Needham et al. 1976: 86). Each mineral is put through five alchemical cycles and assumes five hues, so that altogether twenty-five hues result, each with specific powers, for example, the blue elixir will revive a recently deceased person. "If you wish to summon the Traveling Canteen [欲致行廚], smear your left hand with a solution of black elixir; whatever you ask for will be at your beck and call, and everything you mention will arrive without effort. You will be able to summon any thing or any creature in the world." (tr. Ware 1966: 82-83, noting "fragrant foods served in plates of gold and cups of jade"). Fifth, the ''Baopuzi'' quotes from ''Shennong sijing'' (神農四經, [[Shennong]]'s Four Classics), "Medicines of the highest type put the human body at ease and protract life so that people ascend and become gods in heaven, soar up and down in the air, and have all the spirits at their service. Their bodies grow feathers and wings, and the Traveling Canteen comes whenever they wish [行廚立至]." (11, tr. Ware 1966: 177). Sixth, the method of Wu Chengzi (務成子) compounds alchemical gold from realgar, yellow sand, and mercury, and then forms it into small pills. Coating the pills with different substances will produce magical effects, for instance, if one is smeared with ram's blood and thrown into a stream, "the fish and the dragons will come out immediately, and it will be easy to catch them." And, "If it is coated with hare's blood and placed in a spot belonging to the Six Yin, the Traveling Canteen and the fairies will appear immediately and place themselves at your disposal [行廚玉女立至], to a total of sixty or seventy individuals." (16, tr. Ware 1966: 276). Seventh, Liu Gen (劉根, or Liu Jun'an 劉君安), who Ware wrongly identifies as the Daoist prince and author [[Liu An]] (劉安, Campany 2002: 248), learned the art of metamorphosis from an alchemical text attributed to the [[Mohist]] founder [[Mozi]], the ''Mozi wuxing ji'' (墨子五行記, Master Mo's Records of the [[Wu Xing|Five Phases]]), and successfully used its medicines and amulets, "By grasping a pole he becomes a tree. He plants something, and it immediately produces edible melons or fruit. He draws a line on the ground, and it becomes a river; he piles up dirt and it becomes a hill. He sits down and causes the Traveling Canteen to arrive [坐致行廚]." (19, tr. Ware 1966: 316).

===Shenxian zhuan===
The c. 318 ''[[Shenxian zhuan]]'' (Hagiographies of Divine Transcendents) uses ''xingchu'' (行廚, Mobile Kitchen) six times. The hagiography of Wang Yuan gives a detailed description of summoning a ''xingchu''. Other adepts who are also said to have this ability include Li Gen, Liu Jing, Zuo Ci, Liu Zheng, and Taixuan nü (Campany 2002: 222).

[[File:Portrait of the Immortal Magu - Ma Hezhi - Song Dynasty.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of the Immortal Magu'' ([[National Palace Museum]], Taipei)]]
First, the hagiography of Wang Yuan (王遠) and [[Magu (deity)|Magu]] (Cannabis Maiden) says Wang was a Confucianist scholar who quit his official post during the reign (146-168 CE) of [[Emperor Huan of Han]] and went into the mountains to study Daoist techniques. Wang achieved ''xian'' transcendence through ''[[Shijie (Daoism)#Shenxian zhuan|shijie]]'' "liberation by means of a simulated corpse", described with the traditional [[Shijie (Daoism)#Cicada metaphor|cicada metaphor]], his "body disappeared; yet the cap and garments were completely undisturbed, like a cicada shell." During his travels, Wang met the peasant Cai Jing (蔡經), whose [[physiognomy]] indicated he was destined to become a transcendent, so Wang took him on as a disciple, taught him the basic techniques, and left. Soon afterwards Cai also used alchemical ''shijie'' liberation, his body became extremely hot, and his flesh and bones melted away for three days. "Suddenly he had vanished. When his family looked inside the blanket, only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell." (tr. Campany 2002: 260).

After Cai had been gone for "over a decade", he unexpectedly returned home, looking like a young man, announced to his family that Lord Wang would visit on the "seventh day of the seventh month" (later associated with the [[Cowherd and Weaver Girl]] lovers' festival), and ordered them to "prepare great quantities of food and drink to offer to his attendants." When Wang Yuan and his heavenly entourage arrived on the auspicious "double-seven" day, he invited his old friend Magu to join their celebration because it had been over five hundred years since she had been "in the human realm." When the Cannabis Maiden and her attendants arrived at Cai's household,
&lt;blockquote&gt;She appeared to be a handsome woman of eighteen or nineteen; her hair was done up, and several loose strands hung down to her waist. Her gown had a pattern of colors, but it was not woven; it shimmered, dazzling the eyes, and was indescribable – it was not of this world. She approached and bowed to Wang, who bade her rise. When they were both seated, they called for the travelling canteen [坐定召進行廚]. The servings were piled up on gold platters and in jade cups without limit. There were rare delicacies, many of them made from flowers and fruits, and their fragrance permeated the air inside [Cai's home] and out. When the meat was sliced and served, [in flavor] it resembled broiled ''mo'' and was announced as ''kirin'' meat. (tr. Campany 2002: 262) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare Maspero's translation, "everyone steps forth to 'perform the Kitchen'" (1981: 291). [[Guo Pu]]'s commentary to the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'' described the ''[[Mo (Chinese zoology)|mò]]'' (貘, [[giant panda]]) as "bear-like, black and white, and metal-eating" (tr. Harper 2013: 216); and the mystical ''[[qilin]]'' beast is sometimes identified as a Chinese unicorn (Penny 2008: 731).

Wang Yuan then announced to the Cai family that he had brought some exceptional wine from the Tianchu (天廚, Heavenly Kitchen) asterism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;I wish to present you all with a gift of fine liquor. This liquor has just been produced by the celestial kitchens. Its flavor is quite strong, so it is unfit for drinking by ordinary people; in fact, in some cases it has been known to burn people's intestines. You should mix it with water, and you should not regard this as inappropriate." With that, he added a ''dou'' of water to a ''sheng'' of liquor, stirred it, and presented it to the members of Cai Jing's family. On drinking little more than a ''sheng'' of it each, they were all intoxicated. After a little while, the liquor was all gone. (tr. Campany 2002: 263) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In traditional [[Chinese units of measurement ]], a ''dǒu'' ([[wikt: 斗| 斗]]) was approximately equivalent to 10 liters and a ''shēng'' [[wikt:升|升]]) approximately 1 liter. 

Second, the ''Shenxian zhuan'' narrative of Li Gen (李根) says he studied under Wu Dawen (吳大文) and obtained a method for producing alchemical gold and silver.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Li Gen could transform himself [into other forms] and could enter water and fire [without harm]. He could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive, and with it could serve twenty guests [坐致行廚能供二十人]. All the dishes were finely prepared, and all of them contained strange and marvelous foods from the four directions, not things that were locally available. (tr. Campany 2002: 219) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Third, Liu Jing (劉京) was an official under [[Emperor Wen of Han]] (r. 180-157 BCE) who "abandoned the world and followed Lord Zhang 張君 of [[Handan]] to study the Way." By using methods for subsisting on "efflorescence of vermilion" pills [朱英丸] and "cloud-mother [mica]" pills, Liu "lived to be one hundred thirty years old. To look at him, one would judge him to be a person in his thirties." He could also foretell the auspiciousness of future events. (tr. Campany 2002: 249).

The Shangqing (Supreme Purity) tradition ''Han Wu Di neizhuan'' (漢武帝内傳, Esoteric Traditions of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Han Emperor Wu]]), which was written between 370 and 500, has some later accretions that resemble ''Shenxian zhuan'' (Campany 2002: 76). The passage about Liu Jing says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Later he served Ji Zixun [薊子訓, i.e., Ji Liao 薊遼] as his teacher. Zixun transmitted to him all the secret essentials of the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Five Thearchs]], Numinous Flight (''lingfei'', 靈飛), the six ''jia'' spirits, the Twelve Matters (''shier shi'' 十二事), and the Perfected Forms of the Ten Continents of Divine Transcendents (shenxian shizhou zhenxiang 神仙十洲真形). Liu Jing practiced them all according to the instructions, and they were mightily efficacious. He could summon ghosts and spirits, immediately cause wind and rain to arise, cause the traveling canteen to arrive [名致行廚], and appear and disappear at will. He also knew the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of people's future affairs and of particular days. (tr. Campany 2002: 449) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fourth, the transcendent [[Zuo Ci]] (左慈) was a ''[[fangshi]]'' ("method master") famous for his abilities at divination, ''[[fenshen]]'' multilocation, and [[shapeshifting]] (Pregadio 2008: 1305),
&lt;blockquote&gt;Seeing that the fortunes of the Han house were about to decline, he sighed and said, "As we move into this declining [astral] configuration, those who hold eminent offices are in peril, and those of lofty talent will die. Winning glory in this present age is not something to be coveted." So he studied arts of the Dao. He understood particularly well [how to summon] the six ''jia'' spirits, how to dispatch ghosts and other spirits, and how to sit down and call for the traveling canteen [坐致行廚]. (tr. Campany 2002: 279) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fifth, the ''Shenxian zhuan'' says that Liu Zheng (劉政) used the same alchemical text attributed to Mozi that the ''Baopuzi'' says was used by Liu Gen (劉根, or Liu Jun'an 劉君安, see Campany 2002: 240-249).
&lt;blockquote&gt;Later he arranged [a copy of] Master Mo's Treatise on the Five Phases (''Mozi wuxing ji'' 墨子五行記) and, [based on it], ingested "efflorescence of vermilion" pills. He lived for more than one hundred eighty years, and his complexion was that of a youth. He could transform himself into other shapes and conceal his form; multiply one person into a hundred or a hundred into a thousand or a thousand into ten thousand; conceal a military force of three brigades by forming them into a forest or into birds and beasts, so that they could easily take their opponents' weapons without their knowledge. Further, he was capable of planting fruits of all types and causing them immediately to flower and ripen so as to be ready to eat. He could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive [生致行廚], setting out a complete meal for up to several hundred people. His mere whistling could create a wind to set dust swirling and blow stones about. (tr. Campany 2002: 322) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Transcendental whistling]] was an ancient Daoist yogic technique.

Sixth, the brief hagiography of the female transcendent Taixuan nü (太玄女, Woman of the Grand Mystery) says.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Woman of the Grand Mystery was surnamed Zhuan 顓 and named He 和. While still young, she was bereaved of her husband, so she practiced the Way. Disciplining herself in the arts of the Jade Master, (Yuzi) she could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive [坐致行廚], and there was no sort of transformation she could not accomplish. (tr. Campany 2002: 367). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, the ''Shenxian zhuan'' hagiography for Mao Ying (茅盈) describes what sounds like a ''xingchu'' without using the name (Campany 2002: 328). After twenty years studying the Dao, Mao Ying returned home to his parents and announced that he had been commanded to enter heaven and become a transcendent. The people of his home village came to give him a going-away party, and Mao said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am touched by your sincere willingness to send me off, and I deeply appreciate your intention. But please come empty-handed; you need not make any expenditure. I have a means whereby to provide a feast for us all." On the appointed day, the guests all arrived, and a great banquet was held. Awnings of blue brocade were spread out, and layers of white felt were spread out beneath them. Rare delicacies and strange fruits were piled up and arrayed. Female entertainers provided music; the sounds of metal and stone mingled together, and the din shook Heaven and Earth; it could be heard from several ''li'' away. Of the more than one thousand guests present that day, none failed to leave intoxicated and sated. (tr. Campany 2002: 327) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Mao Ying and his brothers Mao Gu (茅固) and Mao Zhong (茅衷) are considered of the founders of the [[Shangqing School]] of Daoism.

Shangqing Daoists took the stock literary phrase ''zuo zhi xingchu'' (坐致行廚)—used above in the ''Baopuzi'' for Liu Gen, "sits down and causes the Traveling Canteen to arrive" (tr. Ware), and in the ''Shenxian zhuan'' for Li Gen, Zuo Ci, and Taixuan nü, "sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive" (tr. Campany)—and actualized it as a visualization technique for "making the movable cuisines come [while] sitting [in meditation]" (tr. Mollier). "This method, accessible only to the initiate who possessed the proper series of talismans (''fu'' 符) and had mastered certain visualization techniques, conferred powers to become invisible, to cause thunder, and to call for rain." This form of [[zazen|sitting meditation]] was so popular during the Tang period that [[Chinese Esoteric Buddhism]] also adopted it. (Mollier 2008a: 280)

==''Wuchu'' Five Kitchens meditation== 
Following upon the Celestial Masters liturgical Kitchen feasts and ''xian'' transcendents' Mobile Kitchens, the third stage of Daoist ''chu'' traditions was the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) ''wǔchú'' (五廚, Five Kitchens) contemplation technique, which recast the concept of ritual banquets in terms of psychophysiological ''[[neidan]]'' Internal Alchemy (Verellen 2004: 351). In Chinese cosmological [[Wu Xing|wuxing]] Five Phases correspondence theory, the ''wuchu'' Five Kitchens or ''wuzang'' (五臟, Five Viscera / Orbs) system includes not only the physiological internal organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and spleen), but also the associated psychological range of mental and emotional states (Roth 1999: 41-42). The 735 ''Wuchu jing'' (五廚經, Scripture of the Five Kitchens), which poetically describes a visualization practice for circulating ''[[qi]]'' energies through the Five Viscera, was so popular that Tang Buddhists forged the esoteric ''Sānchú jīng'' (三廚經, Sutra of the Three Kitchens) based on the Daoist text (Mollier 2008b: 1051).

There are two extant editions of ''Wuchu jing'' (translated by Kohn 2010: 198-206). First, the 763 Tang ''[[Daozang]]'' (Daoist Canon) edition titled ''Laozi shuo Wuchu jing zhu'' (老子說五廚經, Commentary to the Scripture of the Five Kitchens as Revealed by [[Laozi]]) contains a preface dated 735 and a commentary, both signed by Yin Yin (尹愔, d. 741). The [[List of people with reduplicated names|reduplicatedly named]] Yin Yin was a prominent Daoist and Confucian scholar under [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (r. 712-756), and abbot of the Suming guan (肅明觀, Abbey of Reviving Light) temple in the capital [[Chang'an]]. The late Tang [[Way of the Celestial Masters|Celestial Master]] Zhao Xianfu (趙仙甫, fl. 732) also wrote a commentary (Verellen 2004: 351). Second, the 1019 ''[[Yunji Qiqian]]'' (Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel) anthology edition titled ''Wuchu jing qifa'' (五廚經氣法, Energetic Methods of the Scripture of the Five Kitchens), also includes Yin's commentary, with slight variations, such as noting the text was presented to the emperor in 736 (Verellen 2004: 351). The ''qi'' "energetic" methods of the text are recommended by [[Zuowanglun#Author|Sima Chengzhen]] (司馬承禎, 647–735) in his ''Fuqi jingyi lun'' (服氣精義論, Essay on the Essential Meaning of Breath Ingestion) text on physical self-cultivation (Mollier 2008b: 1051). Although the presence of Yin's preface might suggest a Tang date for the ''Wuchu jing'', the origins of this text may be much earlier. [[Ge Hong]]'s c. 318 ''Baopuzi'' mentions a ''Xingchu jing'' (行廚經, Scripture of the Movable Kitchens) and a ''Riyue chushi jing'' (日月廚食經, Scripture of the Kitchen Meals for the Sun and the Moon), which could be the ancestors of the received texts (Mollier 2008b: 1051). 

The c. 905 ''Daojiao lingyan ji'' (道教靈驗記, Record of Daoist Miracles, written by the Daoist priest, author, and court official [[Du Guangting]], says a [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] fraudulently transformed the ''Wuchu jing'' Scripture of the Five Kitchens into the ''Sanchu jing'' (三廚經, Sutra of the Three Kitchens). Du records that the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] of the Tang period contained a text titled ''Fo shuo san tingchu jing'' (佛說三停廚經, Sutra of the Three Interrupted Kitchens, Preached by the Buddha) (Verellen I992: 248-249). According to Du Guangting, the monk Xingduan (行端), who had "a presumptuous and fraudulent disposition", saw that the widely-circulated Daoist ''Wuchu jing'' consisted of five stanzas (''jì'' 偈, "''[[gatha]]''; poetic verse; versified utterance") of incantations (''zhòu'' 咒, "''[[mantra]]''; religious incantation; mystical invocation"), rearranged them, and expanded the title into ''Fo shuo san tingchu jing'' (佛說三停廚經). "The five incantations he turned into 'five sutras spoken by [[Tathagata]],' and at the end he added a hymn. The additional phrases amounted to no less than a page." Verellen suggests that the scripture, with its "Buddho-Daoist content and quasi-magical use", originated as a late [[Six Dynasties]] (220-589) Tantric ''zhoujing'' (咒經, "incantations scripture", cf. the ''[[Divine Incantations Scripture]]''). (1992: 250-51).

Du Guangting gives a lengthy narrative about the Daoist miracle involving supernatural retribution for Xingduan's forgery. One day after the monk had already given several copies of the altered scripture to others, a "divine being eight or nine feet tall" and holding a sword reprimands him for the counterfeiting and brandishes his sword to strike the monk. As Xingduan "wards off the blow with his hand, several fingers are lopped off", he begs for mercy, and the Daoist deity agrees to spare his life if he retrieves and destroys all the fakes. Xingduan and his companions search everywhere for the texts, but can only find half of them, the remainder having already been carried abroad by Buddhist monks. Xingduan prepares ten fresh copies of the original scripture, offers incense, repents, and burns the altered copies. Then the divine being reappears and announces: "Having vilified the sage's text, restitution won't save you—you do not deserve to escape death", the monk falls prostrate and dies on the spot (Verellen 1992: 251). 

In the present day, early copies of this apocryphal Buddhist sutra have been preserved. Four textual versions were discovered in the Chinese [[Dunhuang manuscripts]], two versions, dated 1099 and 1270, are kept in the Japanese [[Koyasan Reihōkan|Mount Kōya]] manuscripts. In addition, the modern Japanese [[Taishō Tripiṭaka]] canon includes the text (Mollier 2009: 26-28).

The highly abstract ''Wuchu jing'' mystical poem comprises five stanzas consisting of four five-character lines each. The ''Yunqi qiqian'' edition shows that the five stanzas were associated with the Five Directions of space: east (lines 1-4), south (lines 5-8), north (lines 9-12), west (lines 13-16), and center (lines 17-20) (Verellen 2004: 351). For example, the first four lines (tr. Kohn 2010: 200-201):
{{Verse translation|lang=zh|italicsoff=y|rtl1=y|一氣和泰和
得一道皆泰
和乃無一和
玄理同玄際
|The ''qi'' of universal oneness merges with the harmony of cosmic peace. 
Attaining universal oneness, Dao rests in cosmic peace.
Cosmic harmony really is neither universal oneness nor harmony.
Mysterious cosmic order joins the mysterious moment of eternity.
}}

The content of the ''Wuchu jing'' guides adepts toward a detached mental state of non-thinking and equanimity. The Five Kitchens refer to ''neidan'' Internal Alchemy "''qi''-processing on a subtle-body level", and signify the energetic, transformative power of the Five Viscera (Kohn 2010: 71). Yin Yin's introduction says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;As long as you dwell in the ''qi'' of universal oneness [一氣] and in the harmony of cosmic peace [泰和], the five organs [五臟] are abundant and full and the five spirits [五神] are still and upright. "When the five organs are abundant, all sensory experiences are satisfied; when the five spirits are still, all cravings and desires are eliminated. This scripture expounds on how the five organs taking in ''qi'' is like someone looking for food in a kitchen. Thus, its title: "Scripture of the Five Kitchens." (tr. Kohn 2010: 200) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Commenting on Yin's interpretation, Du Guangting claims more explicitly that practicing this scripture will enable an adept to stop eating. (Verellen 2004: 352)

Techniques in the ''Wuchu jing'' (五廚經, Scripture of the Five Kitchens) mainly involve visualizing the Five Viscera of the body and chanting incantations. These methods supposedly allow the adept to obtain satisfaction and harmony, and, after some years of training, even transcendence (Mollier 2008a: 279-280). Despite this concern with the human body, the text strongly emphasizes mental restructuring over physical practices, saying that "accumulating cultivation will not get you to detachment" and that methods of ingestion are ultimately useless. However, reciting the scripture is beneficial, especially if combined with mental and ethical practices, so that "you will easily get the true essentials of cultivating the body-self and protecting life." More specifically, chanting the text one hundred times and practicing the harmonization of the five ''qi'' allows adepts to abstain from grain and eliminate hunger (Mollier 1999: 62-63). Many present-day Daoists consider the ''Wuchu jing'' as a talismanic text to be chanted for protection (Kohn 2010: 71).

{{Marxism|Schools of thought}}
'''Classical Marxism''' refers to the economic, philosophical and sociological theories expounded by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] as contrasted with later developments in [[Marxism]], especially [[Leninism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]].

==Karl Marx==
[[File:Marx4.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Karl Marx]] in 1861]]
{{details|Karl Marx}}
Karl Heinrich Marx (May 5, 1818, [[Trier]], [[German Confederation|Germany]] &amp;ndash; March 14, 1883, [[London]]) was an immensely influential German [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]], [[political economist]] and [[revolutionary socialist]]. Marx addressed a wide range of issues, including [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and exploitation of the worker, the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] and historical materialism, although he is most famous for his analysis of history in terms of class struggles, summed up in the opening line of the introduction to ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'': "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles". The influence of his ideas, already popular during his life, was given added impetus by the victory of the [[Russia]]n [[Bolsheviks]] in the 1917 [[October Revolution]] and there are few parts of the world which were not significantly touched by Marxian ideas in the course of the twentieth century.

As the American Marx scholar [[Hal Draper]] remarked: "[T]here are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike".

===Early influences===
{{main|The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism}}
{{details|Influences on Karl Marx}}
The early influences on Marx are often grouped into three categories: German philosophy, English/Scottish political economy and French socialism.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/mar/x01.htm The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism]''&amp;nbsp;by [[Vladimir I. Lenin]] at the [[Marxists Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====German philosophy====
Main influences include [[Immanuel Kant]]; [[G. W. F. Hegel]]; and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. 

Marx studied under one of Hegel's pupils, [[Bruno Bauer]], a leader of the circle of [[Young Hegelians]] to whom Marx attached himself. However, from 1841 he and Engels came to disagree with Bauer and the rest of the Young Hegelians about socialism and also about the usage of Hegel's dialectic and progressively broke away from [[German idealism]] and the Young Hegelians. Marx's early writings are thus a response towards Hegel, German idealism and a break with the rest of the Young Hegelians. Marx, "stood Hegel on his head", in his own view of his role by turning the idealistic dialectic into a materialistic one, in proposing that material circumstances shape ideas instead of the other way around. In this, Marx was following the lead of Feuerbach. His [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]], developed in the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844|Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (published in 1932), inspired itself from Feuerbach's critique of the alienation of Man in God through the [[objectivation]] of all his inherent characteristics (thus man projected on God all qualities which are in fact man's own quality which defines the "[[human nature]]"). But Marx also criticized Feuerbach for being insufficiently materialistic.

====English and Scottish political economy====
Main influences include [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]. 

Marx built on and critiqued the most well-known political economists of his day, the British classical political economists.

Marx critiqued Smith and Ricardo for not realizing that their economic concepts reflected specifically capitalist institutions, not innate natural properties of human society and could not be applied unchanged to all societies. He proposed a systematic correlation between labour-values and money prices. He claimed that the source of profits under capitalism is value added by workers not paid out in wages. This mechanism operated through the distinction between "labour power", which workers freely exchanged for their wages; and "labour", over which asset-holding capitalists thereby gained control. This practical and theoretical distinction was Marx's primary insight, and allowed him to develop the concept of "surplus value", which distinguished his works from that of Smith and Ricardo.

====French socialism====
Main influences include [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]; [[Charles Fourier]]; [[Henri de Saint-Simon]]; [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]; and [[Louis Blanc]].

Rousseau was one of the first modern writers to seriously attack the institution of [[private property]] and therefore is sometimes considered a forebear of modern [[socialism]] and [[communism]], though Marx rarely mentions Rousseau in his writings.

In 1833, France was experiencing a number of social problems arising out of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. A number of sweeping plans of reform were developed by thinkers on the [[Left-wing politics|political left]]. Among the more grandiose were the plans of [[Charles Fourier]] and the followers of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]. Fourier wanted to replace modern cities with utopian communities while the Saint-Simonians advocated directing the economy by manipulating credit. Although these programs did not have much support, they did expand the political and social imagination of Marx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta – France |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568934_23/France.html#p464 |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR60qYA?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568934_23/France.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Blanc]] is perhaps best known for originating the social principle, later adopted by Marx, of how labor and income should be distributed: “From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta – Communism |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572241/Communism.html#p9 |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR6a1r6?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572241/Communism.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] participated in the February 1848 uprising and the composition of what he termed "the first republican proclamation" of the new republic, but he had misgivings about the new government because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of the socio-economic reform, which Proudhon considered basic. Proudhon published his own perspective for reform, ''Solution du problème social'', in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from capitalists and financiers to workers. It was Proudhon's book ''[[What Is Property?]]'' that convinced the young Karl Marx that [[private property]] should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon|first=Pierre-Joseph|title=What is property?|year=2007|publisher=Cosimo Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602060944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other influences on Marx====
Main influences includes [[Friedrich Engels]]; [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] [[materialism]]; [[Giambattista Vico]]; and [[Lewis H. Morgan]].

Marx's revision of [[Hegelianism]] was also influenced by Engels' book  ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844, which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution.

Marx was influenced by Antique materialism, especially [[Epicurus]] (to whom Marx dedicated his thesis,  ''[[The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature]]'', 1841) for his materialism and theory of [[clinamen]] which opened up a realm of liberty.

[[Giambattista Vico]] propounded a [[cyclical theory]] of history, according to which human societies progress through a series of stages from barbarism to civilization and then return to barbarism. In the first stage—called the Age of the Gods—religion, the family and other basic institutions emerge; in the succeeding Age of Heroes, the common people are kept in subjection by a dominant class of nobles; in the final stage—the Age of Men—the people rebel and win equality, but in the process society begins to disintegrate. Vico's influence on Marx is obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta - Giambattista Vico |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551498/Giambattista_Vico.html |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR5SlMg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551498/Giambattista_Vico.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx drew on [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and his [[social evolution]] theory. He wrote a collection of notebooks from his reading of Lewis Morgan, but they are regarded as being quite obscure and only available in scholarly editions. (However Engels is much more noticeably influenced by Morgan than Marx).

==Friedrich Engels==
{{details|Friedrich Engels}}
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Friedrich Engels]] was a co-founder and proponent of [[Marxism]]]]
Friedrich Engels (November 28, 1820, [[Wuppertal]] – August 5, 1895, [[London]]) was a nineteenth-century German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]]. He developed [[Communism|communist]] theory alongside his better-known collaborator, [[Karl Marx]].

In 1842, his father sent the young Engels to England to help manage his cotton factory in Manchester. Shocked by the widespread [[poverty]], Engels began writing an account which he published in 1845 as ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' ([http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm]).

In July 1845, Engels went to England, where he met an Irish working-class woman named [[Mary Burns]] ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_4.shtml Crosby]), with whom he lived until her death in 1863 (Carver 2003:19). Later, Engels lived with her sister Lizzie, marrying her the day before she died in 1877 (Carver 2003:42). These women may have introduced him to the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, of whose leaders he met several, including [[George Julian Harney|George Harney]].

Engels actively participated in the [[Revolution of 1848]], taking part in the uprising at [[Elberfeld]]. Engels fought in the [[Baden campaign]] against the [[Prussia]]ns (June/July 1849) as the [[aide-de-camp]] of [[August Willich]], who commanded a Free Corps in the Baden-Palatinate uprising. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/german-imperial/ch01.htm]

===Marx and Engels===
Marx and Engels first met in person in September 1844. They discovered that they had similar views on [[philosophy]] and on [[capitalism]] and decided to work together, producing a number of works including ''Die heilige Familie'' (''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''). After the French authorities deported Marx from France in January 1845, Engels and Marx decided to move to Belgium, which then permitted greater [[freedom of expression]] than some other countries in Europe. Engels and Marx returned to Brussels in January 1846, where they set up the Communist Correspondence Committee.

In 1847, Engels and Marx began writing a pamphlet together, based on Engels' ''The Principles of Communism''. They completed the 12,000-word pamphlet in six weeks, writing it in such a manner as to make communism understandable to a wide audience and published it as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled both Engels and Marx. They moved to Cologne, where they began to publish a radical newspaper, the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]''. By 1849, both Engels and Marx had to leave Germany and moved to London. The Prussian authorities applied pressure on the British government to expel the two men, but [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] refused. With only the money that Engels could raise, the Marx family lived in extreme poverty. The contributions of Marx and Engels to the formation of Marxist theory have been described as inseparable.&lt;ref&gt;For example see [[Franz Mehring]]: “The more their thought and their development became one, the more they each remained a separate entity and a man”, in Mehring: ''Karl Marx: The Story of His Life'' (1918), Chapter 8 Marx and Engels [http://www.marxists.org/archive/mehring/1918/marx/ch08.htm#s2 2. An Incomparable Alliance]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main ideas==
Marx's main ideas included:
* [[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]]: Marx refers to the alienation of people from aspects of their "human nature" ("''Gattungswesen''", usually translated as "species-essence" or "species-being"). He believed that alienation is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and in so doing generate alienated labour.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology'', Article: Alienation&lt;/ref&gt; Alienation describes objective features of a person's situation in capitalism—it is not necessary for them to believe or feel that they are alienated.
* [[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|Base and superstructure]]: Marx and Engels use the “base-structure” concept to explain the idea that the totality of relations among people with regard to “the social production of their existence” forms the economic basis, on which arises a superstructure of political and legal institutions. To the base corresponds the social consciousness which includes religious, philosophical and other main ideas. The base conditions both, the superstructure and the social consciousness. A conflict between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production causes social revolutions and the resulting change in the economic basis will sooner or later lead to the transformation of the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;See Marx: ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Preface], Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas,
and Engels: ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' (1877), Introduction [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/introduction.htm General]
&lt;/ref&gt; For Marx, this relationship is not a one way process—it is reflexive and the base determines the superstructure in the first instance at the same time as it remains the foundation of a form of social organization which is itself transformed as an element in the overall dialectical process. The relationship between superstructure and base is considered to be a [[dialectics|dialectical]] one, [[ineffability|ineffable]] in a sense except as it unfolds in its material reality in the actual historical process (which [[scientific socialism]] aims to explain and ultimately to guide).
* [[Class consciousness]]: class consciousness refers to the awareness, both of itself and of the social world around it, that a [[social class]] possesses and its capacity to act in its own rational interests based on this awareness. Thus class consciousness must be attained before the class may mount a successful revolution. However, other methods of revolutionary action have been developed, such as [[vanguardism]].
* [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|Exploitation]]: Marx refers to the exploitation of an entire segment or class of society by another. He sees it as being an inherent feature and key element of capitalism and free markets. The profit gained by the capitalist is the difference between the value of the product made by the worker and the actual wage that the worker receives—in other words, capitalism functions on the basis of paying workers less than the full value of their labor in order to enable the capitalist class to turn a profit.
* [[Historical materialism]]: historical materialism was first articulated by Marx, although he himself never used the term. It looks for the causes of developments and changes in human societies in the way in which humans collectively make the means to life, thus giving an emphasis through economic analysis to everything that co-exists with the economic base of society (e.g. social classes, political structures, ideologies).
* [[Means of production]]: the means of production are a combination of the [[means of labor]] and the [[subject of labor]] used by workers to make products. The means of labor include machines, tools, equipment, infrastructure and "all those things with the aid of which man acts upon the subject of labor, and transforms it".&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. (1957). xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of labor includes raw materials and materials directly taken from nature. Means of production by themselves produce nothing— [[labour (economics)|labor power]] is needed for production to take place.
* [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|Ideology]]: without offering a general definition for "ideology",&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCarney:
''[http://marxmyths.org/joseph-mccarney/article.htm Ideology and False Consciousness]'', April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Marx on several instances has used the term to designate the production of images of social reality. According to Engels, “ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a false consciousness. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces”.&lt;ref&gt;Engels: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm Letter] to [[Franz Mehring]], (London July 14, 1893), transl. by Donna Torr, in ''Marx and Engels Correspondence'', International Publishers 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ruling class controls the society's means of production, the superstructure of society as well as its ruling ideas will be determined according to what is in the ruling class's best interests. As Marx said famously in ''The German Ideology'', “the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm  Karl Marx, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore the ideology of a society is of enormous importance since it confuses the alienated groups and can create [[false consciousness]] such as commodity fetishism (perceiving labor as capital—a degradation of human life).
* [[Mode of production]]: the mode of production is a specific combination of [[productive forces]] (including human the [[means of production]] and [[labour power]], tools, equipment, buildings and technologies, materials and improved land) and social and technical [[relations of production]] (including the property, power and control relations governing society's productive assets, often codified in law, cooperative work relations and forms of association, relations between people and the objects of their work and the relations between social classes).
* [[Political economy]]: the term "political economy" originally meant the study of the conditions under which production was organized in the nation-states of the new-born capitalist system. Political economy then studies the mechanism of human activity in organizing material and the mechanism of distributing the surplus or deficit that is the result of that activity. Political economy studies the means of production, specifically capital and how this manifests itself in economic activity.

===Marx's concept of class===
{{Ref improve section|date=May 2012}}
Marx believed that class identity was configured in the relations with the mode of production. In other words, a class is a collective of individuals who have a similar relationship with the means of production (as opposed to the more common-sense idea that class is determined by wealth alone, i.e. high class, middle class and poor class).

Marx describes several [[social class]]es in capitalist societies, including primarily:
* The [[proletariat]]: "those individuals who sell their [[labor power]], (and therefore add value to the products), and who, in the capitalist mode of production, do not own the means of production". According to Marx, the capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions for the [[bourgeoisie]] to [[Exploitation of labour#Marxian theory|exploit]] the proletariat due to the fact that the worker's [[labor power]] generates an [[Surplus value|added value]] greater than his [[salary]].
* The [[bourgeoisie]]: those who "own the means of production" and buy [[labor power]] from the proletariat, who are recompensed by a salary, thus [[Exploitation of labour#Marxian theory|exploit]]ing the proletariat.
The bourgeoisie may be further subdivided into the very wealthy bourgeoisie and the [[petty bourgeoisie]]. The petty bourgeoisie are those who employ labor, but may also work themselves. These may be small proprietors, land-holding peasants, or trade workers. Marx predicted that the petty bourgeoisie would eventually be destroyed by the constant reinvention of the means of production and the result of this would be the forced movement of the vast majority of the petty bourgeoisie to the proletariat. Marx also identified the [[lumpenproletariat]], a stratum of society completely disconnected from the means of production.

Marx also describes the [[communists]] as separate from the oppressed proletariat. The communists were to be a unifying party among the proletariat; they were educated revolutionaries who could bring the proletariat to revolution and help them establish the democratic [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Communist Manifesto]] 80-87&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marx, the communists would support any true revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Thus the communists aide the proletariat in creating the inevitable classless society ([[Vladimir Lenin]] takes this concept a step further by stating that only "professional revolutionaries" can lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie).

===Marx's theory of history===
{{main|Marx's theory of history}}
The Marxist theory of historical materialism understands society as fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given time—this means the relationships which people enter into with one another in order to fulfill their basic needs, for instance to feed and clothe themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Marx and Engels identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". (Marx, Karl, Letter to editor of the Russian paper Otetchestvennye Zapiskym, 1877) His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of '''comics in education''' is based on the concept of creating engagement and motivation for students. 

==Overview==

'''Contemporary Latin''' is the form of the [[Latin language]] used from the end of the 19th century through the present. Various kinds of contemporary Latin can be distinguished. On the one hand there is its survival in areas such as [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] as the result of the widespread presence of the language in the [[New Latin]] era. This is usually found in the form of mere words or phrases used in the general context of other languages. On the other hand, there is the use of Latin as a language in its own right as a full-fledged means of expression. Living or Spoken Latin, being the most specific development of Latin in the contemporary context, is the primary subject of this article.

==Token Latin==
As a relic of the great importance of [[New Latin]] as the formerly dominant international ''[[lingua franca]]'' down to the 19th century in a great number of fields, Latin is still present in words or phrases used in many languages around the world, and some minor [[Living Latin|communities]] use Latin in their speech.

===Mottos===
The official use of Latin in previous eras has survived at a symbolic level in many mottos that are still being used and even coined in Latin to this day. Old mottos like {{lang|la|[[E pluribus unum]]}}, found in 1776 on the [[Seal of the United States]], along with {{lang|la|[[Annuit cœptis]]}} and {{lang|la|[[Novus ordo seclorum]]}}, and adopted by an Act of Congress in 1782, are still in use. Similarly, current [[pound sterling]] coins are minted with the Latin inscription ''ELIZABETH·II·D·G·REG·F·D'' ({{lang|la|Dei Gratia Regina, Fidei Defensor}}, i.e. Queen by the Grace of God, Defender of the Faith). The official motto of the multilingual European Union, adopted as recently as 2000, is the Latin {{lang|la|[[In varietate concordia]]}}. Similarly, the motto on the [[Canadian Victoria Cross]] is in Latin, perhaps due to Canada's bilingual status.

===Fixed phrases===
Some common phrases that are still in use in many languages have remained fixed in Latin, like the well-known {{lang|la|[[dramatis personæ]]}} or {{lang|la|[[habeas corpus]]}}.

===In science===
{{details|International scientific vocabulary|English words of Greek origin}}
In fields as varied as mathematics, physics, astronomy, medicine, pharmacy, and biology,&lt;ref name=Yancey1944&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yancey |first=P.H. |title=Introduction to Biological Latin and Greek |journal=Bios |date=March 1944 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=3–14 |jstor=4604798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin still provides internationally accepted names of concepts, forces, objects, and organisms in the natural world.

The most prominent retention of Latin occurs in the classification of living organisms and the [[binomial nomenclature]] devised by [[Carl Linnaeus|Carolus Linnæus]], although the [[nomenclature codes|rules of nomenclature]] used today allow the construction of names which may deviate considerably from historical norms.

Another continuation is the use of Latin names for the constellations and celestial objects (used in the [[Bayer designations]] of stars), as well as [[planetary nomenclature|planets]] and satellites, whose surface features have been given Latin [[selenography|selenographic]] toponyms since the 17th century.

Symbols for many of those chemical elements of the [[periodic table]] known in ancient times reflect and echo their Latin names, like Au for {{lang|la|aurum}} (gold) and Fe for {{lang|la|ferrum}} (iron).

===Vernacular vocabulary===
Latin has also contributed a vocabulary for specialised fields such as anatomy and law which has become part of the normal, non-technical vocabulary of various European languages. Latin continues to be used to form [[international scientific vocabulary]] and [[classical compound]]s. Separately, more than 56% of the vocabulary used in English today derives ultimately from Latin, either directly (28.24%) or through French (28.30%).&lt;ref&gt;According to the computerised survey of about 80,000 words in the old Shorter Oxford Dictionary (3rd ed.) published in ''Ordered Profusion'' by Thomas Finkenstaedt and Dieter Wolff, [[Latin influence in English]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecclesiastical Latin==
{{Main article|Ecclesiastical Latin}}
The [[Catholic Church]] has continued to use Latin. Two main areas can be distinguished. One is its use for the official version of all documents issued by [[Vatican City]], which has remained intact to the present. Although documents are first drafted in various vernaculars (mostly Italian), the official version is written in Latin by the [[Latin Letters Office]]. The other is its use for the liturgy, which has diminished after the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1962–65, but seems to have recently seen some resurgence{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}, sponsored in part by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].

After the [[Church of England]] published the [[Book of Common Prayer]] in English in 1559, a 1560 Latin edition was published for use at universities such as Oxford and the leading public schools, where the liturgy was still permitted to be conducted in Latin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/Latin1560/BCP_Latin1560.htm |title=Liber Precum Publicarum – The Book of Common Prayer in Latin (1560) |website=Justus.anglican.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been several Latin translations since. Most recently a Latin edition of the 1979 USA Anglican Book of Common Prayer has appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/Latin1979/Latin_1979.htm |title=Liber Precum Publicarum: the 1979 US Book of Common Prayer in Latin |website=Justus.anglican.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic Latin==
Latin has also survived to some extent in the context of [[classics|classical scholarship]]. Some classical periodicals, like ''[[Mnemosyne (journal)|Mnemosyne]]'' and the German ''Hermes'', to this day accept articles in Latin for publication.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad M. Kokoszkiewicz, "A. Gellius, ''Noctes Atticæ, 16.2.6: tamquam si te dicas adulterum negent''", ''Mnemosyne'' 58 (2005) 132–135; "''Et futura panda'' siue de Catulli carmine sexto corrigendo", ''Hermes'' 132 (2004) 125–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin is used in most of the introductions to the critical editions of ancient authors in the [[Oxford Classical Texts]] series, and it is also nearly always used for the [[apparatus criticus]] of Ancient Greek and Latin texts.

The University Orator at the [[University of Cambridge]] makes a speech in Latin marking the achievements of each of the honorands at the annual Honorary Degree Congregations, as does the Public Orator at the [[Encaenia]] ceremony at the [[University of Oxford]]. [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] also have [[Salutatorian#Latin salutatorian|Latin Salutatory]] commencement addresses every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47u6IJ2GVdM |title=Harvard's Latin Salutatory Address 2007 |publisher=YouTube |date=12 June 2007 |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Charles University in Prague]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lfhk.cuni.cz/article.asp?nArticleID=180&amp;nDepartmentID=1068&amp;nLanguageID=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730135114/http://lfhk.cuni.cz/article.asp?nArticleID=180&amp;nDepartmentID=1068&amp;nLanguageID=1 |archivedate=30 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other universities around the world conduct the awarding of their [[doctorate|doctoral]] degrees in Latin. Other universities and other schools issue diplomas written in Latin.

In addition to the above, [[Brown University|Brown]], [[Sewanee: The University of the South|Sewanee]], and [[Bard College]] also hold in Latin a portion of their graduation ceremonies.

The famous song {{lang|la|[[Gaudeamus igitur]]}} is acknowledged as the anthem of academia and is sung at university opening or graduation ceremonies throughout Europe.

==Living Latin==
Living Latin ({{lang|la|Latinitas viva}} in Latin itself), also known as Spoken Latin, is an effort to revive Latin as a spoken language and as the vehicle for contemporary communication and publication. Involvement in this Latin revival can be a mere hobby or extend to more serious projects for restoring its former role as an [[international auxiliary language]].

===Origins===
After the decline of Latin at the end of the [[New Latin]] era started to be perceived, there were attempts to counteract the decline and to revitalize the use of Latin for international communication.

In 1815, [[Miguel Olmo]] wrote a booklet proposing Latin as the common language for Europe, with the title {{lang|la|Otia Villaudricensia ad octo magnos principes qui Vindobonæ anno MDCCCXV pacem orbis sanxerunt, de lingua Latina et civitate Latina fundanda liber singularis}} ("Leisure{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} of [[Villaudric]] to the eight great princes who ordained world peace at Vienna in 1815, an extraordinary book about the Latin language and a Latin state to be founded").&lt;ref&gt;IJsewijn, Jozef, ''Companion to Neo-Latin Studies. Part I. History and Diffusion of Neo-Latin Literature'', Leuven University Press, 1990, p. 112s.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, Latin periodicals advocating the revived use of Latin as an international language started to appear. Between 1889 and 1895, [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] published in Italy his {{lang|la|Alaudæ}}.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wilfried Stroh (ed.), ''Alaudæ. {{lang|de|Eine lateinische Zeitschrift 1889–1895 herausgegeben von [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]]. Nachdruck mit einer Einleitung von Wilfried Stroh}}'', Hamburg, MännerschwarmSkript Verlag, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This publication was followed by the {{lang|la|Vox Urbis: de litteris et bonis artibus commentarius}},&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{lang|la|Volfgangus Jenniges, "''Vox Urbis'' (1898–1913) quid sibi proposuerit"|italic=unset}}, ''Melissa'', 139 (2007) 8–11.&lt;/ref&gt; published by the architect and engineer [[Aristide Leonori]] from 1898, twice a month, until 1913, one year before the outbreak of [[World War I]].

The early 20th century, marked by warfare and by drastic social and technological changes, saw few advances in the use of Latin outside academia. Following the beginnings of the [[European integration|re-integration of postwar Europe]], however, Latin revivalism gained some strength.

One of its main promoters was the former dean of the [[University of Nancy]] (France), Prof. [[Jean Capelle (politician)|Jean Capelle]], who in 1952 published a cornerstone article called "Latin or Babel"&lt;ref&gt;Published on 23 October 1952 in the French {{lang|fr|Bulletin de l'Éducation Nationale}}, an English version of the same was published in ''The Classical Journal'' and signed by himself and Thomas H. Quigley ([https://www.jstor.org/pss/3292933 ''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 49, No. 1, October 1953, pp. 37–40])&lt;/ref&gt; in which he proposed Latin as an international spoken language.

Capelle was called "the soul of the movement" when in 1956 the first International Conference for Living Latin ({{lang|fr|Congrès international pour le Latin vivant}}) took place in [[Avignon]],&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin B. Beach, "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3294350 The Congress for Living Latin: Another View]", ''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 53, No. 3, December 1957, pp. 119–122:&lt;/ref&gt; marking the beginning of a new era of the active use of Latin. About 200 participants from 22 different countries took part in that foundational conference.

===Pronunciation===
The essentials of the classical pronunciation had been defined since the early 19th century (e.g. in K.L. Schneider's {{lang|de|Elementarlehre der Lateinischen Sprache}}, 1819), but in many countries there was strong resistance to adopting it in instruction. In English-speaking countries, where the [[traditional English pronunciation of Latin|traditional academic pronunciation]] diverged most markedly from the restored classical model, the struggle between the two pronunciations lasted for the entire 19th century. The transition between Latin pronunciations was long drawn out;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Latin in Church |author=F. Brittain |page=60 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJFxBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60 |edition=first |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1907 the "new pronunciation" was officially recommended by the [[Department for Education|Board of Education]] for adoption in schools in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/Recommendations_of_the_Classical_Association_on_the_Teaching_of_Latin_1000467486/21 |title=Recommendations of the Classical Association on the Teaching of Latin |website=Forgottenbooks.com |access-date=1 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060943/http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/Recommendations_of_the_Classical_Association_on_the_Teaching_of_Latin_1000467486/21 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The School World: A Monthly Magazine of Educational Work and Progress|volume=9|year=1907|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IhYLAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:0NYZ2-_Sekiq-KKpSqyTg7Y&amp;hl=en#PRA1-PA88,M1 |publisher=Macmillan &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the older pronunciation, as found in the nomenclature and terminology of various professions, continued to be used for several decades, and in some spheres prevails to the present day, contemporary Latin as used by the living Latin community has generally adopted the classical pronunciation of Latin as restored by specialists in Latin historical phonology.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Prof. Edgar H. Sturtevant (''The Pronunciation of Greek and Latin'', Chicago Ares Publishers Inc. 1940) and Prof. [[W. Sidney Allen]] (''{{lang|la|Vox Latina}}, A Guide to the Pronunciation of Classical Latin'', Cambridge University Press 1965), who followed in the tradition of previous pronunciation reformers; cf. [[Erasmus]]'s {{lang|la|De recta Latini Græcique sermonis pronuntiatione dialogus}} and even [[Alcuin]]'s {{lang|la|De orthographia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar shift occurred in German-speaking areas: the traditional pronunciation is discussed in {{ill|Deutsche Aussprache des Lateinischen|de|Deutsche Aussprache des Lateinischen|vertical-align=sup}} {{de icon}}, while the reconstructed classical pronunciation, which took hold around 1900, is discussed at {{ill|Schulaussprache des Lateinischen|de|Schulaussprache des Lateinischen|vertical-align=sup}}.

===Aims===
Many users of contemporary Latin promote its use as a spoken language, a movement that dubs itself "Living Latin". Two main aims can be distinguished in this movement:

====For Latin instruction====
{{Main article|Instruction in Latin}}

Among the proponents of spoken Latin, some promote the active use of the language to make learning Latin both more enjoyable and more efficient, drawing upon the [[language teaching|methodologies]] of instructors of modern languages.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Association for the Reform of Latin Teaching]] (ARLT, still existing as the Association for Latin Teaching), was founded in 1913 by the distinguished classical scholar [[W. H. D. Rouse]]. It arose from summer schools which Rouse organised to train Latin teachers in the [[direct method (education)|direct method of language teaching]], which entailed using the language in everyday situations rather than merely learning [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] by rote. The [[Classical Association]] also encourages this approach. The [[Cambridge University Press]] has now published a series of school textbooks based on the adventures of a mouse called [[Minimus]], designed to help children of primary school age to learn the language, as well as its well-known [[Cambridge Latin Course]] (CLC) to teach the language to secondary school students, all of which include extensive use of dialogue and an approach to language teaching mirroring that now used for most modern languages, which have brought many of the principles espoused by Rouse and the ARLT into the mainstream of Latin teaching.

Outside Great Britain, one of the most accomplished handbooks that fully adopts the direct method for Latin is the well-known {{lang|la|Lingua Latina per se illustrata}} by the Dane [[Hans Henning Ørberg]], first published in 1955 and improved in 1990. It is composed fully in Latin, and requires no other language of instruction, and it can be used to teach pupils whatever their mother tongue.

====For contemporary communication====
Others support the [[language revival|revival]] of Latin as a language of international communication, in the academic, and perhaps even the scientific and diplomatic, spheres (as it was in Europe and European colonies through Middle Ages until the mid-18th century), or as an [[international auxiliary language]] to be used by anyone. However, as a language native to no people, this movement has not received support from any government, national or supranational.

===Supporting institutions and publications===
A substantial group of institutions (particularly in Europe, but also in North and South America) has emerged to support the use of Latin as a spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circuluslatinuslondiniensis.co.uk/Vincula.html |title=Vincula – Circulus Latínus Londiniénsis |website=Circuluslatinuslondiniensis.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundational first International Conference for living Latin ({{lang|fr|Congrès international pour le Latin vivant}}) that took place in [[Avignon]] was followed by at least five others.&lt;ref&gt;The fifth conference took place in Pau, France, from the 1st to 5 April 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of those first conferences, the {{lang|la|Academia Latinitati Fovendae}} was then created in Rome. Among its most prominent members are well-known [[classicist]]s from all over the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011091728/http://www.academialatina.org/sodales.html|title=Academia Latinitati Fovendae - SODALES|date=11 October 2006|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; like Prof. [[Michael von Albrecht]] or Prof. {{Interlanguage link multi|Kurt Smolak|de}}. The ALF held its first international conference in Rome in 1966 bringing together about 500 participants. From then on conferences have taken place every four or five years, in [[Bucharest]], Malta, [[Dakar]], [[Erfurt]], Berlin, Madrid, and many other places. The official language of the ALF is Latin and all acts and proceedings take place in Latin.

Also in the year 1966 [[Clément Desessard]] published a method with tapes within the series {{lang|fr|sans peine}} of the French company [[Assimil]].  Desessard's work aimed at teaching contemporary Latin for use in an everyday context, although the audio was often criticized for being recorded with a thick French accent.  Assimil took this out of print at the end of 2007 and published another Latin method which focused on the classical idiom only.  However, in 2015 Assimil re-published Desessard's edition with new audio CDs in restored classical Latin pronunciation.  Desessard's method is still used for living Latin instruction at the {{lang|la|Schola Latina Universalis}}.

In 1986 the Belgian [[radiologist]] [[Gaius Licoppe]], who had discovered the contemporary use of Latin and learnt how to speak it thanks to Desessard's method, founded in Brussels the {{lang|la|[[Fundatio Melissa]]}} for the promotion of Latin teaching and use for communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundatiomelissa.org/fundatiomelissa/Salvete.html |title=MELISSA sodalitas perenni Latinitati dicata |website=Fundatiomelissa.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, [[Marius Alexa]] and [[Inga Pessarra-Grimm]] founded in September 1987 the {{lang|la|Latinitati Vivæ Provehendæ Associatio}} (LVPA, or Association for the Promotion of Living Latin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lvpa.de/ |title=Pagina domestica – L.V.P.A. e.V |website=Lvpa.de |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first {{lang|la|Septimana Latina Amoeneburgensis}} (Amöneburg Latin Week) was organized in 1989 at Amöneburg, near Marburg in Germany, by [[Mechtild Hofmann]] and [[Robert Maier]]. Since then the Latin Weeks were offered every year. In addition, members of the supporting association {{lang|la|Septimanae Latinae Europaeae}} (''European Latin Weeks'') published a text book named {{lang|la|Piper Salve}} that contains dialogues in modern everyday Latin.&lt;ref name="septimanalatina.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Maier |url=http://www.septimanalatina.org/ |title=Septimanae Latinae Europaeae |website=Septimanalatina.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the {{lang|la|[[Accademia Vivarium Novum]]}} located in Rome, Italy, all classes are taught by faculty fluent in Latin or Ancient Greek, and resident students speak in Latin or Greek at all times outside class. Most students are supported by scholarships from the Mnemosyne foundation and spend one or two years in residence to acquire fluency in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vivariumnovum.net/eng/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116232817/http://www.vivariumnovum.net/eng/index.htm |archivedate=16 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The living Latin movement eventually crossed the Atlantic, where it continues to grow. In the summer of 1996, at the [[University of Kentucky]], Prof. [[Terence Tunberg]] established the first Conventiculum, an immersion conference in which participants from all over the world meet annually to exercise the active use of Latin to discuss books and literature, and topics related to everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mcl.as.uky.edu/conventiculum-latinum |title=Conventiculum Latinum &amp;#124; Modern &amp; Classical Languages, Literatures &amp; Cultures |website=Mcl.as.uky.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the Conventiculum Lexintoniense has inspired similar conferences throughout the United States.

In October 1996 the {{lang|la|[[Septentrionale Americanum Latinitatis Vivæ Institutum]]}} (SALVI, or North American Institute for Living Latin Studies) was founded in Los Angeles, by a group of professors and students of Latin literature concerned about the long-term future of classical studies in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latin.org/about.php |title=About Us &amp;#124; SALVI: Septentrionale Americanum Latinitatis Vivae Institutum |website=Latin.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[University of Kentucky]], Prof. [[Terence Tunberg]] founded the {{lang|la|Institutum Studiis Latinis Provehendis}} (known in English as the Institute of Latin Studies), which awards Graduate Certificates in Latin Studies addressed at those with a special interest gaining "a thorough command of the Latin language in reading, writing and speaking, along with a wide exposure to the cultural riches of the Latin tradition in its totality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mcl.as.uky.edu/latin-institute |title=Graduate Certificate in Latin Studies – Institute for Latin Studies &amp;#124; Modern &amp; Classical Languages, Literatures &amp; Cultures |website=Mcl.as.uky.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only degree-conferring program in the world with courses taught entirely in Latin.

There is also a proliferation of Latin-speaking institutions, groups and conferences in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and in Latin America. Some prominent examples of this tendency towards the active use of Latin within Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries are the annual conferences called Jornadas de Culturaclasica.com, held in different cities of southern Spain, as well as the CAELVM ({{lang|la|Cursus Aestivus Latinitatis Vivae Matritensis}}), a Latin summer program in Madrid. In 2012, the {{lang|la|[[Studium Angelopolitanum]]}} was founded in Puebla, Mexico, by Prof. [[Alexis Hellmer]], in order to promote the study of Latin in that country, where only one university grants a degree in Classics.

Most of these groups and institutions organise seminars and conferences where Latin is used as a spoken language, both throughout the year and over the summer, in Europe and in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lvpa.de/html/latinus.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101110405/http://www.lvpa.de/html/latinus.htm |archivedate=1 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less academic summer encounters wholly carried out in Latin are the ones known as {{lang|la|Septimanæ Latinæ Europææ}} (European Latin Weeks), celebrated in Germany and attracting people of various ages from all over Europe.&lt;ref name="septimanalatina.org"/&gt;

At the present time, several periodicals and social networking web sites are published in Latin. In France, immediately after the conference at Avignon, the publisher {{lang|fr|Théodore Aubanel}} launched the magazine {{lang|la|Vita Latina}}, which still exists, associated to the CERCAM ({{lang|fr|Centre d'Étude et de Recherche sur les Civilisations Antiques de la Méditerranée}}) of the [[Paul Valéry University, Montpellier III]]. Until very recently, it was published in Latin in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recherche.univ-montp3.fr/cercam/article.php3?id_article=131 |title=UPVM &amp;#124; Accueil |language=fr |website=Recherche.univ-montp3.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the magazine {{lang|la|Vox Latina}} was founded in 1965 by Caelestis Eichenseer (1924–2008) and is to this day published wholly in Latin four times a year in the [[University of Saarbrücken]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxlatina.uni-saarland.de/ |title=Vox latina |website=Voxlatina.uni-saarland.de |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Belgium, the magazine ''Melissa'' created in 1984 by [[Gaius Licoppe]] is still published six times a year completely in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.me.com/fundatiomelissa/Site/Periodicum.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601024033/http://web.me.com/fundatiomelissa/Site/Periodicum.html |archivedate=1 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Italian startup [[pptArt]] launched its catalogue ({{lang|la|Catalogus}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pptart.net/#!catalogus/c8py]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707004504/http://www.pptart.net/ |date=7 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its registration form for artists ({{lang|la|Specimen ad nomina signanda}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pptart.net/#!specimen/cr1n]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707004504/http://www.pptart.net/ |date=7 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Latin and English.

In 2016 ACEM ([[Enel]] executives' cultural association) organized with [[Luca Desiata]] and Daniel Gallagher the first Business Latin course for managers ({{lang|la|Congressus studiorum – Lingua Latina mercatoria}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Murzio |first=Antonio |title=L'ingegnere che si diverte con le parole latine |url=http://www.lastampa.it/2016/06/22/cultura/lingegnere-che-si-diverte-con-le-parole-latine-cos-nata-la-prima-rivista-con-la-lingua-di-orazio-o0Icr5ZEHYrlmx7CPAdc8N/pagina.html |work=[[La Stampa]] |date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ephemeris.alcuinus.net/cultus.php?id=829 |title=EPHEMERIS.

The government of [[Finland]], during its presidencies of the [[European Union]], issued official newsletters in Latin on top of the official languages of the Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eu2006.fi/NEWS_AND_DOCUMENTS/NEWSLETTERS/EN_GB/NEWSLETTERS/INDEX.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801092006/http://www.eu2006.fi/NEWS_AND_DOCUMENTS/NEWSLETTERS/EN_GB/NEWSLETTERS/INDEX.HTM |archivedate=1 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the Internet===
The emergence of the Internet on a global scale in the 1990s provided a great tool for the flourishing of communication in Latin, and in February 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.alcuinus.net/GLL/victorius.htm |title=Victorius Ciarrocchi: De Grege Latine loquentium deque linguae Latinae praestantia |website=Alcuinus.net |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Polish Latinist from Warsaw (Poland), Konrad M. Kokoszkiewicz, founded what is still today the most populated and successful Latin-only [[email list]] on the Internet, the {{ill|Grex Latine Loquentium|la|Grex Latine Loquentium|vertical-align=sup}}. Subsequently, the [[Nuntii Latini]] of [[YLE]] Radio 1 would also create a discussion list called ''YLE Colloquia Latina''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chat.yle.fi/latini/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324211501/http://chat.yle.fi/latini/ |archivedate=24 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Circulus Latinus Panormitanus of [[Palermo]] (Italy) went a step further creating the first [[online chat]] in Latin called the {{lang|la|Locutorium}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cirlapa.org/locutorium.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127110133/http://www.cirlapa.org/locutorium.htm |archivedate=27 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2003 Konrad M. Kokoszkiewicz published an on-line glossary with his proposals for some computer terms in Latin under the title of {{lang|la|Vocabula computatralia}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obta.uw.edu.pl/~draco/docs/voccomp.html |title=Vocabula computatralia |website=Obta.uw.edu.pl |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet also allows for the preservation of other contemporary Latin dictionaries that have fallen out of print or have never been printed, like the {{lang|la|Latinitas Recens (Speculum)}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latinlexicon.org/latinitas_recens_latine.html |title=Latinitas Recens (Speculum) |website=Latinlexicon.org |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the {{lang|la|Adumbratio Lexici Angli et Latini}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eweb.furman.edu/~dmorgan/lexicon/adumbratio.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405083522/http://eweb.furman.edu/~dmorgan/lexicon/adumbratio.htm |archivedate=5 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ephemeris.alcuinus.net/archi2004/nuntii/eph1/index.php |title=Ephemeris |website=Ephemeris.alcuinus.net |date=26 June 2004 |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; an on-line newspaper {{lang|la|Ephemeris}} was founded once again from Warsaw by {{lang|pl|Stanisław Tekieli}}, and is to this day published wholly in Latin about current affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ephemeris.alcuinus.net/ |title=EPHEMERIS. Nuntii Latini universi |website=Ephemeris.alcuinus.net |date=27 April 2009 |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008 a ''Schola'', (membership 1800) a Latin-only [[social network service]], including a real-time video and/or text chatroom, was founded from London (UK).&lt;ref&gt;[http://schola.ning.com ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630141837/http://schola.ning.com/ |date=30 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Latin [[web portal]]s, websites, and blogs in Latin have developed, like {{lang|la|Lingua Latina Æterna}} from Russia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguaeterna.com |title=Lingua Latina Aeterna :: Latin – a living language &amp;#124; Lingua Latina Aeterna |website=Linguaeterna.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{lang|la|Verba et facta}} from somewhere in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nemo-nusquam.blogspot.com/index.html |title=Verba et Facta |website=Nemo-nusquam.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet also provides tools like Latin spell checkers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latin.drouizig.org |title=COL – Latin Spellchecker (Microsoft Windows) |website=Latin.drouizig.org |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; for contemporary Latin writers, or [[systems of scansion|scansion]] tools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetaexmachina.net |title=latin poetry / text-to-speech |website=Poetaexmachina.net |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; for contemporary Latin poets.

Some websites, such as [[Google Search|Google]] and Facebook, provide Latin as a language option.

There is a [[MUD]] text game in Latin called Labyrinthus Latinus aimed at uniting people interested in the language. The website is shut down but the game is still available at &lt;code&gt;labyrinthus.latinus.imp.ch:3333&lt;/code&gt;. In addition, the video games [[Minecraft]], [[OpenTTD]], and [[The Battle for Wesnoth]] provide Latin as a language option.

There is even a [[Latin Wikipedia]], although discussions are held not only in Latin but in German, English, and other languages as well. Nearly 200 active editors work on the project. There are nearly 100,000 articles on topics ranging from {{ill|ancient Rome|la|Roma Antiqua|vertical-align=sup|display=1}} to {{ill|mathematics|la|Mathematica|vertical-align=sup|display=1}}, {{ill|Tolkien's fiction|la|Legendarium Tolkienianum|vertical-align=sup}}, and {{ill|geography|la|Oceanus Arcticus|vertical-align=sup|display=1}}. Those in particularly good Latin, currently about 10% of the whole, are marked.&lt;ref&gt;As of August 2013, there are 94,777 pages, of which about a third are [[:la:Categoria:Stipulae|marked as stubs]]. Among the [[:la:Vicipaedia:De Latinitate#De bona et de mala Latinitate|pages whose Latin has been assessed]], 9,658 are marked as having good Latin and just over 500 are marked as poor Latin.{{Better source|date=December 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In public spaces===
[[File:Vatican latin atm.jpg|thumb|The ATM with Latin instructions]]
[[File:Wallsend platfom 2 02.jpg|thumb|upright|The signs at [[Wallsend Metro station]] are in English and Latin as a tribute to Wallsend's role as one of the outposts of the Roman empire.]]
Although less so than in previous eras, contemporary Latin has also been used for public notices in public spaces:

The [[Wallsend Metro station]] of the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] has signs in Latin.

The [[Vatican City]] has an [[automated teller machine]] with instructions in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2279/2360283395_08b38b230c.jpg |format=JPG |title=Photographic image of ATM |website=Farm3.static.flickr.com |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original production==
Some contemporary works have been produced originally in Latin, most overwhelmingly poetry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://suberic.net/~marc/latinpoetry.html |title=Contemporary Latin Poetry |website=Suberic.net }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also prose, as well as music or cinema. They include:

'''Covariational Conditional''' refers to the most commonly used "the X'er, the Y'er" structure in [[English language|English]], for example:
* "The more I think about it, the less I understand."
* "The sooner, the better."
The structure is composed of two [[Dependent and independent variables|variables]]: an independent variable ('the X'er') and a dependent variable ("the Y'er").&lt;ref name="LittlemoreTaylor2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeannette Littlemore|author2=John R.

In [[construction grammar]] this pattern is considered a construction because the pattern is not predictable from any other fact of [[English grammar]] already established about 'the'.

'The normally occurs with a head noun but in this construction it requires a comparative phrase. The two major phrases resist classification as either noun phrases or clauses. The requirement that two phrases of this type be juxtaposed is another non-predictable aspect of the pattern. Because the pattern is not strictly predictable, a construction must be
posited that specifies the particular form and function involved' ([[Adele Goldberg (linguist)|Goldberg]] 2006, 6).&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, A. E. (2006). Constructions at Work The nature of generalization in language. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dialectometry''' is the [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[computational linguistics|computational]] branch of [[dialectology]], the study of [[dialect]]. This sub-field of [[linguistics]] studies language variation using the methods of [[statistics]]; it arose in the 1970s and 80s as a result of seminal work by J. Séguy and H. Goebl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dialectometry++ |first1=John |last1=Nerbonne |first2=William A. |last2=Kretzschmar |journal=Literary and Linguistic Computing: J. Digital Scholarship in the Humanities |doi=10.1093/llc/fqs062 |url=http://urd.let.rug.nl/nerbonne/papers/Nerbonne-Kretzschmar-2012-Dec-11.pdf |year=2013 |volume=28 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research concentrates mainly on the regional distribution of dialect similarities, such as cores of dialect and overlapping zones, which can be labelled according to a more or less slight variance of dialect between bordering locations. However, analysis of dialect relationships  cannot always be clearly depicted by [[cladistics]], since there are often [[dialect continuum]] cases and also examples with elements of convergence, as well as division.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Simons. 1977. Recognizing patterns of divergence and convergence in a matrix of lexicostatistic relations. ''Workpapers in Papua New Guinea Languages 21'' 107-134. Ukarumpa, Papua New Guinea: SIL.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language atlases serve as an empirical database which document the dialect profile of a large number of locations in detail. Different well-known numerical classification methodologies are used to abstract and visualise a basic pattern from the immense amount of data found in the language atlases.

Not one solid classification can be expected to result from the calculations; rather, different aspects of the basic pattern being searched for can be discovered by using the different methodologies. Principally speaking, there is more interest in the diversity of the [[Taxonomy (general)|taxometric]] methodologies, the results and the linguistic interpretations which can be made from them.

'''e.tv Ghana''' also known as ETV Ghana is a free-to-air terrestrial television network broadcasting 24-hours a day from Accra since its launch in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.modernghana.com/music/9816/3/etv-ghana-launched.html|title=e.tv Ghana Launched|publisher=[[Modern Ghana]]|date=2009-08-18|accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2011 it will also commence terrestrial transmissions in [[Kumasi]]. Beyond [[Accra]] and [[Kumasi]], it is available via satellite on [[First Digital TV]] and SMART TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myskyyonline.com/tv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=60|title=Skyy TV: e.tv Ghana|publisher=Skyy TV|date=2009-09-10|accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The TV station was born of a partnership between Global Media Alliance (GMA) and Sabido Group, parent company of [[e.tv]], the largest English-medium channel in [[South Africa]]. e.tv Ghana operates under Global Media Alliance’s broadcasting company (GMABC).

Edward Boateng is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and renowned Ghanaian film and TV personality [[Jot Agyeman]] is e.tv Ghana’s Station Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jot-agyeman/32/b3a/a23|title=JOT Agyeman; LinkedIn|publisher=[[LinkedIn]]|date=2010-12-18|accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
e.tv Ghana’s programming falls into six broad categories: entertainment; talkshows; sports; current affairs; drama; and movies. It also broadcasts special major one-off events, children’s programming and comedy shows.

e.tv Ghana has historically invested heavily in local talent and programming and supplements its local content with shows imported from South Africa and the USA. About 30-40% of its prime time programming is locally produced. Its local acquisitions are a mix of in-house shows and co-productions with local production companies. Locally produced shows include Awake, The Be Bold Show,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thebeboldshow.com|title=The Be Bold Show website; Official Website|publisher=[[Official Website]]|date=2010-12-18|accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 100 Degrees, Meet the Girls, The Late Night Celebrity Show and Sports Lounge. South African shows include the hit-soapies [[Rhythm City (TV series)|Rhythm City]] and Scandal! and international imports include [[How I Met Your Mother]] and [[WWE Wrestling]].

==News==
e.tv Ghana has an in-house news production department that focuses on national and business news content for its website and local and international news stories for its television transmissions. The main nightly news programme is called Prime News and is fronted by Gideon Aryeequaye in a 20:00h slot. The main business news programme is fronted by Christal Jeanne and is called eBusiness Journal, airing prior to Prime News at 19:30h.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theghanaianjournal.com/2010/08/28/christal-jeanne/|title=Christal Jeanne; The Ghanaian Journal|publisher=[[The Ghanaian Journal]]|date=2010-08-28|accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Political Economy in anthropology}}
'''''Europe and the People Without History''''' is a book by [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Eric Wolf]].  First published in 1982, it focuses on the expansion of European [[society|societies]] in the [[Modern Era]]. "Europe and the people without history" is history written on a global scale, tracing the connections between communities, regions, peoples and nations that are usually treated as discrete subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A global history==
The book begins in 1400 with a description of the trade routes a world traveller might have encountered, the people and societies they connected, and the civilizational processes trying to incorporate them. From this, Wolf traces the emergence of Europe as a global power, and the reorganization of particular world regions for the production of goods now meant for global consumption. Wolf differs from [[World-systems theory|World Systems theory]] in that he sees the growth of Europe until the late eighteenth century operating in a tributary framework, and not capitalism. He examines the way that colonial state structures were created to protect tributary populations involved in the silver, [[Fur trade in North America|fur]] and [[Slave trade in Africa|slave trades]].  Whole new "tribes" were created as they were incorporated into circuits of mercantile accumulation. The final section of the book deals with the transformation in these global networks as a result of the growth of capitalism with the industrial revolution. Factory production of textiles in England, for example transformed cotton production in the American south and Egypt, and eliminated textile production in India. All these transformations are connected in a single structural change. Each of the world's regions are examined in terms of the goods they produced in the global division of labour, as well as the mobilization and migration of whole populations (such as African slaves) to produce these goods. Wolf uses [[labor market segmentation]] to provide a historical account of the creation of ethnic segmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=127–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where World Systems theory had little to say about the periphery, Wolf's emphasis is on the people "without history" (i.e. not given a voice in western histories) and on how they were active participants in the creation of new cultural and social forms emerging in the context of commercial empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mode of production analysis==
Wolf distinguishes between three modes of production: capitalist, kin-ordered, and tributary. Wolf does not view them as an evolutionary sequence. He begins with capitalism because he argues our understanding of kin-ordered and tributary modes is coloured by our understanding of capitalism. He argues they are not evolutionary precursors of capitalism, but the product of the encounter between the West and the Rest. In the tributary mode, direct producers possess their own means of production, but their surplus production is taken from them through extra economic means. This appropriation is usually by some form of strong or weak state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=131–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the kin-ordered mode of production, social labour is mobilized through kin relations (such as lineages), although his description makes its exact relations with tributary and capitalist modes unclear. The kin mode was further theorized by French structuralist Marxists in terms of 'articulated modes of production.' The kin-ordered mode is distinct again from Sahlins' formulation of the domestic mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''family entertainment center''' (or '''centre'''), often abbreviated '''FEC''' in the entertainment industry&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stonecreekllc.com/family-entertainment-centers.html |title=About Family Entertainment Centers |author=-&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by line.--&gt; |publisher=StoneCreek Partners Advisory Services, Commercial Real Estate and Leisure-time Industries |location=Las Vegas, Nevada |work=StoneCreekLLC.com |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as an '''indoor amusement park''' or '''indoor theme park'''), is a small [[amusement park]] marketed towards families with small children to teenagers, and often entirely indoors or associated with a larger operation such as a [[theme park]]. They usually cater to "sub-regional markets of larger metropolitan areas."&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; FECs are generally small compared to full-scale amusement parks, with fewer attractions, a lower per-person per-hour cost to consumers than a traditional amusement park, and not usually major tourist attractions, but sustained by an area customer base. Many are locally owned and operated, although there are a number of chains and franchises in the field.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  FECs are sometimes called '''family amusement centers''', '''play zones''', '''family fun centers''', or simply '''fun centers'''. Some non-traditional FECs, called '''urban entertainment centers''' ('''UEC'''s), with more customized and branded attractions and retail outlets, are associated with major entertainment companies and may be tourist destinations.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=  |title=Urban Entertainment Centers |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=StoneCreekLLC.com |publisher=''op. cit'' |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, sometimes operated by [[Non-Profit]] organizations as [[Children's Museums]] or [[science museum|Science Centers]], tend to be geared toward [[edutainment]] experiences rather than simply amusement.  FECs may also be adjuncts to full-scale amusement parks.

==History==
FECs are essentially a converged outgrowth of [[theme restaurant]]s that increasingly developed their in-house amusement features, small-scale amusement parks needing more offerings than just a few rides and [[midway (fair)|midway]] games, and diversifying formerly one-attraction venues ([[water park]]s, [[skate park]]s, [[billiard hall]]s, [[bowling alley]]s, and so on).  All three categories have moved over several decades continually toward stock, popular entertainment solutions supplied by third-party vendors.  Among the earliest of the themed restaurants to become known more for family entertainment than food was [[Chuck E. Cheese's]], a pizza restaurant founded in 1977 in [[San Jose, California]].&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Attractions==
[[Image:Baby in ball pit.jpg|thumb|right|Ball pits are a popular attraction at family fun centers.]]Most FECs have at least five common major or "anchor" attractions, to provide diverse patrons (often in large parties) at least one to two hours of entertainment, to encourage repeat visits, and to reduce time spent waiting for any given attraction.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  Some of the more usual attractions include (depending upon size, climate, etc.):
{{div col |colwidth=30em}}
*[[Amusement ride|Amusement/thrill rides]] (elevated, but generally small-scale)
*[[Arcade games]]
*[[Ball pit]]
*[[Batting cage]]s
*[[Bowling alley]]
*[[Bumper boats]]
*[[Restaurant]]
*Food: [[Snack bar]] and [[fast food]] (especially [[pizza]])
*Food: Quality family and group dining in [[theme restaurant]]
*[[Inflatable castle|Inflatables]]
*[[Kiddie ride]]s (ground-level)
*[[Kart racing]]
*[[Laser tag]]
*[[Miniature golf]]
*[[Movie theater]]
*[[Music]] and [[dancing]]
*[[Playground]] equipment and climbing structures
*[[Redemption game]]s and [[merchandiser]] games
*[[Roller skating]]
*[[retail|Specialty shops]] (toys, comics, music, etc.)
*[[Virtual reality]]
*[[Water slide]]
{{div col end}}
[[Image:Playport Indoor Playarea.png|thumb|right|Multi-tiered climbing structures such as this one are common at family entertainment centers.]]
The most common anchor activities are miniature golf, kart racing, arcade and redemption games, and food &amp; beverage, according to industry specialists StoneCreek Partners.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  FECs rarely use custom-built attractions, because of the costs involved, and instead install off-the-shelf systems provided and maintained by industry equipment vendors.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Any given FEC may lean more towards outdoor activities, arcade gaming, or passive entertainment and dining. Each may cater to different age ranges, all the time, or during certain hours, e.g. children and entire families in the daytime, and teens to young adults in the evening, with specific promotional programs to attract different market segments at different times.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Business model==
FECs tend to serve "sub-regional markets",&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; such as small cities, quadrants or boroughs of larger cities, and a large suburban area outside such a city.  Their busiest times are weekend afternoons and Thursday through Saturday evenings.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Because most of the attractions are essentially the same from FEC to FEC,&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; two of the most important factors in a particular center distinguishing itself to potential customers are a highly visible location&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; (hard to obtain because other uses for the land are often more competitive&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;), and a consistently developed and promoted theme that appeals to the target market segments, "the fun factor in the overall decor".&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Parental concerns are also important. While children themselves rarely think of it, a major factor in the attractiveness of an FEC to parents is on-site safety and security, as adults may drop off older children at such an establishment to entertain themselves.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  An increasingly important factor for success is high-quality food and drink to attract parental spending as well as whole-family dining.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Non-traditional FECs==
Various major media and entertainment brands, including [[Disney]], [[Lego]], [[NASCAR]], [[Sega]], [[Sony]], [[Regal Entertainment Group|United Artists/Regal]] and [[Viacom]], have been attached to family entertainment centers, often much less "traditional" than local and chain FECs, with custom-built, unique attractions, usually heavily branded, and most often located in major metropolitan areas.  The first such '''urban entertainment center''' (UEC) was the [[Universal CityWalk]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], which opened in 1993, linking several Universal properties.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2" /&gt; Including various retail outlets, restaurants, and attractions, the CityWalk created a great deal of "sustained buzz" in the retail real estate industry, which began "embracing the notion that Universal Studios, Sony, Disney, and other entertainment companies could create new anchors and entertainment programs for shopping centers".&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2" /&gt; Another significant UEC was the [[Sony Metreon]] in [[San Francisco, California]] (1999&amp;ndash;2006).

Some nonprofit, educational installations, such as the [[Exploratorium]] in San Francisco, also have aspects of FECs in format and atmosphere, but with activities geared toward learning and experiencing rather than simple entertainment. Some for-profit enterprises also use this model, or mix [[edutainment]] with simpler amusement attractions.

==Industry organizations==
The major international industry association that supports FECs is the [http://www.iaapa.org International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions] (IAAPA), which merged with and absorbed the membership of the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry (IALEI) in October 2009.&lt;ref name="IAPPA 1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaapa.org/pressroom/pressreleases/IALEIDissolutionIAAPAMergerPlansFinalRelease.asp |title=News Release: IALEI Dissolution IAAPA Merger Plans Final |first=David |last=Mandt |work=IAAPA.org |publisher=International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions |location=Alexandria, Virginia |date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IAAPA maintains addresses in the [[Virginia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Brussels, Belgium]] and [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="IAAPA 2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaapa.org/aboutus/ContactUs.asp |title=Contact Us |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=IAPPA.org |publisher=''op. cit'' |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Laser Tag Association (ILTA) also remains active (and more broadly than its name suggests).  ILTA is based in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], U.S.&lt;ref name="ILTA 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lasertag.org/about-us.html |title=About Us |author= |work=LaserTag.org |year=2011 |publisher=International Laser Tag Association |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603212344/http://lasertag.org/about-us.html |archivedate=June 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many smaller, community centric FEC's and owner/operators who can't always make the IAAPA tradeshow, IAAO the International Association of Amusement Operators [https://web.archive.org/web/20111219122923/http://www.amusementoperators.org/] is an online resource for family entertainment center operators and startups.

==In Canada==
Canadian FECs are called "family entertainment centres" or "fun centres", due to [[British English|British]]-style spelling conventions in [[Canadian English]].
*[[Chuck E. Cheese's]] (U.S.-owned)
*[[Playdium]]

==In Mexico==
*[[KidZania]] (Mexico City, 1999)
*[[America's Incredible Pizza Company]] (Monterrey, U.S.-owned)

==In the United States==
The main national industry group in the U.S. is the [[National_Association_of_Family_Entertainment_Centers|National Association of Family Entertainment Centers (NAFEC)]], which is perhaps incongruously a division of the International Laser Tag Association (ILTA).

Some U.S.-based companies also have venues in Canada (noted above), but this is rare due to the legal/political difficulties involved in cross-border corporations.

American FECs vary wildly in themes, size and features. Some of the larger businesses in this category have included:&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;&lt;!--Sources some but not all of this list, especially many of the dates and places. IT MUST BE CITED WHERE IT *DOES* SOURCE THE MATERIAL, not just at the top of the list! --&gt;

'''Georgiana Morson''' served as a matron for Urania Cottage, a house for fallen women founded by [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts|Angela Burdett-Coutts]], as well as the [[Foundling Hospital]] during the mid-nineteenth century. 

== Personal life ==
Georgiana Morson was born Georgiana Collin in Merton. She married James Morson, a doctor for [[St George's Hospital]], in 1838. Shortly after their marriage, James Morson was appointed as Chief Medical Officer for the [[Brazilian National Mining Association]]. He died in 1848, leaving Georgiana with three children to provide for by her own efforts.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/DICmorsonG.htm|title=Georgiana Morson|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, Morson would resign from her post as matron of Urania Cottage in order to marry George Wade Harrison, a printer and bookseller, and they settled in [[Sevenoaks]].

== Urania Cottage ==

On 26 May 1846, Dickens wrote Burdett-Coutts a lengthy letter stating his desire to open an asylum for girls and women working in London's streets as prostitutes. The letter included planning for the asylum ranging from finding a property in London to a detailed process of rehabilitating fallen women. For example, Dickens suggests introducing a marks system and probationary period for asylum residents. He writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is explained to her that she is degraded and fallen, but not lost, having this shelter; and that the means of Return to Happiness are now about to be put into her own hands, and trusted to her own keeping. That with this view, she is, instead of being placed in this probationary class for a month, or two months, or three months, or any specified time whatever, required to earn there, a certain number of Marks (they are mere scratches in a book) so that she may make her probation a very short one, or a very long one, according to her own conduct. For so much work, she has so many Marks; for a day's good conduct, so many more. For every instance of ill-temper, disrespect, bad language, any outbreak of any sort or kind, so many - a very large number in proportion to her receipts - are deducted. A perfect Debtor and Creditor account is kept between her and the Superintendent, for every day; and the state of that account, it is in her own power and nobody else's, to adjust to her advantage. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/DICurania.htm|title=Urania Cottage|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dickens located a home for the asylum originally named Urania Cottage in Shepherds Bush, Middlesex in 1847. He worked closely with Burdett-Coutts in the asylum founding and administration, regularly attending meetings and writing about the home in his journal, ''[[All the Year Round]]''.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coutts, Angela Georgina Burdett-, suo jure Baroness Burdett-Coutts (1814–1906), philanthropist|last=Healey|first=Edna|date=2004-09-23|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/32175}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Opening to residents in November 1847, the institution provided food, shelter, and a detailed daily routine for the residents. Residents learned to read and write, worked in the garden, completed all household tasks including needlework, attended singing lessons, and cooked food for local poor relief.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Georgiana Morson served as a dedicated matron of Urania Cottage from 1849 to 1854. In her book, ''Charles Dickens and the House of Fallen Women'' (2009), Jenny Hartley describes how, "Georgiana Morson proved herself the best matron Urania ever had... she taught the girls to read and write, as well as all the household skills a servant needed. She presided over the dining table, and made mealtimes a social occasion the girls had not known before. They ate the good food she had taught them to cook and chattered about their future prospects." &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

Dickens praised Morson's oversight at Urania Cottage in a letter recommending her as matron for the Foundling Hospital in 1852. Writing to the governors of the hospital on 9 July 1852, Dickens describes her "capacity for the administration of such an office."&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dickensletters.com/letters/governors-foundling-hospital-9-july-1852|title=To the Governors of the Foundling Hospital, 9 July 1852|last=Ben|date=2018-06-03|website=www.dickensletters.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to explain that:&lt;blockquote&gt;She is a lady of great discretion, of remarkable sweetness of temper, and has a power of uniting firmness with conciliation in a very remarkable and uncommon manner. I have never known her to make a mistake even under circumstances of great difficulty, and I have invariably found that those under her care have become attached to her. She is accustomed to method, order, punctuality, and to a habit of sound and judicious observation. I would entrust her, myself, with the duties to which she now aspires, in preference to any lady I have ever seen in a similar capacity.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Gun cultures''' are found around the world, and evidence various attitudes towards guns in such places as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Israel]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Switzerland]], [[Yemen]] and [[Pakistan]]. Among the most studied and discussed global gun cultures is that of the [[gun culture in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fisher |first=Max |date=December 15, 2012 |title=What makes America's gun culture totally unique in the world, in four charts |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/15/what-makes-americas-gun-culture-totally-unique-in-the-world-as-demonstrated-in-four-charts/ |newspaper=Washington Post |location=Washington D.C. |publisher= |accessdate=January 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
{{See also|Gun politics in Canada|Shooting sports in Canada}}
Like British gun culture, Canadian gun culture is also largely represented by sport-shooting and hunting and less on self-defense. Sport-shooting has always been a popular activity for both gun-owners and non-gun-owners in Canada. It is also a bridge and a leeway between American and British attitudes towards firearms. The provinces of [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]] and [[Alberta]] have large populations of hunters and shooters.

The [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] over the recent years, has been protective of the sport-shooting community, passing many bills that cater to their needs. In 2012, Bill C-19 eliminated the need to register "non-restricted" firearms (shotguns and regular rifles). In 2015, Bill C-42 converted "Possession-Only" licences to a regular firearms licence or a "Possession and Acquisition Licence", as well as the right to transport firearms to a shooting range without having to notify a [[chief firearms officer]].

Most Canadians who own firearms use them for hunting or sport-shooting. Canadians have mixed opinions about using firearms for self-defence, and the legality of self-defence in Canada has been a subject of controversy and debate. After the incident of Ian Thomson, a gun owner who was arrested under murder and storage violations for shooting intruders with a firearm, the Canadian parliament amended the Criminal Code to make use of force legal. This finally made it legal for gun owners to use their firearms for self-defence, as technically "anything" within their disposal can be legally used - including firearms themselves. Canadians opposed to the use of firearms for personal protection argue that it is purely an American tradition. Yet despite the Criminal Code amendments, the firearms storage laws still make it rather difficult for citizens to use their firearms for home defence in a situation. In addition, it is still up the Courts to decide whether the use of force was "justifiable".

Due to Canada's proximity and close history and cultural ties with the United States, the cultural and socio-political environment surrounding firearms has recently begun to emulate American attitudes, where those who oppose stricter gun laws as well as the right to use guns for personal protection, tend to vote for the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] as well as other right-leaning groups. Those who support stricter gun laws and are opposed to legalizing the use of firearms for self-defence tend to vote for the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]], [[New Democratic Party]] or other liberal and left-leaning groups in the country.

Although a "[[right to bear arms]]" is never explicitly stated in Canada's Charters of Freedom and Rights, conservative-leaning gun owners claim that a right to bear arms is present within the layers of Canada and Britain's historical documents.

There are many organizations in Canada meant at protecting sport-shooting and firearms ownership, these include the [[National Firearms Association]] (NFA) and the Canadian Shooting Sports Association (CSSA). Out of the two, the NFA advocates self-defence with a firearm and has recently begun to emulate the [[National Rifle Association|American NRA]].

==Czech Republic==
{{See also|Gun laws in the Czech Republic}}
The Czech Republic gun culture is unique, as it has relatively low firearm ownership per capita, but allows gun ownership for personal protection on shall issue basis, including concealed carry permits. Around 80% of Czech 300,000 gun owners have an E category license, for personal protection. The reason for this is Czech history of being occupied by foreign powers, Nazi Germany and Soviet Union, who did not allow most citizens to own guns. Liberal gun laws are also traditional in Czech lands, starting with Imperial regulation No. 223 in 1852, which was used during the time of [[First Czechoslovak Republic]]. After the [[Velvet Revolution]] in 1989, the law was liberalized in 1995, when legal right to own firearms was restored, and further in 2002, when many other types of firearms were legalized prior to Czech accession to EU, which required the law to be compatible with the [[European Firearms Directive]].

There are 2 major organizations advocating for legal gun ownership, Lex - sdružení na ochranu práv majitelů zbraní&lt;ref&gt;https://gunlex.cz/&lt;/ref&gt;, and Petice proti nesmyslným zákazům legálních zbraní - LIGA LIBE &lt;ref&gt;https://www.peticezbrane.cz/cs/?popup=1&lt;/ref&gt;, which was formed by a team behind a petition against the European Firearms Directive, founded in 2014.

==Israel==
Due to the history of [[Israel]] and the many wars it has fought, Israeli society has emphasized the need to be armed and well-trained. Amid the days leading up to Israel's creation, many Jewish paramilitary groups operated in Israel to protect their [[kibbutzim]] from Arab militants. These various groups would eventually merge to form the modern-day [[Israel Defense Forces]]. During the [[Second Intifada|2002 Intifada]], guns were a common sight as civilians needed to protect themselves.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-06-29/what-americans-could-learn-from-israel-s-gun-culture&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of Israeli gun culture is vested within the military and associated with serving in some armed service rather than a fringe militia. Men and women over the age of 18 (with exceptions), are required to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. As part of the terms of their service, Israeli soldiers are allowed to carry their firearms, on or off-duty, in uniform or without the uniform.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Israeli civilians who carry and own firearms are mostly [[Israeli settler|settler]]s in the [[West Bank]] region.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Though on the other hand, Israeli gun laws are actually strict. A civilian would need to apply for a gun license, and demonstrate a need to own a firearm. Therefore, it is rather difficult for an average civilian to attain a firearms license, unless he/she lives in an area proven to be dangerous, or has the necessary military experience required by Israeli law.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Pakistan==
{{See also|Gun politics in Pakistan|Culture of Pakistan}}
Gun ownership, especially in the mountainous [[Northwest Pakistan|northwest]], is part of traditional Pakistani culture. Rifles are handed down from generation to generation for hunting and for [[celebratory fire]]. In the 21st century, increases in terrorist threats, and particularly in urban kidnappings, extortions, and robberies, has led to an increase in civilian demand for guns for self-protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wonacott |first=Peter |date=January 6, 2009 |title=For Middle-Class Pakistanis, a Gun Is a Must-Have Accessory: With Kidnappings and Violence on the Rise, Demand for Weapons Permits Grows |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB123120431026355961 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location= |publisher= |accessdate=January 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
Russia also has a unique firearms culture, though that culture is dedicated heavily towards military use rather than to civilian ownership and much of it originates from the Soviet Union (paradoxically an era of strict gun control) and their war against [[Nazi Germany]]. Russia prides itself in having produced some of the world's most famous firearms, most notably the [[AK-47]] and [[PPSh-41]]. During the days of the [[Russian Empire]], many people living in the [[Ural Mountains]] owned firearms for hunting and training and at one point, Russia had a very high civilian firearms ownership rate.

During [[World War II]], and the years building up to it, saw a surge in firearms culture in the Soviet Union. Rifle-training and marksmanship was seen as a symbol of fighting honor for the Soviet motherland, and later were a source of influence for sniping schools in the United States. During the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], the city's fate also relied on local militias. Firearms were also part of military propaganda, such as in the case of the famous Soviet sniper [[Vasily Zaytsev]]. Soviet snipers were essential and important to the Soviet strategy against the German invasion.

Today, the legacy of Russian weaponry is very popular with firearms enthusiasts in the United States and the world, and are some of the most discussed firearms by historians.

The emergence of the [[AK-47]] as one of the world's most popular battle rifles has presented a stereotype of Russians as wielding AK-47s and having a gun culture similar to America. However, the reality of the situation presents the opposite, according to a survey done by the Zircon public opinion research group, over 70% of Russians were opposed to the right to bear arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Iván Ivánnikov, special to RBTH |url=http://rbth.com/society/2013/04/03/russian_public_has_no_problem_with_gun_laws_24581.html |title=Russian public has no problem with gun laws &amp;#124; Russia Beyond The Headlines |publisher=Rbth.com |date=2013-04-03 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Switzerland==
{{See also|Gun politics in Switzerland}}
Males with ages between 18 and 30 are conscripted and can choose to do the military service and – as part of that – can keep their firearms at home.

The SAT (lit. shooting and off-duty activities) oversees lessons in which every Swiss kid in the year of their 15th anniversary to the year of their 20th or the one in which they begin their conscription can learn how to shoot with the [[SIG SG 550]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20030864/index.html#a15 |title=SR 512.31 Verordnung über das Schiesswesen ausser Dienst (Schiessverordnung) |publisher=The Swiss Federal Council |location=Berne, Switzerland |type=official site |language=de, fr, it |date=1 January 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity is free and the Young Shooters are able to take home the rifle in-between the lessons if they are 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20081148/index.html#a23 |title=SR 514.541 Verordnung über Waffen, Waffenzubehör und Munition (Waffenverordnung, WV) |publisher=The Swiss Federal Council |location=Berne, Switzerland |type=official site |language=de, fr, it |date=1 July 2016 |accessdate=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though for obvious security reasons, the breach has to stay at the range in which they attend the lesson. This activity takes place over a span of 6 years by a 3~4 months period a year and, if wanted, they can pursue and become instructors for the new generation of Young Shooters.

Switzerland holds the biggest gun-fest in the world: the ''Eidgenössisches Feldschiessen''. This competition takes place annually and in 2012 they counted 130,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lebendige-traditionen.ch/traditionen/00234/index.html?lang=en |title=Feldschiessen |publisher=Lebendige Traditionen |accessdate=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every Swiss who's 10 or older can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissshooting.ch/Portaldata/1/Resources/dokumente/reglemente/gewehr300m/efs/3_10_01_d_EFS_Regl_2016.pdf |title=Reglement über das Eidgenössische Feldschiessen |publisher=SCHWEIZER SCHIESSSPORTVERBAND SSV, |date=2016 |accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guns are widely used for competition in sport-shooting.

==United Kingdom==
{{See also|Gun politics in the United Kingdom|Culture of the United Kingdom}}
The U.K. gun culture is represented by shooting sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://basc.org.uk/ |title=The British Association for Shooting &amp; Conservation |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=BASC |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clay-pigeon shooting]] is one of the more popular sports. Firearms are very popular predominantly among the rural communities. However outside of the rural areas, the society is overwhelmingly anti-gun, and many anti-gun advocates come from Britain.

The use of firearms for self-defence, even among leaders of the sport-shooting community is generally frowned upon, with the exception of [[Northern Ireland]], where guns are legal for self-defence. Even the use of firearms by local police officers is frowned upon; police officers in the country are not typically equipped with firearms, only special units of law enforcement (the [[firearms unit]]s) do so.

The main sport-shooting organization in the United Kingdom is the [[National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom|National Rifle Association]] (not to be confused for, and is not in any way, related to the [[National Rifle Association|American organization]] of the same name).

==United States of America==
{{See also|Gun culture in the United States|Culture of the United States}}
Gun ownership in the United States is constitutionally protected by the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Firearms are widely used in the United States of America for self-defense, [[hunting]], and recreational uses, such as [[target shooting]].  [[Gun politics in the United States|Gun politics]] is polarized between advocates of [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]], typically conservative, and those who support stricter [[gun control]], usually liberal. The gun culture of the United States can be considered unique among developed countries, in terms of the large number of firearms owned by civilians and generally permissive regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fisher |first=Max |date=December 15, 2012 |title=What makes America's gun culture totally unique in the world, in four charts |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/15/what-makes-americas-gun-culture-totally-unique-in-the-world-as-demonstrated-in-four-charts/ |newspaper=Washington Post |location=Washington D.C. |publisher= |accessdate=January 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yemen==
Yemen's gun culture is very similar to that of Pakistan's, in that firearms ownership is not only used for self-defense, but also used in [[celebratory fire]]. Guns also had a higher demand after the [[2011 Yemeni uprising|2011 uprisings]] and other political insecurities throughout the country. Owning a firearm in Yemen is seen in a positive light, as society views it as a symbol of manhood and leadership. Tribesman even carry their firearms to mediate disputes between other tribal leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1683/culture/2463/Yemen%E2%80%99s-culture-of-weapons.htm|title=Yemen’s culture of weapons|work=Yemen Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{Nihongo|'''''Hansei'''''|反省||"self-reflection"}} is a central idea in [[Japan]]ese culture, meaning to acknowledge one's own mistake and to pledge improvement. This is similar to the German proverb ''Selbsterkenntnis ist der erste Schritt zur Besserung,'' where the closest translation to English would be "Self-awareness is the first step to improvement".

==Cultural meaning==
In the ''hansei'' process, the emphasis is on what went wrong and on creating clear plans for ensuring that it does not reoccur; this is done constantly and consistently. At [[Toyota]], even if you do a project successfully, there is still a ''hansei-kai'' (reflection meeting) to review what went wrong. If a manager or engineer claims that there were not any problems with the project, they will be reminded that “no problem is a problem” – in other words, you have not objectively and [[Critical thinking|critically]] evaluated the project to find opportunities for improvement. No problems indicate that you did not stretch to meet (or exceed) your expected capacity.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Cultural examples==
An example would be the actions of Japanese politicians involved in corruption. They apologize publicly for the inappropriate action, then remove themselves from public politics for a few years. They resume their career after a culturally accepted period of time where they learned their lesson.

In Japanese companies it is common practice for a manager to expect ''hansei'' from his subordinates in case of mistakes. The manager will publicly take the blame, while the department works on solving the problem.

==Other use==  
Hansei also incorporates the concept of greeting success with modesty and [[humility]]. To stop ''hansei,'' means to stop learning. With ''hansei,'' one never becomes convinced of one's own [[Superiority complex|superiority]], and feels that there is always more room, or need, for further improvement.

A '''hierarchy of genres''' is any formalization which ranks different  [[genre]]s in an art form in terms of their prestige and cultural value.

In literature, the [[Epic poetry|epic]] was considered the highest form, for the reason expressed by [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''Life of [[John Milton]]'': "By the general consent of criticks, the first praise of genius is due to the writer of an epick poem, as it requires an assemblage of all the powers which are singly sufficient for other compositions."  Below that came [[lyric poetry]], and comic poetry, with a similar ranking for [[drama]]. The [[novel]] took a long time to establish a firm place in the hierarchy, doing so only as belief in any systematic hierarchy of forms expired in the 19th century.

In music, settings of words were accorded a higher status than merely instrumental works, at least until the [[Baroque]] period, and [[opera]] retained a superior status for much longer.  The status of works also varies with the number of players and singers involved, with those for large forces, which are certainly more difficult to write and more expensive to perform, given higher status. Any element of comedy reduced the status of a work, though, as in other art forms, often increasing its popularity.

The hierarchies in figurative art are those initially formulated for painting in 16th-century Italy, which held sway with little alteration until the early 19th century.  These were formalized and promoted by the [[Academy|academies]] in Europe between the 17th century and the modern era, of which the most influential became the French [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]], which held a central role in [[Academic art]].  The fully developed hierarchy distinguished between:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Belton|first1=Dr. Robert J.|title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook|chapter=The Elements of Art|date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[History painting]], including historically important, religious, mythological, or allegorical subjects
*[[Portrait painting]]
*[[Genre works|Genre painting]] or scenes of everyday life
*[[landscape art|Landscape]] and cityscape art (landscapists were called "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" by the Dutch theorist [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]])
*[[Animal painting]]
*[[Still life]]

The hierarchy was based on a distinction between art that made an intellectual effort to "render visible the universal essence of things" (''imitare'' in Italian) and that which merely consisted of "mechanical copying of particular appearances" (''ritrarre'').&lt;ref&gt;Bass, 36 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6TSDvkud168C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Hierarchy+of+genres+painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Idealism]] was privileged over [[Philosophical realism|realism]] in line with [[Renaissance Neo-Platonist]] philosophy.

The term is mostly used within the field of painting, and from the [[High Renaissance]] onwards, by which time painting had asserted itself as the highest form of art.  This had not been the case in [[Medieval art]] and the art-commissioning sectors of society took a considerable period to fully accept this view.  The [[Raphael Cartoons]] are a clear example of the continuing status of [[tapestry]], the most expensive form of art in the 16th century.  In the Early Medieval period lavish pieces of metalwork had typically been the most highly regarded, and valuable materials remained an important ingredient in the appreciation of art until at least the 17th century.  Until the 19th century the most extravagant [[objets d'art]] remained more expensive, both new and on the art market, than all but a few paintings.  Classical writings which valued the supreme skills of individual artists were influential, as well as developments in art which allowed the Renaissance artist to demonstrate their skill and invention to a greater degree than was usually possible in the Middle Ages.

==Renaissance art==
The hierarchy grew out of the struggle  to gain acceptance of painting as one of the [[Liberal arts]], and then controversies to establish an equal or superior status within them with [[architecture]] and [[sculpture]].  These matters were considered of great importance by artist-theorists such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Giorgio Vasari]].  Against the sculptors, Leonardo argued that the intellectual effort necessary to create an illusion of three-dimensionality made the painters' art superior to that of the sculptor, who could do so merely by recording appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 28, 53-4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[De Pictura]]'' ("About Painting") of 1441, Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer.  He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 11-12,&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists of the Early and High Renaissance accepted the importance of representing nature closely, at least until the later writings of [[Michelangelo]], who was strongly influenced by [[neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 61, 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of [[Mannerist]] theorists such as [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]] and [[Federico Zuccari]] (both also painters) this was far less of a priority.  Both emphasized beauty as "something which was directly infused into the mind of man from the mind of God, and existed there independent of any sense-impressions", a view bound to further reduce the status of works depending on realism.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 140-141 (quote, 141)&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice the hierarchy represented little break with either medieval and classical thought, except to place secular history painting in the same class as religious art, and to distinguish (not always clearly) between static iconic religious subjects and narrative figure scenes, giving the latter a higher status.  Ideas of [[decorum]] also fed into the hierarchy; comic, sordid or merely frivolous subjects or treatment ranked lower than elevated and moral ones.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

During the Renaissance landscape, genre scenes and still lifes hardly existed as established genres, so discussion of the status or importance of different types of painting was mainly concerned with history subjects as against portraits, initially small and unpretentious, and iconic portrait-type religious and mythological subjects.  For most artists some commitment to realism was necessary in a portrait; few could take the high-handed approach of Michelangelo, who largely ignored the actual appearance of the [[Medici]] in his [[Medici Chapel]] sculptures, supposedly saying that in a thousand years no one would know the difference (a retort [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] is also said to have used, with a shorter timeframe).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many portraits were extremely flattering, which could be justified by an appeal to idealism as well as the sitter's vanity; the theorist [[Giovanni Battista Armenini|Armenini]]&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Battista Armenini (1533-1609) ''De vera precetti della pittura'' (1587), " On the True Precepts of the Art of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; claimed in 1587 that "portraits by excellent artists are considered to be painted with better style [''maniera''] and greater perfection than others, but more often than not they are less good likenesses".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 23-24 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, numbers of courtly sitters and their parents, suitors or courtiers complained that painters entirely failed to do justice to the reality of the sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 38-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of decorum in religious art became the focus of intense effort by the Catholic Church after the [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|decrees on art of the Council of Trent]] of 1563.  Paintings depicting biblical events as if they were occurring in the households of wealthy contemporary Italians were attacked, and soon ceased.  Until the challenge of [[Caravaggio]] at the end of the century, religious art became thoroughly ideal.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

==17th and 18th century art==
The new genres of landscape, genre painting, animal painting and still life came into their own in the 17th century, with the virtual cessation of religious painting in Protestant countries, and the expansion of picture buying to the prosperous middle class.  Although similar developments occurred in all advanced European countries, they were most evident in the enormously productive schools of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]].  However no theorists emerged to champion the new genres, and the relatively small amount of Dutch theoretical writing, by [[Karel van Mander]], [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]],&lt;ref&gt;''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'' ( Rotterdam 1678), "Introduction to the Academy of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerard de Lairesse]] and others, was mostly content to rehash Italian views, so that their writings can seem oddly at variance with the Dutch art actually being produced in their day.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

The hierarchy was mostly accepted by artists, and even genre specialists such as [[Jan Steen]], [[Karel Dujardin]] and [[Vermeer]] produced a few history paintings, which were better paid when commissions could be obtained, but in general far harder to sell.  The unhappy history of [[Rembrandt]]'s last history commission, ''[[The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis]]'' (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 69-77&lt;/ref&gt;  In Flanders, as well as great quantities of pure genre works, there was a trend towards history paintings with a major genre element, whether animals, landscape or still life.  Often the different elements were painted by different artists; [[Rubens]] and [[Frans Snyders]] often co-operated in this way.

The size of paintings, and very often the prices they realized, increasingly tended to reflect their position in the hierarchy in this period. Until the Romantic period the price and saleability of what were essentially landscapes could be increased by adding small mythological or religious figures, creating a ''landscape with...'', a practice that went back to the beginnings of landscape painting in the Flemish [[world landscape]]s of [[Joachim Patinir]] in the early 16th century. [[Flemish Baroque painting]] was the last school to often paint the lowest genres at a large size, but usually combined with figure subjects.

An influential formulation of 1667 by [[André Félibien]], a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:&lt;blockquote&gt;Celui qui fait parfaitement des païsages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne représentent que des choses mortes &amp; sans mouvement ; &amp; comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, &amp; ne peut prétendre à l'honneur que reçoivent les plus sçavans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure à la représentation de plusieurs ensemble ; il faut traiter l'histoire &amp; la fable ; il faut représenter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agréables comme les Poëtes ; &amp; montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions allégoriques, sçavoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, &amp; les mystères les plus relevez.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jl8IAeoj-7IC&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Books.google.co.uk], translation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more estimable than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled.  For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allegorical painting was raised above other types of [[history painting]]; together they were the ''grand genre'', including paintings with religious, mythological, historical, literary, or allegorical subjects—they embodied some interpretation of life or conveyed a moral or intellectual message. The gods and goddesses from the ancient mythologies represented different aspects of the human psyche, figures from religions represented different ideas, and history, like the other sources, represented a dialectic or play of ideas. Subjects with several figures ranked higher than single figures. For a long time, especially during the [[French Revolution]], history painting often focused on depiction of the heroic male nude; though this waned in the 19th century.

After history painting came, in order of decreasing worth: [[Portrait painting|portraits]], scenes of everyday life (called ''scènes de genre'', or "[[Genre works|genre painting]]", and also ''petit genre'' to contrast it with the ''grande genre''), [[Landscape art|landscapes]], animal painting, and finally [[still life]]s. In his formulation, such paintings were inferior because they were merely reportorial pictures without moral force or artistic imagination. Genre paintings—neither ideal in style, nor elevated in subject—were admired for their skill, ingenuity, and even humour, but never confused with high art. 

The hierarchy of genres also had a corresponding hierarchy of formats: large format for history paintings, small format for still lifes.  This had occasionally been breached in the past, especially in large Flemish works, and the monumental ''[[The Young Bull]]'' of the Dutch artist [[Paulus Potter]], as well as the larger of the two ''[[Butchers' Shop]]'' canvases of [[Annibale Carracci]].  But for the most part the relative prices obtainable for the different genres ensured the hierarchy of size also; it would not have been economic to paint a very large subject from the lower genres, except for commissioned group portraits.  Rubens' largest landscapes were painted for his own houses.

The use of the pictorial elements of painting such as line and color to convey an ultimate unifying theme or idea was regarded as the highest expression of art, and an idealism was adopted in art, whereby forms seen in nature would be generalized, and in turn subordinated to the unity of the artwork. It aimed at universal truth through the imitation of nature. Later  dissenting theorists, such as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], held that this focus on [[allegory]] was faulty and based on a wrong analogy between the plastic arts and poetry rooted in the [[Horace|Horatian]] dictum [[ut pictura poesis]] ("as is painting so is poetry").

The British painter [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] in his ''Discourses'' of the 1770s and 1780s, reiterated the argument for still life to the lowest position in the hierarchy of genres on the grounds that it interfered with the painter's access to central forms, those products of the mind's generalising powers. At the summit reigned history painting, centred on the human body: familiarity with the forms of the body permitted the mind of the painter, by comparing innumerable instances of the human form, to abstract from it those typical or central features that represented the body's essence or ideal.

Though Reynolds agreed with Félibien about the natural order of the genres, he held that an important work from any genre of painting could be produced under the hand of genius: "Whether it is the human figure, an animal, or even inanimate objects, there is nothing, however unpromising in appearance, but may be raised into dignity, convey sentiment, and produce emotion, in the hands of a painter of genius. What was said of [[Virgil]], that he threw even the dung about the ground with an air of dignity, may be applied to [[Titian]]; whatever he touched, however naturally mean, and habitually familiar, by a kind of magic he invested with grandeur and importance."

Though European academies usually strictly insisted on this hierarchy, over their reign, many artists were able to invent new genres which raised the lower subjects to the importance of history painting. Reynolds himself achieved this by inventing the portraiture style that was called the [[Grand Manner]], where he flattered his sitters by likening them to mythological characters. [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]] invented a genre that was called [[fêtes galantes]], where he would show scenes of courtly amusements taking place in Arcadian setting; these often had a poetic and allegorical quality which were considered to ennoble them. 

[[Claude Lorrain]] practised a genre called the [[ideal landscape]], where a composition would be loosely based on nature and dotted with classical ruins as a  setting for a biblical or historical theme. It artfully combined landscape and history painting, thereby legitimising the former. It is synonymous with the term ''historical landscape'' which received official recognition in the Académie française when a [[Prix de Rome]] for the genre was established in 1817. Finally, [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] was able to create still life paintings that were considered to have the charm and beauty as to be placed alongside the best allegorical subjects. However, aware of this hierarchy, Chardin began including figures in his work in about 1730, mainly women and children.

==19th century==
[[Romanticism]] greatly increased the status of landscape painting, beginning in [[British art]] and more gradually that of genre painting, which began to influence history painting in the anecdotal treatments of the [[Style Troubadour]] in France and equivalent trends elsewhere. Landscapes grew in size to reflect their new importance, often matching history paintings, especially in the American [[Hudson River School]] and Russian painting. Animal paintings also increased in size and dignity, but the full-length portrait, even of royalty, became mostly reserved for large public buildings.

Until the middle of the 19th century, [[women artists|women]] were largely unable to paint history paintings as they were not allowed to participate in the final process of artistic training—that of life drawing, in order to protect their modesty. They could work from reliefs, prints, casts and from the Old Masters, but not from the nude model. Instead they were encouraged to participate in the lower painting forms such as portraiture, landscape and genre. These were considered more feminine in that they appealed to the eye rather than the mind.

Toward the end of the 19th century, painters and critics began to rebel against the many rules of the Académie française, including the status accorded to [[history painting]], which was beginning to be bought mainly by public bodies of one sort or another, as private buyers preferred subjects from lower down the hierarchy.  In Britain the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement tried to revitalize the history painting, with mixed success; other movements made similar efforts.  Many Pre-Raphaelites ended their careers mainly painting other subjects.  New artistic movements included the [[Realism (visual arts)|Realists]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], which each sought to depict the present moment and daily life as observed by the eye, and unattatched from historical significance; the Realists often choosing genre painting and still life, while the Impressionists would most often focus on landscapes.

In [[natural language processing]], [[linguistics]], and neighboring fields, '''Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD)''' describes a method and an interdisciplinary community concerned with creating, sharing and (re-)using language resources in accordance with [[Linked Data]] principles. The '''Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud''' was conceived and is maintained by the [http://linguistics.okfn.org/  Open Linguistics Working Group (OWLG)] of the [[Open Knowledge|Open Knowledge Foundation]], but has been a point of focal activity for several [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] community groups, research projects and infrastructure efforts since then.

== Linguistic Linked Open Data ==
[[File:LLOD-Cloud-2016-05-24.png|thumb|LLOD Cloud (2016-05-24)]]
Linguistic Linked Open Data is a movement about publishing data for linguistics and natural language processing using the following principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Open Linguistics Working Group|title=Linguistic LOD|url=http://linguistic-lod.org/|website=linguistic-lod.org|publisher=LIDER project|accessdate=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Data should be openly licensed using licenses such as the [[Creative Commons]] licenses.
* The elements in a dataset should be uniquely identified by means of a [[URI]].
* The URI should resolve, so users can access more information using web browsers.
* Resolving an LLOD resource should return results using [[web standards]] such as [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF).
* [[Hyperlink|Links]] to other resources should be included to help users discover new resources and provide semantics.

The primary benefits of LLOD have been identified as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chiarcos|first1=Christian|last2=McCrae|first2=John|last3=Cimiano|first3=Philipp|last4=Fellbaum|first4=Christiane|title=Towards open data for linguistics: Lexical Linked Data|date=2013|publisher=In: Alessandro Oltramari, Piek Vossen, Lu Qin, and Eduard Hovy (eds.), New Trends of Research in Ontologies and Lexical Resources. Springer|location=Heidelberg|url=https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783642317811-c1.pdf|accessdate=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Representation: [[Linked graph]]s are a more flexible representation format for linguistic data.
* Interoperability: Common RDF models can easily be integrated.
* Federation: Data from multiple sources can trivially be combined.
* Ecosystem: Tools for RDF and linked data are widely available under open source licenses.
* Expressivity: Existing vocabularies help express linguistic resources.
* Semantics: Common links express what you mean.
* Dynamicity: Web data can be continuously improved.

=== Uses of LLOD ===
Linguistic Linked Open Data was applied to address a number of scientific research problems: 
* In all areas of empirical linguistics, [[computational philology]] and [[natural language processing]], linguistic annotation and linguistic markup represent central elements of analysis. However, progress in this field is being hampered by [[Interoperability|interoperability challenges]], most notably differences in vocabularies and annotation schemes used for different resources and tools. Using Linked Data to connect language resources and ontologies/terminology repositories facilitates re-using shared vocabularies and interpreting them against a common basis.
* In [[corpus linguistics]] and computational philology, [[overlapping markup]] represents a notorious problem to conventional [[XML]] formats. Hence, graph-based data models have been suggested since the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bird|first1=Steven|last2=Liberman|first2=Mark|title=Towards a formal framework for linguistic annotations|url=http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/sb/home/papers/icslp98.pdf|publisher=In:  Proceedings of the International Conference on Spoken Language Processing, Sydney, 1998|accessdate=2016-05-25}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are traditionally represented by means of multiple, interlinked XML files (standoff XML),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ISO 24612:2012|title=Language resource management -- Linguistic annotation framework (LAF)|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=37326|publisher=ISO|accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are poorly supported by off-the-shelf XML technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eckart|first1=Richard|title=Choosing an XML database for linguistically annotated corpora|date=2008|publisher=SDV.

* Providing forums for standardization of linguistic resource information

=== Selected LLOD resources ===

In October 2018, the 10 most frequently linked resources in the LLOD diagram are (in order of the number of linked datasets):

* The [http://purl.org/olia/ Ontologies of Linguistic Annotation] (OLiA, linked with 74 datasets) provide reference terminology for linguistic annotations and grammatical metadata;
* [[WordNet]] (linked with 51 datasets), a lexical database for English and pivot for developing similar databases for other languages, with several editions (Princeton edition linked with 36 datasets; W3C edition linked with 8 datasets; VU edition linked with 7 datasets);
* [[DBpedia]] (linked with 50 datasets) multilingual knowledge basis of general world knowledge, based on Wikipedia;
* [https://www.lexinfo.net/ lexinfo.net] (linked with 36 datasets) provides reference terminology for lexical resources;
* [[BabelNet]] (linked with 33 datasets)  multilingual lexicalized semantic network, based on the aggregation of various other resources, most notably WordNet and Wikipedia;
* [http://www.lexvo.org/ lexvo.org] (linked with 26 datasets) provides language identifiers and other language-related data. Most importantly, lexvo provides a RDF representation of [[ISO_639-3]] 3-letter codes for language identifiers and information about these languages;
* The [[ISO_12620]] Data Category Registry (ISOcat; RDF edition, linked with 10 datasets) provides a semistructured repository for various language-related terminology. ISOcat is hosted by The Language Archive, respectively, the [[DOBES]] project, at the [[Max_Planck_Institute_for_Psycholinguistics]], but currently in transition to [[CLARIN]];
* [[UBY]] (RDF edition &lt;i&gt;lemon-Uby&lt;/i&gt;, linked with 9 datasets), a lexical network for English, aggregated from various lexical resources;
* [[Glottolog]] (linked with 7 datasets) provides fine-grained language identifiers for low-resource languages, in particular many not covered by lexvo.org;
* [[Wiktionary]]-[[DBpedia]] links (&lt;i&gt;wiktionary.dbpedia.org&lt;/i&gt;, linked with 7 datasets), Wiktionary-based lexicalizations for DBpedia concepts.

=== LLOD cloud development and community activities ===
The LLOD cloud diagram is maintained by the Open Linguistics Working Group (OWLG) of the Open Knowledge Foundation (since 2014 Open Knowledge), an open and interdisciplinary of experts in language resources.

The OWLG organizes community events and coordinates LLOD developments and facilitates interdisciplinary communication between and among LLOD contributors and users.

Several W3C Business and Community Groups focus on specialized aspects of LLOD:
* The W3C Ontology-Lexica Community Group develops and maintains specifications for machine-readable dictionaries in the LLOD cloud
* The W3C Best Practices for Multilingual Linked Open Data Community Group gathers information on best practises for producing multilingual linked open data.
* The W3C Linked Data for Language Technology Community Group assembles user cases and requirements for language technology applications that use Linked Data.

LLOD development is driven forward by and documented in series of international workshops, datathons, and associated publications. Among others, these include
* Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL), annual scientific workshop, since 2012
* Multilingual Linked Open Data for Enterprises (MLODE), bi-annual community meeting (2012 and 2014)
* Summer Datathon on Linguistic Linked Open Data (SD-LLOD), bi-annual datathon, since 2015

Uses and development of LLOD have been subject to several research projects, including
* [https://archive.is/20140307183201/http://lod2.okfn.org/ LOD2] (11 EU countries + Korea, 2010–2014)
* MONNET (5 EU countries, 2010–2013)
* [http://www.lider-project.eu LIDER] (5 EU countries, 2013–2015)

The [[reality show|reality series]] ''[[On the Lot]]'' revolves around competing directors creating short films each week. The directors and their films are voted on by the viewing audience. The top vote-getters are highlighted and given an encore showing on the program. The bottom vote-getters are eliminated from the competition.

==Semi-finals - "Out of time"==
In the second episode, the 36 remaining semi-finalists were asked to divide themselves into groups of three and write, shoot, and edit a short film within 24 hours based on the theme "out of time" and each director was judged individually on his or her section of the film.

The '''National Endowment for the Humanities''' ('''NEH''') is an independent federal agency of the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;government]], established by the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 ({{USPL|89|209}}), dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the [[humanities]]. The NEH is housed at 400 7th St SW, [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/about/visiting-neh | title=Visiting NEH | publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1979 to 2014, NEH was at 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., [[Washington, D.C.]] in the [[Old Post Office Pavilion|Nancy Hanks Center at the Old Post Office]].

==History and overview==
The NEH provides grants for high-quality humanities projects to cultural institutions such as museums, archives, libraries, colleges, universities, public television, and radio stations, and to individual scholars.

NEH was created in 1965 under the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities, which included the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and later the [[Institute for Museum and Library Services|Institute for Museum Services]], as a move to provide greater investment in culture by the federal government.&lt;ref name="NEH-history"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/about/history | title=How NEH Got Its Start | publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEH was based upon recommendation of the National Commission on the Humanities, convened in 1963 with representatives from three US scholarly and educational associations.&lt;ref name="NEH-history"/&gt;

The agency creates incentives for excellent work in the humanities by awarding grants that strengthen teaching and learning in the humanities in schools and colleges across the nation, facilitate research and original scholarship, provide opportunities for lifelong learning, preserve and provide access to cultural and educational resources and to strengthen the institutional base of the humanities. As part of its mandate to support humanities programs in every US state and territory, the agency supports a network of private, nonprofit affiliates, the [[list of state humanities councils|56 humanities councils in the states and territories of the United States]].

The ninth NEH Chair was [[Jim Leach]]. President Obama nominated the former Iowa congressman, a Republican, to chair the NEH on June 3, 2009;&lt;ref&gt;Robin Pogrebin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/arts/04neh.html "Obama Names a Republican to Lead the Humanities Endowment"], ''[[New York Times]]'', June 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the Senate confirmed his appointment in August 2009.&lt;ref name="Landesman"&gt;Robin Pogrebin, [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/rocco-landesman-confirmed-as-chairman-of-the-national-endowment-for-the-arts/ "Rocco Landesman Confirmed as Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts"], ''New York Times'', August 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Leach began his term as the NEH Chair on August 12, 2009 and stepped down in May 2013. Between November 2009 and May 2011, Leach conducted the American "Civility Tour" to call attention to the need to restore reason and civility back into politics, a goal that in his words was "central to the humanities." Leach visited each of the 50 states, speaking at venues ranging from university and museum lecture halls to hospitals for veterans, to support the return of non-emotive, civil exchange and rational consideration of other viewpoints. According to Leach, "Little is more important...than establishing an ethos of thoughtfulness and decency of expression in the public square. Words reflect emotion as well as meaning. They clarify—or cloud—thought and energize action, sometimes bringing out the better angels in our nature, sometimes lesser instincts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/29/AR2009112902014.html | title=E.J. Dionne Welcomes Jim Leach's Call for Civility | publisher=The Washington Post | date=30 November 2009 | accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the completion of Leach's Civility Tour, rallies for reasoning politics like [[Jon Stewart]]'s [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear|Rally to Restore Sanity]] and grassroots initiatives for [[Pluralistic Rationalism|pluralistic rationalism]] in public discourse, have reflected Leach's call for civil, non-emotive and reasoning language between those with disparate religious or political ideologies.&lt;ref name="ICC3"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160202190225/http://www.twincities.com/2014/08/03/st-pauls-atheists-are-coming-out-of-the-closet/ "St. Paul's atheists are coming out of the closet," Bob Shaw, ''St. Paul Pioneer Press'', August 4, 2014]. Retrieved August 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenth Chair of the NEH was [[William Drea Adams|William 'Bro' Adams]], who served from 2014 to 2017. President Obama nominated Adams on April 4, 2014;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2014-04-10 | title=President Obama Announces his Intent to Nominate Dr. William "Bro" Adams as Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/254802741.html | title=Obama nominates William 'Bro' Adams to be next head of National Endowment for the Humanities | work=Minneapolis Star Tribune | date=10 April 2014 | accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.colby.edu/news/2014/04/10/adams-tapped-by-president-obama/ | title=Adams Tapped by President Obama | publisher=Colby College | accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote on July 9, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress/senate-confirms-head-of-us-humanities-endowment/2014/07/09/133baaf6-0796-11e4-9ae6-0519a2bd5dfa_story.html | title=Senate confirms head of US Humanities Endowment | publisher=The Washington Post | accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams appointed Margaret (Peggy) Plympton as the Deputy NEH Chair in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/about/chairman/deputy-chairman | title=Deputy Chair | publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate=25 February 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314183912/http://www.neh.gov/about/chairman/deputy-chairman | archivedate=14 March 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before Adams's appointment, the NEH was headed by Acting Chair [[Carole M. Watson]]. Adams resigned his appointment on May 23, 2017, when he cited accomplishments under the "Common Good" initiative and the appointment of new administration officials.&lt;ref name="Adams-resignation"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2017-05-22 |title=NEH Chairman William D. Adams Announces Resignation |date=May 22, 2017  |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Endowment is directed by the [[Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities|NEH Chair]]. Advising the Chair is the National Council on the Humanities, a board of 26&amp;nbsp;distinguished private citizens who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.&lt;ref name="nch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/about/national-council-on-the-humanities | title=National Council on the Humanities | publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Council members serve staggered six-year terms.

===The NEH Chair===
The Endowment is directed by a [[Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities|Chair]], who has legal authority to approve all recommendations and award grants and cooperative agreements. The Chair is nominated by the President and confirmed with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate. The Chair's decisions are informed by recommendations from the National Council on the Humanities, peer-reviewers who are selected to read each project proposal submitted to the Endowment, as well as by the Endowment's staff.

===Major program offices===
The NEH has seven grant-making divisions and offices:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/divisions | title=Information about the Divisions and Offices that Administer NEH Grant Programs | publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The Division of Preservation and Access''' awards grants to preserve, maintain, and improve access to primary sources in the humanities, in both digital and analog form.
* '''The Division of Public Programs''' supports projects that bring the humanities to large audiences through libraries and museums, television and radio, historic sites, and digital media.
* '''The Division of Research''' makes awards to support the publication of books in and outside the humanities.
* '''The Division of Education''' works to support and strengthen teaching of the humanities.
* '''The Office of Federal/State Partnership''' collaborates with 56 state and territory humanities councils to strengthen local programs.
* '''The Office of Challenge Grants''' administers grants intended to support centers and endowments through fundraising by humanities institutions to further long-term stability. This Office was abolished by the Trump Administration in 2017.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}
* '''The Office of Digital Humanities''' advises on use of technology in the humanities and coordinates.

===Special initiatives===
These are special priorities of the endowment that indicate critical areas of the humanities as identified by the NEH Chair. They differ from the divisions of the endowment in that they do not sponsor or coordinate specific grant programs.

====Bridging Cultures initiative====
Bridging Cultures is an NEH initiative that explores ways the humanities promote understanding and mutual respect for people with diverse histories, cultures, and perspectives. Projects supported through this initiative focus on cultures globally as well as within the United States.&lt;ref name="bridging.cultures"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/divisions/bridging-cultures | title=About the Bridging Cultures Initiative | accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; International projects might seek to enlarge Americans' understanding of other places and times, as well as other perspectives and intellectual traditions. American projects might explore the great variety of cultural influences on, and myriad subcultures within, American society. 

These projects might investigate how Americans have approached and attempted to surmount seemingly unbridgeable cultural divides or examine the ideals of civility and civic discourse. In connection with a focus on civic discourse, projects might explore the role of women in America's civic life as well as the civic role of women in other cultures and regions of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

====Standing Together====
This initiative, launched in 2014, marks a priority to make awards that promote understanding of the military experience and to support returning veterans.&lt;ref name="neh.standing.together"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/veterans/standing-together | title=NEH Veterans Initiative | accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====We the People====
''We the People'' was an NEH special funding stream initiated by NEH Chair Coles, using dedicated funds available to each Chair of the NEH, which was designed to encourage and enhance the teaching, study, and understanding of American history, culture, and democratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wethepeople.gov/ | title=We the People | accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative supports projects and programs that explore significant events and themes in American nation's history, which advance knowledge of the principles that define America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ucsb.edu/thoreau/misc_awards.html |archivedate=2010-03-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302174451/http://www.library.ucsb.edu/thoreau/misc_awards.html |date=March 2, 2010 |title=The Writings of Henry D. Thoreau }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to NEH, the initiative led a renaissance in knowledge about American history and principles among all US citizens. The initiative was launched on Constitution Day, September 17, 2002 and active through 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wethepeople.gov/about/index.html |title=About We the People |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403185208/http://wethepeople.gov/about/index.html |archivedate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

===Jefferson Lecture===
{{Main article|Jefferson Lecture}}
Since 1972 the NEH has sponsored the [[Jefferson Lecture]] in the Humanities, which it describes as "the highest honor the federal government confers for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities." The Jefferson Lecturer is selected each year by the National Council on the Humanities. The honoree delivers a lecture in Washington, D.C., during the spring, and receives an honorarium of $10,000. The stated purpose of the honor is to recognize "an individual who has made significant scholarly contributions in the humanities and who has the ability to communicate the knowledge and wisdom of the humanities in a broadly appealing way."&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lecturers] at NEH Website (retrieved January 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Humanities Medal and Charles Frankel Prize===
{{Main article|National Humanities Medal}}
The National Humanities Medal, inaugurated in 1997, honors individuals or groups whose work has deepened the nation's understanding of the humanities, broadened citizens' engagement with the humanities, or helped preserve and expand Americans' access to important resources in the humanities. Up to 12&amp;nbsp;medals can be awarded each year. From 1989 to 1996 the NEH awarded a similar prize known as the [[Charles Frankel]] Prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/awards.html Awards and Honors] at NEH Website (retrieved January 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The new award, a bronze medallion, was designed by David Macaulay, the 1995 winner of the Frankel Prize.

==''Humanities'' magazine==
Starting in 1969, the NEH published a periodical called ''Humanities''; that original incarnation was discontinued in 1978. In 1980, ''Humanities'' magazine was relaunched ({{ISSN|0018-7526}}). It is published six times per year, with one cover article each year dedicated to profiling that year's Jefferson Lecturer. Most of its articles have some connection to NEH activities. The magazine's editor since 2007 has been journalist and author [[David Skinner (journalist)|David Skinner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2007/septemberoctober/ednote/editor%25E2%2580%2599s-note-septemberoctober-2007|title=Editor’s Note, September/October 2007|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 until her death in 2007, ''Humanities'' was edited by Mary Lou Beatty (who had previously been a high-ranking editor at the [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post'']]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2007/marchapril/ednote/editors-note-marchapril-2007|title=Editor&amp;#039;s Note, March/April 2007|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/08/AR2007020802132.html|title=Mary Lou Beatty; Editor at NEH, Post|last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|date=2007-02-09|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On a Clear Day You Can See Forever''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with music by [[Burton Lane]] and a [[Libretto|book]] and lyrics by [[Alan Jay Lerner]] based loosely on ''[[Berkeley Square (play)|Berkeley Square]]'', written in 1929 by [[John L. Balderston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941500,00.html?promoid=googlep |title=Theater: Please Don't Pick on Daisy |publisher=TIME |date=1965-10-29 |accessdate=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It concerns a woman who has [[extra-sensory perception|ESP]] and has been [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]]. The musical received three [[Tony Awards|Tony Award]] nominations.

==Productions==
The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened at the [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]] on October 17, 1965 and closed on June 11, 1966 after 280 performances and 3 previews.

[[Louis Jourdan]] was the original leading man when the show had its tryout at the Colonial Theatre in Boston but was replaced by Cullum before it reached Broadway. [[Scenic design]] was by [[Oliver Smith (designer)|Oliver Smith]] and [[costume design]] was by [[Freddy Wittop]].  The show was not well received. [[Ben Brantley]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' recalled: "Its book was strained and muddled, most critics agreed; its big production numbers were simply cumbersome.  But it did have [a] lushly melodic score...."&lt;ref name=NYT2000&gt;[http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?_r=1&amp;html_title=&amp;tols_title=ON%20A%20CLEAR%20DAY%20YOU%20CAN%20SEE%20FOREVER%20(PLAY)&amp;byline=By%20BEN%20BRANTLEY&amp;pdate=20000212&amp;id=1077011431006&amp;oref=slogin Brantley, Ben.

==Synopsis==
;Act I
Quirky Daisy Gamble sees herself as an unremarkable person and has low self-esteem, even though she can (1) make plants grow remarkably, (2) predict when a telephone will ring or someone will drop in, and (3) tell where to find an object that someone else is looking for.  Her current problem, though, is her nasty smoking habit, which will interfere with the chances of her fiancé, Warren, for a job with great benefits.  She seeks help from a psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Bruckner, to stop smoking.  When he hypnotizes her, she describes living a previous life in late 18th century England as "Melinda Wells", who died in her late twenties from circumstances beyond her control.  Free spirited Melinda was in love with portrait painter Edward Moncrief.  Dr. Mark keeps to himself what Daisy has revealed to him, and he tells her that she should not be ashamed of her ESP.

At their next session, Daisy, under hypnosis, relates scenes from the salacious London Hellrakers' Club where Melinda met Edward.  Melinda and Edward eventually marry, but the painter is unfaithful to her, making love to his subjects.  Mark, the psychiatrist, finds himself falling for "Melinda" and becomes convinced that Daisy is really the reincarnation of Melinda.  Melinda finally left Edward and set sail for America, but the ship never reached Boston.  Before Mark can save Melinda from shipwreck, Daisy wakes up.

;Act II
Mark reports on the case to his fellow psychiatrists, who ridicule his findings.  Greek shipping magnate Themistocles Kriakos learns of Mark's belief in reincarnation and offers to finance a study of the events of Melinda's life in exchange for Mark's help in discovering who he will be in his next life, which will allow him to leave his fortune to his future self.  Daisy accidentally discovers that she is the "Melinda" at the center of the growing controversy and that Mark prefers Melinda to herself.  In her angry confrontation with the psychiatrist about the matter, she tells him that she is "through being a go-between for you and your dream girl.  You're not going to go on using my head for a motel."  

Daisy goes to the airport, ready to return home.  Her ESP powers warn her that the plane on which she plans to travel will crash.  She realizes at last how special she really is.  She leaves her starchy fiancé (Come Back To Me) and she and Mark unite to explore their extraordinary future.

==Versions==
The musical is available in at least two noticeably different published versions (aside from the film version), although the basic plot-line remains the same.  The first version was published in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;''On a Clear Day You Can See Forever'': a musical play, by Alan Jay Lerner. Music by Burton Lane.  New York: Random House, c. 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;  The musical numbers recorded in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] cast album&lt;ref&gt;''On a Clear Day You Can See Forever'': the original Broadway cast recording. RCA Victor. LSOD-2006 Stereo, LP.  c1965. (also on CD)&lt;/ref&gt; of 1965 correspond to this version.  

A second version is evident in the piano-vocal score published in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;''On a Clear Day You Can See Forever''.  Vocal score.  Piano reduction by Robert H. Noeltner.  New York:  Chappell &amp; Co., Inc., 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;  Here several vocal [[Number (music)|numbers]] from the above version are missing ("Ring Out the Bells," "Tosy and Cosh", "Don't Tamper with my Sister"), as is the introduction to the song "Hurry, It's Lovely Up Here," which is recorded on the cast album.  Also, the Greek millionaire's solo, "When I'm Being Born Again" is given completely different lyrics ("When I Come Around Again") and sung instead by Daisy's friends.  The [[overture]] recorded on the cast album combines the "overture" and "[[entr'acte]]" printed in the vocal score.

The [[On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (film)|1970 film version]] departed from the musical significantly, adding a character for [[Jack Nicholson]] (an ex-stepbrother named "Tad"), and changing details of other characters, moving the period of Melinda's life ahead by a decade or two (into the early 19th century), removing several songs, changing lyrics and adding two new songs.

† Songs taken from the musical film [[Royal Wedding]].

Note: In the piano-vocal score, a song appears that was not included in the original Broadway production: "The Solicitor's Song", during Daisy's first regression-scene. There was also a ballet in the first act of the original production, entitled "At the Hellrakers" and the song "Ring Out the Bells" that are not found on the original Broadway recording.

==Recordings==
The title song has been recorded by a number of artists, including [[Robert Goulet]], Johnny Mathis, baseball pitcher [[Denny McLain]], and by [[Sergio Franchi]] on his 1976 DynaHouse and TeleHouse albums;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/sergio-franchi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140713085432/http://www.discogs.com/sergio-franchi |archivedate=2014-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbra Streisand]], star of the 1970 film version, recorded the title song on the film's soundtrack. [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] has also performed the title song live in concert, and [[Harry James]] released a version in 1967 on his album ''Our Leader!'' ([[Dot Records|Dot]] DLP 3801 and DLP 25801). In 2012, [[The Peddlers]]' 1968 jazz cover was used in season 5 episode 3 ("Hazard Pay") of [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC-TV]]'s ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' over a montage of Walt and Jesse's [[Clandestine chemistry#Amphetamines|meth manufacturing]]. 

"What Did I Have That I Don't Have" was covered with some success by [[Eydie Gorme]] and was also sung by Streisand on the soundtrack on the film version. "Come Back to Me" was recorded by swing revival band the [[Cherry Poppin' Daddies]] in 1994, which later appeared on their multi-platinum 1997 compilation ''[[Zoot Suit Riot (album)|Zoot Suit Riot]]'' and was re-recorded for their 2014 [[Rat Pack]] tribute ''[[Please Return the Evening]]''.

The title song is reminiscent of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s "Dawn" movement from his ballet ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Andrew.  [http://www.harvardindependent.com/2016/02/violins-and-valentines/ "Violins and Valentines"], ''[[The Harvard Independent]]'' (February 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oto-Manguean languages''' (also '''Otomanguean''') are a large family comprising several subfamilies of [[indigenous languages of the Americas]]. All of the Oto-Manguean languages that are now spoken are indigenous to [[Mexico]], but the Manguean branch of the family, which is now [[extinct language|extinct]], was spoken as far south as [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]]. Oto-Manguean is widely viewed as a proven language family. However, this status has been recently challenged (Brown 2015).

The highest number of speakers of Oto-Manguean languages today are found in the state of [[Oaxaca]] where the two largest branches, the [[Zapotecan languages|Zapotecan]] and [[Mixtecan languages|Mixtecan]] languages, are spoken by almost 1.5 million people combined. In central Mexico, particularly in the states of [[Mexico (state)|Mexico]], [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]] and [[Querétaro]], the languages of the Oto-Pamean branch are spoken: the [[Otomi language|Otomi]] and the closely related [[Mazahua language|Mazahua]] have over 500,000 speakers combined. Some Oto-Manguean languages are moribund or highly endangered; for example, [[Ixcatec]] and [[Matlatzinca language|Matlatzinca]] each has fewer than 250 speakers, most of whom are elderly. Other languages particularly of the Manguean branch which was spoken outside of Mexico have become [[extinct language|extinct]]; these include the [[Chiapanec language]], which has only recently been declared extinct. Others such as [[Subtiaba language|Subtiaba]], which was most closely related to [[Tlapanec language|Me'phaa]] (Tlapanec), have been extinct longer and are only known from early 20th century descriptions.

The Oto-Manguean language family is the most diverse and most geographically widespread language family represented in Mesoamerica. The internal diversity is comparable with that of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], and the Proto-Oto-Manguean language is estimated to have been spoken some time before 2000 BCE.&lt;ref name="Kaufman &amp; Justeson 2009:227"&gt;Kaufman &amp; Justeson 2009:227&lt;/ref&gt; This means that at least for the past 4000 years Oto-Manguean languages have coexisted with the other languages of [[Mesoamerica]] and have developed many traits in common with these, to such an extent that they are seen as part of a [[sprachbund]] called the [[Mesoamerican Linguistic Area]]. However Oto-Manguean also stands out from the other language families of Mesoamerica in several features. It is the only language family in [[North America]], [[Languages of Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica]] and [[Central America]] whose members are all [[tonal languages]]. It also stands out by having a much more [[Analytic language|analytic]] structure than other Mesoamerican languages. Another typical trait of Oto-Manguean is that its members almost all show VSO ([[verb–subject–object]]) in basic order of clausal constituents.

==History of classification==

===Internal classification and reconstruction===
A genetic relationship between Zapotecan and Mixtecan was first proposed by [[Manuel Orozco y Berra]] in 1864, he also included Cuicatec, Chocho and Amuzgo in his grouping. In 1865 Pimentel added Mazatec, Popoloca, Chatino and Chinantec – he also posed a separate group of Pame, Otomi and Mazahua, the beginning of the Oto-Pamean subbranch. [[Daniel Brinton]]'s classification of 1891 added Matlatzinca and Chichimeca Jonaz to Pimentel's Oto-Pamean group (which wasn't known by that name then), and he reclassified some languages of the previously included languages of the Oaxacan group.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} In 1920 Walther Lehmann included the Chiapanec–Mangue languages and correctly established the major subgroupings of the Oaxacan group. And in 1926 Schmidt coined the name Otomi–Mangue for a group consisting of the Oto-Pamean languages and Chiapanec–Mangue. The Oto-Pamean group and the Main Oaxacan group were not joined together into one family until [[Edward Sapir|Sapir's]] classification in 1929, where it was included in the [[Hokan languages|Hokan family]].

From the 1950s on reconstructive work began to be done on individual Oto-Manguean language groups. Proto-Oto-Pamean was reconstructed by [[Doris Bartholomew]], Proto-Zapotecan by [[Morris Swadesh]], Proto-Chiapanec–Mangue by Fernández de Miranda and [[Roberto Weitlaner|Weitlaner]].The classification by Campbell 1997 was the first to present a unified view of the Oto-Manguean languages. In 1981 William Merrifield published a reconstruction of the [[Kinship terminology|kinship terminologies]] of each of the Oto-Manguean branches and of Proto-Oto-Manguean. Unpublished reconstructions of Proto-Oto-Manguean grammar have also been made by [[Terrence Kaufman]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman &amp; Justeson 2009. (&lt;br&gt;Kaufman, Terrence, 1983 New Perspectives on Comparative Otomanguean Phonology. Excerpts presented at the 82nd Annual Meeting of the American Anthropological Association, Chicago, 1983. Complete manuscript on file, Department of Anthropology, University of Pittsburgh. &lt;br&gt;1988 Otomangean Tense/Aspect/Mood, Voice, and Nominalization Markers. Manuscript on file, Department of Anthropology, University of Pittsburgh.)&lt;/ref&gt;
In spite of the lack of a full published reconstruction of proto-Oto-Manguean, the language family has now been widely accepted by specialists, including [[Lyle Campbell]], [[Terrence Kaufman]], and [[William Poser]]. Campbell and Poser writing in 2008 concluded that ""Tlapanec-Subtiaba proved not to belong to 'Hokan' as postulated by Sapir (1925a), but to be a branch of Otomanguean ..."" Nonetheless a few studies have retained the inclusion in Hokan, particularly [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s widely rejected 1987 classification,&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg 1987&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its derivative works by [[Merritt Ruhlen]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg &amp; Ruhlen 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1988, Leonardo Manrique still listed Tlapanec-Mangue as an isolated family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-01.sil.org/MEXICO/workpapers/WP013-PDF/MephaaBibliografia_Public.pdf Marlett, Stephen. 2013. "Bibliografia del Me'phaa", SIL]&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of the [[Amuzgo language]] as either a part of the Mixtecan group or as forming its own branch from the proto-Oto-Manguean node has been discussed by Longacre, who argued for the latter,&lt;ref&gt;Longacre 1966&lt;/ref&gt; but the currently most accepted classification by [[Lyle Campbell|Campbell]] (1997) follows [[Terrence Kaufman]] in considering Amuzgo to be a branch of Mixtecan. Swadesh (1960) and Rensch included the [[Huave language]] as a separate branch within Oto-Manguean, but this inclusion has proved untenable as most of the cognates were loan-words from Zapotec. Huave is now considered an [[Language isolate|isolate]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1997:161&lt;/ref&gt;

Longacre (1968) considered Oto-Manguean to be among the most extensively studied language families of the world, with a level reconstruction rivaling the [[Indo-European family]] in completeness, but Kaufman and Justeson (2009) reject this, lamenting the rudimentary reconstruction of Proto-Oto-Manguean lexicon (only c. 350 items have been reconstructed) and grammar. They call for a redoubling of the effort to document and reconstruct several important branches that have received little attention: principally Mixtecan, Popolocan and Oto-Pamean.

Brown (2015) evaluates evidence assembled in support of Oto-Manguean. He points out that vocabulary reconstructed for Proto-Oto-Manguean is not supported by regular sound correspondences. While scholars, including Swadesh, Rensch, and Kaufman, have all reconstructed POM words, none have done so with the benefit of detailed sound correspondences and, consequently Brown argues that their reconstructions as well as Oto-Manguean itself are called into question. Nevertheless, Brown (2015) suggests that Oto-Manguean as Sprachbund (language diffusion area) is a reasonable alternative hypothesis to the proposal of Oto-Manguean as a language family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Eric W.|title=Otomanguean historical linguistics: Past, present, and prospects for the future´|journal=Language and Linguistics Compass|volume= 11|issue=4|doi=10.1111/lnc3.12240

===Inclusion in macro-family hypotheses===
Some early classifications such as that by Brinton, considered that Oto-Manguean languages might be related to [[Chinese language|Chinese]], because like Chinese the languages were tonal and mostly monosyllabic. This idea was quickly abandoned as it was discovered that tonal languages are common, and advances in the historical study of Chinese were made (including the discovery that [[Old Chinese]] was non-tonal).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1997:157&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Sapir included Subtiaba–Tlapanec in his [[Hokan languages|Hokan]] phylum, but didn't classify the other Oto-Manguean languages in his famous 1929 classification. In his 1960 classification, [[Joseph Greenberg]] considered Oto-Manguean so aberrant from other Native American languages that it was the only accepted family (aside from the [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] isolate) which he made a primary branch of his [[Amerind languages|Amerind]] family. However, in his 1987 revision he linked it with [[Aztec-Tanoan]] in a "Central Amerind" branch, apart from Tlapanec which, although it had by then been unequivocally linked to Oto-Manguean, he continued to classify as Hokan.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1997:211&lt;/ref&gt; No hypotheses including Oto-Manguean in any higher-level unit have been able to withstand scrutiny.

==Prehistory==
The Oto-Manguean family has existed in southern Mexico at least since 2000 BCE and probably several thousand years before,&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman &amp; Justeson 2009&lt;/ref&gt; some estimates using the controversial method of [[glottochronology]] suggest an approximate splitting date of Proto-Otomanguean at c. 4400 BCE.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1997, p.159"&gt;Campbell (1997, p.159)&lt;/ref&gt;  This makes the Oto-Manguean family the language family of the Americas with the deepest time depth, as well as the oldest language family with evidence of tonal contrast in the proto-language.{{sfn|Sicoli|2005|p=797}}

The Oto-Manguean [[urheimat]] has been thought to be in the [[Tehuacán]] valley in connection with one of the earliest neolithic cultures of [[Mesoamerica]], and although it is now in doubt whether Tehuacán was the original home of the Proto-Otomanguean people, it is agreed that the Tehuacán culture (5000 BCE–2300 BCE) were likely Oto-Mangue speakers.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1997, p.159"/&gt;

The long history of the Oto-Manguean family has resulted in considerable linguistic diversity between the branches of the family. [[Terrence Kaufman]] compares the diversity between the main branches of Oto-Manguean with that between the main branches of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]].&lt;ref name="Kaufman &amp; Justeson 2009:227"/&gt; Kaufman also proposes that Oto-Manguean languages are an important candidate for being the source of many of the traits that have diffused into the other [[Mesoamerican languages|languages]] in the [[Mesoamerican linguistic area]].

Oto-Mangue speakers have been among the earliest to form highly complex cultures of [[Mesoamerica]]: the archeological site of [[Monte Albán]] with remains dated as early as 1000 BCE is believed to have been in continuous use by [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]]. The undeciphered [[Mesoamerican writing systems#Zapotec writing|Zapotec script]] is one of the earliest forms of Mesoamerican writing.

Other Mesoamerican cultural centers which may have been wholly or partly Oto-Manguean include the late classical sites of [[Xochicalco]], which may have been built by [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]]s, and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], which may have been inhabited by Manguean peoples. And some propose an Oto-Pamean presence in [[Teotihuacán]]. The Zapotecs are among the candidates to have invented the first [[Mesoamerican writing systems|writing system of Mesoamerica]] – and in the Post-Classic period the Mixtecs were prolific artesans and codex painters. During the postclassic the Oto-Manguean cultures of Central Mexico became marginalized by the intruding [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]]s and some, like the Chiapanec–Mangue speakers went south into Guerrero, Chiapas and Central America, while others such as the [[Otomi people|Otomi]] saw themselves relocated from their ancient homes in the Valley of Mexico to the less fertile highlands on the rim of the valleys.

==Geography and demographics==

===Western branch===

====Oto-Pamean====
{{Main|Oto-Pamean languages}}
[[File:Otomi speakers.png|250px|right|thumb|Map of the different dialect areas of Otomí in central Mexico]]
The languages of the [[Oto-Pamean languages|Oto-Pamean]] branch are spoken in central and western Mexico. The group includes the Otomian languages: [[Otomi language|Otomi]] spoken primarily in the states of [[Estado de México|Mexico]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Puebla]] and [[Veracruz]] (c. 293,000 speakers) and [[Mazahua language|Mazahua]] spoken in the western part of the State of Mexico (c. 350,000 speakers), and the endangered [[Matlatzincan languages]]  including [[Matlatzinca language|Matlatzinca]] (c. 1000 speakers in the town of San Francisco Oxtotilpa) and [[Tlahuica]] (also called Ocuilteco) (c. 400 speakers in the municipio of [[Ocuilan]]) both spoken in the State of Mexico; And the Pamean group composed of the two living [[Pame language]]s of [[San Luís Potosí]], Northern Pame [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=pmq] being spoken in communities from the north of [[Río Verde (San Luis Potosi)|Río Verde]] on the border with [[Tamaulipas]] (c. 5500 speakers), and Central Pame [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=pbs] spoken in the town of Santa María Acapulco (c. 4000 speakers), the extinct Southern Pame language, and the [[Chichimeca Jonaz language]] spoken in Misión de Chichimecas near [[San Luis de la Paz]] in the state of [[Guanajuato]] (c. 200 speakers).

Otomi is traditionally described as a single language, although its many dialects are not all mutually intelligible. The language classification of the SIL International's [[Ethnologue]] considers Otomi to be a cover term for nine separate Otomi languages and assigns a different [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] code to each of these nine varieties. Currently Otomi varieties are spoken collectively by c. 239,000 speakers — some 5 to 6 percent of whom are [[monolingual]]. Because of recent migratory patterns, small populations of Otomi speakers can be found in new locations throughout Mexico and in the United States. The Otomi languages are vigorous in some areas, with children acquiring the language through natural transmission (e.g. in the [[Mezquital Valley]] of Hidalgo and in the Highlands). However three varieties are now considered [[Moribund language|moribund]]: those of Ixtenco ([[Tlaxcala]] state), Santiago Tilapa and Acazulco ([[Mexico state]]), and Cruz del Palmar ([[Guanajuato]] state).&lt;ref name=lastra1925&gt;Lastra, ''Unidad y diversidad de la lengua'', pp. 19–25.&lt;/ref&gt; In some municipalities the level of monolingualism in Otomi is as high as 22.3% ([[Huehuetla Municipality, Hidalgo|Huehuetla]], Hidalgo) or 13.1% ([[Texcatepec]], Veracruz). Monolingualism is normally significantly higher among women than among men.&lt;ref&gt;INEGI, ''Perfil sociodemográfico'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chinantecan====
The [[Chinantecan languages]] are spoken by c. 93,000 people in Northern Oaxaca and Southern Veracruz in the districts of Cuicatlán, [[Ixtlán de Juárez]], Tuxtepec and Choapan. The [[Ethnologue]] recognizes 14 separate varieties with separate ISO codes.

====Tlapanec–Mangue====
The [[Tlapanec language]] is spoken by c. 75,000 people in [[Guerrero]]. There are four principal varieties named after the communities where they are spoken: Acatepec, Azoyú, Malinaltepec and Tlacoapa. Recent labor migrations have introduced Tlapanec speaking communities to the state of [[Morelos]]. It was closely related to the [[Subtiaba language]] which was spoken in Nicaragua but which is now extinct.

The [[Manguean languages]] are all extinct. They included the [[Mangue language|Mangue]] and [[Chorotega language|Chorotega]] languages that were spoken in [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]] at the beginning of the 20th century, and the [[Chiapanec language]] which was spoken in [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]] by a handful of speakers in the 1990s, but is now extinct.

===Eastern branch===

====Popolocan====
The Popolocan language group includes the  seven different varieties of [[Popoloca languages|Popoloca]] which are spoken in southern [[Puebla]] state  near [[Tehuacán, Puebla|Tehuacán]] and Tepexi de Rodríguez (c. 30,000 speakers), and the closely related [[Chocho language]] (c. 700 speakers) spoken in Northern Oaxaca state, and the 8 different [[Mazatecan languages]] spoken in northern Oaxaca (c. 120,000 speakers), and the nearly extinct [[Ixcatec language]] spoken in [[Santa María Ixcatlán]] (&lt; 8 speakers). The Popolocan languages should not be confused with the languages called [[Popoluca]] spoken in the state of [[Veracruz]], which belong to the unrelated [[Mixe–Zoquean languages|Mixe–Zoquean]] language family. The Mazatecan languages are known for their prolific use of [[whistled speech]].

====Zapotecan====
{{Main|Zapotecan languages}}
[[File:Zapotecan Languages.png|right|250px|thumb|The location of Zapotec dialect groups within the state of Oaxaca.]]
The [[Zapotecan languages|Zapotecan]] subgroup is formed by the [[Zapotec languages]] (c. 785,000 speakers of all varieties) and the related [[Chatino language]]s (c. 23,000 speakers). They are all traditionally spoken in central and southern Oaxaca, but have been spread throughout Mexico and even into the United States through recent labor related migrations.

Zapotec languages and dialects fall into four broad geographic divisions: Zapoteco de la Sierra Norte (Northern Zapotec), Valley Zapotec, Zapoteco de la Sierra Sur (Southern Zapotec), and [[Isthmus Zapotec]].  Northern Zapotec languages are spoken in the mountainous region of [[Oaxaca]], in the Northern Sierra Madre mountain ranges; Southern Zapotec languages and are spoken in the mountainous region of [[Oaxaca]], in the Southern Sierra Madre mountain ranges; Valley Zapotec languages are spoken in the Valley of Oaxaca, and Isthmus Zapotec languages are spoken in the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. The [[Ethnologue]] recognizes 57 varieties of Zapotec and 6 varieties of Chatino by distinct ISO codes.

====Mixtecan–Amuzgoan====
{{Main|List of Mixtecan languages}}
[[File:Mixteco y idiomas circundantes.svg|250px|thumb|right|Mixtec languages (in green) and its surrounding languages including Triqui, Cuicatec and Amuzgo within the state of Oaxaca.]]
The Mixtecan branch includes the many different, mutually unintelligible varieties of Mixtec spoken by about 511,000 people as well as the [[Trique language|Trique]] (or Triqui) languages, spoken by about 24,500 people and [[Cuicatec]], spoken by about 15,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;2000 census; the numbers are based on the number of total population for each group and the percentages of speakers given on the website of the Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas, http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=660, accessed 28 July 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The Mixtecan languages are traditionally spoken in the region known as [[La Mixteca]], which is shared by the [[Mexican states|states]] of [[Oaxaca]], [[Puebla]] and [[Guerrero]]. Because of migration from this region the Mixtecan languages have expanded to Mexico's main urban areas, particularly the [[State of México]] and the [[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]], to certain agricultural areas such as the [[San Quintín, Baja California|San Quintín]] valley in [[Baja California]] and parts of [[Morelos]] and [[Sonora]], and even into the [[United States]]. The Mixtec language is a complex set of regional varieties, many of which are not mutually intelligible. The varieties of Mixtec are sometimes grouped by geographic area, using designations such as those of the [[Mixteca Alta]], the [[Mixteca Baja]], and the [[Mixteca de la Costa]]. However, the dialects do not actually follow the geographic areas, and the precise historical relationships between the different varieties have not been worked out.&lt;ref&gt;See Josserand (1983) for one important attempt. Adaptations of Josserand's dialect maps are published in Macaulay 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of varieties of Mixtec depends in part on what the criteria are for grouping them, of course; at one extreme, government agencies once recognized no dialectal diversity. Mutual intelligibility surveys and local literacy programs have led [[SIL International]] to identify more than [[List of Mixtecan languages|50 varieties]] which have been assigned distinct ISO codes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/language_index.asp?letter=M "Ethnologue name language index"], ''Ethnologue'' web site, accessed 28 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four [[Amuzgo language|Amuzgo]] varieties are spoken in the [[Costa Chica of Guerrero|Costa Chica]] region of the states of [[Guerrero]] and [[Oaxaca]] by about 44,000 speakers.&lt;ref&gt;2005 census; {{cite web |url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mlen10&amp;c=3337 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722200402/http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mlen10&amp;c=3337 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four varieties recognized by the Mexican government are: [[Northern Amuzgo]] (amuzgo del norte, commonly known as Guerrero or (from its major town) Xochistlahuaca Amuzgo), Southern Amuzgo (amuzgo del sur, heretofore classified as a subdialect of Northern Amuzgo); Upper Eastern Amuzgo (amuzgo alto del este, commonly known as Oaxaca Amuzgo or San Pedro Amuzgos Amuzgo); Lower Eastern Amuzgo (amuzgo bajo del este, commonly known as Ipalapa Amuzgo). These varieties are very similar, but there is a significant difference between western varieties (Northern and Southern) and eastern varieties (Upper Eastern and Lower Eastern), as revealed by recorded text testing done in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Egland, Bartholomew &amp; Cruz Ramos, 1983:8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

===Common phonological traits ===
All Oto-Manguean languages have [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]]: some have only two [[Tone (linguistics)#Register and contour tones|level tones]] while others have up to five level tones. Many languages in addition have a number of [[Tone (linguistics)#Register and contour tones|contour tones]]. Many Oto-Manguean languages have phonemic vowel nasalization. Many Oto-Manguean languages lack [[labial consonant]]s, particularly stops and those that do have labial stops normally have these as a reflex of Proto-Oto-Manguean {{IPA|*/kʷ/}}.{{sfn|Sicoli|2005|p=798}}

===Syllable structure===
Proto-Oto-Manguean allowed only open syllables of the structure CV (or {{IPA|CVʔ}}). Syllable initial consonant clusters are very limited, usually only sibilant-CV, CyV, CwV, nasal-CV, ChV, or {{IPA|CʔV}} are allowed. Many modern Oto-Manguean languages keep these restrictions in syllable structure but others, most notably the Oto-Pamean languages, now allow both final clusters and long syllable initial clusters. This example with three initial and three final consonants is from [[Pame language|Northern Pame]]: '''{{IPA|/nlʔo&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;spt/}}''' "''their houses''".&lt;ref&gt;Suárez (1983, p.41)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonemes of Proto-Oto-Manguean===
The following phonemes are reconstructed for Proto-Oto-Manguean.&lt;ref&gt;Reconstruction follows that given by Rensch (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rensch also reconstructs four tones for Proto-Oto-Manguean.&lt;ref&gt;Rensch (1977, p.68)&lt;/ref&gt; A later revised reconstruction by [[Terrence Kaufman]]&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Campbell (1997, p.157)&lt;/ref&gt; adds the proto-phonemes */'''ts'''/, */'''{{IPA|θ}}'''/, */'''{{IPA|x}}'''/, */'''{{IPA|xʷ}}'''/, */'''{{IPA|l}}'''/, */'''{{IPA|r}}'''/, */'''{{IPA|m}}'''/ and */'''{{IPA|o}}'''/, and the vowel combinations */'''ia'''/, */'''ai'''/, */'''ea'''/, and */'''au'''/.

The Oto-Manguean languages have changed quite a lot from the very spartan phoneme inventory of Proto-Oto-Manguean. Many languages have rich inventories of both vowels and consonants. Many have a full series of fricatives, and some branches (particularly Zapotecan and Chinantecan) distinguish voicing in both stops and fricatives. The voiced series of the Oto-Pamean languages have both fricative and stop allophones. Otomian also have full series of front, central and back vowels. Some analyses of Mixtecan include a series of voiced prenasalised stops and affricates; these can also be analysed as consonant sequences but it would be the only consonant clusters known in the languages.

These are some of the most simple sound changes that have served to divide the Oto-Manguean family into subbranches:
:{{IPA|*/t/}} to {{IPA|/tʃ/}} in [[Chatino language|Chatino]]
:{{IPA|*/kʷ/}} to {{IPA|/p/}} in [[Chiapanec]]–Mangue, [[Oto-Pamean languages|Oto-Pame]], and [[Isthmus Zapotec]]
:{{IPA|*/s/}} to {{IPA|/θ/}} in [[Mixtecan languages|Mixtecan]]
:{{IPA|*/s/}} to {{IPA|/t/}} in [[Chatino language|Chatino]]
:{{IPA|*/w/}} to {{IPA|/o/}} before vowels in [[Oto-Pamean languages|Oto-Pame]]
:{{IPA|*/j/}} to {{IPA|/i/}} before vowels in [[Oto-Pamean languages|Oto-Pame]] and [[Amuzgo]]

===Tone systems===
The Oto-Manguean languages have a wide range of tonal systems, some with as many as 10 tone contrasts and others with only two. Some languages have a register system only distinguishing tones by the relative pitch. Others have a contour system that also distinguishes tones with gliding pitch. Most however are combinations of the register and contour systems. Tone as a distinguishing feature is entrenched in the structure of the Oto-Manguean languages and in no way a peripheral phenomenon as it is in some languages that are known to have acquired tone recently or which are in a process of losing it. In most Oto-Manguean languages tone serves to distinguish both between the meanings of roots and to indicate different grammatical categories. In Chiquihuitlan [[Mazatecan languages|Mazatec]] which has four tones the following minimal pairs occur: ''{{IPA|tʃa}}&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' "I talk", ''{{IPA|tʃa}}²'' "difficult", ''{{IPA|tʃa}}³'' "his hand" ''{{IPA|tʃa}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'' "he talks".&lt;ref name="Suaréz 1983, p.51"&gt;Suaréz (1983, p.51)&lt;/ref&gt;

The language with the most level tones is Usila [[Chinantec]] which has five level tones and no contour tones; [[Trique language|Trique]] of Chicahuaxtla has a similar system.&lt;ref name="Suaréz 1983, p.51"/&gt;
[[File:Chinantec.png|250px|center]]

In Copala [[Trique language|Trique]], which has a mixed system, only three level tones but five tonal registers are distinguished within the contour tones.
[[File:Triquetones.png|350px|center]]

Many other systems have only three tones levels, such as [[Tlapanec language|Tlapanec]] and Texmelucan [[Zapotec language|Zapotec]].
[[File:Tlapanec-tone-system.png|350px|left]]
[[File:Threetonesystemtexmelucan.png|180px|center]]

Particularly common in the [[Oto-Pamean languages|Oto-Pamean branch]] are small tonal systems with only two level tones and one combination, such as [[Pame language|Pame]] and [[Otomi language|Otomi]]. Some others like [[Matlatzinca language|Matlatzinca]] and [[Chichimeca Jonaz language|Chichimeca Jonaz]] only have the level tones and no combination.
[[File:Twotoneotomangue.png|500px|center]]

In some languages stress influences tone, for example in Pame only stressed syllables have a tonal contrast. In Chatino where stress falls predictably on the last syllable of polysyllables, tone is also only distinguished on the last syllable. In Mazahua the opposite occurs and all syllables except the final stressed one distinguishes tone. In Tlapanec stress is determined by the tonal contour of the words. Most languages have systems of [[Tone sandhi|sandhi]] where the tones of a word or syllable are influenced by other tones in other syllables or words. Chinantec has no Sandhi rules but Mixtec and Zapotec have elaborate systems. For Mazatec some dialects has elaborate Sandhi systems (e.g. Soyaltepec) and others have not (e.g. Huautla Mazatec). Some languages (particularly Mixtecan) also have [[Tone terracing|terrace systems]] where some tones are "[[upstep]]" or "[[downstep]]", causing a raise or drop in pitch level for the entire tonal register in subsequent syllables.

===Whistled speech===
Several Oto-Manguean languages have systems of [[Whistled language|whistled speech]], where by whistling the tonal combinations of words and phrases, information can be transmitted over distances without using words. Whistled speech is particularly common in Chinantec, Mazatec and Zapotecan languages.

'''Pejeng drum''' (also Pejeng-type drum) is a type of Bronze Age kettledrum which was produced across the archipelago of [[Indonesia]] between the 1st and 2nd century AD. They are one of Indonesia's finest example of metalworking.{{sfn|Bellwood|2001|p=39}} Examples of Bronze Age Pejeng drum, such as the ancient [[Moon of Pejeng]], is the largest [[bronze drum]] in the world, indicating the advance of metal casting technique and the active trade in the archipelago in the first millennium AD.

==Archaeology==
[[File:MET 29G A30R4.jpg|thumb|right|The separately-cast head (the tympanum) of a Pejeng-type drum found in [[Sumba]].]]
The first record of the use of bronze and iron in the Indonesian archipelago was around 500 BC. Most of the earliest bronze objects were probably used for ceremonies e.g. [[Indonesian bronze age axes|highly-stylized axes]] and [[kettledrum]]s. Some drums were shaped in a form known as the [[Dong Son drum|Dong Son]], a type of bronze drum which originate from northern Vietnam and are spread along the [[Sunda Islands]] e.g. [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], [[Nusa Tenggara]] and even as far as the [[Kai Islands]] near [[Papua (province)|Papua]]. The spread of the Dong Son drum in the Indonesian archipelago indicates an extensive trade among the kingdoms in [[Southeast Asia]] during the period. Other bronze drums found in the archipelago represented local variation, the most well-known of these are the Pejeng drums.{{sfn|Bellwood|2001|p=39}}

The Pejeng drums, named after the Bronze Age village of [[Pejeng]] in [[Bali]], were the [[Nusantara|Indonesian]] variation of the Dong Son drum. Pejeng drums differ from the earlier [[Dong Son drum]] in that they had a more elongated shape and were made in two pieces (mantles and tympana) cast separately using the lost wax method. Pejeng drum was designed in the Indonesian archipelago and was produced extensively in the island of [[Java]] and [[Bali]] in the first millennium AD. The Balinese variation is among the most impressive metal artifact in the late prehistoric period of Indonesia. The [[Moon of Pejeng]] kept in the village of Pejeng, is the largest Pejeng drum in the world. Such enormous drum would have had great social value for the owners. Neither copper nor tin, the raw materials for bronze making, are available in Bali. The existence of huge bronze drums in Bali indicates an intensive inter-island trade between Bali and other parts of Indonesia during the first millennium AD. Trade was also more expansive in Bali, as pottery decorated with Indian-styled rouletted designs, were found at Sembiran and [[Pacung]] in the north part of Bali, indicating a trade as far as India within the archipelago in the 1st or 2nd centuries AD.{{sfn|I Wayan Kartika|2001|p=43}}

Pejeng drums may have been used as a regalia by kings or chiefs who wanted to be considered an international elite. At [[Plawangan]], a Pejeng drum was found in burials, together with other precious objects e.g. gold necklace and iron spearhead. In Bali, the [[Moon of Pejeng]], the largest drum of this type, was simply kept in villages.{{sfn|I Wayan Kartika|2001|p=43}} The [[Moko drum]] of Alor, a Pejeng-type drum, are still used as heirloom objects which are exchanged in marriage ceremonies.

==Appearance and construction==
[[File:MET 2001 433 93 O1 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Pejeng drum.]]
A Pejeng drum has a symmetrical appearance. Its shape consists of three parts: the head or the tympanum at the top, the middle barrel where the handle is attached, and the base. The design difference between the Pejeng drum and the Dong Son drum is that the tympanum protrudes around {{convert|25|cm|inch}} beyond the body, and was cast separately from it.{{sfn|I Wayan Kartika|2001|p=43}}

Pejeng drums were made using [[lost-wax casting]]. Another difference with the [[Dong Son drum]] is that the body and tympana of the Pejeng drum were sometimes cast separately instead of as a whole. A wax model in the shape of a drum was made around a hollow clay core. The standardized geometric pattern of human or animal were impressed into the wax using incised stone molds. The geometric patterns were molded onto for the tympana and the upper sides.{{sfn|Bellwood|2001|p=38}}

'''Qingdao dialect''' is the local dialect of the city of [[Qingdao]] and nearby towns, in China's [[Shandong]] Province.

Often characterized as requiring a "fat tongue", the Qingdao dialect often adds a /{{IPA|θ}}/ ("th") sound to [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]'s /{{IPA|ʂ}}/ ("sh"), /{{IPA|ɕ}}/ ("x"), and /{{IPA|s}}/ ("s"). It also obliterates many Mandarin tones.

The basic, though not at all universal rule for converting Putonghua to the Qingdao dialect in the [[pinyin]] system is that a Mandarin 1 tone will become a Qingdao 3, 2 becomes a 4, 3 becomes 1 and 4 remains four. Qingdao dialect's 1 tone (Mandarin's 3) also has a drawl to it. (the pinyin tones are: 1ˉ 2ˊ 3ˇ  4ˋ)

There are other phonetic changes from Mandarin to the Qingdao dialect:

*"gá •la" (蛤蜊), the local spicy [[clam]] dish, known in Mandarin as "gé •li"
*"hā pì jiū" (喝啤酒), drink [[beer]]
*"bài dào •dao" (别叨叨), meaning "no need to say more", but better understood to mean "shut up". Literally translated as "don't blather on".
*"Zhei Ba (窄巴), narrow (窄 is pronounced as Zhei in Qingdao dialect, different from Zhai in Putonghua) 
*"Biao (彪)/ Chao (嘲)/ Ban Xian (半仙)/ Yu (愚), stupid &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yi Ching|first1=Leung|title=17 verbal flavors of Shandong: the 101 guide to the dialects of Shandong|url=https://www.zentopia-culture.com/single-post/2017/02/18/17-verbal-flavors-of-Shandong-the-101-guide-to-the-dialects-of-Shandong|website=www.zentopia-culture.com/|publisher=Leung Yi Ching|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all Qingdao natives can understand Mandarin, but they will often respond in the Qingdao dialect without realizing they are doing so. The Qingdao dialect is not necessarily standardized throughout Qingdao. Different neighbourhoods, from [[Zhanshan]] to [[Xinjiazhuang]] to [[Maidao]], will have their own variations.

Qingdao's urban dialect words originated between the 1940s and the 1960s. It has slowly developed its own "-isms" and slang over the years.

The '''Revisionist school of Islamic studies''', (also '''Historical-Critical school of Islamic studies''') is a movement within Islamic studies which started in the 1970s and initiated a [[paradigm shift]] in Islamic Studies.&lt;ref&gt;François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, S. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, edited by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Stille: [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/02/arts/scholars-are-quietly-offering-new-theories-of-the-koran.html?pagewanted=all Scholars Are Quietly Offering New Theories of the Koran], New York Times 02 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main thesis and the concept of Revisionism ==

The core concern of the Revisionist School is to finally show consequence concerning the knowledge, practically available since [[Ignác Goldziher]]'s time, that the traditional Islamic accounts about [[Islam]]'s early times - written 150 to 200 years after Muhammad - are highly questionable as historical sources. This relates to [[Muhammad]]'s biography, the formation history of the [[Quran]], and the historical developments under the first Islamic dynasty, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. The true historical events in the earliest times of Islam have to be newly researched and reconstructed by applying the [[historical criticism|historical-critical method]].&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The designation ''Revisionism'' was coined first by the opponents of the new academic movement and is used by them partially still today with a dismissive undertone.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, S. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010. Judith Herrin, [https://www.opendemocracy.net/judith-herrin/patricia-crone-brief-memoir Patricia Crone: memoir of a superb Islamic Scholar], openDemocracy 12 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the media took up this designation in order to call the new movement with a concise catchword.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ ''What is the Koran?''], in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Today, also the adherents of the new movement use ''Revisionism'' to designate themselves, yet mostly written in quotation marks and with a slightly self-mocking undertone.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Patricia Crone: [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/42023/among-the-believers Among the Believers], Tablet Magazine 10 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== The major representatives ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
The new movement originated at the [[SOAS, University of London]] by two publications of [[John Wansbrough]]: ''Quranic Studies'' (1977) and ''The Sectarian Milieu'' (1978). Among the students of Wansbrough are: [[Andrew Rippin]], [[Norman Calder]], [[G. R. Hawting]], [[Patricia Crone]] and [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]]. With their work ''Hagarism'' (1977) Patricia Crone and Michael Cook set a milestone in Islamic Studies, since by provocative theses they provided maximal attention in the academic community. Later, both distanced themselves from their too far reaching theses in ''[[Hagarism]]''. Yet they adhered to the basically new academic approach. [[Martin Hinds]], too, studied at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. [[Robert G. Hoyland]] is a student of Patricia Crone.

A second local focus of the new movement is at the [[Saarland University]] in [[Saarbrücken]], Germany ({{ill|Saarbrücker Schule|de}}). Since the 1970s there is a focus on the historical-critical research of the development of the Quran, by [[Günter Lüling]] und [[Gerd R. Puin|Gerd-Rüdiger Puin]]. Also in Saarbrücken, [[Karl-Heinz Ohlig]] developed in the 2000s together with [[Volker Popp]], [[Christoph Luxenberg]] and [[Markus Groß]] a theory of Islam's earliest times which has no need for Muhammad as a historical person.

Further representatives are: [[Hans Jansen]] from the Netherlands who in 2005/7 published a work showing in detail why the known accounts of Muhammad's life are legends only. [[Yehuda D. Nevo]] published in 2003 his work ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' in which he denies the historicity of Muhammad. [[James A. Bellamy]] is known for his textual criticism of the Quran and for his proposals of emendations, i.e. proposals to correct the traditional text of the Quran. [[Fred Donner]] published in 2010 the first well-founded hypothesis on the early time of Islam without excessive exaggerations which found public attention.

[[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]] studied history and became a renowned author of popular science publications on ancient history. With his work ''[[In the Shadow of the Sword (book)|In the Shadow of the Sword]]'' (2012) Tom Holland contributed heavily to the popularization of the new research results. Tom Holland depicts a possible synthesis of the various revisionist approaches, thus having like Fred Donner provided a well-founded hypothesis of Islam's early times which avoids exaggerations.

[[Sven Kalisch]] is a German Islamic theologian who rejected teaching Islamic theology without considering the new results of historical-critical research. Thereupon the German Islamic associations withdrew his allowance to teach future Islamic theologians and teachers. Later Kalisch left Islam. Today he is teaching the history of ideas in the Near East in Late Antiquity in [[Münster]].

== The thesis of the incredibility of the traditional Islamic accounts ==
The arguments against the credibility of the classical Islamic traditions about Islam's beginnings were e.g. summarized by Prof. [[Hans Jansen]] in his work ''De Historische Mohammed''. Jansen discusses chapter by chapter the depictions in the prophet's biography by [[Ibn Ishaq]] resp. [[Ibn Hisham]] which is an important text for traditional Islam. Jansen reveals self-contradictions, contradictions to other historical sources, embellishments by later authors, politically or theologically motivated distortions of the depiction, symbolic meanings of allegedly historical names, literary construction of the depiction according e.g. to biblical models, and chronological and calendrical incredibilities.

Some examples:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jansen, ''De Historische Mohammed'', 2005/7&lt;/ref&gt;

* Although there were [[leap month]]s at the time of Muhammad which had to be intercalated frequently into the moon calendar and which only later became abandoned (allegedly by Muhammad), not a single of the many most accurately dated events depicted by Ibn Ishaq is in a leap month.
* The most accurate dating of so many events by an author who writes 150 years later is not very credible.
* The depiction of a strong relationship between Muhammad and his wife Aisha is motivated politically resp. theologically: [[Aisha]] was the daughter of [[Abu Bakr]], who became Muhammad's successor against the claims of his rival, [[Ali]]. In order to legitimate this succession against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]], who were in favour of Ali, the relationship of Abu Bakr's daughter to Muhammad became emphasized: That Aisha allegedly was the favourite wife of Muhammad, and that the prophet consummated marriage with Aisha allegedly at an astonishingly early age. 
* The depiction of slaughtering the Jewish tribe of the [[Banu Qurayza]] is motivated politically resp. theologically: As the "[[Constitution of Medina|treaty of Medina]]" shows, the Jews were initially part of the [[Umma]] and were addressed as "believers"; cf. the research of Prof. [[Fred Donner]]. When Islam later separated from Judaism, [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] readings of the past came into being. The threefold treason of Muhammad by three Jewish tribes is a literary construction according to biblical models, e.g. the threefold treason of Jesus by the apostle Peter, and thus is historically questionable. There are other traditions about the same event which tell that only the leaders of the tribe had been punished but not each single member of the tribe. The names of the three Jewish tribes do not occur in the "treaty of Medina". Finally, such an mass slaughtering would not have gone unnoticed, even not in Muhammad's time, and especially not considering that the victims were Jews: Jews used to live in international trading networks, and Jews are known to write down their history. Most likely, the slaughtering of the Banu Quraiza never happened.
* The depictions of Ibn Ishaq are generally known to boldly exaggerate the capacities of the prophet. According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad always kills more enemies than according to other traditions. Even the depiction of he prophet's male potency (who allegedly could satisfy all his wives in one night) is exaggerated in a questionable way. Of the same category is the depiction of Muhammad as an illiterate person. The [[revelation]] of the [[Quran]]ic text is all the more miraculous and the capacity of the prophet is all the more astonishing if Muhammad was an illiterate person.
* The account of [[Muhammad's letters to the Heads-of-State]] including the emperor of Byzantium, that they should convert to Islam, retrospectively justifies the Arabic expansion as a religious, Islamic expansion.

Jansen points out that the historically questionable traditions are of great importance for the interpretation of the Quran. The Quran mostly does not reveal the situation for which a revelation was made. The historical context is merely indicated, at best. Many Islamic traditions came into being long after Muhammad on the basis of mere guesses for what situation a Quranic verse had been revealed. Because these historically questionable traditions, the interpretation of the Quran has been restricted ever since.

In her work ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam'' Patricia Crone gave a general examination of the credibility of Islamic traditions. This examination is much cited in literature yet discusses only a few aspects of Muhammad's biography meant to be exemplary for the nature of all the Islamic traditions. Concerning the encounter of the young Muhammad with Jews who recognize him as a prophet, and other stories, Patricia Crone writes: ''""These stories are no different from those on Muhammad's encounter with Jews and others. Being non-miraculous, they do not violate any laws of nature, of course, and in that sense they could be true. In fact, they are clearly not. [...] We cannot even tell whether there ''was'' an original event: in the case of Muhammad's encounter with the Jews and others there was not. Either a fictitious theme has acquired reality thanks to the activities of storytellers or else a historical event has been swamped by these activities."''&lt;ref name="crone-encounter"&gt;Patricia Crone: Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam, 1987, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

== The new theses about the true beginnings of Islam ==
Starting point for all researchers is the awareness that the traditional Islamic accounts about Islam's beginnings which came into being only 150 to 200 years after Muhammad are highly questionable as historical sources.{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} The true events in early Islamic times have to be newly researched and reconstructed with the help of the historical-critical method. In the following the theses of the revisionists in broad outline:

* The Quranic text as is in use today shows many differences to the earliest existing manuscripts. A core part of the Quran may derive from Muhammad's annunciations, yet some parts of the Quran were definitively added later resp. were reworked later. In addition to that many small deviations came into the text as usual with ancient texts which were manually copied and copied again.&lt;ref&gt;John Wansbrough: ''Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation'' (1977) pp. 43 ff.; Gerd-Rüdiger Puin: ''Observations on Early Qur'an Manuscripts in San’a’'', in: Stefan Wild (Hrsg.): The Qur’an as Text. Brill, Leiden 1996; pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;
* The existence and meaning of the prophet Muhammad as a historical person depends especially with the question whether any and how many parts of the Quran can be attributed to his time, or, whether all or most parts of the Quran came into being only after Muhammad's time. The researchers' opinions differ in this question.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda D. Nevo: ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' (2003); Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Donner suggests an early date for the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: ''Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing'' (1998), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Quran is not written in a "pure" Arabic yet the syriac Aramaic language seems to have a certain influence on the language of the Quran which was forgotten later. This could be a possible explanation why a fifth of the Quranic text is difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007) pp. 377 ff.; Christoph Luxenberg: ''The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran – A Contribution to the Decoding of the Koran'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Islam did not rise among polytheistic pagans in the desert, yet in a milieu where Jewish and Christian texts were well-known. The "infidels" were no pagan polytheists yet monotheists who were considered to deviate slightly from monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Hawting: ''The Idea of Idolatry and the Rise of Islam: From Polemic to History'' (1999); Fred Donner: ''Muhammad and the Believers. At the Origins of Islam'' (2010) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
* The geographical descriptions in the Quran and later traditions do not fit to Mecca. They rather point to  a place somewhere in north-western Arabia, e.g. to Petra in Jordania.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: ''Hagarism'' (1977) pp. 22-24; Patricia Crone: ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam'' (1987); and the private researcher Dan Gibson: ''Quranic Geography'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The connection of Muslims and Jews was very close in the early times of Islam. Also Jews were called "believers" and were part of the umma. Antisemitic texts as e.g. the slaughtering of the Jewish tribe of the Banu Qurayza came into being long after Muhammad when Islam separated from Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: ''Muhammad and the Believers. At the Origins of Islam'' (2010) pp. 68 ff.; cf. also Hans Jansen: Mohammed (2005/7) pp. 311-317 (German edition 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the beginning, secular and spiritual power were united in the person of the caliph. There were no special religious scholars. Religious scholars came into being only later and conquered the spiritual power from the caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Martin Hinds: ''God's Caliph: Religious Authority in the First Centuries of Islam'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Islamic expansion probably was no Islamic, religiously motivated expansion, yet a secular, Arabic expansion. The expansion did not yet result in an oppression of the non-Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Hoyland: ''In God's Path. The Arab Conquests and the Creation of an Islamic Empire'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
* After Muhammad there were at least two phases which were of major importance for the formation of Islam in its later shape:
** Under the Umayyad caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem was built. There the word "Islam" appears for the first time. Until this moment the Muslims called themselves simply "believers", and coins ware minted in the Arabic empire showing Christian symbols. Abd al-Malik also plays a major role in the reworking of the Quranic text.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: ''Hagarism'' (1977) p. 29; Yehuda D. Nevo: ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' (2003) pp. 410-413; Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007) pp. 336 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
** During the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], practically all Islamic traditional texts about Islam's beginnings were written. The Abbasids as the victorious party in the conflict with the Umayyads had great interest to legitimize their rule. This motivation obviously crept into the traditional texts.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone: ''Slaves on Horses. The Evolution of the Islamic Polity'' (1980) pp. 7, 12, 15; auch Hans Jansen: ''Mohammed'' (2005/7)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of Revisionism ==

The consequent historical-critical analysis of early Islam met severe resistance in the beginning since then provocative theses with far-reaching meaning were published without sufficient evidence. Especially Patricia Crone's and Michael Cook's book ''Hagarism'' (1977) stirred up a lot of harsh criticism. Important representatives of Revisionism like Patricia Crone or Michael Cook meanwhile distanced themselves from such radical theses and uncautious publications.
&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ ''What is the Koran?''], in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism is expressed by researchers like [[Tilman Nagel]], who aims at the speculative nature of some theses and shows that some revisionists lack some scholarly standards. On the other hand, Nagel accepts the basic impulse of the new movement, to put more emphasis on the application of the historical-critical method.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Tilman Nagel: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/rezensionen/sachbuch/islamwissenschaft-befreit-den-propheten-aus-seiner-religioesen-umklammerung-1464313.html Befreit den Propheten aus seiner religiösen Umklammerung!] in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 21 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
A certain tendency to take revisionists seriously becomes obvious e.g. by the fact that opponents address their criticism not any longer to "revisionism" alone but to "extreme revisionism" or "ultra-revisionism".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Marion Holmes Katz: [https://books.google.de/books?id=xI_7uosa4FMC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;ots=EMLqEHO3nI&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Body of Text: The Emergence of the Sunni Law of Ritual Purity] (2012), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregor Schoeler]] discusses the revisionist school and depicts the early controversies. Schoeler considers revisionism to be too radical yet welcomes the general impulse: "To have made us thinking about this all and much more remarkable things for the first time -- or again, is without any doubt a merit of the new generation of the 'skeptics'."&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Schoeler, ''Charakter und Authentie der muslimischen Überlieferung über das Leben Mohammeds'', de Gruyter 1996. pp. 18 f., 23 f. 142 f.; original citation p. 24: "dies alles und noch manches Beachtenswerte mehr uns zum ersten Mal -- oder erneut -- zu bedenken gegeben zu haben, ist zweifellos ein Verdienst der neuen Generation der 'Skeptiker'."&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance comes partly from older academics who still live in their thoughts in the world of the Islamic legends.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/rezensionen/rezension-tilman-nagel-eine-sackgasse-ohlig/ Review of: Mohammed. Leben und Legende, by Tilman Nagel], in:  imprimatur No. 41, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] in his famous work [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] (1962) described, a new paradigm prevails in academia often not by convincing current academics but by convincing the next generation of academics.

Continuous resistance against the new paradigm comes from researchers who fundamentally reject the application of the historical-critical method to Islamic texts. They argue that this method was developed for Christian texts and thus there is no reason to apply this method to Islamic texts, too. Adherents of Revisionism doubt whether this still is a scientific point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, p. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== A challenge for reflection and reform to Islam ==
{{POV check|section|date=October 2016}}
The [[relationship between religion and science]] had always been shaped by conflicts...{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} It is always a hurting process for every religion to realize that parts of its teachings were wrong: at the beginning, new scientific results are often considered to be an attack on religion itself;{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} only later is it realized that religion can live with the new findings, so long as the religion's core is not affected, and things are sorted out in the way of religious [[reform]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison (ed.): The Cambridge Companion to Science and Religion (2010) pp. 292 f. - Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/islam-und-islamismus-zur-gegenwaertigen-diskussion/ Islam und Islamismus], in: imprimatur No. 48, 2015, pp. 48-53&lt;/ref&gt;

By nature new findings about the early times of Islam touch the identity of the Islamic religion. Thus it is a justified claim of religious people that any research concerning their religion has to progress with high diligence and cautiousness in order to avoid unnecessary irritations. At the same time it is a justified claim by academics that they can do their research freely and without any restraint, even if the results run contrary to religious teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/wissenschaftliches-arbeiten-in-der-islamwissenschaft/ Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten in der Islamwissenschaft], in: imprimatur No. 41, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The gravity of irritation provided to Islam depends on the question whether core teachings of Islam are touched or not, especially the historicity of Muhammad and the attribution of the Quran to Muhammad.{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} According to this question, the historical-critical school can roughly be divided into two groups (for details see the researchers' articles):
* As far as the research results do not deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly in Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is left untouched. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: [[Patricia Crone]], [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]], [[Fred Donner]], [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]], [[Günter Lüling]].
* As far as the research results do deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly after Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is put into question. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: [[John Wansbrough]], [[Hans Jansen]], [[Karl-Heinz Ohlig]], [[Yehuda D. Nevo]].

Besides the discussion of the historicity of Muhammad as a historical person and the Quranic text attributed to him, Islam faces the following debates:&lt;ref&gt;Salwa Ismail: The Politics of Historical Revisionism: New Re-Readings of the Early Islamic Period, in: Michaelle Browers, Charles Kurzman (ed).: An Islamic Reformation?, Lexington Books (2004), pp. 101-124; especially p. 114 and footnotes 43, 44. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/islam-und-islamismus-zur-gegenwaertigen-diskussion/ Islam und Islamismus], in: imprimatur No. 48, 2015, pp. 48-53&lt;/ref&gt;
* Traditional texts which had shaped Islam for centuries - yet ''not'' from the beginning - are not true.
* The Quranic text has not been handed down to our times unchanged.
* Even in the Quran, God's word is in many respects clothed in human words.
* Muhammad did not live in Mecca.
* The relationship between Muhammad and Jews and Christians was different than always thought it had been.

==Revisionism by non-specialists==
[[Ibn Warraq]], an author known for his criticism of Islam, has complied several revisionist essays in his book, ''[[The Quest for the Historical Muhammad (Ibn Warraq)|The Quest for the Historical Muhammad]].'' [[Fred Donner]], reviewing the book, notes that by favoring Wansbrough school of revisionism, the author presents a "one-sided selection" that fails to consider the challenges to this line of revisionism. The results is "a book that is likely to mislead many an unwary general reader."&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-middle-east-studies/article/the-quest-for-the-historical-muhammad-edited-and-translated-by-warraqibn-554-pages-glossary-list-of-tribes-and-individuals-chronology-amherst-ny-prometheus-books-2000-3495-cloth-isbn-1-57392-787-2/4C3D7FD138EF645D933ADDB0BCB33D6B Review of: The Quest for the Historical Muhammad, by Ibn Warraq],  Middle East Studies Association Bulletin, 35(1), pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Spencer (author)|Robert Spencer]], in this book ''Did Muhammad Exist? An Inquiry Into Islam's Obscure Origins,'' advances the thesis that Islam was a state-religion created by the [[Abbasids]] to justify the empire.

'''Siyah mashq''' (Persian: ) lit. "black practice", are [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] practice sheets often covered completely with writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Selections of Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman Calligraphy|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?intldl/ascsbib:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28ascs000042%29%29|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may include a number of diagonal words and letters used in combinations facing upwards and downwards on the folio. Siyah mashq was originally just a practice for the calligrapher to warm up his hand and to refine the shape of letters by repeating them over and over. These practices resulted in a page filled with words and letters. When calligraphers realised how stunning some of these pieces where it was turned into a style of its own. Words and letters are repeated regardless of meaning, all for the sake of composition and style.

As an established [[genre]], practice sheets abide to certain rules of formal [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]s, largely guided by rhythm and repetition. Although siyah mashq sheets survive from ca. 1600, they seem to have been a particularly popular genre during the second half of the 19th century, i.e., during the artistic revival spearheaded by the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] ruler [[Nasir al-Din Shah]], who reigned from 1848 to 1896.

'''''Soleil dans le ciel de Saint-Paul''''' ([[French language|French]] for "'''Sun in the sky of Saint-Paul'''") is a [[painting]] in oil on canvas, 73 × 115.5&amp;nbsp;cm, created in 1983 by Russian-French artist [[Marc Chagall]]. It is held in a private collection.

==The painting==

The painting depicts the recognisable view of [[Saint-Paul-de-Vence]], one of the oldest medieval towns on the French Riviera, dominated by the church at its top. The work is particularly rich in color and has a very balanced composition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/welt_print/article1026325/Millionenpreise-fuer-Chagalls-Spaetwerk-bei-Kornfeld-in-Bern.html ''MIllionenpreise für Chagalls Spätwerk bei Kornfeld in Bern''] Die Welt July 14th 2007. Retrieved 31 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The blue sky above the town contains a large, bright yellow sun as well as various other elements from the artist’s iconography – animals, musicians and the flying couple. By juxtaposing this imagery, Soleil dans le ciel de Saint-Paul combines Chagall’s love of his Mediterranean home with his characteristic dream-like pictorial vision. With its free-flowing style and bright, translucent colours, the work exemplifies the effect that the south of France had on Chagall’s art.&lt;ref name=Sothebys&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/impressionist-modern-art-evening-sale-l14002/lot.81.html Impressionist, Modern &amp; Surrealist Art Evening Sale] Sotheby's London. Retrieved 31 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘The Southern French landscape has astonished Chagall with its wealth of colours and its lyrical atmosphere, had captivated him with the beauty of its flowers and foliage. These impressions found their way into his paintings of that period, refined their peinture and lent them a hitherto unknown radiance’.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Erben. "Marc Chagall". London, 1957, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

With its fantastical, dream-like composition, the painting becomes an expression of the artist’s internal feelings and souvenirs rather than an objective projection of the outside world and of the familiar landscape. As such, Chagall’s paintings defy symbolic meaning and categorisation. In particular, his dreamscapes resist interpretation despite the ubiquity of repeated pictorial symbols; through repetition they become both familiar and meaningless, manifestations of a rich and colourful imagination that can be understood not through intellect but through intuition.&lt;ref name="Sothebys"/&gt; As the artist himself proclaimed: ‘For me a picture is a surface covered with representations of things (objects, animals, human beings) in a certain order in which logic and illustration have no importance. The visual effect of the composition is what is paramount’.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Compton. "Chagall (exhibition catalogue)". Royal Academy of Arts, London, 1985, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1920sportsuit.jpg|thumb|Woman wearing a "sport suit," American, June 1920. Sportswear originally described interchangeable separates, as here.]]
'''Sportswear''' is an American fashion term originally used to describe separates, but which, since the 1930s, has come to be applied to day and evening fashions of varying degrees of formality that demonstrate a specific relaxed approach to their design, while remaining appropriate for a wide range of social occasions. The term is not necessarily synonymous with [[Sportswear (activewear)|activewear]], clothing designed specifically for participants in sporting pursuits. Although sports clothing was available from European [[haute couture]] houses and "sporty" garments were increasingly worn as everyday or informal wear, the early American sportswear designers were associated with ready-to-wear manufacturers. While most fashions in America in the early 20th century were directly copied from, or influenced heavily by Paris, American sportswear became a home-grown exception to this rule, and could be described as the '''American Look'''. Sportswear was designed to be easy to look after, with accessible fastenings that enabled a modern [[emancipation of women|emancipated woman]] to dress herself without a [[lady's maid|maid]]'s assistance.

==Definition==
Sportswear has been called America's main contribution to the [[history of fashion design]],&lt;ref name=fdf&gt;{{cite book| last = Calasibetta| first = Charlotte Mankey| title = Fairchild's Dictionary of Fashion (2nd edition)| publisher = Fairchild Publications, New York| year = 1988| pages =545| ISBN = 1-56367-235-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed to cater to the needs of the increasingly fast-paced lifestyle of American women.&lt;ref name=nyf&gt;{{cite book |last=Stanfill |first=Sonnet |title=New York Fashion |publisher=V&amp;A Publications, London |year=2007 |pages=28–49| ISBN = 978-1-85177-499-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started out as a fashion industry term describing informal and interchangeable separates (i.e., blouses, shirts, skirts and shorts),&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt; and in the 1920s became a popular word for relaxed, casual wear typically worn for [[spectator sport]]s.&lt;ref name=fdf/&gt; Since the 1930s the term has been used to describe both day and evening fashions of varying degrees of formality that demonstrate this relaxed approach while remaining appropriate wear for many business or social occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sportswear "Sportswear"]. Dictionary.com. ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. (accessed: March 11, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The curator [[Richard Martin (curator)|Richard Martin]] put on an exhibition on sportswear in 1985 at the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]], in which he described sportswear as "an American invention, an American industry, and an American expression of style."&lt;ref name=martin&gt;{{cite book |author1=Richard Martin |authorlink1=Richard Martin (curator)|editor1-last=Martin |editor1-first=Richard |editor1-link=Richard Martin (curator) |title=All-American: A Sportswear Tradition|publisher=Fashion Institute of Technology |pages=8–21 |language=en |chapter=All American: A Sportswear Tradition}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Martin, American sportswear was an expression of various predominantly middle-class aspects of American culture, including health ideals, the concept of democracy, ideas of comfort and function, and innovative design which might refer to historical concepts or leisure attributes.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; The establishment of a five-day working week and an eight-hour working day in America in the mid-20th century led to the need for clothing which enabled the fullest possible enjoyment of such increased leisure time, and was designed accordingly.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; A subsequent exhibition of 1930s-70s sportswear, also curated by Martin, at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1998, was introduced by [[Philippe de Montebello]] as showing pioneering garments, whose modesty, comparative simplicity, and wearability treated fashion as a "pragmatic art."&lt;ref name=montebello&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Montebello|first1=Philippe|authorlink1=Philippe de Montebello|editor1-last=Martin|editor1-first=Richard |editor1-link=Richard Martin (curator)|title=American ingenuity : sportswear, 1930s - 1970s |date=1998 |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York |isbn=9780870998638 |pages=7–8 |url=http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/42547|chapter=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Montebello carefully explained how significant American designers such as [[Norman Norell]], [[Pauline Trigère]], [[Charles James (designer)|Charles James]] and [[Mainbocher]], were not considered sportswear designers, as they were not dedicated to the design principles of versatility, accessibility and affordability in the way that [[Claire McCardell]] or [[Emily Wilkens]] were.&lt;ref name=montebello/&gt;

The "American Look," which is an alternative term for American sportswear, was coined in 1932 by [[Lord &amp; Taylor]] executive [[Dorothy Shaver]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hDkVCwAAQBAJ|title=Clothing and Fashion: American Fashion from Head to Toe |last=F|first=José Blanco|last2=Hunt-Hurst|first2=Patricia Kay|last3=Lee|first3=Heather Vaughan |last4=Doering |first4=Mary |date=2015-11-23 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781610693103|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of sportswear design==
[[File:Redfern suit and rugby players 1914.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Pre-sportswear tailormade by Redfern. ''[[La Gazette du Bon Ton|Bon Ton]]'', April 1914.]]

===Pre-1920===
Sportswear originally described activewear - clothing made specifically for sport. Part of the evolution of sportswear was triggered by 19th-century developments in female activewear, such as early bathing or cycling costumes, which demanded shorter skirts, [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]], and other specific garments to enable mobility, whilst sports such as tennis or [[croquet]] could be played in barely-modified conventional dress.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; One of the first couturiers to specialise in sports-specific clothing was the British [[Redfern (couture)|John Redfern]] who in the 1870s began designing tailored garments for increasingly active women who [[equestrianism|rode]], played [[tennis]], went [[yachting]], and did [[archery]]. Redfern's clothes, although intended for specific sporting pursuits, were adopted as everyday wear by his clients, making him probably the first sportswear designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walking costume by Redfern |url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O154069/walking-costume-redfern-john/|website=V&amp;A Search the Collections |publisher=V&amp;A Museum |accessdate=24 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the late nineteenth century, garments associated with activewear and/or modified from menswear, such as the [[shirt]]waist began to form part of the working woman's wardrobe.&lt;ref name=arnoldorigin&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnold |first1=Rebecca |title=The American look : fashion, sportswear and the image of women in 1930s and 1940s New York |date=2008 |publisher=I. B.

Martin has observed that in America, prior to increasing worker freedoms from the mid-late 19th century onwards, leisure had been a luxury available only to the leisured classes during the [[Industrial Revolution]] (c.1760-1860), and before that, [[History of the Puritans in North America|Puritan America]] had condemned leisure for all. He cites the 1884 [[Georges Seurat]] painting ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'' as an immobile, "static and stratified" depiction of leisure in "direct antithesis" of the relaxed, casual American equivalent.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; T.J. Clarke notes how ''La Grande Jatte'' illustrates people from the breadth of Paris society taking advantage of their free time by going to the riverside to show off new clothes, but that the act of removing one's jacket or otherwise loosening garments as a signifier of actually being at leisure was almost never done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=T.

===1920s===
While 1920s Paris designers offered [[haute couture]] designs that could be considered sportswear, it was typically not their design focus.&lt;ref name=rm&gt;Martin, Richard, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/amsp/hd_amsp.htm American Ingenuity: Sportswear 1930s-1970s] in Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History.

As more generic, versatile sportswear became more prominent in the Paris collections, the press increasingly promoted the wearing of such garments in an everyday context.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; By the mid-1920s, American advertisers also began actively pushing the idea that sporty clothing was just as appropriate for regular daywear as it was for active pursuits, presenting it as the epitome of modernity and the American ideal.&lt;ref name=arnoldorigin/&gt; One advertisement put out by [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] in ''Vogue'' in 1929 suggested that while men might admire a girl in an glamorous evening gown, they would be less intimidated by her approachable, friendly appearance in good-quality sportswear.&lt;ref name=arnoldorigin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Advertisement |title=Advertisement caption for Abercrombie and Fitch |journal=Vogue |date=16 March 1929 |page=15}} Cited by Arnold, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Sportswear was also presented as an accessible version of [[resort wear]], a term for the luxurious travelling clothing and holiday wear worn by those who could afford a leisurely lifestyle with multiple vacations, such as cruises, yachting, and [[skiing]].&lt;ref name=arnoldorigin/&gt; Affordable, well-designed all-American sportswear was presented as a way of enabling a less wealthy customer to feel part of that same lifestyle.&lt;ref name=arnoldorigin/&gt; However, at first, American apparel firms mostly copied French styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwd.com/globe-news/ready-to-wear-sportswear/sportswear-an-american-invention-6241103/|title=Sportswear: An American Invention|last=Lockwood|first=Lisa|date=2012-09-08|language=en-US |access-date=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUH0AwAAQBAJ|title=Fashion Design, Referenced: A Visual Guide to the History, Language, and Practice of Fashion|last=Kennedy|first=Alicia|last2=Stoehrer|first2=Emily Banis |last3=Calderin |first3=Jay |date=2013-02-01|publisher=Rockport Publishers|isbn=9781610582018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the acceptance of fashionable sportswear as a form of casual dressing in French fashion in the 1920s, the American garment industry went on to become the most prominent producers of such clothing.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; The key difference between French and American sportswear was that French sportswear was usually a small part of a high-end designer's output, while the American sportswear designers focused on affordable, versatile, easy-care garments that could be mass-produced and were relevant to the customer's lifestyle, enabling the modern, increasingly [[emancipation of women|emancipated woman]] to dress herself without a [[lady's maid|maid]]'s assistance.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt; Although the influence of Europe, particularly Parisian high fashion and English tailoring, was always significant, the [[Great Depression]] which started in 1929 acted as a trigger to encourage American fashion to focus on homegrown style and design - particularly sportswear.&lt;ref name=arnoldorigin/&gt; With 13 million Americans left unemployed by the Depression, it was necessary to create jobs and reduce the competition from imported goods in order to improve the American economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  At the same time, the growth of female athleticism and increased female employment fueled a need for simpler and less expensive clothing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J.|first=Robinson, Rebecca|date=2003-01-01|title=American Sportswear: A Study Of The Origins And Women Designers From The 1930’s To The 1960’s |url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/ap/10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:ucin1054926324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930–1945===
The precursors of true sportswear emerged in New York before the Second World War.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt; [[Clare Potter]] and [[Claire McCardell]] were among the first American designers in the 1930s to gain name recognition through their innovative clothing designs, which Martin described as demonstrating "problem-solving ingenuity and realistic lifestyle applications".&lt;ref name=rm/&gt; Garments were designed to be easy-to-wear and comfortable, using practical fabrics such as [[denim]], cotton, and [[jersey (fabric)|jersey]].&lt;ref name=vs&gt;{{cite book| last = Steele| first = Valerie| title = Fifty Years of Fashion: New Look To Now | publisher = Yale University Press, New Haven &amp; London| year = 1997| pages =27| ISBN = 0-300-07132-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCardell in particular has been described as America's greatest sportswear designer.&lt;ref name=vs/&gt; Her simple, practical clothes suited the relaxed American dress code, neither formal nor informal, that became established during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt; McCardell once proclaimed: "I belong to a mass production country where any of us, all of us, deserve the right to good fashion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Batterberry |first1=Michael |last2=Batterberry |first2=Ariane |title=Fashion, the mirror of history |date=1982 |publisher=Greenwich House |location=New York |isbn=9780517388815 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin credits the 1930s and 40s sportswear designers with freeing American fashion from the need to copy Paris couture. Where Paris fashion was traditionally imposed onto the customer regardless of her wishes, American sportswear was democratic, widely available, and encouraged self-expression.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt; The early sportswear designers proved that the creation of original ready-to-wear fashion could be a legitimate design art which responded stylishly to utilitarian requirements.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt;

Many of the first sportswear designers were women, including McCardell, Potter, [[Elizabeth Hawes]], [[Emily Wilkens]], [[Tina Leser]], and [[Vera Maxwell]]. A common argument was that female designers projected their personal values into this new style.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt; One of the few male designers at this time was [[Tom Brigance]], who by the late 1930s was regularly ranked alongside Potter as a leading name in mid-range priced sportswear.&lt;ref name=arnoldbrig&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnold |first1=Rebecca |title=The American look : fashion, sportswear, and the image of women in 1930s and 1940s New York |date=2008 |publisher=I.

In the 1930s and '40s, it was rare for clothing to be justified through its practicality. It was traditionally thought that Paris fashion exemplified beauty, and therefore, sportswear required different criteria for assessment.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt; The designer's personal life was therefore linked to their sportswear designs. Another selling point was sportswear's popularity with consumers, with [[department store]] representatives such as [[Dorothy Shaver]] of [[Lord &amp; Taylor]] using sales figures to back up their claims.&lt;ref name=rm/&gt; Maxwell and Potter were two of the first three sportswear designers, along with Helen Cookman, to be showcased and name-checked in Shaver's window displays and advertisements for Lord &amp; Taylor.&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt; Between 1932 and 1939, Shaver's "American Look" program at Lord &amp; Taylor promoted over sixty American designers including McCardell, Potter and [[Merry Hull]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://amhistory.si.edu/archives/WIB-tour/dorothy_shaver.pdf|title=Dorothy Shaver: The First Lady of Retailing |date=2002 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution|access-date=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaver advertised her American designers as if they were French couturiers,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and promoted their lower costs as a positive feature, rather than a sign of inferiority.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One of Shaver's retail experiments was a 'College Shop' section in the store, opened in the early 1930s and run by her assistant Helen Maddock, with the intent of offering casual but flattering clothing to young female college students. The stock, however, ended up selling swiftly to adult women as well as to the students.&lt;ref name=kirkland&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sally Kirkland |authorlink1=Sally Kirkland (editor)|editor1-last=Martin|editor1-first=Richard |editor1-link=Richard Martin (curator) |title=All-American: A Sportswear Tradition|publisher=Fashion Institute of Technology |pages=34–43 |language=en |chapter=Sportswear for Everywhere}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the key designs produced by this new generation of American designers were [[capsule wardrobe]]s such as McCardell's group of five wool jersey pieces from 1934, comprising two tops, long and short skirts, and a pair of culottes; and Maxwell's "weekend wardrobe" of five tweed and flannel garments. Both were designed to accommodate formal and informal occasions depending on how they were assembled and accessorised.&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt; McCardell also became well known for designs such as the Monastic and [[Popover dress]]es which were versatile enough to work in multiple contexts from swimsuit cover-ups to party dresses.&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claire McCardell: [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/C.I.45.71.2ab "Popover" dress (C.I.45.71.2ab)] |Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History" The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Rebecca Arnold and Emily S.

After the Second World War, the emergence in Paris of the luxurious "New Look" popularised by [[Christian Dior]], with its emphasis on accessorising and femininity, was in direct contrast to the relaxed, easy-wear [[American Look (fashion movement)|American look]].&lt;ref name=feal/&gt; [[Sally Kirkland (editor)|Sally Kirkland]], a fashion editor at ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]]'', noted that McCardell and others had already been thinking along the lines of longer and fuller skirts and fitted bodices, but that unlike Dior's heavily stiffened and corseted designs, they used [[bias cutting|bias-cut]] bodices and lightweight, easy-wear circle or pleated skirts to reproduce the same silhouette.&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt; Unlike traditional made-to-measure French couture fashion, designed for specific silhouettes, American sportswear was designed to accommodate a variety of body shapes and enable freedom of movement.&lt;ref name=feal/&gt; With the lifting of fabric rationing and restrictions following the War, American designers were able to use unlimited fabric and the development of permanent pleating meant that pleated dresses and full skirts were easy to look after.&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt; In addition to this, American stores had begun to recognise the commercial value of separates, with ''LIFE'' reporting in 1949 that separates made up an all-time-high of 30% of clothing sales in the States that Fall.&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s, designers continued to develop the theme of affordable, practical and innovative sportswear, producing clothing that focused on wearability rather than fashion fads, including [[Anne Fogarty]]'s coat-and-dress sets and dresses made with removable waistcoats to alter their look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Neill |first1=William L. |title=The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives: The 1960s |publisher=Cengage Gale |isbn=9780684806662 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9RSSmwEACAAJ&amp;dq|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Anne Fogarty: Day dress and coat (C.I.63.47.3ab)".

Along with many other designers, Gernreich took advantage of the development in the mid-1950s of upgraded machine-knitting techniques to produce his work.&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt; [[Double knitting]] (which was developed in Italy) enabled the mass-production of easy-to-wear knitted suits, coats and dresses that retained their shape and became a key American look in the 1960s and '70s.&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt;&lt;ref name=vs2/&gt; Another knitwear development involved varying the lines of the classic [[T-shirt]] so that it could be extended into dress-length versions, long or short sleeves, and other variations, including, by 1960, a sequined long evening version by [[Nine West Holdings|Kasper]] for Arnold &amp; Fox.&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt; In the 1960s, American sportswear depended on very simple shapes, often made in vivid colours and bold, geometric prints (such as those by Gernreich and [[Donald Brooks]]).&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt;

Towards the end of the 1960s, many sportswear designers such as [[Anne Klein]] and [[Halston]] began to enter business independently, rather than relying on the backing of their manufacturers, or working in association with firms and companies.&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt;

===1970–2000===
In a 1974 essay titled "Recession Dressing," the writer [[Kennedy Fraser]] noted how Halston's work, particularly his success with making basic garments in luxurious fabrics, was that of an "anti-designer" who liberated American women of fashion from needlessly elaborate, conventional high fashion from high-end establishment American designers. She also singled out [[Clovis Ruffin]] and [[Stephen Burrows (designer)|Stephen Burrows]].&lt;ref name=fraser&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fraser |first1=Kennedy |authorlink1=Kennedy Fraser |title=The fashionable mind: reflections on fashion, 1970-1981 |date=1981 |publisher=Knopf |chapter=Recession dressing (1974)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[Calvin Klein]], [[Jhane Barnes]], and [[Ralph Lauren]], Martin has described Halston, Ruffin and Burrows as "paragons" of 1970s and early 1980s Seventh Avenue sportswear style.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt;

During the 1970s, Lauren, Calvin Klein and [[Perry Ellis]] became particularly known for their sportswear designs, made in all-natural fibres such as wool, combed cotton, and linen, which placed them at the top tier of American fashion design alongside the Anne Klein label (designed by [[Donna Karan]] and Louis Dell'Olio).&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' in 1975 described Calvin Klein as having styled his clean, casual separates with the authority of a couture designer, and by 1985, Martin described him as "one of the great American stylists" with a solid international reputation and worldwide influence entirely based on his skills as a sportswear designer.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; The industry empires of Lauren and Calvin Klein would be joined in the mid-1980s by Donna Karan's own-name label and [[Tommy Hilfiger]], each of whom created distinctive wardrobes for the American woman based upon stylish but wearable, comfortable and interchangeable multi-purpose clothes that combined practicability with luxury.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt; These clothes were also designed to have a long, stylish and undated life, rather than to only be fashionable for one season.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; In 1976, the designer [[Zoran (designer)|Zoran]] brought out the first of a number of collections of extremely simple garments made of the finest quality fabrics; garments that barely changed over the years and which became cult objects to his wealthy clientele.&lt;ref name=menkes&gt;{{cite news |last1=Menkes |first1=Suzy |title=Simply Modern:Contrasting Looks at Luxury for the 1990s |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/28/style/28iht-zoran.html |accessdate=2 March 2015 |work=The New York Times |date=28 September 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the fashion journalist [[Suzy Menkes]] declared Zoran's less-is-more sportswear prophetic of the early 1990s modernist trend, whilst Zoran stated that the work of Calvin Klein, Karan, and the Anne Klein label epitomised the "comfort, simplicity, and practicality" associated with sportswear.&lt;ref name=menkes/&gt; Most early 21st century sportswear design follows in the footsteps of these designers.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt; Other notable sportswear designers of the late 20th century include [[Norma Kamali]], whose 1980s fashionable garments made from [[sweatshirt]] fabric were highly influential;&lt;ref name=martin/&gt;&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt;  [[Marc Jacobs]], whose eponymous label renowned for layered informality in both day and evening wear was founded in 1986, and [[Isaac Mizrahi]], who presented his first collection in 1987.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt;

Accessed 16 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Like Beene, he introduced menswear touches to his sportswear, which was described as clean, modern and impeccable in style.&lt;ref name=nemy/&gt; Kirkland commented in 1985 that sportswear designers such as [[Liz Claiborne]] and Joan Vass were no longer "borrowing from the boys," but had begun making menswear too.&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt; In addition to the high-end names who produced apparel in large quantity, a more personal level of sportswear was offered in the early 1980s by smaller designers such as [[Mary Jane Marcasiano]] and Vass, who specialised in hand-knits in wool and cotton.&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt; By the mid-1980s, sportswear had become a key part of the international fashion scene, forming a large part of America's contribution to the twice-yearly fashion presentations alongside top-end collections from Paris, Milan and London.&lt;ref name=kirkland/&gt;

===21st century sportswear===
[[File:Michael Kors Spring-Summer 2014 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Relaxed easy-wear sportswear by [[Michael Kors]], Spring-Summer 2014.]]
In 2000, the ''Lifestyle Monitor'', an American [[trade magazine]] owned by [[Cotton Incorporated]] published that their surveys showed that an average of 64% of women interviewed preferred casual wear, including sportswear as distinct from [[sportswear (activewear)|active wear]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifestylemonitor.cottoninc.com/lsm-weekly/lsm-weekly-articles/?articleID=209&amp;prevArticle=387&amp;nextArticle=389 The Monitor Celebrates Sixty Years of Sportswear], Lifestyle Monitor, 23 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable New York sportswear designers of the first decade of the 21st century included [[Zac Posen]], [[Proenza Schouler]], [[Mary Ping]], [[Derek Lam]], and [[Behnaz Sarafpour]], who were all featured in the Sportswear section of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]'s ''New York Fashion Now'' exhibition in 2007.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt;

Designers who do not typically work in the sportswear tradition such as [[Monique Lhuillier]] sometimes incorporate elements of sportswear and activewear into their work. Lhuillier, mainly known for formal gowns, introduced sporty necklines and aerodynamic elements into her collection for [[New York Fashion Week]], Fall 2011.&lt;ref name=boston&gt;Critchell, Samantha. [http://articles.boston.com/2011-09-12/lifestyle/30145956_1_previews-derek-lam-donna-karan/3 "Fashion world marks Sept. 11 as shows go on"], ''The Boston Globe'', September 12, 2011. Accessed 16 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 [[Tim Gunn]] noted that the boundaries between activewear and fashion sportswear had become increasingly blurred since the 1980s, with many people choosing to wear [[hoodie]]s, [[tracksuit]]s, [[yoga pants]], and other garments explicitly associated with athletic wear as everyday dress.&lt;ref name=gunn&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gunn |first1=Tim |last2=Calhoun |first2=Ada |title=Tim Gunn's fashion bible : the fascinating history of everything in your closet |date=2012 |publisher=Gallery Books|location=New York |isbn=9781451643862 |pages=205–212 |edition=1st Gallery Books hardcover|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWG9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205 |chapter=Athletic Wear: Attack of the Playclothes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside the United States==

===Italy===
In the late 1940s and 1950s non-American designers began to pay attention to sportswear, and attempted to produce collections following its principle. French couturiers including [[Christian Dior SA|Dior]] and [[Jacques Fath|Fath]] simplified their designs for ready-to-wear production, but at first only the Italian designers understood the sportswear principle.&lt;ref name=dc&gt;da Cruz, Elyssa. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/itfa/hd_itfa.htm "Made in Italy: Italian Fashion from 1950 to Now"]. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. (October 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Italy already had a reputation for fine fabrics and excellent workmanship, and the emergence of high quality Italian ready-to-wear that combined this luxury with the casual quality of American sportswear ensured the worldwide success of Italian fashion by the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name=vs2/&gt; Italian designers, including [[Emilio Pucci]] and [[Simonetta Visconti]], grasped that there was a market for clothing that combined sophistication and comfort.&lt;ref name=dc/&gt; This was a challenge to the American industry. [[John Fairchild (editor)|John Fairchild]], the outspoken publisher of ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' opined that [[Krizia]], [[Missoni]], and other Italian designers were "the first to make refined sportswear."&lt;ref name=vs2&gt;{{cite book| last = Steele| first = Valerie| title = Fifty Years of Fashion: New Look To Now | publisher = Yale University Press, New Haven &amp; London| year = 1997| pages =104–105| ISBN = 0-300-07132-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before co-founding the business that later became Missoni with his bride Rosita in 1953, [[Ottavio Missoni]], himself an athlete, and his teammate [[Giorgio Oberweger]] had an activewear business in [[Trieste]] making wool [[tracksuit]]s christened Venjulia suits.&lt;ref name=sportsref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottavio Missoni Bio, Stats and Results|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mi/ottavio-missoni-1.html|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the Venjulia suits, which took into account the need of athletes for functional, warm garments enabling freedom of movement, led to their being worn by the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Italian Olympics team]] (which included Missoni himself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Missonologia : the world of Missoni |year=1995 |publisher=Electa |location=Milan |isbn=0789200481 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=cyaOUYiOCKbI0QX7vYHQDA&amp;id=bm1OAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Venjulia|edition=1st U.S.|author=Steve Piccolo (translator)|editor=Isa Tutino Vercelloni}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s Missoni became renowned for their uniquely colored, mix-and-match knitwear separates based upon activewear,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Sandy|title=Fashioning fabrics: contemporary textiles in fashion|year=2006|publisher=Black Dog|location=London|page=176|isbn=1904772412}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have remained desirable and fashionable well into the 21st century.&lt;ref name=indobit&gt;{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Linda|title=Ottavio Missoni: Fashion designer who transformed the world of luxury knitwear|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ottavio-missoni-fashion-designer-who-transformed-the-world-of-luxury-knitwear-8611726.html|accessdate=11 May 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of Italian sportswear was recognized early on by Robert Goldworm, an American sportswear designer who in 1947 joined his New York-based family company [[Goldworm]].&lt;ref name=barbara&gt;{{cite book |last=Perso Heinemann |first=Barbara |title=Fashioning an Artful Life: One Woman's Life History in Clothes |date=2008 |publisher=University of Minnesota |isbn=9780549405054 |pages=107–108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oSqL94evfOsC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his second company base in Milan, Goldworm became the first American knitwear designer to take advantage of Italian quality and bring it to the New York market.&lt;ref name=barbara/&gt; In 1959 Goldworm, in recognition of his active promotion and support of the Italian knitwear industry, was made a Commander of the [[Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity]] by the Italian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Eleanor|title=World of fashion : people, places, resources|date=1976|publisher=R.R.

He was awarded the Star of Solidarity and the title of commander by the Italian government.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, Italian fashion remains a leading source for sportswear design outside the United States. [[Narciso Rodriguez]], who is known for streamlined and pared down clothing, launched in [[Milan]] in 1997, but moved to New York in 2001.&lt;ref name=nyf/&gt; [[Miuccia Prada]] revived the fortunes of her family company [[Prada]] with her top-quality sportswear designs in the 1990s, and continues designing for the firm.&lt;ref name=dc/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Successful British sportswear designers include [[Stella McCartney]], known for her jumpsuits and easy-to-wear separates. McCartney was asked to design the athletic uniforms for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], bringing fashionable sportswear design to the world of high-profile activewear.&lt;ref&gt;Chetty, Derick.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9441">A '''statistext''' is a [[demography|demographic]] category that is artificially contrived in pursuit of a political or ideological goal, particularly when categories are created that respondents would not otherwise apply to themselves.&lt;ref name='Kobayashi'&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kobayashi |first=Audrey |author= |authorlink= |editor= |encyclopedia=Challenges of Measuring an Ethnic World: Science, Politics, and Reality |title=Representing Ethnicity: Political Statistexts |url= |accessdate= |edition= |year=1993 |publisher=Statistics Canada and U.S. Bureau of the Census, U.S. Government Printing Office |volume= |location=Washington, DC |id= |doi= |pages=513–525 |isbn= 0-16-042049-0}} This 1993 publication is based on a conference held in 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was created by Audrey Kobayashi, a Canadian geographer, in 1992.&lt;ref name='Kobayashi'/&gt;

==Canada==

===Legal definitions===
According to the Employment Equity Act of 1995, the definition of visible minority is:
{{quotation|
"members of visible minorities" means persons, other than aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour;&lt;ref&gt;Employment Equity Act (1995, c. 44) [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/E-5.401/page-2.html#anchorbo-ga:s_3 Act current to Oct 20th, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
This definition can be traced back to the 1984 Report of the [[Rosalie Abella|Abella]] Commission on Equality in Employment,. The Commission described the term visible minority as an "ambiguous categorization", but for practical purposes interpreted it to mean "visibly non-white".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolley|first=Frances|title=Visible Minorities: Distinctly Canadian|url=http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2013/05/visible-minorities-distinctly-canadian.html|publisher=Worthwhile Canadian Initiative|accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Canadian government uses an [[operational definition]] where they classify as visible minorities the following groups:  ''Blacks, Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, Koreans, Latin Americans, Pacific Islanders, South Asians, and West Asians/Arabs.''&lt;ref&gt;Visible Minority Population and Population Group Reference Guide, 2006 Census [http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/ref/rp-guides/visible_minority-minorites_visibles-eng.cfm#Classifications Statcan]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a few exceptions are applied to some groups, according to the explanation given by the ''Visible Minority Population and Population Group Reference Guide'' of the 2006 Census, the exception is:
{{quotation|
"In contrast, in accordance with employment equity definitions, persons who reported 'Latin American' and 'White,' 'Arab' and 'White,' or 'West Asian' and 'White' have been excluded from the visible minority population. Likewise, persons who reported 'Latin American,' 'Arab' or 'West Asian' and who provided a European write-in response such as 'French' have been excluded from the visible minority population as well. These persons are included in the 'Not a visible minority' category. However, persons who reported 'Latin American,' 'Arab' or 'West Asian' and a non-European write-in response are included in the visible minority population."&lt;ref&gt;Visible Minority Population and Population Group Reference Guide, 2006 Census - Catalogue no. 97-562-GWE2006003 [http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/ref/rp-guides/visible_minority-minorites_visibles-eng.cfm#Classifications Statcan]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The use of the term "non-white" controversially refers to those who are not considered by the Canadian government to be Caucasian, and does open the door to ambiguity. For example, people who are Lebanese, Berber, Latin American or South Asian may consider themselves to be white, yet the federal government forcibly imposes upon Arabs and Latin Americans  the status of being visible minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Mentzer, M. S. |date=January 2002 |title=The Canadian experience with employment equity legislation |journal=International Journal of Value-Based Management |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=35–50 |doi=10.1023/A:1013021402597 |issn=0895-8815 |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of use===
Examples of statistexts used by the Canadian government include the forced categorization of non-Europeans as  "[[Visible minority|visible minorities]]", particularly [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] from [[Western Asia]], [[South Asia]], and [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name='Bauder'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Visible minorities and urban analysis |journal=Canadian Journal of Urban Research |year=2001 |first=Harald |last=Bauder |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=69–90 |issn=1188-3774 |id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another example of a statistext is the category "Canadian" as an ethnic choice on Canadian census forms.&lt;ref name='Bauder'/&gt; One demographer has speculated that as an ethnic identity, respondents might choose this to voice patriotism, or to rebel against ethnic classification, or to voice an [[Quebec sovereignty movement|anti-separatist]] opinion, and furthermore, that the term has very different connotations in English versus French. (See footnote 5 in.&lt;ref name='Bauder'/&gt;) An earlier version with a slightly different title is available at [http://mbc.metropolis.net/assets/uploads/files/wp/2001/WP01-09.pdf]. These terms do not match the nomenclature such individuals would ordinarily apply to themselves, although sometimes statistexts gain acceptance among the people to whom the term is applied.

The nomenclature of minority groups has a number of effects. Statistexts can empower some ethnic or linguistic minorities in some instances, while marginalizing and prejudicing them in others. Some may be demoralized by the nomenclature applied to them, as when a Canadian feels the government-imposed "visible minority" label highlights one’s "outsider" or "exotic" background.&lt;ref name='Bauder'/&gt; In other instances, nomenclature applied to a minority group may enable them to present a united front for political mobilization.

As well, these contrived categories lump together distinct groups that would not otherwise perceive each other as members of the same group.

===Statistexts as state-sanctioned racism===
The classification "visible minorities" has attracted controversy. In March 2007, the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] described the term as racist because it singles out a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UN calls Canada racist for 'visible minorities' tag | publisher=Canada.com | date=8 March 2007 | url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=f469b36e-c587-40e7-98e5-3aa50a371318&amp;k=23802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism arises regarding the composition of "visible minorities" as defined by the Canadian government. Critics have noted that the groups comprising "visible minorities" have little in common with each other, as they include some disadvantaged ethnic groups and other groups who are not disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Not all visible minorities face labour market discrimination|journal=Policy Options/Options Politiques| date= 2000|first=Derek|last=Hum|author2=Wayne Simpson | volume=21| issue=10| pages=45–48| issn= 0226-5893 |id= | url=|format=|postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of visible minority has been cited in demography research as an example of a statistext, meaning a census category that has been contrived for a particular public policy purpose.&lt;ref name='Kobayashi'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Bauder'/&gt;

Since 2008, census data and media reports have suggested that the "visible minorities" label no longer makes sense in some large Canadian cities due to immigration trends in recent decades.  For example, "visible minorities" actually comprise the ''majority'' of the population in [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[Burnaby]], [[Greater Vancouver Electoral Area A, British Columbia|Greater Vancouver A]], and [[Brampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Visible minorities the new majority| author=Hamilton, Graeme| work=National Post| date=2008-04-03| url = http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=417736|accessdate =2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the term "visible minority"  is used for the administration of the Employment Equity Act, and refers to its statistical reality in Canada as a whole and not any particular region.

==United States==
In the United States, examples would be [[Hispanic-Latino naming dispute|Hispanic and Latino Americans]], [[Pacific Islander American]] and [[Asian American]]. The word "Indian", allegedly created by [[Christopher Columbus]] for the [[Indigenous people of the Americas]], is another example of a statistext.&lt;ref name='Kobayashi'/&gt; While Columbus's use of this term initially had nothing to do with censuses, this contrivance did enable him to classify people in a way that coincided with the goal of finding a trade route to India.

The '''technology in ''[[Star Trek]]''''' has borrowed freely from the scientific world to provide storylines. Episodes are replete with references to [[tachyon]] beams, [[baryon]] sweeps, [[quantum]] fluctuations and [[event horizon]]s. Many of the technologies created for the ''Star Trek'' universe were done so out of simple financial necessity&amp;mdash;the [[transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] was created because the limited budget of the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original series]] in the 1960s did not allow expensive shots of [[Lists of Star Trek spacecraft|spaceship]]s landing on [[Lists of Star Trek planets|planet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation 365 by Paula M. Block, Terry J. Erdmann&lt;/ref&gt;{{page number|date=January 2018}}

''[[Discovery Channel]] Magazine'' stated that [[cloaking device]]s, [[faster-than-light]] travel and [[transporter (Star Trek)|dematerialized transport]] were only dreams at the time the original series was made, but physicist [[Michio Kaku]] believes all these things are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Gary|last=Sledge|title=Going Where No One Has Gone Before|journal=Discovery Channel Magazine|issue=3|issn=1793-5725|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shatner]], who portrayed [[James T. Kirk]] in the original ''Star Trek'' series, believed this as well, and went on to cowrite the book ''I'm Working on That'', in which he investigated how ''Star Trek'' technology was becoming feasible.

==Subspace==
[[File:Star Trek Warp Field.png|250px|thumb|right|A visualization of a warp field&amp;mdash;the ship rests in a bubble of normal space.]]
In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' fictional universe, '''subspace''' is a feature of [[Spacetime|space-time]] that facilitates [[faster-than-light]] transit, in the form of interstellar travel or the transmission of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = StarTrek.com Official StarTrek Website, Subspace Radio Article | url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/library/technology/article/70261.html | accessdate = 2007-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subspace works similarly to the [[Alcubierre Drive]], but obeys different laws of physics. Subspace has also been adopted and used in other fictional settings, such as the ''[[Stargate]]'' franchise, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series, and ''[[Descent: Freespace]]''.

In most ''Star Trek'' series, subspace communications are a means to establish nearly instantaneous contact with people and places that are light years away. The physics of ''Star Trek'' describe infinite speed (expressed as [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|Warp 10]]) as an impossibility; as such, even subspace communications which putatively travel at speeds over Warp 9.9 may take hours or weeks to reach certain destinations. Since subspace signals do not degrade with the square of the distance as do other methods of communication utilizing conventional bands of the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e. radio waves), signals sent from a great distance can be expected to reach their destination at a predictable time and with little relative degradation (barring any random subspace interference or spatial anomalies).

Subspace communications have a limit of just over 20 light years before they must be boosted, although this limitation has been "written around" in several storylines.

'''''Ten Years of Marriage''''' (结婚十年) is a 1943 Chinese novel written by [[Su Qing]] 苏青 (1914–1982).
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.renditions.org/renditions/authors/suq.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Owing to her authentic descriptions of sexual psychology, Su Qing was described as a bold female writer and her work received mixed praise.

''Ten Years of Marriage'' is a semi-autobiographical work which tells the story of a Chinese woman's life after marriage. It depicts her feelings as a new bride, the bitterness and happiness of delivery, her extramarital love and her associations with different kinds of men.

The protagonist, Su Huaiqin is a woman born into a fatherless household. She was considered a [[Mandarin Chinese profanity|xiaojie]] (someone of poor standing), before she married Xu Chongxian. Her new husband is from a big feudal family. He is called [[Shaoye]] (young master), by the family servants. The novel begins with an official notice of their marriage in a newspaper.

==Characters==

*Su Huaiqin: the wife and the main character.

===''The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour'' (2004)===
Struggling with his science project, Timmy Turner wishes that he could be sent to the best laboratory in any universe. When his fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, fulfill this wish, Timmy is sent to Retroville, the [[fictional universe]] of child prodigy Jimmy Neutron, who's sent to Dimmsdale in Timmy's universe when he activates a magical transporter created by Cosmo and Wanda. As they attempt to return to their respective settings, the characters interact with the various side characters of each other's universe and Timmy becomes romantically involved with Jimmy's classmate, Cindy Vortex. But Timmy's meddling with Goddard, Jimmy's robotic dog, and the seizure of the magical transporter from Jimmy by Mr. Crocker, Timmy's insane teacher, both threaten each character's world in turn.&lt;ref name="AMAZON1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Fairly-Parents-Adventures-Neutron/dp/B0001JXQ3I|title='The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour' ('The Fairly Odd Parents' / 'The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron')|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour When Nerds Collide'' (2006)===
Timmy and Jimmy enter each other's worlds for a second time, both wanting to ask Cindy out to their school dance celebrating [[Friday the 13th]]. In an attempt to gain Cindy's affections, the two engage in a battle of smarts that sends Jimmy and his friends to Dimmsdale. As Jimmy seeks to prove that Timmy is a fraudulent scientist, Cosmo and Wanda struggle to keep their existence a secret from the people of Retroville. Meanwhile, Professor Calamitous, who is of Jimmy's universe, unleashes a surge of anti-fairies from Fairy World that threatens the rotation of Timmy's Earth. Head fairy Jorgen Von Strangle of Timmy's universe gets angered by Jimmy's and Timmy's friends and their manipulation of fairy magic.&lt;ref name="AMAZON2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Jimmy-Timmy-Power-Hour/dp/B000CNESL2/|title='The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 2: When Nerds Collide' ('The Fairly Odd Parents' / 'The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron')|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators'' (2006)===
In their third and final encounter, Timmy and Jimmy make amends while trying to defeat the enemies from their own universes—including a monster that they concoct together—while accidentally rejecting their respective friends in the process, including Cindy. Initially, they are unable to make the monster evil enough to fight them properly, but when they succeed, he absorbs Cosmo and Wanda's magic and Jimmy's intelligence, and begins destroying both children's universes.&lt;ref name="TVGUIDE"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/jimmy-timmy-power-hour-3-the-jerkinators/509970/|title='Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators!'|work=TV Guide|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Each film in the ''Jimmy Timmy Power Hour'' series combines the 2D traditional animation of the ''Fairly OddParents'' and the [[3D computer graphics|3D computer-generated imagery]] of ''The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius''. This blending of animation techniques was a technical challenge for the studios responsible for both series, according to Keith Alcorn—director of the ''Jimmy Neutron'' production company [[DNA Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Ryan|date=May 7, 2004|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/jimmytimmy-power-hour-director-talks-blending-2d-and-3d/|title=Jimmy/Timmy Power Hour Director Talks Blending 2D and 3D|work=Animation Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Titus Flavius T. f. T. n. Clemens''' was a nephew of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Vespasian]]. He was the son of [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul AD 69)|Titus Flavius Sabinus]], [[Roman consul|consul]] ''suffectus'' in AD 69, and a brother of [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul AD 82)|Titus Flavius Sabinus]], consul in AD 82.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Townend, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/298836 "Some Flavian Connections"], ''[[Journal of Roman Studies]]'', 51 (1961), pp. 55-57&lt;/ref&gt; The emperors [[Titus]] and [[Domitian]] were his cousins.

As a child, Clemens was besieged along with his family in the capitol, when the soldiers of his uncle, Vespasian, were approaching Rome. His father was captured and slain by the forces of [[Vitellius]], who burnt the capitol, but the rest of the family escaped.

Clemens' brother was consul with Domitian, shortly after the latter's accession, but the emperor put his cousin to death on the pretext that the herald proclaiming him consul had called him ''Imperator''. In fact, the emperor was more likely motivated by his love for his cousin's wife, [[Julia Flavia]] (who, as the daughter of his brother Titus, was also his niece).&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius|Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus]], ''[[The Twelve Caesars|De Vita Caesarum]]'', ''Domitianus'' 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clemens also married one of his cousins, [[Flavia Domitilla (saint)|Flavia Domitilla]], daughter of Vespasian's daughter, [[Domitilla the Younger|Domitilla]], who was thus also a niece of Domitian. They had two sons, whom Domitian intended to succeed him in the empire, renaming one of them ''Vespasian'' and the other ''Domitian''. However, in AD 95, when Clemens and the emperor were consuls, Domitian had his cousin put to death.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Domitianus'' 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Cassius Dio]], Clemens was put to death on a charge of atheism, for which, he adds, many others who went over to the Jewish opinions were executed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio|Lucius Cassius Dio Cocceianus]], ''Roman History'' lxvii. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  This may imply that Clemens had converted to Judaism or Christianity, the former being more likely, and accompanied by circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4391-circumcision&lt;/ref&gt;  For the same reason, his wife was banished to [[Ventotene|Pandataria]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]], ''Life of Apollonius of Tyana'' viii. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' iii. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome|Eusebius Sophronius Hieronymus]], ''Epistulae'' 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

To this Clemens in all probability is dedicated the [[Basilica of San Clemente al Laterano]], on the [[Caelian hill]], which is believed to have been built originally in the fifth century, although its site is now occupied by a more recent, though very ancient, structure. In the year 1725 Cardinal [[Annibal Albani]] found under this church an inscription in honour of Flavius Clemens, martyr, which is described in a work called ''T. Flavii Clementis Viri Consularis et Martyris Tumulus illustratis''.&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal Annibal Albani, ''T. Flavii Clementis Viri Consularis et Martyris Tumulus illustratis'' (Urbino, 1727)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some connect Clemens with [[Pope Clement I|Clemens Romanus]], perhaps the author of the [[First Epistle of Clement|Epistle to the Corinthians]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], Editor.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story''''' is a 1994 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[Biography|biographical]] [[Satire|satirical]]-[[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written by Phil Penningroth and directed by [[Larry Shaw (director)|Larry Shaw]]. It stars [[Alexandra Powers]] as [[Tonya Harding]] and [[Heather Langenkamp]] as [[Nancy Kerrigan]] and focuses on the [[Tonya Harding#Attack on Nancy Kerrigan and aftermath|January 1994 attack]] on Kerrigan and the extensive media coverage surrounding the infamous incident. It was released on [[NBC]] in April 1994, based on [[public domain]] material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-08-26/features/9408260191_1_nancy-kerrigan-movie-night-tv-audience|title=Remember Nancy And Tonya?|first=Jessica|last=Seigel |newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=August 26, 1994|accessdate=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film portrays [[Figure Skating|figure skaters]] [[Tonya Harding]] and [[Nancy Kerrigan]], and the extensive media coverage following the infamous [[Tonya Harding#Attack on Nancy Kerrigan and aftermath|1994 attack]] on Kerrigan. It features a [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] breaking of the [[fourth wall]] by having [[Dennis Boutsikaris]] play its screenwriter, addressing the audience over the course of the story. It also features, as labelled by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', various "witnesses" of [[Greek chorus]] [[actors]], discussing their perspectives of different issues and themes as they emerge in the story. One of the last lines in it is "We imprisoned [Tonya and Nancy] in images we use to sell newspapers, soup, and TV movies. They're victims of those that the media serve".&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

==Production==
When asked about her role as Tonya, Alexandra Powers stated "In a lot of ways, it's the role of the year. Nothing like this ever happened in figure skating. Tonya and Nancy were all over the media, day in and day out. To me, Tonya has the best poker face I've ever seen. With all the controversy going down, she had a smile on her face. She still went to the Olympics. That makes an actor interested. She's either really innocent or deep in denial or she's insane."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-04-15/news/9404150479_1_alexandra-powers-tonya-and-nancy-skater-tonya-harding|title=Alexandra Powers Of 'L.A. Law' Laces Up An Attitude For Tonya Role|agency=Philadelphia Inquirer|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=April 15, 1994|accessdate=August 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film premiered on [[NBC]] on April 30, 1994, with a rating of 10.4 and share of 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvtango.com/movie/tonya_and_nancy_the_inside_story|title=Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story|last=|first=|date=|website=TV Tango|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Ray Loynd of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that ''Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story'' "intelligently captures the chaos of the source material. The story may reek of moral squalor and may already be played out in the print and electronic media, but the moviemakers almost make it look fresh." He enjoyed how the "''[[Rashomon]]''-style multiple viewpoints and array of talking witnesses, presented à la the movie ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'', continually propel the narrative", giving it a [[Satire|satirical]] tone. Loynd liked how Alexandra Powers portrayed Harding as stranded between [[figure skating]]'s culture of gentility and her rural heritage. He thought that the film did convey the pressures of competitive sports and the relentless demand to win. Loynd also admired the [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] perspective of a scene with television network executives debating how to tell this very story.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1994/tv/reviews/tonya-nancy-the-inside-story-1200436535/|title=Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story|last=Loynd|first=Ray|date=April 29, 1994|website=Variety|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Williams of [[The Associated Press]] praised how writer Phil Penningroth [[Frame story|framed the narrative]] cleverly, beginning with a [[close-up]] of [[Dennis Boutsikaris]], as the film's screenwriter, musing "Sometimes, I think this could be a [[Anti-fairy tale|fairy tale]]...one of those strange dark tales, where monsters eat little children." He liked that ''Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story'' was "interpretive", and thought it was generally well crafted, acted, and sometimes poignant. Williams wrote that Alexandra Powers successfully portrayed Harding's insecurities and vulnerability, and that director [[Larry Shaw (director)|Larry Shaw]] kept the story engaging. He also wrote that, although the film could have been "a hasty 'ripped from the headlines' movie-of-the-week with cartoon characters...overacting stale emotions and restating public record", ''Tonya &amp; Nancy'' emerged as less of an "evidence photo" and more of a character study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/32f312e2053ef3efcb7abd01bc4feb0d| title=NBC's 'Tonya and Nancy: The Inside Story' Transcends Its Genre|first=Scott|last=Williams|agency=The Associated Press|date=April 29, 1994|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John J. O'Connor (journalist)|John J. O'Connor]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the story held few surprises, yet he too admired Phil Penningroth's method of [[Frame story|structuring the narrative]]. O'Connor liked the [[Dennis Boutsikaris]] character alluding to [[Anti-fairy tale|fairy tale]]s while addressing the audience about Tonya and Nancy: "Once upon a time there were two little girls..." He praised how various perspectives were offered regarding the [[caricature]]s of "Nancy the Good" and "Tonya the Bad". O'Connor also enjoyed the [[metafiction]]al scene of television network executives discussing how to produce ''Tonya &amp; Nancy'': "an ingenious ploy to undercut any suggestion of NBC cupidity". He liked that the film commented about how the [[Olympism|Olympic ideal]] has evolved and thought that [[James Wilder (actor)|James Wilder]] portrayed Jeff Gillooly as a compelling character. O'Connor believed that ''Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story'' generally avoided the artifice of other [[docudrama]]s that "have a nasty habit of distorting facts." He also believed Harding was portrayed with fitting sympathy, as the film chronicled her undoing. The last line in the film was the screenwriter feeling sorry for her: "Some fairy tales don't have a happy ending".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/29/arts/tv-weekend-how-a-confederate-widow-became-the-oldest.html|title=TV Weekend; 'Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story', NBC|last=O'Connor|first=John J.|date=April 29, 1994|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Jicha of the ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'' also praised the film's narrative, but did not believe it offered an "inside story" with "significant information". He liked that two versions of Jeff Gillooly approaching the conspiracy meeting are presented, and that "it is up to the viewer to sort out what to believe". Jicha wrote that ''Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story'' was "more Tonya's story than Nancy's", and noted that Harding's mother was portrayed as a greater "domineering" influence over Harding than Gillooly. He also liked that Nancy Kerrigan was represented compassionately with some dimension as she struggles with self-doubt. Jicha was also impressed that "NBC doesn't spare itself" in the [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] network executives scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-04-30/lifestyle/9404280609_1_tonya-and-nancy-tonya-harding-nancy-kerrigan|title=Insight's Out - In Tonya Tale - Film Is Slick Narrative But No New Details Emerge|last=Jicha|first=Tom|date=April 30, 1994|newspaper=Sun-Sentinel|access-date=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Shales]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' did not believe the film transcended the "tedious account of that big news story all America is sick to death of". Shales wrote that screenwriter Phil Penningroth did explore themes of celebrity, notoriety, and [[media ethics]] – but did so inadequately. He wrote that one of the weaknesses of the film was that none of the characters had a chance to be credible personalities. Shales thought that portions of the film bordered on [[cliché]], although he did concede to some effective comedic moments. He praised the performances of Powers and Langenkamp, stating "Alexandra Powers and Heather Langenkamp do look like Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan and do passable impressions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/olympics1998/history/timeline/articles/time_043094.htm |title='Tonya and Nancy: The Inside Story'|last=Shales|first=Tom|date=April 30, 1994|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-04-30/features/1994120064_1_inside-story-tonya-and-nancy-tonya-harding|title='Most Wanted' looks for 300th fugitive|last=Bianculli|first=David|date=April 30, 1994|website=The Baltimore Sun|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; praised Langenkamp's portrayal of Kerrigan but was more negative towards Powers' performance stating "Ms. Langenkamp wastes a decent performance here, but Alexandra Powers of ''[[L.A. Law]]'' is woefully miscast as Tonya Harding."

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-30/entertainment/ca-52145_1_thin-ice|title=NBC's 'Tonya and Nancy' on Very Thin Ice : TV Review: The network criticizes itself in the movie, but that doesn't make it any better.|last=Rosenburg|first=Howard|date=April 30, 1994|website=Los Angeles Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave the film a negative review stating:
:"By sharply criticizing itself for existing, ''Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story'' is television's first movie in years to have its own out-of-body experience. Unfortunately, that in no way enhances the experience of watching it."
:"Ridiculing Gillooly, Shawn Eckardt ([[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]]) and their fellow conspirators as clowns, Penningroth and director Larry Shaw try for some of the [[Black comedy|dark comedy]] deployed in [[HBO]]'s Emmy-winning docu-parody ''[[The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom]]''. Instead, [this film] turns out to be just another dull movie about dull people. After squandering two hours on it, you may be asking: "Why me? Why anyone?"

'''Vortigern''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɔːr|t|ᵻ|dʒ|ɜːr|n}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1892 |title=Vortigern |encyclopedia=Spiers and Surenne's English and French Pronouncing Dictionary |publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Co |location=New York |last=Spiers |first=A |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHw5AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=vortigern#v=snippet&amp;q=vortigern&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Welsh]] ''Guorthigirn'', ''Guorthegern''; {{lang-cy|Gwrtheyrn}}; {{lang-ang|Wyrtgeorn}}; [[Old Breton]] ''Gurdiern'', ''Gurthiern''; {{lang-gle|Foirtchern}}; {{lang-la|Vortigernus, Vertigernus, Uuertigernus, etc}}), also spelled '''Vortiger''', '''Vortigan''', and '''Vortigen''', was possibly a 5th-century warlord in [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain]], known perhaps as a [[king of the Britons]], at least connoted as such in the writings of [[Bede]]. His existence is nonetheless contested by scholars, and information about him is obscure.

He may have been the "superbus tyrannus" said to have invited [[Hengist and Horsa]] to aid him in fighting the [[Picts]] and the [[Scottish people|Scots]]. However, they revolted, killing his son in the process and forming the [[Kingdom of Kent]]. It is said that he took refuge in [[North Wales]], and that his grave was in [[Dyfed]] or the [[Llŷn Peninsula]]. The historian [[Gildas]] denigrated Vortigern for his misjudgement and also blamed him for the loss of Britain. He is cited at the beginning of the genealogy of the early [[Kingdom of Powys|Kings of Powys]]

==Accounts==

===Gildas===
The 6th-century cleric and historian [[Gildas]] wrote ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'' ({{lang-en|On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain}}) in the first decades of the 6th century. In Chapter 23, he tells how "all the councillors, together with ''that proud usurper''" [''omnes consiliarii una cum superbo tyranno''] made the mistake of inviting "the fierce and impious [[Saxons]]" to [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|settle in Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Gildas, ''De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae'', chapter XXIII, text and translation of the quoted passage in {{cite web |url=http://www.vortigernstudies.org.uk/artsou/gildvort.htm |title=Gildas and Vortigern |first= Robert |last=Vermaat |work=Vortigern Studies |accessdate=2010-01-28 |publisher=Vortigernstudies.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gildas, apparently, a small group came at first and was settled "on the eastern side of the island, by the invitation of the unlucky [''infaustus''] usurper". This small group invited more of their countrymen to join them, and the colony grew. Eventually the Saxons demanded that "their monthly allotments" be increased and, when their demands were eventually refused, broke their treaty and plundered the lands of the [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]].

It is not clear whether Gildas used the name Vortigern. Most editions published presently omit the name. Two manuscripts name him: ''MS. A'' (Avranches [[Manuscript|MS]] 162, 12th century), refers to ''Uortigerno''; and ''Mommsen's MS. X'' (Cambridge University Library MS. Ff. I.27) (13th century) calls him ''Gurthigerno''.&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;{{Cite book |last=Snyder |first=Christopher A. |author-link=Christopher Snyder|year=1998 |title=An Age of Tyrants: Britain and the Britons A.D. 400–600 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |publication-date=1998 |publication-place=University Park |page=305 |isbn=0-271-01780-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AFxFkwmnRJMC&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;vq=Gurthigerno&amp;pg=PA305#v=snippet&amp;q=Gurthigerno }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gildas never addresses Vortigern as the king of Britain. He is termed a [[usurper]] (''tyrannus''), but not solely responsible for inviting the Saxons. To the contrary, he is portrayed as being aided by or aiding a "Council", which may be a government based on the representatives of all the "cities" (''civitates'') or a part thereof. Gildas also does not consider Vortigern as bad; he just qualifies him as "unlucky" (''infaustus'') and lacking judgement, which is understandable, as these mercenaries proved to be faithless.

Gildas adds several small details that suggest either he or his source received at least part of the story from the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. The first is when he describes the size of the initial party of Saxons, he states that they came in three ''cyulis'' (or "keels"), "as they call ships of war". This may be the earliest recovered word of English. The second detail is that he repeats that the visiting Saxons were "foretold by a certain soothsayer among them, that they should occupy the country to which they were sailing three hundred years, and half of that time, a hundred and fifty years, should plunder and despoil the same."&lt;ref name=snyder/&gt; Both of these details are unlikely to have been invented by a Roman or [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic]] source.

Modern scholars have debated the various details of Gildas' story. One topic of discussion has been about the words Gildas uses to describe the Saxons' subsidies (''annonas'', ''epimenia'') and whether they are legal terms used in a treaty of ''[[foederati]]'', a late [[Roman Empire|Roman]] political practice of settling allied barbarian peoples within the boundaries of the empire to furnish troops to aid the defence of the empire. It is not known whether private individuals imitated this practice. It is also not known whether Gildas' reference to "the eastern side of the island" refers to [[Kent]], [[East Anglia]], the [[Kingdom of Northumbria]] or the entire east coast of Britain. Gildas describes how their raids took them "sea to sea, heaped up by the eastern band of impious men; and as it devastated all the neighbouring cities and lands, did not cease after it had been kindled, until it burnt nearly the whole surface of the island, and licked the western ocean with its red and savage tongue" (chapter 24).

===Bede===
The first extant text considering Gildas' account is [[Bede]], writing in the early- to mid-8th century. He mostly paraphrases Gildas in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' and ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'', adding several details, perhaps most importantly the name of this "proud tyrant", whom he first calls ''Vertigernus'' (in his ''Chronica Maiora'') and later ''Vurtigernus'' (in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum''). The ''Vertigernus'' form may reflect an earlier [[Celtic Britons|Celtic]] source or a lost version of Gildas.&lt;ref name="Jones, Michael p.58"&gt;{{cite book |title=The End of Roman Britain |last= Jones |first= Michael E. |year= 1996 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |isbn=978-0-8014-2789-3 |page=58 |oclc=34029750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bede also gives names in the ''Historia'' to the leaders of the Saxons, [[Hengist and Horsa]], specifically identifying their tribes as the Saxons, [[Angles]] and [[Jutes]] (''H.E.'', 1.14,15). Another significant detail that Bede adds to Gildas' account is calling Vortigern the king of the British people.

Bede also supplies the date, 449, which was traditionally accepted but has been considered suspect since the late 20th century: "[[Marcian]] being made emperor with [[Valentinian III|Valentinian]], and the forty-sixth from [[Augustus]], ruled the empire seven years." Michael Jones notes that there are several ''adventus'' dates in Bede. In H.E.&amp;nbsp;1.15 the adventus occurs within the period 449–455; in 1.23 and 5.23 another date, c. 446, is given; in 2.14 the same event is dated 446 or 447. These dates are apparently calculated approximations.&lt;ref name="Jones, Michael p.58"/&gt;

The ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' (History of the Britons) was attributed until recently to [[Nennius]], a monk from [[Bangor, Gwynedd]], and was probably compiled during the early 9th century. The writer mentions a great number of sources. Nennius wrote more negatively of Vortigern, accusing him of [[incest]] (perhaps intentionally mistaking Vortigern for [[Vortiporius]], accused by Gildas of the same crime), oath-breaking, treason, love for a pagan woman, and lesser vices such as pride.

The ''Historia Brittonum'' recounts many details about Vortigern and his sons. Chapters 31–49 tell how Vortigern (Guorthigirn) deals with the Saxons and Saint Germanus of Auxerre. Chapters 50–55 deal with [[Saint Patrick]]. Chapter 56 tells about King Arthur and his battles. Chapters 57–65 mention English genealogies, mingled with [[History of England|English]] and [[History of Wales|Welsh history]]. Chapter 66 gives important chronological calculations, mostly on Vortigern and the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]].

Excluding what is taken from Gildas, there are six groupings of traditions:

* Material quoted from a ''Life of Saint Germanus''. These excerpts describe [[Germanus of Auxerre]]'s incident with one [[Benlli]], an inhospitable host seemingly unrelated to Vortigern who comes to an untimely end; but his servant provides hospitality and is made the progenitor of kings of Powys. They also describe Vortigern's son by his own daughter, whom Germanus raises, and Vortigern's own end caused by fire from heaven brought about by Germanus' prayers. Comparing this material with [[Constantius of Lyon]]'s ''Life of St. Germanus of Auxerre'' suggests that the two are not the same person. It has been suggested that the saint mentioned here may be no more than a local saint or a tale that had to explain all the holy places dedicated to a St. Germanus or a "Garmon", who may have been a Powys saint or even a bishop from the [[Isle of Man]] about the time of writing the ''Historia Britonum''. The story seems only to be explained as a slur against the rival dynasty of Powys, suggesting that they did not descend from Vortigern but from a mere slave.
* Stories that explain why Vortigern granted land in Britain to the Saxons, first to [[Isle of Thanet|Thanet]] in exchange for service as ''foederati'' troops, then to the rest of Kent in exchange for marriage to Hengest's daughter, then to [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]] and [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]] after a banquet where the Saxons treacherously slew all of the leaders of the British but saved Vortigern to extract this ransom. This is no more than an explanatory legend. No finds suggest the origin of Anglo-Saxon occupation in Thanet or Kent; Dorchester-on-Thames (Oxford) is a more likely candidate, as is East Anglia.{{why|date=November 2016}}
* The magical tale of Ambrosius Aurelianus and the two [[European dragon|dragons]] found beneath [[Dinas Emrys]]. This origin of the later legend of [[Merlin]] is clearly a local tale that had attracted the names of Vortigern and Ambrosius to usurp the roles of earlier characters. Neither of them has any association with that remote part of Wales, but the character Vortigern is best known to us because of this tale.
* A number of calculations attempting to fix the year when Vortigern invited the Saxons into Britain. These are made by the writer, naming interesting persons and calculating their dates, making several mistakes in the process.
* Genealogical material about Vortigern's ancestry, including the names of his four sons (Vortimer, [[Pascent]], [[Catigern]], and Faustus), his father Vitalis, his grandfather Vitalinus, and his great-grandfather Gloui, who is probably just an eponym which associates Vortigern with [[Glevum]], the civitas of [[Gloucester]].

The ''Historia Brittonum'' relates four battles occurring in Kent, apparently related to material in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' (see below). It claims that Vortigern's son [[Vortimer]] commanded the Britons against Hengest's Saxons. Moreover, it claims that the Saxons were driven out of Britain, only to return at Vortigern's invitation a few years later, after the death of Vortimer.

The stories preserved in the ''Historia Brittonum'' reveal an attempt by one or more anonymous British scholars to provide more detail to this story, while struggling to accommodate the facts of the British tradition. This is important, as it indicates that near that time there were one or more Welsh kings who traced their genealogy back to Vortigern.

===The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''===
The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' provides dates and locations of four battles which Hengest and his brother Horsa fought against the British in the county of Kent. Vortigern is said to have been the commander of the British for only the first battle; the opponents in the next three battles are variously termed "[[Celtic Britons|British]]" and "[[Welsh people|Welsh]]", which is not unusual for this part of the ''Chronicle''. No Saxon defeat is acknowledged, but the geographical sequence of the battles suggests a Saxon retreat.{{cn|date=May 2017}} The ''Chronicle'' locates the [[Battle of Wippedesfleot]] as the place where the Saxons first landed, dated 465 in ''Wippedsfleot'' and thought to be [[Ebbsfleet, Thanet|Ebbsfleet]] near [[Ramsgate]]. The year 455 is the last date when Vortigern is mentioned. 

However, the ''Chronicle'' is not a single document but the end result of combining several sources over a period of time.{{cn|date=May 2017}} The annals for the 5th century in the ''Chronicle'' were put into their current form during the 9th century, probably during the reign of [[Alfred the Great]].&lt;ref name=MS_xxi&gt;{{cite book |last= Swanton|first= Michael|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|pages=xxi–xxviii |year= 1998|publisher= Routledge |location=New York; London |isbn=0-415-92129-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=f8B4NAl2r48C&amp;pg=PR19&amp;q }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sources are obscure for the fifth century annals; however, an analysis of the text demonstrates some poetic conventions, so it is probable that they were derived from an oral tradition such as [[saga]]s in the form of [[epic poetry|epic poems]].&lt;ref name=jones71&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Michael E.|title= The End of Roman Britain|year= 1988|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, New York|isbn=0-8014-8530-4|page=71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gransen&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gransden|first=Antonia|title=Historical Writing in England c.550-c1307|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paull|location=London|year=1974|isbn=0-7100-7476-X|pages=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is dispute as to when the material was written which comprises the ''Historia Brittonum'', and it could be later than the ''Chronicle''. Some historians argue that the ''Historia Brittonum'' took its material from a source close to the ''Chronicle''.

===William of Malmesbury===
Writing soon before Geoffrey of Monmouth, [[William of Malmesbury|Williamof Malmesbury]] added much to the [[damnatio memoriae]] of Vortigern: 
{{quote|At this time Vortigern was King of Britain; a man calculated neither for the field nor the council, but wholly given up to the lusts of the flesh, the slave of every vice: a character of insatiable avarice, ungovernable pride, and polluted by his lusts. To complete the picture, he had defiled his own daughter, who was lured to the participation of such a crime by the hope of sharing his kingdom, and she had borne him a son. Regardless of his treasures at this dreadful juncture, and wasting the resources of the kingdom in riotous living, he was awake only to the blandishments of abandoned women.|''[[Gesta Regum Anglorum]]''&lt;ref&gt;John Sharpe (trans.), ''The History of the Kings of England and the Modern History of William of Malmsbury'', London: W. Bulmer &amp; Co., 1815.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
No other sources confirm this evil description, and it seems safe to assume that this is an exaggeration of accusations made by earlier writers.

William does, however, add some detail, no doubt because of a good local knowledge. In ''De Gestis Regum Anglorum'' book I, chapter 23.

===Geoffrey of Monmouth===

[[File:Meeting of Vortigern and Rowena.jpg|thumb|''The First Meeting of Vortigern and Rowena'' painted by [[William Hamilton (painter)|William Hamilton]]]]
The story of Vortigern adopted its best-known form in Geoffrey's ''Historia Regum Britanniae''. Geoffrey states that he was the successor of [[Constans II (usurper)|Constans II]], the son of usurping emperor [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantinus III]]. Further, Vortigern used Constans as a [[puppet monarch]] and ruled the nation through him until he finally managed to kill him through the use of insurgent [[Picts]]. 

Geoffrey mentions a similar tale just before that episode, however, which may be an unintentional duplication. Just after the Romans leave, the archbishop of London is put forward by the representatives of Britain to organise the island's defences. To do so, he arranges for continental soldiers to come to Britain. The name of the bishop is Guitelin, a name similar to the Vitalinus mentioned in the ancestry of Vortigern and to the Vitalinus said to have fought with Ambrosius at the [[Battle of Guoloph]]. This Guithelin/Vitalinus disappears from the story as soon as Vortigern arrives. All these coincidences imply that Geoffrey duplicated the story of the invitation of the Saxons,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and that the tale of Guithelinus the archbishop might possibly give some insight into the background of Vortigern before his acquisition of power.

Geoffrey is also the first to mention Hengest's daughter [[Rowena]], who seduces Vortigern to marry her, after which his sons rebel. Geoffrey adds that Vortigern was succeeded briefly by his son Vortimer, as does the ''Historia Brittonum'', only to assume the throne again when Vortimer is killed.

===Wace===
While Vortigern is mentioned only rarely by the later stories of [[King Arthur]], when he does he is usually the character described by either Geoffrey of Monmouth or Wace.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Pillar of Eliseg==

The inscription on the [[Pillar of Eliseg]], a mid-9th century [[stone cross]] in [[North Wales]], gives the [[Old Welsh]] spelling of Vortigern: '''Guarthi[gern]''' (the inscription is now damaged and the final letters of the name are missing), believed to be the same person as Gildas' "superbus tyrannus", Vortigern. The pillar also states that he was married to [[Sevira daughter of Maximus|Sevira]], the daughter of [[Magnus Maximus]], and gave a line of descent leading to the [[Kingdom of Powys|royal family of Powys]], who erected the cross.

==Vortigern as title rather than personal name==

It is occasionally suggested by scholars that Vortigern could be a title rather than a personal name. The name in [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] literally means "Great King" or "Overlord", composed of the elements ''*wor-'' "over-, super" and ''*tigerno-'' "king, lord, chief, ruler" (compare [[Breton language|Old Breton]] ''machtiern'', [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''myghtygern''&lt;ref name="RMN"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Morton Nance| first = Robert | title = A New Cornish–English English Cornish Dictionary | publisher = Agan Tavas | place = Redruth | year = 1991 |isbn= 1-901409-03-1   }}&lt;/ref&gt; a type of local ruler - literally "pledge chief")&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Christopher A., The Britons, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Apr 15, 2008, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; in medieval Brittany and Cornwall.

However, the element ''*tigerno-'' was a regular one in Brittonic personal names (compare [[Saint Mungo|Kentigern]], [[Catigern]], Ritigern, Tigernmaglus, et al.) and, as *wortigernos (or derivatives of it) is not attested as a common noun, there is no reason to suppose that it was used as anything other than a personal name (in fact, an [[Old Irish]] cognate of it, ''Foirtchern'' was a fairly common personal name in medieval Ireland, further lending credence to the notion that Vortigern was a personal name and not a title).

==Local legends==
A valley on the north coast of the [[Llŷn Peninsula]], known as [[Nant Gwrtheyrn]] or "Vortigern's Gorge", is named after Vortigern, and until modern times had a small barrow known locally as "Vortigern's Grave", along with a ruin known as "Vortigern's Fort". However, this conflicts with doubtful reports that he died in his castle on the [[River Teifi]] in [[Dyfed]] (''"Nennius"'') or his tower at [[The Doward]] in [[Herefordshire]] (''Geoffrey of Monmouth'').

Other fortifications associated with Vortigern are at [[Cantref Arfon|Arfon]] in [[Gwynedd]], [[Bradford on Avon]] in [[Wiltshire]], [[Carn Fadryn]] in Gwynedd, [[Clwyd ]]in Powys, [[Llandysul]] in Dyfed, [[Old Carlisle]] in [[Cumberland]], [[Old Sarum]] in Wiltshire, [[Rhayader]] in [[Powys]], [[Snowdon]] and [[Stonehenge]] in Wiltshire.&lt;ref name=vortigernstudies&gt;[http://www.vortigernstudies.org.uk vortigernstudies.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later appearances==
Vortigern's story remained well known after the [[Middle Ages]], especially in [[Great Britain]]. He is a major character in two [[English literature#Jacobean literature|Jacobean plays]], the anonymous ''[[The Birth of Merlin]]'' and [[Thomas Middleton]]'s ''[[Hengist, King of Kent]]'', first published in 1661. His meeting with Rowena became a popular subject in 17th-century engraving and painting, for example [[William Hamilton (painter)|William Hamilton]]'s 1793 work ''Vortigern and Rowena''. He was also featured in literature, such as [[John Lesslie Hall]]'s poems about the beginnings of England.&lt;ref name="Artlit"&gt;{{cite web | first= Robert |last= Vermaat |title= Art and Literature| url= http://www.vortigernstudies.org.uk/artlit/artlit.htm | work= | publisher= Vortigern Studies| year= 2002| accessdate=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Vortigern's most notorious literary appearances is in the play ''[[Vortigern and Rowena]]'', which was promoted as a lost work of [[William Shakespeare]] when it first emerged in 1796. However, it was soon revealed as a [[literary forgery]] written by the play's purported discoverer, [[William Henry Ireland]], who had previously forged a number of other Shakespearean manuscripts. The play was at first accepted as Shakespeare's by some in the literary community, and received a performance at [[London]]'s [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] on 2 April 1796. The play's crude writing, however, exposed it as a forgery, and it was laughed off stage and not performed again. Ireland eventually admitted to the hoax and tried to publish the play by his own name, but had little success.&lt;ref name="NAE"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Ashe | first = Geoffrey | author-link = Geoffrey Ashe | contribution = (Samuel) William Henry Ireland | editor-last = Lacy | editor-first = Norris J | title = The New Arthurian Encyclopedia | volume = | page = 244 | publisher = Garland | place = New York | year = 1991 |isbn= 0-8240-4377-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/ireland.html |title=William Henry Ireland's Shakespeare Forgeries |first=Alex |last=Boese |year=2002 |work= |publisher=[[Museum of Hoaxes]] |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vortigern often appears in [[bibliography of King Arthur|modern Arthurian fiction]]. In the miniseries ''[[Merlin (miniseries)|Merlin]]'' (1998) which uses the legend of Merlin and the dragons, Vortigern is played by [[Rutger Hauer]]. The movie ''[[The Last Legion]]'' (2007), based partly on the [[The Last Legion (novel)|novel of the same name]] (2002) by [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]], features a very fictionalized portrayal of Vortigern under the pseudo-authentic name Vortgyn. Vortigan appears in [[Once Upon a Time (season 5)|season five]] of the TV series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' (2011), portrayed by Darren Moore. [[Jude Law]] portrays Vortigen in the film ''[[King Arthur: Legend of the Sword]]'' (2017), where he is Uther's younger brother, murdering him in order to usurp the throne and sacrificing his own wife and daughter to transform into a demon; he is eventually killed by his nephew Arthur.
