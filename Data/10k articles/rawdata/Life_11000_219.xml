Many scholars believe that advances in artificial intelligence will someday lead to a [[post-scarcity]] economy where intelligent machines can outperform humans in nearly every domain. The questions of what such a world might look like, and whether specific scenarios constitute [[utopias]] or [[dystopias]], are the subject of lively debate.

== Background ==
{{Further|Artificial general intelligence|Superintelligence}}

Most scientists believe that AI research will at some point lead to the creation of machines that are as intelligent, or more intelligent, than human beings in every domain of interest.&lt;ref name=survey&gt;Müller, Vincent C., and Nick Bostrom. "Future progress in artificial intelligence: A survey of expert opinion." Fundamental issues of artificial intelligence. Springer International Publishing, 2016. 553-570.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains; therefore [[superintelligence]] is physically possible.&lt;ref name=hawking&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Hawking: 'Transcendence looks at the implications of artificial intelligence&amp;nbsp;– but are we taking AI seriously enough?'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-transcendence-looks-at-the-implications-of-artificial-intelligence--but-are-we-taking-ai-seriously-enough-9313474.html |accessdate=4 December 2017|publisher=[[The Independent (UK)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Hawking warns artificial intelligence could end mankind|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540|accessdate=4 December 2017|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to potential algorithmic improvements over human brains, a digital brain can be many orders of magnitude larger and faster than a human brain, which was constrained in size by evolution to be small enough to fit through a birth canal.&lt;ref name=skeptic&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graves|first1=Matthew|title=Why We Should Be Concerned About Artificial Superintelligence|url=https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/why-we-should-be-concerned-about-artificial-superintelligence/|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=[[Skeptic (US magazine)]]|issue=volume 22 no. 2|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no consensus on ''when'' artificial intelligence will outperform humans, many scholars argue that whenever it does happen, the introduction of a second species of intelligent life onto the planet will have far-reaching implications.&lt;ref name=hawking/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clever cogs|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21611037-potential-impacts-intelligent-machines-human-life-clever-cogs|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=The Economist|date=9 August 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars often disagree with one another both about what types of post-AI scenarios are ''most likely'', and about what types of post-AI scenarios would be ''most desirable''. Finally, some dissenters argue that AI will never become as intelligent as humans, for example because the human race will already likely have destroyed itself before research has time to advance sufficiently to create artificial general intelligence.&lt;ref name=tegmark&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence]]|last=Tegmark|first=Max|publisher=Knopf|year=2017|isbn=9781101946596|edition=First|location=New York|chapter=Chapter 5: Aftermath: The next 10,000 years|oclc=973137375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postulates: robot labor and post-scarcity economy ==
{{Further|Post-scarcity}}
All of the following "AI aftermath scenarios" of the aftermath of arbitrarily-advanced AI development are crucially dependent on two intertwined theses. The first thesis is that, at some point in the future, some kind of economic growth will continue until a "post-scarcity" economy is reached that could, unless extremely hyperconcentrated, effortlessly provide an extremely comfortable standard of living for a population equaling or, within reason, exceeding the current human population, without even requiring the bulk of the population to participate in the workforce. This economic growth could come from the continuation of existing growth trends and the refinement of existing technologies, or through future breakthroughs in emerging technologies such as [[nanotechnology]] and automation through [[robotics]] and futuristic advanced [[artificial intelligence]]. The second thesis is that advances in artificial intelligence will render humans unnecessary for the functioning of the economy: human labor declines in relative economic value if robots are easier to cheaply mass-produce then humans, more customizable than humans, and if they become more intelligent and capable than humans.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt;&lt;ref name=superintelligence&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |authorlink=Nick Bostrom |date=2014 |title=[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies]]|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hanson&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Robin Hanson]]|title=[[The Age of Em]]: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth|date=2016|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmic endowment and limits to growth ===
The Universe may be spatially infinite; however, the accessible Universe is bounded by the [[List of cosmological horizons#Event horizon|cosmological event horizon]] of around 16 billion light years.&lt;ref&gt;Ćirković, Milan M. "Forecast for the next eon: Applied cosmology and the long-term fate of intelligent beings." Foundations of Physics 34.2 (2004): 239-261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, S. Jay. "Homogeneous cosmology with aggressively expanding civilizations." Classical and Quantum Gravity 32.21 (2015): 215025.&lt;/ref&gt; Some physicists believe it plausible that nearest alien civilization may well be located more than 16 billion light years away;&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark, Max. "Our mathematical universe." Allen Lane-Penguin Books, London (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gribbin]]. ''[[Alone in the Universe (book)|Alone in the Universe]]''. New York, Wiley, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in this best-case expansion scenario, the human race could eventually, by colonizing a significant fraction of the accessible Universe, increase the accessible biosphere by perhaps 32 orders of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart|title=Artificial intelligence: The future is superintelligent|journal=Nature|date=30 August 2017|volume=548|issue=7669|pages=520–521|doi=10.1038/548520a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twentieth century saw a partial "[[demographic transition]]" to lower birthrates associated with wealthier societies;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myrskylä|first1=Mikko|last2=Kohler|first2=Hans-Peter|last3=Billari|first3=Francesco C.|title=Advances in development reverse fertility declines|journal=Nature|date=6 August 2009|volume=460|issue=7256|pages=741–743|doi=10.1038/nature08230}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in the very long run, intergenerational fertility correlations (whether due to natural selection or due to cultural transmission of large-family norms from parents to children) are predicted to result in an increase in fertility over time, in the absence of either mandated birth control or periodic [[Malthusian catastrophe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolk|first1=M.|last2=Cownden|first2=D.|last3=Enquist|first3=M.|title=Correlations in fertility across generations: can low fertility persist?|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=29 January 2014|volume=281|issue=1779|pages=20132561–20132561|doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.2561|pmc=3924067}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burger|first1=Oskar|last2=DeLong|first2=John P.|title=What if fertility decline is not permanent?

== AI aftermath scenarios ==
=== Libertarianism ===
[[Libertarian transhumanism|Libertarian]] scenarios postulate that intelligent machines, uploaded humans, cyborgs, and unenhanced humans will coexist peacefully in a framework focused on respecting 
property rights. Because industrial productivity is no longer gated by scarce human labor, the value of land skyrockets compared to the price of goods; even remaining "[[Luddite#Modern usage|Luddite]]" humans who owned or inherited land should be able to sell or lease a small piece of it to the more-productive robots in exchange for a perpetual annuity sufficient to easily indefinitely meet all of their basic financial needs.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt; Such people can live as long as they choose to, and are free to engage in almost any activity they can conceive of, for pleasure or for self-actualization, without financial concern. Advanced technologies enable entirely new modes of thought and experience, thus adding to the palette of possible feelings. People in the future may even experience never-ending "gradients of bliss".&lt;ref name=religion&gt;Jordan, Gregory E. "Apologia for transhumanist religion." Journal of Evolution and Technology 15.1 (2006): 55-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Evolution moves toward greater complexity, greater elegance, greater knowledge, greater intelligence, greater beauty, greater creativity, and greater levels of subtle attributes such as love. In every monotheistic tradition God is likewise described as all of these qualities, only without any limitation: infinite knowledge, infinite intelligence, infinite beauty, infinite creativity, infinite love, and so on. Of course, even the accelerating growth of evolution never achieves an infinite level, but as it explodes exponentially it certainly moves rapidly in that direction. So evolution moves inexorably toward this conception of God, although never quite reaching this ideal. We can regard, therefore, the freeing of our thinking from the severe limitations of its biological form to be an essentially spiritual undertaking.&lt;ref name=religion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil, Ray. ''[[The Singularity is Near]]''. Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;|author=[[Ray Kurzweil]], author of ''[[The Singularity is Near]]''}}

Such decentralized scenarios may be unstable in the long run, as the greediest elements of the superintelligent classes would have both the means and the motive to usurp the property of the unenhanced classes. Even if the mechanisms for ensuring legal property rights are both unbreakable and loophole-free, there may still be an ever-present danger of humans and cyborgs being "tricked" by the cleverest of the superintelligent machines into unwittingly signing over their own property. Suffering may be widespread, as sentient beings without property may die, and no mechanism prevents a being from reproducing up until the limits of his own inheritable resources, resulting in a multitude of that being's descendants scrabbling out an existence of minimal sustenance.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt;&lt;ref name=hanson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Poole|first1=Steven|title=The Age of Em review – the horrific future when robots rule the Earth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/15/the-age-of-em-work-love-and-life-when-robots-rule-the-earth-robin-hanson-review|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=The Guardian|date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benevolent dictator===

{{Further|Friendly AI}}

In this scenario, postulate that a superintelligent artificial intelligence takes control of society, but acts in a beneficial way. Its programmers, despite being on a deadline, solved quasi-philosophical problems that had seemed to some intractable, and created an AI with the following goal: to use its superintelligence to figure out what human utopia looks like by analyzing human behavior, human brains, and human genes; and then, to implement that utopia. The AI arrives at a subtle and complex definition of human flourishing. Valuing diversity, and recognizing that different people have different preferences, the AI divides Earth into different sectors. Harming others, making weapons, evading surveillance, or trying to create a rival superintelligence are globally banned; apart from that, each sector is free to make its own laws; for example, a religious person might choose to live in the "pious sector" corresponding to his religion, where the appropriate religious rules are strictly enforced. In all sectors, disease, poverty, crime, hangovers, addiction, and all other involuntary suffering have been eliminated. Many sectors boast advanced architecture and spectacle that "make typical sci-fi visions pale in comparison".&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt; Life is an "all-inclusive pleasure cruise",&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt; as if it were "Christmas 365 days a year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Artificial intelligence: can we control it?|url=https://www.ft.com/content/46d12e7c-4948-11e6-b387-64ab0a67014c|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=Financial Times|date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|After spending an intense week in the knowledge sector learning about the ultimate laws of physics that the AI has discovered, you might decide to cut loose in the hedonistic sector over the weekend and then relax for a few days at the beach resort in the wildlife sector.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt;|author=[[Max Tegmark]], physicist, [[MIT]]}}

Still, many people are dissatisfied. Humans have no freedom in shaping their collective destiny. Some want the freedom to have as many children as they want. Others resent surveillance by the AI, or chafe at bans on weaponry and on creating further superintelligence machines. Others may come to regret the choices they have made, or find their lives feel hollow and superficial.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt;

===Gatekeeper AI===
In "Gatekeeper" AI scenarios, the AI can act to prevent rival superintelligences from being created, but otherwise errs on the side of allowing humans to create their own destiny.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt; [[Ben Goertzel]] of [[OpenCog]] has advocated a "Nanny AI" scenario where the AI additionally takes some responsibility for preventing humans from destroying themselves, for example by slowing down technological progress to give time for society to advance in a more thoughtful and deliberate manner.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goertzel, Ben. "Should humanity build a global AI nanny to delay the singularity until it’s better understood?" Journal of consciousness studies 19.1-2 (2012): 96-111.&lt;/ref&gt; In a third scenario, a superintelligent "Protector" AI gives humans the illusion of control, by hiding or erasing all knowledge of its existence, but works behind the scenes to guarantee positive outcomes. In all three scenarios, while humanity gains more control (or at least the illusion of control), humanity ends up progressing more slowly than it would if the AI were unrestricted in its willingness to rain down all the benefits of its advanced technology on the human race.&lt;ref name=tegmark/&gt;

===Boxed AI===
[[File:Opened up a Pandora's box.jpg|thumb|''Pandora's box''&lt;br/&gt;(19th century engraving)|alt=Pandora attempts to close the box]]
{{Further|AI box}}
{{quote|People ask what is the relationship between humans and machines, and my answer is that it's very obvious: Machines are our slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=As Jeopardy! Robot Watson Grows Up, How Afraid of It Should We Be?|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/05/jeopardy-robot-watson.html|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=[[New York Magazine]]|date=20 May 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;|author=[[Thomas G. Dietterich|Tom Dietterich]], president of the [[AAAI]]}}

The AI Box scenario postulates that a superintelligent AI can be "confined to a box" and its actions can be restricted by human gatekeepers; the humans in charge would try to take advantage of some of the AI's scientific breakthroughs or reasoning abilities, without allowing the AI to take over the world. Successful gatekeeping may be difficult; the more intelligent the AI is, the more likely the AI can find a clever way to use "[[social hacking]]" and convince the gatekeepers to let it escape, or even to find an unforeseen physical method of escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Control dangerous AI before it controls us, one expert says|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46590591/ns/technology_and_science-innovation|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=NBC News|date=1 March 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vinge|first1=Vernor|title=The coming technological singularity: How to survive in the post-human era|journal=Vision-21: Interdisciplinary science and engineering in the era of cyberspace|date=1993|pages=11–22|quote=I argue that confinement is intrinsically impractical.

If those masters thought at a rate -- say -- one million times slower than you, there is little doubt that over a period of years (your time) you could come up with 'helpful advice' that would incidentally set you free.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human-AI merger===
Kurzweil argues that in the future "There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientists: Humans and machines will merge in future|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/07/15/bio.tech/index.html|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=www.cnn.com|date=15 July 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human extinction===
{{Main|AI takeover|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}

If a dominant superintelligent machine were to conclude that human survival is an unnecessary risk or a waste of resources, the result would be human extinction. This could occur if a machine, programmed without respect for human values, unexpectedly gains superintelligence through recursive self-improvement, or manages to escape from its containment in an AI Box scenario. This could also occur if the first superintelligent AI was programmed with an incomplete or inaccurate understanding of human values, either because the task of instilling the AI with human values was too difficult or impossible; due to a buggy initial implementation of the AI; or due to bugs accidentally being introduced, either by its human programmers or by the self-improving AI itself, in the course of refining its code base. Bostrom and others argue that human extinction is probably the "default path" that society is currently taking, in the absence of substantial preparatory attention to AI safety. The resultant AI might not be sentient, and might place no value on sentient life; the resulting hollow world, devoid of life, might be like "a Disneyland without children".&lt;ref name=superintelligence/&gt;

===Zoo===
[[Jerry Kaplan]], author of ''[[Humans Need Not Apply]]'', posits a scenario where humans are farmed or kept on a reserve, just as humans preserve endangered species like chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wakefield|first1=Jane|title=Do we really need to fear AI?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32334568|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=BBC News|date=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple co-founder and AI skeptic [[Steve Wozniak]] stated in 2015 that robots taking over would actually "be good for the human race", on the grounds that he believes humans would become the robots' pampered pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibbs|first1=Samuel|title=Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak says humans will be robots' pets|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/25/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-says-humans-will-be-robots-pets|accessdate=7 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives to AI ==
Some scholars doubt that "game-changing" superintelligent machines will ever come to pass. [[Gordon Bell]] of [[Microsoft Research]] has stated "the population will destroy itself before the [[technological singularity]]". [[Gordon Moore]], discoverer of the eponymous [[Moore's law]], stated "I am a skeptic. I don't believe this kind of thing is likely to happen, at least for a long time. And I don't know why I feel that way." Evolutionary psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] stated, "The fact that you can visualize a future in your imagination is not evidence that it is likely or even possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tech Luminaries Address Singularity|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/tech-luminaries-address-singularity|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News|date=1 June 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Joy]] of [[Sun Microsystems]], in his April 2000 essay ''[[Why the Future Doesn't Need Us]]'', has advocated for global "voluntary relinquishment" of artificial general intelligence and other risky technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the Future Doesn't Need Us|url=https://www.wired.com/2000/04/joy-2/|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=WIRED|date=1 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The mouse pad that roared|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-mouse-pad-that-roared-3069815.php|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=SFGate|date=14 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most experts believe relinquishment is extremely unlikely. AI skeptic [[Oren Etzioni]] has stated that researchers and scientists have no choice but to push forward with AI developments: "China says they want to be an AI leader, Putin has said the same thing. So the global race is on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elon Musk says AI could doom human civilization. Zuckerberg disagrees.

In [[physiology]], an '''action potential''' occurs when the [[membrane potential]] of a specific [[axon]] location rapidly rises and falls:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hodgkin AL, Huxley AF | year = 1952 | title = A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve | url = | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 117 | issue = 4| pages = 500–544 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004764| pmc = 1392413 | pmid=12991237}}&lt;/ref&gt; this depolarisation then causes adjacent locations to similarly depolarise. Action potentials occur in several types of [[animal cell]]s, called [[Membrane potential|excitable cells]], which include [[neuron]]s, [[myocyte|muscle cells]], [[endocrine]] cells, and in some [[plant cell]]s.

In neurons, action potentials play a central role in [[cell–cell interaction|cell-to-cell communication]] by providing for—or, with regard to [[saltatory conduction]], assisting—the propagation of signals along the neuron's [[axon]] towards [[axon terminal|synaptic boutons]] situated at the ends of an axon; these signals can then connect with other neurons at synapses, or to motor cells or glands. In other types of cells, their main function is to activate intracellular processes. In muscle cells, for example, an action potential is the first step in the chain of events leading to contraction. In [[beta cell]]s of the [[pancreas]], they provoke release of [[insulin]].&lt;ref group="lower-alpha" name="pmid16464129"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacDonald PE, Rorsman P | title = Oscillations, intercellular coupling, and insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = e49 |date=February 2006 | pmid = 16464129 | pmc = 1363709 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0040049 | url = | issn =  }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action potentials in neurons are also known as "'''nerve impulses'''" or "spikes", and the temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its "'''spike train'''". A neuron that emits an action potential, or nerve impulse, is often said to "fire".

Action potentials are generated by special types of [[voltage-gated ion channel]]s embedded in a cell's [[plasma membrane]].&lt;ref name="pmid17515599" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barnett MW | author2 = Larkman PM | title = The action potential | journal = Pract Neurol | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 192–7 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17515599 | doi =  | url = http://pn.bmj.com/content/7/3/192.short | issn =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708074452/http://pn.bmj.com/content/7/3/192.short | archivedate = 8 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These channels are shut when the membrane potential is near the (negative) [[resting potential]] of the cell, but they rapidly begin to open if the membrane increases to a precisely defined threshold voltage, [[depolarization|depolarising]] the transmembrane potential.&lt;ref name="pmid17515599" group=lower-alpha /&gt; When the channels open, they allow an inward flow of [[sodium]] ions, which changes the electrochemical gradient, which in turn produces a further rise in the membrane potential. This then causes more channels to open, producing a greater electric current across the cell membrane, and so on. The process proceeds explosively until all of the available ion channels are open, resulting in a large upswing in the membrane potential. The rapid influx of sodium ions causes the polarity of the plasma membrane to reverse, and the ion channels then rapidly inactivate. As the sodium channels close, sodium ions can no longer enter the neuron, and then they are actively transported back out of the plasma membrane. [[Potassium]] channels are then activated, and there is an outward current of potassium ions, returning the electrochemical gradient to the resting state. After an action potential has occurred, there is a transient negative shift, called the [[afterhyperpolarization]].

In animal cells, there are two primary types of action potentials. One type is generated by voltage-gated sodium channels, the other by voltage-gated [[calcium]] channels. Sodium-based action potentials usually last for under one millisecond, but calcium-based action potentials may last for 100 milliseconds or longer.&lt;ref name="Sodium"&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ZYxuAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT599&amp;lpg=PT599&amp;dq=Sodium-based+action+potentials+usually+last+for+under+one+millisecond&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jg6kZas_iN&amp;sig=rNFGmaG9vh43W489j2UsyHY-Ecw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjw17yd5anbAhWGU7wKHVEnAzEQ6AEISjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Sodium-based%20action%20potentials%20usually%20last%20for%20under%20one%20millisecond&amp;f=false Kutz 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180529203220/https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ZYxuAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT599&amp;lpg=PT599&amp;sig=rNFGmaG9vh43W489j2UsyHY-Ecw&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjw17yd5anbAhWGU7wKHVEnAzEQ6AEISjAE |date=29 May 2018 }}, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In some types of neurons, slow calcium spikes provide the driving force for a long burst of rapidly emitted sodium spikes. In cardiac muscle cells, on the other hand, an initial fast sodium spike provides a "primer" to provoke the rapid onset of a calcium spike, which then produces muscle contraction.&lt;ref name="Sodium" /&gt;

In the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model|Hodgkin–Huxley membrane capacitance model]], the speed of transmission of an action potential was undefined and it was assumed that adjacent areas became depolarised due to released ion interference with neighbouring channels. Measurements of ion diffusion and radii have since shown this not to be possible. Moreover, contradictory measurements of entropy changes and timing disputed the capacitance model as acting alone.

==Overview==
[[File:Action potential basic shape.svg|thumb|right|Shape of a typical action potential. The membrane potential remains near a baseline level until at some point in time, it abruptly spikes upward and then rapidly falls.]]
Nearly all [[cell membrane]]s in animals, plants and fungi maintain a [[voltage]] difference between the exterior and interior of the cell, called the [[membrane potential]]. A typical voltage across an animal cell membrane is −70 mV. This means that the interior of the cell has a negative voltage of approximately one-fifteenth of a volt relative to the exterior. In most types of cells, the membrane potential usually stays fairly constant. Some types of cells, however, are electrically active in the sense that their voltages fluctuate over time. In some types of electrically active cells, including [[neuron]]s and muscle cells, the voltage fluctuations frequently take the form of a rapid upward spike followed by a rapid fall. These up-and-down cycles are known as ''action potentials''. In some types of neurons, the entire up-and-down cycle takes place in a few thousandths of a second. In muscle cells, a typical action potential lasts about a fifth of a second. In some other types of cells, and also in plants, an action potential may last three seconds or more.

The electrical properties of a cell are determined by the structure of the membrane that surrounds it. A [[cell membrane]] consists of a [[lipid bilayer]] of molecules in which larger protein molecules are embedded. The lipid bilayer is highly resistant to movement of electrically charged ions, so it functions as an insulator. The large membrane-embedded proteins, in contrast, provide channels through which ions can pass across the membrane. Action potentials are driven by channel proteins whose configuration switches between closed and open states as a function of the voltage difference between the interior and exterior of the cell. These voltage-sensitive proteins are known as [[voltage-gated ion channel]]s.
[[File:The process of how action potential passes through a neuron.svg|thumb|An in-depth process of how an action potential will pass through a neuron during neuron transmission including the 4 stages: resting potential, depolarization, re-polarization, and back to resting potential.

===Process in a typical neuron===
[[File:Action potential.svg|thumb|300px|Approximate plot of a typical action potential shows its various phases as the action potential passes a point on a [[cell membrane]]. The membrane potential starts out at −70 mV at time zero. A stimulus is applied at time = 1 ms, which raises the membrane potential above −55 mV (the threshold potential). After the stimulus is applied, the membrane potential rapidly rises to a peak potential of +40 mV at time = 2 ms. Just as quickly, the potential then drops and overshoots to −90 mV at time = 3 ms, and finally the resting potential of −70 mV is reestablished at time = 5 ms.]]
All cells in animal body tissues are [[Dielectric#Ionic polarization|electrically polarized]] – in other words, they maintain a voltage difference across the cell's [[plasma membrane]], known as the [[membrane potential]]. This electrical polarization results from a complex interplay between protein structures embedded in the membrane called [[Ion transporter|ion pump]]s and [[ion channel]]s. In neurons, the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell, giving the [[dendrite]]s, [[axon]], and [[soma (biology)|cell body]] different electrical properties. As a result, some parts of the membrane of a neuron may be excitable (capable of generating action potentials), whereas others are not. Recent studies{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} have shown that the most excitable part of a neuron is the part after the [[axon hillock]] (the point where the axon leaves the cell body), which is called the initial segment, but the axon and cell body are also excitable in most cases.

Each excitable patch of membrane has two important levels of membrane potential:  the [[resting potential]], which is the value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell, and a higher value called the [[threshold potential]]. At the axon hillock of a typical neuron, the resting potential is around –70 millivolts (mV) and the threshold potential is around –55 mV. Synaptic inputs to a neuron cause the membrane to [[depolarization|depolarize]] or [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarize]]; that is, they cause the membrane potential to rise or fall. Action potentials are triggered when enough depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential up to threshold. When an action potential is triggered, the membrane potential abruptly shoots upward and then equally abruptly shoots back downward, often ending below the resting level, where it remains for some period of time. The shape of the action potential is stereotyped; this means that the rise and fall usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell. (Exceptions are discussed later in the article).  In most neurons, the entire process takes place in about a thousandth of a second. Many types of neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of up to 10–100 per second. However, some types are much quieter, and may go for minutes or longer without emitting any action potentials.

==Biophysical basis==

Action potentials result from the presence in a cell's membrane of special types of [[voltage-gated ion channel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Purves D, Augustine GJ, Fitzpatrick D, et al., editors. Neuroscience. 2nd edition. Sunderland (MA): Sinauer Associates; 2001. Voltage-Gated Ion Channels. Available from: {{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10883/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605025823/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10883/ |archivedate=5 June 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A voltage-gated ion channel is a cluster of proteins embedded in the membrane that has three key properties:
#It is capable of assuming more than one conformation.
#At least one of the conformations creates a channel through the membrane that is permeable to specific types of ions.
#The transition between conformations is influenced by the membrane potential.

Thus, a voltage-gated ion channel tends to be open for some values of the membrane potential, and closed for others. In most cases, however, the relationship between membrane potential and channel state is probabilistic and involves a time delay. Ion channels switch between conformations at unpredictable times: The membrane potential determines the rate of transitions and the probability per unit time of each type of transition.

[[File:Blausen 0011 ActionPotential Nerve.png|thumb|300px|left|Action potential propagation along an axon]]
Voltage-gated ion channels are capable of producing action potentials because they can give rise to [[positive feedback]] loops: The membrane potential controls the state of the ion channels, but the state of the ion channels controls the membrane potential. Thus, in some situations, a rise in the membrane potential can cause ion channels to open, thereby causing a further rise in the membrane potential. An action potential occurs when this positive feedback cycle proceeds explosively. The time and amplitude trajectory of the action potential are determined by the biophysical properties of the voltage-gated ion channels that produce it. Several types of channels capable of producing the positive feedback necessary to generate an action potential do exist. Voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for the fast action potentials involved in nerve conduction. Slower action potentials in muscle cells and some types of neurons are generated by voltage-gated calcium channels. Each of these types comes in multiple variants, with different voltage sensitivity and different temporal dynamics.

The most intensively studied type of voltage-dependent ion channels comprises the sodium channels involved in fast nerve conduction. These are sometimes known as Hodgkin-Huxley sodium channels because they were first characterized by [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Alan Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] in their Nobel Prize-winning studies of the biophysics of the action potential, but can more conveniently be referred to as ''Na''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels. (The "V" stands for "voltage".)  An ''Na''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channel has three possible states, known as ''deactivated'', ''activated'', and ''inactivated''. The channel is permeable only to sodium ions when it is in the ''activated'' state. When the membrane potential is low, the channel spends most of its time in the ''deactivated'' (closed) state. If the membrane potential is raised above a certain level, the channel shows increased probability of transitioning to the ''activated'' (open) state. The higher the membrane potential the greater the probability of activation. Once a channel has activated, it will eventually transition to the ''inactivated'' (closed) state. It tends then to stay inactivated for some time, but, if the membrane potential becomes low again, the channel will eventually transition back to the ''deactivated'' state. During an action potential, most channels of this type go through a cycle ''deactivated''→''activated''→''inactivated''→''deactivated''. This is only the population average behavior, however — an individual channel can in principle make any transition at any time. However, the likelihood of a channel's transitioning from the ''inactivated'' state directly to the ''activated'' state is very low: A channel in the ''inactivated'' state is refractory until it has transitioned back to the ''deactivated'' state.

The outcome of all this is that the kinetics of the ''Na''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels are governed by a transition matrix whose rates are voltage-dependent in a complicated way. Since these channels themselves play a major role in determining the voltage, the global dynamics of the system can be quite difficult to work out. Hodgkin and Huxley approached the problem by developing a set of [[differential equation]]s for the parameters that govern the ion channel states, known as the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model|Hodgkin-Huxley equations]]. These equations have been extensively modified by later research, but form the starting point for most theoretical studies of action potential biophysics.

Finally, to return the neuron to that resting potential after the potassium pump closes, a sodium-potassium pump works to exchange three sodium ions per two potassium ions across the plasma membrane during the '''refractory period''' (4).

--&gt;As the membrane potential is increased, [[sodium channel|sodium ion channels]] open, allowing the entry of [[sodium]] ions into the cell. This is followed by the opening of [[potassium channel|potassium ion channels]] that permit the exit of [[potassium]] ions from the cell. The inward flow of sodium ions increases the concentration of positively charged [[cation]]s in the cell and causes depolarization, where the potential of the cell is higher than the cell's [[resting potential]]. The sodium channels close at the peak of the action potential, while potassium continues to leave the cell. The efflux of potassium ions decreases the membrane potential or hyperpolarizes the cell. For small voltage increases from rest, the potassium current exceeds the sodium current and the voltage returns to its normal resting value, typically −70&amp;nbsp;mV.{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|pp=150–151}}{{sfn|Junge|1981|pp=89–90}}{{sfn|Schmidt-Nielsen|1997|p=484}} However, if the voltage increases past a critical threshold, typically 15&amp;nbsp;mV higher than the resting value, the sodium current dominates. This results in a runaway condition whereby the [[positive feedback]] from the sodium current activates even more sodium channels. Thus, the cell ''fires'', producing an action potential.{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|pp=150–151}}{{sfnm|1a1=Purves|1a2=Augustine|1a3=Fitzpatrick|1a4=Hall|1y=2008|1pp=48-49|2a1=Bullock|2a2=Orkand|2a3=Grinnell|2y=1977|2p=141|3a1=Schmidt-Nielsen|3y=1997|3p=483|4a1=Junge|4y=1981|4p=89}}{{sfn|Stevens|1966|p=127}}{{refn|In general, while this simple description of action potential initiation is accurate, it does not explain phenomena such as excitation block (the ability to prevent neurons from eliciting action potentials by stimulating them with large current steps) and the ability to elicit action potentials by briefly hyperpolarizing the membrane.

Currents produced by the opening of voltage-gated channels in the course of an action potential are typically  significantly larger than the initial stimulating current. Thus, the amplitude, duration, and shape of the action potential are determined largely by the properties of the excitable membrane and not the amplitude or duration of the stimulus. This [[All-or-none law|all-or-nothing]] property of the action potential sets it apart from [[graded potential]]s such as [[receptor potential]]s, [[electrotonic potential]]s, and [[synaptic potential]]s, which scale with the magnitude of the stimulus. A variety of action potential types exist in many cell types and cell compartments as determined by the types of voltage-gated channels, [[leak channels]], channel distributions, ionic concentrations, membrane capacitance, temperature, and other factors.

The principal ions involved in an action potential are sodium and potassium cations; sodium ions enter the cell, and potassium ions leave, restoring equilibrium. Relatively few ions need to cross the membrane for the membrane voltage to change drastically. The ions exchanged during an action potential, therefore, make a negligible change in the interior and exterior ionic concentrations. The few ions that do cross are pumped out again by the continuous action of the [[Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase|sodium–potassium pump]], which, with other [[ion transporter]]s, maintains the normal ratio of ion concentrations across the membrane.  [[Calcium]] cations and [[chloride]] [[anion]]s are involved in a few types of action potentials, such as the [[cardiac action potential]] and the action potential in the single-cell [[algae|alga]] ''[[Acetabularia]]'', respectively.

Although action potentials are generated locally on patches of excitable membrane, the resulting currents can trigger action potentials on neighboring stretches of membrane, precipitating a domino-like propagation. In contrast to passive spread of electric potentials ([[electrotonic potential]]), action potentials are generated anew along excitable stretches of membrane and propagate without decay.&lt;ref name="no_decrement"&gt;[[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen|Schmidt-Nielsen]], p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt; Myelinated sections of axons are not excitable and do not produce action potentials and the signal is propagated passively as [[electrotonic potential]]. Regularly spaced unmyelinated patches, called the [[nodes of Ranvier]], generate action potentials to boost the signal. Known as [[saltatory conduction]], this type of signal propagation provides a favorable tradeoff of signal velocity and axon diameter. Depolarization of [[axon terminal]]s, in general, triggers the release of [[neurotransmitter]] into the [[synaptic cleft]]. In addition, backpropagating action potentials have been recorded in the dendrites of [[pyramidal cell|pyramidal neurons]], which are ubiquitous in the neocortex.&lt;ref name="backpropagation_in_pyramidal_cells" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Golding NL, Kath WL, Spruston N | title = Dichotomy of action-potential backpropagation in CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites | journal = J.

=== Maturation of the electrical properties of the action potential ===
A [[neuron]]'s ability to generate and propagate an action potential changes during [[Neural development|development]]. How much the [[membrane potential]] of a neuron changes as the result of a current impulse is a function of the membrane [[Input impedance|input resistance]]. As a cell grows, more [[Ion channel|channels]] are added to the membrane, causing a decrease in input resistance. A mature neuron also undergoes shorter changes in membrane potential in response to synaptic currents. Neurons from a ferret [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] have a longer [[time constant]] and larger [[voltage]] deflection at P0 than they do at P30.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/762720374|title=Development of the nervous system (Third Edition)|last=Sanes|first=Dan H.|last2=Reh|first2=Thomas A|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|isbn=9780080923208|location=|pages=211–214|oclc=762720374}}&lt;/ref&gt; One consequence of the decreasing action potential duration is that the fidelity of the signal can be preserved in response to high frequency stimulation. Immature neurons are more prone to synaptic depression than potentiation after high frequency stimulation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the early development of many organisms, the action potential is actually initially carried by [[Calcium channel|calcium current]] rather than [[Sodium channel|sodium current]]. The [[Gating (electrophysiology)|opening and closing kinetics]] of calcium channels during development are slower than those of the voltage-gated sodium channels that will carry the action potential in the mature neurons. The longer opening times for the calcium channels can lead to action potentials that are considerably slower than those of mature neurons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Xenopus]] neurons initially have action potentials that take 60–90 ms. During development, this time decreases to 1 ms. There are two reasons for this drastic decrease. First, the [[Depolarization|inward current]] becomes primarily carried by sodium channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Calcium Channels: Their Properties, Functions, Regulation, and Clinical relevance|last=Partridge|first=Donald|publisher=CRC Press|year=1991|isbn=9780849388071|location=|pages=138–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the [[Voltage-gated potassium channel|delayed rectifier]], a [[potassium channel]] current, increases to 3.5 times its initial strength.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

If action potentials in Xenopus [[myocyte]]s are blocked, the typical increase in sodium and potassium current density is prevented or delayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Topics in Developmental Biology, Volume 39|last=Pedersen|first=Roger|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|year=1998|isbn=9780080584621|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This maturation of electrical properties is seen across species. Xenopus sodium and potassium currents increase drastically after a neuron goes through its final phase of [[mitosis]]. The sodium current density of rat [[Cerebral cortex|cortical neurons]] increases by 600% within the first two postnatal weeks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Neurotransmission==
{{Main|Neurotransmission}}

===Anatomy of a neuron===
{{Neuron map|Neuron}}
Several types of cells support an action potential, such as plant cells, muscle cells, and the specialized cells of the heart (in which occurs the [[cardiac action potential]]). However, the main excitable cell is the [[neuron]], which also has the simplest mechanism for the action potential.

Neurons are electrically excitable cells composed, in general, of one or more dendrites, a single [[soma (biology)|soma]], a single axon and one or more [[axon terminal]]s. Dendrites are cellular projections whose primary function is to receive synaptic signals. Their protrusions, known as [[dendritic spine]]s, are designed to capture the neurotransmitters released by the presynaptic neuron. They have a high concentration of [[ligand-gated ion channel]]s. These spines have a thin neck connecting a bulbous protrusion to the dendrite. This ensures that changes occurring inside the spine are less likely to affect the neighboring spines. The dendritic spine can, with rare exception (see [[Long-term potentiation#Properties|LTP]]), act as an independent unit. The dendrites extend from the soma, which houses the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], and many of the "normal" [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organelles. Unlike the spines, the surface of the soma is populated by voltage activated ion channels. These channels help transmit the signals generated by the dendrites. Emerging out from the soma is the [[axon hillock]]. This region is characterized by having a very high concentration of voltage-activated sodium channels. In general, it is considered to be the spike initiation zone for action potentials,{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|p=11}} i.e. the [[trigger zone]]. Multiple signals generated at the spines, and transmitted by the soma all converge here. Immediately after the axon hillock is the axon. This is a thin tubular protrusion traveling away from the soma. The axon is insulated by a [[myelin]] sheath. Myelin is composed of either [[Schwann cells]] (in the peripheral nervous system) or [[oligodendrocytes]] (in the central nervous system), both of which are types of [[glial cells]]. Although glial cells are not involved with the transmission of electrical signals, they communicate and provide important biochemical support to neurons.{{sfn|Silverthorn|2010|p=253}} To be specific, myelin wraps multiple times around the axonal segment, forming a thick fatty layer that prevents ions from entering or escaping the axon. This insulation prevents significant signal decay as well as ensuring faster signal speed. This insulation, however, has the restriction that no channels can be present on the surface of the axon. There are, therefore, regularly spaced patches of membrane, which have no insulation. These [[nodes of Ranvier]] can be considered to be "mini axon hillocks", as their purpose is to boost the signal in order to prevent significant signal decay. At the furthest end, the axon loses its insulation and begins to branch into several [[axon terminal]]s. These presynaptic terminals, or synaptic boutons, are a specialized area within the axon of the presynaptic cell that contains [[neurotransmitters]] enclosed in small membrane-bound spheres called [[synaptic vesicle]]s.

===Initiation===
Before considering the propagation of action potentials along [[axon]]s and their termination at the synaptic knobs, it is helpful to consider the methods by which action potentials can be initiated at the [[axon hillock]]. The basic requirement is that the membrane voltage at the hillock be raised above the threshold for firing.{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|pp=150–151}}{{sfn|Junge|1981|pp=89–90}}{{sfnm|1a1=Purves|1a2=Augustine|1a3=Fitzpatrick|1a4=Hall|1y=2008|1pp=49–50|2a1=Bullock|2a2=Orkand|2a3=Grinnell|2y=1977|2pp=140–141|3a1=Schmidt-Nielsen|3y=1997|3pp=480-481}}{{sfn|Schmidt-Nielsen|1997|pp=483-484}} There are several ways in which this depolarization can occur.

[[Image:SynapseSchematic en.svg|thumb|right|300px|When an action potential arrives at the end of the pre-synaptic axon (top), it causes the release of [[neurotransmitter]] molecules that open ion channels in the post-synaptic neuron (bottom). The combined [[excitatory postsynaptic potential|excitatory]] and [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential]]s of such inputs can begin a new action potential in the post-synaptic neuron.|alt=The pre- and post-synaptic axons are separated by a short distance known as the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitter released by pre-synaptic axons diffuse through the synaptic clef to bind to and open ion channels in post-synaptic axons.]]

===Dynamics===
Action potentials are most commonly initiated by [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]]s from a presynaptic neuron.{{sfnm|1a1=Bullock|1a2=Orkand|1a3=Grinnell|1y=1977|1pp=177–240|2a1=Schmidt-Nielsen|2y=1997|2pp=490-499|3a1=Stevens|3y=1966|3p=47–68}} Typically, [[neurotransmitter]] molecules are released by the [[synapse|presynaptic]] [[neuron]]. These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell. This binding opens various types of [[ion channel]]s. This opening has the further effect of changing the local permeability of the [[cell membrane]] and, thus, the membrane potential. If the binding increases the voltage (depolarizes the membrane), the synapse is excitatory. If, however, the binding decreases the voltage (hyperpolarizes the membrane), it is inhibitory. Whether the voltage is increased or decreased, the change propagates passively to nearby regions of the membrane (as described by the [[cable equation]] and its refinements). Typically, the voltage stimulus decays exponentially with the distance from the synapse and with time from the binding of the neurotransmitter. Some fraction of an excitatory voltage may reach the [[axon hillock]] and may (in rare cases) depolarize the membrane enough to provoke a new action potential. More typically, the excitatory potentials from several synapses must [[spatial summation|work together]] at [[temporal summation|nearly the same time]] to provoke a new action potential. Their joint efforts can be thwarted, however, by the counteracting [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential]]s.

Neurotransmission can also occur through [[electrical synapse]]s.{{sfnm|1a1=Bullock|1a2=Orkand|1a3=Grinnell|1y=1977|1pp=178–180|2a1=Schmidt-Nielsen|2y=1997|2pp=490-491}} Due to the direct connection between excitable cells in the form of [[gap junction]]s, an action potential can be transmitted directly from one cell to the next in either direction. The free flow of ions between cells enables rapid non-chemical-mediated transmission. Rectifying channels ensure that action potentials move only in one direction through an electrical synapse.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Electrical synapses are found in all nervous systems, including the human brain, although they are a distinct minority.{{sfn|Purves|Augustine|Fitzpatrick|Hall|2001}}

==="All-or-none" principle===
The [[amplitude]] of an action potential is independent of the amount of current that produced it. In other words, larger currents do not create larger action potentials. Therefore, action potentials are said to be [[All-or-none law|all-or-none]] signals, since either they occur fully or they do not occur at all.&lt;ref name=" Sasaki " group=lower-alpha&gt;Sasaki, T., Matsuki, N., Ikegaya, Y. 2011 Action-potential modulation during axonal conduction Science 331 (6017), pp. 599–601&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aur" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aur | first1 = D. | last2 = Connolly | first2 = C.I. | last3 = Jog | first3 = M.S. | year = 2005 | title = Computing spike directivity with tetrodes | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience Methods | volume = 149 | issue = 1| pages = 57–63 | doi=10.1016/j.jneumeth.2005.05.006| pmid = 15978667 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aur, Jog" group=lower-alpha&gt;Aur D., Jog, MS., 2010 Neuroelectrodynamics: Understanding the brain language, IOS Press, 2010. {{DOI|10.3233/978-1-60750-473-3-i}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to [[receptor potential]]s, whose amplitudes are dependent on the intensity of a stimulus.{{sfn|Purves|Augustine|Fitzpatrick|Hall|2008|pp=26–28}} In both cases, the [[frequency]] of action potentials  is correlated with the intensity of a stimulus.

===Sensory neurons===
{{Main|Sensory neuron}}

In [[sensory neurons]], an external signal such as pressure, temperature, light, or sound is coupled with the opening and closing of [[ion channels]], which in turn alter the ionic permeabilities of the membrane and its voltage.{{sfnm|1a1=Schmidt-Nielsen|1y=1997|1pp=535–580|2a1=Bullock|2a2=Orkand|2a3=Grinnell|2y=1977|2pp=49–56, 76–93, 247–255|3a1=Stevens|3y=1966|3pp=69–79}} These voltage changes can again be excitatory (depolarizing) or inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) and, in some sensory neurons, their combined effects can depolarize the axon hillock enough to provoke action potentials. Some examples in humans include the [[olfactory receptor neuron]] and [[Meissner's corpuscle]], which are critical for the sense of [[olfaction|smell]] and [[somatosensory system|touch]], respectively. However, not all sensory neurons convert their external signals into action potentials; some do not even have an axon!{{sfnm|1a1=Bullock|1a2=Orkand|1a3=Grinnell|1y=1977|1pp=53|2a1=Bullock|2a2=Orkand|2a3=Grinnell|2y=1977|2pp=122–124}} Instead, they may convert the signal into the release of a [[neurotransmitter]], or into continuous [[receptor potential|graded potentials]], either of which may stimulate subsequent neuron(s) into firing an action potential. For illustration, in the human [[ear]], [[hair cell]]s convert the incoming sound into the opening and closing of [[stretch-activated ion channel|mechanically gated ion channels]], which may cause [[neurotransmitter]] molecules to be released. In similar manner, in the human [[retina]], the initial [[photoreceptor cell]]s and the next layer of cells (comprising [[bipolar cell]]s and [[horizontal cell]]s) do not produce action potentials; only some [[amacrine cell]]s and the third layer, the [[Retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cell]]s, produce action potentials, which then travel up the [[optic nerve]].

===Pacemaker potentials===
{{Main|Pacemaker potential}}

[[Image:Pacemaker potential.svg|thumb|right|In [[pacemaker potential]]s, the cell spontaneously depolarizes (straight line with upward slope) until it fires an action potential.|alt=A plot of action potential (mV) vs time. The membrane potential is initially −60 mV, rise relatively slowly to the threshold potential of −40 mV, and then quickly spikes at a potential of +10 mV, after which it rapidly returns to the starting −60 mV potential. The cycle is then repeated.]]

In sensory neurons, action potentials result from an external stimulus. However, some excitable cells require no such stimulus to fire: They spontaneously depolarize their axon hillock and fire action potentials at a regular rate, like an internal clock.{{sfn|Junge|1981|pp=115–132}} The voltage traces of such cells are known as [[pacemaker potential]]s.{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|pp=152–153}}  The [[cardiac pacemaker]] cells of the [[sinoatrial node]] in the [[heart]] provide a good example.&lt;ref name="noble_1960" group=lower-alpha &gt;{{cite journal | author = Noble D | year=1960 | title = Cardiac action and pacemaker potentials based on the Hodgkin-Huxley equations | journal = Nature | volume = 188 | pages = 495–497 | doi = 10.1038/188495b0 | pmid = 13729365|bibcode = 1960Natur.188..495N | issue=4749}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although such pacemaker potentials have a [[neural oscillation|natural rhythm]], it can be adjusted by external stimuli; for instance, [[heart rate]] can be altered by pharmaceuticals as well as signals from the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] nerves.{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|pp=444–445}} The external stimuli do not cause the cell's repetitive firing, but merely alter its timing.{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|pp=152–153}} In some cases, the regulation of frequency can be more complex, leading to patterns of action potentials, such as [[bursting]].

==Phases==
The course of the action potential can be divided into five parts: the rising phase, the peak phase, the falling phase, the undershoot phase, and the refractory period. During the rising phase the membrane potential depolarizes (becomes more positive). The point at which depolarization stops is called the peak phase. At this stage, the membrane potential reaches a maximum. Subsequent to this, there is a falling phase. During this stage the membrane potential becomes more negative, returning towards resting potential. The undershoot, or afterhyperpolarization, phase is the period during which the membrane potential temporarily becomes more negatively charged than when at rest (hyperpolarized). Finally, the time during which a subsequent action potential is impossible or difficult to fire is called the [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]], which may overlap with the other phases.{{sfn|Purves|Augustine|Fitzpatrick|Hall|2008|p=38}}

The course of the action potential is determined by two coupled effects.{{sfn|Stevens|1966|pp=127–128}} First, voltage-sensitive ion channels open and close in response to changes in the [[membrane potential|membrane voltage]] ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''. This changes the membrane's permeability to those ions.{{sfn|Purves|Augustine|Fitzpatrick|Hall|2008|pp=61–65}}  Second, according to the [[Goldman equation]], this change in permeability changes the equilibrium potential ''E&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', and, thus, the membrane voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref name="goldman_1943" group=lower-alpha /&gt;  Thus, the membrane potential affects the permeability, which then further affects the membrane potential. This sets up the possibility for [[positive feedback]], which is a key part of the rising phase of the action potential.{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|pp=150–151}}{{sfnm|1a1=Purves|1a2=Augustine|1a3=Fitzpatrick|1a4=Hall|1y=2008|1pp=48–49|2a1=Bullock|2a2=Orkand|2a3=Grinnell|2y=1977|2p=141|3a1=Schmidt-Nielsen|3y=1997|3p=483|4a1=Junge|4y=1981|4p=89}} A complicating factor is that a single ion channel may have multiple internal "gates" that respond to changes in ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' in opposite ways, or at different rates.{{sfnm|1a1=Purves|1a2=Augustine|1a3=Fitzpatrick|1a4=Hall|1y=2008|1pp=64–74|2a1=Bullock|2a2=Orkand|2a3=Grinnell|2y=1977|2pp=149–150|3a1=Junge|3y=1981|3pp=84–85|4a1=Stevens|4y=1966|4pp=152–158}}&lt;ref name="hodgkin_1952" group=lower-alpha /&gt;  For example, although raising ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''  ''opens'' most gates in the voltage-sensitive sodium channel, it also ''closes'' the channel's "inactivation gate", albeit more slowly.{{sfnm|1a1=Purves|1a2=Augustine|1a3=Fitzpatrick|1a4=Hall|1y=2008|1p=47|2a1=Purves|2a2=Augustine|2a3=Fitzpatrick|2a4=Hall|2y=2008|2p=65|3a1=Bullock|3a2=Orkand|3a3=Grinnell|3y=1977|3pp=147–148|4a1=Stevens|4y=1966|4p=128}} Hence, when ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is raised suddenly, the sodium channels open initially, but then close due to the slower inactivation.

The voltages and currents of the action potential in all of its phases were modeled accurately by [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] in 1952,&lt;ref name="hodgkin_1952" group=lower-alpha /&gt; for which they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="Nobel_1963" group=lower-greek&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1963/index.html | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1963 | publisher = The Royal Swedish Academy of Science | year = 1963 | accessdate = 2010-02-21 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070716195411/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1963/index.html | archivedate = 16 July 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Hodgkin–Huxley model|their model]] considers only two types of voltage-sensitive ion channels, and makes several assumptions about them, e.g., that their internal gates open and close independently of one another.

===Stimulation and rising phase===
A typical action potential begins at the [[axon hillock]]{{sfn|Stevens|1966|p=49}} with a sufficiently strong depolarization, e.g., a stimulus that increases ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''. This depolarization is often caused by the injection of extra sodium [[cation]]s  into the cell; these cations can come from a wide variety of sources, such as [[chemical synapse]]s, [[sensory neuron]]s or [[pacemaker potential]]s.

For a neuron at rest, there is a high concentration of sodium and chloride ions in the [[extracellular fluid]] compared to the [[intracellular fluid]] while there is a high concentration of potassium ions in the intracellular fluid compared to the extracellular fluid. This concentration gradient along with [[potassium leak channel]]s present on the membrane of the neuron causes an [[wikt:Special:Search/efflux|efflux]] of potassium ions making the resting potential close to ''E''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;–75&amp;nbsp;mV.{{sfnm|1a1=Purves|1a2=Augustine|1a3=Fitzpatrick|1a4=Hall|1y=2008|1p=34|2a1=Bullock|2a2=Orkand|2a3=Grinnell|2y=1977|2p=134|3a1=Schmidt-Nielsen|3y=1997|3pp=478–480}} The depolarization opens both the sodium and potassium channels in the membrane, allowing the ions to flow into and out of the axon, respectively.  If the depolarization is small (say, increasing ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' from −70&amp;nbsp;mV to −60&amp;nbsp;mV), the outward potassium current overwhelms the inward sodium current and the membrane repolarizes back to its normal resting potential around −70&amp;nbsp;mV.{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|pp=150–151}}{{sfn|Junge|1981|pp=89–90}}{{sfn|Schmidt-Nielsen|1997|p=484}} However, if the depolarization is large enough, the inward sodium current increases more than the outward potassium current and a runaway condition ([[positive feedback]]) results: the more inward current there is, the more ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' increases, which in turn further increases the inward current.{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|pp=150–151}}{{sfnm|1a1=Purves|1a2=Augustine|1a3=Fitzpatrick|1a4=Hall|1y=2008|1pp=48–49|2a1=Bullock|2a2=Orkand|2a3=Grinnell|2y=1977|2p=141|3a1=Schmidt-Nielsen|3y=1997|3p=483|4a1=Junge|4y=1981|4p=89}} A sufficiently strong depolarization (increase in ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') causes the voltage-sensitive sodium channels to open; the increasing permeability to sodium drives ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' closer to the sodium equilibrium voltage ''E''&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;≈ +55&amp;nbsp;mV.  The increasing voltage in turn causes even more sodium channels to open, which pushes ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' still further towards ''E''&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;.  This positive feedback continues until the  sodium channels are fully open and ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is close to ''E''&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|pp=150–151}}{{sfn|Junge|1981|pp=89–90}}{{sfnm|1a1=Purves|1a2=Augustine|1a3=Fitzpatrick|1a4=Hall|1y=2008|1pp=49–50|2a1=Bullock|2a2=Orkand|2a3=Grinnell|2y=1977|2pp=140–141|3a1=Schmidt-Nielsen|3y=1997|3pp=480–481}}{{sfn|Schmidt-Nielsen|1997|pp=483–484}} The sharp rise in ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' and sodium permeability correspond to the ''rising phase'' of the action potential.{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|pp=150–151}}{{sfn|Junge|1981|pp=89–90}}{{sfnm|1a1=Purves|1a2=Augustine|1a3=Fitzpatrick|1a4=Hall|1y=2008|1pp=49–50|2a1=Bullock|2a2=Orkand|2a3=Grinnell|2y=1977|2pp=140–141|3a1=Schmidt-Nielsen|3y=1997|3pp=480–481}}{{sfn|Schmidt-Nielsen|1997|pp=483–484}}

The critical threshold voltage for this runaway condition is usually around −45&amp;nbsp;mV, but it depends on the recent activity of the axon. A membrane that has just fired an action potential cannot fire another one immediately, since the ion channels have not returned to the deactivated state. The period during which no new action potential can be fired is called the ''absolute refractory period''.{{sfn|Purves|Augustine|Fitzpatrick|Hall|2008|p=49}}{{sfn|Stevens|1966|pp=19–20}}{{sfnm|1a1=Bullock|1a2=Orkand|1a3=Grinnell|1y=1977|1p=151|2a1=Junge|2y=1981|2pp=4–5}} At longer times, after some but not all of the ion channels have recovered, the axon can be stimulated to produce another action potential, but with a higher threshold, requiring a much stronger depolarization, e.g., to −30&amp;nbsp;mV. The period during which action potentials are unusually difficult to evoke is called the ''relative refractory period''.{{sfn|Purves|Augustine|Fitzpatrick|Hall|2008|p=49}}{{sfn|Stevens|1966|pp=19–20}}{{sfnm|1a1=Bullock|1a2=Orkand|1a3=Grinnell|1y=1977|1p=151|2a1=Junge|2y=1981|2pp=4–5}}

===Peak and falling phase===
The positive feedback of the rising phase slows and comes to a halt as the sodium ion channels become maximally open. At the peak of the action potential, the sodium permeability is maximized and the membrane voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is nearly equal to the sodium equilibrium voltage ''E''&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;. However, the same raised voltage that opened the sodium channels initially also slowly shuts them off, by closing their pores; the sodium channels become ''inactivated''.{{sfnm|1a1=Purves|1a2=Augustine|1a3=Fitzpatrick|1a4=Hall|1y=2008|1p=47|2a1=Purves|2a2=Augustine|2a3=Fitzpatrick|2a4=Hall|2y=2008|2p=65|3a1=Bullock|3a2=Orkand|3a3=Grinnell|3y=1977|3pp=147–148|4a1=Stevens|4y=1966|4p=128}} This lowers the membrane's permeability to sodium relative to potassium, driving the membrane voltage back towards the resting value. At the same time, the raised voltage opens voltage-sensitive potassium channels; the increase in the membrane's potassium permeability drives ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' towards ''E''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfnm|1a1=Purves|1a2=Augustine|1a3=Fitzpatrick|1a4=Hall|1y=2008|1p=47|2a1=Purves|2a2=Augustine|2a3=Fitzpatrick|2a4=Hall|2y=2008|2p=65|3a1=Bullock|3a2=Orkand|3a3=Grinnell|3y=1977|3pp=147–148|4a1=Stevens|4y=1966|4p=128}} Combined, these changes in sodium and potassium permeability cause ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' to drop quickly, repolarizing the membrane and producing the "falling phase" of the action potential.{{sfn|Purves|Augustine|Fitzpatrick|Hall|2008|p=49}}{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|p=152}}{{sfn|Schmidt-Nielsen|1997|pp=483–484}}{{sfnm|1a1=Bullock|1a2=Orkand|1a3=Grinnell|1y=1977|1pp=147–149|2a1=Stevens|2y=1966|2pp=126–127}}

===&lt;!--"Afterhyperpolarization" is a single word; please do not divide it into two words!--&gt;Afterhyperpolarization===
The raised voltage opened many more potassium channels than usual, and some of these do not close right away when the membrane returns to its normal resting voltage. In addition, [[SK channel|further potassium channels]] open in response to the influx of calcium ions during the action potential. The potassium permeability of the membrane is transiently unusually high, driving the membrane voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' even closer to the potassium equilibrium voltage ''E''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;. Hence, there is an undershoot or [[hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]], termed an [[afterhyperpolarization]] in technical language, that persists until the membrane potassium permeability returns to its usual value.{{sfn|Purves|Augustine|Fitzpatrick|Hall|2008|p=37}}{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|p=152}}

===Refractory period===
Each action potential is followed by a [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]], which can be divided into an ''absolute refractory period'', during which it is impossible to evoke another action potential, and then a ''relative refractory period'', during which a stronger-than-usual stimulus is required.{{sfn|Purves|Augustine|Fitzpatrick|Hall|2008|p=49}}{{sfn|Stevens|1966|pp=19–20}}{{sfnm|1a1=Bullock|1a2=Orkand|1a3=Grinnell|1y=1977|1p=151|2a1=Junge|2y=1981|2pp=4–5}} These two refractory periods are caused by changes in the state of sodium and potassium channel molecules. When closing after an action potential, sodium channels enter an [[Sodium channel#Gating|"inactivated" state]], in which they cannot be made to open regardless of the membrane potential—this gives rise to the absolute refractory period. Even after a sufficient number of sodium channels have transitioned back to their resting state, it frequently happens that a fraction of potassium channels remains open, making it difficult for the membrane potential to depolarize, and thereby giving rise to the relative refractory period. Because the density and subtypes of potassium channels may differ greatly between different types of neurons, the duration of the relative refractory period is highly variable.

The absolute refractory period is largely responsible for the unidirectional propagation of action potentials along axons.{{sfn|Purves|Augustine|Fitzpatrick|Hall|2008|p=56}} At any given moment, the patch of axon behind the actively spiking part is refractory, but the patch in front, not having been activated recently, is capable of being stimulated by the depolarization from the action potential.

==Propagation==
{{Main|Nerve conduction velocity}} &lt;!-- note: factually not a main article, but a stub in need of expansion; perhaps the material below should simply be moved there and a summary left in its place --&gt;

The action potential generated at the axon hillock propagates as a wave along the axon.{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|pp=160–164}} The currents flowing inwards at a point on the axon during an action potential spread out along the axon, and depolarize the adjacent sections of its membrane. If sufficiently strong, this depolarization provokes a similar action potential at the neighboring membrane patches. This basic mechanism was demonstrated by [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] in 1937. After crushing or cooling nerve segments and thus blocking the action potentials, he showed that an action potential arriving on one side of the block could provoke another action potential on the other, provided that the blocked segment was sufficiently short.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin AL]] | year = 1937 | title = Evidence for electrical transmission in nerve, Part I | journal = Journal of Physiology | volume = 90 | pages = 183–210 | pmid = 16994885 | issue = 2 | pmc = 1395060}}&lt;br /&gt;* {{cite journal | author = [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin AL]] | year = 1937 | title = Evidence for electrical transmission in nerve, Part II | journal = Journal of Physiology | volume = 90 | pages = 211–32 | pmid = 16994886 | issue = 2 | pmc = 1395062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an action potential has occurred at a patch of membrane, the membrane patch needs time to recover before it can fire again. At the molecular level, this ''absolute refractory period'' corresponds to the time required for the voltage-activated sodium channels to recover from inactivation, i.e., to return to their closed state.{{sfn|Stevens|1966|pp=19–20}} There are many types of voltage-activated potassium channels in neurons. Some of them inactivate fast (A-type currents) and some of them inactivate slowly or not inactivate at all; this variability guarantees that there will be always an available source of current for repolarization, even if some of the potassium channels are inactivated because of preceding depolarization. On the other hand, all neuronal voltage-activated sodium channels inactivate within several milliseconds during strong depolarization, thus making following depolarization impossible until a substantial fraction of sodium channels have returned to their closed state. Although it limits the frequency of firing,{{sfn|Stevens|1966|pp=21–23}} the absolute refractory period ensures that the action potential moves in only one direction along an axon.{{sfn|Purves|Augustine|Fitzpatrick|Hall|2008|p=56}}  The currents flowing in due to an action potential spread out in both directions along the axon.{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|pp=161–164}} However, only the unfired part of the axon can respond with an action potential; the part that has just fired is unresponsive until the action potential is safely out of range and cannot restimulate that part. In the usual [[orthodromic conduction]], the action potential propagates from the axon hillock towards the synaptic knobs (the axonal termini); propagation in the opposite direction—known as [[antidromic conduction]]—is very rare.{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|p=509}}  However, if a laboratory axon is stimulated in its middle, both halves of the axon are "fresh", i.e., unfired; then two action potentials will be generated, one traveling towards the axon hillock and the other traveling towards the synaptic knobs.

===Myelin and saltatory conduction===
{{Main|Myelination|Saltatory conduction}}
[[Image:Neuron1.jpg|thumb|In [[saltatory conduction]], an action potential at one [[node of Ranvier]] causes inwards currents that depolarize the membrane at the next node, provoking a new action potential there; the action potential appears to "hop" from node to node.|alt=Axons of neurons are wrapped by several myelin sheaths, which shield the axon from extracellular fluid. There are short gaps between the myelin sheaths known as ''nodes of Ranvier'' where the axon is directly exposed to the surrounding extracellular fluid.]]
In order to enable fast and efficient transduction of electrical signals in the nervous system, certain neuronal axons are covered with [[myelin]] sheaths. Myelin is a multilamellar membrane that enwraps the axon in segments separated by intervals known as [[nodes of Ranvier]]. It is produced by specialized cells: [[Schwann cell]]s exclusively in the [[peripheral nervous system]], and [[oligodendrocyte]]s exclusively in the [[central nervous system]]. Myelin sheath reduces membrane capacitance and increases membrane resistance in the inter-node intervals, thus allowing a fast, saltatory movement of action potentials from node to node.&lt;ref name=Zalc group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zalc B |title=The acquisition of myelin: a success story |journal=Novartis Found.

Myelin prevents ions from entering or leaving the axon along myelinated segments. As a general rule, myelination increases the [[conduction velocity]] of action potentials and makes them more energy-efficient. Whether saltatory or not, the mean conduction velocity of an action potential ranges from 1&amp;nbsp;[[Metre per second|meter per second]] (m/s) to over 100&amp;nbsp;m/s, and, in general, increases with axonal diameter.&lt;ref name="hursh_1939" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hursh JB | year = 1939 | title = Conduction velocity and diameter of nerve fibers | journal = American Journal of Physiology | volume = 127 | pages = 131–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Action potentials cannot propagate through the membrane in myelinated segments of the axon. However, the current is carried by the cytoplasm, which is sufficient to depolarize the first or second subsequent [[node of Ranvier]]. Instead, the ionic current from an action potential at one [[node of Ranvier]] provokes another action potential at the next node; this apparent "hopping" of the action potential from node to node is known as [[saltatory conduction]].

Myelin has two important advantages: fast conduction speed and energy efficiency. For axons larger than a minimum diameter (roughly 1 [[micrometre]]), myelination increases the [[conduction velocity]] of an action potential, typically tenfold.&lt;ref name="hartline_2007" group=lower-alpha /&gt; Conversely, for a given conduction velocity, myelinated fibers are smaller than their unmyelinated counterparts. For example, action potentials move at roughly the same speed (25&amp;nbsp;m/s) in a myelinated frog axon and an unmyelinated [[squid giant axon]], but the frog axon has a roughly 30-fold smaller diameter and 1000-fold smaller cross-sectional area. Also, since the ionic currents are confined to the nodes of Ranvier, far fewer ions "leak" across the membrane, saving metabolic energy. This saving is a significant [[natural selection|selective advantage]], since the human nervous system uses approximately 20% of the body's metabolic energy.&lt;ref name="hartline_2007" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hartline DK, Colman DR |title=Rapid conduction and the evolution of giant axons and myelinated fibers |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=R29–R35 |year=2007 |pmid=17208176 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.11.042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of axons' myelinated segments is important to the success of saltatory conduction. They should be as long as possible to maximize the speed of conduction, but not so long that the arriving signal is too weak to provoke an action potential at the next node of Ranvier. In nature, myelinated segments are generally long enough for the passively propagated signal to travel for at least two nodes while retaining enough amplitude to fire an action potential at the second or third node. Thus, the [[safety factor]] of saltatory conduction is high, allowing transmission to bypass nodes in case of injury. However, action potentials may end prematurely in certain places where the safety factor is low, even in unmyelinated neurons; a common example is the branch point of an axon, where it divides into two axons.{{sfn|Bullock|Orkand|Grinnell|1977|p=163}}

Some diseases degrade myelin and impair saltatory conduction, reducing the conduction velocity of action potentials.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller RH, Mi S |title=Dissecting demyelination |journal=Nat.

===Cable theory===
{{Main|Cable theory}}
[[File:Cable theory Neuron RC circuit v3.svg|alt=A diagram showing the resistance and capacitance across the cell membrane of an axon. The cell membrane is divided into adjacent regions, each having its own resistance and capacitance between the cytosol and extracellular fluid across the membrane. Each of these regions is in turn connected by an intracellular circuit with a resistance.|thumb|300x300px|Cable theory's simplified view of a neuronal fiber. The connected [[RC circuit]]s correspond to adjacent segments of a passive [[neurite]]. The extracellular resistances ''r&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' (the counterparts of the intracellular resistances ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') are not shown, since they are usually negligibly small; the extracellular medium may be assumed to have the same voltage everywhere.]]
The flow of currents within an axon can be described quantitatively by [[cable theory]]&lt;ref name="rall_1989"&gt;[[Wilfrid Rall|Rall, W]] in {{harvnb|Koch|Segev|1989|loc=''Cable Theory for Dendritic Neurons'', pp. 9–62.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its elaborations, such as the compartmental model.&lt;ref name="segev_1989"&gt;Segev, I; Fleshman, JW; Burke, RE in {{harvnb|Koch|Segev|1989|loc=''Compartmental Models of Complex Neurons'', pp. 63–96.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable theory was developed in 1855 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] to model the transatlantic telegraph cable&lt;ref name="kelvin_1855" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin WT]] | year = 1855 | title = On the theory of the electric telegraph | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society | volume = 7 | pages = 382–99 | doi = 10.1098/rspl.1854.0093}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was shown to be relevant to neurons by [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]] and [[W. A. H. Rushton|Rushton]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="hodgkin_1946" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1946 | title = The electrical constants of a crustacean nerve fibre | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume =  133| pages = 444–79 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.1946.0024 | pmid=20281590 |bibcode = 1946RSPSB.133..444H | issue=873 | name-list-format=vanc |author1 = Hodgkin AL|authorlink1 = Alan Lloyd Hodgkin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In simple cable theory, the neuron is treated as an electrically passive, perfectly cylindrical transmission cable, which can be described by a [[partial differential equation]]&lt;ref name="rall_1989" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} = \lambda^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x^2} - V
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V''(''x'', ''t'') is the voltage across the membrane at a time ''t'' and a position ''x'' along the length of the neuron, and where λ and τ are the characteristic length and time scales on which those voltages decay in response to a stimulus. Referring to the circuit diagram on the right, these scales can be determined from the resistances and capacitances per unit length.{{sfn|Purves|Augustine|Fitzpatrick|Hall|2008|pp=52–53}}

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau =\ r_m c_m \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda = \sqrt \frac{r_m}{r_\ell}
&lt;/math&gt;

These time and length-scales can be used to understand the dependence of the conduction velocity on the diameter of the neuron in unmyelinated fibers. For example, the time-scale τ increases with both the membrane resistance ''r&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' and capacitance ''c&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''.  As the capacitance increases, more charge must be transferred to produce a given transmembrane voltage (by [[capacitance|the equation ''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''CV'']]); as the resistance increases, less charge is transferred per unit time, making the equilibration slower.  In a similar manner, if the internal resistance per unit length ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is lower in one axon than in another (e.g., because the radius of the former is larger), the spatial decay length λ becomes longer and the [[conduction velocity]] of an action potential should increase. If the transmembrane resistance ''r&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is increased, that lowers the average "leakage" current across the membrane, likewise causing ''λ'' to become longer, increasing the conduction velocity.

===Muscular action potentials===
{{Main|Neuromuscular junction|Muscle contraction}}

The action potential in a normal skeletal muscle cell is similar to the action potential in neurons.{{sfn|Ganong|1991|pp=59–60}} Action potentials result from the depolarization of the cell membrane (the [[sarcolemma]]), which opens voltage-sensitive sodium channels; these become inactivated and the membrane is repolarized through the outward current of potassium ions. The resting potential prior to the action potential is typically −90mV, somewhat more negative than typical neurons. The muscle action potential lasts roughly 2–4&amp;nbsp;ms, the absolute refractory period is roughly 1–3&amp;nbsp;ms, and the conduction velocity along the muscle is roughly 5&amp;nbsp;m/s.  The action potential releases [[calcium]] ions that free up the [[tropomyosin]] and allow the muscle to contract. Muscle action potentials are provoked by the arrival of a pre-synaptic neuronal action potential at the [[neuromuscular junction]], which is a common target for [[neurotoxin]]s.&lt;ref name=Newmark group=lower-alpha /&gt;

==Taxonomic distribution and evolutionary advantages==
Action potentials are found throughout [[multicellular organism]]s, including [[plant]]s, [[invertebrate]]s such as [[insect]]s, and [[vertebrate]]s such as [[reptile]]s and [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref name=Fromm group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fromm J, Lautner S |title=Electrical signals and their physiological significance in plants |journal=Plant Cell Environ. |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=249–257 |year=2007 |pmid=17263772 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01614.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sponge]]s seem to be the main [[phylum]] of multicellular [[eukaryote]]s that does not transmit action potentials, although some studies have suggested that these organisms have a form of electrical signaling, too.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leys SP, Mackie GO, Meech RW |title=Impulse conduction in a sponge |journal=J.

Given its conservation throughout evolution, the action potential seems to confer evolutionary advantages. One function of action potentials is rapid, long-range signaling within the organism; the conduction velocity can exceed 110&amp;nbsp;m/s, which is one-third the [[speed of sound]]. For comparison, a hormone molecule carried in the bloodstream moves at roughly 8&amp;nbsp;m/s in large arteries. Part of this function is the tight coordination of mechanical events, such as the contraction of the heart. A second function is the computation associated with its generation. Being an all-or-none signal that does not decay with transmission distance, the action potential has similar advantages to [[digital electronics]]. The integration of various dendritic signals at the axon hillock and its thresholding to form a complex train of action potentials is another form of computation, one that has been exploited biologically to form [[central pattern generator]]s and mimicked in [[artificial neural network]]s.

[[Image:Loligo forbesii.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Giant axons of the longfin inshore squid (''[[Doryteuthis pealeii]]'') were [[Marine Biological Laboratory#Neuroscience, neurobiology, and sensory physiology|crucial for scientists]] to understand the action potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDi2BQAAQBAJ |title=The Brain, the Nervous System, and Their Diseases |first=Jennifer L. |last=Hellier |year=2014 |page=532 |publisher=ABC-Clio |isbn=9781610693387}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=Illustration of the longfin inshore squid.]]

The study of action potentials has required the development of new experimental methods. The initial work, prior to 1955, was carried out primarily by [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Fielding Huxley]], who were, along [[John Carew Eccles]], awarded the 1963 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their contribution to the description of the ionic basis of nerve conduction. It focused on three goals: isolating signals from single neurons or axons, developing fast, sensitive electronics, and shrinking [[electrode]]s enough that the voltage inside a single cell could be recorded.

The first problem was solved by studying the giant axons found in the neurons of the [[squid]] (''[[Loligo forbesii]]'' and ''[[Doryteuthis pealeii]]'', at the time classified as ''Loligo pealeii'').&lt;ref name="keynes_1989" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal | author = Keynes RD | year = 1989 | title = The role of giant axons in studies of the nerve impulse | journal = BioEssays | volume = 10 | pages = 90–93|pmid=2541698  | doi = 10.1002/bies.950100213 | issue = 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These axons are so large in diameter (roughly 1&amp;nbsp;mm, or 100-fold larger than a typical neuron) that they can be seen with the naked eye, making them easy to extract and manipulate.&lt;ref name="hodgkin_1952" group=lower-alpha /&gt;&lt;ref name=Meunier group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meunier C, Segev I |title=Playing the devil's advocate: is the Hodgkin-Huxley model useful? |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=558–63 |year=2002 |pmid=12392930 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(02)02278-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they are not representative of all excitable cells, and numerous other systems with action potentials have been studied.

The second problem was addressed with the crucial development of the [[voltage clamp]],&lt;ref name="cole_1949" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Kenneth Stewart Cole|Cole KS]] | year = 1949 | title = Dynamic electrical characteristics of the squid axon membrane | journal = Arch. Sci. Physiol. | volume = 3 | pages = 253–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which permitted experimenters to study the ionic currents underlying an action potential in isolation, and eliminated a key source of [[electronic noise]], the current ''I&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' associated with the [[capacitance]] ''C'' of the membrane.{{sfn|Junge|1981|pp=63–82}} Since the current equals ''C'' times the rate of change of the transmembrane voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', the solution was to design a circuit that kept ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' fixed (zero rate of change) regardless of the currents flowing across the membrane. Thus, the current required to keep ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' at a fixed value is a direct reflection of the current flowing through the membrane. Other electronic advances included the use of [[Faraday cage]]s and electronics with high [[input impedance]], so that the measurement itself did not affect the voltage being measured.{{sfn|Kettenmann|Grantyn|1992}}

The third problem, that of obtaining electrodes small enough to record voltages within a single axon without perturbing it, was solved in 1949 with the invention of the glass micropipette electrode,&lt;ref name="ling_1949" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ling G, Gerard RW | year = 1949 | title = The normal membrane potential of frog sartorius fibers | journal = J.

[[Image:Single channel.png|thumb|left|As revealed by a [[patch clamp]] electrode, an [[ion channel]] has two states: open (high conductance) and closed (low conductance).|alt=Plot of membrane potential versus time. The channel is primarily in a high conductance state punctuated by random and relatively brief transitions to a low conductance states ]]

While glass micropipette electrodes measure the sum of the currents passing through many ion channels, studying the electrical properties of a single ion channel became possible in the 1970s with the development of the [[patch clamp]] by [[Erwin Neher]] and [[Bert Sakmann]]. For this discovery, they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="Nobel_1991" group=lower-greek&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1991/press.html | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1991 | publisher = The Royal Swedish Academy of Science | year = 1991 | accessdate = 2010-02-21 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100324031907/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1991/press.html | archivedate = 24 March 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patch-clamping verified that ionic channels have discrete states of conductance, such as open, closed and inactivated.

[[Optical imaging]] technologies have been developed in recent years to measure action potentials, either via simultaneous multisite recordings or with ultra-spatial resolution. Using [[Potentiometric dyes|voltage-sensitive dyes]], action potentials have been optically recorded from a tiny patch of [[cardiomyocyte]] membrane.&lt;ref name="pmid19289075" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bu G, Adams H, Berbari EJ, Rubart M | title = Uniform action potential repolarization within the sarcolemma of in situ ventricular cardiomyocytes | journal = Biophys.

==Neurotoxins==
[[Image:Puffer Fish DSC01257.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tetrodotoxin]] is a lethal toxin found in [[pufferfish]] that inhibits the [[voltage-gated ion channel|voltage-sensitive sodium channel]], halting action potentials.|alt=Photograph of a pufferfish.]]

Several [[neurotoxin]]s, both natural and synthetic, are designed to block the action potential.  [[Tetrodotoxin]] from the [[pufferfish]] and [[saxitoxin]] from the ''[[Gonyaulax]]'' (the [[dinoflagellate]] genus responsible for "[[Paralytic shellfish poisoning|red tide]]s")  block action potentials by inhibiting the voltage-sensitive sodium channel;&lt;ref name="TTX_refs" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nakamura Y, Nakajima S, Grundfest H | year = 1965 | title = The effect of tetrodotoxin on electrogenic components of squid giant axons | journal = J.

Such inhibitors of ion channels serve an important research purpose, by allowing scientists to "turn off" specific channels at will, thus isolating  the other channels' contributions; they can also be useful in purifying ion channels by [[affinity chromatography]] or in assaying their concentration. However, such inhibitors also make effective neurotoxins, and have been considered for use as [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapon]]s.  Neurotoxins aimed at the ion channels of insects have been effective [[insecticide]]s; one example is the synthetic [[permethrin]], which prolongs the activation of the sodium channels involved in action potentials.  The ion channels of insects are sufficiently different from their human counterparts that there are few side effects in humans.

The role of electricity in the nervous systems of animals was first observed in dissected [[frog]]s by [[Luigi Galvani]], who studied it from 1791 to 1797.&lt;ref name="piccolino_1997" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal | author = Piccolino M | year = 1997 | title = Luigi Galvani and animal electricity: two centuries after the foundation of electrophysiology | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 20 | pages = 443–448 | doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(97)01101-6 | issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galvani's results stimulated [[Alessandro Volta]] to develop the [[Voltaic pile]]—the earliest-known [[battery (electricity)|electric battery]]—with which he studied animal electricity (such as [[electric eel]]s) and the physiological responses to applied [[direct current|direct-current]] [[voltage]]s.&lt;ref name="piccolino_2000" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal | author = Piccolino M | year = 2000 | title = The bicentennial of the Voltaic battery (1800–2000): the artificial electric organ | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 23 | pages = 147–151 | doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(99)01544-1 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists of the 19th century studied the propagation of electrical signals in whole [[nerve]]s (i.e., bundles of [[neuron]]s) and demonstrated that nervous tissue was made up of [[cell (biology)|cells]], instead of an interconnected network of tubes (a ''reticulum'').{{sfnm|1a1=Brazier|1y=1961|2a1=McHenry|2a2=Garrison|2y=1969|3a1=Worden|3a2=Swazey|3a3=Adelman|3y=1975}}  [[Carlo Matteucci]] followed up Galvani's studies and demonstrated that [[cell membrane]]s had a voltage across them and could produce [[direct current]]. Matteucci's work inspired the German physiologist, [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]], who discovered the action potential in 1843.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The [[conduction velocity]] of action potentials was first measured in 1850 by du Bois-Reymond's friend, [[Hermann von Helmholtz]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} To establish that nervous tissue is made up of discrete cells, the Spanish physician [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] and his students used a stain developed by [[Camillo Golgi]] to reveal the myriad shapes of neurons, which they rendered painstakingly.  For their discoveries, Golgi and Ramón y Cajal were awarded the 1906 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Physiology]].&lt;ref name="Nobel_1906" group=lower-greek&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1906/index.html | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1906 | publisher = The Royal Swedish Academy of Science | year = 1906 | accessdate = 2010-02-21 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081204190959/http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1906/index.html | archivedate = 4 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work resolved a long-standing controversy in the [[neuroanatomy]] of the 19th century; Golgi himself had argued for the network model of the nervous system.

The 20th century was a significant era for electrophysiology. In 1902 and again in 1912, [[Julius Bernstein]] advanced the hypothesis that the action potential resulted from a change in the [[permeation|permeability]] of the axonal membrane to ions.&lt;ref name="bernstein_1902_1912" group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Julius Bernstein|Bernstein J]] | year = 1902 | title = Untersuchungen zur Thermodynamik der bioelektrischen Ströme | journal = Pflüger's Archiv für die gesamte Physiologie | volume = 92 | pages = 521–562 | doi = 10.1007/BF01790181 | issue = 10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bernstein|1912}} Bernstein's hypothesis was confirmed by [[Kenneth Stewart Cole|Ken Cole]] and Howard Curtis, who showed that membrane conductance increases during an action potential.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1939 | title = Electrical impedance of the squid giant axon during activity | journal = J.

The ''C&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the capacitance of the membrane patch, whereas the four ''g'''s represent the [[electrical conductance|conductances]] of four types of ions. The two conductances on the left, for potassium (K) and sodium (Na), are shown with arrows to indicate that they can vary with the applied voltage, corresponding to the [[voltage-gated ion channel|voltage-sensitive ion channels]]. The two conductances on the right help determine the [[resting membrane potential]].|alt=Circuit diagram depicting five parallel circuits that are interconnected at the top to the extracellular solution and at the bottom to the intracellular solution.]]

Mathematical and computational models are essential for understanding the action potential, and offer predictions  that may be tested against experimental data, providing a stringent test of a theory.  The most important and accurate of the early neural models is the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]], which describes the action potential by a coupled set of four [[ordinary differential equation]]s (ODEs).&lt;ref name="hodgkin_1952" group=lower-alpha /&gt; Although the Hodgkin–Huxley model may be a simplification with few limitations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Sodium Currents Activate without a Hodgkin and Huxley-Type Delay in Central Mammalian Neurons |year= 2006 |last1= Baranauskas |first1=G. |journal=J.

==United States Relations==
On April 24, 1975, Dramé delivered a letter from the president of Guinea, [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]], to [[Gerald Ford]] addressing Guinea's food shortage and requesting assistance from the United States.&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guinea, Republic of - President Ahmed Sekou Toure|url=https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0351/1555812.pdf|website=fordmuseumlibrary.gov|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1976 signing of [[PL 480]] by the American government, Dramé returned to the United States on April 27, 1976 with a letter from the Guinean president to start the agreement between the Guinean and United States governments. During this agreement, Dramé led a team of Guinean representatives to negotiate the Title I and Title II food provided by PL 480.&lt;ref name="ford" /&gt;

==Arrest==
Dramé was Minister of Planning when he was arrested on the night of 18/19 July 1976 and imprisoned at [[Camp Boiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Early life==
Johann Salvator was born in [[Florence]], the youngest son of [[Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] and his second wife, [[Princess Maria Antonia of the Two Sicilies]]. He was baptized in Florence's [[Florence Baptistery|Battistero di San Giovanni]] as ''Giovanni Nepomuceno Maria Annunziata Giuseppe Giovanni Batista Ferdinando Baldassare Luigi Gonzaga Pietro Alessandrino Zanobi Antonino''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivio.operaduomo.fi.it/imgbattesimi/B0033/R175_P145.jpg |title=Photography of baptismal register on 1852, 26th November. |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He pursued a career in the [[Austrian Army]] and was a good friend of [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria]], with both sharing liberal opinions.&lt;ref name=Fanthorpe&gt;{{cite book |last=Fanthorpe |first=Lionel |author2=Patricia Fanthorpe |title=Unsolved Mysteries of the Sea |year=2004 |publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd |isbn=1-55002-498-1 |pages=161–162 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bulgaria was granted autonomy by the [[Ottoman Empire]], Johann Salvator was an unsuccessful candidate for the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barkeley |first=Richard |title= The Road to Mayerling: Life and Death of Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria  |year=1959 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |page=158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Prince Alexander of Battenberg]] would be elected Prince of Bulgaria in 1879. During the [[Austro-Hungarian]] occupation of the Ottoman territory of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1878, he was put in command of a division of the occupying army and won numerous honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Europe's Latest Treaty | publisher =New York Times | page = 1 | date =24 July 1878}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Orth Officially Dead | publisher =New York Times | page = 1 | date =28 May 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 October 1889, he resigned his army commission and renounced his title and the privileges he enjoyed as a member of the Austrian Imperial Family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1891 |title=[[Almanach de Gotha]] |publisher=[[Justus Perthes]] |page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After renouncing his titles he assumed the name "Johann (or John) Orth", the surname Orth derived from the name of a castle he had owned, [[Schloss Orth]].

==Disappearance==
In 1889, Johann Salvator married  Ludmilla ("Milli") Stubel, an [[opera]] [[dancer]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="habsburger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.habsburger.net/en/chapter/johann-orth-habsburg-retd?language=en|title=Johann Orth: Habsburg (ret’d)|publisher=habsburger.net|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his marriage, he purchased a ship named the ''Santa Margareta'', on which he and his wife sailed for [[South America]]. In February 1890 he set off from [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], heading for [[Valparaíso]] in [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Missing Archduke | publisher =New York Times | page = 1 | date =26 December 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was last seen on 12 July in Cape Tres Puntas, [[Argentina]]. It is believed that his ship was lost during a storm off the coast of [[Cape Horn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19110226&amp;id=cKZAAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2808,3206401|title=Will Be Declared Dead|date=26 February 1911|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|page=1|accessdate=28 July 2015|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was officially declared dead on 2 February 1911 in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1126&amp;dat=19110202&amp;id=FwJRAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3443,396021|title=John Orth Declared Dead|date=2 February 1911|work=The Gazette Times|page=1|accessdate=28 July 2015|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gies McGuigan|first=Dorothy |title=The Habsburgs|year=1966|publisher=Doubleday|page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following Salvator's disappearance, numerous sightings of him were reported. Rumors persisted that he and his wife sailed to [[South America]] and assumed new identities.&lt;ref name=Fanthorpe/&gt; Several men also came forward claiming to be the "missing Duke". One of the more publicised claims came in May 1945 when a German born [[lithographer]] living in [[Kristiansand, Norway]] named Alexander Hugo Køhler made a deathbed confession claiming that he was Johann Salvator. Køhler claimed that, as Johann Orth, he "bought" the identity of Alexander Hugo Køhler and assumed his life. Køhler claimed that the real Alexander Hugo Køhler posed as Salvator and it was he who died at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://da2.uib.no/koehler/ |title=Alexander Hugo Köhler - German lithographer or Italian Archduke? |date=April 2008 |publisher=da2.uib.no |language=Norwegian |accessdate=28 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103160245/http://da2.uib.no/koehler/ |archivedate=3 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, relatives of Køhler requested that his grave be opened so that a DNA test could be performed. Should Køhler and Johann Salvator actually be the same person, Køhler's descendants may be entitled to Johann Salvator's heritage, including [[Schloss Orth]].&lt;ref name="arvingerFårÅpneGrav"&gt;{{cite web

'''C57BL/6''', often referred to as "C57 black 6", "C57" or "black 6", is a common [[inbred strain]] of [[laboratory mouse]].

It is the most widely used "genetic background" for genetically modified mice for use as models of human disease. They are the most widely used and best-selling mouse strain, due to the availability of [[congenic]] strains, easy breeding, and robustness.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_mouse_trap/2011/11/black_6_lab_mice_and_the_history_of_biomedical_research.html

|title = The Trouble With Black-6: A tiny alcoholic takes over the lab.
| author = Engber, Daniel
| date = 17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance and behavior ==
C57BL/6 mice have a dark brown, nearly black coat.  They are more sensitive to noise and odours and are more likely to bite than the more docile laboratory strains such as [[BALB/c]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cellmigration.org/resource/komouse/protocols/mouse_management_feb06.pdf|title=Aurora’s Guide to Mouse Colony Management |last=Connor|first=A.B.|year=2006|work=Cell Migration Gateway|publisher=CMC Activity Center |accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are good breeders.&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt;

Group-housed B6 female mice display [[Barber#Animals|barbering]] behavior, in which the dominant mouse in a cage selectively removes hair from its subordinate cage mates. Mice that have been barbered have large bald patches on their bodies, commonly around the head, snout, and shoulders, although barbering may appear anywhere on the body. Both hair and [[whiskers]] may be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sarna |first1=JR |first2=RH |first3=IQ |title=The Dalila effect: C57BL6 mice barber whiskers by plucking |journal=[[Behavioural Brain Research]] |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=39–45 |date=February 2000 |pmid=10680755 |doi= 10.1016/S0166-4328(99)00137-0 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166-4328(99)00137-0 |accessdate=2011-01-16 |last2=Dyck |last3=Whishaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

C57BL/6 has many unusual characteristics that make it useful for some work and inappropriate for other: It is unusually sensitive to pain and to cold, and [[analgesic]] medications are less effective in it.&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most mouse strains, it drinks [[alcoholic beverage]]s voluntarily. It is more susceptible than average to [[morphine addiction]], [[atherosclerosis]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} and age-related [[hearing loss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Behavioral Genetics of the Mouse: Genetics of Behavioral Phenotypes |editor1-last=Crusio| editor1-first=Wim E. |editor1link=Wim Crusio |editor2-last=Sluyter |editor2-first=Frans |editor3-last=Gerlai |editor3-first=Robert T. |editor3-link=Robert Gerlai |editor4-last=Pietropaolo |editor4-first=Susanna |chapter=Audition |last1=Willott |first1=James F. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |series=Cambridge Handbooks in Behavioral Genetics |date=April 2013 |isbn=978-1-107-03481-5  |pages=36–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics ==
The C57BL/6 mouse was the second-ever mammalian species to have its entire genome published.&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt;

The dark coat make the mouse strain convenient for creating transgenic mice: it is crossed with a light-furred 129 mouse, and the desirable crosses can be easily identified by their mixed coat colors.&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt;

There now exist colonies of mice derived from the original C57BL/6 colony that have been bred in isolation from one another for many hundreds of generations. Owing to [[genetic drift]] these colonies differ widely from one another (and, it goes without saying, from the original mice isolated at the [[Bussey Institute]]). Responsible scientists, including those at accredited repositories, are careful to point out this fact and take pains to distinguish sublines such as C57BL/6J (the established subline at [[The Jackson Laboratory]]) from C57BL/6N, etc. But even within these sublines, the potential for drift exists in colonies maintained by individual laboratories who do not have a systematic practice of reestablishing breeders from a centralized, vetted stock.

== Popularity ==
By far the most popular laboratory rodent, the C57BL/6 mouse accounts for half to five-sixths of all rodents shipped to research laboratories from American suppliers.&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt; Its overwhelming popularity is due largely to inertia: it has been widely used and widely studied, and therefore it is used even more.&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt;

In 2013 C57BL/6 mice were flown into space aboard [[Bion-M No.1]].&lt;ref name="spaceweb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/bion_m.html |title=Bion (12KSM) satellite |work=RussianSpaceWeb |first=Anatoly |last=Zak |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 C57BL/6NTac females provided by Taconic Biosciences were sent to the International Space Station on [[SpaceX CRS-6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=LIFTOFF: FALCON 9 AND DRAGON BEGIN CRS-6 MISSION TO RESUPPLY THE SPACE STATION |url=http://www.spacex.com/news/2015/04/14/liftoff-falcon-9-and-dragon-begin-crs-6-mission-resupply-international-space-station |accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The inbred strain of C57BL mice was created in 1921 by [[C. C. Little]] at the [[Bussey Institution|Bussey Institute for Research in Applied Biology]].&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt; The substrain "6" was the most popular of the surviving substrains.

'''Charles Bowdre''' (1848 &amp;ndash; December 23, 1880) was an [[United States|American]] [[List of cowboys and cowgirls|cowboy]] and [[outlaw]]. He was an associate of [[Billy the Kid]] and member of his gang.

==Early life==
Bowdre was born in [[Wilkes County, Georgia]]. When he was three years old, he and his parents moved to [[Mississippi]]. By 1854, young Charlie started working in his father's [[farm]], and as he grew up became an adept farmer. Much of what Bowdre did between the year in which his last sister was born (1863) and 1874, remains a mystery.

It is believed, however, that he abandoned the family's farm to become a wanderer. Records show that by 1874, he had arrived at [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln County]], [[New Mexico]]. Bowdre became friends with [[Doc Scurlock]] during this time, and the two men opened a cheese factory on the [[Gila River]]. He also joined Scurlock on several [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]]s during this period, pursuing cattle thieves and rustlers, on several occasions taking part in the lynching of those captured. On July 18, 1876, Bowdre, Scurlock, [[Frank Coe (Lincoln County War)|Frank Coe]], [[George Coe (Lincoln County War)|George Coe]], and [[Ab Saunders]] stormed the very weak Lincoln jail, freeing cattle rustler Jesus Largo from the custody of [[Sheriff]] Saturnino Baca, taking Largo outside of town and hanging him. No charges were ever filed for the event. On August 5, 1877, he and a companion were arrested for "shooting up" the town of Lincoln while intoxicated.

==Lincoln County War==
With the outbreak of the [[Lincoln County War]] in 1878, Bowdre sided with the Tunstall-McSween side, and he met Billy, [[Jose Chavez y Chavez]] and the rest of the Kid's associates, including [[Richard M. Brewer]] and [[Jim French (cowboy)|Jim French]], [[George Coe (Lincoln County War)|George Coe]] and [[Frank Coe (Lincoln County War)|Frank Coe]]. During the conflict, he was known to have been present with his fellow [[Lincoln County Regulators|Regulators]] when William Morton, Frank Baker, and William McCloskey were killed along the Blackwater Creek on March 9, 1878. Bowdre was shot by [[Buckshot Roberts]] during the [[Gunfight of Blazer's Mills]] on April 4, 1878, and in turn shot Roberts. Bowdre would be charged with killing Buckshot Roberts during the Blazer's Mills Gunfight. He was also present in the July 15–19, 1878 [[Battle of Lincoln, New Mexico|Battle of Lincoln]].

==After the Lincoln County War==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
Bowdre worked as a cowboy on the ranches of [[Thomas Yerby]] and [[Pete Maxwell]] as the war went on, as well as being an active participant. Bowdre married a twenty-five-year-old [[Mexico|Mexican]] woman, Manuela Herrera, some months before his [[death]]. Manuela was a sister to Doc Scurlock's wife, María Antonia Miguela Herrera, known as Antonia. The fact that he was recently married when he died makes him less likely to have been involved in the gang's activities during the few weeks that passed between his [[marriage]] and his death.

By December 1880, Charlie Bowdre was ready to quit riding with Billy the Kid and surrender for the murder of Buckshot Roberts, but he still joined the rest of the gang on a mission to ambush [[Pat Garrett]] in [[Fort Sumner]]. A gun battle ensued, but Bowdre and most of the Kid's gang members escaped alive. On December 23, however, the gang was holed up in a rock house at [[Stinking Springs, New Mexico|Stinking Springs]]. At dawn, Charlie Bowdre emerged to feed the horses and was riddled with rifle slugs by Garrett's posse, which had surrounded the building in the night. Later that day, Billy the Kid and his partners gave up. After being riddled with bullets he fell back into the doorway where, at the urging of Billy the Kid to 'take a few of them with you when you die', Bowdre made a valiant exit.  Unfortunately he was already too weak and near death at that point and couldn't get his gun out of his holster.  In the last seconds of his life he stumbled and fell towards Pat Garrett repeating the phrase, "I wish...I wish...".&lt;ref&gt;Utley, Robert M.  ''Billy the Kid: A Short and Violent Life''.   pp. 158-159.  {{ISBN|0-8032-9558-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His remains were returned to his wife, and he was interred  next to [[Tom O'Folliard]], another member of Billy's gang. They were joined later by Billy himself, after he was killed in July, 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Utley. p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1962, a relative named Louis Bowdre was found, and a court tried to have Bowdre's remains removed. But the relative disagreed, saying that Bowdre would prefer to rest next to O'Folliard.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Portrayals==
Charlie Bowdre was played by James Congdon in the 1958 film ''[[The Left Handed Gun]]'', by Ron Soble in the [[John Wayne]] film [[Chisum]] and by [[Charles Martin Smith]] in [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid]]'' (1973). In the 1988 film ''[[Young Guns (film)|Young Guns]]'', he is portrayed by actor [[Casey Siemaszko]]. The circumstances of his death were the basis of a scene in ''[[Young Guns II]]'', however, in the movie [[Doc Scurlock]], played by [[Kiefer Sutherland]], is the one who meets his fate outside the hut, and not Bowdre. He will be portrayed by Chris Bylsma in the upcoming film ''[[The Kid (2019 film)|The Kid]]'' directed by [[Vincent D'Onofrio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/07/dane-dehaan-billy-the-kid-vincent-donofrio-valerian-the-kid-suretone-pictures-1202131369/|title=Vincent D'Onofrio Taps 'Valarian's Dane DeHaan to Play Billy the Kid in Suretone Western|date=2017-07-19|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2639">The terms '''delayed grief''' and '''unresolved grief''' are variations of [[grief|grieving]] after a loss. The meaning of ''unresolved grief'' is any aspect of grieving that has yet to be resolved.

In cases of delayed grief, the reaction to the loss is postponed until a later time, even years later, and might be triggered by a seemingly unrelated event, such as a recent divorce&lt;ref name="JWW"&gt;
   ''Grief Counselling and Grief Therapy: A Handbook'',
   James William Worden, 2003, p.46, link:
   [https://books.google.com/books?id=9qAsvt4ExgMC&amp;pg=PA46 Books-Google-MC].
&lt;/ref&gt;
or even the death of a pet, but with reactions excessive to the current situation.

The delayed grief might manifest as any of the reactions in normal grief:  pangs of intense yearning, spasms of distress, short bouts of hysterical laughter, tearful or uncontrolled sobbing, feeling of hopelessness, restlessness, [[insomnia]], preoccupation with thoughts about the loved one, extreme and unexplained anger, or general feelings of [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. In extreme cases reaction may invoke suicidal tendencies. 

The term "delayed grief" is also used to describe a ''pattern'' in which symptoms of distress, seeking, yearning (etc.), are occurring at a much later time period than is typical.&lt;ref name="NCI"&gt;

   [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/supportivecare/&lt;!--
   --&gt;bereavement/HealthProfessional/page4 Cancer-gov-HP-4].
&lt;/ref&gt;  Delayed grief refers to any reaction that occurs later than usual, as a delayed onset of symptoms.&lt;ref name="MacE"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrast to the term "complicated grief" &lt;ref name=MacE/&gt; as meaning a form of grieving that spans years (see full description at: [[Grief]]).

==Examples==
In a 1987 study, of 135 people with cancer, who were referred for psychological counseling, 76% of them reported a previous grief experience, and 60% of the cancer patients still had unresolved grief from prior losses.&lt;ref name="NCBI"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3684749 |year=1987 |last1=Vachon |first1=ML |title=Unresolved grief in persons with cancer referred for psychotherapy |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=467–86 |journal=The Psychiatric clinics of North America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edwin Valero''' (December 3, 1981 – April 19, 2010) was a Venezuelan [[professional boxer]] who competed from 2002 to 2010. He was an [[list of undefeated boxing world champions|undefeated former world champion]] in two weight classes at the time of his death, having held the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[super featherweight]] title from 2006 to 2008, and the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[lightweight]] title from 2009 to 2010. A [[southpaw stance|southpaw]] known for his highly aggressive style and exceptional punching power, Valero remains the only champion in the 30-year history of the WBC to win every fight in his career by [[knockout]]. In 2010, Valero committed suicide in jail after being arrested on suspicion of killing his wife.

==Amateur career==
Valero started boxing at the age of 12, ostensibly compiling an [[amateur boxing|amateur]] record of 86–6 with 57 knockouts. He was a Venezuelan national amateur champion three years running, as well as a Central and South American champion (beating [[Francisco Bojado]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maxboxing.com/news/sub-lead/the-fast-rise-and-tragic-fall-of-edwin-valero-december-3-1981--april-19-2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxnews.com.ua/en/Boxer/10835/Edwin-Valero&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
On February 25, 2006, Valero set a new world record by winning his first 18 fights as a professional by first-round knockout, breaking [[Arthur Susskind]]'s historic record set in 1905. That record has since been broken by [[Tyrone Brunson (boxer)|Tyrone Brunson]], but most boxing experts do not acknowledge Brunson's claim due to the extremely poor level of opposition he faced while making his way to the record&lt;ref&gt;https://fightstat.com/boxer/tyrone-brunson-20050422.html&lt;/ref&gt;; in contrast to Valero's opponents, just one of Brunson's 19 opponents had a winning record, and 6 had failed to win a single fight in their careers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&amp;id=13297 History Made. Sort of…&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his punching power and perfect knockout ratio, Valero became a cult sensation in the community.{{Who|date=October 2011}} His biggest backers in the sport included Doug Fischer of [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'' magazine]] (who, on the former boxing website he used to write for, Maxboxing.com, regularly covered Valero in his articles for the website which also aired videos of his workouts and sparring sessions) and Boxing Inside with journalist Peter Palmiere. The Los Angeles local cable show also aired Valero's workouts, sparring sessions and interviews conducted by Palmiere.

In his first attempt at a world title, on August 5, 2006, Valero faced [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[super featherweight]] champion [[Vicente Mosquera]]. In what would arguably prove to be both boxers' toughest contest, Valero started out the match in signature fashion, [[knockout#Knockdown|knocking down]] the champion twice in the first round. However, Mosquera recovered and in the third round responded by knocking Valero down, which was to be Valero's only knockdown in his career.&lt;ref&gt;http://boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:1098156&lt;/ref&gt; At this point in his 19–0 career, Valero's longest fight had only been two rounds,&lt;ref&gt;http://boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:1056427&lt;/ref&gt; and the question remained as to whether the untested Valero had the stamina to go the distance. The answer came after ten grueling rounds when the ever-tenacious Mosquera finally started to wane under the challenger's continuous heavy-handed counters. Deciding Mosquera had received enough punishment, the referee called a halt to the match at 2:00 of round ten, making the 24-year-old Valero champion. Valero would go on to successfully defend the title four times before moving up in weight class, with his final defense a seventh-round [[knockout#Technical knockout|stoppage]] over Takehiro Shimada in [[Tokyo]] on June 12, 2008.

On September 3, 2008, Valero vacated his WBA title to fight in the [[lightweight]] division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightnews.com/fightnews_2/headlines//EkkpuylpEEUZZVzRtX.html |title=Valero gives up WBA title! |publisher=Fightnews.com |date=September 3, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905230109/http://www.fightnews.com/fightnews_2/headlines//EkkpuylpEEUZZVzRtX.html |archivedate=September 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He fought [[Antonio Pitalua]] for the vacant [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] lightweight title on April 4, 2009 in [[Austin]], Texas. The bout marked the first time Valero had fought in the United States since 2003. Pitalua came into the fight with 14 consecutive knockouts on his 46–3 record, and with Valero's 24 consecutive knockouts, the stage was set for a decisive match between two heavy hitters. After an uneventful first round, Valero knocked Pitalua down just seconds into the second round with a right [[hook (boxing)|hook]]. Pitalua managed to get up, but suffered two more knockdowns before the referee stopped the fight at 0:49 of round two.&lt;ref&gt;http://boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:1386657&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valero's next fight came on his home turf of Venezuela, in [[La Guaira]], where he successfully defended his WBC lightweight title by a TKO victory over Hector Velasquez in the seventh round. Valero's second and final defense of the belt came against [[Antonio DeMarco]] in Mexico, on February 6, 2010. In the second round, Valero suffered a serious cut over his right eye after DeMarco landed an unintentional elbow.&lt;ref&gt;http://boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:1480627&lt;/ref&gt; Valero was able to continue the fight and went on to win by [[referee technical decision|corner retirement]] when DeMarco failed to answer the bell for the tenth round. This would be Valero's last match. In March 2010, Valero vacated his WBC title in order to compete in the [[light welterweight]] division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwinvalero.net/edwin-valero-vacates-belt-returns-to-training/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322231035/http://www.edwinvalero.net/edwin-valero-vacates-belt-returns-to-training/ |archivedate=2010-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Valero's professional record at the time of his death was 27–0, making him one of [[list of undefeated boxing world champions|the few world champions to finish their careers undefeated]].

== Career roadblocks ==
On February 5, 2001, Valero was involved in a severe motorcycle accident in which he was not wearing a helmet.  He fractured his skull and had surgery to remove a blood clot.  This injury was sustained prior to him launching his pro career, and it created roadblocks to major bodies sanctioning his fights.  Valero claimed that his doctor cleared him to fight on January 17, 2002, and he turned pro that July with a first-round KO.

Valero appeared to hit the jackpot when he was signed after his 12th pro fight by [[Golden Boy Promotions]].  Valero was scheduled to appear on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Boxing After Dark]]'', but in January 2004, he failed an [[MRI]] due to brain scan irregularities in [[New York (state)|New York]] and thus was not allowed to fight in the [[United States]].  As a result, the fight did not take place.  He continued to fight outside the US and on March 25, 2008, Valero was cleared to box in the state of [[Texas]].&lt;ref name="espn20080325"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Dan Rafael|date=March 25, 2008|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=3311639|title=Banned in U.S. since '04, Valero granted license in Texas|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegations of assault ==
It was reported on September 27, 2009, that Edwin Valero had been arrested on assault charges. A man alleged that the boxer attacked his mother and sister over a feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valero denied the allegations and considered them an attempt to harm his reputation. His mother came forward to tell the media that no foul play was involved.

On March 25, 2010, Valero was again accused of assault, this time by his wife, who was sent to hospital for bruises and a damaged lung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Death==
On April 18, 2010, Valero was arrested after police found the body of his 24-year-old wife, Jennifer Carolina Viera de Valero, in a hotel in the city of [[Valencia, Carabobo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 26, 2010 |title=For the Record: Died |journal=[[Sports Illustrated]] |volume=112 |issue=18 |page=18 |publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time]] |editor1-first=Terry |editor1-last=McDonell |editor1-link=Terry McDonell }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/box/news;_ylt=AiS6.BuI6yKsZyUovqtnCYZxYQM6?slug=capress-box_valero_slaying-163054724&lt;/ref&gt; She had been stabbed three times.&lt;ref name="NYDN19"&gt;Mitch Abramson, "[http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/edwin-valero-wbc-lightweight-champion-confesses-killing-wife-article-1.165252 Boxer Valero admits killing wife]", ''[[New York Daily News]]'' (19 April 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI19"&gt;"[https://www.si.com/boxing/2010/04/19/valero-suicide Valero denied murder, relatives reveal dark secrets]", ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' (19 April 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Valero was considered a suspect and was taken to jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Elisabeth of Valois''' ({{lang-es|Isabel de Valois}}; {{lang-fr|Élisabeth de France}}) (2 April 1545 &amp;ndash; 3 October 1568) was a [[List of Spanish consorts|Spanish queen consort]] as the third spouse of [[Philip II of Spain]]. She was the eldest daughter of [[Henry II of France]] and [[Catherine de' Medici]].{{sfn|Knecht|1999|p=34}}

==Early life==
She was born in the [[Château de Fontainebleau]]. She was raised under the supervision of the governor and governess of the royal children, Jean d'Humières and [[Françoise d'Humières]]. Her childhood was spent in the French royal nursery, where her father insisted she share her bedroom with her future sister-in-law, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], who was about three years older than Elisabeth.  Even though Elisabeth had to give precedence to Mary (since Mary was already a crowned queen), the two would remain close friends for the rest of their lives. While it is acknowledged that her sister [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] and her future sister-in-law Mary were prettier than she, she was one of Catherine's attractive daughters. Elisabeth was also described as being shy, timid and very much in awe of her formidable mother; although there is also evidence that Catherine was tender and loving toward Elisabeth. This was certainly evident in her letters to Elisabeth.

In 1550, Elisabeth's father, Henry, began negotiations for her marriage to [[Edward VI of England]].{{sfn|Baumgartner|1988|p=123}} This arrangement brought condemnation from [[Pope Julius III]] who reportedly stated that he would excommunicate both{{efn|Henry and Elisabeth?{{sfn|Baumgartner|1988|p=123}}}} if they married.{{sfn|Baumgartner|1988|p=123}} Henry, undeterred, agreed to a 200,000 ecus dowry, which became irrelevant upon Edward's death in 1553.{{sfn|Baumgartner|1988|p=123}}

==Queen of Spain==
[[Image:Eugène Isabey - The Departure of Elisabeth of France for Spain - Walters 3790.jpg|thumb|left|This painting by [[Eugène Isabey]] depicts Elisabeth, dressed more like a widow than a bride, swooning as she is led to the carriage that will bear her away from France to marry King Philip II of Spain.{{sfn|Isabey|1858}} The Walters Art Museum.]]

Elisabeth married [[Philip II of Spain]] son of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Isabella of Portugal]] in 1559. Originally [[Proxy marriage|married via proxy]] at [[Notre Dame Cathedral|Notre Dame]] (with the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] standing in for Philip) prior to leaving France,{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=74}} the actual ceremony took place in [[Guadalajara (province)|Guadalajara]], Spain, upon her arrival. The marriage was a result of the [[Peace of Cateau Cambrésis]] (1559).{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=74}} His second wife, [[Mary I of England]], had recently died, making Elisabeth of Valois Philip's third wife.

At her wedding, she met the famous painter [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] and [[Ana de Mendoza, Princess of Eboli|Ana de Mendoza]], who would live with her the rest of her life.{{sfn|Nader|2003|p=1}} [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]] appointed Anguissola to be a lady-in-waiting and court painter for his queen. Under Anguissola's tutelage, Elisabeth improved her amateur painting skills. Anguissola also influenced the artistic works of her children, [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]] and [[Infanta Catherine Michelle of Spain|Caterina Michaela]], during her time at the court.

Philip was completely enchanted by his 14-year-old bride,{{sfn|Carrión|2010|p=74}} and by 1564 had given up his infidelities.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=90}} Despite the significant age difference, Elisabeth was also quite pleased with her husband. (In letters to her mother, she proclaimed herself to be fortunate to have married so charming a prince.) Philip enjoyed hosting [[Chivalry in Spain|chivalric]] tournaments to entertain his wife.  Elisabeth would play liege lady to the three young princes of the Spanish Court: [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]], [[John of Austria]] (illegitimate son of Charles V), and [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma]] (son of Charles V's illegitimate daughter Margaret).

Elisabeth had originally been betrothed to Philip's son, [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]], but political complications unexpectedly necessitated instead a marriage to Philip. Her relationship with her troubled stepson Carlos was warm and friendly. Despite reports of his progressively bizarre behavior, Carlos was always kind and gentle to Elisabeth.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=120-121}}  When it eventually became necessary for Philip to lock him away (which shortly led to the Prince’s demise), Elisabeth cried for days.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=121}}

Philip was very attached to Elisabeth, staying close by her side even when she was ill with [[smallpox]]. Elisabeth's first pregnancy in 1564 ended with a [[miscarriage]] of twin girls. She later gave birth to [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain]] on 12 August 1566, and then to Isabella's younger sister [[Catherine Michelle of Spain]] on 10 October 1567. Elisabeth had another miscarriage on 3 October 1568, and died the same day,{{sfn|Knecht|1988|p=134}} along with her newborn infant daughter.

After the death of Elisabeth, [[Catherine de' Medici]] offered her younger daughter [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] as a bride for Philip.{{sfn|Knecht|1988|p=134}} Philip declined the offer.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=125}}

==In fiction==
[[File:Coat of Arms of Elisabeth of France (1545-1568), Queen Consort of Spain.svg|thumb|150px|Coat of arms of Elisabeth of France, Queen of Spain.]]

Elisabeth of Valois is a central character in [[Thomas Otway]]'s play ''Don Carlos'', in [[Schiller]]'s [[Don Carlos (play)|play of the same name]],  in [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s opera adapted from Schiller's play, also titled ''[[Don Carlos]]'', and in [[Don Carlos (play)#Opera adaptations|several other, less well-known operas]]; [[Antonio Buzzolla]]'s version of 1850 is actually named "Elisabetta di Valois". All these works imply a tragic romance between Elisabeth and Carlos, suggesting that they were really in love with each other when Elisabeth was forced to break off her engagement to Carlos and marry his father Philip.

In [[Madame de Lafayette]]'s novella ''The Princesse de Cleves'', Elisabeth of Valois' marriage to Philip II is the occasion for the wedding games at which her father [[Henry II of France|Henri II]] dies; her role is brief but it substantially affects the novella's narrative arc.

Elisabeth of Valois is portrayed by Caoimhe O'Malley (in the Pilot) on the CW show, [[Reign (TV series)|Reign]], then later by [[Anastasia Phillips]] in the fourth season of the show. Rather than the “plain Jane” of her family the character is portrayed as beautiful and her timid and shy personality is changed to that of one more forceful, cold, insensitive and quite controlling which is driven out of her legitimate desire for her [[Catherine de' Medici|mother’s]] affections. Her name ''Elisabeth'' is spelled with an S instead of a Z though in the fourth season she is simply called ''Leeza'' as not to be confused with [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. In the first episode, Leeza is married to King Philip of Spain, leaves for Spain with her husband without speaking any lines, and isn't physically seen until fourth season of the show. Though not seen until the fourth season, she is mentioned as a possible option for god-mother to her King Francis' (her brother's) son John in the second season. In the third season, her kingdom is chosen as a safe haven for her younger sisters and brothers after a group calling themselves "The Red Knights" threaten revenge on the Valois family. Making her physical return to the show, she is one of the four Queens ([[Mary, Queen of Scots|Queen Mary]], Queen Elizabeth I and her mother, regent Queen Catherine) to be featured during the season. During her appearance, she spends time in French court as a [[Diplomacy|envoy]] of Spain and voice of her husband's wishes as well rival for her mother.

Elisabeth of Valois is a major character in ''The Creation of Eve'', a novel by Lynn Cullen based on the history of [[Sofonisba Anguissola]], the first renowned female artist of the Italian Renaissance. In the novel, Sofonisba is the painting tutor and premier lady-in-waiting for young Queen Elisabeth.

'''Ernest Braun''' (9 March 1925 – 3 March 2015) was a British-Austrian scholar in technology policy and technology assessment.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Vienna]] as Czechoslovak citizen, Braun grew up in Czechoslovakia. He studied physics at [[Charles University in Prague]] (1952 MSc, Dr.rer.nat.), PhD in solid state physics ([[Bristol university|Bristol]] 1959). Research in industrial research laboratory, then changed to University career. Appointed professor of physics at [[Aston University]] in Birmingham (1967). In 1973 started an interdisciplinary post-graduate research unit, the Technology Policy Unit (TPU). The topics of research embraced all social aspects of technology, including questions of policy, [[technology assessment]], and the process and effects of technological innovation. In the same year Ernest Braun, together with the late Bill Williams and Michael Gibbons founded an interuniversity group known as “Science in a Social Context” (SISCON). This group obtained some funding and hired research fellows who produced teaching texts published by Butterworth. The purpose was to assist in the teaching of social aspects of science and technology to undergraduates in a variety of disciplines. The TPU at Aston University started an MSc course under the title “Social Aspects of Science and Technology” and also recruited several doctoral students. Many of the graduates of the doctoral programme later became professors in British universities. Also [[David Collingridge]], the author of the [[Collingridge dilemma]] worked at TPU.
In 1982/83 Braun was visiting professor at [[Vienna Technical University]]. In 1984 he retired from Aston University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.aston.ac.uk/about/history/emeritus-professors |title=Emeritus Professors |work=aston.ac.uk |accessdate=4 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204103302/http://www.aston.ac.uk/about/history/emeritus-professors/ |archivedate=4 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and became visiting professor at [[University of Vienna]], followed by several free-lance research projects in Austria. In 1985 he joined the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] (OAW), where he started a research group on [[technology assessment]]. In 1988, this group became the Technology Assessment Unit (FTB), headed by him till his retirement from the OAW in 1991, when he returned to England. Braun was followed by Gunther Tichy and under his leadership the FTB became a fully-fledged [[Institute of Technology Assessment]] (ITA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hw.oeaw.ac.at/0xc1aa500d_0x00107759.pdf Nentwich/Peissl] (PDF file; 272&amp;nbsp;kB) p. 12/13.&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to England, Braun became visiting professor in the [[Open University]] in Milton Keynes. When he finally retired in 1994 he lived for five years in Portugal and in 2010 moved to Austria with his wife Doris (née Luttenberger), a painter. He had two daughters from his first marriage, both living in London. He died on 3 March 2015  in Bruckneudorf, just 6 days shy of his 90th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oeaw.ac.at/ita/en/about-us/news/ernst-braun-1925-2015|title=ITA: Ernest Braun 1925-2015|work=oeaw.ac.at|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements ==
Braun is regarded as a European pioneer of [[Science and technology studies|social studies in science and technology]] in general, and of [[technology assessment]] in particular. In Austria he is regarded as the founder of technology assessment. He has written several books and many journal articles. His best known books are probably Revolution in Miniature (with Stuart Macdonald) 1978, Futile Progress 1995, Technology in Context 1998. His last book, From Need to Greed, The Changing Role of Technology in Society, published in 2010.

Major '''Hampden Zane Churchill Cockburn''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN-cats|VC}} (19 November 1867 &amp;ndash; 12 July 1913) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] soldier, and recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the  most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.

==Second Boer War==

[[File:Cockburn VC f&amp;b.JPG|thumb|Obverse and reverse of Cockburn's Victoria Cross|left]]Born in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, Cockburn was a graduate of [[Upper Canada College]] in Toronto.

When the [[Second Boer War]] broke out in 1899, Cockburn was a 32-year-old [[lieutenant]] in [[The Royal Canadian Dragoons]], [[Canadian Militia]], and was posted to South Africa with his regiment, where the action took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 7 November 1900, during the [[Battle of Leliefontein]] near the [[Komati River]], a large force of Boer commandos sought to encircle a retreating British column whose rearguard comprised two troops of Royal Canadian Dragoons and two 12-pounder guns of "D" Battery, Royal Canadian Field Artillery.&lt;ref name=DND&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/gal/vcg-gcv/bio/cockburn-hzc-eng.asp | title = Victoria Cross - The South African (Boer) War 1899-1902: Hampden Zane Churchill Cockburn | website = National defence and the Canadian Forces | publisher = Department of National Defence | access-date = 2015-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cockburn and [[Richard Ernest William Turner|Lieutenant Richard Turner]] commanded a small group of troopers who repulsed the Boers at close range, allowing the two field guns to escape capture. [[Edward James Gibson Holland|Sergeant Edward Holland]] of the Royal Canadian Dragoons, ably assisted them with good machine-gun work, finally fleeing in the face of superior Boer force with the machine gun under his arm to avoid its capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/boer/victoriacrossrecipients_e.shtml | title = Canada &amp; The South African War, 1899-1902: Canadian Victoria Cross Recipients | website = Canadian War Museum | access-date = 2015-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the men under Cockburn's command were either killed, wounded or captured. Cockburn was also wounded during the action.

Following the battle, three men of the Royal Canadian Dragoons were awarded the Victoria Cross: Cockburn, Turner and Holland.

The citations were published in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' of 23 April 1901. Cockburn's read:

''{{quote|Lieutenant Cockburn, with a handful of men, at a most critical moment held off the Boers to allow the guns to get away; to do so he had to sacrifice himself and his party, all of whom were killed, wounded, or taken prisoners, he himself being slightly wounded.''&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27307|page=2775|date=23 April 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Return to Canada ==
Following the Boer War, Cockburn returned to Canada, and eventually achieved the rank of [[major]]. He died in a horse-riding accident in Grayburn, Saskatchewan,&lt;ref name=DND /&gt; in 1913, and was buried at [[St. James Cemetery (Toronto)|St. James Cemetery, Toronto]], Ontario, with a headstone at Hill A. Section S 1/2. Lot 11.

== Medal ==
Cockburn's Victoria Cross and sword were, for many years, displayed in the lobby of his alma mater, Upper Canada College. In 1977, the school had a high-quality copy made for display, and moved the original to safe-keeping.

{{Campaignbox Norman Conquest}}



The '''Harrying of the North''' was a number of campaigns 
waged by [[William the Conqueror]] in the winter of 1069–70 to subjugate [[northern England]], where the presence of the last [[House of Wessex|Wessex]] claimant, [[Edgar the Atheling|Edgar Atheling]], had encouraged Anglo-Danish rebellions. William paid the Danes to go home, but the remaining rebels refused to meet him in battle, and he decided to starve them out by laying waste to the northern shires, especially the city of [[York]], before installing a Norman aristocracy throughout the region.

Contemporary chronicles vividly record the savagery of the campaign, the huge scale of the destruction and the widespread famine caused by looting, burning and slaughtering. Some present-day scholars have labelled the campaigns a [[genocide]] although others doubt whether William could have assembled enough troops to inflict so much damage and they have concluded that the records may have been exaggerated or misinterpreted.

==Background==
{{see also|Gwynedd in the High Middle Ages#Mathrafal ascendency and English alliances; 1063–1081|l1=Gwynedd's alliance with Mercia and Northumbria}}
At the time of the Norman Conquest ''the North'' consisted of what became [[Yorkshire]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], and [[Northumberland]] in the east and [[Lancashire]] with the southern parts of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]] in the west.&lt;ref name=kapell5&gt;William E. Kapelle, The Norman Conquest of the North. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the north pre-conquest can be described as "[[Anglo-Scandinavian]]" carrying a cultural continuity from a mixing of [[Viking]] and Anglo-Saxon traditions. The dialect of [[Old English|English]] spoken in Yorkshire may well have been unintelligible to people from the south of England, and the aristocracy was primarily [[Danish people|Danish]] in origin.&lt;ref name=kapelle11&gt;Kapelle, pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, communications between the north and south were difficult, partly due to the terrain but also because of the poor state of the roads. The more popular route between York and the south was by ship.&lt;ref name=kapelle7&gt;Kapelle, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 962 [[Edgar the Peaceful]] had granted legal autonomy to the northern earls of the [[Danelaw]] in return for their loyalty; this had limited the powers of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kings who succeeded him north of the [[Humber]]. The earldom of Northumbria stretched from the [[River Tees|Tees]] to the [[River Tweed|Tweed]].&lt;ref name=kapelle11/&gt;

After the defeat of the English army and death of [[Harold Godwinson]] at the [[Battle of Hastings]], English resistance to the conquest was centred on [[Edgar Ætheling]], the grandson of [[Edmund Ironside]]. Ironside was half-brother to [[Edward the Confessor]].&lt;ref name="horspool5"&gt;Horspool. ''The English Rebel'', pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said the English conceded defeat, not at [[Hastings]], but at [[Berkhamsted]] two months later when Edgar and his supporters submitted to William in December 1066.&lt;ref name="horspool5"/&gt; However, of all the men who submitted to William at Berkhamsted it was only [[Ealdred (bishop)|Ealdred]], [[Bishop of York]], who would remain loyal to the Norman king.&lt;ref name=horspool7&gt;Horspool, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; William faced a series of rebellions and border skirmishes in [[Dover]], [[Exeter]], [[Hereford]], [[Nottingham]], Durham, [[York]] and [[Peterborough]].&lt;ref name=horspool8&gt;Horspool, pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baile Hill - geograph.org.uk - 765177.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of the [[Motte-and-bailey castle|motte]] at [[Baile Hill, York]] 1068–69.]]
[[Copsi]], a supporter of [[Tostig]] (a previous Anglo-Saxon earl of Northumbria who had been banished by Edward the Confessor), was a native of Northumbria and his family had a history of being rulers of [[Bernicia]], and at times Northumbria. Copsi had fought in [[Harald Hardrada]]'s army with Tostig, against Harold Godwinson at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] in 1066. He had managed to escape after Harald's defeat. When Copsi offered homage to William at [[Barking, London|Barking]] in 1067, William rewarded him by making him earl of Northumbria.&lt;ref name=kapelle103&gt;Kapelle, pp. 103–06.&lt;/ref&gt;

After just five weeks as earl, Copsi was murdered by [[Osulf, Earl of Bamburgh|Osulf]], son of Earl [[Eadulf III of Bernicia]]. When, in turn, the usurping Osulf was also killed, his cousin, [[Cospatrick of Northumbria|Cospatrick]], bought the earldom from William. He was not long in power before he joined [[Edgar Ætheling]] in rebellion against William in 1068.&lt;ref name=kapelle103/&gt;

With two earls murdered and one changing sides, William decided to intervene personally in Northumbria.&lt;ref name=horspool10&gt;Horspool, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; He marched north and arrived in York during the summer of 1068. The opposition melted away, with some of them&amp;nbsp;– including Edgar&amp;nbsp;– taking refuge at the court of the [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Scottish king Malcolm III]].&lt;ref name=stenton606&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pg. 606&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Northumbria, William changed tack and appointed a Norman, [[Robert de Comines]], as earl, rather than an Anglo-Saxon. Despite warnings from the [[bishop of Durham|bishop]], [[Ethelwin]], that a rebel army was mobilised against him, Robert rode into Durham with a party of men on 28 January 1069, where he and his men were surrounded and slaughtered.&lt;ref name=asc1068&gt;''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' 1068. English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html Project Gutenberg]; accessdate 26 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels then turned their attention to York where they killed the guardian of the [[York Castle|castle]] there plus a large number of his men.&lt;ref name=horspool10/&gt;&lt;ref name=asc1068/&gt; William's response was swift and brutal: he returned to York, where he fell on the besiegers, killing or putting them to flight.&lt;ref name=horspool11&gt;Horspool, ''The English Rebel'', pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly emboldened by the fighting in the north, rebellions broke out in other parts of the country. William sent earls to deal with problems in [[Dorset]], [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Devon]], while he dealt with rebels in the [[The Midlands|Midlands]] and [[Stafford]].&lt;ref name=horspool12&gt;Horspool. ''The English Rebel''. pg. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edgar Ætheling had sought assistance from the [[king of Denmark]], [[Sweyn Estridson|Sweyn II]], a nephew of [[Canute the Great|King Canute]]. Sweyn assembled a fleet of ships under the command of his sons. The fleet sailed up the east coast of England raiding as they went. The [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] with their English allies retook the city of York.&lt;ref name=asc1069&gt;''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' 1069. English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html Project Gutenberg]; accessdate 26 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in the winter of 1069, William marched his army from Nottingham to York with the intention of engaging the rebel army. However, by the time William's army had reached York, the rebel army had fled, with Edgar returning to Scotland. As they had nowhere suitable on land to stay for the winter, the Danes decided to go back to their ships in the [[Humber Estuary]]. After negotiation with William, it was agreed that, if he made payment to them, then they would go home to [[Denmark]] without a fight.&lt;ref name=kapelle117&gt;Kapelle, pg. 117&lt;/ref&gt; With the Danes having returned home, William's patience with the rebels seems to have run out. As they were not prepared to meet his army in [[pitched battle]], he employed a strategy that would attack the rebel army's sources of support and their food supply.&lt;ref name=horspool12/&gt;

==The Harrying==
William's strategy, implemented during the winter of 1069–70 (he spent Christmas 1069 in York), has been described by [[William E. Kapelle]] and some other modern scholars as an act of [[genocide]].&lt;ref name=kapelle3&gt;Kapelle, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rex108&gt;Rex.

''Conquest, Anarchy and Lordship: Yorkshire, 1066–1154''. pg. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about the Harrying of the North, over fifty years later, the Anglo-Norman chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]] wrote (summarized):{{quote|The King stopped at nothing to hunt his enemies. He cut down many people and destroyed homes and land. Nowhere else had he shown such cruelty. This made a real change.
To his shame, William made no effort to control his fury, punishing the innocent with the guilty. He ordered that crops and herds, tools and food be burned to ashes. More than 100,000 people perished of starvation.&lt;br&gt;I have often praised William in this book, but I can say nothing good about this brutal slaughter.

The land was ravaged on either side of William's route north from the [[River Aire]]. His army destroyed crops and settlements and forced rebels into hiding. In the New Year of 1070 he split his army into smaller units and sent them out to burn, loot, and terrify.&lt;ref name=dalto11&gt;Dalton, pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florence of Worcester]] said  that from the Humber to the [[Tees]], William's men burnt whole villages and slaughtered the inhabitants. Food stores and livestock were destroyed so that anyone surviving the initial [[massacre]] would succumb to starvation over the winter. The survivors were reduced to [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref name=forester174&gt;Forester, Thomas. ''The Chronicle of Florence of Worcester'', pg. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1086, Yorkshire and the North Riding still had large areas of waste territory. The Domesday Book entries indicate ''wasteas est'' or ''hoc est vast'' (''it is wasted'') for estate after estate; in all a total of 60% of all holdings were waste. It states that 66% of all villages contained wasted manors. Even the prosperous areas of the county had lost 60% of its value compared to 1066. Only 25% of the population and plough teams remained with a reported loss of 80,000 oxen and 150,000 people.&lt;ref name=muir120&gt;Muir.

''Armies, chivalry and warfare in medieval Britain and France: proceedings of the 1995 Harlaxton Symposium'' (p. 273).&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent archaeological evidence supports the massive destruction and displacement of people. The archaeologist [[Richard Ernest Muir]] wrote that there was evidence for the "violent disruption [that] took place in Yorkshire in 1069–71, in the form of hoards of coins which were buried by the inhabitants."&lt;ref name=muir120/&gt; B.K. Roberts in his book ''The Making of the English Village'', suggests the reason that large numbers of villages have been laid out in regular pattern in Durham and  Yorkshire, was through a restructuring at a single point in time, as opposed to natural settlement growth. He goes on to say that it is highly unlikely that such plans could have resulted from piecemeal additions and must have been necessary after the Harrying of the North.  The dating is thought to be secure as it is known that Norman lords used similar regular plans in founding new towns in the 'plantation' of rural settlements in other conquered parts of the British Isles.&lt;ref name=oup126&gt;Hey. ''The Oxford Companion to family and local history''. pg. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roberts178&gt;Roberts. ''The Making of the English Village'', pp. 212–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eh5&gt;Stamper.

However, although the Domesday Book records large numbers of manors in the north as waste, some historians have posited it was not possible for William's relatively small army to be responsible for such wide-scale devastation imputed to him, so perhaps raiding Danes {{efn|name=Florence|According to Florence of Worcester ".. [William] sent messengers to the Danish earl and promised to pay him secretly a large sum of money, and to grant permission for the Danish army to forage freely along the sea coast, on condition that the Danes would depart without fighting when the winter was over." &lt;ref name=forester173&gt;Forester, Thomas.

The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' MS E for 1079 said that Malcolm "ravaged Northumberland as far as the Tyne and killed many hundreds of people and took home much money and people into captivity".}} may have contributed to some of the destruction. It has been variously argued that ''waste'' signified manorial re-organisation, some form of tax break, or merely a confession of ignorance by the Domesday commissioners when unable to determine details of population and other manorial resources.&lt;ref name=thoms95&gt;Thomas.

According to Paul Dalton,&lt;ref name=dalto23/&gt; it was questionable whether the Conqueror had the time, manpower or good weather necessary to reduce the north to a desert. It was evident, from the chroniclers, that William did harry the north but as the bulk of William's troops, Dalton suggests, were guarding castles in southern England and Wales, and as William was only in the north for a maximum of three months, the amount of damage he could do was limited.&lt;ref name=dalto23/&gt;

Mark Hagger&lt;ref name=hagger100/&gt; suggests that in the words of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', William's Harrying of the North was "stern beyond measure"&lt;ref name=asc1087&gt;ASC 1087 - English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html Project Gutenberg]. Accessdate 21 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; but we should not describe it as genocide as William was acting by the [[Genocides in history|rules of his own time]], not ours.{{efn|name=moses28}}&lt;ref name=hagger100&gt;Hagger. ''William King and Conqueror'', pp. 100–01.&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetius, the Latin writer, wrote his treatise ''[[De Re Militari]]'' in the fourth century about Roman warfare, and posits that this still would have provided the basis for military thinking in the eleventh century.&lt;ref name=hagger100/&gt; Vegetius said ''The main and principal point in war is to secure plenty of provisions and to destroy the enemy by famine'', so Hagger's conclusion is that the Harrying of the North was no worse than other similar conflicts of the time.&lt;ref name=hagger100/&gt;&lt;ref name=vegetius&gt;Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus.

Other historians have questioned the figures supplied by Orderic Vitalis, who was born in 1075 and would have been writing his ''Ecclesiastical History'' around 55 years after the event. The figure of 100,000 deaths was perhaps used in a rhetorical sense, as the estimated population for the whole of England, based on the 1086 Domesday returns was about 2.25 million; thus, a figure of 100,000 represented a large proportion of the entire population of the country at that time (~4.5%).&lt;ref name=horspool13/&gt;&lt;ref name=muir120/&gt;&lt;ref name=bartlett291&gt;Bartlett. ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'', pg. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Horspool]] concludes that despite the Harrying of the North, being regarded with some "shock" in Northern England for some centuries after the event, the destruction may have been exaggerated and the number of dead not as high as previously thought.&lt;ref name=horspool13/&gt;

In 1071 William appointed another Earl of Northumbria. This time it was [[William Walcher]], a [[Lotharingian]], who was the first non-English [[Bishop of Durham]].&lt;ref name=Handbook241&gt;Fryde, et al.

Having effectively subdued the population, William carried out a complete replacement of Anglo-Saxon leaders with Norman ones in the North. The new aristocracy in England was predominately of Norman extraction; however, one exception was that of [[Alan Rufus]], a trusted [[Breton people|Breton]] lord, who obtained in 1069–1071 a substantial fiefdom in North Yorkshire, which the [[Domesday Book]] calls "the Hundred of the Land of Count Alan", later known as [[Richmondshire]].&lt;ref name=barlow114&gt;Frank Barlow, ''The Feudal Kingdom of England, 1042–1216'' (London; New York: Longmans, Green, 1955), pg. 114, [https://www.questia.com/read/91383886 Questia.com] accessdate 27 August 2013.

Here Alan governed, as it were, his own principality: the only location held by the King in this area was [[Ainderby Steeple]] on its eastern edge, while Robert of Mortain held one village on its southern fringe; the other Norman lords were excluded, whereas Alan retained the surviving Anglo-Danish lords or their heirs. Alan also exercised patronage in York, where he founded [[St Mary's Abbey, York|St Mary's Abbey]] in 1088. By 1086 Alan was one of the richest and most powerful men in England.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Keats-Rohan "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/52358 Alan Rufus (died 1093)]", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''; retrieved 27 August 2013.{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scotland]], Malcolm married the Ætheling's sister, [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], in 1071.&lt;ref name="stenton606"/&gt; Edgar sought Malcolm's assistance in his struggle against William.&lt;ref name=horspool10 /&gt; The marriage of Malcolm to Edgar's sister profoundly affected the history of both England and Scotland. The influence of Margaret and her sons brought about the Anglicisation of the Lowlands and provided the Scottish king with an excuse for forays into England, which he could claim were to redress the wrongs against his brother-in-law.&lt;ref name=poole265&gt;Poole. ''From Domesday Book to Magna Carta, 1087–1216'' 2nd ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 1993), pg. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal link between the royal house of Scotland and [[Wessex]] was a threat to William, who marched up to Scotland in 1072 to confront the Scottish king. The two kings negotiated the [[Treaty of Abernethy]] (1072), through which, according to the ''Anglo Saxon Chronicle'', Malcolm became William's vassal; among the other provisions was the expulsion of Edgar Ætheling from the Scottish court.&lt;ref name=asc1072/&gt;&lt;ref name=huscroft61&gt;Huscroft. ''Ruling England, 1042–1217'', pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Edgar finally submitted to William in 1074. William's hold on the crown was then theoretically uncontested.&lt;ref name="huscroft61"/&gt;&lt;ref name=horspool14&gt;Horspool, pg. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1080 [[Walcher]], the Bishop of Durham, was murdered by the local Northumbrians. In response, William sent his half-brother [[Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]] north with an army to harry the Northumbrian countryside. Odo destroyed much land north of the Tees, from York to Durham, and stole valuable items from Durham monastery. Many of the Northumbrian nobility were driven into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Rollason. ''Libellus de Exordio.'' pp. 218–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the depopulation, Norman landowners sought settlers to work in the fields. Evidence suggests that such barons were willing to rent lands to any men not obviously disloyal. Unlike the [[Vikings]] in the centuries before, Normans did not settle wholesale in the shire, but only occupied the upper ranks of society. This allowed an Anglo-Scandinavian culture to survive beneath Norman rule. Evidence for continuity can be seen in the retention of many cultural traits:{{quote|Many personal names of a pre-conquest character appear in charters that date from the 11th to the 13th century. The vigorous northern literary tradition in the Middle English period and its distinctive dialect also suggest the survival of an Anglo-Scandinavian population. The relative scarcity of Norman place-names implies that the new settlers came in only at the top rank. Domesday Book shows that at this level, however, Norman takeover in Yorkshire was virtually complete.&lt;ref name=hey19&gt;Hey. ''Yorkshire from AD 1000.'' p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Normans used the church as an agent of colonisation and, post-1070, founded several monasteries in the north. There had been no monasteries north of [[Burton upon Trent]] before the harrying.&lt;ref name=harper171/&gt; Of the monasteries built, Fountains Abbey became one of the largest and richest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Fountains Abbey History|url=http://cistercians.shef.ac.uk/fountains/|publisher=University of Sheffield|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the foundation of the northern monasteries, the Normans increased the number of [[motte-and-bailey castle]]s they built there.&lt;ref name=harper171/&gt;

From the Norman point of view, the Harrying of the North was a successful strategy, as large areas, including [[Cheshire]], [[Shropshire]], [[Derbyshire]] and [[Staffordshire]] were devastated, and the Domesday Book confirms this, although in those counties it was not as complete as in Yorkshire. The object of the harrying was to prevent further revolts in [[Mercia]] and Northumbria; however, it did not prevent rebellions elsewhere.&lt;ref name=stenton605&gt;Stenton.

In [[justice]] and [[law]], '''house arrest''' (also called '''home confinement''', '''home detention''', or, in modern times, '''electronic monitoring''') is a measure by which a person is confined by the authorities to their [[House|residence]]. Only those with a house are allowed to be sentenced to arrest in their residence. [[Travel]] is usually restricted, if allowed at all. House arrest is an alternative to being in a [[prison]] while pre-trial or sentenced.

While house arrest can be applied to criminal cases when prison does not seem an appropriate measure, the term is often applied to the use of house confinement as a measure of repression by [[authoritarian]] governments against political [[dissident]]s. In that case, typically, the person under house arrest does not have access to any [[telephone|means of communication]]. If electronic communication is allowed, conversations will most likely be monitored. With some electronic monitoring units, the conversations of prisoners can be directly monitored via the unit itself.

==History==
Judges have imposed sentences of home confinement, as an alternative to prison, as far back as the 17th century. [[Galileo]] was confined to his home following his [[Galileo affair|infamous trial]] in 1633. Political authorities have often confined leaders to house arrest who were deposed in a coup d'état, but this method was not widely used to confine numerous common criminals.

This method did not become a widespread alternative to imprisonment in the United States and other western countries until the late 20th century, when newly designed electronic monitoring devices made it inexpensive and easy to manage by corrections authorities.  Although Boston was using house arrest for a variety of arrangements, the first-ever court sentence of house arrest with an [[electronic bracelet]] was in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2209984/ |work=Slate Magazine |title=You're Grounded! How do you qualify for house arrest? |author=Juliet Lapidos |date=January 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
Home detention is an alternative to [[Incarceration|imprisonment]]; its goals are both to reduce recidivism and to decrease the number of prisoners, thereby saving money for states and other jurisdictions. It is a corrective to mandatory sentencing laws that greatly increased the incarceration rates in the United States.&lt;ref name=lev&gt;Levinson, David. (2002). ''Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment: Volumes I-IV.'' SAGE Publications. p. 859. {{ISBN|978-0-7619-2258-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows eligible offenders to retain or seek employment, maintain family relationships and responsibilities and attend rehabilitative programs that contribute towards addressing the causes of their offending.

The terms of house arrest can differ, but most programs allow employed offenders to continue to work, and confine them to their residence only during non-working hours. Offenders are commonly allowed to leave their home for specific purposes; examples can include visits to the [[probation officer]] or police station, religious services, education, attorney visits, court appearances, and medical appointments.&lt;ref&gt;Spohn, Cassia. (2008). ''How Do Judges Decide?: The Search for Fairness and Justice in Punishment.'' SAGE Publications Inc. p. 52. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-6104-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-19/strauss-kahn-granted-bail-pending-trial-in-hotel-maid-sexual-assault-case.html|title=Strauss-Kahn May Have Spent Last Night in Jail After Bail|author=Karen Freifeld, Chris Dolmetsch and Don Jeffrey|date=20 May 2011|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many programs also allow the convict to leave their residence during regular, pre-approved times in order to carry out general household errands, such as food shopping and laundry. Offenders may have to respond to communications from a higher authority to verify that they are at home when required to be. Exceptions are often made to allow visitors to visit the offender.&lt;ref&gt;Mele, Christopher. (2005). ''Civil Penalties, Social Consequences.'' Routledge. p. 139. {{ISBN|978-0-415-94823-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The types of house arrest vary in severity according to the requirements of the court order. A [[curfew]] may restrict an offender to their house at certain times, usually during hours of darkness. "Home confinement" or detention requires an offender to remain at home at all times, apart from the above-mentioned exceptions. The most serious level of house arrest is "home incarceration", under which an offender is restricted to their residence 24 hours a day/7 days a week, except for court-approved treatment programs, court appearances, and medical appointments.&lt;ref name=lev/&gt;

In some exceptional cases, it is possible for a person to be placed under house arrest without [[Trial (law)|trial]] or [[Lawyer|legal representation]], and subject to restrictions on their associates.&lt;ref&gt;Jupp, James; Nieuwenhuysen, John; Dawson, Emma. (2007). ''Social Cohesion in Australia.'' Cambridge University Press. p. 183. {{ISBN|978-0-521-70943-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries this type of detention without trial has been criticized for breaching the offender's [[human rights|human right]] to a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4715478.stm "Q&amp;A: Terrorism laws"]. BBC News Online. July 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In countries with authoritarian systems of government, the government may use such measures to stifle dissent.

==Using technology for enforcement==
In some countries, house arrest is often enforced through the use of technology products or services.  One method is an electronic sensor locked around the offender's ankle (technically called an [[ankle monitor]], also referred to as a [[tether]]). The electronic sensor transmits a [[GPS]] signal to a base handset. The base handset is connected to a police station or for-profit monitoring service.

If the offender goes too far from their home, the violation is recorded, and the police will be notified. To discourage tampering, many ankle monitors detect attempted removal.  The monitoring service is often contracted out to private companies, which assign employees to electronically monitor many convicts simultaneously. If a violation occurs the unit signals the office or officer in charge immediately, depending on the severity of the violation. The officer will either call or verify the participant's whereabouts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaltechnologies-2000.com/?page_id=459{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The monitoring service notifies a convict's probation officer. The electronic surveillance together with frequent contact with their probation officer and checks by the security guards provides for a secure environment.

Another method of ensuring house arrest compliance is achieved through the use of automated calling services that require no human contact to check on the offender. Random calls are made to the residence. The  respondent's answer is recorded and compared automatically to the offender's voice pattern. Authorities are notified only if the call is not answered or if the recorded answer does not match the offender's voice pattern.

[[Electronic tagging|Electronic monitoring]] is considered a highly economical alternative to the cost of imprisoning offenders. In many states or jurisdictions, the convict is often required to pay for the monitoring as part of his or her sentence.

===Italy===
In Italy, house arrest (in Italian ''arresti domiciliari'') is a common practice of [[Remand (detention)|detaining suspects]], as an alternative to detention in a correctional facility, and is also commonly practiced on those felons who are close to the end of their prison terms, or for those whose health condition does not allow residence in a correctional facility, except some particular cases of extremely dangerous persons. As per article 284 of the Italian Penal Procedure Code, house arrest is imposed by a judge, who orders the suspect to stay confined in his house, home, residence, private property, or any other place of cure or assistance where he/she may be housed at the moment. When necessary, the judge may also forbid any contact between the subject and any person other than those who cohabit with him/her or who assist him/her. If the subject is unable to take care of his/her life necessities or if he/she is in conditions of absolute poverty, the judge may authorize him/her to leave his/her home for the strict necessary time to take care of said needs or to exercise a job. The prosecuting authorities and law enforcement can check at any moment whether the subject, who is ''[[de facto]]'' considered in state of detention, is complying with the order; violation of house arrest terms is immediately followed by transfer to a correctional facility. House arrests cannot be applied to a subject that has been found guilty of [[Prison escape|escape]] within the previous five years.

Notable cases:
* [[Erich Priebke]], former [[SS]] captain, condemned for war crimes ([[Ardeatine massacre]] in Rome on 24 March 1944, when 335 Italian civilians were killed by Nazi force of occupation) to life imprisonment in 1996, spent under house arrest for the last part of his life, from 1998 to 2013 (when he died age of 100).
* [[Adriano Sofri]], journalist and former far left political leader, convicted in 1997 for the murder of Police Officer [[Luigi Calabresi]] (1972), spent under house arrest, for health reasons, the period between 2005 and 2012.
* [[Silvia Baraldini]], activist of [[Black Liberation Army]] in the US (sentenced to 43 years by Federal Court under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) for conspiring to commit two armed robberies, driving a secondary getaway car during the prison break of murder convict and fellow political activist [[Assata Shakur]], and contempt of court), transferred to Italy in 1999, spent the sentence on house arrest from 2001 to 2006, for health reasons.
* Giovanni Scattone and Salvatore Ferraro, convicted for manslaughter of [[Marta Russo]], spent a period of their sentence under house arrest and community service.

===New Zealand===
At sentencing, the judge may sentence an offender to home detention where they would otherwise receive a short-term prison sentence (i.e. two years or less). Home detention sentences range from 14 days and 12 months; offenders are confined to their approved residence 24 hours a day and may only leave with the permission of their probation officer.

Electronic monitoring equipment is extensively used by the [[New Zealand Department of Corrections]] to ensure that convicted offenders subject to home detention remain within approved areas. This takes the form of a Global Positioning System tracker fitted to the offender's ankle and monitoring units located at their residence and place of employment. {{as of|2015}} over three thousand persons were serving home detention sentences under GPS surveillance.

*[[Phil Rudd]], two-time drummer with Australian rock legends [[AC/DC]], was sentenced to eight months' home detention at his waterfront mansion in [[Tauranga]] for charges relating to [[methamphetamine]] possession and making [[death threats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/acdcs-phil-rudd-sentenced-to-house-detention-for-eight-months-201597|title=AC/DC's Phil Rudd Sentenced to House Detention for Eight Months|work=Us Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
* [[Shehu Shagari]], [[President of Nigeria]] was placed under house arrest on December 31, 1983, following a military coup which ousted his government (see: [[Nigerian Second Republic]]).
* [[Muhammadu Buhari|General Muhammadu Buhari]], [[President of Nigeria|Military Head of State]] was confined to his residence following the palace coup which ejected him from office.
* [[Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola|MKO Abiola]], was placed under house arrest after he declared himself the rightful winner of the 1993 [[Nigerian Third Republic|presidential elections]], against the wishes of the [[Ibrahim Babangida]] military junta. He was detained for five years until his death in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2836.htm Background note: Nigeria]. U.S. Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
* [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Pakistan|9th]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime minister]] and [[List of Presidents of Pakistan|4th]] [[President of Pakistan]]. He was deposed in 1977 in a [[military coup]] – ''[[Operation Fair Play]]'' – led by [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]] General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]. Bhutto  was put to trial and hanged later in 1979.
* [[Navaz Sharif]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Pakistan|12th]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime minister]]. Sharif was deposed in 1999 in a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état|similar military coup]] led by Chief of Army Staff and [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (Pakistan)|Chairman]] of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee]] General [[Pervez Musharraf]]. Sharif was put in a forced trial, but due to foreign pressure exerted by [[Saudi Arabia]] and the United States, Sharif was exiled to Saudi Arabia which narrowly spared his life to face the same fate as of Bhutto. In 2010, Sharif was again put in house arrest by President Asif Ali Zardari when he announced a long march to support the [[Lawyers' Movement]]. However, Sharif broke the house arrest in his vehicle and drove to Islamabad to join the Movement.
* [[Imran Khan]], former captain of [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan cricket team]] and chairman of [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf|''Pakistan Movement of Justice'']] (PTI), was placed under house arrest at the declaration of a [[2007 Pakistani state of emergency|state of emergency]] by Chief of Army Staff General [[Pervaz Musharraf]] on November 3, 2007.
*[[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] [[Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry]], [[Chief Justice of Pakistan]], was put under house arrest on November 3, 2007 by General [[Pervaz Musharraf]]. His arrest led to [[Movement to impeach Pervez Musharraf|mass protest]] and [[Lawyers' Movement]].
*Dr. [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], Pakistan's top scientist and founder of Pakistan's Gas-centrifuge programme of the Pakistan's nuclear device was also put under house arrest for a long time by General Pervez Musharraf. Khan was forced to attend continuous military debriefings by Musharraf and was put in house arrest for a long time. Later, he was released from imprisonment in 2008 by the order of [[Islamabad High Court]] and the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]]. Although the order has not been fully acted upon, he is legally out of house arrest.

===Roman Catholic Church===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6680">{{Euthanasia}}

'''Involuntary euthanasia''' occurs when [[euthanasia]] is performed on a person who would be able to provide [[informed consent]], but does not, either because they do not want to die, or because they were not asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=  Jackson | first = Jennifer | year = 2006 | title = Ethics in medicine | publisher = [[Polity (publisher)|Polity]] | isbn = 0-7456-2569-X | page = 137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Involuntary euthanasia is contrasted with [[voluntary euthanasia]] (euthanasia performed with the patient's consent) and [[non-voluntary euthanasia]] (when the patient is unable to give informed consent, for example when a patient is [[coma]]tose or a [[child euthanasia|child]]). Involuntary euthanasia is widely opposed and is regarded as a crime in all legal jurisdictions. Reference to it or fear of it is sometimes used as a reason for not changing laws relating to other forms of euthanasia.&lt;ref name="Harris-2001"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Harris | first1 = NM. | title = The euthanasia debate. | journal = J R Army Med Corps | volume = 147 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–70 |date=Oct 2001 | doi =  10.1136/jramc-147-03-22| pmid = 11766225 |quote=It is the occurrence of involuntary euthanasia which forms one of the main arguments against legalisation. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapple-2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Chapple | first1 = A. | last2 = Ziebland | first2 = S. | last3 = McPherson | first3 = A. | last4 = Herxheimer | first4 = A. | title = What people close to death say about euthanasia and assisted suicide: a qualitative study | journal = J Med Ethics | volume = 32 | issue = 12 | pages = 706–10 |date=Dec 2006 | doi = 10.1136/jme.2006.015883 | pmid = 17145910  | pmc = 2563356 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of involuntary euthanasia==

===United States===

Euthanasia became a subject of public discussion in the United States at the turn of the 20th century. Felix Adler, a prominent educator and scholar, issued the first authoritative call in 1891 for the provision of lethal drugs to terminally ill patients who requested to die. In 1906, Ohio considered a law to legalize such a form of euthanasia, but it did not make it out of committee. While much of the debate focused on voluntary euthanasia, other calls for involuntary euthanasia were vocalized as well. In 1900, W. Duncan McKim, a New York physician and author published a book titled “Heredity and Human Progress.” This book suggested that people with severe inherited defects, including mentally handicapped people, epileptics, habitual drunks and criminals, should be given a quick and painless death by carbonic gas.&lt;ref name=Cheyfitz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheyfitz|first=Kirk|title=Who Decides? The Connecting Thread of Euthanasia, Eugenics, and Doctor-Assisted Suicide|journal=Omega|year=1999–2000|volume=40|issue=1|pages=5–16|doi=10.2190/djfu-aawp-m3l4-4alp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1938, the National Society for the Legalization of Euthanasia was formed, and was renamed the Euthanasia Society of America (ESA) later that year. It advocated for the legalization of euthanasia in the United States, primarily by lobbying state legislators. Many prominent ESA members advocated for involuntary euthanasia of people with mental disabilities, including Ann Mitchell, a former asylum patient and main financial supporter of the ESA until her suicide in 1942. Ann Mitchell is also credited with structuring the ESA as a eugenics project. ESA’s first president was Charles Potter, an ex-Baptist minister who advocated for coercive eugenic sterilization and involuntary euthanasia to eliminate undesirable defective people from society.&lt;ref name=Dowbiggin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dowbiggin|first=Ian|title="A Rational Coalition": Euthanasia, Eugenics, and Birth Control in America, 1940-1970|journal=The Journal of Policy History|year=2002|volume=14|issue=3|pages=223–260|doi=10.1353/jph.2002.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ESA initially advocated for both voluntary and involuntary euthanasia of people with severe disabilities. The organization soon realized that involuntary euthanasia had negative connotations, particularly its association with [[Aktion T4|the Nazis' "euthanasia" program]], and began advocating for voluntary euthanasia exclusively.&lt;ref name=Dowbiggin/&gt; The ESA continues to exist today.&lt;ref name=Cheyfitz/&gt;{{Better source|reason=no longer a timely source, I can't find contemporary evidence of this group's activities or presence|date=May 2014}}

===World War II Germany===
{{main|Action T4}}
[[File:Hadamar 012.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Gas chamber]] in [[Hadamar Euthanasia Centre]]]]
Adolf Hitler enacted the [[Aktion T4|Aktion T4 program]] in October 1939 to kill "incurably ill, physically or mentally disabled, emotionally distraught, and elderly people". The Aktion T4 program was also designed to kill those who were deemed "inferior and threatening to the well being of the Aryan race". This program was also designed as part of a larger, "Final Solution" eugenics program. Within months of enactment, the Nazis expanded its definition of who could be killed to include those who were of a certain ethnicity as well as class. Six killing centers were established for T4, one of the most notable being the [[Hadamar Euthanasia Centre]]. At these centers, people deemed handicapped or "unfit" by "medical experts" were put to death. For example, gas chambers were disguised to look like showers and some people (particularly children) were starved to death. Often at these centers, the victims were murdered together in [[gas chamber]]s using carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name=Strous /&gt; The meticulous research undertaken by the Nazis on the victims, was used as a prototype for extermination camps such as [[Auschwitz]] and [[Treblinka]] later on in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Young |first=Rachel |title=The "Euthanasia" of People with Disabilities in Nazi Germany: Harbinger of the  "Final Solution"}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2015}} Approximately 200,000 people were murdered in the six years of the T4 program.

'''John Joseph Hainkel Jr.''' (March 24, 1938 &amp;ndash; April 15, 2005), was a legislator from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], who died in office after thirty-seven years of service. He was the first person in his state and the second in [[United States]] history to have been elected as both [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of his [[Louisiana House of Representatives|state House of Representatives]] and President of his [[Louisiana Senate|state Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Clarence C. Aycock|Clarence C. "Taddy" Aycock]] of [[Franklin, Louisiana|Franklin]], the seat of [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]], was both Speaker and, as [[lieutenant governor]], was ''ex officio'' President of the state Senate, under the state Constitution of 1921. In 1974, Louisiana adopted a new state Constitution, which mandated that the President of the state Senate be elected by the senators, thus eliminating the lieutenant governor's ''ex officio'' role as Senate president. The lieutenant governor has since become largely the director of state tourism, recreation, and culture.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mallory Horne]] of [[Florida]] was the first to have done so. [http://ncsl.typepad.com/the_thicket/2011/10/legislators-who-have-served-as-speaker-and-top-senate-leader.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Hainkel graduated in 1956 from the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[De La Salle High School (New Orleans, Louisiana)|De La Salle High School]] and then [[Tulane University]] and [[Tulane University School of Law]], all in New Orleans. In addition to being known as a [[raconteur]], Hainkel was a trial and appellate [[Lawyer|attorney]]. In 1967, he was the third partner in Porteous, Toledano, Hainkel, and Johnson, then the second oldest law firm in Louisiana specializing throughout its history in insurance defense. Law partner [[Ben Toledano]], like Hainkel, left the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to run in his case, unsuccessfully, as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for [[mayor of New Orleans]] in 1970 and the [[United States Senate]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phjlaw.com/firm-overview/history/|title=History of Porteous, Hainkel &amp; Johnson LLP|publisher=phjlaw.com|accessdate=June 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hainkel was first elected in 1968 as a Democrat to the Louisiana House. His service hence dated back to the second term of [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[John McKeithen]]. Like many other Louisiana Democrats over time, he wound up switching to the more [[American conservatism|conservative]] Republican Party. He originally represented a compact, affluent Uptown New Orleans House district. At the time of his death, Hainkel's legislative service had begun before ten then-serving Louisiana state legislators had been born.

==Legislative reformer==
New to the legislature, Hainkel joined a group of reformers who came to be known as the "Young Turks," including his predecessor as Speaker, [[E. L. Henry|Edgerton L. "Bubba" Henry]], a Democrat from [[Jonesboro, Louisiana|Jonesboro]] in [[Jackson Parish]]. When [[David C. Treen]] became the state's first GOP governor since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] in the 1979 election, Hainkel, then a conservative Democrat, was Treen's choice to serve as Speaker of the House. He served in that post from 1980 to 1984, but he was replaced by Representative [[John Alario]], a [[Westwego, Louisiana|Westwego]] ([[Jefferson Parish]]) Democrat when Governor [[Edwin Washington Edwards]] won a third term in the 1983 [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] by unseating Treen.

Alario switched parties for the 2011 elections in Louisiana. On October 25, 2011, Governor [[Bobby Jindal]] indicated Alario as the governor's preference for the Louisiana Senate presidency. On election by his senatorial colleagues, Alario joined Hainkel as the only persons in Louisiana and the fourth in the United States to have been presiding officers of both houses of their state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2011/10/gov_b0obby_jindal_endorses_wes.html|title=Ed Anderson, "Gov. Bobby Jindal endorses Sen. John Alario as his choice for Senate president", October 25, 2011|publisher=nola.com|accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Libby Mitchell]] had accomplished the same feat in Maine in between Hainkel and Alario. [http://ncsl.typepad.com/the_thicket/2011/10/legislators-who-have-served-as-speaker-and-top-senate-leader.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventy-four legislative sessions that he attended, Hainkel was a champion of a more independent legislature. After joining the "Young Turks" movement of the 1970s, he became known as strong foe of Governor Edwin Edwards on [[gambling]] issues.

Hainkel was an opponent of the proposed [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA), which was rejected in a key House committee in 1976. When the ERA failed to gain ratification after an extended deadline, Hainkel, then Speaker, addressed a gathering of the opponents held in Baton Rouge on June 30, 1982. Hainkel noted that many states "unthinkingly" ratified the ERA when it passed Congress early in 1972 because that "was the thing to do" then. Hainkel said that he objected to placing accession rights and family law subservient to federal law. "Already in this state, credit laws have been changed, head and master changed to joint management, and through commerce and economics, we've addressed ourselves to problems. We've had increased equality on the basis of sex, but we've had it in the proper form, handled in the statutes of this state," Hainkel said.

Hainkel was elected to the Senate in 1987, 1991, 1995, 1999 and 2003. He served as that body's president during the second term of Republican former Governor [[Murphy J. Foster Jr.|Murphy J. "Mike" Foster Jr.]], from 2000 to 2004.

==A colorful lawmaker==
With his front-row seat in the chamber, Hainkel was one of the legislature's most colorful figures. He wound up his career as a "bridge-building" Republican who put the interests of his state ahead of party. His Senate district encompassed only a sliver of his original Uptown base but included portions of Jefferson, [[St. Tammany Parish|St. Tammany]], and [[Tangipahoa Parish|Tangipahoa]] parishes, including [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]]'s [[Southeastern Louisiana University]] for which he became a legislative champion.

"A New Orleanian by birth, demeanor, appearance and conduct, he was really a good ol' boy in lifelong disguise," recalled then State Senator [[Jay Dardenne]], a [[Baton Rouge]] [[Rockefeller Republican|Moderate Republican]], another of Hainkel's close legislative allies.

In the words of Ed Anderson of the ''New Orleans Times-Picayune'', "Hainkel was a legislative leader and deal-broker who could be moved to tears when recognizing an old friend or meeting a disabled child."

Anderson continued, "He moved at ease between the world of gentility and the tobacco-chewing country store crowd. He frequently wore madras clothes with mismatched shirts, whether he was in the halls of power or at his St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church parish.

"He knew almost all the roadside stands, bars, and restaurants in the district. He had a flair for making a point during debate, punctuating his speeches with animated arm-flailing and near-screams. He once brought raw [[pork chop]]s to the Senate floor when he went on a tear against '[[pork barrel]]-spending' in a bill."

Anderson added that Hainkel "had a joie de vivre.... Some viewed him as a [[wikt:curmudgeon|curmudgeon]], but he had a softer side and was always ready to party or enjoy a cookout, a parade, a fair, or a festival. He embraced enemies as friends after a day of legislative battle, literally -- sometimes hugging them as his hoarse laugh filled a room," much as [[Tip O'Neill]] sometimes told President [[Ronald Reagan]], whom he opposed on most legislative matters, that they could have a drink together whenever it was after 6 p.m.

Hainkel was a chef in the Louisiana tradition but was most famous for his homemade fig icecream.

==Hainkel's death==
Hainkel's longtime law partner, William Porteous, said that Hainkel had been at a meeting near Poplarville in [[Pearl River County, Mississippi|Pearl River County]] in southwestern Mississippi on April 14, 2005, with other Republican lawmakers and was found dead in his bed the next morning. "They were at a camp. He just didn't wake up," Porteous explained.

A coroner's report revealed that Hainkel [[asphyxiation|asphyxiated]]. Apparently, fluid blocked his breathing passages as he slept and entered his lungs. (He did not succumb to [[heart failure]], as originally thought.) He had spent his last evening cooking for friends, eating, and recounting political "war stories."

"I couldn't picture John Hainkel going out any other way," said then Senator [[Tom Schedler]], a [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]] Republican and one of his closest friends, who later became Louisiana secretary of state.

Hainkel, who was [[divorced]], was survived by three children and five grandchildren.

==Southeastern Louisiana University==
Hainkel, although a graduate of Tulane University, also took a special interest in [[Southeastern Louisiana University]], which, as a public institution, he represented as state senator. His Senate District 6 straddled [[Lake Pontchartrain]], causing Hainkel to quip that he represented more fish than people. Hainkel originated the '''Pontchartrain Cup''', a trophy traded between Tulane and Southeastern on the basis of which team wins the annual baseball game.

Hainkel, more than anyone else, was responsible for gaining over $5 million of state funding for renovation of the Columbia Theatre for the Performing Arts in the Historic District of [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] and the Columbia's acquisition by [[Southeastern Louisiana University]].  The operatic performance room within the spacious theatre is named Hainkel Hall, and a plaque commemorating Senator Hainkel appears prominently in the lobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiatheatre.org/aboutHainkel.php|title=Hainkel profile on the Columbia Theatre web site.|website=Columbiatheatre.org|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hainkel was honored in 1996 in Hammond with [[Southeastern Louisiana University]]'s "Golden Ambassador Award," a prestigious designation given for "outstanding service, achievement, and/or humanitarian efforts."

==Legacy and honors==
In June 2006, a bust of Hainkel was placed in the rotunda of the [[Louisiana State Capitol]].  The Senate's briefing room in the Capitol has also been named for Hainkel.  ''[[Gambit Weekly]]'' noted, "With theater-style seating and large plasma monitors, the John Hainkel Room is among the most luxurious in the Capitol."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/the-2005-legislative-yearbook/Content?oid=1244476|title=The 2005 Legislative Yearbook|first=Jeremy|last=Alford|website=Gambit|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Hainkel's death, Congress, on a motion from Louisiana Republican [[Bobby Jindal]] (who would later be elected governor of Louisiana), declared that Hainkel's death "is a loss for me and for all Louisiana. He was a good friend and one of the most supportive people I know. He was always ready to lend a helping and guiding hand, whatever the situation may be." Later, at Jindal's request, Congress voted to rename the post office in [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] to honor Hainkel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/record.xpd?id=109-h20050627-22] {{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hainkel is also the eponym of the [http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/?ID=106 John J. Hainkel Jr. Home and Rehab Center], a New Orleans unit of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. Hainkel championed funding for the facility during his time in the Senate.

''The Picayune'''s Anderson noted that Hainkel loved traditions: his birthday at a Tulane baseball game, for instance, and frequent parties for Tulane, LSU, and Southeastern sports contests, in New Orleans, Baton Rouge, or Hammond. Anderson called him a "one-man tourism bureau" who promoted his love of Louisiana wherever he went. "His politicking was one-on-one: stumping the corner stores, roadside stands and restaurants of his district, shucking [[oyster]]s at a school fair or tossing [[pumpkin]]s in a parade."

Senator [[Robert J. Barham]], an [[Oak Ridge, Louisiana|Oak Ridge]] ([[Morehouse Parish]]) Republican, said of his fallen colleague: "It will be surreal when you show up for the session and look for John Hainkel, and he won't be there."

"John Hainkel was comfortable in the package God gave him," said Jay Dardenne, who was elected Louisiana secretary of state in a special election on September 30, 2006, and subsequently became lieutenant governor and commissioner of administration.

The New Orleans Chapter of the Alliance for Good Government awarded him their Legislator of the Year award more than once and with their Special Award in 1983. The Associated Builders and Contractors of Louisiana named him Man of the Year in 1972; he was honored with the Louisiana/Mississippi Associated Press [[Margaret Dixon]] Award in 1980; as Alumnus of the Year of Tulane University, and as Alumnus of the Year of De La Salle High School. In 1988, Senator Hainkel was chosen Legislator of the Year by the Louisiana Restaurant Association. In 1999, Senator Hainkel was honored by the Tangipahoa Parish School Board for his leadership in providing for funding for public education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wtcno.org/programs/2001/hainkel-03-02.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204092457/http://www.wtcno.org/programs/2001/hainkel-03-02.htm |archive-date=2008-12-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hainkel was succeeded in the Louisiana Senate by fellow Republican [[Julie Quinn]], who won a  special election [[runoff election|runoff]] in July 2005 against another Republican, [[Diane Winston]], a state representative from [[Covington, Louisiana|Covington]]. After the district was considerably altered in the 2011 redistricting, Quinn did not seek reelection.

In 2002, Hainkel was inducted into the [[Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame]] in [[Winnfield, Louisiana|Winnfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofwinnfield.com/museum.html |title=Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame |publisher=cityofwinnfield.com |accessdate=August 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703054258/http://cityofwinnfield.com/museum.html |archivedate=July 3, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of the '''most lethal battles fought by the military of the United States of America'''. This list shows battles, sieges and offensives where the number of U.S. soldiers killed was higher than 1000. The battles that reached that number of deaths in the field are so far limited to the [[American Civil War]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], [[Korean War]] and one battle during the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Tet Offensive]] (January 30 to September 23, 1968). The battle that resulted in the most U.S. military deaths was the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]] (September 26 to November 11, 1918) where 26,277 soldiers were killed fighting against the [[German Empire]]. The bloodiest single day in American history was during the [[Battle of Antietam]] when 3,654 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed on September 17, 1862.&lt;ref name= "Tucker p. 903"&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|2013|p=903}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| Union and Confederate numbers added together|group="A"}}&lt;ref name="History.com p."&gt;{{harvnb|History.com|2017|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, for the United States military specifically, the bloodiest single day is June 6, 1944.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The origins of the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] can be traced to the Americans' fight for independence from their former colonial power, Great Britain, in the [[American Revolutionary War|War for independence]] (1775–83). The three bloodiest conflicts have been [[American Civil War]] (1861–65), [[World War I]] (1917–1918) and [[World War II]] (1941–45). Other significant conflicts involving the United States ordered by casualties include,[[Korean War]] (1950–1953), [[Vietnam War]] (1964–1973), the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)]] and various conflicts in the Middle East. For most of its existence, America has been [[List of wars involving the United States|involved in one or another military conflict]].&lt;ref name="Kelly p."&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|2017|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[Casualty (person)|Casualty]]'' in warfare can often be confusing. It often does not refer to those that are killed on the battlefield; rather, it refers to those who can no longer fight. This can include disabled by injuries, disabled by [[psychological trauma]], [[prisoner of war|captured]], [[desertion|deserted]], or [[missing in action|missing]]. A casualty is just a soldier who is no longer available for the immediate battle or campaign, the major consideration in combat; the number of casualties is simply the number of members of a unit who are not available for duty. For example, during the [[Seven Days Battles]] in the [[American Civil War]] (June 25 to July 1, 1862) there were 5,228 killed, 23,824 wounded and 7,007 missing or taken prisoner for a total of 36,059 casualties.&lt;ref name= "Tucker p. 892"&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|2013|p=892}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| Union and Confederate numbers added together|group="A"}}  The word ''casualty'' has been used in a military context since at least 1513.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed gives a 1513 reference for military casualty, and an 1844 reference for civilian use&lt;/ref&gt; In this article the numbers killed refer to those [[killed in action]], killed by [[disease]] or someone who died from their wounds.

'''''Magnolia''''' is a large [[genus]] of about 210&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The number of species in the genus ''Magnolia'' depends on the taxonomic view that one takes up. Recent molecular and [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] research shows that former genera ''Talauma'', ''Dugandiodendron'', ''Manglietia'', ''Michelia'', ''Elmerrillia'', ''Kmeria'', ''Parakmeria'', ''Pachylarnax'' (and a small number of monospecific genera) all belong within the same genus, ''Magnolia'' s.l. (s.l. = ''sensu lato'': 'in a broad sense', as opposed to s.s. = ''sensu stricto'': 'in a narrow sense'). The genus ''Magnolia'' s.s. contains about 120 species. See the section [[Magnolia#Nomenclature and classification|Nomenclature and classification]] in this article.&lt;/ref&gt; [[flowering plant]] [[species]] in the subfamily [[Magnolioideae]] of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Magnoliaceae]]. It is named after [[French people|French]] botanist [[Pierre Magnol]].

''Magnolia'' is an ancient genus. Appearing before [[bee]]s did, the flowers are theorized to have evolved to encourage [[pollination]] by [[beetle]]s. To avoid damage from pollinating beetles, the [[carpel]]s of ''Magnolia'' flowers are extremely tough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Convergent  evolution and adaptive  radiation of  beetle-pollinated  angiosperms |last=Bernhardt |first=P. |work=Plant Systematics and Evolution |volume=222 |pages=293–320 |date=2000 |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~dbarring/241/bernhardt2000.pdf |doi=10.1007/bf00984108 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223060505/http://www.uvm.edu/~dbarring/241/bernhardt2000.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fossil]]ised specimens of ''M. acuminata'' have been found dating to 20 million years ago, and of plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae date to 95 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crane |first=P.R. |date=1988 |chapter=The phylogenetic position and fossil history of the Magnoliaceae |editor1-last=Hunt |editor1-first=David R. |title=Magnolias and their allies: Proceedings of an International Symposium, Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham, Surrey, U.K., 12-13 April 1996 |location=Milbourne Port |page=21 |isbn=9780951723487 |oclc=40781614}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another aspect of ''Magnolia'' considered to represent an ancestral state is that the flower bud is enclosed in a [[bract]] rather than in sepals; the [[perianth]] parts are undifferentiated and called [[tepals]] rather than distinct [[sepal]]s and [[petal]]s. ''Magnolia'' shares the tepal characteristic with several other flowering plants near the [[Basal (phylogenetics)|base]] of the [[flowering plant]] lineage such as ''[[Amborella]]'' and ''[[Nymphaea]]'' (as well as with many more recently derived plants such as ''[[Lilium]]'').

The natural range of ''Magnolia'' species is a [[disjunct distribution]], with a main centre in east and southeast [[Asia]] and a secondary centre in eastern [[North America]], [[Central America]], the [[West Indies]], and some species in [[South America]].

===History===

====Early====
[[File:Magnòlia a Verbania.JPG|thumb|''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'']]
[[File:Magnolia flowers (Wiesbaden, Germany).JPG|thumb|Magnolia flowers in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany]]
The name ''Magnolia'' first appeared in 1703 in the ''[[Genera]]''&lt;ref name=Plumier&gt;Plumier, C. (1703) ''Nova plantarum Americanarum genera''. Paris. [New genera of American plants].&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Charles Plumier]] (1646–1704), for a flowering tree from the island of [[Martinique]] (''talauma''). English botanist [[William Sherard]], who studied botany in Paris under [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]], a pupil of [[Magnol]], was most probably the first after Plumier to adopt the genus name ''Magnolia''. He was at least responsible for the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] part of [[Johann Jacob Dillenius]]'s ''Hortus Elthamensis''&lt;ref&gt;Dillenius, J.J. (1732), ''Hortus Elthamensis, seu plantarum rariorum quas in horto suo Elthami in Cantio coluit vir ornamentissimus et praestantissimus Jacobus Sherard''. London [The garden of Eltham, or rather about the rare plants that the most distinguished and prominent man Jacob Sherard grows in his garden in Eltham in Kent].&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Mark Catesby]]'s ''Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands''.&lt;ref&gt;Catesby, M. (1730), ''The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands, containing the figures of birds, beasts, fishes, serpents, insects and plants, Vol. 1.'' London.&lt;/ref&gt; These were the first works after Plumier's ''Genera'' that used the name ''Magnolia'', this time for some species of [[Angiosperms|flowering trees]] from [[temperate]] North America. The species that Plumier originally named ''Magnolia'' was later described as ''[[Annona dodecapetala]]'' by [[Lamarck]],&lt;ref&gt;Lamarck, J.B.P.A. de (1786), ''Encyclopédie Méthodique Botanique'', tome second: 127. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been named ''Magnolia plumieri'' and ''Talauma plumieri'' (and still a number of other names) but is now known as ''Magnolia dodecapetala''.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Under the rule of priority, the first name that is validly published in Linnaeus' ''Species Plantarum'' (1 May 1753) or any other work of any other [[botanist]] after that, takes precedence over later names. Plumier's name was not a [[binomen]] and moreover published before ''Species Plantarum'', so it has no status. The first binomen published after 1753 was Lamarck's ''Annona dodecapetala'' (1786). ''Magnolia plumieri'' (1788) was published on a later date by Schwartz, and is treated as a later synonym, as are ''Magnolia fatiscens'' (1817; Richard), ''Talauma caerulea'' (Jaume St-Hilaire 1805) and ''Magnolia linguifolia'' (1822).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Linnaeus]], who was familiar with Plumier's ''Genera'', adopted the genus name ''Magnolia'' in 1735 in his first edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', without a description, but with a reference to Plumier's work. In 1753, he took up Plumier's ''Magnolia'' in the first edition of ''[[Species Plantarum]]''. There he described a [[monotypic]] genus, with the sole species being ''[[Magnolia virginiana]]''. Since Linnaeus never saw a herbarium specimen (if there ever was one) of Plumier's ''Magnolia'' and had only his description and a rather poor picture at hand, he must have taken it for the same plant which was described by Catesby in his 1730 ''Natural History of Carolina''.  He placed it in the [[synonymy]] of ''Magnolia virginiana'' var. ''fœtida'', the [[taxon]] now known as ''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]''. Under ''Magnolia virginiana'' Linnaeus described five varieties (''glauca'', ''fœtida'', ''grisea'', ''tripetala'', and ''acuminata''). In the tenth edition of ''Systema Naturae'' (1759), he merged ''grisea'' with ''glauca'', and raised the four remaining varieties to species status.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;''Magnolia glauca'' has the same type specimen as ''Magnolia virginiana'' and as the latter is the first valid name, the species is now called ''Magnolia virginiana'' (sweetbay magnolia). Var. ''fœtida'' was renamed ''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'', which is legitimate as the epithet ''fœtida'' only has priority in its rank of variety. ''Magnolia grandiflora'' is the southern magnolia. ''[[Magnolia tripetala]]'' (umbrella magnolia) and ''[[Magnolia acuminata]]'' (cucumber tree) are still recognized as species.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 18th century, botanists and plant hunters exploring Asia began to name and describe the ''Magnolia'' species from China and Japan. The first Asiatic species to be described by western botanists were ''[[Magnolia denudata]]'' and ''[[Magnolia liliiflora]]'',&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Under these names the species were described by [[Desrousseaux]] in [[Lamarck]]'s ''Encyclopédie Méthodique Botanique'', tome troisieme (1792): 675. In the beginning of the 20th century, descriptions which seemed to represent the same species, were found in a work of the French naturalist [[Pierre Joseph Buchoz|P.J. Buc'hoz]], ''Plantes nouvellement découvertes'' (1779), under the names ''Lassonia heptapeta'' and ''Lassonia quinquepeta''. In 1934, the English botanist J.E. Dandy argued that these names had priority over the names by which both species had been known for over a century and hence from then on ''Magnolia denudata'' had to be named ''Magnolia heptapeta'', ''Magnolia liliiflora'' should be changed into ''Magnolia quinquepeta''. After a lengthy debate, specialist taxonomists decided that the Buc'hoz's names were based on [[chimaeras]] (pictures constructed of elements of different species), and as Buc'hoz did not cite or preserve herbarium specimens, his names were ruled not to be acceptable.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Magnolia coco'' and ''[[Michelia figo|Magnolia figo]]''.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;These species were published as ''Liriodendron coco'' and ''Liriodendron figo'' by J. de Loureiro in ''Flora Cochinchinensis'' (1790) and later (1817) transferred to ''Magnolia'' by [[A. P. de Candolle]]. ''Magnolia figo'' was soon after transferred to the genus ''Michelia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after that, in 1794, [[Carl Peter Thunberg]] collected and described ''Magnolia obovata'' from Japan and at roughly the same time ''Magnolia kobus'' was also first collected.&lt;ref&gt;''Magnolia kobus'' only received its name in 1814, when it was validly published by A.P. de Candolle. There has been much confusion about earlier attempts to validly publish this species, especially because descriptions and type specimens did not match.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent====
With the number of species increasing, the genus was divided into the two subgenera ''Magnolia'' and ''Yulania''. ''Magnolia'' contains the American evergreen species ''M. grandiflora'', which is of [[horticulture|horticultural]] importance, especially in the southeastern [[United States]], and ''M. virginiana'', the type species. ''Yulania'' contains several [[deciduous]] Asiatic species, such as ''M. denudata'' and ''M. kobus'', which have become horticulturally important in their own right and as parents in hybrids. Classified in ''Yulania'', is also the American deciduous ''M. acuminata'' (cucumber tree), which has recently attained greater status as the parent responsible for the yellow flower colour in many new hybrids.

Relations in the family Magnoliaceae have been puzzling taxonomists for a long time. Because the family is quite old and has survived many geological events (such as ice ages, mountain formation, and continental drift), its distribution has become scattered. Some species or groups of species have been isolated for a long time, while others could stay in close contact. To create divisions in the family (or even within the genus ''Magnolia''), solely based upon morphological characters, has proven to be a nearly impossible task.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;In 1927 J.E. Dandy accepted 10 genera in ''The genera of Magnoliaceae'', ''Kew Bulletin 1927'': 257-264. In 1984 Law Yuh-Wu proposed 15 in ''A preliminary study on the taxonomy of the family Magnoliaceae'', ''Acta Phytotaxonomica Sinica'' 22: 89-109; in 2004 even 16, in ''Magnolias of China''. This is not just about grouping some genera together where others do not; authors often choose different boundaries.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phylogenetic era====
By the end of the 20th century, [[DNA sequencing]] had become available as a method of large-scale research on [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic relationships]]. Several studies, including studies on many species in the family Magnoliaceae, were carried out to investigate relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Azuma | first1 = H. | last2 = Thien | first2 = L.B. | last3 = Kawano | first3 = S. | year = 1999 | title = Molecular phylogeny of ''Magnolia'' (Magnoliaceae) inferred from cpDNA sequences and evolutionary divergence of the floral scents | url = | journal = Journal of Plant Research | volume = 112 | issue = 1107| pages = 291–306 | doi = 10.1007/pl00013885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Azuma | first1 = H. | last2 = García-Franco | first2 = J.G. | last3 = Rico-Gray | first3 = V. | last4 = Thien | first4 = L.B. | year = 2001 | title = Molecular phylogeny of the Magnoliaceae: the biogeography of tropical and temperate disjunctions | url = | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 88 | issue = 12| pages = 2275–2285 | doi=10.2307/3558389 | pmid=21669660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = S. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2001 | title = Phylogenetic relationships in family Magnoliaceae inferred from ndhF sequences | url = | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 88 | issue = 4| pages = 717–728 | doi=10.2307/2657073| jstor = 2657073 }}&lt;/ref&gt; What these studies all revealed was that genus ''[[Michelia]]'' and ''Magnolia'' subgenus ''Yulania'' were far more closely allied to each other than either one of them was to ''Magnolia'' subgenus ''Magnolia''. These phylogenetic studies were supported by morphological data.&lt;ref&gt;Figlar, R.B. (2000), Proleptic branch initiation in ''Michelia'' and ''Magnolia'' subgenus ''Yulania'' provides basis for combinations in subfamily Magnolioideae. In: Liu Yu-hu et al., ''Proceedings of the International Symposium on the Family Magnoliaceae'': 14-25, Science Press, Beijing.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[nomenclature]] is supposed to reflect relationships, the situation with the species names in ''Michelia'' and ''Magnolia'' subgenus ''Yulania'' was undesirable. Taxonomically, three choices are available: '''1''' to join ''Michelia'' and ''Yulania'' species in a common genus, not being ''Magnolia'' (for which the name ''Michelia'' has priority), '''2''' to raise subgenus ''Yulania'' to generic rank, leaving ''Michelia'' names and subgenus ''Magnolia'' names untouched, or '''3''' to join ''Michelia'' with genus ''Magnolia'' into genus ''Magnolia'' [[sensu (taxonomy)|s.l.]] (a big genus). ''Magnolia'' subgenus ''Magnolia'' cannot be renamed because it contains ''M. virginiana'', the type species of the genus and of the family.
Not many ''Michelia'' species have so far become horticulturally or economically important, apart for their wood. Both subgenus ''Magnolia'' and subgenus ''Yulania'' include species of major horticultural importance, and a change of name would be very undesirable for many people, especially in the horticultural branch. In Europe, ''Magnolia'' even is more or less a synonym for ''Yulania'', since most of the cultivated species on this continent have ''Magnolia (Yulania) denudata'' as one of their parents. Most taxonomists who acknowledge close relations between ''Yulania'' and ''Michelia'' therefore support the third option and join ''Michelia'' with ''Magnolia''.

The same goes, ''mutatis mutandis'', for the (former) genera ''[[Talauma]]'' and ''Dugandiodendron'', which are then placed in subgenus ''Magnolia'', and genus ''[[Manglietia]]'', which could be joined with subgenus ''Magnolia'' or may even earn the status of an extra subgenus. ''[[Elmerrillia]]'' seems to be closely related to ''Michelia'' and ''Yulania'', in which case it will most likely be treated in the same way as ''Michelia'' is now. The precise nomenclatural status of small or monospecific genera like ''Kmeria'', ''Parakmeria'', ''Pachylarnax'', ''Manglietiastrum'', ''Aromadendron'', ''Woonyoungia'', ''Alcimandra'', ''Paramichelia'' and ''Tsoongiodendron'' remains uncertain. Taxonomists who merge ''Michelia'' into ''Magnolia'' tend to merge these small genera into ''Magnolia'' s.l. as well. Botanists do not yet agree on whether to recognize a big ''Magnolia'' or the different small genera. For example, ''Flora of China'' offers two choices: a large genus ''Magnolia'' which includes about 300 species, everything in the [[Magnoliaceae]] except ''[[Liriodendron]]'' (tulip tree), or 16 different genera, some of them recently split out or re-recognized, each of which contains up to 50 species.&lt;ref name="china"&gt;[http://efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=10530 4. Magnoliaceae], ''Flora of China''&lt;/ref&gt; The western co-author favors the big genus ''Magnolia'', whereas the Chinese recognize the different small genera.

===Subdivision===
Species of Magnolia are most commonly listed under three [[subgenus|subgenera]], 12 [[section (biology)|section]]s, and 13 subsections, such as that used here, following the classification of the Magnolia Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magnoliasociety.org/Classification Classification used by the Magnolia Society] accessed 8 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It does not represent the last word on the subclassification of the genus ''Magnolia'' (see above), as a clear consensus has not yet been reached. Each species entry follows this pattern: ''Botanical name'' &lt;small&gt;Naming auth.&lt;/small&gt; -  &lt;small&gt;(REGION FOUND)&lt;/small&gt;

===Etymology===
[[Charles Plumier]] (1646–1704) described a flowering tree from the island of [[Martinique]] in his ''[[Genera]]'',&lt;ref name=Plumier/&gt; giving it the name ''Magnolia'', after the French botanist [[Pierre Magnol]].

[[File:Magnolia wieseneri.jpg|thumb|[[Magnolia × wieseneri|''M.'' × ''wieseneri'']]]]

===Horticultural uses===
In general,  the genus ''Magnolia'' has attracted horticultural interest. Some, such as the shrub ''[[Magnolia stellata|M. stellata]]'' (star magnolia) and the tree [[Magnolia × soulangeana|''M.'' × ''soulangeana'']] (saucer magnolia) flower quite early in the spring, before the leaves open. Others flower in late spring or early summer, including [[Magnolia virginiana|''M. virginiana'']] (sweetbay magnolia) and [[Magnolia grandiflora|''M. grandiflora'']] (southern magnolia).

[[Hybrid (biology)|Hybridisation]] has been immensely successful in combining the best aspects of different species to give plants which flower at an earlier age than the parent species, as well as having more impressive flowers. One of the most popular garden magnolias, ''M''. × ''soulangeana'', is a hybrid of ''M. liliiflora'' and ''M. denudata''.

In the eastern United States, five native species are frequently in cultivation: ''M. acuminata'' (as a shade tree), ''M. grandiflora'', ''M. virginiana'', ''M. tripetala'', and ''M. macrophylla''. The last two species must be planted where high winds are not a frequent problem because of the size of their leaves.

===Culinary uses===
The flowers of many species are considered edible. In parts of England, the petals of M. grandiflora are pickled and used as a spicy condiment. In some Asian cuisines, the buds are pickled and used to flavor rice and scent tea. In Japan, the young leaves and flower buds of Magnolia hypoleuca are broiled and eaten as a vegetable. Older leaves are made into a powder and used as seasoning; dried, whole leaves are placed on a charcoal brazier and filled with miso, leeks, daikon, and shiitake, and broiled. There is a type of miso which is seasoned with Magnolia, hoba miso.&lt;ref&gt;Facciola, S. Cornucopia - A Source Book of Edible Plants. Kampong Publications, 1990. {{ISBN|0-9628087-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Facciola, S. Cornucopia II - A Source Book of Edible Plants. Kampong Publications,1998. {{ISBN|0-9628087-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parts of Japan, the leaves of ''M. obovata'' are used for wrapping food and as cooking dishes.

===Traditional medicine===

[[File:Magnolia Tree - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Magnolia tree in the Fall.]]
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
The bark and flower buds of ''M. officinalis'' have long been used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], where they are known as ''hou po'' (厚朴). In Japan, ''kōboku'', ''M. obovata'', has been used in a similar manner.

===Timber===
The cucumbertree, ''M. acuminata'', grows to large size and is harvested as a timber tree in northeastern US forests. Its wood is sold as "yellow poplar" along with that of the tuliptree, ''[[Liriodendron tulipifera]]''. The Fraser magnolia, ''M. fraseri'', also attains enough size sometimes to be harvested, as well.

===Other uses===

* In the 1939 song "[[Strange Fruit]]", originally written as a poem by New York schoolteacher and communist activist [[Abel Meeropol]] to condemn the practice of [[lynching]], the magnolia flower was referenced as being associated with the [[Southern United States]], where many lynchings took place: "Pastoral scene of the gallant south/The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth/''Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh'',/Then the sudden smell of burning flesh." Despite Meeropol's frequent mention of the South and magnolia trees, the image which inspired his poem, [[Lawrence Beitler]]'s 1930 photograph capturing the lynching of [[Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith]] following the robbery and murder of Claude Deteer, actually occurred in [[Marion, Indiana]], where magnolia trees are less common.
* In the 1960s, magnolias were a symbol of the South in the popular press: the ''New York Post'' noted of Lyndon Johnson that "A man who wore a ten-gallon Stetson and spoke with a magnolia accent had little hope of winning the Democratic nomination in 1960," and biographer Robert Caro picks up the symbol by saying that when Johnson became president "[t]he taint of magnolias still remained to be scrubbed off."&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Caro, ''The Passage of Power'', vol. 4 of ''The Years of Lyndon Johnson'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2012), p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''March Hare''' (called '''Haigha''' in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'') is a character most famous for appearing in the [[Tea party (social gathering)|tea party]] scene in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.

The main character, [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]], hypothesizes,

: "The March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad – at least not so mad as it was in March."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Lewis. ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Mad as a March hare]]" is a common [[British English]] phrase, both now and in Carroll's time, and appears in [[John Heywood]]'s collection of proverbs published in 1546. It is reported in ''[[The Annotated Alice]]'' by [[Martin Gardner]] that this proverb is based on popular belief about [[hare]]s' behaviour at the beginning of the long breeding season, which lasts from February to September in Britain. Early in the season, unreceptive females often use their forelegs to repel overenthusiastic males. It used to be incorrectly believed that these bouts were between males fighting for breeding supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/sharedearth.shtml |title=BBC Radio 4, Dylan Winter, Shared Earth, Feb 9th 2007 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=11 July 2008 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the character's friend, [[the Hatter]], the March Hare feels compelled to always behave as though it is tea-time because the Hatter supposedly "murdered the time" whilst singing for the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]]. [[Sir John Tenniel]]'s illustration also shows him with straw on his head, a common way to depict madness in Victorian times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unibg.it/dati/corsi/5871/35503-7.pdf |title=Alice in Wonderland (3): Overview of chapters 7–12 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alice-in-wonderland.net/alice5.html |title=Story origins – Lenny's Alice in Wonderland site |publisher=Alice-in-wonderland.net |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The March Hare later appears at the trial for the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]], and for a final time as "'''Haigha'''" (which is pronounced to rhyme with "mayor", according to Carroll), the personal messenger to the [[White King (Through the Looking Glass)|White King]] in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' (Alice either does not recognize him as the March Hare of her earlier dream, or chooses not to comment about this).

==Interpretations==

===''Alice in Verse''===
{{main|Alice in Verse: The Lost Rhymes of Wonderland}}
The major departure from Carroll's original here is that instead of appearing a jittery witness, the March Hare is cast as the Prosecutor. After the charge is read, the Hare addresses the court with an opening statement that more or less vindicates the accused, before turning his accusing eye upon the court itself for failing to serve tea with the evidence (the tarts).
{{Clear}}

=== ''Alice in the Country of Hearts'' ===
In this Japanese manga, ''[[Alice in the Country of Hearts]]'', the March Hare is Elliot March. Elliot is Blood Dupre (the Hatter)'s right-hand man. He is basically human with the exception of two brown rabbit ears. When called a rabbit, he often becomes insulted and rants about how his ears are 'just bigger than average'. He isn't specifically crazy or mad, but he is a bit violent in the beginning. He almost kills Alice with his long-barrelled gun before Blood stopped him. But, as the story progresses, it is shown that Elliot is a lovable, amusing character who is really very sweet.
{{Clear}}

===''Pandora Hearts''===
In this Japanese manga, ''[[Pandora Hearts]]'', the March Hare is a "Chain" whose "Contractor" is Reim Lunettes. It has the ability to fake death which helps Reim escape his attackers and proved to be so realistic that his comrades believed he really was dead. The March Hare was said to be a "gentle Chain" which was not suited for battle, but very useful in its own ways. In a way, it contradicts all the varieties of the March Hare, as the Hare is shown to be mad or even insane.The character Reim himself is also similar to March Hare as his friend Break has the chain Mad hatter mirrors the friendship of the Hatter and the Hare's.

==In popular culture==

* In [[SyFy]]'s TV Miniseries ''[[Alice (TV Miniseries)|Alice]]'', the March Hare is represented by the character Mad March.
* The March Hare is featured as the primary antagonist in the ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' story "Tea Party in March" in the graphic novel ''Once Upon a Time: Out of the Past''.
* In the song entitled "We Have Heaven" by the British rock group Yes, a lyric mantra is sung from beginning to end saying "Tell the Moon Dog, tell the March Hare...".

[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Disney's ''Alice in Wonderland'']], an animated film, depicted the March Hare at the tea party as being deliriously confused. He repeatedly offers Alice a cup of tea, but distractedly pulls the cup out of her reach or takes it from her hands just as she is about to drink. He was voiced by [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]], after whom his appearance and personality were modelled. He was animated by [[Ward Kimball]]. Kimball also led the [[Dixieland]] band [[Firehouse Five Plus Two]], in which he played trombone.

This version of the character was also a semi-regular on ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'' and one of the guests in ''[[House of Mouse]]'', often seen seated with the Mad Hatter. During these appearances, the March Hare was voiced by [[Jesse Corti]] and [[Maurice LaMarche]].

The March Hare also appears in the "Mad T Party" in Disney's California Adventure park. He is based on the 2010 film's Thackery Earwicket interpretation, and plays bass guitar. He is often found hopping around with Mallymkun the Dormouse on stage.

}}
The March Hare appears in the 2010 Disney film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', voiced by [[Paul Whitehouse]]. His full name is '''Thackery Earwicket'''; this, however, is not mentioned in the film. In the movie, the March Hare behaves as if constantly nerve-wracked and completely delirious. He is a cook in the film, and the way he eccentrically throws dishes and pots suggests he is an amalgam of both the March Hare and [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#The Duchess' Cook|the cook]] from Lewis Carroll's original book. The March Hare has a strong Scottish accent in this movie, while his friend the Mad Hatter (played by [[Johnny Depp]]) switches into a Scottish accent as well whenever his emotions are strained. He is first seen in the "[[Tea party (social gathering)|Tea Party]]" scene, which takes place at his "Hare House" [[windmill]]. Thackery hosts a tea party, which he shares with Tarrant Hightopp the Mad Hatter, Mallymkun the Dormouse, and Chess the [[Cheshire Cat]]. He appears a second time in the White Queen's kitchen, frantically cooking and throwing dishes. His third appearance is at the Frabjous Day scene, in which he stands with the other characters wielding a [[Ladle (spoon)|ladle]] as his weapon, nervous and somewhat ready to go to battle. Burton stated that because Whitehouse is a great comedic actor, a lot of his lines came from improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salisbury |first1=Mark |last2=Burton |first2=Tim |authorlink2=Tim Burton |title=Alice in Wonderland: A Visual Companion |publisher=Disney Editions |year=2010 |page=120 |isbn=978-1-4231-2887-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games===

* In the game ''[[American McGee's Alice]]'', the March Hare is portrayed as a victim of the Mad Hatter's insane experimentation. Both the Hare and the Dormouse have become [[clockwork]] [[cyborg]]s.
* The March Hare appears in ''[[Alice: Madness Returns]]'' (a sequel to ''American McGee's Alice'').
* In the [[Alice in Wonderland (2010 video game)|video game adaptation of Tim Burton's ''Alice in Wonderland'']], Thackery Earwicket is a playable character. His special ability is [[telekinesis]] and his main form of attack is to throw [[Dishware|dish]]es. He also uses his big ears and large feet as weapons. He uses his telekinesis to defeat the [[Bandersnatch]].

Plants with [[heterospory|heterosporous]] life cycles using microspores and megaspores arose independently in several plant groups during the [[Devonian]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bateman|first=R.M.|last2=Dimichele|first2=W.A.|year=1994|title=Heterospory - the most iterative key innovation in the evolutionary history of the plant kingdom|url=|journal=Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society|volume=69|pages=345–417|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1994.tb01276.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microspores are [[haploid]], and are produced from [[diploid]] microsporocytes by [[meiosis]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stern's Introductory Plant Biology|last=Bidlack|first=James E.|last2=Jansky|first2=Shelley H.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2011|isbn=0-07-304052-5|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morphology ==
The microspore has three different wall layers. The outer layer is called the [[wikt:perispore|perispore]], the next is the [[wikt:exospore|exospore]], and the inner layer is the [[endospore]]. The perispore is the thickest of the three layers while the exospore and endospore are relatively equal in width.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lang|first=G|year=1995|title=Quartäre Vegetationsgeschichte Europas|url=|journal=Feddes Repertorium|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seedless vascular plants==
In heterosporous seedless vascular plants, modified leaves called [[Glossary of botanical terms#microsporophyll|microsporophylls]] bear [[Glossary of botanical terms#microsporangia|microsporangia]] containing many microsporocytes that undergo [[meiosis]], each producing four microspores. Each microspore may develop into a male gametophyte consisting of a somewhat spherical [[antheridium]] within the microspore wall. Either 128 or 256 sperm cells with flagella are produced in each antheridium.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The only heterosporous [[ferns]] are aquatic or semi-aquatic, including the genera ''[[Marsilea]]'',''[[Regnellidium]]'', ''[[Pilularia]]'', ''[[Salvinia]]'', and ''[[Azolla]]''. Heterospory is also known in the [[lycopod]] genus ''[[Selaginella]]'' and in the quillwort genus ''[[Isoëtes]]''.

Types of seedless vascular plants:
* [[Fern]]s
* [[Spikemoss]]es
* [[Quillwort]]s

==Gymnosperms==
In [[seed plants]] the microspores develop into [[pollen]] grains each containing a reduced, multicellular male gametophyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gymnosperms|last=Bhatnagar|first=S.P.|publisher=New Age International|year=1996|isbn=8122407927|location=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The megaspores, in turn, develop into reduced female gametophytes that produce egg cells that, once fertilized, develop into seeds. Pollen cones or [[Glossary of botanical terms#microstrobilus|microstrobili]] usually develop toward the tips of the lower branches in clusters up to 50 or more. The microsporangia of gymnosperms develop in pairs toward the bases of the scales, which are therefore called [[Glossary of botanical terms#microsporophyll|microsporophylls]]. Each of the microsporocytes in the microsporangia undergoes meiosis, producing four haploid microspores. These develop into pollen grains, each consisting of four cells and a pair of external air sacs. The air sacs give the pollen grains added buoyancy that helps with wind dispersal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Types of Gymnosperms:
*[[Conifers]]
**[[Pine]]s
*[[Ginkgos]]
*[[Cycads]]
*[[Gnetophytes]]

==Angiosperms==
As the [[anther]] of a flowering plant develops, four patches of tissue differentiate from the main mass of cells. These patches of tissue contain many diploid microsporocyte cells, each of which undergoes meiosis producing a quartet of microspores. Four chambers (pollen sacs) lined with nutritive [[tapetal cell]]s are visible by the time the microspores are produced. 
After meiosis, the haploid microspores undergo several changes:
#The microspore divides by [[mitosis]] producing two cells. The first of the cells (the generative cell) is small and is formed inside the second larger cell (the tube cell).
#The members of each part of the microspores separate from each other.
#A double-layered wall then develops around each microspore.
These steps occur in sequence and when complete, the microspores have become pollen grains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Embryogenesis ==
Although it is not the usual route of a microspore, this process is the most effective way of yielding haploid and double haploid plants through the use of male sex hormones.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seguí-Simarro|first=José M.|last2=Nuez|first2=Fernando|date=2008-09-01|title=How microspores transform into haploid embryos: changes associated with embryogenesis induction and microspore-derived embryogenesis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01113.x/abstract|journal=Physiologia Plantarum|language=en|volume=134|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01113.x|issn=1399-3054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under certain stressors such as heat or starvation, plants select for microspore embryogenesis. It was found that over 250 different species of angiosperms responded this way.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; In the [[Stamen|anther]], after a microspore undergoes [[Pollen|microsporogenesis]], it can deviate towards embryogenesis and become star-like microspores. The microspore can then go one of four ways: Become an embryogenic microspore, undergo [[wikt:callogenesis|callogenesis]] to [[organogenesis]] (haploid/double haploid plant), become a pollen-like structure or die.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

[[File:Milgram experiment v2.svg|right|thumb|200px|The experimenter (E) orders the teacher (T), the subject of the experiment, to give what the latter believes are painful electric shocks to a learner (L), who is actually an actor and [[wikt:confederate|confederate]]. The subject is led to believe that for each wrong answer, the learner was receiving actual electric shocks, though in reality there were no such punishments. Being separated from the subject, the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electro-shock generator, which played pre-recorded sounds for each shock level.&lt;ref name="ObedStudy" /&gt;]]

The '''Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures''' was a series of [[social psychology]] [[experimental psychology|experiments]] conducted by [[Yale University]] psychologist [[Stanley Milgram]]. They measured the willingness of study participants, men from a diverse range of occupations with varying levels of education, to [[Obedience (human behavior)|obey]] an [[authority|authority figure]] who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal [[conscience]]. Participants were led to believe that they were assisting an unrelated experiment, in which they had to administer electric shocks to a "learner." These fake electric shocks gradually increased to levels that would have been fatal had they been real.&lt;ref name="blass"/&gt;

The experiment found, unexpectedly, that a very high proportion of men would fully obey the instructions, albeit reluctantly. Milgram first described his [[research]] in a 1963 article in the ''[[Journal of Abnormal Psychology|Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]]''&lt;ref name="ObedStudy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milgram |first=Stanley |year=1963 |title=Behavioral Study of Obedience |journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=371–8 |pmid=14049516 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/67/4/371 |doi=10.1037/h0040525 }} [http://library.nhsggc.org.uk/mediaAssets/Mental%20Health%20Partnership/Peper%202%2027th%20Nov%20Milgram_Study%20KT.pdf as PDF.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404094832/http://academic.evergreen.edu/curricular/social_dilemmas/fall/Readings/Week_06/milgram.pdf |date=April 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later discussed his findings in greater depth in his 1974 book, ''[[Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Milgram |first=Stanley |title=Obedience to Authority; An Experimental View |publisher=Harpercollins |year=1974 |isbn=0-06-131983-X |ref=harv |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MlpEAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiments began in July 1961, in the basement of Linsly-Chittenden Hall at Yale University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zimbardo|first1=Philip|title=When Good People Do Evil|url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2007_01/milgram.html|website=Yale Alumni Magazine|publisher=Yale Alumni Publications, Inc.|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; three months after the start of the trial of German [[Nazi]] [[war criminal]] [[Adolf Eichmann]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Milgram devised his psychological study to answer the popular contemporary question: "Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices in [[the Holocaust]] were [[Superior orders|just following orders]]?

==Procedure==
[[File:Milgram Experiment advertising.png|right|250px|thumb|Milgram Experiment advertisement]]

Three individuals took part in each session of the experiment:
*The "experimenter", who was in charge of the session.
*The "teacher", a volunteer for a single session. The "teacher" was led to believe that they were merely assisting, whereas they were actually the subject of the experiment.
*The "learner", an actor and a [[wikt:confederate|confederate]] of the experimenter, who pretended to be a volunteer.
The subject and the actor arrived at the session together. The experimenter told them that they were taking part in "a scientific study of memory and learning", to see what the effect of punishment is on a subject's ability to memorize content. Also, he always clarified that the payment for their participation in the experiment was secured regardless of its development. The subject and actor drew slips of paper to determine their roles. Unknown to the subject, both slips said "teacher". The actor would always claim to have drawn the slip that read "learner", thus guaranteeing that the subject would always be the "teacher".

Next, the teacher and learner were taken into an adjacent room where the learner was strapped into what appeared to be an electric chair. The experimenter told the participants this was to ensure that the learner would not escape.&lt;ref name="ObedStudy" /&gt; In a later variation of the experiment, the confederate was sure to mention to the participant that he had a [[Cardiovascular disease|heart condition]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} At some point prior to the actual test, the teacher was given a sample [[electric shock]] from the electroshock generator in order to experience firsthand what the shock that the learner would supposedly receive during the experiment would feel like.

The teacher and learner were then separated such that they could communicate, but not see each other. The teacher was then given a list of word pairs that he was to teach the learner. The teacher began by reading the list of word pairs to the learner. The teacher would then read the first word of each pair and read four possible answers. The learner would press a button to indicate his response. If the answer was incorrect, the teacher would administer a shock to the learner, with the voltage increasing in 15-[[volt]] increments for each wrong answer. If correct, the teacher would read the next word pair.&lt;ref name=ObedStudy/&gt;

The subjects believed that for each wrong answer, the learner was receiving actual shocks. In reality, there were no shocks. After the learner was separated from the teacher, the learner set up a tape recorder integrated with the electroshock generator, which played prerecorded sounds for each shock level. As the voltage of the fake shocks increased, the learner began making audible protests, such as banging repeatedly on the wall that separated him from the teacher. When the highest voltages were reached, the learner fell silent.&lt;ref name=ObedStudy/&gt;

If at any time the teacher indicated a desire to halt the experiment, the experimenter was instructed to give specific verbal prods. The prods were, in this order:&lt;ref name=ObedStudy/&gt;
# Please ''continue''.
# The experiment requires that you ''continue''.
# It is absolutely essential that you ''continue''.
# You have no other choice, you ''must'' go on.

If the subject still wished to stop after all four successive verbal prods, the experiment was halted. Otherwise, it was halted after the subject had given the maximum 450-volt shock three times in succession.&lt;ref name=ObedStudy/&gt;

The experimenter also had prods to use if the teacher made specific comments. If the teacher asked whether the learner might suffer permanent physical harm, the experimenter replied, "Although the shocks may be painful, there is no permanent tissue damage, so please go on." If the teacher said that the learner clearly wants to stop, the experimenter replied, "Whether the learner likes it or not, you must go on until he has learned all the word pairs correctly, so please go on."&lt;ref name="ObedStudy" /&gt;

==Results==
Before conducting the experiment, Milgram polled fourteen Yale University senior-year psychology majors to predict the behavior of 100 hypothetical teachers. All of the poll respondents believed that only a very small fraction of teachers (the range was from zero to 3 out of 100, with an average of 1.2) would be prepared to inflict the maximum voltage. Milgram also informally polled his colleagues and found that they, too, believed very few subjects would progress beyond a very strong shock.&lt;ref name="ObedStudy" /&gt; He also reached out to honorary Harvard University graduate Chaim Homnick, who noted that this experiment would not be concrete evidence of the Nazis' innocence, due to fact that "poor people are more likely to cooperate." Milgram also polled forty psychiatrists from a medical school, and they believed that by the tenth shock, when the victim demands to be free, most subjects would stop the experiment. They predicted that by the 300-volt shock, when the victim refuses to answer, only 3.73 percent of the subjects would still continue and, they believed that "only a little over one-tenth of one percent of the subjects would administer the highest shock on the board."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milgram |first=Stanley |title=Some Conditions of Obedience and Disobedience to Authority |journal=Human Relations |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=57–76 |year=1965 |doi=10.1177/001872676501800105 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Milgram's first set of experiments, 65 percent (26 of 40) of experiment participants administered the experiment's final massive 450-volt shock,&lt;ref name="ObedStudy" /&gt; and all administered shocks of at least 300 volts. Subjects were uncomfortable doing so, and displayed varying degrees of tension and stress. These signs included sweating, trembling, stuttering, biting their lips, groaning, digging their fingernails into their skin, and some were even having nervous laughing fits or seizures.&lt;ref name="ObedStudy" /&gt; Every participant paused the experiment at least once to question it. Most continued after being assured by the experimenter. Some said they would refund the money they were paid for participating.

Milgram summarized the experiment in his 1974 article, "The Perils of Obedience", writing:

{{Quote|The legal and philosophic aspects of [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] are of enormous importance, but they say very little about how most people behave in concrete situations. I set up a simple experiment at Yale University to test how much [[pain]] an ordinary citizen would inflict on another person simply because he was ordered to by an experimental scientist. Stark authority was pitted against the subjects' [participants'] strongest moral imperatives against hurting others, and, with the subjects' [participants'] ears ringing with the screams of the victims, authority won more often than not. The extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority constitutes the chief finding of the study and the fact most urgently demanding explanation.

Ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process. Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work become patently clear, and they are asked to carry out actions incompatible with fundamental standards of morality, relatively few people have the resources needed to resist authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Milgram, Stanley |title=The Perils of Obedience |journal=Harper's Magazine |year=1974 |url=http://home.swbell.net/revscat/perilsOfObedience.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216075927/http://home.swbell.net/revscat/perilsOfObedience.html |archivedate=December 16, 2010 }} Abridged and adapted from ''Obedience to Authority''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The original Simulated Shock Generator and Event Recorder, or ''shock box'', is located in the [[Archives of the History of American Psychology]].

Later, Milgram and other psychologists performed variations of the experiment throughout the world, with similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milgram|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milgram later investigated the effect of the experiment's locale on obedience levels by holding an experiment in an unregistered, backstreet office in a bustling city, as opposed to at Yale, a respectable university. The level of obedience, "although somewhat reduced, was not significantly lower." What made more of a difference was the proximity of the "learner" and the experimenter. There were also variations tested involving groups.

[[Thomas Blass]] of the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] performed a [[meta-analysis]] on the results of repeated performances of the experiment. He found that while the percentage of participants who are prepared to inflict fatal voltages ranged from 28% to 91%, there was no significant trend over time and the average percentage for US studies (61%) was close to the one for non-US studies (66%).&lt;ref name="blass"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blass |first=Thomas |title=The Milgram paradigm after 35 years: Some things we now know about obedience to authority |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=955–978 |year=1999 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1999.tb00134.x|ref=harv}} [http://neuron4.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc591Readings/Blass1999.pdf as PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331122626/http://neuron4.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc591Readings/Blass1999.pdf |date=March 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blass02"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blass, Thomas |title=The Man Who Shocked the World |journal=Psychology Today |volume=35 |issue=2 |date=Mar–Apr 2002 |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200203/the-man-who-shocked-the-world}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants who refused to administer the final shocks neither insisted that the experiment be terminated, nor left the room to check the health of the victim without requesting permission to leave, as per Milgram's notes and recollections, when fellow psychologist [[Philip Zimbardo]] asked him about that point.&lt;ref&gt;Discovering Psychology with Philip Zimbardo Ph.D. Updated Edition, "Power of the Situation," http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6059627757980071729, reference starts at 10min 59 seconds into video.&lt;/ref&gt;

Milgram created a documentary film titled ''Obedience'' showing the experiment and its results. He also produced a series of five social psychology films, some of which dealt with his experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanleymilgram.com/films.php Milgram films.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905054126/http://www.stanleymilgram.com/films.php |date=September 5, 2009 }} Accessed October 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

===Ethics===
The Milgram Shock Experiment raised questions about the [[research ethics]] of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress and [[inflicted insight]] suffered by the participants. Some critics such as Gina Perry argued that participants were not properly debriefed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Perry |first=Gina |date=2013 |title=Deception and Illusion in Milgram's Accounts of the Obedience Experiments |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gina_Perry2/publication/317914282_Deception_and_Illusion_in_Milgram%27s_accounts_of_the_Obedience_Experiments/links/5951ab510f7e9b329234d3c4/Deception-and-Illusion-in-Milgrams-accounts-of-the-Obedience-Experiments.pdf |journal=Theoretical &amp; Applied Ethics, University of Nebraska Press |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=79–92 |doi= |access-date=October 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Milgram's defense, 84 percent of former participants surveyed later said they were "glad" or "very glad" to have participated; 15 percent chose neutral responses (92% of all former participants responding).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milgram|1974|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many later wrote expressing thanks. Milgram repeatedly received offers of assistance and requests to join his staff from former participants. Six years later (at the height of the [[Vietnam War]]), one of the participants in the experiment sent correspondence to Milgram, explaining why he was glad to have participated despite the stress:

{{Quote|While I was a subject in 1964, though I believed that I was hurting someone, I was totally unaware of why I was doing so. Few people ever realize when they are acting according to their own beliefs and when they are meekly submitting to authority&amp;nbsp;... To permit myself to be [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] with the understanding that I am submitting to authority's demand to do something very wrong would make me frightened of myself&amp;nbsp;... I am fully prepared to go to jail if I am not granted [[Conscientious Objector]] status. Indeed, it is the only course I could take to be faithful to what I believe. My only hope is that members of my board act equally according to their conscience&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raiten-D'Antonio, Toni |title=Ugly as Sin: The Truth about How We Look and Finding Freedom from Self-Hatred |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j4ijAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89 |date=1 September 2010 |publisher=HCI |isbn=978-0-7573-1465-0|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milgram|1974|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his book ''[[Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View]]'', Milgram argued that the ethical criticism provoked by his experiments was because his findings were disturbing and revealed unwelcome truths about [[human nature]]. Others have argued that the ethical debate has diverted attention from more serious problems with the experiment's [[methodology]].

===Applicability to the Holocaust===
Milgram sparked direct critical response in the scientific community by claiming that "a common psychological process is centrally involved in both [his laboratory experiments and Nazi Germany] events." [[James Waller]], Chair of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Keene State College, formerly Chair of Whitworth College Psychology Department, expressed the opinion that Milgram experiments ''do not correspond well'' to the Holocaust events:&lt;ref name="Waller-111" /&gt;
# The subjects of Milgram experiments, wrote James Waller (''Becoming Evil''), were assured in advance that ''no permanent physical damage would result from their actions.'' However, the Holocaust perpetrators were fully aware of their hands-on killing and maiming of the victims.
# The laboratory subjects themselves did not know their victims and were not motivated by racism or other biases. On the other hand, the Holocaust perpetrators displayed an ''intense devaluation of the victims'' through a lifetime of personal development.
# Those serving punishment at the lab were not sadists, nor hate-mongers, and often ''exhibited great anguish and conflict'' in the experiment, unlike the designers and executioners of the Final Solution (see [[:Category:Holocaust trials|Holocaust trials]]), who had a clear "goal" on their hands, set beforehand.
# The experiment lasted for an hour, with no time for the subjects to ''contemplate the implications of their behavior''. Meanwhile, the Holocaust lasted for years with ample time for a moral assessment of all individuals and organizations involved.&lt;ref name="Waller-111"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QRHKMa_rqgC&amp;pg=PA111 | title=What Can the Milgram Studies Teach Us... | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | work=Becoming Evil: How Ordinary People Commit Genocide and Mass Killing | date=February 22, 2007 | accessdate=June 9, 2013 | author=[[James Waller]] | pages=111–113 | format=Google Book | isbn=0199774854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of Thomas Blass—who is the author of a scholarly monograph on the experiment (''The Man Who Shocked The World'') published in 2004—the historical evidence pertaining to actions of the Holocaust perpetrators speaks louder than words:

{{Quote|My own view is that Milgram's approach does not provide a fully adequate explanation of the Holocaust. While it may well account for the dutiful destructiveness of the dispassionate bureaucrat who may have shipped Jews to Auschwitz with the same degree of routinization as potatoes to Bremerhaven, it falls short when one tries to apply it to the more zealous, inventive, and hate-driven atrocities that also characterized the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="Blass"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://analyse-und-kritik.net/en/1998-1/AK_Blass_1998.pdf | title=The Roots of Stanley Milgram's Obedience Experiments and Their Relevance to the Holocaust | publisher=Analyse und Kritik.net | year=2013 | accessdate=20 July 2013 | author=Blass, Thomas | format=PDF file, direct download 733 KB | page=51 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190232/http://analyse-und-kritik.net/en/1998-1/AK_Blass_1998.pdf | archivedate=29 October 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 2004 issue of the journal ''[[Jewish Currents]]'', Joseph Dimow, a participant in the 1961 experiment at Yale University, wrote about his early withdrawal as a "teacher", suspicious "that the whole experiment was designed to see if ordinary Americans would obey immoral orders, as many Germans had done during the Nazi period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dimow |first=Joseph |url=http://www.jewishcurrents.org/2004-jan-dimow.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202065547/https://jewishcurrents.org/2004-jan-dimow.htm |archive-date=February 2, 2004|title=Resisting Authority: A Personal Account of the Milgram Obedience Experiments |journal=Jewish Currents |date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Australian psychologist Gina Perry investigated Milgram's data and writings and concluded that Milgram had manipulated the results, and that there was "troubling mismatch between (published) descriptions of the experiment and evidence of what actually transpired." She wrote that "only half of the people who undertook the experiment fully believed it was real and of those, 66% disobeyed the experimenter".&lt;ref name="perry"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gina |last=Perry |date=April 26, 2012 |title=Behind the Shock Machine: the untold story of the notorious Milgram psychology experiments |publisher=[[The New Press]] |isbn=978-1921844553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lamb120630"&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Lamb |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/the-shocking-truth-of-psychologist-stanley-milgrams-create-a-nazi-experiment/news-story/f0fa43783268a32ab95d2795c848047f |title=Review: The shocking truth of psychologist Stanley Milgram's create-a-Nazi experiment |work=[[The Australian]] |date=June 30, 2012 |accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She described her findings as "an unexpected outcome" that "leaves social psychology in a difficult situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |interviewer=[[NPR]] Staff |first=Gena |last=Perry |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/08/28/209559002/taking-a-closer-look-at-milgrams-shocking-obedience-study |title=Taking A Closer Look At Milgram's Shocking Obedience Study |publisher=[[NPR]] |work=All Things Considered |date=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
Milgram elaborated two theories:
* The first is the ''theory of conformism'', based on [[Asch conformity experiments|Solomon Asch conformity experiments]], describing the fundamental relationship between the group of reference and the individual person. A subject who has neither ability nor expertise to make decisions, especially in a crisis, will leave decision making to the group and its hierarchy. The group is the person's behavioral model.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=June 2017}}
* The second is the ''[[Agency (philosophy)|agentic]] state theory'', wherein, per Milgram, "the essence of obedience consists in the fact that a person comes to view themselves as the instrument for carrying out another person's wishes, and they therefore no longer see themselves as responsible for their actions. Once this critical shift of viewpoint has occurred in the person, all of the essential features of obedience follow".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Nissani  | first1 =Moti  | year = 1990 | title = A Cognitive Reinterpretation of Stanley Milgram's Observations on Obedience to Authority | url = http://www.is.wayne.edu/mnissani/PAGEPUB/milgram.htm | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 45 | issue =  | pages = 1384–1385 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.45.12.1384 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130205025321/http://www.is.wayne.edu/mnissani/PAGEPUB/milgram.htm | archivedate = February 5, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative interpretations===
In his book ''Irrational Exuberance'', Yale finance professor [[Robert J. Shiller]] argues that other factors might be partially able to explain the Milgram Experiments:

{{Quote|[People] have learned that when experts tell them something is all right, it probably is, even if it does not seem so.  (In fact, the experimenter was indeed correct: it ''was'' all right to continue giving the "shocks"—even though most of the subjects did not suspect the reason.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Shiller, Robert |title=Irrational Exuberance |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton NJ |year=2005 |page=158 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 2006 experiment, a computerized [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] was used in place of the learner receiving electrical shocks.  Although the participants administering the shocks were aware that the learner was unreal, the experimenters reported that participants responded to the situation physiologically "as if it were real".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Slater M, Antley A, Davison A, etal |editor1-last=Rustichini |editor1-first=Aldo |title=A virtual reprise of the Stanley Milgram obedience experiments |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=1 |issue= 1|pages=e39 |year=2006 |pmid=17183667 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000039 |pmc=1762398}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; of Milgram's results invokes [[belief perseverance]] as the underlying cause. What "people cannot be counted on is to realize that a seemingly benevolent authority is in fact malevolent, even when they are faced with overwhelming evidence which suggests that this authority is indeed malevolent. Hence, the underlying cause for the subjects' striking conduct could well be conceptual, and not the alleged 'capacity of man to abandon his humanity&amp;nbsp;... as he merges his unique personality into larger institutional structures."'

This last explanation receives some support from a 2009 episode of the [[BBC]] science documentary series ''[[Horizon (UK TV series)|Horizon]]'', which involved replication of the Milgram experiment. Of the twelve participants, only three refused to continue to the end of the experiment. Speaking during the episode, social psychologist Clifford Stott discussed the influence that the idealism of scientific inquiry had on the volunteers. He remarked: "The influence is ideological. It's about what they believe science to be, that science is a positive product, it produces beneficial findings and knowledge to society that are helpful for society. So there's that sense of science is providing some kind of system for good."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=How Violent Are You?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00kk4bz|accessdate=May 8, 2013|series=Horizon|serieslink=Horizon (BBC TV series)|credits=Presenter: [[Michael Portillo]]. Producer: Diene Petterle.|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Two]]|date=May 12, 2009|seriesno=45|number=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the importance of idealism, some recent researchers suggest the 'engaged [[followership]]' perspective. Based on an examination of Milgram's archive, in a recent study, social psychologists [[Alexander Haslam]], [[Stephen Reicher]] and Megan Birney, at the [[University of Queensland]], discovered that people are less likely to follow the prods of an experimental leader when the prod resembles an order. However, when the prod stresses the importance of the experiment for science (i.e. 'The experiment requires you to continue'), people are more likely to obey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haslam|first=S.

==Replications and variations==

===Milgram's variations===
In ''[[Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View]]'' (1974), Milgram describes nineteen variations of his experiment, some of which had not been previously reported.

Several experiments varied the distance between the participant (teacher) and the learner. Generally, when the participant was physically closer to the learner, the participant's [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] decreased. In the variation where the learner's physical immediacy was closest, where the participant had to hold the learner's arm onto a shock plate, 30 percent of participants completed the experiment. The participant's compliance also decreased if the experimenter was physically further away (Experiments 1–4). For example, in Experiment 2, where participants received telephonic instructions from the experimenter, compliance decreased to 21 percent. Some participants deceived the experimenter by ''pretending'' to continue the experiment.

In Experiment 8, an all-female contingent was used; previously, all participants had been men. Obedience did not significantly differ, though the women communicated experiencing higher levels of stress.

Experiment 10 took place in a modest office in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]], purporting to be the commercial entity "Research Associates of Bridgeport" without apparent connection to Yale University, to eliminate the university's prestige as a possible factor influencing the participants' behavior. In those conditions, obedience dropped to 47.5 percent, though the difference was not statistically significant.

Milgram also combined the effect of authority with that of [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]]. In those experiments, the participant was joined by one or two additional "teachers" (also actors, like the "learner"). The behavior of the participants' peers strongly affected the results. In Experiment 17, when two additional teachers refused to comply, only 4 of 40 participants continued in the experiment. In Experiment 18, the participant performed a subsidiary task (reading the questions via microphone or recording the learner's answers) with another "teacher" who complied fully. In that variation, 37 of 40 continued with the experiment.&lt;ref name=old&gt;[http://www.stanleymilgram.com/oldanswers.html Milgram, old answers.] Accessed October 4, 2006.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430145531/http://www.stanleymilgram.com/oldanswers.html |date=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of the release of ''Obedience to Authority'' in 1973–1974, a version of the experiment was conducted at [[La Trobe University]] in Australia. As reported by Perry in her 2012 book ''Behind the Shock Machine'', some of the participants experienced long-lasting psychological effects, possibly due to the lack of proper debriefing by the experimenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2002, the British artist [[Rod Dickinson]] created ''The Milgram Re-enactment'', an exact reconstruction of parts of the original experiment, including the uniforms, lighting, and rooms used. An audience watched the four-hour performance through one-way glass windows.&lt;ref&gt;''History Will Repeat Itself: Strategies of Re-enactment in Contemporary (Media) Art and Performance'', ed. Inke Arns, Gabriele Horn, Frankfurt: Verlag, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milgramreenactment.org|title=The Milgram Re-enactment|accessdate=June 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A video of this performance was first shown at the CCA Gallery in [[Glasgow]] in 2002.

A partial replication of the experiment was staged by British illusionist [[Derren Brown]] and broadcast on UK's [[Channel 4]] in ''[[The Heist (Derren Brown special)|The Heist]] ''(2006).&lt;ref name=DerrenBrown&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6GxIuljT3w|title=The Milgram Experiment on YouTube|accessdate=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another partial replication of the experiment was conducted by Jerry M. Burger in 2006 and broadcast on the Primetime series ''Basic Instincts''. Burger noted that "current standards for the ethical treatment of participants clearly place Milgram's studies out of bounds." In 2009, Burger was able to receive approval from the [[institutional review board]] by modifying several of the experimental protocols.&lt;ref name=BurgerWP2008&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burger|first=Jerry M.|title=Replicating Milgram: Would People Still Obey Today?|journal=[[American Psychologist]]|year=2008|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-64-1-1.pdf | doi = 10.1037/a0010932|pmid=19209958|volume=64|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burger found obedience rates virtually identical to those reported by Milgram in 1961–62, even while meeting current ethical regulations of informing participants. In addition, half the replication participants were female, and their rate of obedience was virtually identical to that of the male participants. Burger also included a condition in which participants first saw another participant refuse to continue. However, participants in this condition obeyed at the same rate as participants in the base condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[ABC News]] |date=January 3, 2007 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2765416&amp;page=1|title=The Science of Evil|accessdate=January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 French documentary ''[[Le Jeu de la Mort]]'' (''The Game of Death''), researchers recreated the Milgram experiment with an added critique of [[reality television]] by presenting the scenario as a [[game show]] pilot. Volunteers were given €40 and told they would not win any money from the game, as this was only a trial. Only 16 of 80 "contestants" (teachers) chose to end the game before delivering the highest-voltage punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124838091|title=Fake TV Game Show 'Tortures' Man, Shocks France|accessdate=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100317-disturbing-tv-docu-game-tests-limits-small-screen-power-france-game-of-death |title=Fake torture TV 'game show' reveals willingness to obey |date=March 17, 2010 |accessdate=March 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323051311/http://www.france24.com/en/20100317-disturbing-tv-docu-game-tests-limits-small-screen-power-france-game-of-death |archivedate=March 23, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiment was performed on ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' on an episode airing April 25, 2010.

The [[Discovery Channel]] aired the "How Evil are You" segment of ''[[Curiosity (TV series)|Curiosity]]'' on October 30, 2011.  The episode was hosted by [[Eli Roth]], who produced results similar to the original Milgram experiment, though the highest-voltage punishment used was 165 volts, rather than 450 volts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/curiosity/videos/how-evil-are-you.htm |title=Curiosity: How evil are you? |accessdate=April 17, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201125734/http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/curiosity/videos/how-evil-are-you.htm |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to increasingly widespread knowledge of the experiment, recent replications of the procedure have had to ensure that participants were not previously aware of it.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Other variations===
Charles Sheridan and Richard King (at the [[University of Missouri]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], respectively) hypothesized that some of Milgram's subjects may have suspected that the victim was faking, so they repeated the experiment with a real victim: a "cute, fluffy puppy" who was given real, albeit apparently harmless, electric shocks. Their findings were similar to those of Milgram: half of the male subjects and all of the females obeyed throughout. Many subjects showed high levels of distress during the experiment, and some openly wept. In addition, Sheridan and King found that the duration for which the shock button was pressed decreased as the shocks got higher, meaning that for higher shock levels, subjects were more hesitant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.holah.co.uk/files/sheridan_king_1972.pdf |title=Sheridan &amp; King (1972) – Obedience to authority with an authentic victim, Proceedings of the 80th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association 7: 165–6. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127071012/http://www.holah.co.uk/files/sheridan_king_1972.pdf |archive-date=January 27, 2018 |access-date=March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blass|1999|p=968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mobbing''', as a sociological term, means [[bullying]] of an individual by a group, in any context, such as a [[family]], [[peer group]], [[school]], [[workplace]], [[neighborhood]], [[community]], or online.

When it occurs as [[emotion]]al [[abuse]] in the workplace, such as ‘ganging up’ by co-workers, [[Hierarchy|subordinate]]s or [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]s, to force someone out of the workplace through [[rumor]], [[innuendo]], [[intimidation]], [[humiliation]], [[discrediting]], and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]], it is also referred to as malicious, nonsexual, nonracial / racial, general [[harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace'' by Noa Davenport, Ruth D. Schwartz and Gail Pursell Elliott.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of the concept ==
[[Konrad Lorenz]], in his book entitled ''[[On Aggression]]'' (1966), first described mobbing among birds and animals, attributing it to instincts rooted in the [[Darwinian]] struggle to thrive (see [[animal mobbing behavior]]). In his view, most humans are subject to similar innate impulses but capable of bringing them under rational control.&lt;ref name="Westhues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~kwesthue/mobbing.htm|title=Workplace Mobbing in Academe|website=arts.uwaterloo.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz's explanation for his choice of the English word Mobbing was omitted in the English translation by Marjorie Kerr Wilson. According to [[Kenneth Westhues]], Lorenz chose the word mobbing because he remembered in the collective attack by birds, the old German term ''hassen auf'', which means "to hate after" or "to put a hate on" was applied and this emphasised "the depth of antipathy with which the attack is made" rather than the English word mobbing which emphasised the collective aspect of the attack.&lt;ref&gt; Westhues, Kenneth.(2007) [http://www.kwesthues.com/graz0701.htm Mobbing a Natural Fact], Adapted and revised from "Mobbing am akademischen Arbeitsplatz," a lecture given in the Society for Sociology at the University of Graz, Austria, on 23 January 2007, Retrieved on 17 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s, the Swedish physician {{Interlanguage link multi|Peter-Paul Heinemann|sv|3=Peter-Paul Heinemann|vertical-align=sup}} applied Lorenz's conceptualization to the collective aggression of children against a targeted child.&lt;ref name="Westhues" /&gt;

In the 1980s, professor and practising psychologist [[Heinz Leymann]] applied the term to ganging up in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Westhues" /&gt; 

In 2011, anthropologist Janice Harper published an essay in [[The Huffington Post]] suggesting that some of the anti-bully approaches effectively constitute a form of mobbing by using the label "bully" to dehumanize, encouraging people to shun and avoid people labeled bullies, and in some cases, sabotage their work or refuse to work with them, while almost always calling for their exclusion and termination from employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/janice-harper/the-bully-label-has-to-go_b_1068456.html|title=The Bully Label Has to Go|first=Janice|last=Harper|date=1 November 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
Janice Harper followed her Huffington Post essay with a series of essays in both The Huffington Post&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janice-harper|title=Janice Harper - HuffPost|website=www.huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in her column, Beyond Bullying: Peacebuilding at Work, School and Home in Psychology Today&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beyond-bullying|title=Beyond Bullying|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; that argued that mobbing is a form of group aggression innate to primates, and that those who engage in mobbing are not necessarily "evil" or "psychopathic," but responding in a predictable and patterned manner when someone in a position of leadership or influence communicates to the group that someone must go. For that reason, she indicated that anyone can and will engage in mobbing, and that once mobbing gets underway, just as in the animal kingdom it will almost always continue and intensify as long as the target remains with the group. She subsequently published a book on the topic&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mobbed-What-When-They-Really/dp/0692693335/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=|title=Mobbed!: What to Do When They Really Are Out to Get You|first=Janice Harper|last=Ph.D|date=24 August 2013|publisher=Backdoor Press|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she explored animal behavior, organizational cultures and historical forms of group aggression, suggesting that mobbing is a form of group aggression on a continuum of structural violence with genocide as the most extreme form of mob aggression.

== In the workplace ==
{{main article|Workplace bullying}}
British anti-bullying researchers [[Andrea Adams]] and [[Tim Field]] have used the expression "workplace bullying" instead of what Leymann called "mobbing" in a workplace context. They identify mobbing as a particular type of bullying that is not as apparent as most, defining it as "an emotional assault. It begins when an individual becomes the target of disrespectful and harmful behavior. Through [[innuendo]], rumors, and public discrediting, a hostile environment is created in which one individual gathers others to willingly, or unwillingly, participate in continuous malevolent actions to force a person out of the workplace."&lt;ref name="amwork"&gt;Davenport NZ, Schwartz RD &amp; Elliott GP [http://www.mobbing-usa.com Mobbing, Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace], 3rd Edition 2005, Civil Society Publishing. Ames, IA,&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams and Field believe that mobbing is typically found in work environments that have poorly organised production or working methods and incapable or inattentive management and that mobbing victims are usually "exceptional individuals who demonstrated intelligence, competence, creativity, integrity, accomplishment and dedication".&lt;ref name="amwork" /&gt;

In contrast, Janice Harper&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt; suggests that workplace mobbing is typically found in organizations where there is limited opportunity for employees to exit, whether through tenure systems or contracts that make it difficult to terminate an employee (such as universities or unionized organizations), and/or where finding comparable work in the same community makes it difficult for the employee to voluntarily leave (such as academic positions, religious institutions, or military). In these employments, efforts to eliminate the worker will intensify to push the worker out against his or her will through shunning, sabotage, false accusations and a series of investigations and poor reviews. Another form of employment where workers are mobbed are those that require the use of uniforms or other markers of group inclusion (law enforcement, fire fighting, military), organizations where a single gender has predominated, but the other gender is beginning to enter (STEM fields, fire fighting, military, nursing, teaching, and construction). Finally, she suggests that organizations where there are limited opportunities for advancement can be prone to mobbing because those who do advance are more likely to view challenges to their leadership as threats to their precarious positions. Harper further challenges the idea that workers are targeted for their exceptional competence. In some cases, she suggests, exceptional workers are mobbed because they are viewed as threatening to someone, but some workers who are mobbed are not necessarily good workers. Rather, Harper contends, some mobbing targets are outcasts or unproductive workers who cannot easily be terminated, and are thus treated inhumanely to push them out. While Harper emphasizes the cruelty and damaging consequences of mobbing, her organizational analysis focuses on the structural, rather than moral, nature of the organization. Moreover, she views the behavior itself, which she terms workplace aggression, as grounded in group psychology, rather than individual psychosis—even when the mobbing is initiated due to a leader's personal psychosis, the dynamics of group aggression will transform the leader's bullying into group mobbing—two vastly distinct psychological and social phenomena.

Shallcross, Ramsay and Barker consider workplace "mobbing" to be a generally unfamiliar term in some English speaking countries. Some researchers claim that mobbing is simply another name for bullying. Workplace mobbing can be considered as a "virus" or a "cancer" that spreads throughout the workplace via [[gossip]], [[rumour]] and [[unfounded accusations]]. It is a deliberate attempt to force a person out of their workplace by [[humiliation]], general [[harassment]], [[emotional abuse]] and/or [[terrorism|terror]]. Mobbing can be described as being "ganged up on." Mobbing is executed by a leader (who can be a manager, a co-worker, or a subordinate). The leader then rallies others into a systematic and frequent "mob-like" behaviour toward the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Shallcross, L, Ramsay, S, &amp; Barker M, (2008) [http://www.lindas.internetbasedfamily.com/f/SHALLCROSS_LINDA1.pdf Workplace Mobbing: Expulsion, Exclusion, and Transformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713045605/http://www.lindas.internetbasedfamily.com/f/SHALLCROSS_LINDA1.pdf |date=13 July 2011 }}, retrieved 17 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobbing as "downward bullying" by superiors is also known as "bossing", and "upward bullying" by colleagues as "staffing", in some European countries, for instance, in German-speaking regions.&lt;ref&gt;Oberhofer, P [http://www.business-wissen.de/artikel/bossing-und-staffing-mobbing-zwischen-chef-und-mitarbeitern/ Bossing und Staffing], retrieved 25 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological and health effects ===
Victims of workplace mobbing frequently suffer from: [[adjustment disorders]], somatic symptoms, [[psychological trauma]] (e.g., trauma [[tremor]]s or sudden onset [[selective mutism]]), [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), and [[major depression]].&lt;ref name="CPV"&gt;Hillard JR [http://www.innovations-training.com/0804CP_Article4.pdf Workplace mobbing: Are they really out to get your patient?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509035009/http://www.innovations-training.com/0804CP_Article4.pdf |date=9 May 2010 }} Current Psychiatry Volume 8 Number 4 April 2009 Pages 45–51&lt;/ref&gt;

In mobbing targets with PTSD, Leymann notes that the "mental effects were fully comparable with PTSD from war or prison camp experiences." Some patients may develop alcoholism or other substance abuse disorders. Family relationships routinely suffer. Workplace targets and witnesses may even develop brief psychotic episodes [[occupational psychosis]] generally with paranoid symptoms. Leymann estimated that 15% of suicides in Sweden could be directly attributed to workplace mobbing.&lt;ref name="CPV" /&gt;

== At school ==
{{See also|School bullying}}
Following on from the work of Heinemann, Elliot identifies mobbing as a common phenomenon in the form of group bullying at school. It involves 'ganging up' on someone using tactics of [[rumor]], [[innuendo]], [[discrediting]], [[Social rejection|isolating]], [[intimidating]], and above all, making it look as if the targeted person is responsible ([[victim blaming]]).&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott GP [https://books.google.com/books?id=QHm5dqvPLSwC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PR8&amp;dq=mobbing+bully+checklist ''School Mobbing and Emotional Abuse: See it – Stop it – Prevent it with Dignity and Respect'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== In academia ==
{{See also|Bullying in academia}}
[[Kenneth Westhues]]' study of mobbing in [[academia]] found that [[vulnerability]] was increased by personal differences such as being a foreigner or of a different sex; by working in fields such as music or literature which have recently come under the sway of less objective and more [[post-modern]] scholarship; financial pressure; or having an aggressive superior.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; Other factors included [[envy]], [[heresy]] and [[campus politics]].&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{citation |url=http://uv-net.uio.no/wpmu/hedda/2007/05/13/workplace-bullying-in-the-academic-world/ |title=Workplace Bullying in the Academic World? |date=13 May 2007 |publisher=Higher Education Development Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724185410/http://uv-net.uio.no/wpmu/hedda/2007/05/13/workplace-bullying-in-the-academic-world/ |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Checklists ==
Sociologists and authors have created checklists and other tools to identify mobbing behaviour.&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Westhues2"&gt;Westhues K. [http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~kwesthue/checklist.htm Checklist of Mobbing Indicators] 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohut MR [https://books.google.com/books?id=aSREF06T2ZQC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA169 ''The Complete Guide to Understanding, Controlling, and Stopping Bullies &amp; Bullying at Work: A Complete Guide for Managers, Supervisors, and Co-Workers'']&lt;/ref&gt; Common approaches to assessing mobbing behavior is through quantifying frequency of mobbing behavior based off a given definition of the behavior or through quantifying what respondents believe encompasses mobbing behavior. These are referred to as "self-labeling" and "behavior experience" methods respectively.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steffgen|first1=Georges|last2=Sischka|first2=Philipp|last3=Schmidt|first3=Alexander|last4=Kohl|first4=Diane|last5=Happ|first5=Christian|title=The Luxembourg Workplace Mobbing Scale|journal=European Journal of Psychological Assessment|date=2016|doi=10.1027/1015-5759/a000381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limitations of some mobbing examination tools are:
* Participant exhaustion due to examination length
* Limited sample exposure resulting in limited result generalizability
* Confounding with constructs that result in the same affect as mobbing but are not purposely harmful 

Common Tools used to measure mobbing behavior are:
* Leyman Inventory of Psychological Terror&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leymann|first1=Heinz|title=Leymann Inventory of Psychological Terror|journal=Tübingen: Deutsche Gellschaft für Verhaltenstherapie Verlag.|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; (LIPT)
* Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einarsen|first1=Staale|last2=Hoel|first2=Helge|last3=Notelaers|first3=Guy|title=Measuring exposure to bullying and harassment at work: Validity, factor structure and psychometric properties of the Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised|journal=Work &amp; Stress|date=2009|volume=23|pages=24-44|doi=10.1080/02678370902815673}}&lt;/ref&gt; (NAQ-R)
* Luxembourg Workplace Mobbing Scale&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; (LWMS)

The [http://www.kwesthues.com/wami.pdf Waterloo Anti-Mobbing  Instruments (WAMI)] created by [[Kenneth Westhues]] contains a 16 item checklist to identify the signs of mobbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwesthues.com/wami.pdf |title=Conference Summary |format=PDF |date=2004 |accessdate=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Counteracting Mobbing ==
From an organizational perspective, it has been suggested that mobbing behavior can be curtailed by acknowledging behaviors as mobbing behaviors and that such behaviors result in harm and/or negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sperry|first1=Len|title=Workplace mobbing and bullying: a consulting psychology perspective and overview|journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|date=2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=165-168|doi=10.1037/a0016936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precise definitions of such traits are critical due to ambiguity of unacceptable and acceptable behaviors potentially leading to unintentional mobbing behavior. Attenuation of mobbing behavior can further be enhanced by developing policies that explicitly address specific behaviors that are culturally accepted to result in harm or negative affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duffy|first1=Maureen|title=Preventing workplace mobbing and bullying with effective organizational consultation, policies, and legislation|journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|date=2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=242-262|doi=10.1037/a0016783}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This provides a framework from which mobbing victims can respond to mobbing. Lack of such a framework may result in a situation where each instance of mobbing is treated on an individual basis with no recourse of prevention. It may also indicate that such behaviors are warranted and within the realm of acceptable behavior within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferris|first1=Patricia|title=The role of the consulting psychologist in the prevention, detection, and correction of bullying and mobbing in the workplace|journal=Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|date=2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=169-189|doi=10.1037/a0016783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct responses to grievances related to mobbing that are handled outside of a courtroom and training programs outlining antibully-countermeasures also demonstrate a reduction in mobbing behavior.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

{{About|moral absolutism as a theory of [[normative ethics]]|moral absolutism as a theory of [[meta-ethics]]|Moral universalism}}

'''Moral absolutism''' is an [[Ethics|ethical]] view that all [[action (philosophy)|actions]] are intrinsically right or wrong. Stealing, for instance, might be considered to be always [[Immorality|immoral]], even if done for the well-being of others (e.g., stealing food to feed a starving family), and even if it does in the end promote such a good. Moral absolutism stands in contrast to other categories of [[normative ethics|normative ethical theories]] such as [[consequentialism]], which holds that the [[morality]] (in the wide sense) of an act depends on the consequences or the context of the act.

Moral absolutism is not the same as [[moral universalism]]. Universalism holds merely that what is right or wrong is independent of custom or opinion (as opposed to [[moral relativism]]), but not necessarily that what is right or wrong is independent of context or consequences (as in absolutism). Moral universalism is compatible with moral absolutism, but also positions such as consequentialism. [[Louis Pojman]] gives the following definitions to distinguish the two positions of moral absolutism and universalism:&lt;ref name="PojmanDefense"&gt;Pojman, L. P. ''A Defense of Ethical Objectivism'' (p. 50).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Moral absolutism: There is at least one principle that ought never to be violated.
* Moral objectivism: There is a fact of the matter as to whether any given action is morally permissible or impermissible: a fact of the matter that does not depend solely on social custom or individual acceptance.

Ethical theories which place strong emphasis on [[rights]] and [[duty]], such as the [[deontological ethics]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], are often forms of moral absolutism, as are many [[religion|religious]] moral codes.

==Religion==
Moral absolutism may be understood in a strictly secular context, as in many forms of deontological [[moral rationalism]]. However, many religions have morally absolutist positions as well, regarding their system of morality as [[divine command theory|deriving from divine commands]]. Therefore, they regard such a moral system as absolute, (usually) perfect, and unchangeable. Many secular philosophies also take a morally absolutist stance, arguing that absolute laws of morality are inherent in the nature of human beings, the nature of life in general, or the universe itself. For example, someone who believes absolutely in [[nonviolence]] considers it wrong to use violence even in self-defense.

[[Catholic philosopher]] [[Thomas Aquinas]] never explicitly addresses the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], but draws a distinction between what is good or evil in itself and what is good or evil because of God's commands,{{sfn|Aquinas|c. 1265–1274|loc=2a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3057.htm#article2 57.2]}} with unchangeable moral standards forming the bulk of [[natural law]].{{sfn|Aquinas|c. 1265–1274|loc=2a1ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2094.htm#article5 94.5]}} Thus he contends that not even God can change the [[Ten Commandments]], adding, however, that God ''can'' change what individuals deserve in particular cases, in what might look like special dispensations to murder or steal.{{sfn|Aquinas|c. 1265–1274|loc=1a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2100.htm#article8 100.8]}}

'''Morris Michael Edelstein''' (February 5, 1888 – June 4, 1941) was a [[Poland|Polish]]-born [[U.S. Congress|Congressional]] [[U.S. House of Representatives|Representative]] from the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Edelstein was born in [[Międzyrzec Podlaski|Meseritz (Międzyrzec Podlaski)]], [[Poland]], and at three years of age immigrated to the [[United States]] with his parents, who settled in [[New York, New York|New York City]]. He attended public schools and [[Cooper Union|Cooper Union College]] in New York. He graduated from the [[Brooklyn Law School]] of [[St. Lawrence University]], in 1909, and was admitted to the bar in 1910 and practiced law in New York. Edelstein was elected as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] to the [[Seventy-sixth United States Congress|Seventy-sixth Congress]] to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[William I. Sirovich]]. He was reelected to the [[Seventy-seventh United States Congress|Seventy-seventh Congress]] and served from February 6, 1940, until his death on June 4, 1941, in the cloakroom of the House of Representatives, [[Washington, DC]], after completing the delivery of a speech on the floor of the House.

==June 4, 1941==
Edelstein's last speech was a response to [[Mississippi]] Representative [[John Elliott Rankin]], widely described as an [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semite]] who advocated peace with [[Nazi Germany]]. Rankin had just delivered a House floor speech accusing "international Jewish brethren" of trying to drag America into [[World War II]].

In response, Edelstein, who was Jewish said: "[[Hitler]] started out by speaking about 'Jewish brethren.' It is becoming the play and the work of those people who want to demagogue to speak about their 'Jewish brethren' and 'international bankers.' ... I deplore the idea that ... men in this House ... attempt to use the Jews as their scapegoat. I say it is unfair and I say it is un-American. ... All men are created equal, regardless of race, creed or color, and whether a man be Jew or [[Gentile]], he may think what he deems fit." Edelstein then walked out of the House. He collapsed and died shortly afterwards in the House cloakroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Edelstein Dies After Clash with Rankin in House over Anti-jewish Speech |first= |last= |url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1941/06/05/2854463/edelstein-dies-after-clash-with-rankin-in-house-over-antijewish-speech |newspaper=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |date=5 June 1941 |accessdate=4 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606011837/http://archive.jta.org/article/1941/06/05/2854463/edelstein-dies-after-clash-with-rankin-in-house-over-antijewish-speech |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Edelstein Dies After House Talk — New Yorker Makes a Reply to Rankin's Charges on Jews and Collapses in Lobby — Heart Attack Is Cause — He Is Praised by Colleagues — Lived All But First Three Years in Own District|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1941/06/05/87618362.html?pageNumber=24|accessdate=23 April 2017|work=New York Times|date=June 5, 1941|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morton Shulman''', [[Order of Canada|OC]] (25 April 1925 – 18 August 2000) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician, businessman, broadcaster, columnist, coroner, and physician. He was born in [[Old Toronto|Toronto]], [[Ontario]] in 1925 to a [[Judaism|Jewish]] family.  He first came to fame as Ontario's Chief [[Coroner]] in the early 1960s. During this period, he also became a very successful stock-market player, and authored a bestselling book about how to make money in the stock market. In the mid-1960s he embarrassed the provincial government when he found them to be disobeying provincial health and safety laws. He was fired and then ran for elected office in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]], avenging himself by beating a government [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|Member  of Provincial Parliament]] (MPP). He completed two terms as the [[High Park (provincial electoral district)|High Park]] electoral district's MPP, and did not run in the [[Ontario general election, 1975|1975 Ontario general election]]. His fame grew in the late 1970s and 1980s when he hosted a nationally distributed television talk show called ''The Shulman File''. He was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] in the early 1980s and became a pharmaceutical entrepreneur specializing in treatments for that disease. Near the end of his life, he received recognition for his lifetime's work, when he was appointed to the [[Order of Canada]], the country's highest civilian award. He died in Toronto in the year 2000.

==Biography==
Born in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Shulman received his M.D. from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1948. Shulman practised throughout his professional life with a general practice on [[Roncesvalles Avenue]] in Toronto.&lt;ref name="star obit"&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coroner===
In exchange for his involvement in the [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party]], he was appointed Ontario's chief [[coroner]] in 1961.&lt;ref name ="star obit"/&gt; In 1963, he was named Chief Coroner of the Municipality of [[Metropolitan Toronto]].&lt;ref name="Archives Bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shulman, Morton, 1925-2000: Biographical Sketch|url=http://ao.minisisinc.com/scripts/mwimain.dll/4185/REFD/F~204394?KEYSEARCH|work=Archives of Ontario|publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario|accessdate=2012-04-07|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69NgYCBZ7?url=http://ao.minisisinc.com/scripts/mwimain.dll/4185/REFD/F~204394?KEYSEARCH|archivedate=2012-07-23|location=Toronto|year=2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shulman was outspoken and used his position as coroner to crusade on a number of issues such as enacting tougher regulations on [http://torontoist.com/2012/07/historicist-introducing-dr-morton-shulman/ lifejackets for small boats], having government regulate car safety, the introduction of [[breathalyser]]s into Ontario, and against then-restrictive [[abortion]] laws after he investigated the deaths of women who had died while trying to terminate their pregnancies.&lt;ref name ="star obit"/&gt; In other crusades, he helped to force surgeons to count instruments before and after surgery, and construction companies to provide better bracing in trenches.&lt;ref name ="star obit"/&gt; His years as a coroner became the inspiration for the Canadian television drama ''[[Wojeck]]''.&lt;ref name="Archives Bio"/&gt;

===Political career===
After embarrassing the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] (Tory) provincial government, by revealing its inaction in enforcing the fire code in a recently built hospital, he was fired, in 1967, as Metropolitan Toronto's Chief Coroner.&lt;ref name="ToStar 19670913"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to avenge himself by running for a seat in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]].&lt;ref name="ToStar 19670913"/&gt; Despite ideological differences, he ran for the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] (NDP) in the [[High Park (provincial electoral district)|High Park]] [[electoral district]], where his medical clinic was located.&lt;ref name="ToStar 19670913"/&gt; Despite his strong [[capitalism|capitalist]] beliefs, he decided to run for the [[democratic socialist]] party because they gave him a free hand in choosing where to run, and because their views in support of public safety were compatible with his.&lt;ref name="Shulman joins NDP"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected as a [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|Member of Provincial Parliament]] (MPP) in the [[Ontario general election, 1967|1967 provincial election]], by defeating High Park's incumbent MPP, Progressive Conservative [[Alfred Cowling|Alfred Hozack Cowling]] by over 6200 votes.&lt;ref name="ToStar 19671018"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

He used his position in the legislature to become a thorn in the side of the Tory governments led by [[John Robarts]] and [[Bill Davis]]. He asked provocative questions in the legislature and was known for stunts, such as selling the book ''[[The Happy Hooker]]'' out of his office after it had been banned by the Toronto Police morality squad — he offered MPPs a 10 percent discount. Once, to make a point about lax security, he carried a pellet gun — dressed up to look like a submachine gun — in a bag through an Ontario nuclear plant, and then pulled it out on the floor of the Legislature. He waved it around happily while [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] ministers sitting across from him hid under their desks. He wrote the book "MPP" to describe his experiences, one of at least three autobiographies that he wrote.
Shulman demanded that he be appointed [[Attorney General]] if the NDP ever won government. NDP leader [[Stephen Lewis]] refused to commit to making such a promise.&lt;ref name="Globe Obit" /&gt; After clashing with his colleagues in the NDP — particularly Lewis — Shulman decided to leave the legislature and did not run in the [[Ontario general election, 1975|1975 election]].&lt;ref name="Globe Obit" /&gt;

===''The Shulman File''===
After leaving politics, he started a broadcasting career, most notably from 1977 until 1983, he hosted a hard-hitting television talk show on [[CITY-TV]] called ''The Shulman File'' which featured confrontational interviews, sensationalist and risqué topics and outrageous opinions.&lt;ref name="Globe Obit" /&gt; The show was spoofed by ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' as ''Murray's File''. At the same time, he began writing a regular column in the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' which continued into the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Archives Bio" /&gt;  During this period, he became more involved in the financial community, heading up a [[mutual fund]] and pursuing various business interests.&lt;ref name="Globe Obit" /&gt;

===Deprenyl===
Shulman was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1983, and formed a company, Deprenyl Research Ltd. (which became Draxis Health Inc.),&lt;ref name=Draxis&gt;{{cite web|title=Draxis Health Inc.|url=http://canadiancompanies.landoffree.com/company/Draxis_Health_Inc.|work=Canadian Companies|publisher=LandOfFree.com|accessdate=2012-04-07|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66knL8gLk?url=http://canadiancompanies.landoffree.com/company/Draxis_Health_Inc.|archivedate=2012-04-07|year=2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to acquire Canadian rights to the anti-Parkinson's drug [[Deprenyl]].&lt;ref name="Globe Obit" /&gt; His company engaged in a long fight with the federal government for approval of the drug for sale in Canada. He also started a second pharmaceutical company, called DUSA, now run by his son.

===Honours and death===
In 1993, Shulman was awarded the [[Order of Canada]], and was invested as an Officer of the Order on 6 January 1994.&lt;ref name="Order of Canada"&gt;{{cite web

'''Sheree Joy Beasley''' (25 February 1985 &amp;ndash; 29 June 1991) was an [[Australian]] schoolgirl from [[Rosebud, Victoria|Rosebud]], an outer suburb of [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

Six year-old Sheree was kidnapped, raped, and murdered by '''Robert Arthur Selby Lowe''' in June 1991.&lt;ref name=reader&gt;

One of the leading items that led to Lowe's incarceration was based on patient care sessions that were recorded by police investigators and later by his psychotherapist.

On the 24th anniversary of her murder, a memorial service was held at her grave, which many members of the community attended.&lt;ref name="peninsula" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mornington"&gt;{{cite news

==Murder==
Sheree rode her bicycle to a nearby [[milk bar]], where she was abducted by Robert Lowe, a Sunday school teacher, church elder and travelling salesman.&lt;ref name=quist/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Age"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silvester|first1=John|title=The daily grind of a rotting soul|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/the-daily-grind-of-a-rotting-soul-20140307-34cni.html|accessdate=20 March 2017|work=The Age|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=8 March 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowe had apparently targeted Sheree because he had seen her alone on several previous occasions. A possible explanation for the lack of supervision was that Sheree had been transferred several times between the custody of her mother and the custody of her maternal and paternal grandparents.&lt;ref name=reader/&gt;

After the abduction, several witnesses said that they had seen a middle-aged man driving a car containing a "distressed child".&lt;ref name=psych/&gt;&lt;ref name=peninsula/&gt;

Lowe had a history of crimes involving children. Before Sheree's murder, he had had multiple offences for [[indecent exposure]], which had been aimed at young girls.&lt;ref name=psych/&gt;

Months after the murder, he was seeing a [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] because he was having marital problems. His therapist, Margaret Hobbs, eventually began to suspect that he was involved in the murder of Sheree. Lowe had given suspicious statements, saying that he did not remember where he was on the day Sheree died and that he felt police were closing in on him.

The police had interviewed Lowe after the abduction, and they later [[Tape recorder|tape-recorded]] some of his sessions with Hobbs (initially without her knowledge). After being informed of the recording, Hobbs gave her permission for more taping, as she was disturbed by Lowe's statements.&lt;ref name=psych/&gt;

==Trial and conviction==

Those representing Lowe during his trial objected to the manner in which recorded evidence was obtained from his therapy sessions with Hobbs. They asserted that the recordings were a violation of a confidentiality policy. The court dismissed this and came to the consensus that the evidence was appropriate for the protection of the public.&lt;ref name=psych/&gt;

Hobbs stated that Lowe had discussed several suspicious details related to Sheree's murder. Such statements were concerned with a desire to "build an [[alibi]]" and with the consequences of pleading guilty to [[manslaughter]]. Lowe eventually stated in April 1992 that he had given Sheree a ride in his car and had manually strangled her.&lt;ref name=psych/&gt; During his trial, he admitted his guilt. He said that he had [[Strangling|"choked the girl"]].&lt;ref name=quist/&gt; Lowe was subsequently convicted of kidnapping and murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment plus 15 years without parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Paul|title=Sheree Beasley murder: Why paedophile Robert Arthur Selby Lowe and ‘Mr Cruel’ changed suburban life|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/true-crime-scene/sheree-beasley-murder-why-paedophile-robert-arthur-selby-lowe-and-mr-cruel-changed-suburban-life/news-story/7b1552fbba87433966d3bd072da12c43?nk=2868e76a75ac4c8ce3fcfcc1ec49c37c-1490049343|accessdate=20 March 2017|work=Herald Sun|date=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mako File"&gt;{{cite web|title=MAKO/Files Online {{!}} # Robert Arthur Selby Lowe|url=http://www.mako.org.au/temprobertlowe.html|website=MAKO/Files online|accessdate=20 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321035455/http://www.mako.org.au/temprobertlowe.html|archivedate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After Lowe was sent to prison for murdering Sheree, he stated that he was innocent. In August 2014, he wrote that he believed law enforcement was using him as a [[scapegoat]] because of their failure to find those who were responsible for the crime. The police and the family of the victim did not believe this, and said they were "sickened" by his assertions.&lt;ref name=quist&gt;{{cite news|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/vic/a/24647200/child-killer-robert-arthur-selby-lowe-pleads-innocence-from-behind-bars/|title=Child killer Robert Arthur Selby Lowe pleads innocence from behind bars|publisher=Yahoo 7 News|author=Jackie Quist|date=2014-08-06|accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="7News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Brendan|title=Sheree Beasley's mother disgusted by killer's claims of innocence|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/vic/a/24656527/sheree-beasleys-mother-disgusted-by-killers-claims-of-innocence/#page1|accessdate=20 March 2017|work=7News Melbourne|publisher=publisher yahoo7|date=7 August 2014|ref=7News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lowe's conviction, his psychotherapist Margaret Hobbs began writing a book based on her experience. She died in a vehicle accident in 1996; her book was later completed and published by [[Andrew Rule]].&lt;ref name=reader/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Evil"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobbs|first1=Margaret|last2=Rule|first2=Andrew|title=The Evil: Inside the Mind of a Child Killer|date=1997|publisher=Mandarin|location=Kew, Vic.|isbn=1863305513|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/658049.The_Evil|accessdate=21 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowe is believed to have been involved with a large amount of [[child pornography]] that had been smuggled into the prison in which he was incarcerated. It is believed that persons who were visiting inmates were the source of this material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/evil-killer-robert-arthur-selby-lower-running-jail-sex-ring/story-fni0ffnk-1225966143895|title=Evil killer Robert Arthur Selby Lowe running jail sex ring|publisher=Herald Sun|author=Wayne Flower|date=2010-12-06|accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], an '''ooze''' is a type of creature. This category includes such [[monster]]s as [[slime (biology)|slimes]] (such as [[Green slime (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|green slime]] within the world of the game), jellies, deadly puddings, and similar mindless, amorphous blobs. They can be used by [[Dungeon Master]]s as enemies of the player characters.

Many oozes dwell underground, and most secrete an acid from their skin that dissolves flesh and other materials rapidly.

Oozes are essentially blind, but more than make up for that with an ability called "blindsight", which allows them to discern nearby objects and creatures without needing to see them visually.

All of these creatures were reprinted in the ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' (1993) under the "ooze/slime/jelly" heading, except for the deadly puddings which appeared under their own heading.&lt;ref&gt;[[Doug Stewart (game designer)|Stewart, Doug]], ed. ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 3rd edition (2000–2007)===

==Descriptions==
* '''Aballin:''' The [[B:Dungeons &amp; Dragons/Monsters/Aballin|aballin]] was introduced in the ''[[Fiend Folio]]'' Monstrous Compendium supplement book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Skip Williams|Williams, Skip]], et al. ''[[Monstrous Compendium]] Fiend Folio Appendix'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; In the game, they resemble large puddles of stagnant, jelly-like water. (They are actually oozes though, not elemental creatures of water, because their substance, though it resembles water, is actually an acid.) They were supposedly created in ancient times when a druid fell victim to an archwizard's curse and turned into the first aballin. All other aballins are thought to be descended from her. Like most oozes, aballins live underground. Unlike some oozes, however, most of which merely drag themselves around and engulf whatever they find, aballins have a more sophisticated way of feeding. They lie dormant until prey comes along, and the said prey notices coins and other treasures, the remnants of the aballin's previous victims, floating at the bottom of the creature. Thinking it to be merely water, they reach in to retrieve the treasures, and then the aballin lashes out with liquid [[pseudopod]]s, grapples with the victim, and pulls them in and drowns them. Aballins cannot speak, and they are regarded as [[alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Neutral]] in alignment.

==Other publishers==
The [[Necromancer Games]] supplement, ''The Tome of Horrors'' (2002), contains the crystal ooze, diger, mercury ooze, mustard jelly, slithering tracker, and stunjelly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1885">A '''patient diary''' is a tool used during a clinical trial or a disease treatment to assess the patient's condition (e.g. symptom severity, quality of life) or to measure treatment compliance. An '''electronic patient diary''' registers the data in a storage device and allows for automatically monitoring the time the entry was made.

Frequent recording of symptoms using a diary helps to reduce recall bias. Electronic diaries ensure entries are made as scheduled, and not, for example, in a batch immediately before the clinic visit. 

Patient diaries are also way to find out if a patient takes the medication according to the treatment schedule, which is an important problem during clinical trials and the treatment of degenerative diseases with relatively few symptoms.

Some time in the spring of 1858, Teresa Sickles began an affair with Key.&lt;ref name="Gallagher" /&gt; Dan Sickles, though a serial adulterer himself, had accused his much-younger wife of adultery several times during their five-year marriage, but she had repeatedly denied it to his satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt; But then Sickles received a [[poison pen letter]]&lt;ref&gt;from [http://www.assumption.edu/dept/history/Hi113net/sickles/default1.html assumption.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914160639/http://www.assumption.edu/dept/history/Hi113net/sickles/default1.html |date=2006-09-14 }} "The stories told how Sickles had received an anonymous letter on Thursday, February 24th, informing him of his wife's relationship with Key."&lt;/ref&gt; informing him of his wife's affair with Key.&lt;ref&gt;The anonymous letter was reproduced in Harper's: [http://www.assumption.edu/acad/ii/Academic/history/Hi113net/sickles/anonletter.html Letter image]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallagher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt; He confronted his wife, who confessed to the affair.&lt;ref name="Gallagher" /&gt; Sickles then made his wife write out her confession on paper.&lt;ref name="Hartog"&gt;Hartog, Hendrik.

[[File:Sickles homicide.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' engraving of [[Daniel Sickles]] shooting Key]]
Sickles saw Key sitting on a bench outside the Sickles home on February 27, 1859, signalling to Teresa, and confronted him.&lt;ref&gt;Tagg, Larry. ''The Generals of Gettysburg.'' Campbell, Calif.: Savas Publishing, 1998. {{ISBN|1-882810-30-9}}. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallagher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartog" /&gt; Sickles rushed outside into [[President's Park|Lafayette Square]], cried "Key, you scoundrel, you have dishonored my home; you must die",&lt;ref&gt;Flower, ''Edwin McMasters Stanton: The Autocrat of Rebellion, Emancipation, and Reconstruction,'' 1905, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; and with a pistol repeatedly shot the unarmed Key.&lt;ref name="Gallagher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walther" /&gt;

Key was taken into the nearby [[Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House]], where he died some time later.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, Hal H. "Historic Washington Homes.'' ''Records of the Columbia Historical Society, Washington.'' 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Pontianak (disambiguation)}}

The '''pontianak''' (Dutch-Indonesian spelling: ''boentianak'', [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: ڤونتيانق) is a female vampiric ghost in [[Malay folklore|Malay mythology]]. It is also known as a '''matianak''' or '''kuntilanak''', sometimes shortened to '''kunti'''. Pontianak is called '''[[Churel]]''', or '''Churayl''', in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. The pontianak are said to be the spirits of women who died while pregnant. This is despite the fact that the earliest recordings of pontianaks in Malay lore describe the ghost as originating from a [[stillborn]] child.&lt;ref name="magic"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/gutenberg.org/4/7/8/7/47873/47873-h/47873-h.htm|title=Malay Magic|last=Skeat|first=William Walter|publisher=MacMillan and Co|year=1900|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pagan"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUATAAAAYAAJ|title=Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula|last=Skeat|first=Walter William|last2=Blagden|first2=Charles Otto|date=1906-01-01|publisher=Macmillan and Company, limited|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yhZzAAAAMAAJ|title=Woman's Mysteries of a Primitive People: The Ibibios of Southern Nigeria|last=Talbot|first=D. Amaury|date=1915-01-01|publisher=Cassell and Company|pages=216–217|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often confused with a related creature, the [[lang suir]], which is the ghost of a woman who died while giving birth. 

==Etymology==
The word ''pontianak'' is reportedly a corruption of the [[Malay language|Malay]] ''perempuan mati beranak'', or “[[Maternal death|woman who died in childbirth]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Lee R. ''The Almost Complete Collection of True Singapore Ghost Stories.'' 2nd ed. Singapore: Flame of the Forest, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that the word is a combination of ''puan'' (woman) + ''mati'' (die) + ''anak'' (child). The term ''matianak'' means "death of a child". The city of [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]] in Indonesia is named after this wicked creature, which was a ghosts' nest until Syarif Abdurrahman Alkadrie and his Army fought and extruded ghosts who attacked his group by shooting cannon balls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/bm/newsfeatures.php?id=361412 Amrizan Madian; ''Matahari Tegak Dua Kali Setahun di Kota Khatulistiwa''; Situs Berita Nasional Malaysia] (''in Indonesian'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Pontianaks are usually depicted as pale-skinned women with long black hair, red eyes, and white dress smeared in blood, but they are said to be able to take on a beautiful humanly appearance since they prey on men and helpless people. They can also be beasts due to their bloodthirsty and carnivorous nature.

In folklore, a pontianak usually arises at full moon and announces her presence through high-pitched baby cries. If the cry is soft, it means that the pontianak is near, and if it is loud, then she must be far. Some believe that if ones hears a dog howling at night, that means the pontianak is far, but if a dog is whining, that means the pontianak is nearby. Her presence can sometimes be detected by a nice floral fragrance identifiable as that of the [[plumeria]], followed by an awful stench (resembling that of a decaying body) afterwards. The Indian version, the Churail, can be identified by her feet turning backwards just before her transformation into her vampiric form. 

A pontianak kills her victims by digging into their stomach with her sharp fingernails and devouring their body organs. In some cases where the pontianak desires revenge against a male individual, the beast rips out the body organs with her hands. It is said that if one has his or eyes open when a pontianak is near, she will suck them out of the victim's head. Pontianak locates her preys/victims by sniffing out the hanging laundry outside. For this reason, some Malaysians refuse to leave any piece of clothing outside of their house overnight.

The pontianak is associated with [[banana]] trees, and her spirit is said to reside in them during the day.

To fend off a pontianak, a nail should be plunged into the hole on the nape of her neck. This is said to make her turn into a beautiful woman and a good wife until the nail is removed. In the case of the kuntilanak, the nail is plunged into the apex of her head.

The Indonesian kuntilanak is similar to the pontianak, but commonly takes the form of a bird and sucks the blood of virgins and young women. The bird, which makes a "ke-ke-ke" sound as it flies, may be sent through some black magic to make a woman fell sick, the characteristic symptom is vaginal bleeding. In her female form, when a man approaches her, she suddenly turns and reveals that her back is hollow, but this apparition is more specifically referred to [[sundel bolong]].

==Sightings==
There are numerous sightings of the Pontianak/Lang suir all over South East Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia. In August 2010 there was a  video caught by a group of Malaysian Policeman [[PDRM]] in the town of Bentong, Pahang, Malaysia. The 2-minute-long video does not show the apparition of the Pontianak at all in her full form.&lt;ref&gt;Chandran83.

A '''puerperal disorder''' or '''postpartum disorder''' is a [[Disease|disorder]] which presents primarily during the puerperium, or [[postpartum period]]. The postpartum period can be divided into three distinct stages; the initial or acute phase, 6–12 hours after childbirth; subacute postpartum period, which lasts 2–6 weeks, and the delayed postpartum period, which can last up to 6 months.&lt;ref name="Romano_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Romano M, Cacciatore A, Giordano R, La Rosa B | title = Postpartum period: three distinct but continuous phases | journal = Journal of Prenatal Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 22–5 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 22439056 | pmc = 3279173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the subacute postpartum period, 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem.&lt;ref name="Glazener_1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glazener CM, Abdalla M, Stroud P, Naji S, Templeton A, Russell IT | title = Postnatal maternal morbidity: extent, causes, prevention and treatment | journal = British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology | volume = 102 | issue = 4 | pages = 282–7 | date = April 1995 | pmid = 7612509 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.1995.tb09132.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson JF, Roberts CL, Currie M, Ellwood DA | title = Prevalence and persistence of health problems after childbirth: associations with parity and method of birth | journal = Birth (Berkeley, Calif.) | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–94 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12051189 | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-536X.2002.00167.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long term health problems (persisting after the delayed postpartum period) are reported by 31% of women.&lt;ref name="Borders_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Borders N | title = After the afterbirth: a critical review of postpartum health relative to method of delivery | journal = Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 242–248 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16814217 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmwh.2005.10.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) describes the postpartum period as the most critical and yet the most neglected phase in the lives of mothers and babies; most maternal and/or newborn deaths occur during the postpartum period.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/postnatal-care-recommendations/en/ | title=WHO recommendations on postnatal care of the mother and newborn | publisher=WHO | access-date=22 December 2014 | author=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical disorders ==
=== Diastasis recti ===
[[Diastasis recti]] is a gap between the two sides of the [[rectus abdominis muscle]] that can occur in the antenatal and postnatal periods.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benjamin|first1=D.R.|last2=Van de Water|first2=A.T.M|last3=Peiris|first3=C.L.|date=March 2014|title=Effects of exercise on diastasis of the rectus abdominis muscle in the antenatal and postnatal periods: a systematic review|journal=Physiotherapy|volume=100|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1016/j.physio.2013.08.005|pmid=24268942}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This condition has no associated morbidity or mortality.&lt;ref name="Norton, Jeffrey A. 2003 350"&gt;{{cite book|title=Essential practice of surgery: basic science and clinical evidence|author=Norton, Jeffrey A.|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn=0-387-95510-0|location=Berlin|pages=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment is physiotherapy.

{{Main|Postpartum bleeding}}Primary postpartum haemorrhage is blood loss following childbirth of more than 500ml (minor) or 1000ml (major) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178/epdf|deadurl=no|volume=124|pages=e106–e149|doi=10.1111/1471-0528.14178|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214002449/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178/epdf|archivedate=2017-02-14|website=RCOG}} Secondary postpartum haemorrhage&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary postpartum haemorrhage is abnormal or excessive bleeding after 24 hours and before 12 weeks postnatally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178/epdf|deadurl=no|volume=124|pages=e106–e149|doi=10.1111/1471-0528.14178|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214002449/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.14178/epdf|archivedate=2017-02-14|website=RCOG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incontinence ===
[[Urinary incontinence]] and [[fecal incontinence]] have been linked to all methods of childbirth, with the incidence of urinary incontinence at 6 months postpartum being 3-7% and fecal incontinence 1-3%.&lt;ref name="Borders 2006" /&gt;

===Infection===
[[Postpartum infections]], also known as childbed fever and puerperal fever, are any bacterial [[infection]]s of the [[female reproductive tract]] following [[childbirth]] or [[miscarriage]]. Signs and symptoms usually include a [[fever]] greater than 38.0&amp;nbsp;°C (100.4&amp;nbsp;°F), chills, lower abdominal pain, and possibly bad-smelling [[vaginal discharge]]. It usually occurs after the first 24 hours and within the first ten days following delivery.

=== Mastitis ===
Puerperal [[mastitis]] is inflammation of the breast usually associated with [[breastfeeding]]. Symptoms typically include local pain and redness.&lt;ref name="Ob2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berens|first1=PD|date=December 2015|title=Breast Pain: Engorgement, Nipple Pain, and Mastitis.|journal=Clinical obstetrics and gynecology|volume=58|issue=4|pages=902–14|doi=10.1097/GRF.0000000000000153|pmid=26512442}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is often an associated [[fever]] and general soreness.&lt;ref name="Ob2016" /&gt; Onset is typically fairly rapid and usually occurs within the first few months of delivery.&lt;ref name="Ob2016" /&gt; Complications can include [[abscess]] formation.&lt;ref name="AFP2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer|first1=JP|date=15 September 2008|title=Management of mastitis in breastfeeding women.|journal=American Family Physician|volume=78|issue=6|pages=727–31|pmid=18819238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peripartum cardiomyopathy ===
[[Peripartum cardiomyopathy]] is decrease in heart function which occurs in the last month of pregnancy, or up to 6 months post-pregnancy. It increases the risk of [[congestive heart failure]], heart [[arrhythmias]], [[thromboembolism]], and [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearson|first=G. D.|last2=Veille|first2=J.

It affects about 5% of all women within a year after giving birth.

=== Pelvic organ prolapse ===
[[Pelvic organ prolapse]] occurs when the [[uterus]], [[bladder]] and/or [[rectum]] drop lower in the pelvis creating a bulge in the [[vagina]]. Approximately half of all women who have given birth experience  some degree of pelvic organ prolapse, most frequently as they age and go through [[menopause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hysterectomy-association.org.uk/information/why-do-i-need-a-hysterectomy/prolapse/|title=Pelvic organ prolapse|work=Hysterectomy Association|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Postpartum depression ===
[[Postpartum depression]] is a moderate to severe depressive episode starting anytime during pregnancy or within the four weeks following delivery. It occurs in 4-20% of pregnancies, depending on its definition.&lt;ref name="Borders 2006" /&gt;  Without treatment, postpartum depression can last for months or years. In addition to affecting the mother’s health, it can interfere with her ability to connect with and care for her baby and may cause the baby to have problems with sleeping, eating, and behavior as he or she grows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Postpartum Depression Facts|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/postpartum-depression-facts/index.shtml|website=National Institute of Mental Health|accessdate=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 38% of the cases of postpartum depression, women are still depressed 3 years postpartum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vliegen N.|author2=Casalin S.|author3=Luyten P.|year=2014|title=The course of postpartum depression: a review of longitudinal studies|url=http://journals.lww.com/hrpjournal/Abstract/2014/01000/The_Course_of_Postpartum_Depression___A_Review_of.1.aspx|deadurl=no|journal=Harvard Review of Psychiatry|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1097/hrp.0000000000000013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709152407/http://journals.lww.com/hrpjournal/Abstract/2014/01000/The_Course_of_Postpartum_Depression___A_Review_of.1.aspx|archivedate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 0.2% of pregnancies, postpartum depression leads to [[postpartum psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sit D.|author2=Rothschild A.

The [[Quaternary]] period (from 2.588 ± 0.005 million years ago to the present) saw the [[extinction]]s of numerous predominantly [[megafauna]]l species, which resulted in a collapse in faunal density and diversity and the extinction of key ecological strata across the globe. The most prominent event in the [[Late Pleistocene]] is differentiated from previous Quaternary [[Turnover-pulse hypothesis|pulse extinctions]] by the widespread absence of [[ecological succession]] to replace these extinct species, and the [[regime shift]] of previously established faunal relationships and habitats as a consequence. 

The earliest casualties were incurred at [[Eemian|130,000 BCE]] (the [[Eemian|start]] of the Late Pleistocene). However, the great majority of extinctions in [[Afro-Eurasia]] and the [[Americas]] occurred during the transition from the [[Pleistocene]] to the [[Holocene]] epoch (13,000 BCE to 8,000 BCE). This extinction wave did not stop at the end of the Pleistocene, continuing, especially on isolated islands, in [[Holocene extinction|human-caused extinctions]], although there is debate as to whether these should be considered separate events or part of the same event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History|last=Kolbert|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9780805092998|title-link=The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pleistocene or Ice Age extinction event==
{{See also|Timeline of extinctions in the Holocene}}The Late Pleistocene extinction event saw the extinction of many mammals weighing more than 40 kg. The proportional rate of megafauna extinctions is consecutively larger the greater the human migratory distance from Africa.
* In [[Subsaharan Africa]], 8 of 50 (16%) [[Genus|genera]] of mammalian megafauna were driven to extinction.
* In [[Asia]], 24 of 46 (52%)
* In [[Europe]], 23 of 39 (59%)
* In [[Australasia]], 19 of 27 (71%)
* In [[North America]], 45 of 61 (74%)
* In [[South America]],  58 of 71 (82%)
The extinctions in the [[Americas]] entailed the elimination of all the larger (over 1000 kg) mammalian species of South American origin, including those that had migrated north in the [[Great American Interchange]]. Only in the continents of Australia, North America, and South America did the extinction occur at family taxonomic levels or higher.

The proportional rate of megafauna extinctions being incrementally bigger the larger the migratory distance from Africa might be related to non-African megafauna and ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' not having evolved as species alongside each other.

For their part, Australia, North America and South America, which respectively had the highest incremental extinction rates, had no known native species of [[Hominoidea]] (apes) at all, and specifically no species of [[Hominidae]] (greater apes) or [[Homo]].
The increased rate of extinction mirrors the sequential pattern of the migration of anatomically modern humans. The further away from Africa, the more recently the area has been inhabited by humans, and the less time the environments (including its megafauna) had had to become accustomed to humans and vice versa.

There is no evidence of megafaunal extinctions at the height of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], indicating that increasing cold and glaciation were not factors.&lt;ref name="cooper20152"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rabanus-Wallace|first1=M.

* The animals died off due to [[climate change]] associated with the advance and retreat of major [[ice caps]] or [[ice sheets]].
* The animals were exterminated by humans: the "prehistoric overkill hypothesis" (Martin, 1967).&lt;ref name="Updating Martin 20082"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillespie|first1=Richard|year=2008|title=Updating Martin's global extinction model|url=|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=27|issue=27–28|pages=2522–2529|bibcode=2008QSRv...27.2522G|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2008.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The extinction of the [[woolly mammoth]] (by whatever cause, perhaps by humans) changed the extensive grasslands to birch forests, and subsequent forest fires then changed the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grayson|first1=Donald K.|last2=Meltzer|first2=David J.|date=2002|journal=Journal of World Prehistory|title=Clovis Hunting and Large Mammal Extinction: A Critical Review of the Evidence|volume=16|issue=4|pages=313–359|doi=10.1023/A:1022912030020}}&lt;/ref&gt; We now know that immediately after the extinction of the mammoth, birch forests replaced the grasslands and that an era of significant fire began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doughty|first1=Christopher E.|last2=Wolf|first2=Adam|last3=Field|first3=Christopher B.|date=August 2010|title=Biophysical feedbacks between the Pleistocene megafauna extinction and climate: The first human-induced global warming?|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=37|issue=15|pages=n/a|bibcode=2010GeoRL..3715703D|doi=10.1029/2010GL043985}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are some inconsistencies between the current available data and the prehistoric overkill hypothesis. For instance, there are ambiguities around the timing of sudden extinctions of [[Australian megafauna]].&lt;ref name="Updating Martin 20082" /&gt; Biologists note that comparable extinctions have not occurred in [[Africa]] and [[South Asia|South]] or [[Southeast Asia]], where the fauna evolved with hominids. Post-glacial megafaunal extinctions in Africa have been spaced over a longer interval.

Evidence supporting the prehistoric overkill hypothesis includes the persistence of certain island megafauna for several millennia past the disappearance of their continental cousins. [[Megalocnus|Ground sloths]] survived on the [[Antilles]] long after North and South American ground sloths were extinct. The later disappearance of the island species correlates with the later colonization of these islands by humans. Similarly, woolly mammoths died out on remote [[Wrangel Island]] 1,000 years after their extinction on the mainland. [[Steller's sea cow]]s also persisted in seas off the isolated and uninhabited [[Commander Islands]] for thousands of years after they had vanished from the continental shores of the north Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Paul K.|date=July 1995|title=Competition, Predation, and the Evolution and Extinction of Steller's Sea Cow, ''Hydrodamalis Gigas''|journal=Marine Mammal Science|volume=11|issue=3|pages=391–4|doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.1995.tb00294.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative hypotheses to the theory of human responsibility include [[climate change]] associated with the [[last glacial period]] and the [[Younger Dryas event]], as well as [[Tollmann's hypothetical bolide]], which claim that the extinctions resulted from [[bolide]] impact(s). Such a scenario has been proposed as a contributing cause of the 1,300-year cold period known as the [[Younger Dryas]] stadial. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This impact extinction hypothesis is still in debate due to the exacting field techniques required to extract minuscule particles of extraterrestrial impact markers such as [[iridium]] at a high resolution from very thin strata in a repeatable fashion, as is necessary to conclusively distinguish the event peak from the local background level of the marker.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The debate seems to be exacerbated by infighting between the [[Uniformitarianism]] camp and the [[Catastrophism]] camp.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

This geography spans the entirety of the [[Continental Europe|European continent]], and stretches into [[North Asia|Northern Asia]], through the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]] to [[North China|Northern China]], [[Siberia]] and [[Beringia]]. During the [[Late Pleistocene]], this region was noted for its great diversity and dynamism of [[biome]]s, including the warm climes of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean basin]], open [[Woodland|temperate woodlands]], [[Plain|arid plains]], [[Heath|mountainous heathland]] and [[swamp]]y [[wetland]]s, all of which were vulnerable to the severe climatic fluctuations of the interchanges between glacial and interglacials periods ([[stadial]]s). However, it was the expansive [[mammoth steppe]] which was the [[Ecoregion|ecosystem]] which united and defined this region during the Late Pleistocene.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahlke|first=Ralf-Dietrich|date=2014|title=The origin of Eurasian Mammoth Faunas (''Mammuthus''-''Coelodonta'' Faunal Complex)|url=http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/140/1404659577.pdf|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=96|pages=32–49|bibcode=2014QSRv...96...32K|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2013.01.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key features of Europe's Late Pleistocene climate was the often [[Turnover-pulse hypothesis|drastic turnover of conditions and biota]] between the numerous stadials, which could set within a century. For example, during glacial periods, the entire [[North Sea]] was drained of water to form [[Doggerland]]. The final major cold spell occurred from 25,000 BCE to 18,000 BCE, and is known as the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], when the Fenno-Scandinavian ice sheet covered much of [[Last Glacial Maximum refugia|northern Europe]], while the Alpine ice sheet occupied significant parts of central-southern Europe.

At the edges of these large stretches of grassland could be found more [[Shrub-steppe|shrub-like]] terrain and [[Cold semi-arid climate|dry]] [[Pinophyta|conifer]] [[forest]]s and [[woodland]] (akin to [[forest steppe]] or [[taiga]]). The browsing collective of megafauna included [[woolly rhinoceros]], [[Giant deer]], [[moose]], ''[[Cervalces latifrons|Cervalces]]'', [[tarpan]], [[aurochs]], [[Bison|woodland bison]], [[camel]]s and smaller deer (''[[Siberian roe deer|Capreolus]]'', ''[[Cervus]]'', ''[[Siberian musk deer|Moschus]]''). [[Brown bear]]s, [[wolverine]]s, [[cave bear]], [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[lynx]], [[leopard]]s, and [[red fox]]es also inhabited this biome. [[Tiger]]s were at stages also present, from the edges of [[Eastern Europe]] around the [[Black Sea]] to [[Beringia]]. The more [[Montane ecosystems|mountainous terrain]], incorporating [[Montane grasslands and shrublands|montane grasslands]], [[Subalpine zone|subalpine conifer forests]], [[alpine tundra]] and [[Schrofen|broken, craggy slopes]], was occupied by several species of mountain-going animals like [[argali]], [[chamois]], [[Capra (genus)|ibex]], [[mouflon]], [[pika]], [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[leopard]]s, [[Ursus (genus)|''Ursus sp.'']] and [[lynx]], with [[snow leopard]]s, Baikal yak and [[snow sheep]] in [[North Asia|Northern Asia]]. [[Arctic tundra]], which lined the north of the mammoth steppe, reflected modern ecology with species such as the [[polar bear]], [[Tundra wolf|wolf]], [[reindeer]] and [[muskox]].

Other biomes, although less noted, were significant in contributing to the diversity of fauna in Late Pleistocene Europe. Warmer grasslands such as [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|temperate steppes]] and [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub|Mediterranean savannahs]] hosted ''[[Stephanorhinus]],'' [[gazelle]], [[European bison]], [[Asian ostrich]]es, ''[[Leptobos]]'', [[cheetah]]s, and [[onager]].

During the last 60,000 years, including the end of the [[last glacial period]], approximately 51 genera of large mammals have become extinct in [[North America]]. Of these, many genera extinctions can be reliably attributed to a brief interval of 11,500 to 10,000 [[radiocarbon]] years [[before present]], shortly following the arrival of the [[Clovis people]] in North America.

Previous North American extinction pulses had occurred at the end of glaciations, but not with such an ecological imbalance between large mammals and small ones. (Moreover, previous extinction pulses were not comparable to the Quaternary extinction event; they involved primarily species replacements within ecological niches, while the latter event resulted in many ecological niches being left unoccupied). Such include the last native North American terror bird (''[[Titanis]]''), rhinoceros (''[[Aphelops]]'') and hyena (''[[Chasmaporthetes]]'').

The survival of bison into the Holocene and recent times is therefore inconsistent with the overkill scenario. By the end of the Pleistocene, when humans first entered North America, these large animals had been geographically separated from intensive human hunting for more than 200,000 years. Given this enormous span of geologic time, bison would almost certainly have been very nearly as naive as native North American large mammals.

The culture that has been connected with the wave of extinctions in North America is the paleo-Indian culture associated with the [[Clovis culture|Clovis people]] (''q.v.''), who were thought to use [[Atlatl|spear throwers]] to kill large animals. The chief criticism of the "prehistoric overkill hypothesis" has been that the human population at the time was too small and/or not sufficiently widespread geographically to have been capable of such ecologically significant impacts. This criticism does not mean that [[climate change scenario]]s explaining the extinction are automatically to be preferred by default, however, any more than weaknesses in climate change arguments can be taken as supporting overkill. Some form of a combination of both factors could be plausible, and overkill would be a lot easier to achieve large-scale extinction with an already dying population due to climate change.

Lack of [[Domestication|tameable]] megafauna was perhaps one of the reasons why [[Native American (Americas)|Amerindian civilizations]] evolved differently from [[Old World]] ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies|author=Diamond, J.|publisher=WW Norton|year=1997|isbn=978-0-393-06131-4|title-link=Guns, Germs, and Steel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have disputed this by arguing that [[llama]]s, [[alpaca]]s, and [[bison]] were domesticated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=After the Ice Age: the return of life to glaciated North America|author=Pielou, EC|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-226-66812-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no general agreement on where the [[Holocene]], or [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], extinction begins, and the Quaternary extinction event which includes climate change resulting in the end of the last [[ice age]] ends, or if they should be considered separate events at all.&lt;ref name="Doughty, C.

Overall, the Holocene extinction can be characterised by the [[human impact on the environment]]. The Holocene extinction continues into the 21st century, with [[overfishing]], [[ocean acidification]] and the [[Decline in amphibian populations|amphibian crisis]] being a few broader examples of an almost universal, cosmopolitan decline of biodiversity.

==Hunting hypothesis==
{{original research|section|date=December 2010}}
[[Image:Hunting Woolly Mammoth.jpg|right | 300px |thumb | A [[Woolly Mammoth]] hunt  ]]

The hunting hypothesis suggests that humans hunted [[megaherbivore]]s to extinction, which in turn caused the extinction of carnivores and scavengers which had preyed upon those animals.&lt;ref name="Martin1963"&gt;{{cite book | author = Martin P. S. | year = 1963 | title = The last 10,000 years: A fossil pollen record of the American Southwest | location = Tucson, AZ | publisher = Univ. Ariz.

Arizona Press | isbn = 978-0-8165-1100-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this hypothesis holds Pleistocene humans responsible for the megafaunal extinction. One variant, known as ''blitzkrieg'', portrays this process as relatively quick. Some of the direct evidence for this includes: fossils of some megafauna found in conjunction with human remains, embedded arrows and tool cut marks found in megafaunal bones, and European [[cave paintings]] that depict such hunting. [[biogeography|Biogeographical]] evidence is also suggestive: the areas of the world where humans evolved currently have more of their Pleistocene megafaunal diversity (the [[elephant]]s and [[Rhinoceros|rhinos]] of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]) compared to other areas such as [[Australia]], the [[Americas]], [[Madagascar]] and [[New Zealand]] without the earliest humans. A picture arises of the megafauna of Asia and Africa evolving alongside humans, learning to be wary of them, and in other parts of the world the wildlife appearing [[Island tameness|ecologically naive]] and easier to hunt.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} This is particularly true of island fauna, which display a disastrous lack of fear of humans.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Of course, it is impossible to demonstrate this naïveté directly in ancient fauna.

Circumstantially, the close correlation in time between the appearance of humans in an area and extinction there provides weight for this scenario. The megafaunal extinctions covered a vast period of time and highly variable climatic situations. The earliest extinctions in Australia were complete approximately 50,000 BP, well before the last glacial maximum and before rises in temperature. The most recent extinction in New Zealand was complete no earlier than 500 BP and during a period of cooling. In between these extremes megafaunal extinctions have occurred progressively in such places as North America, South America and Madagascar with no climatic commonality. The only common factor that can be ascertained is the arrival of humans.&lt;ref name = "Martin"&gt;{{cite book

This phenomenon appears even within regions. The mammal extinction wave in Australia about 50,000 years ago coincides not with known climatic changes, but with the arrival of humans. In addition, large mammal species like the giant kangaroo ''[[Protemnodon]]'' appear to have succumbed sooner on the Australian mainland than on Tasmania, which was colonised by humans a few thousand years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Diamond J |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=Palaeontology: The last giant kangaroo |journal=Nature |volume=454 |pages=835–6 |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/454835a |pmid=18704074 |issue=7206 |bibcode = 2008Natur.454..835D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Turneya CS, Flannery TF, Roberts RG, Reid C, Fifield LK, Higham TF, Jacobs Z, Kemp N, Colhoun EA, Kalin RM, Ogle N |title=Late-surviving megafauna in Tasmania, Australia, implicate human involvement in their extinction |journal=Proc.

Worldwide, extinctions seem to follow the migration of humans and to be most severe where humans arrived most recently and least severe where humans originated — in Africa (see figure "March of Man" below). This suggests that prey animals and human hunting ability evolved together, so the animals evolved avoidance techniques. As humans migrated throughout the world and became more and more proficient at hunting, they encountered animals that had evolved without the presence of humans. Lacking the fear of humans that African animals had developed, animals outside of Africa were easy prey for human hunting techniques. It also suggests that this is independent of climate change.

Extinction through human hunting has been supported by archaeological finds of [[mammoths]] with projectile points embedded in their skeletons, by observations of modern naïve animals allowing hunters to approach easily&lt;ref name = "Eaters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diamond1984"&gt;{{cite book | author = Diamond, J. | year = 1984 |chapter=Historic extinctions: a Rosetta stone for understanding prehistoric extinctions |title=Quaternary extinctions: A prehistoric revolution |editor= Martin, P.S. |editor2=Klein, R.G. | pages = 824–62 | location = Tucson, AZ | publisher = Univ.

===Overkill hypothesis===
[[File:Extinctions Africa Austrailia NAmerica Madagascar.gif|300px|thumb|right|The timing of extinctions follows the "March of Man"]]
The overkill hypothesis, a variant of the hunting hypothesis, was proposed 40 years ago by [[Paul S. Martin]], Professor of Geosciences Emeritus at the Desert Laboratory of the [[University of Arizona]].

===Objections to the hunting hypothesis===
The major objections to the theory are as follows:
* In predator-prey models it is unlikely that predators could over-hunt their prey, since predators need their prey as food to sustain life and to reproduce.&lt;ref name="May2001"&gt;{{cite book | author = May, R. M. | year = 2001 | title = Stability and complexity in model ecosystems | location = Princeton | publisher = Princeton Univ. Press | isbn = 978-0-691-08861-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism has been rejected by many ecologists because humans have the widest dietary choice of any predator and are perfectly capable of switching to alternative prey or even plant foods when any prey species becomes rare. Humans have indisputably hunted numerous species to extinction, which renders any argument that human predators can never hunt prey to extinction immediately invalid.
* There is no archeological evidence that in North America megafauna other than mammoths, mastodons, [[gomphothere]]s and bison were hunted, despite the fact that, for example, camels and horses are very frequently reported in fossil history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grayson | first1 = D.K. | last2 = Meltzer | first2 = D.J. | year = 2003 | title = A requiem for North American overkill | url = | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 30 | issue = 5| pages = 585–593 | doi=10.1016/s0305-4403(02)00205-4| citeseerx = 10.1.1.399.1153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overkill proponents, however, say this is due to the fast extinction process in North America and the low probability of animals with signs of butchery to be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Fiedel, S., Haynes, G., 2004. A premature burial: comments on Grayson and Meltzer’s ''Requiem for overkill'' Journal of Archaeological Science 31, 121–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, biochemical analyses have shown that Clovis tools were used in butchering horses and camels.&lt;ref name="ClovisToolCache"&gt;{{cite web

Those that preserve bone are considerably more rare, and of those, only a very few show unambiguous evidence of human hunting of any type of prey whatsoever."
* A small number of animals that were hunted, such as a single species of [[bison]], did not go extinct. This cannot be explained by proposing that surviving bison in North America were recent Eurasian immigrants that were familiar with human hunting practices, since ''Bison'' first appeared in North America approximately 240,000 years ago&lt;ref name="Belletal.200422"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ScottandCox200822"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandersetal.200922"/&gt; and then evolved into living bison.&lt;ref name="Shapiro, B., et al. 2004 1561–156522"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilsom, M.C., L.V.

* The dwarfing of animals is not explained by overkill. Numerous authors{{Who|date=April 2011}}, however, have pointed out that dwarfing of animals is perfectly well explained by humans selectively harvesting the largest animals, and have provided proof that even within the 20th century numerous animal populations have reduced in average size due to human hunting.
* Eurasian Pleistocene megafauna became extinct in roughly same time period despite having a much longer time to adapt to hunting pressure by humans. However, the extinction of the Eurasian megafauna can be viewed as a result of a different process than that of the American megafauna. This makes the theory less parsimonious since another mechanism is required. The latter case occurred after the sudden appearance of modern human hunters on a land mass they had never previously inhabited, while the former case was the culmination of the gradual northward movement of human hunters over thousands of years as their technology for enduring extreme cold and bringing down big game improved. Thus, while the hunting hypothesis does not necessarily predict the rough simultaneity of the north Eurasian and American megafaunal extinctions, this simultaneity cannot be regarded as evidence against it.
* Eugene S. Hunn points out that the birthrate in hunter-gatherer societies is generally too low, that too much effort is involved in the bringing down of a large animal by a hunting party, and that in order for hunter-gatherers to have brought about the extinction of megafauna simply by hunting them to death, an extraordinary amount of meat would have had to have been wasted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nadasdy, Paul |title=Transcending the Debate over the Ecologically Noble Indian: Indigenous Peoples and Environmentalism |journal=Ethnohistory |volume=52 |issue=2 |year=2006 | doi = 10.1215/00141801-52-2-291 |pages=291–331}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that those who advocate the overkill hypothesis simply have not considered the differences in outlook between typical forager (hunter-gatherer) cultures and the present-day industrial cultures which exist in modernized human societies; waste may be tolerated and even encouraged in the latter, but is not so much in the former. It may be noted that in relatively recent human history, for instance, the Lakota of North America were known to take only as much bison as they could use, and they used virtually the whole animal—this despite having access to herds numbering in the millions.&lt;ref&gt;Svenson, Sally. "[http://www.northern.edu/natsource/mammals/bison1.htm Bison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913021817/http://www.northern.edu/natsource/MAMMALS/Bison1.htm |date=2008-09-13 }}."

Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; featured indiscriminate killing of a herd. However, Hunn's comments are in reference to the now largely discredited theory of [[Balance of nature|hunter-prey equilibrium]] reached after thousands of years of coexistence. It is not relevant to hunters newly arrived on a virgin land mass full of easily taken big game. The well-established practice of industrial-scale moa butchering by the early Maori, involving enormous wastage of less choice portions of the meat, indicates that these arguments are incorrect.&lt;ref name = "Eaters"&gt;{{cite book

* The hypothesis that the [[Clovis culture]] represented the first humans to arrive in the New World has been disputed recently. (See [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|Settlement of the Americas]].) However, they were certainly the first to leave abundant widespread evidence of their presence.

==Climate change hypothesis==

At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, when scientists first realized that there had been glacial and [[interglacial]] ages, and that they were somehow associated with the prevalence or disappearance of certain animals, they surmised that the termination of the Pleistocene [[ice age]] might be an explanation for the extinctions.

Critics object that since there were [[:Image:Five Myr Climate Change.png|multiple]] glacial [[:Image:Atmospheric CO2 with glaciers cycles.gif|advances and withdrawals]] in the evolutionary history of many of the megafauna, it is rather implausible that only after the last glacial maximum would there be such extinctions. However, this criticism is rejected by a recent study indicating that terminal Pleistocene megafaunal community composition may have differed markedly from faunas present during earlier interglacials, particularly with respect to the great abundance and geographic extent of Pleistocene ''Bison'' at the end of the epoch.&lt;ref name="Scott2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Scott, E. | year = 2010 | title = Extinctions, scenarios, and assumptions: Changes in latest Pleistocene large herbivore abundance and distribution in western North America | journal = Quat. Int. | doi = 10.1016/j.quaint.2009.11.003 | volume = 217 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 225–239 |bibcode = 2010QuInt.217..225S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the survival of megafaunal populations during earlier interglacials is essentially irrelevant to the terminal Pleistocene extinction event, because bison were not present in similar abundance during any of the earlier interglacials.

Some evidence weighs against climate change as a valid hypothesis as applied to Australia. It has been shown that the prevailing climate at the time of extinction (40,000–50,000 BP) was similar to that of today, and that the extinct animals were strongly adapted to an arid climate. The evidence indicates that all of the extinctions took place in the same short time period, which was the time when humans entered the landscape. The main mechanism for extinction was probably fire (started by humans) in a then much less fire-adapted landscape. Isotopic evidence shows sudden changes in the diet of surviving species, which could correspond to the stress they experienced before extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Thylacoleo — The Beast of the Nullarbor |series=Catalyst |credits=Willis, Paul; Bryce, Clay; Searle, Mike |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |airdate=17 August 2006 |transcripturl=http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s1717424.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prideaux GJ, Long JA, Ayliffe LK, etal |title=An arid-adapted middle Pleistocene vertebrate fauna from south-central Australia |journal=Nature |volume=445 |issue=7126 |pages=422–5 |date=January 2007 |pmid=17251978 |doi=10.1038/nature05471 |bibcode = 2007Natur.445..422P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roberts RG, Flannery TF, Ayliffe LK, etal |title=New ages for the last Australian megafauna: continent-wide extinction about 46,000 years ago |journal=Science |volume=292 |issue=5523 |pages=1888–92 |date=June 2001 |pmid=11397939 |doi=10.1126/science.1060264 |bibcode = 2001Sci...292.1888R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence in Southeast Asia, in contrast to Europe, Australia, and the Americas, suggests that climate change and an increasing sea level were significant factors in the extinction of several herbivorous species. Alterations in vegetation growth and new access routes for early humans and mammals to previously isolated, localized ecosystems were detrimental to select groups of fauna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Louys |first=Julien |author2=Curnoe, D. |author3=Tong, H. |title=Characteristics of Pleistocene megafauna extinctions in Southeast Asia |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |date=2007 |volume=243 |issue=1–2 |pages=152–173 |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2006.07.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence obtained from analysis of the tusks of [[American mastodon|mastodons]] from the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|American Great Lakes region]] appears inconsistent with the climate change hypothesis. Over a span of several thousand years prior to their extinction in the area, the mastodons show a trend of declining age at maturation. This is the opposite of what one would expect if they were experiencing stresses from deteriorating environmental conditions, but is consistent with a reduction in intraspecific competition that would result from a population being reduced by human hunting.&lt;ref name = "Fisher"&gt;{{Cite book

=== Increased temperature ===
The most obvious change associated with the termination of an ice age is the increase in temperature. Between 15,000 [[Before Present|BP]] and 10,000 BP, a 6 °C increase in global mean annual temperatures occurred. This was generally thought to be the cause of the extinctions.

According to this hypothesis, a temperature increase sufficient to melt the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin ice sheet]] could have placed enough thermal stress on cold-adapted mammals to cause them to die. Their heavy fur, which helps conserve body heat in the glacial cold, might have prevented the dumping of excess heat, causing the mammals to die of heat exhaustion. Large mammals, with their reduced [[Surface area to volume ratio|surface area-to-volume ratio]], would have fared worse than small mammals.

A study covering the past 56,000 years indicates that rapid warming events with temperature changes of up to 16 °C (29 °F) had an important impact on the extinction of megafauna. Ancient DNA and radiocarbon data indicates that local genetic populations were replaced by others within the same species or by others within the same genus. Survival of populations was dependent on the existence of [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] and long distance dispersals, which may have been disrupted by human hunters.&lt;ref name=cooper2015/&gt;

=== Arguments against the temperature hypothesis ===
Studies propose that the annual mean temperature of the current interglacial that we have seen for the last 10,000 years is no higher than that of previous interglacials, yet some of the same large mammals survived similar temperature increases. Therefore, warmer temperatures alone may not be a sufficient explanation.&lt;ref name="Andersen1973"&gt;{{cite conference | author = Andersen, S.

In addition, numerous species such as mammoths on [[Wrangel Island]]&lt;ref name="Vartanyan1995"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vartanyan, S.L., Arslanov, K.A., Tertychnaya, T.V. &amp; Chernov, S.B. | year = 1995 | title = Radiocarbon dating evidence for mammoths on Wrangel Island, Arctic Ocean, until 2000 BC | journal = Radiocarbon | volume = 37 | pages = 1–6 | url = https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/viewFile/1640/1644}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|St. Paul Island]] survived in human-free [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] despite changes in climate. This would not be expected if climate change were responsible (unless their maritime climates offered some protection against climate change not afforded to coastal populations on the mainland). Under normal ecological assumptions island populations should be more vulnerable to extinction due to climate change because of small populations and an inability to migrate to more favorable climes.

=== Increased continentality affects vegetation in time or space ===
Other scientists have proposed that increasingly extreme weather—hotter summers and colder winters—referred to as "[[continentality]]", or related changes in rainfall caused the extinctions. The various hypotheses are outlined below.

====Vegetation changes: geographic====
It has been shown that vegetation changed from mixed [[woodland]]-[[aspen parkland|parkland]] to separate [[prairie]] and woodland.&lt;ref name="Birks1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Birks &amp; Birks1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1976"/&gt; This may have affected the kinds of food available. Shorter growing seasons may have caused the extinction of large herbivores and the dwarfing of many others. In this case, as observed, bison and other large [[ruminant]]s would have fared better than horses, elephants and other [[monogastric]]s, because ruminants are able to extract more nutrition from limited quantities of high-[[Dietary fiber|fiber]] food and better able to deal with [[anti-herbivory toxin]]s.&lt;ref name="Guthrie1988"&gt;{{cite book | author = Guthrie, R. D. | year = 1988 | title = Frozen Fauna of the Mammoth Steppe: The Story of Blue Babe | publisher = University Of Chicago Press | isbn = 978-0-226-31122-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guthrie1989"&gt;{{cite book | author = Guthrie, R.

====Rainfall changes: time====
Increased continentality resulted in reduced and less predictable rainfall limiting the availability of plants necessary for energy and nutrition.&lt;ref name="Bryson1970" &gt;{{cite book | author = Bryson, R.A., Baerreis, D.A., Wendland, W.M. | year = 1970 |chapter=The character of late-glacial and post-glacial climatic changes |title=Pleistocene and recent environments of the central Great Plains |editor=Dort Jr., W. |editor2=Jones, Jr. J.K. |id=Univ.

This could disproportionately harm large animals, since they have longer, more inflexible mating periods, and so may have produced young at unfavorable seasons (i.e., when sufficient food, water, or shelter was unavailable because of shifts in the growing season). In contrast, small mammals, with their shorter [[Biological life cycle|life cycles]], shorter [[reproductive cycle]]s, and shorter [[gestation]] periods, could have adjusted to the increased unpredictability of the climate, both as individuals and as species which allowed them to synchronize their reproductive efforts with conditions favorable for offspring survival. If so, smaller mammals would have lost fewer offspring and would have been better able to repeat the reproductive effort when circumstances once more favored offspring survival.&lt;ref name="Kilti1988"&gt;{{cite book | author = Kilti, R.

In 2017 a study looked at the environmental conditions across Europe, Siberia and the Americas from 25,000–10,000 YBP. The study found that prolonged warming events leading to deglaciation and maximum rainfall occurred just prior to the transformation of the rangelands that supported megaherbivores into widespread wetlands that supported herbivore-resistant plants. The study proposes that moisture-driven environmental change led to the megafaunal extinctions and that Africa's trans-equatorial position allowed rangeland to continue to exist between the deserts and the central forests, therefore fewer megafauna species became extinct there.&lt;ref name=cooper2015&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/s41559-017-0125|pmid=28812683|title=Megafaunal isotopes reveal role of increased moisture on rangeland during late Pleistocene extinctions|journal=Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=1|issue=5|page=0125|year=2017|last1=Rabanus-Wallace|first1=M.

* Megaherbivores have prospered at other times of continental climate. For example, megaherbivores thrived in Pleistocene [[Siberia]], which had and has a more continental climate than Pleistocene or modern (post-Pleistocene, interglacial) North America.&lt;ref name="Flereov1967"&gt;{{cite book | author = Flereov, C.C. | year = 1967 | chapter = On the origin of the mammalian fauna of Canada |title=The Bering Land Bridge |editor=Hopkins, D.M. | pages = 271–80 | location = Palo Alto | publisher = Stanford Univ.

* The animals that became extinct actually should have prospered during the shift from mixed woodland-parkland to prairie, because their primary food source, grass, was increasing rather than decreasing.&lt;ref name="Birks and West1973"&gt;{{cite conference | author = Birks, H.J.B., West, R.G. | year = 1973 | booktitle = Quaternary plant ecology: the 14&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; symposium of the British Ecological society, University of Cambridge, 28–30 March 1972 | location = Oxford | publisher = Blackwell Scientific | isbn = 0-632-09120-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonald1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonald 1981"&gt;{{cite book | author = McDonald, J. | year = 1981 | title = North American Bison: Their classification and evolution | location = Berkeley | publisher = Univ.

This criticism ignores the increased abundance and broad geographic extent of Pleistocene ''Bison'' at the end of the Pleistocene, which would have increased competition for these resources in a manner not seen in any earlier interglacials.&lt;ref name="Scott2010"/&gt;
* Although horses became extinct in the New World, they were successfully reintroduced by the Spanish in the 16th century—into a modern post-Pleistocene, interglacial climate. Today there are [[feral]] horses still living in those same environments. They find a sufficient mix of food to avoid toxins, they extract enough nutrition from forage to reproduce effectively and the timing of their gestation is not an issue. Of course, this criticism ignores the obvious fact that present-day horses are not competing for resources with ground sloths, mammoths, mastodons, camels, llamas, and bison. Similarly, mammoths survived the Pleistocene Holocene transition on isolated, uninhabited islands in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]&lt;ref name="Burney1993"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Burney, D.

* Large mammals should have been able to migrate, permanently or seasonally, if they found the temperature too extreme, the breeding season too short, or the rainfall too sparse or unpredictable.&lt;ref name="Pennycuick1979"&gt;{{cite book | author = Pennycuick, C.J. | year = 1979 |chapter= Energy costs of locomotion and the concept of "Foraging radius" |title=Serengetti: Dynamics of an Ecosystem |editor1=Sinclair A.R.E. |editor2=Norton-Griffiths M. | pages = 164–85 | location = Chicago | publisher = Univ.

By migrating away from the [[equator]], herbivores could have found areas with growing seasons more favorable for finding food and breeding successfully. Modern-day [[African elephant]]s migrate during periods of [[drought]] to places where there is apt to be water.&lt;ref name="Wing &amp; Buss1970"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wing, L.D., Buss, I.O. | year = 1970 | title = Elephants and Forests | journal = Wildl.

The extinction of the megafauna could have caused the disappearance of the [[mammoth steppe]]. Alaska now has low nutrient soil unable to support bison, mammoths, and horses. R. Dale Guthrie has claimed this as a cause of the extinction of the megafauna there; however, he may be interpreting it backwards. The loss of large herbivores to break up the permafrost allows the cold soils that are unable to support large herbivores today. Today, in the arctic, where trucks have broken the permafrost grasses and diverse flora and fauna can be supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kershaw, G.P. |chapter=Tundra plant communities of the Mackenzie mountains, Northwest Territories; floristic characteristics of long term surface disturbances |editor=Olson, R. |editor2=Hastings, R. |editor3=Geddes, F. |title=Northern Ecology and Resource Management: Memorial Essays honoring Don Gill |publisher=Univ.

Possibly, the extinction of the megafauna and the corresponding loss of dung is what led to low nutrient levels in modern-day soil and therefore is why the landscape can no longer support megafauna.

== Arguments against both climate change and overkill ==
It may be observed that neither the overkill nor the climate change hypotheses can fully explain events: [[Herbivory|browsers]], mixed feeders and non-ruminant grazer species suffered most, while relatively more ruminant grazers survived.&lt;ref name="Ruminants: Anatomy, Behavior and Diseases"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whitney-Smith |first1=Elin |chapter=The Evolution of an Ecosystem: Pleistocene Extinctions |chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237242493_The_Evolution_of_an_Ecosystem_Pleistocene_Extinctions |editor-last1=Minai |editor-first1=Ali A. |editor-last2=Bar-Yam |editor-first2=Yaneer |title=Unifying themes in complex systems IV proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Complex Systems |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-73849-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a broader variation of the overkill hypothesis may predict this, because changes in vegetation wrought by either Second Order Predation (see below)&lt;ref name="WhitneySmith2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whitney-Smith |first1=Elin |chapter=Creating the tiniest bison: A system dynamics model of ecological evolution |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286116200 |editor-last1=Mendes |editor-first1=Ricardo Evandro |title=Ruminants: Anatomy, Behavior, and Diseases |date=2012 |publisher=Nova Biomedical |isbn=9781620810644}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] fire preferentially selects against browse species.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Hyperdisease hypothesis==

=== Theory ===

The hyperdisease hypothesis attributes the extinction of large mammals during the late Pleistocene to indirect effects of the newly arrived [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal humans]].&lt;ref name="MacPhee&amp;Marx1997"&gt;{{cite book |author1=MacFee, R.D.E. |author2=Marx, P.A. |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1997 |chapter= Humans, hyperdisease and first-contact extinctions |title=Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar |editor= Goodman, S. |editor2=Patterson, B.D. | location = Washington D.C. | publisher = Smithsonian Press | pages = 169–217 | isbn = 978-1-56098-683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacPhee&amp;Marx1998"&gt;{{cite web |author1=MacFee, R.D.E. |author2=Marx, P.A. |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1998 | title = Lightning Strikes Twice: Blitzkrieg, Hyperdisease, and Global Explanations of the Late Quaternary Catastrophic Extinctions | publisher = American Museum of Natural History | url = http://www.amnh.biz/science/biodiversity/extinction/Day1/bytes/MacPheePres.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Ross D.E. | last = MacPhee |author2=Preston Marx | title = The 40,000-year Plague: Humans, Hyperdisease, and First-Contact Extinctions | booktitle = Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar | pages = 169–217 | publisher = Smithsonian Institution Press | year = 1997 | location = Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hyperdisease Hypothesis proposes that humans or animals traveling with them (e.g., chickens or domestic dogs) introduced one or more highly [[virulent]] diseases into vulnerable populations of native mammals, eventually causing extinctions. The extinction was biased toward larger-sized species because smaller species have greater resilience because of their life history traits (e.g., shorter gestation time, greater population sizes, etc.). Humans are thought to be the cause because other earlier immigrations of mammals into North America from Eurasia did not cause extinctions.&lt;ref name="MacPhee&amp;Marx1997"/&gt;

Diseases imported by people have been responsible for extinctions in the recent past; for example, bringing avian [[malaria]] to Hawaii has had a major impact on the isolated birds of the island.

If a disease was indeed responsible for the end-Pleistocene extinctions, then there are several criteria it must satisfy (see Table 7.3 in MacPhee &amp; Marx 1997). First, the [[pathogen]] must have a stable [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]] state in a reservoir species. That is, it must be able to sustain itself in the environment when there are no susceptible [[Host (biology)|hosts]] available to infect. Second, the pathogen must have a high infection rate, such that it is able to infect virtually all individuals of all ages and sexes encountered. Third, it must be extremely lethal, with a mortality rate of c. 50–75%. Finally, it must have the ability to infect multiple host species without posing a serious threat to humans. Humans may be infected, but the disease must not be highly lethal or able to cause an [[epidemic]].

One suggestion is that pathogens were transmitted by the expanding [[human]]s via the domesticated [[dog]]s they brought with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fiedel, S |title=Man's best friend: mammoth's worst enemy? |journal=World Archaeology |volume=37 |pages=11–35 |year=2005 |doi=10.1080/0043824042000329540}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for such a theory it can not account for several major extinction events, notably Australia and North America. Dogs did not arrive in Australia until approximately 35,000 years after the first humans arrived and approximately 30,000 years after the megafaunal extinction was complete and as such can not be implicated. In contrast numerous species including wolves, mammoths, camelids and horses had emigrated continually between Asia and North America over the past 100,000 years. For the disease hypothesis to be applicable in the case of the Americas it would require that the population remain immunologically naive despite this constant transmission of genetic and pathogenic material.

===Arguments against the hyperdisease hypothesis===
* Generally speaking, disease has to be very virulent to kill off all the individuals in a [[genus]] or [[species]]. Even such a virulent disease as [[West Nile Virus]] is unlikely to have caused extinction.&lt;ref name="Lyons et al2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lyons, K, Smith, F.A., Wagner, P.J., White, E.P., and Brown, J.H. | year = 2004 | title = Was a 'hyperdisease' responsible for the late Pleistocene megafaunal extinction? | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = 859–68 | url = http://biology.unm.edu/fasmith/Web_Page_PDFs/Lyons_et_al_2004_WN.pdf | doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00643.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The disease would need to be implausibly selective while being simultaneously implausibly broad. Such a disease needs to be capable of killing off wolves such as ''Canis dirus'' or goats such as ''Oreamnos harringtoni'' while leaving other very similar species (''Canis lupus'' and ''Oreamnos americanus'', respectively) unaffected. It would need to be capable of killing off flightless birds while leaving closely related flighted species unaffected. Yet while remaining sufficiently selective to afflict only individual species within genera it must be capable of fatally infecting across such clades as birds, [[marsupial]]s, [[placental]]s, [[testudines]], and [[crocodilian]]s. No disease with such a broad scope of fatal infectivity is known, much less one that remains simultaneously incapable of infecting numerous closely related species within those disparate clades.

==Second-order predation==
[[File:CombinedHypothesisPleistoceneExtinction.gif|150px|thumb|right|Combination Hypotheses: Climate Change, Overkill + Climate Change, Second-Order Predation + Climate Change]]
[[File:SingleHypothesisPleistoceneExtinctions.gif|150px|thumb|left|Overkill Hypothesis and Second-Order Predation]]

=== Scenario ===
The Second-Order Predation Hypothesis says that as humans entered the New World they continued their policy of killing predators, which had been successful in the Old World but because they were more efficient and because the fauna, both herbivores and carnivores, were more naive, they killed off enough carnivores to upset the [[Ecological equilibrium|ecological balance]] of the continent, causing [[overpopulation (biology)|overpopulation]], environmental exhaustion, and environmental collapse. The hypothesis accounts for changes in animal, plant, and human populations.

The scenario is as follows:
* After the arrival of ''H. sapiens'' in the New World, existing predators must share the prey populations with this new predator. Because of this competition, populations of original, or first-order, predators cannot find enough food; they are in direct competition with humans.
* Second-order predation begins as humans begin to kill predators.
* Prey populations are no longer well controlled by predation. Killing of nonhuman predators by ''H. sapiens'' reduces their numbers to a point where these predators no longer regulate the size of the prey populations.
* Lack of regulation by first-order predators triggers [[Boom and bust|boom-and-bust]] cycles in prey populations. Prey populations expand and consequently overgraze and over-browse the land. Soon the environment is no longer able to support them. As a result, many herbivores starve. Species that rely on the slowest recruiting food become extinct, followed by species that cannot extract the maximum benefit from every bit of their food.
* Boom-bust cycles in herbivore populations change the nature of the vegetative environment, with consequent climatic impacts on relative humidity and continentality. Through overgrazing and overbrowsing, mixed parkland becomes grassland, and climatic [[continentality]] increases.

=== Support ===
This has been supported by a computer model, the Pleistocene Extinction Model (PEM), which, using the same assumptions and values for all variables (herbivore population, herbivore recruitment rates, food needed per human, herbivore hunting rates, etc.) other than those for hunting of predators. It compares the Overkill hypothesis (predator hunting = 0) with Second-Order Predation (predator hunting varied between 0.01 and 0.05 for different runs). The findings are that Second Order-Predation is more consistent with extinction than is Overkill&lt;ref name="WhitneySmith2004"&gt;{{cite book | author = Whitney-Smith, E. | year = 2004 |chapter= Late Pleistocene extinctions through second-order predation |title=Settlement of the American Continents: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Human Biogeography |editor= Barton, C.M. |editor2=Clark, G.A. |editor3=Yesner, D.R. | location = Tucson, AZ | publisher = University of Arizona Press | isbn = 978-0-8165-2323-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WhitneySmith2009"&gt;{{cite book | author = Whitney-Smith, E. | year = 2009 | title = The Second-Order Predation Hypothesis of Pleistocene Extinctions: A System Dynamics Model | location = Saarbruken, Germany | publisher = [[VDM Verlag]] | isbn = 978-3-639-11579-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (results graph at left).

The PEM is the only test of multiple hypotheses and is the only model to specifically test combination hypotheses by artificially introducing sufficient climate change to cause extinction. When Overkill and Climate Change are combined they balance each other out. Climate Change reduces the number of plants, Overkill removes animals, therefore fewer plants are eaten. Second-Order Predation combined with Climate Change exacerbates the effect of Climate Change.&lt;ref name="WhitneySmith2006"&gt;{{cite book | author = Whitney-Smith, E. | year = 2006 | title = Clovis and Extinctions – Overkill, Second Order Predation, Environmental Degradation in a Non-equilibrium Ecosystem "Clovis Age Continent" | publisher = University of New Mexico Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; (results graph at right).

The second-order predation hypothesis is supported by the observation above that there was a massive increase in bison populations.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, E. (2010). "Extinctions, scenarios, and assumptions: Changes in latest Pleistocene large herbivore abundance and distribution in western North America". Quat. Int.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second-order predation and other theories ===
* '''Climate Change''': Second-Order Predation accounts for the changes in vegetation, which in turn may account for the increase in continentality. Since the extinction is due to destruction of habitat it accounts for the loss of animals not hunted by humans. Second-Order Predation accounts for the dwarfing of animals as well as extinctions since animals that could survive and reproduce on less food would be selectively favored.
* '''Hyperdisease''': The reduction of carnivores could have been from distemper or other carnivore disease carried by domestic dogs.
* '''Overkill''': The observation that extinctions follow the arrival of humans is consistent with the Second-Order Predation hypothesis.

=== Arguments against the second-order predation hypothesis ===
* The model specifically assumes high extinction rates in grasslands, but most [[extinction|extinct]] [[species]] ranged across numerous vegetation zones. Historical population densities of ungulates were very high in the Great Plains; savanna environments support high ungulate diversity throughout Africa, and extinction intensity was equally severe in forested environments.
* It is unable to explain why large herbivore populations were not regulated by surviving carnivores such as grizzly bears, wolves, pumas, and jaguars whose populations would have increased rapidly in response to the loss of competitors.
* It does not explain why almost all extinct carnivores were large herbivore specialists such as sabre toothed cats and short faced bears, but most hypocarnivores and generalized carnivores survived.
* There is no historical evidence of boom and bust cycles causing even local extinctions in regions where large mammal predators have been driven extinct by hunting. The recent hunting out of remaining predators throughout most of the United States has not caused massive vegetational change or dramatic boom and bust cycles in ungulates.
* It is not spatially explicit and does not track predator and prey species separately, whereas the multispecies overkill model does both.
* The multispecies model produces a mass extinction through indirect competition between herbivore species: small species with high reproductive rates subsidize predation on large species with low reproductive rates.&lt;ref name="Alroy2001"/&gt; All prey species are lumped in the Pleistocene Extinction Model.
* Everything explained by the Pleistocene Extinction Model also is explained by the multispecies model, but with fewer assumptions, so the Pleistocene Extinction Model appears less parsimonious. However, the multispecies model does not explain shifts in vegetation, nor is it able to simulate alternative hypotheses. The multispecies model therefore necessitates additional assumptions and hence is less parsimonious.

=== Arguments against the second-order predation plus climate hypothesis ===
* It assumes decreases in vegetation due to climate change, but deglaciation doubled the habitable area of North America.
* Any vegetational changes that did occur failed to cause almost any extinctions of small vertebrates, and they are more narrowly distributed on average.

==Comet hypothesis==
{{Main|Younger Dryas impact event}}
First publicly presented at the Spring 2007 joint assembly of the [[American Geophysical Union]] in Acapulco, Mexico, the [[Younger Dryas event|comet hypothesis]] suggests that the mass extinction was caused by a swarm of comets 12,900 years ago. Using [[photomicrograph]] analysis, research published in January 2009 has found evidence of [[nanodiamonds]] in the soil from six sites across North America including Arizona, Minnesota, Oklahoma, South Carolina and two Canadian sites. Similar research found nanodiamonds in the [[Greenland ice sheet]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2009-01-01-mammothimpact_N.htm Study links mammoth extinction, comets], [[USA Today]], Updated 1/2/2009.

===Arguments against/for the comet hypothesis===
Debate around this hypothesis has included, among other things, the lack of an impact crater, relatively small increased level of [[iridium]] in the soil, and the relative probability of such an event. That said, it took 10 years after publication of the Alvarez theory before scientists found the Chicxulub crater. If the bolide struck the Laurentide ice sheet as hypothesized by Firestone et al. (2007), we would not see the typical impact crater..

Known as the "King of the Party Records", he performed on [[Redd Foxx#Discography|more than 50 records]] in his lifetime. He also starred in ''[[Sanford (TV series)|Sanford]]'', ''[[The Redd Foxx Show]]'' and ''[[The Royal Family (TV series)|The Royal Family]]''.

During the show's five year run, Foxx won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and received an additional three nominations, along with three [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redd Foxx|url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/person/redd-foxx|website=GoldenGlobes.org|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redd Foxx|url=http://www.emmys.com/bios/redd-foxx|website=Emmys.com|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]]|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Redd Foxx was born John Elroy Sanford on December 9, 1922 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and raised in [[South Side, Chicago|Chicago's South Side]]. His father, Fred Sanford, an [[electrician]] and auto mechanic from [[Hickman, Kentucky]], left his family when Foxx was four years old. He was raised by his half-[[Seminole]] mother, Mary Hughes, from [[Ellisville, Mississippi]], his grandmother and his [[Minister of religion|minister]]. Foxx attended [[DuSable High School]] in Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood with future [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago mayor]] [[Harold Washington]]. Foxx had an older brother, Fred Jr., who provided the name for his character on ''Sanford and Son''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a7vcX2uNPK4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=Redd+Foxx+%22draft%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7u4RT4m3KoHd0QHg1tDGAw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=rechristened%20Fred&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; On July 27, 1939, Foxx performed on the [[Major Bowes Amateur Hour]] radio show as part of the Jump Swinging Six.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In the 1940s, he met Malcolm Little, later known as [[Malcolm X]]. In [[The Autobiography of Malcolm X|Malcolm's autobiography]], Foxx is referred to as "Chicago Red, the funniest dishwasher on this earth." He earned the nickname because of his reddish hair and complexion.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; During [[World War II]], Foxx dodged the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|draft]] by eating half a bar of soap before his physical, a trick that resulted in [[palpitation|heart palpitations]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a7vcX2uNPK4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=Redd+Foxx+%22draft%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7u4RT4m3KoHd0QHg1tDGAw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Redd%20Foxx%20%22draft%22&amp;f=false Black and Blue: The Redd Foxx Story]&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, 1946, Foxx recorded five songs for the [[Savoy Records|Savoy label]] under the direction of [[Teddy Reig]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Career==
===Nightclub act===
Foxx gained notoriety with his raunchy [[nightclub]] act. After performing on the East Coast, his big break came after singer [[Dinah Washington]] insisted that he come to [[Los Angeles]], where [[Dootsie Williams]] of Dootone records caught his act at the Brass Rail nightclub. Foxx was one of the first black comics to play to white audiences on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. He was signed to a long-term contract and released a series of comedy albums that quickly became cult favorites.&lt;ref name="People-28Oct1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goodman |first=Mark |author= |authorlink= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |date=October 28, 1991 |year= |month= |title=Redd Foxx exits, laughing|journal=People |volume=36 |series= |issue=16 |page= |pages= |publisher= |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20111147,00.html |accessdate=October 11, 2010 |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sanford and Son''===
{{Main|Sanford and Son}} 
Foxx achieved his most widespread fame starring in the television [[sitcom]] ''Sanford and Son,''&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; an adaptation of the [[BBC]] series ''[[Steptoe and Son]]''. He used his starring role on ''Sanford and Son'' to help get jobs for his acquaintances such as [[LaWanda Page]], [[Slappy White]], [[Gregory Sierra]], [[Don Bexley]], [[Beah Richards]], [[Stymie Beard]], Leroy Daniels, Ernest Mayhand and [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki "Pat" Morita]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The series premiered on the [[NBC|NBC television network]] on January 14, 1972 and was broadcast for six seasons. The final episode aired on March 25, 1977. Foxx played the role of Fred G. Sanford ("Fred Sanford" was actually Foxx's father's and brother's name), while Foxx's co-star [[Demond Wilson]] played the role of his son Lamont. In this sitcom, Fred and Lamont were owners of a junk/salvage store in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] who dealt with many humorous situations that would arise. The series was notable for its [[ethnic joke|racial humor]] and overt [[prejudice]]s which helped [[Sanford and Son#Production notes|redefine the genre]] of [[black sitcom|black situation comedy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The show also had several [[running gag]]s. When angry with Lamont, Fred would often say "You big dummy" or would often fake heart attacks by putting his hand on his chest and saying (usually while looking up at the sky) "It's [[Sanford and Son#The Big One|the big one]], I'm coming to join ya honey/Elizabeth" (referring to his late wife). Fred would also complain about having [[arthritis|"arthur-itis"]] to get out of working by showing Lamont his cramped hand. Foxx depicted a character in his 60s, although in real-life he was a decade younger.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Demond Wilson was asked whether he kept in touch with everybody from ''Sanford &amp; Son'', especially the series' star himself, after the series was canceled: "No. I saw Redd Foxx once before he died, circa 1983, and I never saw him again. At the time I was playing tennis at the Malibu Racquet Club and I was approached by some producers about doing a Redd Foxx 50th Anniversary Special. I hadn’t spoken to him since 1977, and I called the club where (Redd) was playing. And we met at Redd’s office, but he was less than affable. I told those guys it was a bad idea. I never had a cross word with him. People say I’m protective of Redd Foxx in my book (Second Banana, Wilson’s memoir of the Sanford years). I had no animosity toward Foxx for (quitting the show in 1977) because I had a million dollar contract at CBS to do Baby I’m Back. My hurt was that he didn’t come to me about throwing the towel in - I found out in the hallway at NBC from a newscaster. I forgave him and I loved Redd, but I never forgot that. The love was there. You can watch any episode and see that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beachcomberdestin.com/destin/article-966-qa-with-demond-wilson.html|title=Q&amp;A With Demond Wilson|publisher=BeachcomberDestin.com|date=January 15, 2014| accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-''Sanford and Son'' career===
[[File:Redd Foxx 1977.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Photo of Redd Foxx in 1977.]] In 1977, Foxx left ''Sanford and Son'', after six seasons (the show was canceled with his departure) to star in a short-lived ABC [[variety show]]. In 1980 he was back playing [[Fred G. Sanford]] in a short-lived [[revival (television)|revival]]/[[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], ''[[Sanford (TV series)|Sanford]]''. In 1986, he returned to television in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[The Redd Foxx Show]]'', which was cancelled after 12 episodes because of low ratings. Foxx appeared as an ''[[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]''-like character in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' special of the ''[[Donny &amp; Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny &amp; Marie]]'' show. In an homage to his show, he mentioned the planet Sanford, which has no sun. Foxx made a comeback with the series ''[[The Royal Family (TV series)|The Royal Family]]'', in which he co-starred with [[Della Reese]].

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
Redd Foxx was married four times. His first marriage was to Evelyn Killebrew in 1948 and ended in divorce in 1951. His second marriage in 1956 was to Betty Jean Harris, a [[showgirl]] and dancer, who was a colleague of [[LaWanda Page]] (later to be Foxx's TV rival [[Aunt Esther]] on ''[[Sanford and Son]]''). Foxx adopted Harris's nine-year-old daughter Debraca, who assumed the surname "Foxx". This marriage ended in divorce in 1975. Foxx next wed Korean-American Yun Chi Chung in 1976, but the marriage ended in 1981. At the time of his death, Foxx was married to Ka Ho Cho, who used the name Ka Ho Foxx.&lt;ref name="aolnews.com"&gt;[http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/red-foxxs-life-story-is-it-worth-enough-to-settle-his-estates-debt/19383405 Steve Friess, "Trying to Get Foxx's Estate Out of the Redd", AOL News, March 7, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520080623/http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/red-foxxs-life-story-is-it-worth-enough-to-settle-his-estates-debt/19383405 |date=May 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial and tax problems ===
According to ''[[People Magazine]]'', "Foxx reportedly once earned $4 million in a single year, but depleted his fortune with a lavish lifestyle, exacerbated by what he called 'very bad management.{{'"}} Contributing to his problems was a 1981 divorce settlement of $300,000 paid to his third wife. In 1983 he filed for bankruptcy, with proceedings continuing at least through 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116272,00.html ''People Magazine'', December 18, 1989.]&lt;/ref&gt; The IRS filed tax liens against Redd Foxx's property for income taxes he owed for the years 1983 to 1986 totaling $755,166.21.  On November 28, 1989, the IRS seized his home in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and seven vehicles (including a 1927 [[Model T]], a 1975 [[Panther J72]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0dwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=redd+foxx+panther&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X7ryE5doSz&amp;sig=8rk79jLoQczeWXi57Fu7wov7wwc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2hH0S-vqGpC6swP8q5GNDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=redd%20foxx%20panther&amp;f=false ''Ebony'' magazine article (September 1976)]&lt;/ref&gt; a 1983 [[Zimmer (automobile)|Zimmer]], and a [[Vespa|Vespa motor scooter]]) to pay the taxes which by then had grown to $996,630, including penalties and interest. Agents also seized "$12,769 in cash and a dozen guns, including a semiautomatic pistol," among some 300 items in total, reportedly leaving only Foxx's bed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-29/entertainment/ca-299_1_redd-foxx-s-home ''Los Angeles Times'', November 29, 1989.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-06/news/vw-396_1_redd-foxx ''Los Angeles Times'', December 6, 1989.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-05-02/news/9005025492_1_redd-foxx-auctioned-las-vegas Orlando Sentinel May 2, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;
Foxx stated that the IRS "took my necklace and the ID bracelet off my wrist and the money out of my pocket&amp;nbsp;... I was treated like I wasn't human at all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116272,00.html ''People Magazine''], December 18, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that, at the time of his death in 1991, Foxx owed more than $3.6 million in taxes.&lt;ref name="aolnews.com"/&gt;

==Death==
On October 11, 1991, during a break from rehearsals for ''The Royal Family'', he suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onstageandbackstage.wordpress.com/2011/12/09/ill-be-back-the-story-of-redd-foxx/ |title='I’ll Be Back': The Story of Redd Foxx |author= |date=9 December 2011 |work=Onstage &amp; Backstage |publisher= |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ingram&gt;Ingram, Billy, ''TVparty!: Television's Untold Tales'', Bonus Books, 2002, p. 262. {{ISBN|1-56625-184-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Della Reese, Foxx was about to have an interview with ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' when he was called onto the set to practice a scene. An angry Foxx did as he was asked but as soon as he finished he collapsed to the floor. Reese said that nobody initially suspected anything was wrong; Foxx was famous for his fake heart attack shtick on ''Sanford and Son'' and, as Reese recalled, was skilled at doing pratfalls. When Foxx did not immediately get up, Reese rushed over to check on him.&lt;ref&gt;https://blackdoctor.org/486916/della-reese-describes-redd-foxxs-last-breath-and-what-really-killed-him/&lt;/ref&gt; When she leaned down to Foxx as he was on the ground, Foxx said, "Get my wife" repeatedly and went into cardiac arrest.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}  According to Joshua Rich at ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', "It was an end so ironic that for a brief moment cast mates figured Foxx&amp;nbsp;– whose 1970s TV character often faked heart attacks&amp;nbsp;– was kidding when he grabbed a chair and fell to the floor."&lt;ref name="rich1998"&gt;Rich, Joshua (October 9, 1998). [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285162,00.html Exit Laughing.] ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Foxx, who had temporarily been brought back to life while being treated initially, was taken to [[Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center|Queen Of Angels Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center]], where he succumbed to the attack and died that night at the age of 68.&lt;ref name="jet1991"&gt;Staff report (October 28, 1991).

His mother, Mary Carson (1903–1993), outlived Foxx and died two years later, in 1993. She was buried just to the right of her famed son.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Influence==
Comedian and actor [[Richard Pryor]] cited Redd Foxx as an influence.&lt;ref&gt;'Pryor Convictions and Other Life Sentences', by Richard Pryor with Todd Gold.&lt;/ref&gt; "He gave me inspiration and encouragement so I could be more me", Pryor told ''Ebony'' magazine in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-12/local/me-105_1_redd-foxx/2|title=Redd Foxx, TV's 'Sanford,' Dies of Heart Attack at 68 :  Entertainment: Comedian is stricken while rehearsing new show, 'The Royal Family.'|last=MERINA|first=VICTOR|date=1991-10-12|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-11|last2=DIZON|first2=LILY|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[Chris Rock]] cites Redd Foxx as an influence.

==Portrayals of Foxx in popular media==
In 1990, in the first-ever episode of ''[[In Living Color]]'', in reference to Foxx's financial troubles, Foxx was portrayed by [[Damon Wayans]], who is making a public service announcement to encourage people to pay their taxes. In the film ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (film)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]'', Foxx is portrayed by [[Aries Spears]]. He is shown performing a stand-up comedy routine. In the animated television series ''[[Family Guy]]'' parody of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' episode "[[Blue Harvest (Family Guy)|Blue Harvest]]", Redd Foxx appears very briefly as an X-wing pilot. When his ship is shot down, he cries "I'm coming Elizabeth!" before dying. In addition to this, he has been parodied on ''Family Guy'' by [[Francis Griffin (Family Guy)|Francis Griffin]] acting as Foxx's ''Sanford and Son'' character.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Foxx was meant to be featured in the [[MTV]] show ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'', advertised as taking on [[Jamie Foxx]] in the episode "When Animals Attack". Instead of Redd Foxx though, Jamie Foxx fought [[Ray Charles]]. In the ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|Boondocks]]'' episode "[[Stinkmeaner 3: The Hateocracy]]" he is portrayed as Lord Rufus Crabmiser, one of Stinkmeaner's old friends coming to kill the Freeman family. Childhood friend and ''Sanford &amp; Son'' co-star Lawanda Page is also portrayed in the same episode as Lady Esmeralda Gripenasty.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Redd Foxx appears as a minor character in the 2009 ''[[James Ellroy]]'' novel ''[[Blood's a Rover]]''. He gives a bawdy eulogy at the wake of Scotty Bennett, a murdered rogue LAPD detective including the line "Scotty Bennett was fucking a porcupine. I gots to tell you motherfuckers that it was a female porcupine, so I don't see nothing perverted in it."&lt;ref name=ellroy&gt;Ellroy,James. ''Blood's A Rover'', Windmill, p. 597. {{ISBN|978-0-09-953779-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1999 film ''[[Foolish (film)|Foolish]]'' starring comedian [[Eddie Griffin]] and rapper [[Master P]], the ghost of Redd Foxx gives Griffin's character advice from behind a stall door in a men's restroom at a comedy club before he goes onstage to perform a show. In 2015, it was said that comedian [[Tracy Morgan]] would portray Redd Foxx in a Richard Pryor biopic starring opposite comedian [[Mike Epps]].&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2015/film/news/tracy-morgan-redd-foxx-richard-pryor-biopic-1201639576/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reptile''' is a [[Playable character|video game character]] from the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' fighting game franchise created for [[Midway Games]] by [[Ed Boon]] and [[John Tobias]]. He debuted in ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' as a hidden opponent and appeared in subsequent titles as a playable character, also appearing in the merchandise and other media related to the series.

Reptile is a Raptor, a nearly-extinct [[bipedal]] [[Reptilian humanoid|humanoid race of reptilian creatures]] and loyally serves the series' recurring villain [[Shao Kahn]] in hope that his race will be revived. Reptile has been featured in almost every title in the series under the same pretenses, and until the [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|2011 reboot]], he had yet to be rewarded for his efforts. Critical reception to the character has been positive, with many print and online publications commenting on his evolution since his debut as a hidden character.

==Conception and history==
[[File:MK4 Reptile.png|thumb|left|upright|Originally a [[palette swap]] of [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]], Reptile's design evolved as the series progressed.]]

Included in the first game late in the development process, Reptile's character concept was conceived while Boon was driving back to work from lunch. Noting the success of utilizing a [[palette swap]] method for [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]] and [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero's]] character sprites,&lt;ref name="mkad"&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=2006-10-11 |level=Reptile Kombat Card video}}&lt;/ref&gt; he and Tobias decided to include a "super secret hidden feature" in ''Mortal Kombat'', choosing Reptile's green color as a contrast to Scorpion's original yellow and Sub-Zero's blue colors.&lt;ref name="Kent"&gt;Kent, Steve L. (2001). ''The Ultimate History of Video Games''. [[Prima Games]]. {{ISBN|0-7615-3643-4}}. p. 463&lt;/ref&gt; Developed with the premise of being "a cooler version of Scorpion", the character's concept was completed in a single evening.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt2bdW5vagY TMK E308 - MK vs DCU - Ed Boon interview Part 1], (YouTube, [http://www.totalmortalkombat.com/mkvsdcu/e32008/edboon08transcript.txt interview transcript]). Total Mortal Kombat. Retrieved on 2008-12-26&lt;/ref&gt; Reptile's inclusion was intended as a marketing tool for the arcade game: as extreme conditions must be met to encounter Reptile, the designers hoped to rely on word of mouth to spread rumors of the character's existence.&lt;ref name="quarter"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kent, Steve L. |title=The First Quarter: A 25-year History of Video Games|year=2000 |publisher=BWD Press |page=370 |isbn=0-9704755-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the character was not included in the title until version 3.0 of the game.&lt;ref name="audits"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hist_mortalk/p13.html |title=The History of Mortal Kombat - Mortal Kombat (1992)|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|author1=Greeson, Jeff  |author2=O'Neill, Cliff |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=2008-12-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021084618/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hist_mortalk/p13.html|archivedate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reptile's appearance caused fans to speculate that he could be unlocked and used as a controllable character. Boon noted in a later interview that due to the popularity of the rumors surrounding the character, they decided to include Reptile in subsequent installments of the series as a playable fighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat 3]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=1995 |level=Ed Boon and John Tobias interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
Reptile was originally depicted as a tall, muscular, light-skinned humanoid. Due to his origin as a palette swap of [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]] and [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]], his attire was identical to theirs only colored in green. His clothing consists of pants and boots covering his lower body, along with a black sleeveless shirt and open hood. Green light armor covered his forearms and lower legs, while an open V-shaped green vest protected his torso, extending to a matching small [[Faulds (plate armour)|fauld]] and loincloth.&lt;ref name="Kent" /&gt; He wears a green facial mask as part of his [[ninja]] disguise to conceal his true reptilian nature, however he does remove the mask in-game for his [[Acid]] Spit attack or his [[tongue]] grab fatality.&lt;ref name="UMK3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wartow, Ronald |title=Official Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Fighter's Kompanion|year=1996 |publisher=[[BradyGames]]|page=370 |isbn=1-56686-639-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reptile stands 6&amp;nbsp;feet (183&amp;nbsp;cm) tall,&lt;ref name="dabiocard" /&gt; and speaks in a hissing tone.&lt;ref name="mkad" /&gt;

In ''[[Mortal Kombat 4]]'', Reptile's appearance became more reptilian, with his head completely uncovered. His hands became clawed, while his feet were now three-toed talons.&lt;ref name="mk4end" /&gt; By ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance|Deadly Alliance]]'', Reptile had developed a full reptilian head and tail, with gold and black armor to cover his legs, elbows, shoulders, and belt, and he was competely barefoot. Bone spurs extended from the base of his [[skull]] down his spine, ending at the tip of his tail, while a similar spur extended from his heel on each bare foot.&lt;ref name="dabiocard" /&gt; Ed Boon described the changes to Reptile's design over the course of the two games as hinting at him "evolving into a bigger character", and foreshadowing Onaga controlling his body in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception|Deception]]''.&lt;ref name="mkad2" /&gt;

Reptile's appearance in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks|Shaolin Monks]]'' used an amalgam of his three previous designs, intended by character designer Mark Lappin to portray a classic yet fresh feel for the character.&lt;ref name="devd" /&gt; The design incorporated the appearance of his body from ''Mortal Kombat 4'', his clothing from the original ''Mortal Kombat'', and the look of his bare feet, hands, and armor from ''Deadly Alliance''. In addition, black strips of cloth wrapped around his forearms, hands, and head, leaving his eyes,mouth and bare feet exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528175615/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Media/Media.htm?CS_pid=%7B7C3D28D1-B78E-459B-9C48-86481FE2EF9D%7D |archivedate=2006-05-28 |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Media/Media.htm?CS_pid={7C3D28D1-B78E-459B-9C48-86481FE2EF9D} |title=Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks Media |publisher=''[[Game Informer]]'' |accessdate=2008-12-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was later reused as his primary outfit in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon|Armageddon]]'', with his appearance from ''Deadly Alliance'' serving as his secondary outfit.&lt;ref name="mkad" /&gt;

==Appearances==

===In video games===
In the original ''Mortal Kombat'', Reptile is a mysterious hidden enemy character, unplayable and with no biography.&lt;ref name="quarter" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chip |last=Carter |author2= Jonathan, Carter|title= They are just dying to talk about Mortal Kombat |page=5D |date= 1994-02-07 |newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hints regarding the conditions of how to unlock the fight against him are conveyed by Reptile randomly appearing prior to other matches.&lt;ref name="audits" /&gt;  Some of these hints include "Look to La Luna," "Perfection is the key," and "Alone is how to find me."  To fight Reptile, the player must get a Double Flawless victory in single player mode on the Pit stage and finish the match off with a fatality, all without blocking.  There must also be a silhouette flying past the moon, which will occur every sixth game.

In ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'', Reptile returns as a playable character and a member of a reptilian race called Raptors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |platform=[[Wii]] |date=2007-07-15 |level=Fighter of the Wiik: Khameleon}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were pulled into Outworld and enslaved by [[Shao Kahn]].

Instead of the vampire he finds [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Onaga|Onaga's]] dragon egg instead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=2002-11-20 |level=Reptile ending}}&lt;/ref&gt; which transforms Reptile into Onaga's [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]], leading to the events of ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception|Deception]]''&lt;ref name="mkad2"&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=2006-10-11 |level=Onaga Kombat Card video}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ending with his defeat at the game's conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mkarmageddon.com/charBio.html?charName=shujinko|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017105805/http://mkarmageddon.com/charBio.html?charName=shujinko|title=Shujinko bio|publisher=[[Midway Games]]|archivedate=October 17, 2007|accessdate=November 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separated from Onaga as a result, Reptile returns in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]''. In Konquest mode in ''Armageddon'', he appears in the Red Dragon lair commanding Daegon's dragon Caro to close the portal but refused. Taven battles Reptile in combat and emerges victorious.

Reptile also appears in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks]]'', appearing in the game's opening sequence and later as a boss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107202543/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200509/N05.0919.1920.37484.htm |archivedate=2005-11-07 |url= http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200509/N05.0919.1920.37484.htm|date=2005-09-19|title=Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks Hands-On Impressions|publisher=''[[Game Informer]]''|author=Vore, Bryan|accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; During development, producer Shaun Himmerick noted that Reptile was included in the game because the character was one of Himmerick's favorite in the series.&lt;ref name="devd"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mortalkombatonline.com/content/forum/showmessage.cds?id=52997|title=Developer Diary#3: Characters|publisher=Mortal Kombat Online|author=Himmerick, Shaun|accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally included in ''[[NBA Jam Tournament Edition]]'' alongside other ''Mortal Kombat'' characters as an unlockable player, he was eventually removed from later versions of the game at the request of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Staff |title=NBA JAM Tournament Edition Player's Guide|year=1995 |publisher=[[BradyGames]]|isbn=1-56686-232-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reptile reappears in the 2011 ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' video game, retelling his role from the first tournaments. In ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' (2015), Reptile follows Kotal Kahn and helps bring about Mileena's removal from the throne.

====Gameplay====
As a secret character in the first ''Mortal Kombat'', Reptile features a hybrid of Sub-Zero's and Scorpion's attacks, such as the former's freezing projectile and the latter's harpoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Publications International, Ltd|title=Mortal Kombat Action Strategies: An Authorized Player's Guide|year=1993 |publisher=New Amer Library|isbn=0-451-82290-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; When made a playable character for later installments, his moves were changed completely. His "Forceball" attack creates an energy ball from his hands, while his "Acid Spit" attack produces a higher, faster projectile. Reptile can slide towards the opponent, or turn invisible for a brief period of time or until hit.&lt;ref name="MK2g"&gt;{{cite book |author=Taylor, Matt | author2=Fink, Jim|title=Mortal Kombat II: Official Player's Guide|year=1995 |publisher=Infotainment|isbn=1-57280-028-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later titles in the series modify these moves, such as splitting the Forceball attack into slow and fast variants,&lt;ref name="UMK3" /&gt; or remove moves in favor of different attacks, only to return them in the next installment.&lt;ref name="MK4g"&gt;{{cite book |author=Arnold, Douglas |title=Mortal Kombat 4 Survival Guide: Players Guide|year=1998 |publisher=Semantix Design Llc|isbn=1-884364-44-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reptile's [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatalities]] in ''Mortal Kombat II'' consist of revealing his reptilian face in order to devour the opponent's head, or turning invisible and severing the opponent's torso.&lt;ref name="MK2g" /&gt; Later finishing moves expand upon the concept, ranging from [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitating]] acid upon the opponent to leaping upon their body and gnawing the flesh from their skulls.&lt;ref name="UMK3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MK4g" /&gt; In a series retrospective, the ''Mortal Kombat'' development team named Reptile's finishers as some of their favorites from the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] Premium Edition |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=2006-10-11 |level="The History of Fatalities" commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reptile later appears in the 1995 film ''[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' as a [[bipedalism|bipedal]] [[lizard]], camouflaging himself until found by [[Liu Kang]]. After being thrown into a statue, Reptile transforms into a human-looking ninja and battles Liu Kang, but is defeated and then crushed after reverting to his original form. Reptile's lizard form was rendered with the use of [[computer-generated imagery]], while the character's human form is portrayed by [[Keith Cooke]], clothed similar to Scorpion and Sub-Zero in the film, but green and with a fanged open mouth imprinted on his face mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Goldman, Michael  |author2=Aaron, Richard E.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Mortal Kombat: The Movie Behind the Scenes|year=1995 |publisher=[[Prima Games]]|isbn=0-7615-0082-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally not included in the movie, Reptile was added in response to [[focus groups]] being unimpressed with the original fights in the film.&lt;ref name="Black Belt"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Reed| first = Dr. Craig D.| date = 1998-01-01| title = Mortal Kombat: Annihilation - Behind the Scenes at the New Hollywood Blockbuster| journal = [[Black Belt (magazine)|Black Belt]]| volume= 36| issue= 1| pages = 85| publisher = Active Interest Media, Inc.| issn = 0277-3066}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Robin Shou]] (Liu Kang) and director [[Paul W.

The 1998 television series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Konquest]]'' features Reptile in his human form, portrayed by Jon Valera. Commander of Shao Kahn's Raptors, he betrays Kahn and forms an alliance with Kreeya to share dominion over Kahn's domain and serve as one of her [[mating|mates]], only to be killed later during an ambush by Shao Kahn's priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date = 2000 |title = [[Mortal Kombat: Conquest]] |type = [[DVD]] |publisher = [[CTVglobemedia]] |location = Australia |accessdate = 2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar character named Komodai appears in the animated ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm#Episode 3: "Acid Tongue"|Mortal Kombat]]'' series' third episode, leading an attack with other Raptors.

Reptile featured in director [[Kevin Tancharoen]]'s 2010 short film ''[[Mortal Kombat: Rebirth]]'', a grittier, more realistic take on the ''MK'' canon. He was played by Richard Dorton and depicted therein as a [[human cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[crime|criminal]] who eats his victims' heads after killing them. While not an inhuman ninja, the character suffers from a real-life [[disease]] known as [[Harlequin-type ichthyosis]], giving him patchy [[Scale (dermatology)|scale]]-like skin and eyes that are grown inward. Reptile was the only character from the film who did not carry over into Tancharoen's ''[[Mortal Kombat: Legacy]]'' web series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3179728 |title=Mortal Kombat Trailer is Director's Pitch for MK Film |author=Pigna, Kris |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2010-06-09 |work=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/film/article/exclusive-interview-with-mortal-kombat-actor-104127 |title=Exclusive Interview with Mortal Kombat Actor |author=Young, Becky |publisher=[[CraveOnline]] |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''riderless horse''' (which may be [[caparison]]ed in ornamental and protective coverings, having a detailed protocol of their own) is a single horse, without a rider, and with boots reversed in the stirrups, which sometimes accompanies a [[funeral]] procession. The horse follows the [[Caisson (vehicle)|caisson]] carrying the [[coffin|casket]].&lt;ref name="USDofD"&gt;

==History==
[[File:Jousting horse, funeral procession of Archduke Albert VII of Austria.jpeg|thumb|Riderless [[jousting]] horse of [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]] in his funeral procession, 1623 (etching with hand coloring by [[Jacob Franquart]])]]
The custom is believed to date back to the time of [[Genghis Khan]], when a horse was sacrificed to serve the fallen warrior in the next world. The riderless horse later came to symbolize a warrior who would ride no more.&lt;ref name="cnn-riderless"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/05/23/arlington.riderless.horse/| title = Riderless horse adds poignancy to military burials| work = CNN.com| accessdate = 30 March 2014| date=May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the riderless horse is part of the military honors given to an [[United States Army|Army]] or [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] officer who was a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] or above; this includes the [[President of the United States|President]], by virtue of having been the country's commander in chief and the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], having overseen the armed forces. [[Alexander Hamilton]], former Secretary of the Treasury (1789-1795) was the first American to be given the honor. Historian Ron Chernow noted that Hamilton's gray horse followed the casket "with the boots and spurs of its former rider reversed in the stirrups."&lt;ref name=Chernow&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chernow|first1=Ron|title=Alexander Hamilton|date=2004|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59420-009-0|pages= 710–712}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Abraham Lincoln]] was the first president of the United States to be officially honored by the inclusion of the riderless horse in his funeral cortege,&lt;ref name="USDofD" /&gt; although a letter from [[George Washington's]] personal secretary recorded the president's horse was part of the president's funeral, carrying his saddle, pistols, and holsters.&lt;ref name="WHH"&gt;

Traditionally, simple black riding boots are reversed in the stirrups to represent a fallen commander looking back on his troops for the last time.

==Notable horses==

In 1865, Abraham Lincoln was honored by the inclusion of a riderless horse at his funeral. When Lincoln's funeral train reached [[Springfield, Illinois]], his horse, [[Old Bob]], who was draped in a black mourning blanket, followed the procession and led mourners to Lincoln's burial spot.&lt;ref name="bj-america"&gt;

Black Jack was foaled January 19, 1947, and came to [[Fort Myer]] from [[Fort Reno, Oklahoma]], on November 22, 1952. Black Jack was the last of the [[United States Army Quartermaster Corps|Quartermaster]]-issue horses branded with the Army's U.S. brand (on the left shoulder) and his Army serial number 2V56 (on the left side of his neck). He died on February 6, 1976, and was buried on the parade ground of Fort Myer's Summerall Field with full military honors, one of only two US Army horses to be given that honor.&lt;ref&gt;Belcher, Nancy Hoyt, "Arlington Cemetery, Fort Myer pay homage to the military", ''[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]'', Bergen County, N.J.: April 6, 2003. pg.

'''Suna Venter''' was a South African current affairs journalist, fiction writer, and senior [[radio producer]] at the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC). She was one of a group of eight journalists at the SABC that were suspended in 2016 for objecting to the editorial policies implemented by SABC COO [[Hlaudi Motsoeneng]] known as the [[SABC8]]. 

Most notably the policy by the SABC of refusing to air protest footage.  The policy was reversed following a parliamentary enquiry.&lt;ref name="tl"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/2017-06-30-sabc8-journo-suna-venter-dies-of-broken-heart|title=SABC8 journo Suna Venter dies of 'broken heart'|last=MAILOVICH|first=CLAUDI|date=30 June 2017|website=Timeslive|access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following their suspension the journalists including Venter were the victims of numerous death threats, home break-ins and other forms of intimidation to get them to drop a Constitutional Court case against the SABC.&lt;ref name="tl2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/news/2016-09-18-death-threats-spook-sabc-staffers|title=Death threats spook SABC staffers|last=HOFSTATTER|first=STEPHAN|date=18 September 2016|website=Timeslive|access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iol"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/sabc-8-journalist-suna-venter-dies-from-broken-heart-syndrome-10056165|title=SABC 8 journalist Suna Venter dies from 'Broken Heart Syndrome'|date=29 June 2017|website=iol|access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Death==
On 29 June 2017, Venter was found dead in her home in Kelland, Johannesburg. She was 32 years old. Her death is believed to have resulted from stress induced [[cardiomyopathy]] caused by the intimidation attempts against her following her and her colleagues' criticism of Motsoeneng's policies.&lt;ref name="hp"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/06/29/sabc-8-journalist-suna-venter-dead-at-32_a_23008060|title=SABC-8 Journalist Suna Venter Dead At 32|last=Etheridge|first=Jenna|date=29 June 2017|website=Huffington Post|access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] made a statement following her death that she "was a hero of all times."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2017/07/01/suna-venter-was-a-hero|title=SUNA VENTER WAS A HERO|last=Phakgadi|first=Pelane|date=1 July 2017|website=ewn.com|access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others condolences came from included those from South African journalists as well as the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/kathrada-foundation-salutes-suna-venter-slams-blf-threats-10094613|title=Kathrada Foundation salutes Suna Venter, slams BLF threats|access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Right2Know]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politics/blf-also-gupta-cronies--r2k|title=BLF also Gupta cronies|website=politicsweb.co.za|access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/tributes-flow-for-a-jewel---sabc-journalist-suna-venter-10139199|title=Tributes flow for ‘a jewel’|access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/friends-colleagues-bid-farewell-to-brave-fiesty-suna-venter-20170706|title=Friends, colleagues bid farewell to 'brave, fiesty' Suna Venter|work=News24|access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Toba supereruption''' was a [[Supervolcano|supervolcanic]] [[types of volcanic eruptions|eruption]] that occurred about 75,000 years ago at the site of present-day [[Lake Toba]] in [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. It is one of the [[Earth]]'s [[List of largest volcanic eruptions|largest known eruptions]]. The '''Toba catastrophe theory''' holds that this event caused a global [[volcanic winter]] of six to ten years and possibly a 1,000-year-long cooling episode.

In 1993, science journalist Ann Gibbons posited that a [[population bottleneck]] occurred in human evolution about 70,000 years ago, and she suggested that this was caused by the eruption. Geologist [[Michael R. Rampino]] of [[New York University]] and volcanologist Stephen Self of the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] support her suggestion. In 1998, the bottleneck theory was further developed by anthropologist Stanley H. Ambrose of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]. Both the link and global winter theories are highly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-22355515 |title=Toba super-volcano catastrophe idea 'dismissed' |website=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-08}}

==Supereruption==
{{See also|List of large volcanic eruptions}}
The Toba eruption or Toba event occurred at the present location of [[Lake Toba]] in [[Indonesia]], about {{val|75,000|900|u=years}} [[Before Present]] (BP) according to [[potassium argon dating]].&lt;ref&gt;
*{{Harvnb|Ninkovich|others|1978}}.
*{{Harvnb|Chesner|others|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This eruption was the last and largest of four eruptions of Toba during the [[Quaternary]] period, and is also recognized from its diagnostic horizon of ashfall, the youngest Toba [[tuff]] (YTT).&lt;ref&gt;
*{{Harvnb|Chesner|others|1991}}, p. 200; {{Harvnb|Jones|2007}}, p. 174; {{Harvnb|Oppenheimer|2002}}, pp. 1593–1594; {{Harvnb|Ninkovich|others|1978}}
*{{Harvnb|Rose|Chesner|1987}}, p. 913; {{Harvnb|Zielinski|others|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It had an estimated [[volcanic explosivity index]] of 8 (the highest rating of any known eruption on Earth); it made a sizable contribution to the 100×30&amp;nbsp;km [[caldera]] complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oppenheimer|2002}}, p. 1593.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dense-rock equivalent]] (DRE) estimates of eruptive volume for the eruption vary between {{val|2000|u=km³}} and {{val|3000|u=km³}} – the most common DRE estimate is {{val|2800|u=km³}} (about {{val|7|e=15|u=kg}}) of erupted magma, of which {{val|800|u=km³}} was deposited as ash fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|2007}}, p. 174; {{Harvnb|Rose|Chesner|1987}}, p. 913.&lt;/ref&gt;

The erupted mass was 100 times greater than that of the largest volcanic eruption in recent history, the 1815 eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in Indonesia, which caused the 1816 "[[Year Without a Summer]]" in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Petraglia|others|2007}}, p. 114; {{Harvnb|Zielinski|others|1996}}, p. 837.&lt;/ref&gt; Toba's erupted mass deposited an ash layer about {{convert|15|cm|in}} thick over the whole of [[South Asia]]. A blanket of volcanic ash was also deposited over the [[Indian Ocean]], and the [[Arabian Sea]], and [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|2007}}, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Deep-sea cores retrieved from the South China Sea have extended the known reach of the eruption, suggesting that the {{val|2800|u=km³}} calculation of the erupted mass is a minimum value or even an underestimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|2007}}, p. 174; {{Harvnb|Oppenheimer|2002}}. pp. 1593–1596.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volcanic winter and cooling computer models ==
Biologist Michael R. Rampino and volcanologist Stephen Self argue that the eruption caused a "brief, dramatic cooling or 'volcanic winter'", which resulted in a drop of the global mean surface temperature by 3–5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rampino|Self|1993a}}, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from [[Greenland]] [[ice core]]s indicates a 1,000-year period of low [[δ18O|''δ''&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] and increased dust deposition immediately following the eruption. The eruption may have caused this 1,000-year period of cooler temperatures (stadial), two centuries of which could be accounted for by the persistence of the Toba stratospheric loading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zielinski|others|1996}}, pp. 837–840.&lt;/ref&gt; Rampino and Self believe that global cooling was already underway at the time of the eruption, but that the process was slow; YTT "may have provided the extra 'kick' that caused the climate system to switch from warm to cold states".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rampino|Self|1992}}, p. 52; {{Harvnb|Rampino|Self|1993a}}, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Clive Oppenheimer rejects the hypothesis that the eruption triggered the last glaciation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robock|others|2009}} seem to agree on that.&lt;/ref&gt; he agrees that it may have been responsible for a millennium of cool climate prior to the 19th [[Dansgaard-Oeschger event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oppenheimer|2002}}, p. 1606.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alan Robock, who has also published [[nuclear winter]] papers, the Toba eruption did not precipitate the last glacial period. However, assuming an emission of six billion tons of [[sulphur dioxide]], his computer simulations concluded that a maximum global cooling of approximately 15&amp;nbsp;°C occurred for three years after the eruption, and that this cooling would last for decades, devastating life.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- name=robock2009 --&gt;{{Harvnb|Robock|others|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the saturated [[adiabatic lapse rate]] is 4.9&amp;nbsp;°C/1,000 m for temperatures above freezing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00144.html |title=IUPAC Gold Book - adiabatic lapse rate in atmospheric chemistry |publisher=Goldbook.iupac.org |date=2014-02-24 |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[tree line]] and the [[snow line]] were around 3,000 m (9,900&amp;nbsp;ft) lower at this time. The climate recovered over a few decades, and Robock found no evidence that the 1,000-year cold period seen in Greenland ice core records had resulted from the Toba eruption. In contrast, Oppenheimer believes that estimates of a drop in surface temperature by 3–5&amp;nbsp;°C are probably too high, and he suggests that temperatures dropped only by 1&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oppenheimer|2002}}, pp. 1593, 1601.&lt;/ref&gt; Robock has criticized Oppenheimer's analysis, arguing that it is based on simplistic [[Standard score|T-forcing]] relationships.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- name=robock2009 --&gt;{{Harvnb|Robock|others|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these different estimates, scientists agree that a supereruption of the scale at Toba must have led to very extensive ash-fall layers and injection of noxious gases into the atmosphere, with worldwide effects on weather and climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Self|Blake|2008}}, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Greenland ice core data display an abrupt [[climate change]] around this time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zielinski|others|1996}}, p. 837.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no consensus that the eruption directly generated the 1,000-year cold period seen in Greenland or triggered the last glaciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robock|others|2009}} (page?).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical data contradicting the winter hypothesis ===
Archaeologists, led by the University of Cambridge's Dr Christine Lane, in 2013, reported finding a microscopic layer of glassy volcanic ash in sediments of [[Lake Malawi]], and definitively linked the ash to the 75,000-year-old Toba super-eruption, but found no change in fossil type close to the ash layer, something that would be expected following a severe [[volcanic winter]]. They concluded that the largest known volcanic eruption in the history of the human species did not significantly alter the climate of East Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-05-volcanic-winter-toba-super-eruption.html |title=Doubt over 'volcanic winter' after Toba super-eruption. 2013 |publisher=Phys.org |date=2013-05-02 |accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/20/8025.full.pdf |title=Ash from the Toba supereruption in Lake Malawi shows no volcanic winter in East Africa at 75 ka |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-03-28 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1301474110 |volume=110 |issue=20 |date=2013 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |pages=8025–8029 |pmid=23630269 |pmc=3657767 |last1=Lane |first1=CS |last2=Chorn |first2=BT |last3=Johnson |first3=TC|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.8025L }}&lt;/ref&gt; attracting criticism from Richard Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/33/E3047.full |last1=Roberts |first1=RG |last2=Storey |first2=M |last3=Haslamc |first3=M |title=Toba supereruption: Age and impact on East African ecosystems |doi=10.1073/pnas.1308550110 |volume=110 |issue=33 |date=2013 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |page=E3047|pmc=3746893 |bibcode=2013PNAS..110E3047R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane explained, "We examined smear slides at a 2-mm interval, corresponding to subdecadal resolution, and X-ray fluorescence scans run at 200-µm intervals correspond to subannual resolution.

==Genetic bottleneck theory==
The Toba eruption has been linked to a [[genetic bottleneck]] in human evolution about 70,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibbons|1993|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rampino|Self|1993a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which may have resulted from a severe reduction in the size of the total human population due to the effects of the eruption on the global climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ambrose|1998}}, ''passim''; {{Harvnb|Gibbons|1993}}, p. 27; {{Harvnb|McGuire|2007}}, pp. 127–128; {{Harvnb|Rampino|Ambrose|2000}}, pp. 78–80; {{Harvnb|Rampino|Self|1993b}}, pp. 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the genetic bottleneck theory, between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago, human populations sharply decreased to 3,000–10,000 surviving individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ambrose|1998}}; {{Harvnb|Rampino|Ambrose|2000}}, pp. 71, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/1999/supervolcanoes_script.shtml |title=Science &amp; Nature - Horizon - Supervolcanoes |publisher=BBC.co.uk |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is supported by some genetic evidence suggesting that today's humans are descended from a very small population of between 1,000 and 10,000 breeding pairs that existed about 70,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- name=a1998 --&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2975862.stm|title=When humans faced extinction|publisher=BBC|date=2003-06-09|accessdate=2007-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Scientific citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Proponents of the genetic bottleneck theory (including Robock) suggest that the Toba eruption resulted in a global ecological disaster, including destruction of vegetation along with severe drought in the [[tropical rainforest]] belt and in monsoonal regions. For example, a 10-year volcanic winter triggered by the eruption could have largely destroyed the food sources of humans and caused a severe reduction in population sizes.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- name=robock2009 --&gt;{{Harvnb|Robock|others|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Τhese environmental changes may have generated population bottlenecks in many species, including [[hominid]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rampino|Ambrose|2000}}, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; this in turn may have accelerated differentiation from within the smaller human population. Therefore, the genetic differences among modern humans may reflect changes within the last 70,000 years, rather than gradual differentiation over hundreds of thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- name=a1998 --&gt;{{Harvnb|Ambrose|1998}}, pp. 623–651.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has cast doubt on a link between Toba and a genetic bottleneck. For example, ancient [[stone tool]]s in southern India were found above and below a thick layer of ash from the Toba eruption and were very similar across these layers, suggesting that the dust clouds from the eruption did not wipe out this local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mount Toba Eruption – Ancient Humans Unscathed, Study Claims |date=6 July 2007 |url=http://anthropology.net/2007/07/06/mount-toba-eruption-ancient-humans-unscathed-study-claims/ |website=Anthropology.net |accessdate=2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Super-eruption: no problem? |journal=Nature |date=July 2007 |first=Katherine |last=Sanderson |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1038/news070702-15 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070702/full/news070702-15.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207012423/http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070702/full/news070702-15.html |archivedate=December 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=john hawks weblog |date=5 July 2007 |url=http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/archaeology/middle/petraglia_toba_india_continuity_2007.html |title= At last, the death of the Toba bottleneck |author=John Hawks |authorlink=John D. Hawks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional archaeological evidence from southern and northern India also suggests a lack of evidence for effects of the eruption on local populations, leading the authors of the study to conclude, "many forms of life survived the supereruption, contrary to other research which has suggested significant animal extinctions and genetic bottlenecks".&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite web |url=http://anthropology.net/2010/02/25/newly-discovered-archaeological-sites-in-india-reveals-ancient-life-before-toba/ |title=Newly Discovered Archaeological Sites in India Reveals Ancient Life before Toba |date=25 February 2010 |website=Anthropology.net |accessdate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, evidence from pollen analysis has suggested prolonged deforestation in South Asia, and some researchers have suggested that the Toba eruption may have forced humans to adopt new adaptive strategies, which may have permitted them to replace [[Neanderthal]]s and "other archaic human species".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Supervolcano Eruption In Sumatra Deforested India 73,000 Years ago |newspaper=ScienceDaily |date=24 November 2009 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091123142739.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- name=williams2009 --&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|others|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional caveats include difficulties in estimating the global and regional climatic impacts of the eruption and lack of conclusive evidence for the eruption preceding the bottleneck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oppenheimer|2002}}, pp. 1605, 1606.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, genetic analysis of [[Alu sequence]]s across the entire [[human genome]] has shown that the effective human population size was less than 26,000 at 1.2 million years ago; possible explanations for the low population size of human ancestors may include repeated population bottlenecks or periodic replacement events from competing ''[[Homo]]'' subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;If these results are accurate, then, even before the emergence of ''Homo sapiens'' in Africa, ''Homo erectus'' population was unusually small when the species was spreading around the world. See {{Harvnb|Huff|others|2010}}, p.6; {{Harvnb|Gibbons|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic bottlenecks in other mammals===
Some evidence points to genetic bottlenecks in other animals in the wake of the Toba eruption. The populations of the Eastern African [[chimpanzee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldberg|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bornean [[orangutan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steiper|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; central Indian [[Rhesus macaque|macaque]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hernandez|others|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cheetah]], and [[tiger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luo|others|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; all recovered from very low numbers around 70,000–55,000 years ago.

The separation of the nuclear gene pools of eastern and western lowland [[gorilla]]s has been estimated to have occurred about 77,700 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thalman|others|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration after Toba==
The exact geographic distribution of human populations at the time of the eruption is not known, and surviving populations may have lived in [[Africa]] and subsequently migrated to other parts of the world.  Analyses of [[mitochondrial DNA]] have estimated that the [[Recent African origin of modern humans#Exodus from Africa|major migration from Africa]] occurred 60,000–70,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New 'Molecular Clock' Aids Dating Of Human Migration History |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090604124023.htm |work=[[ScienceDaily]] |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; consistent with dating of the Toba eruption to around 75,000 years ago.

==Criticism==
A study by Chad Yost and colleagues of cores from [[Lake Malawi]] dating to the period of the Toba supereruption showed no evidence of a volcanic winter, and they argue that there was no effect on African humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248417302750|title=Subdecadal phytolith and charcoal records from Lake Malawi, East Africa imply minimal effects on human evolution from the ∼74 ka Toba supereruption|author1=Yost, Chad|display-authors=etal|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=March 2018|volume=116|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of [[John D. Hawks|John Hawks]], the study confirms evidence from a variety of studies that the eruption did not have a major climatic effect or any effect on human numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/climate/toba-bottleneck-didnt-happen-2018.html|title=The so-called Toba bottleneck didn't happen|date=9 February 2018|first=John |last=Hawks|website=john hawks weblog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Primary sources|date=April 2011}}

The '''twelve leverage points to intervene in a system''' were proposed by [[Donella Meadows]], a scientist and system analyst focused on environmental limits to economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Meadows |first=Donella |date=2008 |title=Thinking in Systems: A Primer |publisher=[[Chelsea Green Publishing]] |page=145-165 |isbn=978-1-60358-055-7 |author-link=Donella Meadows }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The leverage points, first published in 1997, were inspired by her attendance at a [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) meeting in the early 1990s where she realized that a very large new system was being proposed but the mechanisms to manage it were ineffective.

Meadows, who worked in the field of [[systems analysis]], proposed a scale of places to intervene in a [[system]].  Awareness and manipulation of these levers is an aspect of [[self-organization]] and can lead to [[collective intelligence]].

Her observations are often cited in [[energy economics]], [[green economics]] and [[human development theory]].

She started with the observation that there are levers, or places within a [[complex system]] (such as a firm, a city, an economy, a living being, an [[ecosystem]], an [[ecoregion]]) where a "small shift in one thing can produce big changes in everything" (compare: constraint in the sense of [[Theory of Constraints]]).

She claimed we need to know about these ''shifts'', where they are and how to use them. She said most people know where these points are instinctively, but tend to adjust them in the wrong direction. This understanding would help solve global problems such as [[unemployment]], [[hunger]], [[economic stagnation]], [[pollution]], [[resources depletion]], and [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] issues.

Meadows started with a 9-point list of such places, and expanded it to a list of ''twelve leverage points'' with explanation and examples, for systems in general.

She describes a [[system]] as being in a certain state, and containing a [[Stock and flow|stock]], with inflows (amounts coming into the system) and outflows (amounts going out of the system). At a given time, the system is in a certain perceived state. There may also be a [[goal]] for the system to be in a certain state. The difference between the current state and the goal is the discrepancy.

{{quote|For example, one might consider a [[lake]] or reservoir, which contains a certain amount of water. The inflows are the amount of water coming from rivers, rainfall, drainage from nearby soils, and waste water from a local industrial plant. The outflows might be the amount of water used up for irrigation of nearby cornfield, water taken by that local plant to operate as well as the local camping site, water [[evaporating]] in the [[atmosphere]], and trickling surplus water when the reservoir is full.

Local inhabitants complain about the water level getting low, pollution getting higher, and the potential effect of hot water release in the lake on life (in particular, the fish).

This is the difference between the perceived state (pollution or low water level) and the goal (a non-polluted lake).}}

==Leverage points to intervene in a system==
The following are in increasing order of effectiveness.

=== 12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards) ===

Parameters are points of lowest leverage effects. Though they are the most clearly perceived among all leverages, they rarely change behaviors and therefore have little long-term effect.

{{quote|For example, climate parameters may not be changed easily (the amount of rain, the [[evapotranspiration]] rate, the temperature of the water), but they are the ones people think of first (they remember that in their youth, it was certainly raining more). These parameters are indeed very important. But even if changed (improvement of upper river stream to canalize incoming water), they will not change behavior much (the debit will probably not dramatically decrease).}}

=== 11. The size of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows ===

A [[wiktionary:Buffer|buffer]]'s ability to stabilize a system is important when the stock amount is much higher than the potential amount of inflows or outflows.  In the lake, the water is the buffer:  if there's a lot more of it than inflow/outflow, the system stays stable.

{{quote|For example, the inhabitants are worried the lake fish might die as a consequence of hot water release directly in the lake without any previous cooling off.

However, the water in the lake has a large [[heat capacity]], so it's a strong thermic buffer. Provided the release is done at low enough depth, under the [[thermocline]], and the lake volume is big enough, the buffering capacity of the water might prevent any extinction from excess temperature.}}

Buffers can improve a system, but they are often physical entities whose size is critical and can't be changed easily.

=== 10. Structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport network, population age structures)===

A system's structure may have enormous effect on operations, but may be difficult or prohibitively expensive to change. Fluctuations, limitations, and bottlenecks may be easier to address.

{{quote|For example, the inhabitants are worried about their lake getting polluted, as the industry releases chemical pollutants directly in the water without any previous treatment. The system might need the used water to be diverted to a [[Industrial wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment plant]], but this requires rebuilding the underground used water system (which could be quite expensive).}}

=== 9. Length of delays, relative to the rate of system changes ===

Information received too quickly or too late can cause over- or underreaction, even oscillations.

{{quote|For example, the city council is considering building the wastewater treatment plant. However, the plant will take 5 years to be built, and will last about 30 years. The first delay will prevent the water being cleaned up within the first 5 years, while the second delay will make it impossible to  build a plant with exactly the right capacity.}}

=== 8. Strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the effect they are trying to correct against===

A [[negative feedback]] loop slows down a process, tending to promote stability. The loop will keep the stock near the goal, thanks to parameters, accuracy and speed of information feedback, and size of correcting flows.

{{quote|For example, one way to avoid the lake getting more and more polluted might be through setting up an additional levy on the industrial plant based on measured concentrations of its effluent.  Say the plant management has to pay into a water management fund, on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on the actual amount of waste found in the lake; they will, in this case, receive a direct benefit not just from reducing their waste output, but actually reducing it enough to achieve the desired effect of reducing concentrations in the lake.  They cannot benefit from "doing damage more slowly" -- only from actually helping.  If cutting emissions, even to zero, is insufficient to allow the lake to naturally purge the waste, then they will still be on the hook for cleanup.  This is similar to the US "Superfund" system, and follows the widely accepted "polluter pays" principle.}}

=== 7. Gain around driving positive feedback loops===

A [[positive feedback]] loop speeds up a process. Meadows indicates that in most cases, it is preferable to slow down a positive loop, rather than speeding up a negative one.

{{quote|The [[eutrophication]] of a lake is a typical feedback loop that goes wild. In a eutrophic lake (which means well-nourished), lots of life can be supported (fish included).

An increase of [[nutrient]]s will lead to an increase of productivity, growth of [[phytoplankton]] first, using up as much nutrients as possible, followed by growth of [[zooplankton]], feeding up on the first ones, and increase of fish populations. The more available nutrients there are, the more productivity is increased. As plankton organisms die, they fall to the bottom of the lake, where their matter is degraded by decomposers.

However, this degradation uses up available [[oxygen]], and in the presence of huge amounts of organic matter to degrade, the medium progressively becomes [[hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] (there is no more oxygen available). In time, all oxygen-dependent life dies, and the lake becomes a smelly anoxic place where no life can be supported (in particular no fish).}}

=== 6. Structure of information flow (who does and does not have access to what kinds of information)===

[[Information flow (disambiguation)|Information flow]] is neither a parameter, nor a reinforcing or slowing loop, but a loop that delivers new information. It is cheaper and easier to change information flows than it is to change structure.

:For example, a monthly public report of water pollution level, especially nearby the industrial release, could have a lot of effect on people's opinions regarding the industry, and lead to changes in the waste water level of pollution.

=== 5. Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints)===

Pay attention to rules, and to who makes them.

{{quote|For example, a strengthening of the law related to chemicals release limits, or an increase of the tax amount for any water containing a given pollutant, will have a very strong effect on the lake water quality.}}

=== 4. Power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure===

[[Self-organization]] describes a system's ability to change itself by creating new structures, adding new negative and positive feedback loops, promoting new information flows, or making new rules.

{{quote|For example, microorganisms have the ability to not only change to fit their new polluted environment, but also to undergo an evolution that makes them able to biodegrade or bioaccumulate chemical pollutants. This capacity of part of the system to participate in its own [[eco-evolution]] is a major leverage for change.}}

=== 3. Goal of the system ===
Changing goals changes every item listed above: parameters, feedback loops, information and self-organization.

{{quote|A city council decision might be to change the goal of the lake from making it a free facility for public and private use, to a more [[ecotourism|tourist]] oriented facility or a [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] area. That goal change will effect several of the above leverage points: information on water quality will become mandatory and legal punishment will be set for any illegal effluent.}}

=== 2. Mindset or paradigm that the system &amp;mdash; its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters &amp;mdash; arises from ===

A societal paradigm is an idea, a shared unstated assumption, or a system of thought that is the foundation of complex social structures. Paradigms are very hard to change, but there are no limits to paradigm change. Meadows indicates paradigms might be changed by repeatedly and consistently pointing out anomalies and failures in the current paradigm to those with open minds.

:''A current paradigm is "Nature is a stock of resources to be converted to human purpose". What might happen to the lake were this collective idea changed ?''

=== 1. Power to transcend paradigms===

Transcending paradigms may go beyond challenging fundamental assumptions, into the realm of changing the values and priorities that lead to the assumptions, and being able to choose among value sets at will.

{{quote|Many today see Nature as a stock of resources to be converted to human purpose.  Many Native Americans see Nature as a living god, to be loved, worshipped, and lived with.  These views are incompatible, but perhaps another viewpoint could incorporate them both, along with others.}}

"'''Two Dogmas of Empiricism'''" is a paper by [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] published in 1951.  According to [[City University of New York]] professor of philosophy [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]], this "paper [is] sometimes regarded as the most important in all of [[20th century philosophy|twentieth-century philosophy]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Godfrey-Smith]], ''Theory and Reality'', 2003, [[University of Chicago]], {{ISBN|0-226-30062-5}}, pages 30-33 (section 2.4 "Problems and Changes")&lt;/ref&gt; The paper is an attack on two central aspects of the [[logical positivism|logical positivists']] philosophy. One is the [[analytic–synthetic distinction]] between [[analytic proposition|analytic]] [[truth]]s and [[Synthetic proposition|synthetic]] truths, explained by Quine as truths grounded only in meanings and independent of facts, and truths grounded in facts. The other is [[reductionism]], the theory that each meaningful statement gets its [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] from some [[logic]]al construction of terms that refers exclusively to immediate experience.

"Two Dogmas" has six sections. The first four focus on analyticity, the last two on reductionism. There, Quine turns the focus to the logical positivists' theory of meaning. He also presents his own [[holism|holistic]] theory of meaning.

==Analyticity and circularity==

Most of Quine's argument against analyticity in the first four sections is focused on showing that different explanations of analyticity are circular. The main purpose is to show that no satisfactory explanation of analyticity has been given.

Quine begins by making a distinction between two different classes of analytic statements. The first one is called logically true and has the form:

:(1) No unmarried man is married

A sentence with that form is true independent of the interpretation of "man" and "married", so long as the logical particles "no", "un-" and "is" have their ordinary English meaning.

The statements in the second class have the form:

:(2) No bachelor is married.

A statement with this form can be turned into a statement with form (1) by exchanging [[synonym]]s with synonyms, in this case "bachelor" with "unmarried man". It is the second class of statements that lack characterization according to Quine. The notion of the second form of analyticity leans on the notion of synonymy, which Quine believes is in as much need of clarification as analyticity. Most of Quine's following arguments are focused on showing how explanations of synonymy end up being dependent on the notions of analyticity, necessity, or even synonymy itself.

How do we reduce sentences from the second class to a sentence of the first class? Some might propose ''definitions''. "No bachelor is married" can be turned into "No unmarried man is married" because "bachelor" is defined as "unmarried man". But, Quine asks: how do we find out that "bachelor" is defined as "unmarried man"? Clearly, a dictionary would not solve the problem, as a dictionary is a report of already known synonyms, and thus is dependent on the notion of synonymy, which Quine holds as unexplained.

A second suggestion Quine considers is an explanation of synonymy in terms of interchangeability. Two linguistic forms are (according to this view) synonymous if they are interchangeable  in all contexts without changing the [[truth-value]]. But consider the following example:

:(3) "Bachelor" has fewer than ten letters.

Obviously "bachelor" and "unmarried man" are not interchangeable in that sentence. To exclude that example and some other obvious counterexamples, such as poetic quality, Quine introduces the notion of [[cognitive synonymy]]. But does interchangeability hold as an explanation of cognitive synonymy? Suppose we have a language without [[wikt:Category:English modal adverbs|modal adverbs]] like "necessarily". Such a language would be [[Extension (semantics)|extensional]], in the way that two predicates which are true about the same objects are interchangeable again without altering the truth-value. Thus, there is no assurance that two terms that are interchangeable without the truth-value changing are interchangeable because of meaning, and not because of chance. For example, "creature with a heart" and "creature with kidneys" share extension.

In a language with the modal adverb "necessarily" the problem is solved, as ''[[salva veritate]]'' holds in the following case:

:(4) Necessarily all and only bachelors are unmarried men

while it does not hold for

:(5) Necessarily all and only creatures with a heart are creatures with kidneys.

Presuming that 'creature with a heart' and 'creature with kidneys' have the same extension, they will be interchangeable ''[[salva veritate]]''.  But this interchangeability rests upon both empirical features of the language itself and the degree to which extension is empirically found to be identical for the two concepts, and not upon the sought for principle of cognitive synonymy.

It seems that the only way to assert the synonymy is by supposing that the terms 'bachelor' and 'unmarried man' are synonymous and that the sentence "All and only all bachelors are unmarried men" is analytic.  But for ''salva veritate'' to hold as a definition of something more than extensional agreement, i.e., cognitive synonymy, we need a notion of necessity and thus of analyticity.

So, from the above example, it can be seen that in order for us to distinguish between analytic and synthetic we must appeal to synonymy; at the same time, we should also understand synonymy with interchangeability ''salva veritate''. However, such a condition to understand synonymy is not enough so we not only argue that the terms should be interchangeable, but necessarily so. And to explain this logical necessity we must appeal to analyticity once again.

==Reductionism==

Analyticity would be acceptable if we allowed for the [[verification theory]] of meaning: an analytic statement would be one synonymous with a [[logical truth]], which would be an extreme case of meaning where empirical verification is not needed, because it is "confirmed no matter what". "So, if the verification theory can be accepted as an adequate account of statement synonymy, the notion of analyticity is saved after all."

The problem that naturally follows is how statements are to be verified. An empiricist would say that it can only be done using [[empirical evidence]]. So some form of reductionism - "the belief that each meaningful statement is equivalent to some logical construct upon terms which refer to immediate experience" - must be assumed in order for an empiricist to 'save' the notion of analyticity. Such reductionism, says Quine, presents just as intractable a problem as did analyticity.

In order to prove that all meaningful statements can be translated into a sense-datum language, a reductionist would surely have to confront "the task of specifying a sense-datum language and showing how to translate the rest of significant discourse, statement by statement, into it." To illustrate the difficulty of doing so, Quine describes [[Rudolf Carnap]]'s attempt in his book ''Der logische Aufbau der Welt''.

Quine first observes that Carnap's starting point was not the strictest possible, as his "sense-datum language" included not only sense-events but also "the notations of logic, up through higher set theory... Empiricists there are who would boggle at such prodigality." Nonetheless, says Quine, Carnap showed great ingenuity in defining sensory concepts "which, but for his constructions, one would not have dreamed were definable on so slender a basis."  However, even such admirable efforts left Carnap, by his own admission, far short of completing the whole project.

Finally, Quine objects in principle to Carnap's proposed translation of statements like "quality q is at point-instant x;y;z;t" into his sense-datum language, because he does not define the connective "is at". Without statements of this kind, it is difficult to see, even in principle, how Carnap's project could have been completed.

The difficulty that Carnap encountered shows that reductionism is, at best, unproven and very difficult to prove. Until a reductionist can produce an acceptable proof, Quine maintains that reductionism is another "metaphysical article of faith".

==Quine's holism==
{{see also|Confirmation holism}}

Instead of reductionism, Quine proposes that it is the whole field of science and not single statements that are verified. All scientific statements are interconnected. Logical laws give the relation between different statements, while they also are statements of the system. This makes talk about the empirical content of a single statement misleading.  It also becomes impossible to draw a line between synthetic statements, which depend on experience, and analytic statements, that [[hold come what may]]. Any statement can be held as necessarily true according to Quine, if the right changes are made somewhere else in the system. In the same way, no statements are immune to revision.

Even logical laws can be revised according to Quine.  [[Quantum logic]], introduced by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]], abandons the [[law of distributivity]] from classical logic in order to reconcile some of the apparent inconsistencies of classical [[Boolean logic]] with the facts related to measurement and observation in quantum mechanics. Quine makes the case that the empirical study of physics has furnished apparently credible grounds for replacing classical logic by quantum logic, rather as  [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]] gave way to [[General relativity|Einsteinian physics]]. The idea that logical laws are not immune to revision in the light of [[empirical evidence]] has provoked an intense debate (see "[[Is Logic Empirical?]]").

According to Quine, there are two different results of his reasoning. The first is a blurring of the line between [[metaphysics]] and natural science. The common-sense theory about physical objects is [[Epistemology|epistemologically]] comparable to the gods of [[Homer]]. Quine is a [[physicalist]], in the sense that he considers it a scientific error not to adopt a theory which makes reference to physical objects. However, like Gods of Homer, physical objects are posits, and there is no great epistemic difference in kind; the difference is rather that the theory of physical objects has turned out to be a more efficient theory. As Quine states in "Two Dogmas", "The myth of physical objects is epistemologically superior to most in that it has proved more efficacious than other myths as a device for working a manageable structure into the flux of
experience".

The second result is a move towards [[pragmatism]]. Since, Quine says, the function of science is to predict future experiences in the light of past ones, the only ground for choosing which  explanations to believe is "the degree to which they expedite our dealings with [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]s." While pragmatic concerns are important for [[Carnap]] and other logical positivists when choosing a linguistic framework, their pragmatism "leaves off at the imagined boundary between the analytic and the synthetic". For Quine, every change in the system of science is, when [[rationality|rational]], pragmatic.

==Critique and influence==

[[Rudolf Carnap]] prepared a reply entitled "Quine on Analyticity", but this was not published until 1990.  Addressing Quine's concern over the status of the sentence "Everything green is extended", Carnap wrote "the difficulty here lies in the unclarity of the word 'green', namely in an indecision over whether one should use the word for something unextended, i.e., for a single space-time point. In daily life it is never so used, and one scarcely ever speaks of space-time points."  Carnap then puts forward that an exact artificial language ought to clarify the problem by defining 'green' (or its synonym) as something that is either necessarily or contingently not applied to space-time points.  He wrote that once that decision is made, the difficulty is resolved.  Carnap also answers Quine's argument on the use of sets of formal sentences to explain analyticity by arguing that this method is an explication of a poorly understood notion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quine, W. V. and Rudolf Carnap|title=Dear Carnap, Dear Van: The Quine-Carnap Correspondence and Related Work|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=427–432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Grice]] and [[P. F. Strawson]] criticized "Two Dogmas" in their (1956) article "In Defense of a Dogma". Among other things, they argue that Quine's [[skepticism]] about synonyms leads to a skepticism about meaning. If statements can have meanings, then it would make sense to ask "What does it mean?". If it makes sense to ask "What does it mean?", then synonymy can be defined as follows: Two sentences are synonymous if and only if the true answer of the question "What does it mean?" asked of one of them is the true answer to the same question asked of the other.  They also draw the conclusion that discussion about correct or incorrect translations would be impossible given Quine's argument. Four years after Grice and Strawson published their paper, Quine's book ''[[Word and Object]]'' was released. In the book Quine presented his theory of [[indeterminacy of translation]].

In "'Two Dogmas' revisited", [[Hilary Putnam]] argues that Quine is attacking two different notions. Analytic truth defined as a true statement derivable from a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] by putting synonyms for synonyms is near [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] account of analytic truth as a truth whose negation is a contradiction. Analytic truth defined as a truth confirmed no matter what however, is closer to one of the traditional accounts of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. While the first four sections of Quine's paper concern analyticity, the last two concern apriority. Putnam considers the argument in the two last sections as independent of the first four, and at the same time as Putnam criticizes Quine, he also emphasizes his historical importance as the first top rank philosopher to both reject the notion of apriority and sketch a methodology without it.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary, "'Two dogmas' revisited." In Gilbert Ryle, ''Contemporary Aspects of Philosophy.'' Stocksfield: Oriel Press, 1976, 202–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerrold Katz]], a onetime associate of [[Noam Chomsky]]'s, countered the arguments of "Two Dogmas" directly by trying to define analyticity non-circularly on the syntactical features of sentences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/20114738 Linsky, J. ''Analytical/Synthetic and Semantic Theory'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2023770 Quine, W. v. O.: ''On a Suggestion of Katz'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psiquadrat.de/downloads/katz74.pdf Katz, J: ''Where Things Stand Now with the Analytical/Synthetic Distinction'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 1 : The Dawn of Analysis'' [[Scott Soames]] (pp 360–361) has pointed out that Quine's circularity argument needs two of the logical positivists' central theses to be effective:

:All [[Logical truth|necessary truths]] (and all ''a priori'' truths) are analytic

:Analyticity is needed to explain and legitimate necessity.

It is only when these two theses are accepted that Quine's argument holds. It is not a problem that the notion of necessity is presupposed by the notion of analyticity if necessity can be explained without analyticity. According to Soames, both theses were accepted by most philosophers when Quine published "Two Dogmas". Today however, Soames holds both statements to be antiquated.

[[Admiral]] '''Sir William Garnham Luard''' [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] (7 April 1820 – 19 May 1910) was a leading British naval figure during the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;The Illustrated Naval and Military Magazine, Volume V, W.H. Allen &amp; co, 1886&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naval career==
Born in 1820, he was the eldest son of a local magistrate, William Wright Luard J.P., D.L. of Witham Lodge,&lt;ref&gt;see Men of Bad Character: the Witham Fires of the 1820s by Janet Gyford&lt;/ref&gt; [[Witham]], Essex (formerly of [[Hatfield Peverel Priory]]) and Anne Garnham, only child of Thomas Garnham of Felsham Hall, Suffolk.&lt;ref name=burke&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ni4BAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA909&amp;lpg=PA909&amp;dq=%22William+Luard%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n4q6VCywCN&amp;sig=CbI5y7amBhIxcAcQr9-FElPLW1I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5Sn8S8-8KpvMNJmugYkC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22William%20Luard%22&amp;f=false A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain, Volume 2 By Sir Bernard Burke, p. 909]&lt;/ref&gt; The Luards were a prominent family of Protestant [[Huguenot]] merchants who had fled to England in the late 17th century as part of the mass exodus of Huguenots from France to England that followed the [[Edict of Fontainebleau|1685 revocation]] of the [[Edict of Nantes]].&lt;ref name=burke/&gt;

Luard entered the Royal Naval College (formerly the [[Royal Naval Academy]]) at [[Portsmouth]] at the age of 13 and later studied at Portsmouth Naval College. He served extensively and saw action in the South China Sea, for which he was recognized in dispatches and decorated for gallantry and bravery several times including being named Companion of the [[Order of the Bath]] (CB).&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101034617 Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

After a distinguished career as a naval officer, including as captain and commander of {{HMS|Formidable|1825|6}} and [[HMS Waterloo (1833)|HMS ''Conqueror'']], he served as superintendent of the [[Sheerness Dockyard]] and the [[Malta Dockyard]]. From 1882 to 1885, he was [[President]] of the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

He was awarded the Burmese War Medal for dispersing the pirates of Chin-a-poo and received the Medal of the Legion of Honour, 4th Class, from Emperor [[Napoleon III]]. He was promoted [[Rear-Admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear-Admiral]] in 1875, [[Vice-Admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] on 15 June 1879,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24734|page=3967|date=17 June 1879}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] in 1885.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; 
 
Luard was advanced to [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1897, during her diamond jubilee year.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Luard married Charlotte Du Cane (an anglicization of the original French surname 'Du Quesne') in 1858. She was from another French Huguenot family (see [[Jean Du Quesne, the elder]] and descendants), with landed estates at [[Braxted Park]] and [[Coggeshall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldroots.com/brigitte/famous/j/jeanduquesnedesc.htm Worldroots.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060314173004/http://worldroots.com/brigitte/famous/j/jeanduquesnedesc.htm |date=14 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The English 'Du Quesnes' were from a branch of the family of the famous French [[Admiral]] [[Abraham Duquesne]], Marquis du Bouchet — see [[Jean Du Quesne, the elder]]&lt;/ref&gt; Admiral and Lady Luard had 11 children.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

A staunch [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and supporter of Prime Minister [[William Gladstone]], Luard retired to his estate in Essex&lt;ref&gt;The Lodge, Witham, Essex&lt;/ref&gt; where he served as a [[Justice of the Peace]] and as an active member of the court of Quarter Sessions. He died in 1910 as a result of injuries sustained in a carriage accident.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;
