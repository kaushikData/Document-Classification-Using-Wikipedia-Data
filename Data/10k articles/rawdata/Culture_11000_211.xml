[[File:Klee, paul, angelus novus, 1920.jpg|''Angelus Novus''|thumb|right|240px]]

'''''Angelus Novus''''' (New Angel) is a 1920 [[monoprint]] by the Swiss-German artist [[Paul Klee]], using the oil transfer method he invented. It is now in the collection of the [[Israel Museum]] in [[Jerusalem]].

In the ninth thesis of his 1940 essay “[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]”, the German critic and philosopher [[Walter Benjamin]], who purchased the print in 1921, interprets it this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Klee painting named ''Angelus Novus'' shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, "[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]", Illuminations, trans. Harry Zohn, New York: Schocken Books, 1969: 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Otto Karl Werckmeister notes that Benjamin's reading of Klee's New Angel image has led to it becoming "an icon of the [[political left|left]]."&lt;ref&gt;Werkmeister, ''Icons of the Left: Benjamin and Einstein, Picasso and Kafka After the Fall.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997: 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name and concept of the angel has inspired works by other artists, filmmakers, writers and musicians, including [[John Akomfrah]], [[Ariella Azoulay]], [[Carolyn Forché]], and [[Rabih Alameddine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lux.org.uk/collection/works/last-angel-history|title= ''Last Angel of History''|year=2013|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zingmagazine.com/zing6/reviews/angelus.html|title= zing6 - reviews - angelus nova|publisher=''Zing Magazine''|year=1997|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/sandh/2000/june00/munchener.htm|title= Seventh Munchener Biennale|date=4–19 May 2000|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1940 Walter Benjamin committed suicide during an attempt to flee the Nazi regime. After World War II Walter Benjamin’s lifelong friend, [[Gershom Scholem]] (1897–1982), the distinguished scholar of Jewish mysticism, inherited the drawing. According to Scholem, Benjamin felt a mystical identification with the ''Angelus Novus'' and incorporated it in his theory of the “angel of history,” a melancholy view of historical process as an unceasing cycle of despair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imj.org.il/imagine/collections/item.asp?itemNum=199799 Angelus Novus] at the [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, in conjunction with her solo exhibition at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, American artist [[R. H. Quaytman]] discovered that the monoprint had been adhered to an 1838 copper-plate engraving by Friedrich Muller after a [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]] portrait of [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cotter|first1=Holland|title=R.H.

'''Antioch University''' is a [[private university|private]] [[non-profit]] [[university system]] in the United States with five campuses located in four states, as well as an online campus and the Graduate School of Leadership and Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antioch.edu/gslc/|title=Antioch University Graduate School of Leadership and Change|website=www.antioch.edu/gslc|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; All campuses of the university are regionally accredited by the [[Higher Learning Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antioch.edu/our-accreditation/ Antioch University - Our Accreditation]&lt;/ref&gt; Campuses are located in [[Los Angeles, California]]; [[Santa Barbara, California]]; [[Keene, New Hampshire]]; [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]]; and [[Seattle, Washington]]. Antioch University uses the system of [[narrative evaluation]] as a substitute to the conventional grading system of A-F letter grades. Additionally, Antioch University houses two institution-wide programs, the PhD in Leadership and Change&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.antioch.edu/gslc/degrees-programs/business-management-leadership/phd-leadership-change/|title=PhD in Leadership &amp; Change {{!}} Antioch University {{!}} Graduate School of Leadership and Change|website=www.antioch.edu/gslc|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Antioch Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antioch.edu/auonline/|title=Antioch University Online {{!}} A University in Pursuit of a Better World|website=www.antioch.edu/auonline|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While it originated from the historic college, Antioch University should not be confused with [[Antioch College]] in Yellow Springs, Ohio, which gained its independence from the University in 2009, and has since had no affiliation with the University.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/07/01/antioch Jaschik, Scott (July 1, 2009) "A Deal to Revive Antioch" Inside Higher Ed]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Antioch University serves more than 4,000 adult students around the world and across the country, online and from its five campuses in four states. The [[Los Angeles]] campus offers an MFA in creative writing; the [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] campus offers an MA in education with an emphasis in social justice; the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] campus offers a program in conflict analysis; the [[Seattle]] campus offers integrative drama and art therapy programs; and the online campus offers a BA in Human Services Administration as well as a BA in [[Bachelor of Liberal Studies|Liberal Studies]] with various concentrations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Background==
Antioch University grew out of Antioch College.  Antioch College was founded in 1852 as the result of American educator [[Horace Mann]]'s dream to establish a college comparable to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] but with some notable differences. Antioch College was to be completely nonsectarian and [[co-educational]], and with a curriculum that would include the traditional treatment of the classics, but would emphasize science and the scientific method, history, and modern literature. Students would not compete for grades but would be encouraged to pursue issues of interest to them, read what they considered worthwhile and present papers on topics of their own choosing. Horace Mann became the first president in 1853.

Antioch College began a period of rapid expansion in 1964 with the acquisition of the Putney School of Education in Vermont.  That campus has evolved and moved several times to become Antioch University New England now situated in Keene, NH. By 1972, another 23 centers had been opened, and the College By-Laws were revised to define Antioch as a "network", not a college. Even as centers began to close, new centers continued to open; 38 centers would be opened by the end of 1979, including the ABA-accredited Antioch School of Law located in Washington, D.C. In 1977, the Antioch College Board of Trustees voted to change its name to Antioch University, and in 1978, Antioch University Corporation replaced Antioch College Corporation as owner of all institutional assets, tangible and intangible.

In 1986, the University decided to close 32 of its units around the country, including the School of Law. The law school now operates as the University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law. By 1989, the University consolidated to 6 campuses including 1) its original campus, Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio; 2) Antioch University New England in Keene New Hampshire; 3) Antioch University Los Angeles; 4) Antioch University Santa Barbara; 5) Antioch University Seattle; and 6) Antioch University McGregor, an adult, graduate degree program in Yellow Springs, Ohio, now known as Antioch University Midwest.

In 2008, citing financial exigency, Antioch University closed the Antioch College campus in Yellow Springs.  Antioch College alumni came together to found the Antioch College Continuation Corporation and purchased the College name and campus back from the University. The newly independent Antioch College reopened in 2011 and purchased its remaining assets back from the University in 2012.  Since then, Antioch University and Antioch College have operated as wholly separate, non-affiliated institutions, although the University continues to retain the transcripts of all College alumni who entered prior to the 2008 closure.

From its inception, racial and gender equality, independent study and independent thinking were integral parts of Antioch College. Six students were accepted for the first quarter: four men and two women who came to share the same college classrooms for the first time in the U.S. The notion of [[gender equality]] extended also to the faculty. Antioch College was the first U.S. college to designate a woman as full professor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/02/nation/na-hometown-antioch2|title=Antioch College alumni plan to save their school|author=P.J. Huffstutter | work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the original faculty included seven men and two women. Then, in 1863, the college instituted the policy that no applicant was to be rejected on the basis of race.

In the early 1850s, [[Rebecca Pennell]] offered a course on teaching methods which was the first of its kind, while [[John Burns Weston]], class of 1857, established a long-standing precedent by being both student and faculty simultaneously. He taught Greek language and literature for 20 years and remained a lifelong student.

While Antioch College never diverged from the philosophy of Horace Mann, the final form of an Antioch education traced its roots from the election of [[Arthur Ernest Morgan|Arthur Morgan]] as President of the college in 1920. Morgan, like Mann, believed in the development of the individual as a whole. Having seen the difficulty encountered by [[ivory-tower]] academicians attempting to participate in the business world, he resolved to change the cloistered educational experience by providing students with work experience in their field. He wrote “The Plan for the New Antioch” which was his vision for the future of the school. This was the beginning of Antioch's unique program of work and study, what Morgan termed, “industrial education.”

Morgan initiated the practice of [[student government]]. He also changed the nature of the admissions procedure. Rather than relying on [[entrance examination]]s, Morgan opted for more personal information on prospective students. In addition, senior exams were graded "honors" or "pass", and students who failed could retake the exam. Morgan remained at Antioch until 1933, when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] requested that he assume directorship of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] Project.

==College expansion and university founding==
In 1964, Antioch College took over the Putney School of Education in [[Vermont]] (now [[Antioch University New England]] in Keene, New Hampshire). During the next decade, other adult learning programs were instituted: among them, Antioch Seattle; Antioch Southern California with campuses in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara; and the Antioch Education Abroad Program (with centers in [[London]], Germany and other locations).

In 1978, Antioch College became a university system. From 1978 to 1994 the President of Antioch College also served as the Chancellor of Antioch University.&lt;ref&gt;http://antiochiana.edu/PresidentsList.htm{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, Antioch University's Ph.D. in Leadership and Change Program was founded. The program is designed to educate professionals from a wide range of fields to understand and lead organizational change. The program's low-residency model offers students interdisciplinary study with a practitioner focus that teaches and encourages applied research.

In 2009 Antioch College became entirely independent of Antioch University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ysnews.com/news/2009/09/antioch-college-alive-and-independent-again|title=Antioch College alive and independent again|author=Diane Chiddister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==

===Antioch University New England===
Founded in 1964, [[Antioch University New England]] is located in Keene, New Hampshire, a small city with a strong tradition of civic, cultural, and environmental activism, in the heart of the state's [[Monadnock Region]]. It is Antioch University's largest branch, with over 1,200 graduate-level students.  Master's degrees are awarded in areas of [[Mental Health Counselor|Clinical Mental Health Counseling]] (with specializations in Addictions Counseling &amp; Dance/Movement Therapy), [[Family Therapy|Marriage and Family Therapy]], [[Environmental Studies]], Organization &amp; Management ("Green MBA"), and Education.  Doctoral degrees are awarded in the areas of [[Clinical Psychology]] ([[Psy.D]]), Marriage and Family Therapy (Ph. D), and Environmental Studies (Ph. D).  Antioch-New England is one of only three schools in the United States to offer [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] teacher training and has gained critical acclaim for its annually published environmental literary journal ''[[Whole Terrain]]''.

===Antioch University Los Angeles===
{{advert|date=August 2018}}
Established in 1972 and with more than 8,000 alumni, [[Antioch University Los Angeles]] serves the diverse communities of the greater [[Los Angeles]] area. The core values of [[social justice]], service to community, and [[lifelong learning]] comprise the heart of the BA degree completion program and master's degree programs in organizational management, education and teacher credentialing, psychology, and creative writing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.antioch.edu/los-angeles&lt;/ref&gt; Partnerships with community organizations provide students with unique experiential learning opportunities. The low-residency MFA in creative writing was named among the top five programs in the nation by ''[[The Atlantic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/08/the-best-of-the-best/6049/&lt;/ref&gt; and the graduate clinical psychology specialization in [[LGBT]] studies is the first of its kind.  The MA in [[urban sustainability]] was developed in response to the growing awareness of the interconnections among environmental, economic, and social issues. The interdisciplinary program prepares well-trained, well-informed scholars, community leaders, and activists to advocate for sustainable urban policy and social change in the face of the growing global environmental crisis. The current student body consists of approximately 1000 learners, and supports a collection of faculty who are arguably in the top echelon of their fields. The school also offers a B.A. in Liberal Studies as well as Masters of Arts in Psychology, Organizational Management, and Urban Sustainability.

===Antioch University Midwest===
Founded in 1988, [[Antioch University Midwest]] (AUM) is located in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Antioch University Midwest offers bachelor's degrees in Humanities, Management, Human Development, Liberal Arts, Health and Wellness, and Human Service Administration through an academically intensive cohort model of on-campus classes offered in the evenings and on Saturdays. They also offer two online Certificates in Education, as well as an MBA with concentrations in healthcare leadership and change management. The MA in Individualized Liberal and Professional Studies provides a self-designed major where students work with Antioch University faculty as well as specialized academic professionals who agree to mentor the student through their studies. Many of the graduate programs are available with limited residency in an online format. Antioch University Midwest was previously known as Antioch University McGregor and was founded in 1988 as the School of Adult and Experiential Learning at Antioch College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/dayton-news/antioch-university-mcgregor-changes-its-name-759064.html|title=Antioch University McGregor changes its name}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Antioch University Midwest]] (name changed June 12, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antioch University Santa Barbara===
Founded in 1977, [[Antioch University Santa Barbara]] enrolls approximately 270 adult students from Santa Barbara and surrounding counties, as well as assorted students from other regions of the United States and some foreign countries. The campus offers a BA in liberal studies with seven possible concentrations, MA in clinical psychology with two possible concentrations, a [[PsyD]] in clinical psychology, an MA in education and teaching credential program, and an MBA program, and a Women and Leadership Certificate program.

===Antioch University Seattle===
[[Antioch University Seattle]] (AUS), founded in 1975 in [[Seattle, Washington]], offers master's degrees, a BA completion program, and a Doctor of Clinical Psychology (PsyD). Between 800 and 1000 students attend AUS, with an average age of 35.

==Antioch College separation and reorganization==
In June 2007, the Antioch University Board of Trustees announced that they would suspend operations of [[Antioch College]] the following year and that they intended to re-open the college in four years. It was their belief that four years would give the university the necessary time to develop and execute a plan for re-building Antioch College in a manner that would both honor its legacy and secure its future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/antioch/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618232943/http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/antioch/ |archive-date=2010-06-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was considerable controversy among members of the Antioch College alumni group and the administration, suggesting that the university should not close the college. During this time – 2007-2009 – two different organizations (the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] [NCA] and the [[American Association of University Professors]] [AAUP]) conducted audits and investigations into the university's actions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/Antioch.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916125129/http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/Antioch.htm |archive-date=2009-09-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a response from the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.antioch.edu/AAUP.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917070006/http://antioch.edu/AAUP.html |archive-date=2010-09-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, a group of Antioch College alumni, headed by the Antioch College Alumni Board, expressed interest in purchasing the college from the university and re-opening the college as an independent institution. The alumni group formed the Antioch College Continuation Corporation as the vehicle for negotiating and owning the college. After two years of negotiations, the parties agreed to terms and, on September 4, 2009, the parties conducted a signing ceremony that ratified their agreement. [[Mark Roosevelt]], a well-known senior education administrator, previously the superintendent of [[Pittsburgh Public Schools]], was appointed President. A reopened and separate Antioch College welcomed its first class of students in the fall of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/dayton-news/reopening-antioch-college-would-set-historic-precedent-1074650.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ariana Nozeman''' (alt: A(d)riana Noseman/Nooseman): born Ariana van den Bergh (1626/1628 in [[Middelburg]] – December 7, 1661 in [[Amsterdam]]), was the first [[actress]] in [[The Netherlands]]. She made her debut on stage in 1655 at the [[Schouwberg of Van Kampen|Amsterdam Schouwburg (Amsterdam Theater)]] in a play by [[Jan Jacobsz. Schipper]] which accidentally bore her name ‘Onvergelijkelijke Ariana’ (‘Incomparable Ariana’).

==Early life==
The daughter of actor and playwright Adriaan van den Bergh, Ariana was born in Middelburg  probably between 1626 and 1628. Her father had a travelling theatre company and translated and adapted several English dramas for the Dutch stage. Among them Thomas Kyd's “the Spanish Tragedy”-renamed Don Jeronimo (1621) in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Ariana could possibly not write.

She may have learnt the craft at a very early age. It was quite common for women and children in travelling theatre companies to appear on stage as these groups often consisted of actors’ families. Later on, she possibly joined the troupe of Jan Baptist van Fornenbergh. This company took the tradition of Dutch theatre to distant corners of Europe touring the north of [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]], performing at fairs as well as royal courts such as the one of  Swedish [[Christina of Sweden|Queen Christina]] (1653). While in [[Hamburg]],  the actress married her colleague, the actor Gillis Nozeman in the Reformed Church of nearby [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], a free haven for dissenters and marginalized. Ariana and Gillis became known as the first actors’couple in Dutch theatre history.

==Professional life==
On June 30, 1655, the name of Ariana Nozeman was recorded for the first time in the Amsterdam theatre archives. The actress was paid 76,50 Dutch florins for 17 performances, which was higher than most of her male counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Ariana was even paid more than her husband because she brought her own opulent costumes to the scene. Unlike Italy and France where women had already made their appearances on the public stage, women’s parts in the Dutch Republic were still generally being played by men in the first half of the 17th century. The resignation of six actors at the Amsterdam Schouwburg (Theatre) may have led to Ariana Nozeman’s debut.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Ariana Nozeman mostly played serious roles. She was the first actress who ever performed [[Badeloch]] in the historical play ''[[Gijsbrecht van Aemstel (play)|Gijsbrecht van Aemstel]]'' by [[Joost van den Vondel]], one of Holland’s most famous poets of the 17th century. Ariana was rarely seen in farces or comical acts and she also sang. She is credited as the first ballet dancer in The Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} She was often seen on stage together with her husband Gillis Nozeman either as a couple or as antagonists. Their daughter Maria Nozeman (born 1652) followed in her mother’s footsteps; she entered the stage at the age of six years. The Nozemans supplemented their theatre incomes by running an inn called The Camel on one of the Amsterdam canals.

==Calvinist opposition==
By putting herself on public show, Ariana Nozeman would surely not have had the approval of the stern [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. [[Simon Schama]] in ''[[The Embarrassment of Riches: An Interpretation of Dutch Culture in the Golden Age|The Embarrassment of Riches]]'' says: “In 1655 the first actress appeared in the Amsterdam theater, strengthening the clergy’s view that it was the sink of the vilest iniquity. But Adriana Nozeman went on to make an illustrious career there nonetheless”. Holland, in spite of its [[Calvinist]] character, was a secular society and Amsterdam, the capital of the mighty [[Dutch Republic]], known for its free and tolerant climate. Banned philosophers such as [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Descartes]] got their works published here. [[Pornography]] was printed here as well.

The stage curtain dropped for Ariana Nozeman when she was not even 35 years old. She died on December 7, 1661. Three months earlier, she had lost her only 7-year-old son Mathijs. Maybe she died of heartbreak or maybe she fell victim to the plague. She was buried in the Oude Kerk (Old Church), now in the heart of Amsterdam’s famous red light district. Her death meant a great loss for the Amsterdam Schouwburg. They contracted immediately four new actresses to replace her.

Three hundred years after her stage debut, in 1955, the first woman on the Dutch stage was commemorated. The city council of Amsterdam honoured her memory with a street named Ariana Nozemanstraat in the western part of the city.

'''Bisque''' is a smooth, creamy, highly seasoned [[soup]] of [[France|French]] origin, classically based on a strained broth ([[coulis]]) of [[crustacean]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The Academie Française Dictionary defines a bisque as: BISQUE n. Potage fait d'un coulis de crustacés. Une bisque de homard, d'écrevisses. (Soup made from a crustacean coulis, e.g. lobster or crawfish bisque.)&lt;/ref&gt; It can be made from [[lobster]], [[langoustine]], [[crab]], [[shrimp]], or [[crayfish]].

== Etymology ==

It is thought the name is derived from ''Biscay'', as in [[Bay of Biscay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bisque |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the crustaceans are certainly ''bis cuites'' "twice cooked" (by analogy to a [[biscuit]]) for they are first [[Sautéing|sautéed]] lightly in their shells, then simmered in wine and aromatic ingredients, before being strained, followed by the addition of cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=www.askoxford.com |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/biscuit?view=uk |title=biscuit |publisher=AskOxford |accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

Bisque is a method of extracting flavor from imperfect crustaceans not good enough to send to market. In an authentic bisque, the shells are ground to a fine paste and added to thicken the soup. [[Julia Child]] even remarked, "Do not wash anything off until the soup is done because you will be using the same utensils repeatedly and you don't want any marvelous tidbits of flavor losing themselves down the drain."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | last = Child | first = Julia | authorlink = Julia Child |author2=Simone Beck | title = Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume 2 | publisher = Knopf | year = 1970 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-394-40152-2  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Bisques are thickened with rice, which can either be strained out, leaving behind the [[starch]], or pureed during the final stages.

Seafood bisque is traditionally served in a low two-handled cup on a saucer or in a mug.

Bisque is also commonly used to refer to cream-based soups that do not contain seafood, in which the sometimes pre-cooked ingredients are pureed or processed in a [[food processor]] or a [[food mill]]. Common varieties include [[squash (fruit)|squash]], [[tomato]], [[Edible mushroom|mushroom]], and [[Capsicum|red pepper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitzewich|first1=John|authorlink = John Mitzewich |title=Tomato Bisque – Soup Might Not Count as a Meal, but Bisque Certainly Does|url=http://foodwishes.blogspot.jp/2013/10/tomato-bisque-soup-might-not-count-as.html|website=Food Wishes|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor '''Bronisław Geremek''' {{IPAc-pl|AUD|Pl-Bronisław Geremek.ogg|b|r|o|'|ń|i|s|ł|a|f|-|g|e|'|r|e|m|e|k}} (born '''Benjamin Lewertow''';&lt;ref name=JerryLewart&gt;[http://www.znak.org.pl/index.php?t=ludzie&amp;id=233 "Mój polski brat (My Polish Brother)", interview with Jerry Lewart, by Waldemar Piasecki,]&lt;/ref&gt; 6 March 1932 – 13 July 2008) was a Polish [[Social history|social historian]] and politician.

== Early life and education ==
Geremek was born in [[Warsaw]] on 6 March 1932.  His father Boruch Lewertow, a fur merchant,&lt;ref name=JerryLewart /&gt; was murdered in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geremek.pl/index.php?navi=006&amp;id=44 Bronisław Geremek : Wystąpienia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803024425/http://www.geremek.pl/index.php?navi=006&amp;id=44 |date=August 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Sharca, and he were smuggled out of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] in 1943 and were sheltered by Stefan Geremek. Geremek later married Bronisław's mother and Bronisław was further raised in a Roman Catholic tradition.&lt;ref name=JerryLewart /&gt; In his adult life he considered himself neither a Jew nor a Catholic. His grandfather was a [[maggid]], his brother Jerry, living in New York is a Jew and his sons living in Poland are Roman Catholics.&lt;ref name=JerryLewart /&gt;

In 1954 Bronisław Geremek graduated from the Faculty of History at the [[Warsaw University]], and in 1956–1958 he completed postgraduate studies at the [[École pratique des hautes études]] in Paris. He completed his PhD in 1960 and in 1972 he was granted a postdoctoral degree at the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (PAN). In 1989 he was appointed associate professor.

The chief domain of Geremek's scholarly work was research on the history of culture and medieval society. His scholarly achievements included numerous articles and lectures, as well as ten books, which have been translated into ten languages. His doctoral thesis (1960) concerned the labour market in medieval Paris, including prostitution. His postdoctoral thesis (1972) concerned underworld groups in medieval Paris.

Almost the whole of Geremek's scholarly career was connected with the Institute of History of the Polish Academy of Sciences, where he worked from 1955 to 1985. However, from 1960 to 1965 he was a lecturer at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris and the manager of the Polish Culture Centre of that university. Geremek was given honorary degrees by the [[University of Bologna]], [[Utrecht University]], the Sorbonne, [[Columbia University]] and [[Jagiellonian University]] in Kraków. In 1992 he was designated visiting professor at the [[Collège de France]]. He was a member of Academia Europea,  the [[PEN Club]], the Société Européenne de Culture, fellow of [[Collegium Invisibile]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.edu.pl/index.php?id=tutorzy&amp;kat=Czlonkowie |title=List of Fellows |publisher=ci.edu.pl |accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous other societies and associations.

He was a longtime professor and Chairholder of the Chair of European Civilisation at the [[College of Europe]] until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coleurop.be/w/Bronislaw.Geremek Chair of European Civilisation at [[College of Europe]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political activity ==

=== History of Poland (1945–1989) ===
In 1950 Geremek joined the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR). He was the second secretary of the Basic Party Organisation (POP) of the PZPR at Warsaw University. In 1968, however, he withdrew from the party in protest against the [[Warsaw Pact]]'s invasion of Czechoslovakia.

In the 1970s Geremek was considered one of the leading figures in the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|Polish democratic opposition]]. In 1978 he co-founded the Society for Educational Courses, for which he gave lectures. While on a Fellowship at the Wilson Center in Washington DC, he met General [[Edward Rowny]] who introduced him to [[Lane Kirkland]] and [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael|first=Szporer|title=Solidarity; The Great Workers Strike|year=2012|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739174876|pages=250–251}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1980 he joined the Gdańsk workers' protest movement and became one of the advisers of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarność]] (Polish for "Solidarity") – NSZZ. In 1981 he chaired the Program Commission of the First National Convention of Solidarity. After martial law was declared in December 1981 he was interned until December 1982, when he once again became an adviser to the then-illegal Solidarity, working closely  with [[Lech Wałęsa]]. In 1983 he was arrested by the Polish authorities.

=== History of Poland (1989–2008) ===

==== Polish Round Table Agreement ====
Between 1987 and 1989 Geremek was the leader of the Commission for Political Reforms of the Civic Committee, which prepared proposals for [[History of Poland (1989–present)|peaceful democratic transformation]] in Poland. In 1989 he played a crucial role during the debates between [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Solidarity and the authorities]] that led to free parliamentary elections and the establishment of the ‘Contract Sejm’.

==== Third Polish Republic ====
Geremek then became one of the founders of [[Democratic Union (Poland)|The Democratic Union]] (later merged into [[Freedom Union (Poland)|The Freedom Union]]) and was the leader of the Democratic Union's parliamentary group from 1990 to 1997. After the elections in 1991 President Lech Wałęsa asked him to form a new government, but Geremek failed to do so and Jan Olszewski was appointed Prime Minister instead.

From 1989 to 2001 Geremek was a member of the lower house of the Polish parliament, the [[Sejm]], and chairman of the Political Council of the Freedom Union. He chaired the Sejm's Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1989 to 1997, its Constitutional Committee from 1989 to 1991 and its European Law Committee from 2000 to 2001.

After a coalition government was formed in October 1997 by the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) and the Freedom Union Geremek served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek until 2000. In 1998 Poland chaired [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], and Bronisław Geremek served as Chairperson-in-Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osce.org/chairmanship/former-chairpersons-in-office|title=Former OSCE Chairpersons-in-Office {{!}} OSCE|website=www.osce.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1999 he signed the treaty under which Poland joined NATO.

=== European Parliament Deputy ===
[[File:2004.05.09. Bronislaw Geremek 02.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronisław Geremek in 2004]]
In the election to the European Parliament in June  2004 Geremek was elected as a candidate of the Freedom Union, winning the largest number of votes in Warsaw. In the European Parliament he was a member of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]].

Prof Geremek was a great believer in the idea of Europe, though he felt that there is a need to create a clear European identity and the need for people to believe in the benefits that Europe can bring to them- not just as nations, but also as individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Conversation with Prof Geremek with Ilmas Futehally of Strategic Foresight Group {{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/geremek-futureofeurope.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010171819/http://strategicforesight.com/geremek-futureofeurope.htm |archivedate=October 10, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007 Geremek refused to declare that he had never collaborated with the Communist secret service, which he was being asked to do under a new [[Lustration in Poland|vetting law]]. In May 2007 the [[Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland]]) rejected most of the new vetting law, including the clause that would have made it mandatory for nearly 700,000 Poles to sign declarations certifying that they had never collaborated with the secret services under the old regime.

From 2006 to 2008, he was president of the [[Jean Monnet Foundation for Europe]].

Geremek was a supporter of the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/overview/?mapcountry=allhea&amp;mapgroup=hea|title=Supporters|last=|first=|date=|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=2017-09-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cathedral of Cefalù''' ({{lang-it|Duomo di Cefalù}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Basilica#Ecclesiastical_basilicas|basilica]] in [[Cefalù]], [[Sicily]]. It is one of nine structures included in the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] known as [[Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefalù and Monreale]].

The [[cathedral]] was erected in 1131 in the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] architectural style, the island of Sicily having been [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|conquered by the Normans]] in 1091. According to tradition, the building was erected after a vow made to the Holy Saviour by the King of Sicily, [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]], after he escaped from a storm to land on the city's beach. The building has a fortress-like character and, seen from a distance, it dominates the skyline of the surrounding medieval town. It made a powerful statement of the Norman presence.

==History==
[[File:Cefalù dal monte.JPG|thumb|280px|Cefalù Cathedral within the town]]
The cathedral was built in a long-populated area, as attested by the presence of a Roman road and a Paleo-Christian mosaic. Construction began in 1131, the apse [[mosaic]]s were begun in 1145, and the sarcophagi that Roger II provided for his tomb and that of his wife were put in place the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Demus|first1=Otto|title=The Mosiacs of Norman Sicily|publisher=Hackert Art Books|isbn=978-0878173105|pages=3-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1172 the church suffered a period of decline. In 1215 [[Frederick II of Hohenstaufen]] moved the two sarcophagi to the [[Cathedral of Palermo]].  Construction of the cathedral was resumed soon after, the façade being completed in 1240. The Cathedral was consecrated in 1267 by [[Rodolphe de Chevriêres]], [[Bishop of Albano]].

In 1472 a [[portico]], by Ambrogio da [[Como]], was added between the two towers of the facade.

==Description==

===Architecture===
[[File:Cefalù Duomo.jpg|thumb|Lateral view]]
The cathedral is preceded by a large terraced [[parvis]], which was originally a cemetery. According to tradition, it was created with earth brought from [[Jerusalem]], which was believed to have qualities that caused the rapid [[mummy|mummification]] of corpses.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The façade is characterized by two large Norman towers with [[mullion]]ed windows, each surmounted by a small spire added in the 15th century. Each spire is different: one has a square plan surrounded by flame-shaped [[merlon]]s, the latter symbolizing the Papal authority and the [[mitre]]; the other has an octagonal plan and Ghibelline merlons, symbolizing the Royal and temporal power.

The 15th-century portico has three arches, the two outer being pointed, supported by four columns and vaulting ribs. Under the portico is the ''Porta Regum'' (Kings' Door), with a finely decorated marble portal flanked by wall paintings.

The interior of the cathedral is on the Latin cross plan, divided into a nave and two aisles by arcades of antique columns: fourteen in pink granite and two in [[cipolin]]. The bases and capitals are from the 2nd century AD. Two large capitals supporting the [[triumphal arch]] of the nave were probably made by an [[Apulia|Apulian]] workshop in the mid-12th century.
[[File:Cefalu Cathedral interior BW 2012-10-11 12-07-53.jpg|thumb|Interior view towards the chancel]]
The roof of the nave was lowered, as can be seen from the exterior of the building. The [[transept]] is higher than both the nave and aisles. While parts of the building are barrel-vaulted and parts have an open timber roof, the [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]] has a ribbed vault of stone.

Beyond the crossing, the church is unusual in combining a style that is essentially Romanesque in its massive simple forms with the pointed (or ogival) arch. This feature is also seen in [[Monreale Cathedral]]. It is a forerunner of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style which was to develop in the region of [[Paris]] within a few years.

The church has three [[apse]]s, an arrangement also seen in Sicily at Monreale Cathedral. The two lower side apses have the upper tiers of the exterior decorated by blind arcading of small crossed arches and sculpted [[corbel]]s, also seen used extensively at Monreale. The corbels date from 1215-1223 and portray masks, heads of animals, and human figures in contorted positions. The corbels of the central apse are more recent. The central apse originally had three large ocular windows,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Rose window]]&lt;/ref&gt; which were later closed to give space for the mosaic, and a larger central window of ogival shape. Two other pairs of circular windows are located at the transept's ends.

====Cloister====
The cathedral has a cloister that can be entered from within the church. The arcade has pointed arches, each of which rests on slender, paired columns. The form is not different from that of Spanish and some French cloisters; the composite capitals of the coupled columns are Norman and other more generically Romanesque in their motifs. This cloister is the model for the successive Norman cloisters of Sicily, in particular that of the [[Monreale]].

===Artwork===

====Presbyterium mosaic====
[[File:Duomo cefalu msu2017-0740.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Pantokrator]].]]
[[File:Mosaico della Cattedrale di Cefalù.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Virgin Mary]] with four [[archangels]].]]
It was probably planned that the entire church be decorated in [[mosaic]], but this was completed only in the [[presbyterium]] area. Mosaic still covers the apse and about half of the side walls. Roger II brought masters in the technique of mosaic from [[Constantinople]]. They adapted their traditional Byzantine decorative art to an architectural structure that was of northern European origin.

The dominant figure of the decorative scheme is the bust of [[Christ Pantokrator]], portrayed on the [[semi-dome]] of the [[apse]] with a hand raised in [[Benediction]]. In his left hand he carries the [[Gospel of John]], in which can be read, in Greek and Latin: "I am the light of the world, who follows me will not wander in the darkness but will have the light of life" ([[Gospel of John|John]], {{bibleverse-nb||John|8:12|KJV}}).

In the upper tier of the apsidal wall is depicted the Blessed Virgin Mary, her hands raised in prophecy, flanked by four [[archangel]]s. In the second and third tiers, on either side of the central window, are figures of [[Twelve apostles|apostles]] and [[Four Evangelists|evangelists]], placed according to a planned theological programme.

The mosaic decoration extends into the presbyterium, with the side walls showing figures of prophets and saints. On the right wall, adjacent to the royal throne, are royal figures, while on the left side, adjacent the bishop's throne, are priestly figures. Each figure is accompanied by an inscription, in Greek or Latin, describing the character portrayed. The decoration of the cross-vaulted ceiling depicts four [[cherubim]] and four [[seraphim]].

The chief figures, that of Christ Pantokrator and the Virgin Mary, are clothed in blue, given luminosity by a background of gold tiles. The work is of the highest order, displaying elegance in the draping of the figures' robes and in the sensitivity of their faces and gestures. It is considered the finest Byzantine mosaic in Italy and comparable to other fine Late Byzantine work from Constantinople.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The Byzantine mosaic decoration was completed before 1170. The lower part and the side walls of the presbyterium were not completed until the 17th century. They covered preceding paintings of which scarce traces remain today.

====Other artwork====
[[File:Cefalucathedralnight.jpg|thumb|The cathedral at night]]
Of the original painted decoration, a figure of [[Urban V]] from the late 14th century, on a column on the left aisle; and a "Madonna enthroned" from the 15th century, in the left arm of the transept, remain.

The basilica houses several funerary monuments, including a late Antique sarcophagus, a medieval one, and the notable sepulchre of the Bishop Castelli of the 18th century.

The 12th-century baptismal font, carved from a single block of stone, is decorated with four small sculpted lions. The church also houses a canvas of the Madonna from [[Antonello Gagini]]'s workshop (16th century) and a painted wooden cross by Guglielmo da Pesaro (1468). The organ is a large two-manual instrument with detached console and plain pipework, sitting above a panelled wooden case.

The nave's ceiling has a painted decoration with busts, fanciful animals and other motifs, probably the work of Arabic craftsmen.

Starting in 1985, the Palermo artist Michele Canzoneri was commissioned and has installed 72 modern, abstract, stained-glass windows based on episodes from the Old and New Testaments. These have aroused some controversy for their style.&lt;ref&gt;Grady, Ellen, ''Blue Guide Sicily,'' 7th Edition, Somerset Books, London, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Palæo-Christian mosaic====
Excavations in the cathedral area have brought to light parts of a 6th-century polychrome mosaic. They depict a dove drinking, parts of two other birds, two small trees, and a lily-shaped flower, enclosed in a frame with ogival and lozenge motifs.

This mosaic belonged probably to a pre-existing Byzantine basilica. This area of Cefalù was frequented at least up to the 8th century, when it was an [[episcopal see]].

 |ShortSummary    = [[Child psychologist]] Mike Painter returns to his home town of Iron Hill, Ohio nearly thirty years after an unknown serial killer murdered five local children, among them his twin brother, Eddie. Eddie's body was never found. His mother, Marla, is the only family member remaining in the area. Painter reconnects with friends Jessica and Gary (who is now the town's sheriff), and meets their daughter, Katie. Over dinner, Mike mentions ''Candle Cove'', a disturbing children's television series involving puppet pirates that they watched around the time of the murders, until it mysteriously went off the air. Katie tells Mike that she has seen the show recently. The next day Katie goes missing and Mike is under suspicion. Through Katie's brother, Dane, Mike realizes where he can find Katie. Mike follows a figure dressed as a skeleton who resembles one of the characters from the show. He discovers Katie alive in the woods where the murders took place. He carries Katie back to her family, unaware that she has left two of her teeth behind to be claimed by an eerie creature, whose skin is entirely made up of teeth. Marla tells Mike that when he and his brother were watching ''Candle Cove'' as children, they were actually watching [[noise (video)|static]] on the television.

 |ShortSummary    = Gary and Jessica are awoken by their son's screams after Katie stabs him with a [[hook (hand tool)|hook]]. Although Gary doesn't completely trust Mike, he allows him to talk to Katie at the hospital alone in order to discover what happened.  Meanwhile, Marla visits a television station to ask about ''Candle Cove''.  The technician remembers the program and shows Marla a fan-made recreation. But he tells her that [[Lost work|no tapes of the original show exist]], as it was impossible to record.  Mike finds more links to the ''Candle Cove'' imagery in Katie's drawing and uses it as a clue to visit an abandoned cement factory with his mother. Mike follows a mysterious figure into the factory alone and discovers the decomposed remains of his brother, Eddie. That night, Mike confesses to Marla that he killed Eddie as a child and buried his body, but that the corpse had been moved before the police dug up the grave site. Upset, Marla stabs Mike in the arm.  The next day Gary comes to the house and asks Mike to come with him to the police station for questioning.  However, along the way Mike realizes that Gary is taking him somewhere else.

 |ShortSummary    = Gary takes Mike to an empty house he had wanted to buy and handcuffs him in a chair.  Tim and Daphne arrive at the house where they all interrogate Mike about the murders of their family members, believing him responsible. Flashbacks reveal that ''Candle Cove'' inspired Eddie to kill Tim's bully brother, Gene, using psychic mind-control to make him walk off the edge of a cliff.  Eddie continued vengefully killing other children in a similar way before Mike stopped him by stabbing him with a hook.  In present day, the others doubt Mike's story and Tim shoots him in the shoulder in a struggle for the truth. Marla, Jessica, and deputy Amy arrive at the house as Tim and Daphne run away.  Seeing Mike's condition, Amy takes Gary into custody. Later, Daphne visits Mrs. Booth, her former teacher, who also lost a son in the murders. After explaining what happened with Mike at the house, Booth murders Daphne with an ice hook and returns to host a group of children watching ''Candle Cove'' on her television. It is revealed that the kids killed Tim when he was walking home as Booth buries the body. Mike's daughter, Lily, inexplicably arrives alone at Marla's house, even though she lives miles away.

Amy tells Mike about Jessica's murder and she agrees to let Gary out of custody to help him search Mrs. Booth's property. Gary discovers some teeth left on a fence post outside and Mike realizes that the ''Candle Cove'' props were fake.  He receives a phone call from Booth, who instructs him to meet her alone at an abandoned diner.  He goes there and witnesses Booth in the skeleton costume, controlling children into helping her commit murder. Later, she goes to Marla's house and she tells Mike and Marla how Eddie used his powers to control her seizures. It was also Eddie who created ''Candle Cove'', not her. Booth killed her own son as a sacrifice for Eddie, in order to increase his power and welcomes Eddie's return through Mike.  That night at a motel, the tooth creature lures Lily away.  As Mike attempts to extract his extra tooth, ''Candle Cove'' begins playing on the television, featuring a frightened Lily.

Mike's wife, Erica, demands to know where Lily is, but he insists that he is the only one who can save her.  He takes Erica to the site of the murders and loses consciousness, entering Eddie's [[Many-worlds interpretation|parallel world]], which is filled with strange rooms and monsters. When he finally comes face to face with his brother, Eddie allows Lily to leave if Mike will stay forever. Lily returns to reality by crawling through a TV and is greeted by her mother. Marla goes to the woods where she is attacked by Mrs. Booth.  Marla is rescued at the last minute by Amy, who shoots Booth before Marla finally stabs her skull with the hook. Mike convinces Eddie to stay for one more card game they played as kids, delaying him long enough for Marla to return to the woods and suffocate Mike's body before Eddie can possess it.  Unable to break free of his world, Eddie is forced to remain with Mike.

 |ShortSummary    = Margot tells Jules that she doesn't need her around and to leave her with the Father. Jules finds Seth where the no end house should be, but it's disappeared. She tells him that Margot has decided to stay with The Father and they stick together for comfort. J.T. goes to what he thinks is his home and sees a girl through the front window, where he then sees a version of himself with her. When he goes inside, his alternate version tells him that he's a better version of J.T. and he proceeds to kiss the girl. When J.T. protests saying he should be the one kissing the girl, the alternate J.T. attacks him with a liquor bottle and beats him multiple times over the head. Dylan is on a secret mission to find his wife, who was previously caught in a different version of the no end house, but she doesn't recognize him. The Father has memories of his wife when he touches Margot and this causes the wife's body to manifest in the garage, where he proceeds to tear the body apart and eat it.

'''Csodamalom Bábszínház (Magic Mill Puppet Theatre)''' of [[Miskolc]], [[Hungary]] was formed by [[puppeteer]] Tibor Korzsény in 1986 as an amateur company.
The name "Csodamalom" (Magic Mill) preserves the name of Fábián Mill, which was the former building of the company since then they had moved to 11, Kossuth Street. The theatre functioned as semi-official since 1988 and as official from 1992. Above the 50 play repertoire there are two or three premiers a year, usually a dramatizing classical [[Folklore|folk tale]]s. Uniquely in Hungary, they play [[musical theatre|musical]] puppet shows, including the puppet-pantomimes staged for adults, such as ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' by [[Mussorgsky]], ''[[Bolero (Ravel)|Bolero]]'' by [[Ravel]] and ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' by [[Carl Orff|Orff]].&lt;ref name=Az&gt;{{cite web|title=Az együttes rövid története|url=http://www.csodamalom.hu/tortenet.html|publisher=csodamalom|accessdate=8 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801014821/http://www.csodamalom.hu/tortenet.html|archivedate=1 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klára, Dobos, and Gábor, Mikita, and Béla, GYarmati. ''Csodamalom Bábszínház, Miskolc 2007...''. Miskolc, Redon4color ltd. 2007. p4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the last fifty years several attempts had been made to form a permanent puppet theatre in the city of Miskolc, which has outstanding theatrical traditions. In 1947 László Bod, later the director of [[Budapest]] State Puppet Theatre, tried to establish the genre in Miskolc.

In the middle 1980s, in the building known as Fábián Mill, initially two groups started their work. The first to perform here was the amateur puppetry led by János Czikora until 1989. Beside this group was the Csodamalom Puppet Theatre established in 1986 by Tibor Korzsény, who was a member of the State Puppet Theatre before, and artist of the Tokaj Varieté.

The first performance was on 26 September 1986 under the management of Tibor Korzsényi. It was an adaptation of a tale by the [[Grimm Brothers]] entitled ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]''.
The artists, including Anna Molnár, Valéria Egerszegi, Aszterisz Pacadisz were members of the [[Tokaj Varieté]], except Ildikó Gyürek.

Following this, Tibor Korzsényi gathered together young people who were interested in the genre. The group enlarged and changed throughout the years. In September, 1990 the higher education of puppeteers was launched with twelve students, under the professional supervision of the State Puppet Theatre.
The first shows' puppets were designed by Vera Bródy, and made in the workshop of the State Puppet Theatre by Emőke Szabó applied artist. Scenery were made in the workshop of the National Theatre of MIskolc under the direction of Attila Veres. Accompanying music was composed by composers of Miskolc, music teacher János Zoller and organist László Csabai.

The group soon grew out of its original location. In 1988 the theatre company, then being the amateur puppetry of the City Cultural Centre, received a group operational permit from the National Philharmony, then from 1992 the company was granted the license to work as professional theatre, and was relocated to the building of the former Studio Theatre in Kossuth Street, where they established their own workshop.

==Techniques==

In the beginning they carried on the traditions of the State Puppet Theatre playing mainly classic puppet shows for young children.

In recent years the group's professional activities are characterized by variety of techniques and genres. Amongst others the group put up plays based on [[Romani people|Roma]] genesis legends, but their series featuring traditional European [[fairy|fai]] puppet-show stories, or the stories of [[Czechoslovakia]]n cartoons formerly being very popular in Hungary have eventually built up a unique repertoire.

Beside hand or glovepuppets they apply several techniques in creating puppets. They make [[Wayang style|Wayang puppets]], and amongst the flat-puppets cut out from paper and installed onto posts, [[marionettes]] were used for example in the play, Háry János. Puppets in the [[King Matthias|King Mátyás]] tales are moved with a [[Opera dei Pupi|Sicilian marionette]] technique, while objects transformed into real actors in ''Rosszcsont Peti'' (Naughty Peter).

'''''Diamond Grill''''' is a 1996 semi-fictional [[biography]] by Canadian novelist and poet [[Fred Wah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butling|first=Pauline|title=Poets Talk|year=2005|publisher=University of Alberta|isbn=0888644310|pages=144–158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IY3TdnlXs4AC&amp;pg=PA145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was first published in 1996 by [[NeWest Press]], based in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]. ''Diamond Grill'' is told through both prose and poetry and utilizes a [[first person perspective|first person narrative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Joshua|title=Poets on Teaching: A Sourcebook|year=2010|publisher=University of Iowa Press|isbn=1587299046|pages=289–290|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2dLVe3p_loC&amp;pg=PA290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book won the Howard O’Hagan prize for short fiction and has been described by Wah as a way to explore his "[[hyphenated identity]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diamond Grill resurrected: Fred Wah at the Library|url=http://thenelsondaily.com/news/arts-and-culture/diamond-grill-resurrected-fred-wah-library-11296#.UMGqoOQ81qx|accessdate=7 December 2012|newspaper=Nelson Daily|date=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has also been credited with helping to popularize the term "biotext", a term coined by [[George Bowering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rak|first=Julie|title=Auto/Biography in Canada: Critical Directions|year=2005|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|isbn=0889204780|pages=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1Z1-9OI84gC&amp;pg=PA71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book describes Wah's experiences of the Diamond Grill, his father's restaurant in [[Nelson, British Columbia]], and of the impact of growing up as a child of mixed heritage in the 1950s. ''Diamond Grill'' also discusses other locations, such as different restaurants, China, and a hospital where his father was once held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kröller|first=Eva-Marie|title=The Cambridge Companion to Canadian Literature|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521891310|pages=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5urZGIq8aoC&amp;pg=PA260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
''Diamond Grill'' explores several different themes, with racial identity being one of the most predominant.&lt;ref name="ERTy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ty|first=Eleanor Rose|title=Asian Canadian Writing Beyond Autoethnography|year=2008|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|isbn=1554580234|pages=63–70, 147, 202|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SFXJihaEWAkC&amp;pg=PA70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilf|first=Suzanne|title=Towards a Transcultural Future|year=2005|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9042017368|pages=239–248|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLSQtD73RbgC&amp;pg=PA239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of imagery to explore the book's various themes has often been commented on by various academics, with the appearance of the Diamond Grill's swinging doors in the beginning and ending of the novel being described as a way of accentuating the difference between the "Occident and Orient".&lt;ref name="ERTy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Louie|first=Kam|title=Culture, Identity, Commodity: Diasporic Chinese Literatures in English|year=2006|publisher=Mcgill Queens Univ Pr|isbn=077353007X|pages=9, 136–142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXylVKnmlt8C&amp;pg=PA137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of ''Diamond Grill's'' chapters, Wah talks about how some people had difficulty associating Wah with his last name, as he is only 1/8th Chinese and looks predominantly Caucasian.&lt;ref name="EChang"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chang|first=Elaine|title=Reel Asian: Asian Canada on screen|year=2004|publisher=Coach House Books|isbn=1552451925|pages=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2K8wydShbgwC&amp;pg=PA56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaine Chang argues in her book ''Reel Asian: Asian Canada on screen'' that people do not react to an "almost-white" person with an Italian name in the same way that they would if that individual possessed a Chinese one, and that this reaction causes some to think "maybe you're not Canadian".&lt;ref name="EChang" /&gt;

The idea of food as it relates to culture has also been commented upon, with Vera Regan stating that Wah uses food as a way to connect his commentary to "tie him to his family, his culture, and his identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Regan|first=Vera|title=Multiculturalism and Integration: Canadian and Irish Experiences|year=2010|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|isbn=0776607227|pages=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UWTe9Ta-WRUC&amp;pg=PA237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the book's title, Pauline Butling described that being in the "Diamond Grill" meant to be in "[a] precious and yet contradictory space of interrogation, to be either 'colourless or tinted'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunting|first=Pauline|title=Writing in Our Time: Canada's Radical Poetries in English (1957-2003)|year=2005|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|isbn=978-0-88920-430-0|pages=105–108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2PEKKv8PN9gC&amp;pg=PT125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critical reception for the book has been positive, with ''Canadian Literature'' praising ''Diamond Grill's'' complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beauregard|first=Guy|title=Book Review: Rattling a Noisy Hyphen|url=http://canlit.ca/reviews/rattling_a_noisy_hyphen|publisher=Canadian Literature|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quill &amp; Quire]] called the book "beguiling" and wrote that it gave them "much to think about on the subject of identity, particularly how we and our society collude, often destructively, in its construction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Diamond Grill  by Fred Wah|url=http://www.quillandquire.com/reviews/review.cfm?review_id=819|publisher=Quill &amp; Quire|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Emblem of the State of [[Israel]]''' ({{lang-he|סמל מדינת ישראל|Semel Medinat Yisra'el}}; {{lang-ar|شعار دولة إسرائيل|translit=shiear dawlat 'iisrayiyl}}) shows a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] surrounded by an [[olive]] branch on each side, and the writing "{{Hebrew|ישראל}}" (Hebrew for ''Israel'') below it. Most commonly light blue and white, the coat of arms does appear in different colour combinations depending on the use (see below).

==History==
[[Image:Arch of Titus Menorah.png|300px|left|thumb|The image used on the emblem is based on a depiction of the menorah on the [[Arch of Titus]].]]

The State of Israel adopted the symbol after a design competition held in 1948. The design is based on the winning entry submitted by [[Gabriel and Maxim Shamir]]'s proposal, with elements taken from other submissions, including entries from Oteh Walisch, W. Struski, Itamar David, Yerachmiel Schechter, and [[Willie Wind]], whose entry won the first design competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinosoria.com/israel_naissance.html |title=Israel.

==Symbolism==
The image used on the emblem is based on a depiction of the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] on the [[Arch of Titus]]. The menorah was used in the ancient [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and has been a symbol of [[Judaism]] since ancient times. It symbolizes universal enlightenment, based on what is written in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 60: "Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn".

The emblem may also be based on the vision of the biblical prophet [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], chapter 4, where he describes seeing a menorah flanked by two olive trees, one on each side.&lt;ref name=sacks&gt;Mishory, Alec.

The [[olive branch]]es symbolize [[peace]]. The symbol is used on coinage.

The '''Eskimo–Uralic''' hypothesis posits that the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] language families belong to a common [[language family]] of which they are the two branches. Although substantial arguments for the hypothesis have been made, it is not generally accepted by [[linguist]]s. The best-known advocate of the Eskimo–Uralic hypothesis is [[Knut Bergsland]]. The hypothesis dates back to the pioneering Danish linguist [[Rasmus Rask]] in 1818, upon noticing similarities between [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic Eskimo]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10279">'''Ethnocultural empathy''' refers to the understanding of [[feeling]]s of individuals that are ethnically and/or culturally different from oneself. This concept casts doubts on global [[empathy]], which assumes that empathy is "feeling in oneself the feelings of others" and is not specifically targeting any one group (e.g. age, gender, and ethnicity) or context.&lt;ref this is the &gt;Rasoal, C., Jungert, T., Hau, S., Stiwne, E. e., &amp; Andersson, G. (2009). Ethnocultural empathy among students in health care education. Evaluation &amp; Health Professions 32(3), 300-313.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnocultural empathy, on the other hand, assumes that empathy toward others probably increases if the other is similar to oneself in terms of [[ethnicity]], [[gender]], age, or [[Culture|cultural]] background.

== Concept history ==
Traditionally, empathy is roughly defined as an [[intellectual]] ability of taking the role or perspective of another person and/or an [[emotional]] response to another person with the same emotional display.&lt;ref&gt;Gladstein, G. A. (1977). Empathy and counseling outcome: An empirical and conceptual review. The Counseling Psychologist, 6(4), 70-79.&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of personal traits, empathy has been established as relatively stable and consistent within a certain time period.&lt;ref&gt;Mangione, S., Kane, Sh't G. C., Caruso, J. W., Gonnella, J. S., Nasca, T. J., &amp; Hojat, M, (2002). Assessment of empathy in different years of internal medicine training. Medical Teacher, 24, 370-373.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unger, L. S., &amp; Thunuluri, L. K., (1997). Trait empathy and continuous helping: The case of voluntarism. Journal of Social Behavior and Personality, 12, 785-800.&lt;/ref&gt; However, increasing research found that people usually hold different levels of empathy toward different individuals based on perceived [[Similarity (psychology)|psychological similarity]]. Two primary factors influencing the psychological similarity are [[Ethnic group|ethnics]] and [[culture]]. Particularly, people usually feel more empathetic towards individuals who are in the same ethnic/cultural groups as they are than those who are not.

Quintana&lt;ref&gt;Quintana, S. M. (1994). A model of ethnic perspective-taking ability applied to Mexican-American children and youth. International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 18, 419-448.&lt;/ref&gt; defined ethnic perspective taking as a cognitive–developmental ability that could be reached as an individual proceeds through developmental life stages.&lt;ref&gt;DeAngelis, T. (2001). All you need is contact. Monitor on Psychology, 32(10), 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quintana, S. M., Castaneda-English, P., &amp; Ybarra, V. C. (1999). Role of perspective-taking abilities and ethnic socialization in development of adolescent ethnic identity. Journal of Research on Adolescence, 9, 161-184.&lt;/ref&gt; This development contains five stages of ethnic perspective-taking ability, including (1) physicalistic and observable perspective, (2) literal perspective, (3) non-literal and social perspective, (4) group perspective and (5) multicultural perspective of ethnicity. First, children begin to establish their ethnic [[Cultural identity|identity]] by distinguishing themselves from other ethnic groups based on physical features. Once children understand the physical differences with other groups, they then are able to become aware of the [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspectives]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, [[experience]]s shared by other ethnic groups, and finally develop the ability to take the perspective of other ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Quintana, S. M., Castaneda-English, P., &amp; Ybarra, V. C. (1999). Role of perspective-taking abilities and ethnic socialization in development of adolescent ethnic identity. Journal of Research on Adolescence, 9, 161-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ridley and Lingle&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, C. R., &amp; Lingle, D. W. (1996). Cultural empathy in multicultural counseling: A multidimensional process model. In P. B. P. J. G. Draguns (Ed.), Counseling across cultures (4th ed., pp. 21–46). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; have defined cultural empathy as a "learned ability" which is composed of three subordinate processes: [[cognitive]], [[affective]], and [[Communication|communicative]]. Cognitive process can be understood as a cultural perspective-taking and cultural self–other differentiation. Affective process includes [[wikt:vicarious|vicarious]] affect and the expressive concern. Communicative process includes probing for insight and conveying accurate understanding.

Based on the ethnic perspective of perception and culture difference of empathy, Wang and her colleague&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Y. W., Davidson, M. M., Yakushko, O. F., Savoy, H. B., Tan, J. A., &amp; Bleier, J. K. (2003). The Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy: Development, validation, and reliability. Journal of Consulting Psychology, 50(2), 221-234.&lt;/ref&gt; posed the concept "ethnocultural empathy". Although this is a new concept, many previous research had addressed similar or related constructs although never formally terms it. Thus, concepts such as cultural empathy,&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, C. R., &amp; Lingle, D. W. (1996). Cultural empathy in multicultural counseling: A multidimensional process model. In P. B. P. J. G. Draguns (Ed.), Counseling across cultures (4th ed., pp. 21–46). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;  empathetic multicultural awareness,&lt;ref&gt;Junn, E. N., Morton, K. R., &amp; Yee, I. (1995). The "Gibberish" exercise: Facilitating empathetic multicultural awareness. Journal of Instructional Psychology, 22, 324-329.&lt;/ref&gt; ethnic perspective taking&lt;ref&gt;Quintana, S. M., Ybarra, V. C., Gonzalez-Doupe, P., &amp; Baessa, Y. D. (2000). Cross-cultural evaluation of ethnic perspective-taking ability: An exploratory investigation with U.S. Latino and Guatemalan Latino Children. Cultural Diversity &amp; Ethnic Minority Psychology, 6, 334-351.&lt;/ref&gt; are usually used interchangeably with "ethnocultural empathy".

== Constructs and measurements ==

To date, the Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy (SEE) is the only formally published measurement of ethnocultural empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Y. W., Davidson, M. M., Yakushko, O. F., Savoy, H. B., Tan, J. A., &amp; Bleier, J. K. (2003). The Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy: Development, validation, and reliability. Journal of Consulting Psychology, 50(2), 221-234.&lt;/ref&gt; SEE is composed of three instrumental aspects: [[intellectual]] empathy, empathic [[emotion]]s, and the [[communication]] of those two.

Intellectual empathy is the ability to understand a racially or ethnically different person's thinking and/or feeling. It is also the ability to perceive the world as the other person does; that is, racial or ethnic perspective taking.

The empathic emotions component of ethnocultural empathy is [[attention]] to the feeling of a person or persons from another ethnocultural group to the degree that one is able to feel the other's emotional condition from the point of view of that person's racial or ethnic culture. In addition, it refers to a person's emotional response to the emotional display of a person or persons from another ethnocultural group.

The communicative empathy component is the expression of ethnocultural empathic thoughts (intellectual empathy) and feelings (empathic emotions) toward members of racial and ethnic groups different from one's own. This component can be expressed through words or actions.

== Application ==
Ethnocultural empathy is usually applied in cross-culture and/or cross-ethnics analysis. The levels of ethnocultural empathy were reported to vary by [[demographic]] features and societal factors. Previous research indicated that women were more likely to report higher level of ethnocultural empathy than men,&lt;ref&gt;Cundiff, N. L., &amp; Komarraju, M. (2008). Gender differences in ethnocultural empathy and attitudes toward men and women in authority. ''[[Journal of Leadership &amp; Organizational Studies]]'', 15(1), 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Y. W., Davidson, M. M., Yakushko, O. F., Savoy, H. B., Tan, J. A., &amp; Bleier, J. K. (2003). The Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy: Development, validation, and reliability. Journal of Consulting Psychology, 50(2), 221-234.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-White individuals{{where|date=September 2011}} were found to have significantly higher levels of general and specific ethnocultural empathy than their White counterparts. Racism was negatively associated with ethnocultural empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Spanierman, L. B., Poteat, V. P., Beer, A. M., &amp; Armstrong, P. I. (2006). Psychosocial costs of racism to Whites: Exploring patterns through cluster analysis. Journal of Counseling Psychology, 53, 434-441.&lt;/ref&gt;

People with different levels of ethnocultural empathy were also reported to respond distinctively to individuals who are similar with themselves and those who are not. For example, people with higher level of enthnocultural empathy had been found to work more successfully with individuals from other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, K. I., &amp; Van Oudenhoven, J. P. (2000). The multicultural personality questionnaire: A multidimensional instrument of multicultural effectiveness. European Journal of Personality, 14, 291-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enthnocultural empathy not only functioned in of enthocultural empathy were reported to be predictive of positive attitude towards [[minority group]]s, such as [[rape victim]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Sakalh-Ugurlu, N., Yalcin, Z. S., &amp; Glick, P. (2007). Ambivalent sexism, belief in a just world, and empathy as predictors of Turkish students' attitude toward rape victims. Sex Roles, 57, 889-895.&lt;/ref&gt; [[domestic violence]] victims,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, C. D. (2005). Domestic violence perceptions: Is diversity really a factor? Doctoral dissertations, Tennessee State University, Nashville. Retrieved from&lt;/ref&gt; female leaders,&lt;ref&gt;Cundiff, N. L., &amp; Komarraju, M. (2008). Gender differences in ethnocultural empathy and attitudes toward men and women in authority. Journal of Leadership &amp; Organizational Studies, 15(1), 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

Enthnocultural cultural empathy has been used in many other research areas such as [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialism]], [[feminism]], [[multiculturalism]], ethnic identity, etc.

'''''Europe Today''''' is a theatre show produced in cooperation between [[East West Theatre Company]] and [[Slovene National Theatre, Maribor|Slovene National Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sng-mb.si/za-medije/press-release-europe-today-the-biggest-theatre-co-production-in-south-east-europe/ Slovene National Theatre: Europe Today – the biggest theatre co-production in South East Europe &amp;#91;cited December 07, 2011&amp;#93;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323142505/http://www.sng-mb.si/za-medije/press-release-europe-today-the-biggest-theatre-co-production-in-south-east-europe/ |date=March 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is based on an essay written by [[Miroslav Krleza]] and directed by [[Haris Pasovic]]. Production also included [[Miki Manojlovic]], an actor; [[Edward Clug]], a contemporary dancer and choreographer; as well as the industrial, neoclassical band [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastwest.ba/europe-today/ East West Theatre Company Website: Europe Today &amp;#91;cited December 07, 2011&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; The dramaturgy of the production was done by Dubravka Vrgoc, director of Zagreb Youth Theatre. The artists, who reside in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, rehearsed in [[Maribor]]'s [[Slovene National Theatre, Maribor|Slovene National Theatre]] during February 2011. The show opened February 16 and it provoked great regional and international interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/15936ec0-3f75-11e0-a1ba-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1Eq631acg/ Financial Times Website: ''Europe Today, Slovenian National Theatre, Maribor'' by [[Ian Shuttleworth]]; Published: February 23 2011 &amp;#91;cited December 07, 2011&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The poster image for ''Europe Today'' depicts an SA-style trooper, but instead of the swastika, his armband and the flag he carries show the 12 stars of the EU. The image is partly playful, a homage to the [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]] art movement whose most prominent exponents, the band [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]], are collaborators in this Serbian-Bosnian-Croatian-Slovenian-Romanian-created work, which in 2011 played in [[Maribor]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. 
The show is a 75-minute collage of words and images: Serbian actor [[Miki Manojlović]] recites Krleža’s words, Romanian-born dancer and choreographer [[Edward Clug]] represents its arguments in movement while Laibach performs a number of radically reimagined European national anthems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/cc7a5fc6-6b9f-11e0-93f8-00144feab49a.html#axzz1eQhgeYgi/ Financial Times: ''Europe in pieces'' by [[Ian Shuttleworth]]; published April 23, 2011 (accessed January 17, 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15822">'''Everyday Aesthetics''' is a recent subfield of philosophical [[aesthetics]] focusing on everyday events, settings and activities in which the faculty of [[sensibility]] is saliently at stake. [[Alexander Baumgarten]] established Aesthetics as a discipline and defined it as ''scientia cognitionis sensitivae'', the science of sensory knowledge, in his foundational work ''Aesthetica'' (1750).&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/aestheticascrip00baumgoog&lt;/ref&gt; This field has been dedicated since then to the clarification of [[fine arts]], [[beauty]] and [[taste]] only marginally referring to the aesthetics in [[design]], [[crafts]], urban environments and social practice until the emergence of everyday aesthetics during the ‘90s. As other subfields like environmental aesthetics or the [[aesthetics of nature]], everyday aesthetics also attempts to countervail aesthetics' almost exclusive focus on the philosophy of art.

== Grounding aesthetics in experience ==

Aesthetic inquiry on everyday life owes much of its approach to [[John Dewey]]’s (1934) pragmatist aesthetics, even if he was interested in grounding mainly artistic experience. Dewey pointed at a variety of circumstances in which sensibility is present emphasizing the importance of feeling, energy, and rhythm in every creature’s intercourse with its environment. He thus stressed not only the artistic but the everyday doings and undergoings that involve alertness and intensity of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John ''Art as Experience'' (New York: Perigee,1934)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey explored aesthetics from the subjects' experience rather than from objects' status as artworks and museum collections. This turn would allow overcoming object-centric approaches to aesthetics that hindered any consideration of the aesthetic beyond artistic and beautiful things justifiable by intrinsic qualities categorized as aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Updating Dewey’s pragmatism, [[Richard Shusterman]] validates aesthetic experience and emphasizes the role of the body in what he defines as ''soma-aesthetics'' also related to everyday life. C.F. Shusterman, Richard ''Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics'' ( Cambridge University Press 2008). See also Shusterman, Richard. 1992.

== Social dimension of everyday aesthetics ==

The neglect of aesthetic theory to consider the role of sensibility in everyday life was first pointed out by [[Katya Mandoki]] who in 1994 coined the word '''''Prosaics'''''&lt;ref&gt;Mandoki Katya, ''Prosaica; introducción a la estética de lo cotidiano'' (México: Grijalbo, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; (drawing a distinction from [[Aristotle]]’s '''''Poetics'''''&lt;ref&gt;[[Poetics (Aristotle)]]&lt;/ref&gt; focused on art) to denote a sub-discipline that would specifically inquire the aesthetics involved in daily activities emphasizing the styles and forms of expression in [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] and context determined interactions. Prosaics or the theory of everyday aesthetics analyzes in this and subsequent texts the social conventions on what is considered acceptable or not by implicit standards of taste in each institutional setting (school, family, religion, politics, artworld, medical practice, sports). Six books and several articles i.e. ''Everyday Aesthetics; Prosaics, social identities and the play of culture'' (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Mandoki Katya, ''Everyday Aesthetics; Prosaics, social identities and the play of culture'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), ''Estética cotidiana y juegos de la cultura: Prosaica I'' (México: Siglo XXI editores, 2006,  ''Prácticas estéticas e identidades sociales: Prosaica II'' (México: Siglo XXI editores, 2006), ''La construcción estética del Estado y de la identidad nacional: Prosaica III'' (México: Siglo XXI editores, 2007), ''Estética y comunicación; de acción, pasión y seducción'' (Bogotá: Norma, 2007), “Quotidian Aesthetics” ''New Perspectives in Aesthetics and Philosophy of Art. Annales d’ esthétique''. Volume 42/2003-2004. Athens: Panayotis and Effie Michelis Foundation. Pp. 103-110. ISSN 1105-0462. "L'esthétique du quotidien"  ''Diogène'' 2011/1-2 (n° 233-234). [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/ca/7523862.0008.004?rgn=main;view=fulltext]
&lt;/ref&gt; consistently analyze the wide spectrum of the non-artistic within personal and collective experience. The role of the aesthetic is examined through symbolic interaction, identity negotiation and dramaturgical performance to produce specific sensitive effects and impact upon sensibility. As a multi-sensorial phenomenon, prosaics pays attention to the whole range of sensorial display for affecting participants' sensibility (body language, the visual, setting and props, intonation and styles of language) and not only sight and hearing as has been customary in aesthetics.

== Political dimension, violence and negativity in everyday aesthetics ==

An approach to everyday aesthetics involves both the positive and negative, the enriching and the toxic effects operating on sensibility. Joseph H. Kupfer brought to the attention of aesthetic inquiry the importance of focusing on the effects of violence and ultraviolence in modern society. Kupfer makes explicit the aesthetic ground of violence in society and emphasizes destruction as an aesthetic process producing vivid sensations.&lt;ref&gt;Kupfer Joseph H., ''Experience as Art: Aesthetics in Everyday Life'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; He highlighted also the need of incorporating aesthetics to education not only by means of teaching art but aesthetically, i.e. in the manner itself of educating through the rhythm, organization of subject matter, and method of presentation to engage students with the content of study.  Mandoki points at the negative use of aesthetics for manipulating emotions in the political sphere and refers to Nazi propaganda as a case in point that exemplifies the deliberate use of aesthetics for exerting violence.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Mandoki, "Terror and Aesthetics: Nazi Strategies for Mass Organisation," in Fascism: Critical Concepts in Political Science, vol. III, Fascism and Culture, Part 7: Fascism as the Negation or Revolution of Culture, ed. Roger Griffin (New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 21-38.return to text&lt;/ref&gt; The utilization of aesthetics for political agendas, specifically in the legitimation of the nation-state is dealt by this author.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Mandoki, ''La construcción estética del estado y de la identidad nacional''. (Mexico: Siglo veintiuno editores, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold Berleant]] has stressed the negative aspect of everyday aesthetics pointing at the importance of the aesthetic impact of terrorism as well as the use of aesthetics in the political sphere. Berleant brings up other extreme situations that provoke perceptual injury or damage as contemporary urban overcrowding and visual over stimulation, space pollution, claustrophobic and oppressive conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Berleant, Arnold ''Sensibility and Sense; The aesthetic transformation of the human world'' ( Imprint Academic 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; For Berleant, aesthetics implies active, intense aesthetic engagement and is thus involved in both positive and negative effects of everyday contemporary urban settings.&lt;ref&gt;Berleant, Arnold. 1991. Art and Engagement. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For Berleant aesthetics of the environment has been a sustained object of research for more than two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Berleant The Aesthetics of Environment (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1992.

== Beauty in daily life, environmental aesthetics and artification ==
[[Yi-Fu Tuan]] proposed that we should apply the traditional aesthetic categories of beauty, contemplation, disinterestedness, and distancing in valuing daily life through different non artistic objects and locations.[http://www.yifutuan.org/]&lt;ref&gt;Tuan Yi–Fu ''Passing Strange and Wonderful; Aesthetics, Nature and Culture'' (New York, Tokyo, London: Kodansha 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 1974 he insisted on the need of paying due attention to the environment as object of aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Tuan,Yi–Fu. ''Topophilia; A Study of Environmental Perception, Attitudes and Values''(Englewood Cliff, N.J.: Prentice Hall 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;  Along this line Crispin Sartwell also proposed in 1995 applying aesthetics to life itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sartwell, Crispin ''The Art of Living: Aesthetics of the Ordinary in World Spiritual Traditions''. (Albany: State University of New York Press 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Yuriko Saito, an environmentalist aesthetician specializing in Japanese aesthetics, argues for paying attention to weather as worthy of aesthetic appreciation and for making moral and aesthetic judgments on everyday artifacts, landscapes, lawns, and neighborhood eyesores&lt;ref&gt;[[Eyesore]]&lt;/ref&gt; that are conflicting with the harmony of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, Yuriko. 2008. ''Everyday Aesthetics''. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Saito advocates a self-critical artification of everyday life and warns about the risks of artificating business.[http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=640] Paulina Rautio has performed qualitative analysis by interviews and epistolary exchange with women in regards to their experience of beauty through non artistic items and their contexts such as hanging laundry in Lapland where the opportunity of drying clothes under the sun is rare.&lt;ref&gt;Rautio, Pauliina, Rautio, P. (2010). Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives. ''Journal of Aesthetic Education'', Vol 44, No4, Rautio, P. (2009). On hanging laundry. The place of beauty in managing everyday life. Contemporary Aesthetics, Vol 7, No9.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a common interest in this approach for understanding aesthetics as a theory of art and beauty following traditional categories and at the same time attempting to go beyond conventional borders of art by artificating the non art and extending its scope to everyday objects, environments and to living itself. That is the case of Horacio Pérez-Henao who tries to interpret literature under the scope of everyday aesthetics by pointing out how fictional characters experience aesthetics into their daily lives &lt;ref&gt;Pérez-Henao, Horacio. “Estética cotidiana y ficción: el clima como elemento
de significación en la novela Pequod de Vitor Ramil”. Anclajes XX. 1 (enero-abril
2016): 20-34.

== Sports and food as art ==

Every work of art has, since the Renaissance, tried to expand themes worthy of artistic expression and concepts of artistic value to include new subject matters, techniques and styles in painting and sculpture, new harmonies, consonances or dissonances in music, new attitudes, gestures, and different genres and requirements of quality. However the initiative of applying the concept of art literally to non artistic activities within a theoretical framework related to everyday aesthetics came from philosophers like David Best, Wolfgang Welsch and Lev Kreft proposing to consider sports as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;Best, David. 1988. “The Aesthetic in Sport,” in ''Philosophic Inquiry in Sport'', ed. William J. Morgan and Klaus V. Meier. Champaign: Human Kinetics Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welsch, Wolfgang "Sport–Viewed Aesthetically, and Even as Art?" in Light, Andrew &amp; Smith, Jonathan M. (eds.) ''The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (New York: Columbia University Press. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kreft, Lev "Aesthetics of the beautiful game" ''Soccer &amp; Society'' 2012: 1-23&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist aestheticians are also advocating for the inclusion of other senses beyond the two traditional sight and hearing, as in taste ([[Carolyn Korsmeyer]]) and smell (Emily Brady), that can render aesthetic experiences in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Emily "Sniffing and Savoring: The Aesthetics of Smells and Tastes" in Light, Andrew &amp; Smith, Jonathan M. (eds.) ''The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (New York: Columbia University Press 2005); Korsmeyer, Carolyn ''Making Sense of Taste: Food &amp; Philosophy'' (New York: Cornell University Press 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
Carolyn Korsmeyer, M. Quinet and Glenn Kuehn argue for including food among aesthetically relevant objects and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Quinet, M.L. 1981. “Food as Art: The Problem of Function”. ''British Journal of Aesthetic''s. 21, 1: 159-171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn, Glenn "How Can Food Be Art?" in Light, Andrew &amp; Smith, Jonathan M. (eds.) ''The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (New York: Columbia University Press. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

== The categories of the ordinary as aesthetic ==
Another line emerging from analytic aesthetics and the American Society of Aesthetics has been lately discussing the expansion of aesthetics’ category repertoire to include other qualities (cuteness, prettiness, messiness, neatness, cuddleness loveliness, organized, disorganized)&lt;ref&gt;Leddy, Thomas. 1995. 'Everyday Surface Aesthetic Qualities: "Neat", "Messy", "Clean", "Dirty"'''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', 53, 259-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Leddy, Thomas''The Extraordinary in the Ordinary: The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (Broadview Press 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other types of ordinary experiences (i.e. scratching an itch, playing with a pencil).&lt;ref&gt;Irvin,Sherri “Scratching an Itch,” Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 66, 1 (2008), 25-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hind-Pak Bordernama''''' (2015) is a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] [[novel]] written by Nirmal Singh Nimma Langha. This is an autobiographical work based on Nimma's own love story.&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bordernama: A real story of cross-border love affair|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/community/bordernama-a-real-story-of-cross-border-love-affair/145276.html|accessdate=27 July 2016}}, The Tribune newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HT"&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/novel-on-indo-pak-love-story-based-on-true-incidents-released/story-8yWJD20FGsDI7lFZ50hM4N.html, Hindustan Times newspaper, Published 10 Oct 2015, Retrieved 27 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
In 1981 Langha, an Indian [[Sikh]], was studying for an M.A. degree in [[Punjabi literature]] at [[Guru Nanak Dev University]], [[Amritsar]] in [[India]]. There he got influenced by [[Naxalite movement]] and started to write songs and poems. At that time, he fell in love with Naseema, a [[Muslim]] girl from [[Punjab, Pakistan]]. To meet the girl, Langha crossed the India-Pakistan border several times, in the 1980s, without any visa or authorization. According to Langha, Naseema too crossed the border once and visited [[Punjab, India]] and [[Delhi]]. After two and a half years, Langha was arrested by a Pakistani security agency. Naseema fought very hard and even arranged {{INRConvert|4|l}} to have Langha released. In 1986, Langha met Naseema for the last time. In 1988, barbed wires were installed on the India-Pakistan border. After that they never met again.&lt;ref name="Tribune" /&gt;

==Novel's publication ==
Langha told his story to Punjabi writer [[Gurbachan Singh Bhullar]] and Bhullar suggested to pen it down. Following this suggestion, Langha started writing this novel in 1995, but no publisher was ready to publish it because the novel contained details of illegal immigration. In 2015, the novel was published by Chak Staran Prakashan. The book launching event took place on 10 October 2015 at 'Punjabi Bhawan' in [[Ludhiana]].&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;

== Overview of the history of Pristina ==
{{details|Pristina#History}}
The city of Pristina has always been an area in flux with people coming and going. It has been inhabited for nearly 10.000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=K.85/&gt; The early [[Neolithic]] findings dating from the 8th century BC were discovered in the areas surrounding Pristina such as: Matiqan, [[Gračanica, Kosovo|Gracanica]] and [[Ulpiana]].&lt;ref name=K.85/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chapman 2000|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosova &gt; Prishtina|url=http://www.albanian.com/information/countries/kosova/prishtin/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Roman period, Pristina was part of the province of [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]]  and nearby Ulpiana which was considered one of the most important Roman cities in the whole [[Balkans]], became a Roman municipium in the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref name=K.85/&gt;&lt;ref name=archeological&gt;{{cite web|title=Archaeological Guide of Kosovo|url=http://www.mkrs-ks.org/repository/docs/drafti_i_guides_-anglisht_final.pdf|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The city was damaged by an earthquake in AD 518 and it was again rebuilt by the Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian]] I who renamed it Iustiniana Secunda.&lt;ref name=K.85/&gt; By the arrival of [[Slavs]] in the 6th century, the city fell again in reconstruction.&lt;ref name=K.85/&gt;
During the 14th and the 15th century, Pristina was classified as an important mining and trading center on the Balkan market due to its position near the rich mining town of [[Novo Brdo]].

The city was once home to a Jewish community numbering over 1,500 people, who settled in the Balkans during the late 15th century from Spain after escaping the [[Reconquista]].&lt;ref name=KSI.14/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pocket.33&gt;{{cite book|title=Prishtina in your Pocket|date=Spring–Summer 2011|page=33|url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/data/download/pristina.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=K.130&gt;{{cite book|last=Warrander|first=Gail|title=Kosovo|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides Ltd, UK|isbn=978-1-84162-331-3|pages=130|url=http://www.bradtguides.com/|author2=Verena Knaus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until 2011, the cemetery was in a devastating condition due to neglect; it was then restored by a team of international and Kosovan university students,&lt;ref name = ballkan.s&gt;{{cite book|last=Osmani|first=Shengjyl|title=Students Restore Jewish Cemetery in Pristina|date=12 July 2011|publisher=BalkanInsight|location=Pristina|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/students-restore-jewish-cemetery-in-pristina}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was afterwards vandalized by unknown subjects.

==== Tjerrtorja ====
Tjerrtorja was a neolithic settlement which was identified accidentally in the 1950s somewhere around the outskirts of Pristina. The neolithic site was named after the discovery place, where a factory was started to be built known as the cotton and textile production plant Tjerrtorja.&lt;ref name=Tjerrtorja&gt;{{cite web|title='Tjerrtorja' Archeological Site (listed since 1955)|url=http://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=178|publisher=ESI - "European Stability Initiative"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The area was believed to have had an abundant collection of terracotta figurines, human shaped statues and baked clay anthropomorphic artifacts. One of the most impressive terracotta figurines which has been discovered after some continuous excavation within this area was called “The Goddess on Throne”.&lt;ref name=K.Archeological&gt;{{cite book|last=Berisha|first=Milot|title=Kosovo Archaeological Guide|year=2012|publisher=Kosovo Ministry of Culture Youth and Sports and Archaeological Institute of Kosovo|pages=26, 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mausoleum of Sultan Murat I ====
The Mausoleum of [[Murat I|Sultan Murat I]], also known as ''Bajraktari Türbe'', is a religious object built in honour of Sultan Murat I, who was killed in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389.&lt;ref name=K.guide/&gt;&lt;ref name=K.141&gt;{{cite book|last=Warrander|first=Gail|title=Kosovo|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides Ltd, UK|isbn=978-1-84162-331-3|pages=141|url=http://www.bradtguides.com/|author2=Verena Knaus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building constructed in 1850, does not actually contain the remains of Sultan Murat since they have been moved to the imperial museum in [[Bursa, Turkey]].&lt;ref name=Pocket.34&gt;{{cite book|title=Prishtina in your Pocket|date=Spring–Summer 2011|page=34|url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/data/download/pristina.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is currently in a bad state since it was heavily damaged during the [[Kosovo War]].&lt;ref name=K.141/&gt; In addition to a garden, there is little to see inside of the building; an important feature of the garden is a 700‑year‑old mulberry tree which survived from the war.&lt;ref name=K.141/&gt; A small group of people from Pristina who follow the Sadije Dervish order, of which Sultan Murat’s standard- bearer is believed to have been a member, try to look after and to keep the building protected from the further decay.&lt;ref name=K.141/&gt;

=== Former Hotel Union building ===
[[File:Hotel Unioni, Prishtinë.jpg|thumb|The restored Hotel Union]]

The building of the former “Hotel Union” was built in 1927 under the supervision of the Austrian architect, Andrija Kremer.&lt;ref name =Q.Hotel.union/&gt;&lt;ref name = yllipress&gt;{{cite web|title=Hotel Unioni do të rindërtohet|url=http://www.yllpress.com/17661/hotel-unioni-do-te-rindertohet.html|publisher=YllPress|language=Albanian|date=04-10-2010 &lt;!-- , 21:42 --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Union Hotel building|url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/kosovo/pristina/sightseeing/other-sights/Union-Hotel-building_29491v|publisher=In Your Pocket}}&lt;/ref&gt; It combined elements of [[neo-Renaissance]], [[neo-baroque]] and [[Art Nouveau]] and was one of the few buildings in Pristina with European-architecture influence. During the first few decades of its existence, it was named “Hotel Skënderbeu” after the 15th century Albanian resistance leader, [[Skanderbeg]] and this was witnessed by his ingrained icons on the building. After World War II, the building was nationalized by the government and was renamed as “Hotel Union”.&lt;ref name =Q.Hotel.union/&gt; The discussions for the future of the building sparked in 2008 when the Municipality of Pristina announced its intentions of flattening the building of the former “Hotel Union”, under the pretense that it did not possess any noteworthy architectural value and that it should make way for the new boulevard “Ibrahim Rugova” that was to be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoxha|first=Kreshnik|title=Prishtina: Qyteti Nën Okupim|url=http://www.gazetajnk.com/?cid=1,1012,2523|publisher=Gazeta - "Jeta në Kosovë"|location=Prishtinë|language=Albanian|date=Qershor 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Union.balkan&gt;{{cite web|last=Vrapi|first=Belinda|title=Pristina's Union Hotel to be Bulldozed|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/pristina-s-union-hotel-to-be-bulldozed|publisher=Balkan Insight|location=Prishtina|language=Albanian|date=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was confirmed by some experts who assessed that about 80% of the historical values had been irreversibly damaged.&lt;ref name= yllipress/&gt; This was met with objections by groups who advocated for its restoration to its original state. Also, the Institute for the Protection of Monuments of Kosovo voiced its recommendation for the immediate restoration on a publication.&lt;ref name="Hotel Unioni në flakë"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hotel Unioni në flakë|url=http://www.evropaelire.org/content/article/1805257.html|publisher=Radio Evropa e Lirë|language=Albanian|date=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Union&gt;{{cite web|last=Mullaademi|first=Leart|title=Union Hotel in Prishtina on fire|url=http://onupmagazine.com/2009/08/union-hotel-in-prishtina-on-firevideo/|pages =11, 53|date=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monuments no longer existing ===

==== Old Hammam ====

The Old Hammam belongs to those cultural monuments that have been collapsed throughout times but are still remembered as objects with tremendous impacts in a country’s historical culture. According to some sources, the hammam was built in the 15th century around the same time as the Great Hammam.&lt;ref name = coe.30&gt;{{cite web|title=CONSERVATION BASIS FOR THE "HISTORIC CENTRE" OF PRISHTINË|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/cooperation/kosovo/publications/20130129-PristinaCS.pdf|page=30|language=English, Albanian, Serbian|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there is nothing left from it and even its ruins that were discovered closed to today’s government building, have been covered rapidly by former town planners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundations of the Old Hammam (listed since 1959)|url=http://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=176|publisher=ESI - "European Stability Initiative"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It had more than 300 shops as well as other objects such as: the mosque, the main Christian church, the old Ottoman hammam, a synagogue and a huge number of houses belonging to the old Ottoman architecture.&lt;ref name=KSI.12/&gt;

== Current state ==

=== Restoration ===
Several of the historical monuments in Pristina have undergone through an irregular restoration process, whose aim was to preserve the cultural and historical heritage of the city. Among these, the Sultan Mehmet Fatih Mosque, the Carshi Mosque, the Saint Nicholas Church, the clock tower, the Jewish cemetery all underwent through separate processes of renovation and revitalization throughout their years of existence. The restoration was conducted throughout different periods and by different institutions or individuals. In this regard, the Sultan Mehmet Fatih Mosque was restored by [[Mehmet IV|Sultan Mehmet IV]] in the late 17th century, the Saint Nicholas Church with financial means of the European Union and the Jewish cemetery by university students.&lt;ref name=K.126/&gt;&lt;ref name=K.124/&gt;&lt;ref name=St.Nicola/&gt;&lt;ref name = ballkan.s/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Looking at Islamic Heritage in Kosovo|url=http://www.interfaithkosovo.org/blogs/366/looking-at-islamic-heritage-in-kosovo/?lang=En|publisher=The Interfaith Kosovo Team|date=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carshi Mosque|url=http://www.salatomatic.com/d/Kqic-i-Vogel+17085+Carshi-Mosque|publisher=salatomatic|location=Kqiç i Vogël|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the renovation of the Carshi Mosque was conducted by the Municipality of Pristina and its investment reached figures as high as half a million euros.&lt;ref name=K.press&gt;{{cite web|title=Mustafa, nga Hamami premton pamjen e vjetër të Prishtinës |url=http://www.kosovapress.com/sq/zgjedhjet-lokale-2013/mustafa-nga-hamami-premton-pamjen-e-vjeter-te-prishtines-3645/|publisher=KosovaPress|location=Prishtinë|language=Albanian|date=E diel, 06 Tetor 2013 13:40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Great Hammam ===
The process of the restoration of the Great Hammam initially began in 2007 and was initiated by the Municipality of Pristina and the Cultural Heritage without Borders office in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Nol. Binakaj.2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Binakaj|first=Nol|title=The Great Hammam in Prishtina|url=http://www.hdm.lth.se/fileadmin/hdm/alumni/papers/CMHB_2008_a/KOSOVO_Nol_Binakaj.pdf|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The total investment made in the restoration process is estimated to have been in the region of 700&amp;nbsp;thousand euros&lt;ref name="Nol. Binakaj.8"&gt;{{cite web|last=Binakaj|first=Nol|title=The Great Hammam in Prishtina|url=http://www.hdm.lth.se/fileadmin/hdm/alumni/papers/CMHB_2008_a/KOSOVO_Nol_Binakaj.pdf|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was divided into three phases. These consisted of investigation and assessment, structural restoration and attempts for re-functioning.&lt;ref name="Nol. Binakaj.6.7"&gt;{{cite web|last=Binakaj|first=Nol|title=The Great Hammam in Prishtina|url=http://www.hdm.lth.se/fileadmin/hdm/alumni/papers/CMHB_2008_a/KOSOVO_Nol_Binakaj.pdf|pages=6, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Hammam was inaugurated in October 2013, despite the fact that restoration was still undergoing at that time. There were attempts to open a museum showcasing neolithic artifacts from Pristina and the region and an arts gallery inside the hammam.&lt;ref name=K.press/&gt; However, the restoration process was met with controversy by some officials and governmental institutions of Kosovo. In this sense, the Ministry of Culture of Kosovo put a halt to the renovation process in February 2013 due to their questioning of the construction material used.&lt;ref name=j.k&gt;{{cite web|last=Selmani|first=Arbër|title=Gjashtë Vjet Punë S’e Kthejnë Hamamin|url=http://gazetajnk.com/?cid=1,964,5021|publisher=Gazeta "Jeta në Kosovë"|location=Prishtinë|language=Albanian|date=Mars 18, 201300:08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The works were restarted in May 2013 after a commission recommended that the material be replaced with a mixture that was closer to the authentic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vitija|first=Bujar|title=Restaurimi i Hamamit të vjetër do të nisë nga zero|url=http://www.gazetatribuna.com/?FaqeID=5&amp;LajmID=9935|publisher=Tribuna|language=Albanian|date=08:56 / E premte, 31 Maj 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, officials of the Kosovo Council for Cultural Heritage criticized the restoration by noting that the renovations during the period of 2009–2013 had damaged the monument. Gjejlane Hoxha, the executive director of this institution stated that the monument was in an improper situation and that its integrity and authenticity were threatened by the aftermaths of the uncontrolled activities of the restoration process and its conversion into a museum of Pristina. Moreover, she stated that if no specific action was to be undertaken to improve the image of this object, she would direct her concern to the [[Legal system of Kosovo|Prosecution of Kosovo]].&lt;ref name=j.k/&gt; She channeled her concern to the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports of Kosovo through a written statement, in which she expressed her unsettlement for the conservation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shkresë|url=http://mem.rks-gov.net/repository/docs/Hamami_i_Vjeter_ne_Prishtine_shkurt_2013__502966.pdf|location=Prishtinë|language=Albanian|date=2013-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, the entire restoration process was delayed several times; the entire process took over six years to be completed.&lt;ref name=j.k/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shengyl. Osmani"&gt;{{cite web|last=Osmani|first=Shengjyl|title=Restorers Wreak Havoc on Kosovo’s Old Hamam|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/restorers-wreak-havoc-on-kosovo-s-old-hamam|location=Pristina|date=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==
The boundaries of the old town of Pristina were judicially regulated by the Detailed Urban Plan in 1978 by the Institute of Urban Planning of the Municipality of Pristina. This covered an area of 8,2 ha and according to it, this was the only area in the city which consisted of culturally significant buildings and landmarks.&lt;ref name = coe.12&gt;{{cite web|title=CONSERVATION BASIS FOR THE "HISTORIC CENTRE" OF PRISHTINË|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/cooperation/kosovo/publications/20130129-PristinaCS.pdf|page=12|language=English, Albanian, Serbian|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KSI.8&gt;{{cite web|title=Një e ardhme për të kaluarën e Pishtinës|url=http://www.esiweb.org/pdf/esi_future_of_pristina%20booklet_albanian.pdf|publisher=Kosova Stability Initiative, European Stability Initiative|accessdate=23 February 2014|page=8|language=Albanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the area suffered from illegal constructions that sprang up after the period of the conflict in Kosovo and in order to address this issue, the authorities for urban planning of Pristina approved a strategic plan in 2004. Relying on the Law for Spatial Planning (no. 2003/4) and the Regulation on the Self-Governance of Kosovo Municipalities (no. 2000/45), in 2006 the Municipal Assembly of Pristina initiated a regulatory plan which defined boundaries that comprised an area of 26 ha. This was amended in 2009 by further adding new zones which came up to 42 ha. Moreover, the regulatory plan is expected to be further expanded and improved, as witnessed on the 2012 strategic plan of the Municipality of Pristina.&lt;ref name = coe.13.14&gt;{{cite web|title=CONSERVATION BASIS FOR THE "HISTORIC CENTRE" OF PRISHTINË|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/cooperation/kosovo/publications/20130129-PristinaCS.pdf|pages=13.14|language=English, Albanian, Serbian|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, individual monuments have been protected by law with various decisions and regulations, which were mostly approved in the 1950s and 1960s. The following table indicates the year of the adaptation of judicial means to preserve some of the historical monuments of Pristina:

{{expand German|Internationalismus (Sprache)|date=October 2013}}
In [[linguistics]], an '''internationalism''' or '''international word''' is a [[loanword]] that occurs in several languages (that is, [[translingualism|translingually]]) with the same or at least similar meaning and etymology. These words exist in "several different languages as a result of simultaneous or successive borrowings from the ultimate source" (I.V.Arnold){{Cite quote|date=May 2012}}. [[Pronunciation]] and [[orthography]] are similar so that the word is understandable between the different languages.

It is debated how many languages are required so that a word is an internationalism.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Furthermore, the languages required can also depend on the specific [[target language (translation)|target language]] at stake. For example, according to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], the most important languages that should include the same lexical item in order for it to qualify as an internationalism in [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]] are [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;Pages 187-188 in [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]], by Ghil'ad Zuckermann, [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is uncommon in [[English language|English]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}, although English has contributed a considerable number of words to world languages, e.g. the sport terms: ''[[football (soccer)|football]], [[baseball]], [[cricket]], and [[golf]]''.

==Origins==
European internationalisms originate primarily from [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]], but from other languages as well.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} However, due to [[English language|English]] being the main [[lingua franca]] of the [[Western world]], an increasing number of internationalisms originate from English. Many non-European words have also become international.

==Diffusion==
Internationalisms often spread together with the innovations they designate. Accordingly, there are [[semantic field]]s dominated by specific languages, e.g. the [[computing]] vocabulary which is mainly [[English language|English]] with internationalisms such as ''[[computer]]'', ''[[Disk storage|disk]]'', and ''[[Spam (electronic)|spam]]''. New inventions, political institutions, foodstuffs, leisure activities, science, and technological advances have all generated new [[lexemes]] and continue to do so: ''[[bionics]], [[cybernetics]], [[gene]], [[coffee]], [[chocolate]], etc''..

Some internationalisms are spread by speakers of one language living in geographical regions where other languages are spoken.  For example, some internationalisms coming from the English in India are ''[[bungalow]]'', ''[[jute]]'', ''[[khaki]]'', ''[[mango]]'', ''[[pyjamas]]'', and ''[[sari]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}&lt;!---Aren't these examples rather due to British trade? ---&gt;

==Use in constructed IALs==
{{See also|Interlingua}}

Due to their widespread use, internationalisms are often loaned into [[international auxiliary language]]s. Many [[Constructed language|constructed]] IALs borrow vocabulary that is already known by learners, so that they are as easy as possible to learn.

Internationalisms that occur in many languages are usually [[Interlingua and eligibility of international words|eligible to be included in Interlingua]]. Early internationalisms, such as those from French and German, tend to be part of [[Interlingua]]'s basic vocabulary. Later internationalisms, often from English, tend to be Interlingua loanwords. Among Asian languages, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] most often provides basic vocabulary, while [[Japanese language|Japanese]] contributes recent loanwords.

'''''It Happened at the World's Fair''''' is a 1963 American [[musical film]] starring [[Elvis Presley]] as a [[cropduster|cropdusting]] pilot. It was filmed in [[Seattle, Washington]], site of the ''[[Century 21 Exposition]]'', the 1962 [[World's Fair]]. The governor of Washington at the time, [[Albert Rosellini]], suggested the setting to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] executives. The film made $2.25 million at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Victor. ''The Elvis Encyclopedia''. Overlook, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Pilot Mike Edwards finds himself in a dilemma, his partner and friend Danny, gambles away the money Mike had set aside to pay their debts. Since they lost their money and a $1,200 debt, the local sheriff takes possession of their plane, Bessie, a [[Boeing-Stearman Model 75]] cropduster. If they cannot come up with the money in twelve days, Bessie will be auctioned off to the highest bidder.

Mike and Danny become reluctant hitchhikers, looking for a lift to anywhere. They are picked up by apple farmer Walter Ling and his niece Sue-Lin. They end up in Seattle, Washington, location of the 1962 World's Fair. When the uncle is called away on business, Danny persuades Mike to take Sue-Lin to tour the local World's Fair. It is during a visit to the doctor at the fair that Mike falls for Diane Warren, an attractive but stubborn nurse who resists Mike's advances. He gives a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] to a boy (a very young [[Kurt Russell]]) who kicks him in the shin, so that he can be treated by her. Diane's supervisor then convinces her to give Mike a ride back to his apartment, convinced his leg is injured. Mike and Diane dine at the top of the fair's Space Needle.  However, he also courts Dorothy Johnson.  

Complications then arise. Walter inexplicably fails to come back the next day to get Sue-Lin, leaving her with Mike. Sue-Lin feigns illness so that nurse Diane will come to their apartment and examine her and see Mike again. When Diane discovers that Mike has no kinship to Sue-Lin, she wants to inform the Welfare Board so that Sue-Lin can be removed from Mike and Danny's apartment. There is a mysterious nightfall plane delivery for Mike's and Danny's friend Vince, who is smuggling valuable furs. The film ends with Mike and Diane in love.

==Production==
The [[Seattle Center]], including the [[Seattle Center Monorail]] and the [[Space Needle]], serve as backdrops for several scenes in the film. Security officers pursue Presley and the girl through the fountains at what is now the [[Pacific Science Center]].  The hitchhiking scene with Elvis and Gary Lockwood was filmed near Camarillo, California, as were some of the flying scenes. The entire hitchhiking scene to the point where they are both picked up by Kam Tong and Vicky Tiu Cayetano in the truck is easily recognizable as 5th Street near Pleasant Valley Road on the South side of Camarillo.&lt;ref&gt;Victor 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While ''The Elvis Encyclopedia'' believes that the [[Wilburton Trestle]] was shown in the movie, further evidence points to a different location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usacitiesonline.com/wacountybuckley.htm/ Key to the City's profile of Buckley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908051350/http://www.usacitiesonline.com/wacountybuckley.htm |date=2011-09-08 }} ''The history blurb on this page was written before the trestle was demolished.''&lt;/ref&gt; It is actually a trestle over the [[White River (Washington)|White River]] between [[Enumclaw, Washington|Enumclaw]] and [[Buckley, Washington|Buckley]], now demolished.  The view in the movie was taken at the intersection of Mud Mountain Road and Highway 410, looking southeasterly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Southeast+Mud+Mountain+Road,+Enumclaw,+WA+%26+highway+410&amp;layer=c&amp;sll=47.176883,-122.019813&amp;cbp=13,134.24,,0,-0.35&amp;cbll=47.176873,-122.019787&amp;hl=en&amp;sspn=0.006295,0.006295&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Washington+410+%26+SE+Mud+Mountain+Rd,+Enumclaw+Plateau,+King,+Washington+98022&amp;ll=47.176448,-122.019171&amp;spn=0.004091,0.009645&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;panoid=kfbxD-uQanZgLRZ3Wor-tQ/ Google Street View of Mud Mountain Road and Highway 410] ''You can still see the bend in the road and a guard rail in the same place as in the movie''&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Mount Rainier]] is visible in the background, which isn't seen at that angle from the Wilburton Trestle.  The Wilburton Trestle is actually bigger than the White River Trestle, at six sections high.  The trestle pictured in the movie is only four sections high at the road crossing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrvmuseum.org/journal/journal_0102.htm/ White River Journal, January 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927091445/http://www.wrvmuseum.org/journal/journal_0102.htm |date=2011-09-27 }} White River History Museum.

==Reception==
Eugene Archer of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Elvis Presley's budding dramatic talents have been neatly nipped in the Seattle story, which emerges as a dismal parody of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musicals of old. Burdened with a dozen tuneless songs and a plot requiring him to play guardian to a mercilessly cute Chinese waif, the crooner merely swivels ingenuously through a morass of clichés."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Archer |first=Eugene |date=May 30, 1963 |title=Presley and Reeves in Double Bill at Neighborhood Theaters |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that "this is apt to be tedious going for all but the most confirmed of Presley's young admirers. The 10-count-'em-10 tunes he sings may be cause for rejoicing among his more ardent followers but, stacked up proportionately against the skinny story in between, it seems at least three too many ... so many warbling interruptions upset the tempo of the yarn and prevent plot and picture from gathering momentum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 3, 1963 |title=It Happened At The World's Fair |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page= 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; John L. Scott of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that "it must be said that unless you're a Presley fan, the 10 songs he offers while plinking a guitar or ukulele can grow tedious, while the frivolous backgrounding story is turned on and off between tunes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=John L. |date=April 6, 1963 |title=Songathon Stars Elvis |journal=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=Part III p. 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Home media==
The film was released to DVD by Warner Home Video on August 7, 2007 as a Region 1 Widescreen DVD.

==Notes==

The '''Kamëntsá''' are an [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] of [[Colombia]]. They primarily live in the [[Sibundoy Valley]] of the [[Putumayo Department]] in the south of Colombia.&lt;ref name=foot&gt;[http://www.footprinttravelguides.com/latin-america/colombia/culture/arts-and-crafts/ "Arts and Crafts in Colombia."] ''Footprint Travel Guides.'' Accessed 29 Jan 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The Kamëntsá also are known as the Camsá, Camëntsëá, Coche, Kamemtxa, Kamsa, Kamse, Sibundoy, and Sibundoy-Gaché people.&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;

==Language==
The [[Camsá language]] is a [[language isolate]],&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt; although linguists have tried to connect it to the [[Chibchan language]] family in the past. The language is written in the [[Latin script]].&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt; 

==Culture==
They are known for their carved wooden masks that are worn during ceremonies and festivals.&lt;ref name=foot/&gt; They farm maize, beans, potatoes, and peas, and use a number of different [[entheogen]]s, including [[ayahuasca]] (yagé), ''[[Brugmansia]]'' species, ''[[Iochroma fuchsioides]]'' and ''[[Desfontainia]]'' in their rituals. Kamëntsá [[shaman]]s are noted for the number and variety of ''Brugmansia'' cultivars which they have propagated in their gardens of entheogenic plants, and which bear leaves in a wide variety of curiously misshapen forms. One of these cultivars - 'Culebra' ('snake' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) proved so aberrant that it was, for a time,  actually removed from ''Brugmansia'' and accorded monotypic genus status as Methysticodendron (Greek : 'intoxicating tree'), the full Linnaean binomial of the plant becoming ''Methysticodendron amesianum'' before it was subsumed once more in ''Brugmansia''.&lt;ref&gt; Schultes, Richard Evans; Hofmann, Albert (1979).

'''Litigation public relations''' is the management of the [[Public relations|communication process]] during the course of any [[Legal case|legal dispute]] or [[Adjudication|adjudicatory]] processing so as to affect the outcome or its impact on the client’s overall [[reputation]] (Haggerty, 2003).

==Background==

[[Plaintiff]]s and [[prosecutor]]s have long used mass media to get their side of the story out to the public, but the formal practice of litigation PR, a sub-specialty of crisis communication, first emerged in the early 1980s with [[Alan Hilburg]], a pioneer in litigation communications representation of [[Tobacco industry|U.S. Tobacco]] in the [[Marsee case]]. Since then, the need for litigation PR has grown tremendously as media coverage of court cases and the law has increased. Most parties to a lawsuit have important interests that expand beyond legal concerns. Negative publicity about a litigant can cause damage to an individuals reputation that a courtroom win years later may not salvage. Thus, parties to cases, whether civil or criminal, can not ignore the impact of negative publicity on public opinion (Reber, Gower, &amp; Robinson, 2006).

==Definition of Litigation PR==

'''Litigation PR''' is the management of the communication process prior to and during the course of any legal dispute or adjudicatory processing so as to affect the outcome or its impact on the client’s overall reputation (Haggerty, 2003).

'''Basic Concepts of Litigation Public Relations—'''

'''The First Concept—''''''Litigation PR''' is to influence the outcome of the court case by encouraging early or favorable settlement or by pressuring the prosecution into bringing lesser or no charges (Haggerty, 2003).

'''The Second Concept—''''''Litigation PR''' is to protect the client’s reputation before and during the trial. In this regard, litigation PR is akin to reputation management. Reputation management is about managing public perception of an organization or individual. It is about attitude toward the individual and not knowledge itself. An essential aspect of reputation management is influencing attitude about the individual and corporation, which can encourage positive activation to the benefit of the organization (Haywood, 2002).

==Litigation PR and Media Coverage==

Litigation PR on the part of [[defendant]]s is needed, especially in high-profile cases because the media have an inherent bias in favor of plaintiffs and prosecutors. When allegations are made public, the media tend to cast the lawsuit in terms of victim versus villain. News stories frequently lead with the plaintiff or prosecutors’ allegations. If the defendant’s responses are included at all, they appear well into the story. Thus, the defendant is forced on the defensive from the outset. In such situation, “working with the media to create more balanced, accurate, and less sensational coverage of a lawsuit is necessary element in defending high profile defendants" (Hantler, Schwartz, &amp; Goldberg, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;8).

==Fitzpatrick’s Six Objectives of Litigation Public Relations==

# Counteracting negative publicity. 
# Making a client’s viewpoint known.
# Ensuring balanced media coverage.
# Helping the media and the public understand complex legal issues.
# Defusing a hostile environment.
# Helping resolve the conflict (Fitzpatrick, 1996).

To achieve those objectives, the first step is to establish credibility with the media as an information source. The next step is to control the flow of information to the media so that the right message gets out. The third step is to develop a message that supports the client’s position and get that message out to the media and the public (Fitzpatrick, 1996, Haggerty, 2003, Reber, Gower, &amp; Robinson, 2006).

==Differences between Litigation PR and Other PR Practices==

*Litigation PR is highly dependent on the media. Although the practice of PR involves far more than just mediated communication, litigation PR remains dependent on the media. It is because of the media’s increased attention to lawsuits that litigation PR has become a necessity for many high-profile clients (Gibson, 1998).
*Because typical public relations campaign strategies and tactics may not be appropriate and may even be harmful at certain times during a lawsuit, the legal strategy must take procedure (Schweitzer, 2003). 
*Litigation PR is more regulated than regular public relations because of the potential to prejudice the legal process (Gibson, 1998).
*Litigation PR is directed with the emphasis of one-way, asymmetrical communication. Because the law is adversarial in nature, creating a win-lose situation, the goal of litigation PR is to reinforce the legal strategy and theory of the case to ensure a win and to reduce damage to the organization’s credibility and reputation (Reber, Gower, &amp; Robinson, 2006).

{{More citations needed|date=November 2010}}

A '''lowrider''' (sometimes '''low rider''') is a class or style of customized vehicle. Distinct from a regular lowered vehicle, these [[Custom car|customized vehicles]] are generally individually painted with intricate, colorful designs, rolling on wire-spoke wheels with whitewall tires. Lowrider rims range from 13"-20".  They are also fitted with hydraulic or air bag systems that allow the vehicle to be raised or lowered at the owner's command. Given these specific characteristics, while a lowrider is always a lowered car, a lowered car is not always a lowrider. The term is used to describe a class of vehicle, not simply the height from ground to chassis.

The term ''lowrider'' can also refer to the driver of the car.

==History==
[[File:Downtown San Jose Lowrider.jpg|thumb|right|Early '60s [[Chevrolet Impala]] lowrider in [[San Jose, CA]]]]
It began in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] in the mid-to-late 1940s and during the [[Post–World War II economic expansion|post-war prosperity of the 1950s]]. Initially, some [[Mexican-American]] barrio youths lowered blocks, cut spring coils, z’ed the frames and dropped spindles. The aim of the lowriders is to cruise as slowly as possible, "Low and Slow" being their motto. By redesigning these cars in ways that go against their intended purposes and in painting their cars so that they reflect and hold meanings from Mexican culture, lowriders create cultural and political statements that go against the more prevalent [[Anglo-America|Anglo]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Sturken &amp; Cartwright| first= Marita &amp; Lisa| title= Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture| year= 2009| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-531440-3| page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the cars encouraged a "bi-focal perspective-they are made to be watched but only after adjustments have been made to provide ironic and playful commentary on prevailing standard of automobile design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Lipsitz| first= George| title= The Subcultures Reader: Cruising around the Historical Bloc| year= 1997| publisher= Routledge| location= New York| page= 358}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this resulted in a backlash: the enactment of Section 24008 of the [[California Vehicle Code]] in January 1, 1958, which made it illegal to operate any car modified so that any part was lower than the bottoms of its wheel rims.

In 1959, a customizer named Ron Aguirre developed a way of bypassing the law with the use of [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] Pesco pumps and valves that allowed him to [[Height adjustable suspension|change ride height]] at the flick of a switch.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The following year saw the emergence of the [[Chevrolet Impala]], which featured an X-shaped frame that was perfectly suited for lowering and modification with hydraulics.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Between 1960 and 1975, customizers adapted and refined GM X-frames, hydraulics, and [[airbrushing]] techniques to create the modern lowrider style.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In the 1990s, lowriders became strongly associated with [[West Coast Hip hop]] and [[G-Funk]] culture. [[Dr. Dre]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Warren G]], [[South Central Cartel]], [[Eazy-E]] and [[Above the Law (group)|Above the Law]] among others featured lowriders prominently in their music videos.

Today, the lowriding scene is diverse with many different participating cultures, vehicle makes, and visual styles. At first, lowriders were only seen in places like LA, especially back in the 1970s on Whittier Boulevard when lowriding came to its peak. Whittier was a wide commercial street that cut through the barrio of the city in Los Angeles, California. On Saturday nights, young Mexican Americans went cruising along Whittier in their lowriders. Lowriders nowadays have gotten fairly popular: lowriders can be seen all over the country from coast to coast, but recently they have been spreading to other places around the world. Lowriding culture has also spread to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;DELGADILLO , NATALIE. “Meet the Chicanos of Japan.” Google, Google, 2 Feb. 2017, www.google.com/amp/s/www.citylab.com/amp/article/515388/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frost|first1=Bob|title=History of Lowriders|url=http://www.historyaccess.com/historyoflowride.html|website=www.historyaccess.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.convictedartist.com/lowrider_history.html ''Lowrider History'']; convictedartist.com; retrieved on 2010-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TheMeltingpot1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The image of the United States as a melting pot was popularized by the 1908 play ''[[The Melting Pot (play)|The Melting Pot]]''.]]

The '''melting pot''' is a [[Monoculturalism|monocultural]] metaphor for a [[wiktionary:heterogeneous|heterogeneous]] society becoming more [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogeneous]], the different elements "melting together" into a harmonious whole with a common culture or vice versa, for a homogeneous society becoming more [[wiktionary:heterogeneous|heterogeneous]] through the influx of foreign elements with different cultural background with a potential creation of disharmony with the previous culture.

==Origins of the term==
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the metaphor of a "[[crucible]]" or "smelting pot" was used to describe the fusion of different nationalities, ethnicities and cultures. It was used together with concepts of the United States as an ideal [[Republicanism|republic]] and a "[[city upon a hill]]" or new [[promised land]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It was a metaphor for the idealized process of [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] and [[Colonization of the Americas|colonization]] by which different nationalities, cultures and "races" (a term that could encompass nationality, ethnicity and race proper) were to blend into a new, virtuous community, and it was connected to [[utopian]] visions of the emergence of an American "[[New Man (utopian concept)|new man]]". While "melting" was in common use the exact term "melting pot" came into general usage in 1908, after the premiere of the play ''[[The Melting Pot (play)|The Melting Pot]]'' by [[Israel Zangwill]].

The first use in American literature of the concept of immigrants "melting" into the receiving culture are found in the writings of [[J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur]]. In his ''[[Letters from an American Farmer]]'' (1782) Crevecoeur writes, in response to his own question, "What then is the American, this new man?" that the American is one who "leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced, the government he obeys, and the new rank he holds.  He becomes an American by being received in the broad lap of our great [[Alma Mater]].  Here individuals of all nations are ''melted'' into a new race of men, whose labors and posterity will one day cause great changes in the world."

{{quote|...whence came all these people? They are a mixture of English, Scotch, Irish, French, Dutch, Germans, and Swedes... What, then, is the American, this new man? He is either an European or the descendant of an European; hence that strange mixture of blood, which you will find in no other country. I could point out to you a family whose grandfather was an Englishman, whose wife was Dutch, whose son married a French woman, and whose present four sons have now four wives of different nations. He is an American, who, leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced, the new government he obeys, and the new rank he holds.... The Americans were once scattered all over Europe; here they are incorporated into one of the finest systems of population which has ever appeared.
|J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur, ''Letters from an American Farmer''}}

In 1845, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], alluding to the development of European civilization out of the medieval [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], wrote in his private journal of America as the Utopian product of a culturally and racially mixed "[[smelting]] pot", but only in 1912 were his remarks first published. In his writing, Emerson explicitly welcomed the racial intermixing of whites and non-whites, a highly controversial view during his lifetime.

A magazine article in 1876 used the metaphor explicitly:

{{quote|The fusing process goes on as in a [[Blast furnace|blast-furnace]]; one generation, a single year even—transforms the English, the German, the Irish emigrant into an American. Uniform institutions, ideas, language, the influence of the majority, bring us soon to a similar complexion; the individuality of the immigrant, almost even his traits of race and religion, fuse down in the democratic alembic like chips of brass thrown into the melting pot.&lt;ref&gt;Titus Munson Coan, "A New Country", ''The Galaxy'' Volume 0019, Issue 4 (April 1875), p. 463 [http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=gala&amp;cc=gala&amp;xc=1&amp;idno=gala0019-4&amp;g=moagrp&amp;q1=melting+pot&amp;node=gala0019-4%3A3&amp;frm=frameset&amp;view=image&amp;seq=465 online]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1893, historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] also used the metaphor of immigrants melting into one American culture. In his essay ''[[The Significance of the Frontier in American History]]'', he referred to the "composite nationality" of the American people, arguing that the [[frontier]] had functioned as a "[[crucible]]" where "the immigrants were Americanized, liberated and fused into a mixed race, English in neither nationality nor characteristics".

In his 1905 travel narrative ''[[The American Scene]]'', [[Henry James]] discusses cultural intermixing in New York City as a "fusion, as of elements in solution in a vast hot pot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Henry|title=The American Scene|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|year=1968|isbn=0861550188}}, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact term "melting pot" came into general usage in the United States after it was used as a metaphor describing a fusion of nationalities, cultures and ethnicities in the 1908 [[The Melting Pot (play)|play of the same name]], first performed in [[Washington, D.C.]], where the immigrant protagonist declared: {{quote|Understand that America is God's Crucible, the great Melting-Pot where all the races of Europe are melting and re-forming! Here you stand, good folk, think I, when I see them at Ellis Island, here you stand in your fifty groups, your fifty languages, and histories, and your fifty blood hatreds and rivalries. But you won't be long like that, brothers, for these are the fires of God you've come to—these are fires of God. A fig for your feuds and vendettas! Germans and Frenchmen, Irishmen and Englishmen, Jews and Russians—into the Crucible with you all! God is making the American.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in [[Gary Gerstle]] ''American Crucible; Race and Nation in the Twentieth Century,'' Princeton University Press, 2001, p. 51. Hirschman, C. "America's Melting Pot Policy Reconsidered", ''Annual Review of Sociology'', 9, 1983, 397–423 (p. 397).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

; Israel Zangwill
In ''The Melting Pot'' (1908), Israel Zangwill combined a romantic denouement with an utopian celebration of complete cultural intermixing. The play was an adaptation of William Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', set in New York City. The play's immigrant protagonist David Quixano, a Russian Jew, falls in love with Vera, a fellow Russian immigrant who is Christian. Vera is an idealistic [[settlement house]] worker and David is a composer struggling to create an "American symphony" to celebrate his adopted homeland. Together they manage to overcome the old world animosities that threaten to separate them. But then David discovers that Vera is the daughter of the Tsarist officer who directed the [[pogrom]] that forced him to flee Russia. Horrified, he breaks up with her, betraying his belief in the possibility of transcending religious and ethnic animosities. However, unlike Shakespeare's tragedy,  there is a happy ending. At the end of the play the lovers are reconciled.

Reunited with Vera and watching the setting sun gilding the [[Statue of Liberty]], David Quixano has a prophetic vision: "It is the Fires of God round His Crucible. There she lies, the great Melting-Pot—Listen! Can't you hear the roaring and the bubbling? There gapes her mouth, the harbor where a thousand mammoth feeders come from the ends of the world to pour in their human freight". David foresees how the American melting pot will make the nation's immigrants transcend their old animosities and differences and will fuse them into one people: "Here shall they all unite to build the Republic of Man and the Kingdom of God. Ah, Vera, what is the glory of Rome and Jerusalem where all nations and races come to worship and look back, compared with the glory of America, where all
races and nations come to labour and look forward!"

Zangwill thus combined the metaphor of the "crucible" or "melting pot" with a celebration of the United States as an ideal republic and a new promised land. The prophetic words of his Jewish protagonist against the backdrop of the Statue of Liberty allude to [[Emma Lazarus]]'s famous poem ''[[The New Colossus]]'' (1883), which celebrated the statue as a symbol of American democracy and its identity as an immigrant nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/destinationamerica/usim_qz1b.html|title=Take the Quiz|date=September 2005|work=Destination America|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zangwill concludes his play by wishing, "Peace, peace, to all ye unborn millions, fated to fill this giant continent—the God of our children give you Peace." Expressing his hope that through this forging process the "unborn millions" who would become America's future citizens would become a unified nation at peace with itself despite its ethnic and religious diversity.

==United States==
In terms of [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants to the United States]], the "melting pot" process has been equated with [[Americanization (immigration)|Americanization]], that is, [[cultural assimilation]] and [[acculturation]]. The "melting pot" metaphor implies both a melting of cultures and intermarriage of [[ethnicities]], yet cultural assimilation or acculturation can also occur without intermarriage. Thus African-Americans are fully culturally integrated into American culture and institutions. Yet more than a century after the abolition of slavery, intermarriage between African-Americans and other ethnicities is much less common than between different white ethnicities, or between white and Asian ethnicities. Intermarriage between whites and non-whites, and especially African-Americans, was a taboo in the United States for a long time, and was illegal in many US states (see [[anti-miscegenation laws]]) until 1967.&lt;ref name="Hollinger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollinger|first=David A.|date=December 2003|title=Amalgamation and Hypodescent: The Question of Ethnoracial Mixture in the History of the United States|journal=The American Historical Review|publisher=Indiana University|volume=108|issue=5|pages=1363–90|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/108.5/hollinger.html|accessdate=2008-07-15|doi=10.1086/529971|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802031739/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/108.5/hollinger.html|archivedate=2012-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whiteness and the melting pot in the United States===
The melting pot theory of ethnic relations, which sees American identity as centered upon the acculturation or assimilation and the intermarriage of white immigrant groups, has been analyzed by the emerging academic field of [[whiteness studies]]. This discipline examines the "[[social construction]] of whiteness" and highlights the changing ways in which whiteness has been normative to American national identity from the 17th to the 20th century.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, European [[immigration]] to the United States became increasingly diverse and increased substantially in numbers. Beginning in the 1890s, large numbers of Southern and Eastern European immigrant groups such as the [[Italian Americans|Italians]], [[American Jew|Jews]], and [[Polish Americans|Poles]] arrived. Many returned to Europe but those who remained merged into the cultural melting pot, adopting American lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Archdeacon, ''Becoming American'' (1984) pp. 112–25&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Chinese arrivals met intense hostility and  [[Chinese Exclusion Act|new laws in the 1880s]] tried to exclude them, but many arrived illegally. Hostility forced them into "Chinatowns" or ethnic enclaves in the larger cities, where they lived a culture apart and seldom assimilated. The acquisition of Hawaii in 1898, with full citizenship for the residents of all races, greatly increased the Asian American population.

In the early 20th century, the meaning of the recently popularized concept of the melting pot was subject to ongoing debate which centered on the issue of immigration. The debate surrounding the concept of the melting pot centered on how immigration impacted American society and on how immigrants should be approached. The melting pot was equated with either the acculturation or the total assimilation of European immigrants, and the debate centered on the differences between these two ways of approaching immigration: "Was the idea to melt down the immigrants and then pour the resulting, formless liquid into the preexisting cultural and social molds modeled on Anglo-Protestants like [[Henry Ford]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]], or was the idea instead that everyone, ''[[Mayflower]]'' descendants and Sicilians, [[Ashkenazi]] and Slovaks, would act chemically upon each other so that all would be changed, and a new compound would emerge?"&lt;ref name="Hollinger" /&gt;

[[Nativists]] wanted to severely restrict access to the melting pot. They felt that far too many "undesirables," or in their view, culturally inferior immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe had already arrived. The compromises that were reached in a series of immigration laws in the 1920s established the principle that the number of new arrivals should be small, and, apart from family reunification, the inflow of new immigrants should match the ethnic profile of the nation as it existed at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Higham (1955) {{page?|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; National quotas were established that discouraged immigration from Poland, Italy and Russia, and encouraged immigration from Britain, Ireland and Germany.

====Native Americans====
Intermarriage between Euro-American men and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] women has been common since colonial days. In the 21st century some 7.5 million Americans claim Native American ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Matthew Snipp|title=American Indians: The First of this Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E0CsvVoVA90C&amp;pg=PA53|year=1989|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|page=53|isbn=978-1610445092}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1920s the nation welcomed celebrities of Native American background, especially [[Will Rogers]] and [[Jim Thorpe]], as well as Vice President [[Charles Curtis]], who had been brought up on a reservation and identified with his Indian heritage.

====Miscegenation====
The mixing of whites and blacks, resulting in multiracial children, for which the term "[[miscegenation]]" was coined in 1863, was a taboo, and most whites opposed marriages between whites and blacks. In many states, marriage between whites and non-whites was even prohibited by [[state law]] through [[anti-miscegenation laws]]. As a result, two kinds of "mixture talk" developed:

As the new word—miscegenation—became associated with black-white mixing, a preoccupation of the years after the Civil War, the residual European immigrant aspect of the question of [ethnoracial mixture] came to be more than ever a thing apart, discussed all the more easily without any reference to the African-American aspect of the question. This separation of mixture talk into two discourses facilitated, and was in turn reinforced by, the process [[Matthew Frye Jacobson]] has detailed whereby European immigrant groups became less ambiguously white and more definitely "not black".&lt;ref name="Hollinger" /&gt;}}

By the early 21st century, many white Americans celebrated the impact of African-American culture, especially in sports and music. Marriages between white Americans and African-Americans were still problematic in both communities. Israel Zangwill saw this coming in the early 20th century: "However scrupulously and justifiably America avoids intermarriage with the negro, the comic spirit cannot fail to note spiritual miscegenation which, while clothing, commercializing, and Christianizing the ex-African, has given '[[rag-time]]' and the sex-dances that go with it, first to white America and then to the whole white world."&lt;ref name="Rogin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogin|first=Michael|date=December 1992|title=Making America Home: Racial Masquerade and Ethnic Assimilation in the Transition to Talking Pictures|journal=The Journal of American History|publisher=Organization of American Historians|volume=79|issue=3|pages=1050–77|accessdate=2011-05-14|doi=10.2307/2080798|jstor=2080798|url=http://www.library.eiu.edu/ersvdocs/4455.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807164904/http://www.library.eiu.edu/ersvdocs/4455.pdf|archivedate=2011-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiracial influences on culture===
White Americans long regarded some elements of [[African-American culture]] quintessentially "American", while at the same time treating African Americans as second-class citizens. White appropriation, stereotyping and mimicking of black culture played an important role in the construction of an urban popular culture in which European immigrants could express themselves as Americans, through such traditions as [[blackface]], [[minstrel show]]s and later in [[jazz]] and in early Hollywood cinema, notably in ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927).&lt;ref name="Rogin"/&gt;

Analyzing the "racial masquerade" that was involved in creation of a white "melting pot" culture through the stereotyping and imitation of black and other non-white cultures in the early 20th century, historian Michael Rogin has commented: "Repudiating 1920s nativism, these films [Rogin discusses ''The Jazz Singer'', ''[[Old San Francisco]]'' (1927), ''[[Whoopee! (film)|Whoopee!]]'' (1930), ''[[King of Jazz]]'' (1930) celebrate the melting pot. Unlike other racially stigmatized groups, white immigrants can put on and take off their mask of difference. But the freedom promised immigrants to make themselves over points to the vacancy, the violence, the deception, and the melancholy at the core of American self-fashioning".&lt;ref name="Rogin"/&gt;

Since World War II, the idea of the melting pot has become more racially inclusive in the United States, gradually extending also to acceptance of marriage between whites and non-whites.

====Ethnicity in films====
This trend towards greater acceptance of ethnic and racial minorities was evident in popular culture in the combat films of World War II, starting with [[Bataan (film)|''Bataan'']] (1943). This film celebrated solidarity and cooperation between Americans of all races and ethnicities through the depiction of a multiracial American unit. At the time blacks and Japanese in the armed forces were still segregated, while Chinese and Indians were in integrated units.

Historian [[Richard Slotkin]] sees ''Bataan'' and the combat genre that sprang from it as the source of the "melting pot platoon", a cinematic and cultural convention symbolizing in the 1940s "an American community that did not yet exist", and thus presenting an implicit protest against racial segregation. However, Slotkin points out that ethnic and racial harmony within this platoon is predicated upon racist hatred for the Japanese enemy: "the emotion which enables the platoon to transcend racial prejudice is itself a virulent expression of racial hatred...The final heat which blends the ingredients of the melting pot is rage against an enemy which is fully dehumanized as a race of 'dirty monkeys.'" He sees this racist rage as an expression of "the unresolved tension between racialism and civic egalitarianism in American life".&lt;ref name="Slotkin"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/alh/13.3.469|last=Slotkin|first=Richard |date=Fall 2001|title=Unit Pride: Ethnic Platoons and the Myths of American Nationality|journal=American Literary History|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|volume=13|issue=9|pages=469–98|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/american_literary_history/v013/13.3slotkin.html|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hawaii====
In Hawaii, as Rohrer (2008) argues, there are two dominant discourses of racial politics, both focused on "[[haole]]" (white people or whiteness in Hawaii) in the islands. The first is the discourse of racial harmony representing Hawaii as an idyllic racial paradise with no conflict or inequality. There is also a competing discourse of discrimination against nonlocals, which contends that "haoles" and nonlocal people of color are disrespected and treated unfairly in Hawaii. As negative referents for each other, these discourses work to reinforce one another and are historically linked. Rohrer proposes that the question of racial politics be reframed toward consideration of the processes of racialization themselves—toward a new way of thinking about racial politics in Hawaii that breaks free of the not racist/racist dyad.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Rohrer, "Disrupting the 'Melting Pot': Racial Discourse in Hawai'i and the Naturalization of Haole." ''Ethnic and Racial Studies'' 2008 31(6): 1110–25&lt;/ref&gt;

====Olympics====
Throughout the history of the modern Olympic Games, the theme of the United States as a melting pot has been employed to explain American athletic success, becoming an important aspect of national self-image. The diversity of American athletes in the Olympic Games in the early 20th century was an important avenue for the country to redefine a national culture amid a massive influx of immigrants, as well as American Indians (represented by [[Jim Thorpe]] in 1912) and blacks (represented by [[Jesse Owens]] in 1936). In the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]], two black American athletes with gold and bronze medals saluted the U.S. national anthem with [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|a "Black Power" salute]] that symbolized rejection of assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Louis Gates and Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham (2004). ''African American lives''. p. 5 {{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international aspect of the games allowed the United States to define its pluralistic self-image against the monolithic traditions of other nations. American athletes served as cultural ambassadors of [[American exceptionalism]], promoting the melting pot ideology and the image of America as a progressive nation based on middle-class culture. Journalists and other American analysts of the Olympics framed their comments with patriotic nationalism, stressing that the success of U.S. athletes, especially in the high-profile track-and-field events, stemmed not from simple athletic prowess but from the superiority of the civilization that spawned them.

Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Games]] in [[Salt Lake City]] strongly revived the melting pot image, returning to a bedrock form of American nationalism and patriotism. The reemergence of Olympic melting pot discourse was driven especially by the unprecedented success of [[African Americans]], [[Mexican Americans]], [[Asian Americans]], and [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]] in events traditionally associated with Europeans and white North Americans such as speed skating and the bobsled.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dyerson, "'America's Athletic Missionaries': Political Performance, Olympic Spectacle and the Quest for an American National Culture, 1896–1912," ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 2008 25(2): 185–203; Dyerson, "Return to the Melting Pot: An Old American Olympic Story,"  ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 2008 25(2): 204–23&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 Winter Olympics was also a showcase of American religious freedom and cultural tolerance of the history of Utah's large majority population of [[Mormons]], as well representation of [[Muslim Americans]] and other religious groups in the U.S. Olympic team.&lt;ref&gt;Ethan R.

==Melting pot and cultural pluralism==
The concept of [[multiculturalism]] was preceded by the concept of [[cultural pluralism]], which was first developed in the 1910s and 1920s, and became widely popular during the 1940s. The concept of cultural pluralism first emerged in the 1910s and 1920s among intellectual circles out of the debates in the United States over how to approach issues of immigration and national identity.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The [[First World War]] heightened tensions between Anglo-American and German-Americans. The war and the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], which caused a "[[Red Scare]]" in the US, which also fanned feelings of [[xenophobia]]. During and immediately after the First World War, the concept of the melting pot was equated by [[Nativists]] with complete cultural assimilation towards an Anglo-American norm ("Anglo-conformity") on the part of immigrants, and immigrants who opposed such assimilation were accused of disloyalty to the United States.

The newly popularized concept of the melting pot was frequently equated with "Americanization", meaning cultural assimilation, by many "old stock" Americans. In [[Henry Ford]]'s Ford English School (established in 1914), the graduation ceremony for immigrant employees involved symbolically stepping off an immigrant ship and passing through ''the melting pot'', entering at one end in costumes designating their nationality and emerging at the other end in identical suits and waving American flags.&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Labor/L_Overview/FordEnglishSchool.htm|title=Ford English School|work=Automobile in American Life and Society|publisher=University of Michigan |location=Dearborn|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univ-nancy2.fr/UFRLCE/DepAnglais/cours/civi/immigration.html|title=Immigration|publisher=University of Nancy|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the absorption of million of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe was especially strong among such popular writers [[Madison Grant]] and [[Lothrop Stoddard]], who believed in the "racial" superiority of Americans of Northern European descent as member of the "[[Nordicism|Nordic race]]", and therefore demanded immigration restrictions to stop a "degeneration" of America's white racial "stock". They believed that complete cultural assimilation of the immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe was not a solution to the problem of immigration because intermarriage with these immigrants would endanger the [[racial purity]] of Anglo-America. The controversy over immigration faded away after immigration restrictions were put in place with the enactment of the [[Johnson-Reed Act]] in 1924.

In response to the pressure exerted on immigrants to culturally assimilate and also as a reaction against the denigration of the culture of non-Anglo white immigrants by Nativists, intellectuals on the left such as [[Horace Kallen]], in ''Democracy Versus the Melting-Pot'' (1915), and [[Randolph Bourne]], in ''Trans-National America'' (1916), laid the foundations for the concept of [[cultural pluralism]]. This term was coined by Kallen.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Pianko,  "'The True Liberalism of Zionism': Horace Kallen, Jewish Nationalism, and the Limits of American Pluralism," ''American Jewish History,'' December 2008, Vol. 94, Issue 4, pp. 299–329,&lt;/ref&gt; Randolph Bourne, who objected to Kallen's emphasis on the inherent value of ethnic and cultural difference, envisioned a "trans-national" and [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] America. The concept of cultural pluralism was popularized in the 1940s by [[John Dewey]].

In the United States, where the term melting pot is still commonly used, the ideas of [[cultural pluralism]] and [[multiculturalism]] have, in some circles, taken precedence over the idea of assimilation.&lt;ref name="Miton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Milton |first=Gordon |title=Assimilation in American Life |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1964|isbn=0195008960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dealing with Diversity"&gt;{{cite book | last =Adams  | first =J.Q.  | authorlink =  |author2=Strother-Adams, Pearlie | year =2001  | title =Dealing with Diversity  | publisher =Kendall/Hunt Publishing Co | location =Chicago | isbn = 078728145X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glazer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glazer |first=Nathan |author2=Moynihan, Daniel P.|title=Beyond the Melting Pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians and Irish of New York City|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|year=1970|edition=2nd|isbn=026257022X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternate models where immigrants retain their native cultures such as the "salad bowl"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsavvy.com/understanding_american_culture.htm|title=Understanding American Culture: From Melting Pot to Salad Bowl|last=Millet|first=Joyce |publisher=Cultural Savvy|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "symphony"&lt;ref name="Miton" /&gt; are more often used by sociologists to describe how cultures and ethnicities mix in the United States. Nonetheless, the term assimilation is still used to describe the ways in which immigrants and their descendants adapt, such as by increasingly using the national language of the host society as their first language.

Since the 1960s, much research in Sociology and History has disregarded the melting pot theory for describing interethnic relations in the United States and other counties.&lt;ref name="Miton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dealing with Diversity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; The theory of [[multiculturalism]] offers alternative analogies for ethnic interaction including ''[[salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]] theory'', or, as it is known in [[Canada]], the ''[[cultural mosaic]]''. In the 1990s, [[political correctness]] in the United States emphasized that each ethnic and national group has the right to maintain and preserve its cultural distinction and integrity, and that one does not need to assimilate or abandon one's heritage in order to blend in or merge into the majority Anglo-American society.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Nevertheless, some prominent scholars, such as [[Samuel P. Huntington]] in ''[[Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity]]'', have expressed the view that the most accurate explanation for modern-day United States culture and inter-ethnic relations can be found somewhere in a fusion of some of the concepts and ideas contained in the melting pot, assimilation, and Anglo-conformity models. Under this theory, it is asserted that the United States has one of the most homogeneous cultures of any nation in the world. This line of thought holds that this American national culture derived most of its traits and characteristics from early colonial settlers from Britain, Ireland, and Germany. When more recent immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe brought their various cultures to America at the beginning of the 20th century, they changed the American cultural landscape just very slightly, and, for the most part, assimilated into America's pre-existing culture which had its origins in Northwestern Europe.

The decision of whether to support a melting-pot or multicultural approach has developed into an issue of much debate within some countries. For example, the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|French]] and British governments and populace are currently debating whether Islamic cultural practices and dress conflict with their attempts to form culturally unified countries.&lt;ref name="Cowell"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/15/news/brits.php|title=Islamic schools at heart of British debate on integration|last=Cowell|first=Alan |date=2006-10-15|publisher=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in other regions==

===Mexico===
{{see also|La Raza Cósmica}}
[[Mexico]] has seen a variety of cultural influences over the years, and in its history has adopted a mixed assimilationist/multiculturalist policy. Mexico, beginning with the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztecs]], had entered a new global empire based on trade and immigration. In the 16th and 17th centuries, waves of Spanish, and to a lesser extent, African and Filipino culture became embedded into the fabric of Mexican culture. It is important to note, however, that from a Mexican standpoint, the immigrants and their culture were no longer considered foreign, but Mexican in their entirety. The food, art, and even heritage were assimilated into a Mexican identity. Upon the [[independence of Mexico]], Mexico began receiving immigrants from Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, again, bringing many cultural influences but being quickly labeled as Mexican, unlike in the United States, where other culture is considered foreign. This assimilation is very evident, even in Mexican society today: for example, [[banda music|banda]], a style of music originating in northern Mexico, is simply a Mexican take on Central European music brought by immigrants in the 18th century. Mexico's thriving beer industry was also the result of German brewers finding refuge in Mexico. Many famous Mexicans are actually of Arab descent; [[Salma Hayek]] and [[Carlos Slim]]. The coastal states of [[Guerrero]] and [[Veracruz]] are inhabited by citizens of African descent. Mexico's national policy is based on the concept of [[mestizaje]], a word meaning "to mix". The immigrants are socially under pressure to adopt a Mexican nationality and become part of the broader culture (speaking Spanish, respect the Catholic heritage, help the society), while contributing useful cultural traits foreign to Mexican society.

Most Argentines are descended from colonial-era settlers and of the 19th- and 20th-century [[Great European immigration wave to Argentina|immigrants from Europe]]. An estimated 8% of the population is [[Mestizo]], and a further 4% of Argentines are of [[Arab Argentine|Arab]] (in Argentina the Arab ethnicity is considered among the [[White people]], just like in the US Census) or [[Asian Argentine|Asian]] heritage.&lt;ref name=statesmen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Argentina.html|title=Argentina|publisher=World Statesmen.org|author=Ben Cahoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last national census, based on self-identification, 600,000 Argentines (2% of the population) declared to be Amerindians&lt;ref name=encuesta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indec.gov.ar/webcenso/ECPI/index_ecpi.asp|publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina]]|title=Encuesta Complementaria de Pueblos Indígenas 2004–2005|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although various genetic tests show that in average, Argentines have 20 to 30% indigenous ancestry, which leads many who are culturally European, to identify as white, even though they are genetically mestizo. Most of the 6 million European immigrants arriving between 1850 and 1950, regardless of origin, settled in several regions of the country. Due to this large-scale European immigration, Argentina's population more than doubled, although half ended up returning to Europe or settling in the United States.
[[File:Non-native population in Argentina.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Immigrant population in Argentina (1869–1991)]]
The majority of these European immigrants came from Spain and Italy mostly, but to a lesser extent, Germany, France, and Russia. Small communities also descend from Switzerland, Wales, Scotland, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Bulgaria, Armenia, Greece, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and several other regions.

Italian population in Argentina arrived mainly from the northern Italian regions varying between [[Piedmont]], [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardy]], later from [[Campania]] and [[Calabria]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feditalia.org.ar/arg/federaciones/feditalia_org_fed_regionales.html |title=Federaciones Regionales |publisher=Feditalia.org.ar |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many Argentines have the gentilic of an Italian city, place, street or occupation of the immigrant as last name, many of them were not necessarily born Italians, but once they did the roles of immigration from Italy the name usually changed. [[Spanish Argentine|Spanish]] immigrants were mainly [[Galician people|Galicians]] and [[Basque Argentine|Basques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdtradition.net/historical-references.php |title=Historical references |publisher=Cdtradition.net |accessdate=2010-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108073617/http://www.cdtradition.net/historical-references.php |archivedate=January 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monografias.com/trabajos14/gallegos/gallegos.shtml |title=Monografías |publisher=Monografias.com |date=2007-05-07 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
Brazil has long been a melting pot for a wide range of cultures. From [[Colonial Brazil|colonial times]] [[Portuguese Brazilians]] have favoured assimilation and tolerance for other peoples, and intermarriage was more acceptable in Brazil than in most other European colonies. However, Brazilian society has never been completely free of ethnic strife and exploitation, and some groups have chosen to remain separate from mainstream social life. Brazilians of mainly European descent (Portuguese, Italian, French, German, Austrian, Spanish, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Lithuanian, Hungarian, etc.) account for more than half the population, although people of mixed ethnic backgrounds form an increasingly larger segment; roughly two-fifths of the total are mulattoes (''mulattos''; people of mixed African and European ancestry) and mestizos (''mestiços'', or ''caboclos''; people of mixed European and Indian ancestry). Portuguese are the main European ethnic group in Brazil, and most Brazilians can trace their ancestry to an [[Portuguese people|ethnic Portuguese]] or a mixed-race Portuguese. Among European descendants, Brazil has the largest [[Italian-Brazilian|Italian diaspora]], the second largest [[German-Brazilian|German diaspora]], as well as other European groups. The country is also home to the largest [[Japanese diaspora]] outside Japan, the [[Arab diaspora|largest Arab community outside the Arab World]] and one of the [[Jews in Brazil|top 10 Jewish populations]].

====Colombia====
Colombia is a melting pot of races and ethnicities. The population is descended from three racial groups—Native Americans, blacks, and whites—that have mingled throughout the nearly 500 years of the country's history. No official figures were available, since the Colombian government dropped any references to race in the census after 1918, but according to rough estimates in the late 1980s, mestizos (white and Native American mix) constituted approximately 50% of the population, whites (predominantly Spanish origin, Italian, German, French, etc.) made a 25%, mulattoes (black-white mix) 14% and zambos  (black and Native American mix) 4%, blacks (pure or predominantly of African origin) 3% percent, and Native Americans 1%.

====Costa Rica====
[[Costa Rica]]n people is a very syncretic melting pot, because this country has been constituted in percentage since the [[16th century]] by immigrants from all the European countries—mostly [[Spaniards]] and [[Italians]] with a lot of [[Germans]], [[british people|British]], [[Swedes]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], [[french people|French]] and [[Croats]]—also as [[black people]] from Africa and Jamaica, [[Americans]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Latin Americans]] who have mestized over time with the large native populations creating the national average modern ethnic composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=D'Onofrio|first1=S|last2=Campos|first2=A|last3=Guillén|first3=F|title=Multiculturalidad en Costa Rica: los inmigrantes y sus descendientes|url=https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4301/35136576774_fbbeee0cee_o.jpg|publisher=Sicultura|language= Spanish|accessdate=6 January 2018|format=JPG|date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays a great part of the Costa Rican habitants are considered white (84%), with minoritaries groups of mulato (7%), indigenous (2%), Chinese (2%) and black (1%). Also, over 9% of the total population is foreign-born (specially from [[Nicaragua]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook – Costa Rica: People and Society|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cs.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Asia===
[[South Asia]] has a long history of inter-ethnic marriage dating back to [[ancient history]]. Various groups of people have been intermarrying for millennia in South Asia, including speakers of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]], and [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] languages.  On account of such diverse influences, South Asia in a nut-shell appears to be a cradle of human civilization. Despite invasions in its recent history it has succeeded in organically assimilating incoming influences, blunting their wills for imperialistic hegemony and maintaining its strong roots and culture. These invasions however brought their own racial mixing between diverse populations and South Asia is considered an exemplary "melting pot" (and not a "salad bowl") by many geneticists for exactly this reason. However, South Asian society has never been completely free of ethnic strife and exploitation, and some groups have chosen to remain separate from mainstream social life. The divisiveness of the [[caste system in India]] has permeated to every facet of the society. Ethnic conflicts in [[Pakistan]] between [[Baloch people|Baloch]], [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]], [[Punjabis]], and [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]]s, are other impediments to the melting pot thesis.

====Afghanistan====
Afghanistan seems to be in the process of becoming a melting pot, as customs specific to particular ethnic groups are becoming summarily perceived as national traits of Afghanistan. The term ''Afghan'' was originally used to refer to the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] in the Middle Ages, and the intention behind the creation of the Afghan state was originally to be a [[Pashtunistan|Pashtun state]], but later this policy changed, leading to the inclusion of non-Pashtuns in the state as Afghans. Today in Afghanistan, the development of a cultural melting pot is occurring, where different Afghanistan ethnic groups are mixing together to build a new Afghan ethnicity composed of preceding ethnicities in Afghanistan today, ultimately replacing the old Pashtun identity which stood for Afghan. With the churning growth of [[Persian language|Persian]], many ethnic groups, including de-tribalized Pashtuns, are adopting Dari Persian as their new native tongue. Many ethnic groups in Afghanistan tolerate each other, while the [[Hazara people|Hazara]]–Pashtun conflict was notable, and often claimed as a [[Shia-Sunni relations|Shia-Sunni conflict]] instead of an ethnic conflict, as this conflict was carried out by the [[Taliban]]. The Taliban, which are mostly ethnically Pashtun, have spurred Anti-Pashtunism across non-Pashtun Afghans. Pashtun–[[Tajik people|Tajik]] rivalries have lingered about, but are much more mild. Reasons for this antipathy are criticism of Tajiks (for either their non-tribal culture or cultural rivalry in Afghanistan) by Pashtuns and criticism of Taliban (mostly composed of Pashtuns) by Tajiks. There have been rivalries between Pashtuns and [[Uzbek people|Uzbeks]] as well, which is likely very similar to the [[Kyrgyz Revolution of 2010|Kyrgyzstan Crisis]], which Pashtuns would likely take place as [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] (for having a similar nomadic culture), rivaling with Tajiks and Uzbeks (of sedentary culture), despite all being [[Sunni]] Muslims.

===Israel===

In the early years of the state of [[Israel]], the term ''melting pot'' (כור היתוך), also known as "Ingathering of the Exiles" (קיבוץ גלויות), was not a description of a process, but an official governmental doctrine of assimilating the Jewish immigrants that originally came from varying cultures (see [[Jewish ethnic divisions]]).  This was performed on several levels, such as educating the younger generation (with the parents not having the final say) and (to mention an anecdotal one) encouraging and sometimes forcing the new citizens to adopt a Hebrew name.

Activists such as the Iraq-born [[Ella Shohat]] that an elite which developed in the early 20th century, out of the earlier-arrived Zionist Pioneers of the Second and Third [[Aliyah|Aliyas]] (immigration waves)—and who gained a dominant position in the [[Yishuv]] (pre-state community) since the 1930s—had formulated a new Hebrew culture, based on the values of [[Socialist Zionism]], and imposed it on all later arrivals, at the cost of suppressing and erasing these later immigrants' original culture.

Proponents of the Melting Pot policy asserted that it applied to all newcomers to Israel equally; specifically, that [[Eastern European]] Jews were pressured to discard their [[Yiddish]]-based culture as ruthlessly as [[Mizrahi]] Jews were pressured to give up the culture which they developed during centuries of life in Arab and Muslim countries. Critics respond, however, that a cultural change effected by a struggle within the [[Ashkenazi]]-East European community, with younger people voluntarily discarding their ancestral culture and formulating a new one, is not parallel to the subsequent exporting and imposing of this new culture on others, who had no part in formulating it. Also, it was asserted that extirpating the Yiddish culture had been in itself an act of oppression only compounding what was done to the Mizrahi immigrants.

Today the reaction to this doctrine is ambivalent; some say that it was a necessary measure in the founding years, while others claim that it amounted to cultural [[oppression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liphshiz|first=Cnaan|title=Melting pot' approach in the army was a mistake, says IDF absorption head|url=http://www.haaretz.com/melting-pot-approach-in-the-army-was-a-mistake-says-idf-absorption-head-1.245477|accessdate=8 November 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=May 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the melting pot policy did not achieve its declared target: for example, the persons born in Israel are more similar from an economic point of view to their parents than to the rest of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhaki, Shlomo and Schechtman, Edna''The "Melting Pot": A Success Story?'' Journal of Economic Inequality, Vol; 7, No. 2, June 2009, pp. 137–51. [http://www1.cbs.gov.il/www/publications/pw32.pdf Earlier version by Schechtman, Edna and Yitzhaki, Shlomo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109003252/http://www1.cbs.gov.il/www/publications/pw32.pdf |date=2013-11-09 }}, Working Paper No. 32, Central Bureau of Statistics, Jerusalem, Nov. 2007, i + 30 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy is generally not practised today though as there is less need for that—the mass immigration waves at Israel's founding have declined. Nevertheless, one fifth of current Israel's Jewish population have immigrated from former [[Soviet Union]] in the last two decades.{{when|date=June 2017}} The Jewish population includes other minorities such as [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jew]]s; Furthermore, 20% of Israel's population is [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab]]. These factors as well as others contribute to the rise of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] as a common principle in the last years.

===Russia===

Already the Kievan Rus was a multi ethnic state where different ethnicities merged, including Slavs, Finns, Turks and Balts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=XqGaBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR12&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=Voyages+in+World+History,+Volume+I,+Brief+page+219+kievan+rus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mG25BSpCz5&amp;sig=Jxb1uHHLvHc9mXTiZbvo1_-67Zc&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXxfWwxZrZAhUMwBQKHYD6ARUQ6AEILjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Voyages%20in%20World%20History%2C%20Volume%20I%2C%20Brief%20page%20219%20kievan%20rus&amp;f=false|title=Voyages in World History, Volume I, Brief|author=Valerie Hansen,Kenneth R. Curtis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later the expansion of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later of the [[Russian Empire]] throughout 15th to 20th centuries created a unique melting pot. Though the majority of [[Russians]] had [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]-speaking ancestry, different ethnicities were assimilated into the Russian melting pot through the period of expansion. [[cultural assimilation|Assimilation]] was a way for ethnic minorities to advance their standing within the Russian society and state—as individuals or groups. It required adoption of Russian as a day-to-day language and [[Orthodox Christianity]] as religion of choice. The Roman Catholics (as in Poland and Lithuania) generally resisted assimilation. Throughout the centuries of eastward expansion of Russia  [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] and [[Turkic peoples]] were assimilated and included into the emerging Russian nation. This includes [[Mordvin]], [[Udmurt people|Udmurt]], [[Mari people|Mari]], [[Tatar]], [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Bashkir people|Bashkir]], and others. Surnames of many of Russia's nobility (including [[Suvorov]], [[Kutuzov]], [[Yusupov]], etc.) suggest their Turkic origin.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Groups of later, 18th- and 19th-century migrants to Russia, from [[Europe]] ([[Germans]], [[French people|French]], [[Italians]], [[Poles]], [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Greeks]], [[Jews]], etc.) or the [[Caucasus]] ([[Georgians]], [[Armenians]], [[Ossetians]], [[Chechens]], [[Azeris]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]] among them) also assimilated within several generations after settling among Russians in the expanding Russian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Dawisha and Bruce Parr, eds. ''The end of empire?: the transformation of the USSR in comparative perspective''  (1996) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===

The '''[[Soviet people]]''' ({{lang-ru|Советский народ}}) was an ideological [[epithet]] for the population of the Soviet Union. The Soviet government promoted the doctrine of [[cultural assimilation|assimilating]] all peoples living in USSR into one ''Soviet people'', accordingly to [[Marxism|Marxist]] principle of [[fraternity of peoples]].

The effort lasted for the entire [[history of the Soviet Union]], but did not succeed, as evidenced by developments in most national cultures in the territory after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.

===Southeast Asia===
The term has been used to describe a number of countries in [[Southeast Asia]]. Given the region's location and importance to trade routes between China and the Western world, certain countries in the region have become ethnically diverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Southeast Asia: The Diversity Dilemma|first1= Sree |last1=Kumar|first2=Sharon|last2=Siddique|date=2008|publisher=Select Publishing|isbn=978-9814022385}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Vietnam, a relevant phenomenon is "tam giáo đồng nguyên", meaning the co-existence and co-influence of three major religious teaching schools (Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism), which shows a process defined as "cultural addivity".&lt;ref name=Vuongetal2018b&gt;{{cite journal|title='Cultural additivity' and how the values and norms of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism co-exist, interact, and influence Vietnamese society: A Bayesian analysis of long-standing folktales, using R and Stan|date=March 4, 2018|newspaper=CEB WP No.18/015 (Centre Emile Bernheim, Université Libre de Bruxelles)|url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=3134541|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====

In the pre-Spanish era the Philippines was the trading nexus of various cultures and eventually became the melting pot of different nations. This primarily consisted of the Chinese, Indian and Arab traders. This is also includes neighboring southeast Asian cultures. The cultures and races mixed with indigenous tribes, mainly of Austronesian descent (i.e. the Indonesians, Malays and Brunei) and the [[Negrito]]s. The result was a mix of cultures and ideals. This melting pot of culture continued with the arrival of Europeans, mixing their western culture with the nation. The [[Spanish Empire]] colonized the Philippines for more than three centuries, and during the early 20th century, was conquered and annexed by the United States and occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]] during [[World War II]]. In modern times, the Philippines has been the place of many retired Americans, Japanese expatriates and Korean students. And continues to uphold its status as a melting pot state today.

==In popular culture==
* ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'' has a song entitled "The Great American Melting Pot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.school-house-rock.com/Grea.html|title=The Great American Melting Pot|publisher=School House Rock|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1969 the song "Melting Pot" was released by the UK band [[Blue Mink]] and charted at #3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p15930/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Dave Thompson |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics espouse how the world should become one big melting pot where different races and religions are to be mixed, "churning out coffee coloured people by the score", referring to the possible pigmentation of children after such racial mixing.
* On ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', an alternative to the melting pot culture was posed on ''[[The Wørd]]'' called "[[Lunchables]]", where separate cultures "co-exist" by being entirely separate and maintaining no contact or involvement (see also [[NIMBY]]).
* In the band [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]]'s song "America" from the album ''[[Volk (album)|Volk]]'', the expression appear in their lyrics in "America, the Melting pot".

'''''Method &amp; Red''''', sometimes written '''''Meth and Red''''', is an American television [[sitcom]] that ran on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] from June 16 to August 25, 2004.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|title=TELEVISION REVIEW; Who Needs Money When You've Got a Lot of Nerve?|author=Heffernan, Virginia|date=June 16, 2004|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/16/arts/television-review-who-needs-money-when-you-ve-got-a-lot-of-nerve.html|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 13, 2004|title=Method &amp; Red|url=https://variety.com/2004/tv/reviews/method-red-1200532840/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[City Pages]]|url=http://www.citypages.com/music/revisiting-method-man-and-redmans-failed-fox-sitcom-method-and-red-6645071|title=Revisiting Method Man and Redman's Failed Fox Sitcom, Method &amp; Red|date=October 24, 2014|author=Kangas, Chaz}}&lt;/ref&gt; It starred [[hip hop music|hip hop]] recording artists [[Method Man &amp; Redman]], portraying fictionalized versions of themselves who move to a predominantly white upper-class suburb in [[New Jersey]].

Fox cancelled the show with 4 of the 13 episodes remaining unaired after heated meetings with Method Man &amp; Redman, who were not pleased with the show. The duo publicly criticized Fox several times after this.

[[Method Man]] was disappointed about the series for having a [[laugh track]] and Fox doing a bad job on editing. He had wanted it to be in the vein of ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]],'' of which he is a fan.

At the same time, Meth and Red promised Skyler that they will appear at his birthday party and he tells everyone at his school. Lil Bit warns Meth and Red that they won't "look too hood, sitting there eating birthday cake, with a bunch of White suburban kids". On top of that, Keith Debeetham reveals one reason he gave 50 Cent a bad review is because he still lives with his mother. The pair have to find a way to 1. Not let Keith know that Dorthy is Meth's mom. 2. Attend Skyler's party. 3. Convince Keith that they have not changed since moving to the suburbs.

==Plot==
IMF operative [[Ethan Hunt]] is on a scuba diving mission to explore a shipwreck off the coast of the Black Sea. Once he finishes observing, he encounters two other IMF agents, one of them who shoots a harpoon at the ship to give Ethan his next mission. As explained, Ethan will have to escort Mikail Marcou, a former advisor of Yugaria's current dictator, Simon Algo, and acquire a mini disk from Algo that contains vital information on Algo's operations.

Ethan arrives at the Yugarian Ministry of Information, and despite a few misteps at the expense of Jasmine Curry, a new member of the IMF team, the mission runs smoothly and Ethan makes contact with Marcou. Marcou, however, tells him when he gets to England on safe grounds, the disk will belong to IMF. The plan goes south, as Marcou is shot and killed by Vasyl Berkut, the head of the Yugarian Secret Service. Ethan takes possession of the disk and pursues Berkut. Berkut escapes, but [[Luther Stickell]] and Billy Baird come to extract Ethan at the last minute and evades capture.

Making his way to Los Muertos Laboratories, Ethan disguises himself as a security guard to gain access to the lower levels of the facility, though it was short lived. He enters the computer core, but was forced to hide when Jong Ho Li, a contractor and ally to Algo, and Sofia Ivanescu, a software engineer, comes to download info onto the core. Once they left, Ethan hacks the core, and Luther reveals Los Muertos' plan to use three strains of neurodioxin. He requests Ethan and new IMF agent George Spelvin (disguising himself as a scientist) to abort the mission, but Ethan refuses and goes to destroy the biological weapons, in which he is successful in doing so. But this results in an alarm going off, and in return, Jong Ho accuses Sofia of being a spy. He places bombs throughout the facility to cover his tracks when it is destroyed, but Ethan disarms them. Outside, Sofia sabotages a helicopter, leaving Jong Ho and his men to Ethan's disposal. Engaging in a shootout, Ethan kills Jong Ho and follows Sofia to Yugaria.

Sneaking back in Yugaria's Ministry of Information, Ethan learns of ICEWORM, a deadly computer virus capable of breaking through any type of security system. Unable to get ICEWORM's codes through the computer, Berkut orders his men to apprehend Sofia to obtain the codes, inadvertently revealing to an overhearing Ethan that Sofia's father, Nicholas Ivanescu (long thought dead) is still alive, but in league with Algo. Using the electronic wasp and a sniper pistol, Ethan protects Sofia from Berkut's men, but as he tries to explains himself to her, she mistakens him for being Berkut's loyal and runs off. However, she almost fell to her death, and Ethan saves her. Ethan vows to not let anything happen to Sofia, and she accepts his offer.

Ethan, Sofia, Jasmine, and Spelvin travel to Sansara (a notorious prison off the North African coast) to destroy the remains of the biological weapons that were relocated from Los Muertos. Jasmine and Spelvin meet with Berkut and enters the "Rat Trap", with Ethan following the three. Meanwhile, Sofia talks with Algo about the use of ICEWORM, with Sofia tells the reason of using the virus as a means to gain revenge for her father's apparent death at the hands of Yugaria's previous corrupt government. Ethan finds Algo's chief bioscientist in solitary confinement, who is revealed to be Nicholas. He agrees to help  Ethan destroy the neurodioxin, and the latter takes Sofia to the data center so she can help him advance to the lab. Knocking out Berkut with the wasp, Ethan impersonates him and disables the neurodioxin. Meeting with Nicholas, Ethan witnesses Algo kill Spelvin, injure Jasmine, and take Sofia hostage through his microcamera. He plants explosives in the lab, and tells Nicholas to escape. Ethan covers Jasmine as she makes her escape. Unable to find Sofia nor Algo, Ethan escapes thanks to Billy coming back for Ethan.

Learning that Algo's using a plane as form of headquarters, Ethan skydives and activates a jetpack to make his way to the plane. On board, Algo betrays and kills Berkut by using an experimental rocket launcher. Moments later, Ethan boards the plane and plants explosives on each wing of the plane. Ethan finds Sofia in the cabin, but Algo surprises him. As he prepares to kill her, Sofia kicks him out of the plane, but not before he grabs her and she falls. Ethan pursues the two, grabbing a parachute from one of Algo's men in the process. He rescues Sofia, and sees that Algo has landed in the SURMA Building, a company he runs as a front for his terrorist activities.

Ethan and Sofia land on the SURMA Building, where Algo meets them. As Sofia runs to find a safe place, Ethan hunts down Algo throughout the rooftop. The two meet for a final confrontation, where Algo uses an experimental invisibility device to his advantage. Despite this, Ethan disrupts the technology and Algo is subsequently killed.

Weeks after the incident, Ethan and Sofia are on a private cruise miles off the coast of Aruba. As Sofia says her dealings with technology are over, she and Ethan kiss, and the two go on a scuba diving adventure.

'''#NEWPALMYRA''' (Also known as the '''New Palmyra Project''') is an effort to reconstruct the ancient city of [[Palmyra]] as an immersive virtual environment, based on archaeological and other clues.  The project was started from photos [[Bassel Khartabil]] had been taking of Palmyra since 2005.  He began building models of the ancient city, with support from [[Al Aous Publishers]].   
In 2012, Khartabil was arrested, and the original project and open source files were lost.  Barry Threw took over as director of the project, renamed #NEWPALMYRA, and a community of developers, modelers, and archaeologists began collaborating to model, restore, and later recreate from scratch those historical structures captured on film and camera.

In 2015, ISIL captured Palmyra and began destroying some of its famous historical sites. In late 2015, the [[Institute for Digital Archaeology]] began contributing to the New Palmyra Project, sending archaeologists with cheap 3D cameras to capture any  further structures that ISIL might decide to destroy.

[[File:Arch-of-triumph-3D-print.stl|thumb|right|100px|Arch of Triumph as a 3D model]]
One of the best known structures in Palmyra was the monumental Arch of Triumph (قوس النصر). Constructed during the reign of Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] (193 to 211), it was sometimes mistakenly referred to as [[Hadrian]]’s arch. It was restored in the 1930s, and then destroyed completely during the [[Syrian Civil War]] in 2015.

Palmyra's main streets were not at right angles, and this arch was famously built at a 30-degree turn in the colonnade between the tetrapylon (التترابيل) and the Temple of Bel (معبد بل), with two richly carved façades angled away from one another.

A square platform, each corner containing a group of four columns. This was erected during the renovations of Diocletian at the end of the 3rd century. Each column had a pedestal in its center that originally supported a statue. The original columns were brought from Egypt and carved out of pink granite.  Only one was undamaged in 1963 when the whole was restored with concrete. Destroyed again by [[ISIL]] on January 20, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2016/1210/ISIS-recaptures-Palmyra-A-fresh-assault-on-heritage-sites-video|title=ISIS recaptures Palmyra: A fresh assault on heritage sites?

[[Image:Bassel-bel-3.jpg|thumb|alt=Temple of Bel rendering|Temple of Bel rendering.|100x100px]]This ancient temple was dedicated to the Mesopotamian god Bel in 32 AD.  Bel was worshipped at Palmyra along with the moon god Aglibol and the sun god Yarhibol.  The ruins of the temple were among the best preserved at Palmyra.  they were destroyed by ISIL in August, 2015.

This was the first statue modeled by #rsssd (Re-Sculpting Syrian Statues Digitally).  In 2015 it was destroyed by ISIL.

== Reconstructions and exhibits ==
A 12-ton lifesize replica of part of the Arch of Triumph was carved into stone, from these models, and installed in London's Trafalgar Square in 2016.

A number of small artefacts were reconstructed and displayed at the 2016 Venice Architecture Biennale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/events/venice-biennale/|title=Venice Biennale|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7601">'''Network of practice''' (often abbreviated as '''NoP''') is a concept originated by [[John Seely Brown]] and Paul Duguid.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the overall set of various types of informal, emergent [[social network]]s that facilitate information exchange between individuals with practice-related goals. In other words, networks of practice range from communities of practice where [[learning]] occurs to electronic networks of practice (often referred to as virtual or electronic communities).

== Basic concepts ==
To further define the concept, first the term network implies a set of individuals who are connected through social relationships, whether they be strong or weak. Terms such as [[community]] tend to denote a stronger form of relationship, but networks refer to all networks of social relationships, be they weak or strong. Second, the term practice represents the substrate that connects individuals in their networks. The principal ideas are that practice implies the actions of individuals and groups when conducting their work, e.g., the practice of software engineers, journalists, educators, etc., and that practice involves interaction among individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Lave, Jean, ''Cognition in Practice: Mind, Mathematics and Culture in Everyday Life'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

What distinguishes a network of practice from other networks is that the primary reason for the emergence of relationships within a network of practice is that individuals interact through information exchange in order to perform their work, asking for and sharing knowledge with each other. A network of practice can be distinguished from other networks that emerge due to other factors, such as interests in common hobbies or discussing sports while taking the same bus to work, etc. Finally, practice need not necessarily be restricted to include those within one [[profession|occupation]] or functional discipline. Rather it may include individuals from a variety of occupations; thus, the term, practice, is more appropriate than others such as occupation.

As indicated above, networks of practice incorporate a range of informal, emergent networks, from communities of practice to electronic networks of practice. In line with Lave &amp; Wenger's original work (1991), Brown &amp; Duguid propose that communities of practice are a localized and specialized subset of networks of practice, typically consisting of strong ties linking individuals engaged in a shared practice who typically interact in face-to-face situations.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J S &amp; Duguid, P, Knowledge and organization: A social-practice perspective. [http://web.gsia.cmu.edu/orgsci/index.htm ''Organization Science''], 12, 2: 198-213, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; At the opposite end of the spectrum are electronic networks of practice, which are often referred to as virtual or electronic communities and consisting of weak ties.&lt;ref&gt;Vaast E. [http://www.chris-kimble.com/KNICOP/Chapters/Chapter_18.html The Use of Intranets: The Missing Link between Communities of Practice and Networks of Practice?] Chapter 18 ''in'' Hildreth, P &amp; Kimble, C (eds.), ''Knowledge Networks: Innovation Through Communities of Practice'', London: Idea Group Inc., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In electronic networks of practice, individuals may never get to know one another or meet face-to-face, and they generally coordinate through means such as [[blogs]], [[electronic mailing list]]s, or [[bulletin boards]].

== Distinguishing from formal work groups such as project teams ==
In contrast to the use of formal controls to support knowledge exchange often used in formal work groups, such as contractual obligation, organizational [[hierarchy|hierarchies]], monetary incentives, or mandated rules, networks of practice promote knowledge flows along lines of practice through informal social networks. Therefore, one way to distinguish between networks of practice and work groups created through formal organizational mandate is by the nature of the ''control mechanisms''.

A second group of distinguishing properties refers to their ''composition''. Networks of practice and formal work groups vary in terms of their ''size'' since networks of practice may range from a few select individuals to very large, open electronic networks consisting of thousands of participants while groups are generally smaller. They also vary in terms of ''who can participate''. Work groups and virtual teams typically consist of members who are formally designated and assigned. In contrast, networks of practice consist of volunteers without formal restrictions placed on membership.

Finally, networks of practice and formal work groups vary in terms of ''expectations about participation''. In formal work groups and virtual teams, participation is jointly determined and members are expected to achieve a specific work [[Objective (goal)|goal]]. Participation in communities of practice is jointly determined, such that individuals generally approach specific others for help. In electronic networks of practice, participation is individually determined; knowledge seekers have no control over who responds to their questions or the quality of the responses. In turn, knowledge contributors have no assurances that seekers will understand the answer provided or be willing to reciprocate the favor.

'''Orme's law''' is a rule of thumb to assist modelers when they design an [[Model_aircraft#Electric_power|electric power system]] for their [[Radio-controlled aircraft|radio-controlled model]].  Orme's law simply recommends the use of one [[Nickel metal hydride|NiMH]] rechargeable battery cell for every {{convert|35|in2|cm2}} of wing area for sport planes. One cell for every {{convert|50|in2|cm2}} of wing area for trainers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ezonemag.com/pages/faq/a904.shtml |title=What is Orme's Law? |work=The E Zone |accessdate=2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When using [[Lithium polymer batteries|LiPo]] cells with higher voltage, the number of cells is cut in half, since a LiPo cell has double the voltage.

==Origin==
This rule is the work of Matthew Orme,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orme.org&lt;/ref&gt; who used to manage the sales of Aveox’s line of motors to the hobby market, and later developed a small high performance line of brushless motors at RazorMotors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.razormotors.com&lt;/ref&gt; Matt wanted to come up with a simpler way to recommend systems to the many people who ask him for advice powering their models. [[Brushless DC electric motor|Brushless motors]] are very versatile and it can be hard for newcomers to decide which system they should use.

==Need for Orme's law==
The main purpose was to demonstrate to the modeler that the electric motor was not the source of power like an internal combustion engine. With an IC engine, a particular sized engine will have a particular power output. Typically a model airplane manufacturer will recommend a 2-cycle [[Glow engine|glow plug motor]] by its size (typically .40-.60 cubic inch for the average sized plane) Since electric motors operate over a much wider range, there was no good way to recommend an electric motor for a plane. 

Orme's law makes it clear that the battery pack is the power source, and it determines the available power, not the electric motor. Once the power requirements of any particular airplane model have been determined, an electric motor can be chosen to match the power source. i.e., a 10 cell NiMh battery pack produces approximately 1 volt per cell under load. At 30 amps, that translates to .4 HP.

==System selection==
Matt Orme’s rule makes system selection easy. Orme’s law assumes that the hobbyist will be using 1700 to 2000 mAH cells and will prop for 4 minutes of flight, or 30 amps. 2000 mAH = 2 amp hours or 120 amp minutes, hence the 4-minute flight time (120 amp-minutes /30 amps) at full throttle, with increasing flight times at reduced throttle settings.

Applying the rule using a hobbyist's Citabria Pro electric conversion, which has {{convert|560|in2|cm2}} of wing area, it needs exactly 16 cells according to Orme's law. Before Orme's law, much more work was needed to design the power for the system.

'''''Pittura infamante''''' ({{IPA-it|pitˈtuːra imfaˈmante|pron}}; [[Italian language|Italian]] for "defaming portrait"; plural ''pitture infamanti'') is a [[genre]] of [[defamation|defamatory]] [[painting]] and [[relief]], common in [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]] in [[city-state]]s in the north and center of the [[Italian Peninsula]] during the [[Trecento]], [[Quattrocento]], and [[Cinquecento]].&lt;ref name="edgerton"/&gt; Popular subjects of ''pittura infamante'' include [[treason|traitors]], [[theft|thieves]], and those guilty of [[bankruptcy]] or public [[fraud]], often in cases where no legal remedy was available. Commissioned by governments of [[city-state]]s and displayed in public centers, ''pittura infamante'' were both a form of "municipal justice" (or "forensic art"&lt;ref name="ed31"&gt;Edgerton, 1980, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;) and a medium for internal political struggles.&lt;ref&gt;Wieruszowski, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to Samuel Edgerton, the genre began to decline precisely when it came to be regarded as a [[form of art]] rather than [[effigy]]; the power of the genre derived from a feudal-based [[code of honor]], where [[shame]] was one of the most significant [[social punishment]]s.&lt;ref name="edgerton"&gt;Edgerton, 1985. Chapters 2 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ''pittura infamante'' has its roots in the doctrines of ''[[pheme|fama]]'' and ''[[infamia]]'' in ancient [[Roman law]].&lt;ref name="mills38"&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==
''Pitture infamanti'' could appear in any public place, but some places were more frequently adorned with them; for example, the first floor exterior of the [[Bargello]] periodically contained numerous, life-size, ''pittura infamante'' [[fresco]]es. Florentine law required the ''[[Podestà]]]'' have such caricatures painted, and accompanied by verbal identification those held in [[contempt of court]] for financial offenses (bad debt, bankruptcy, fraud, forgery, etc.).&lt;ref name="ed2"/&gt; ''Pitture infamanti'' were far more common in [[Republic of Florence|Republican Florence]] than in [[Italian city-states|autocratic city states]], whose rulers often deemed them to be sources of "disrepute."&lt;ref&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Common themes of ''pittura infamante''&amp;mdash;which were meant to be humiliating&amp;mdash;include depicting the subject as wearing a mitre or hanging upside down, being in the presence of unclean animals such as pigs or donkeys or those deemed evil like snakes; ''pittura infamante'' would also contain captions listing the offenses of the subject.&lt;ref name="dean7"&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pittura infamante'' could originate as more favorable depictions, only to be transformed after the subject had fallen out of favor.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imagery==
''Pittura infamante'' always depicted men and never women, and generally depicted upper class men (who would have the most to lose from [[character assassination]]).&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt; The act of hanging itself was also significant, as affluent criminals would generally be afforded the privilege of beheading rather than hanging; hanging was also shameful in religious contexts (e.g. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]).&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt; The [[Literary topos|topos]] of ''mundus inversus'' ("world upside down") is often associated with comedy and humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous artists who painted ''pitture infamanti'' frescoes include [[Andrea del Castagno]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], and [[Andrea del Sarto]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, 1980, p. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no surviving examples of ''pitture infamanti'' frescoes, but contemporary sources suggest that they were brightly colored.&lt;ref name="ed31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dean7"/&gt; Detailed descriptions of ''pitture infamanti'' in primary sources are rare.&lt;ref name="dean45"&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; A very few preparatory drawings, however, are extant, and [[The Hanged Man (Tarot card)|The Hanged Man]] from [[Tarot]] cards is thought to resemble the archetypal ''pittura infamante'' theme, as Tarot decks were first produced in northern Italy in the 1440s.&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt;

==Records==
Documentary evidence for ''pittura infamante'' outside Italy is rarer but existent. For example, records support the use of "very unpleasant pictures" painted on cloths during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the reign of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] in [[France]], and&amp;mdash;later&amp;mdash;in [[England]] and north [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 43-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pitture infamanti'' were the counterpoint of another contemporary form of secular, full-length portrait: ''uomini famosi'' ("famous men") or ''uomini illustri'' ("illustrious men"), which depicted figures from the [[Old Testament]] or [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] in a positive context, generally on the interior of private or civic buildings as moral exemplars.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pituri''' is a mixture of leaves and wood ash traditionally chewed as a [[stimulant]] (or, after extended use, a [[depressant]]) by [[Australian Aboriginal|Aboriginal Australians]] widely across the continent. Leaves are gathered from any of several species of native tobacco (''[[Nicotiana]]'') or from at least one distinct population of the species ''[[Duboisia hopwoodii]]''. Various species of ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Grevillea]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' are burned to produce the ash. The term "pituri" may also refer to the plants from which the leaves are gathered or from which the ash is made.&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt; Some authors use the term to refer only to the plant ''Duboisia hopwoodii'' and its leaves and any chewing mixture containing its leaves.&lt;ref name=Silcock&gt;Silcock JL, Tischler M, Smith MA.

==History==
[[File:Joseph Banks 1773 Reynolds.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Joseph Banks, as painted by [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]] in 1773]]
The earliest record of Aboriginal chewing is found in [[Joseph Banks]]'s 1770 journal:&lt;ref name=Ratsch&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The pituri story: a review of the historical literature surrounding traditional Australian Aboriginal use of nicotine in Central Australia.|last = Ratsch|first = A|date = 2010|journal = Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine|doi = 10.1186/1746-4269-6-26|pmid = 20831827|last2 = Steadman|first2 = KJ|first3 = F|last3 = Bogossian|pmc=2944156|volume=6|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beaglehole&gt;Cited in Ratsch ''et al''. 2010. &lt;br&gt;Beaglehole JC. The Endeavour journal of Joseph Banks 1768–1771 [Volume Two] some account of that part of New Holland now called New South Wales. Angus and Robertson Limited; 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|We observed that some, though but few, held constantly in their mouths the leaves of an herb which they chewed as a European does tobacco or an East Indian Beetle. What sort of plant it was, we had not an opportunity of learning, as we never saw anything but the chaws which they took from their mouths to show us..."|Joseph Banks, ''The Endeavour Journal, Volume II'', 26 August 1770.}}

[[Edmund Kennedy]], in his 1847 record of a journey beyond the [[Barcoo River]], described a leaf, tasting strong and hot with the aroma and flavour of tobacco, being chewed by the Aboriginal people.&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beale&gt;Cited in Ratsch ''et al''. 2010. &lt;br&gt;Beale E, Kennedy EBC, Turner AA. The Barcoo and beyond, 1847: the journals of Edmund Besley Court Kennedy and Alfred Allatson Turner with new information on Kennedy's life. Hobart: Blubber Head Press; 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burke and Wills]], on their ill-fated 1861 journey through inland Australia, were given food by local Aboriginal people and also "stuff they call bedgery or pedgery" to chew, which Wills found highly intoxicating even in small amounts.&lt;ref name=Wills&gt;Cited in Ratsch ''et al''. 2010. &lt;br&gt;Wills W.

Bulletin No. 96. Perth: Government Printer; 1926. Revised edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other nineteenth century reports said chewing pituri made old men wise, induced valour in warfare and allowed Aboriginal people to walk hundreds of kilometres without food or water; and a 1901 report claimed they "will usually give anything they possess for it". These reports generated significant curiosity within the local scientific community about the identity of the source plant and the identity of pituri's active chemical constituent.&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt;

===Scientific investigations===

In 1872, [[Joseph Bancroft]], a Brisbane physician, received pituri leaves from south-west [[Queensland]], and performed the first pharmacological investigation. He reported that extract of pituri is toxic to frogs, rats, cats and dogs, with a very small dose diluted in water and injected under the skin causing death after respiratory arrest in some cases.&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bancroft&gt;Cited in Ratsch ''et al''. 2010. &lt;br&gt;Bancroft J. The pituri poison. Paper read before the Queensland Philosophical Society. Government Printer; 1872.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bancroft received more specimens in 1877, collected on an expedition to north-west Queensland by the explorer [[William Hodgkinson]] and identified by [[Ferdinand von Mueller]] as the broken leaves and twigs of the shrub ''[[Duboisia hopwoodii]]''.  Hodgkinson was taken aback by Bancroft's assessment of pituri's toxicity, and said it was as benign as tobacco:&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt; {{quote|...your remarks as to the toxicological properties of petcherie must I confess astonish me. Sixteen years ago, when with Burke and Wills expedition, subsequently with Mr McKinlay and recently in the north west expedition, I used petcherie habitually when procurable in default of tobacco and have often chewed it both in its raw and prepared state.|William Hodgkinson quoted by Bancroft, 1877}} Bancroft took Hodgkinson's samples to Britain and France where English researchers concluded the plant "is more closely allied to tobacco" and a Parisian chemist identified the active constituent as [[nicotine]]. This surprised Bancroft who had compared his extract from the first batch of pituri to nicotine and found the former to be much more toxic than the latter, a finding confirmed in 1880 in experiments performed by Liversidge in Sydney on some new ''Duboisia hopwoodii'' specimens, and supported by an 1882 report that described Aboriginal hunters in central Australia steeping the leaves of ''Duboisia hopwoodii'' in waterholes to stupefy prey that drink the water, and other reports describing cattle, sheep and camels which ate it dying. Yet, when Liversidge sent more samples from yet another batch to England for analysis in 1890 the researchers replied, "there was no obvious difference between its action and that of nicotin[e]." 

Research into the identity of pituri's active constituent and its toxicity continued to yield contradictory results over the following decades.&lt;ref name="Ratsch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Von_Mueller"&gt;Cited in Ratsch ''et al''. 2010. &lt;br&gt;Von Mueller F.

===Identifying the plant===
[[File:Nicotiana suaveolens (Edwards).jpg|thumb|right|''Nicotiana suaveolens'', sometimes used in central Australia as the active ingredient in pituri.]]
Ferdinand von Mueller had identified Bancroft's 1877 batch of pituri as the crushed leaves and twigs of the shrub, ''Duboisia hopwoodii'', and writers subsequently referred to ''Duboisia hopwoodii'' as the raw material of pituri. For instance, in his report on the 1891 Elder expedition into northwest [[South Australia]] and the [[Deserts of Australia|Gibson, Great Sandy and Great Victoria deserts]] of [[Western Australia]], [[Richard Helms (naturalist)|Richard Helms]] noted, "Whilst these tribes have discovered the stimulating properties of ''[[Nicotiana suaveolens]]'' [a variety of native tobacco], they do not seem to know the more powerful narcotic of 'pituri', ''Duboisia hopwoodii'', which also occurs in many places throughout the same regions."&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Helms&gt;Cited in Ratsch ''et al''. 2010. &lt;br&gt;Helms R. Anthropology [Report of the Elder Scientific Expedition, 1891] Transactions of the Royal Society of South Australia. 1896;16:237–332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in 1933 Johnston and Cleland reported that the plant Europeans usually associate with pituri, ''Duboisia hopwoodii'', is not used for chewing across most of central Australia – a variety of native tobacco is; and two years later Hicks and Le Messurier found in a 300-mile radius around the south-west, north-west and north of [[Alice Springs]] people "chewed, under the name of 'pituri' the leaves of at least two varieties of ''Nicotiana''  ... they wished to indicate that [''Duboisia hopwoodii''] was 'pituri', but only used when real pituri, i.e. ''Nicotiana'', was unobtainable."&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnston&gt;Cited in Ratsch ''et al''. 2010. &lt;br&gt;Johnston H, Cleland B. The history of the Aboriginal narcotic, pituri. Oceania. 1933;4:201–289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hicks&gt;Cited in Ratsch ''et al''. 2010. &lt;br&gt;Hicks CS, Le Messurier H. Preliminary observations on the chemistry and pharmacology of the alkaloids of D.Hopwoodii. Australian Journal of Experiments, Biology and Medical Science. 1935. pp.&amp;nbsp;175–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

So, it was now clear that pituri is not one substance and the term relates to the chewing of the leaves of various plants including ''Duboisia hopwoodii'' and more than one species of the native tobacco genus ''Nicotiana''.&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt;

===Active constituents===

It has long been known that the active constituent in Australia's various ''Nicotiana'' species is [[nicotine]]. Twentieth century chemical analysis found that both nicotine and [[nornicotine]], a drug four times as toxic as nicotine, are usually present in ''Duboisia hopwoodii'', and the concentrations of these chemicals can vary widely. In one study, specimens of ''duboisia hopwoodii'' from [[Western Australia]] and western [[Queensland]] were found to contain mainly nicotine while the active constituent of [[South Australia]]n and central Australian ''Duboisia hopwoodii'' was predominantly the more toxic nornicotine. It has been proposed that these variations may be due to differences in rainfall, harvest season and soil salinity and acidity.&lt;ref name="Ratsch" /&gt;

So Bancroft's and Liversidge's experimental animals may have been injected with extracts of ''Duboisia hopwoodii'' high in the toxic nornicotine, while the specimens they sent to Europe for assessment (collected from different locations at different times) contained the more benign nicotine and little or no nornicotine. The reports of animal poisonings probably relate to the consumption of ''Duboisia hopwoodii'' high in nornicotine.&lt;ref name="Ratsch"/&gt;

==Preparation and use==

In central Australia, various species of wild ''Nicotiana'', not ''Duboisia hopwoodii'', are used. ''[[Nicotiana gossei]]'' and a subspecies of ''[[Nicotiana rosulata]]'' called ''[[Ingulba]]'' are preferred.&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt; In a small area west of the [[Mulligan River]] in south-western Queensland, a distinct population of ''Duboisia hopwoodii'', low in nornicotine, has been traditionally used and traded widely.&lt;ref name=Letnic&gt;Cited in Ratsch ''et al''. 2010. &lt;br&gt;Letnic M, Keogh L. Pituri country. pp.&amp;nbsp;61–79 in Desert Channels: The impulse to conserve. Edited by Robin L, Dickman C &amp; Martin M. CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood, Victoria. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=French&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = French | first1 = P | last2 = James | first2 = E | last3 = Walsh | first3 = N | year = 2012 | title = Analysis of genetic variation in a disjunct, narcotic producing, population of Duboisia hopwoodii (F.

Fresh or dried leaves are broken up, mixed with ash and chewed to form a "quid" (a roll about the size and shape of a cigarette). The ash is thought to raise the [[pH]] of the mixture and facilitate the release of nicotine from the plant and its absorption through the mouth wall. Various types of wood are burned for ash including species of ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Grevillea]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus]]''. ''[[Acacia salicina]]'', whose ash is very high in the [[alkali]] [[calcium sulphate]], is one of the preferred species.&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;Cited in Ratsch ''et al''. 2010. &lt;br&gt;Peterson N.

Sydney:Allen and Unwin; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The quid is chewed from time to time and held behind the lower lip or cheek for long periods, where the thin skin, richly endowed with blood vessels, readily absorbs the nicotine. It may be shared with others, passing from person to person until returned to its owner. It may be carried pressed behind the ear, under a breast or beneath a head- or arm-band – possibly acting as a [[nicotine patch]]. A fresh quid may be prepared and held in the mouth while sleeping, so that for some chewers nicotine absorption is constant.&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt;

==Pharmacology==

At first, nicotine acts as a [[stimulant]], boosting the production or availability of chemicals such as [[acetylcholine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]], [[beta-endorphin]] and [[serotonin]] in the brain and other parts of the body. After sustained use, though, the body's ability to maintain heightened levels of these chemicals is temporarily exhausted and nicotine begins to act as a [[depressant]] and in high doses may induce stupor or trance.&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt;

==Trade==

In traditional Aboriginal Australia there was an extensive network of trade routes across the continent and pituri was bartered for such goods as [[boomerangs]], spears, shields and [[ochre]].&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barr/&gt;

==Name==

"Pituri" is one of several names used to refer to native plant matter held in the mouth for the extraction of nicotine. In central Australian dialects the consonants p and b are interchangeable, as are t and d, and early European writers employed a wide variety of spellings.&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 2944156 | pmid=20831827 | doi=10.1186/1746-4269-6-26 | volume=6 | title=The pituri story: a review of the historical literature surrounding traditional Australian Aboriginal use of nicotine in Central Australia | year=2010 | journal=J Ethnobiol Ethnomed | page=26 | last1 = Ratsch | first1 = A | last2 = Steadman | first2 = KJ | last3 = Bogossian | first3 = F}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Bancroft]], Australia's founding pharmacologist and the first to test its pharmacological properties, seems to have been the first to use the spelling "pituri".&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bancroft/&gt;

The term is used by Aboriginal Australians to refer not only to the leaf or the mixture of ash and leaf that is chewed but also to the shrubs and trees that are the sources of the ash and leaf.&lt;ref name=Ratsch/&gt;

A '''revivalist artist''' or '''revivalist band''' is a musical group, singer, or musician dedicated to reviving interest in a musical genre from an earlier era.

Such performers are usually dedicated enthusiasts of a particular musical genre – often a style that is no longer in vogue – and act as evangelists to spread awareness and appreciation of that music to new audiences. Most such acts do this by live performances at a variety of venues.

Unlike [[tribute act]]s who are usually dedicated to recreating material associated with just one primary artist (such as [[Elvis Presley]] or [[The Beatles]]) as a nostalgic entertainment, revivalist artists tend to draw on material from a wide range of artists and writers from the chosen musical genre.

Unlike [[cover band]]s who are primarily populist entertainers playing [[cover versions]] of popular hit songs to satisfy audience enjoyment of familiar music, revivalist artists usually see themselves as performers with a musical mission to revive a cherished genre. They often draw from a much broader repertoire of music than just the obvious hit songs of an era.  Sometimes the mission includes drawing the audience's attention to forgotten or overlooked songs from the genre as well as the better-known hits.

Most revivalist artists focus on performing material only from the original era that they are reviving. They replenish their repertoire by digging deeper in the catalogue of music from their chosen genre.  Some artists eventually aspire to write new material in a similar style and become known for their own compositions.

[[File:Traffic jam Rio de Janeiro 03 2008 28.JPG|thumb|right|[[Traffic congestion]] may be a contributing factor to driver frustration and road rage.|300px]]
'''Road rage''' is aggressive or angry behavior exhibited by a driver of a road vehicle, which includes rude and offensive gestures, verbal insults, physical threats or dangerous driving methods targeted toward another driver or a [[pedestrian]] in an effort to intimidate or release frustration. Road rage can lead to altercations, assaults and collisions that result in serious physical injuries or even death. It can be referred to as an extreme case of [[aggressive driving]].&lt;ref name="Sourced from AAA Foundation" /&gt;

The term originated in the United States in 1987–1988 from anchors at [[KTLA]], a television station in [[Los Angeles, California]], when a rash of freeway shootings occurred on the Interstate 405, 110, and 10 freeways in Los Angeles. These shooting sprees even spawned a response from the [[American Automobile Association|AAA Motor Club]] to its members on how to respond to drivers with road rage or aggressive maneuvers and gestures.

According to a study by the [[AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety]] that examined police records nationally, there are more than 1,200 incidents of road rage on average reported per year in the United States, a number of which have ended with serious injuries or even fatalities. These rates rose yearly throughout the six years of the study.&lt;ref name="Sourced from AAA Foundation "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arizona.drivinguniversity.com/driving-safety/road-rage |title=Road Rage |publisher=Arizona Driving University |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have found that individuals with road rage were predominantly young (33 years old on average) and 96.6% male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sansone |first1=Randy A. |last2=Sansone |first2=Lori A. |journal=Psychiatry |date=July 2010 |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=14–18 |pmc=2922361 |title=Road Rage: What's Driving It? |pmid=20805914}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, a gun-wielding truck driver was accused of firing at more than 762 vehicles and arrested in 2013, an exceptional case of road rage. According to authorities, the autobahn sniper was motivated by "annoyance and frustration with traffic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/25/autobahn-sniper-road-rage-shootings-germany|title=Autobahn sniper admits more than 700 road rage shootings in Germany|last=Connolly|first=Kate|date=2013-06-25|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
[[File:Korek Brama Portowa.jpg|thumb|right|A traffic jam in Poland|293x293px]]
In some jurisdictions, there can be a legal difference between "road rage" and "[[aggressive driving]]." In the U.S., only a few states have enacted special aggressive driving laws, where road rage cases are normally prosecuted as [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] (with or without a vehicle), or "[[vehicular homicide]]."{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} 

The legal definition of road rage encompasses a group of behaviors expressed while driving, or stemming from traffic-related incidents. The U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] defines road rage as when "The operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property." This definition makes the distinction that aggressive driving is a traffic violation and road rage is a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://one.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/research/aggdrivingenf/pages/introduction.html#fn1|title=DOT HS 809 707|website=one.nhtsa.gov|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Effects on drivers==
[[File:Learner driver practising reversing in Quatremaine Road - geograph.org.uk - 858435.jpg|thumb|right|A [[driver's education|learner driver]] practising reversing. [[The Automobile Association|The AA]] has reported that learner drivers and [[driving instructor]]s are becoming targets of road rage at an increasing rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learner drivers targeted by road rage 'idiots'|url=www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/news/driving-school-road-rage-idiots.html|website=[[The Automobile Association|The AA]]|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A stressed driver’s behavior depends on that driver’s coping abilities. Generally, drivers who scored high on aggression tests used direct confrontation strategies when faced with stress while driving. Strategies include long horn honks, swerving, tailgating and attempting to fight the other driver. Many drivers who experience road rage have admitted that they believe they commit more traffic violations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safemotorist.com/articles/road_rage.aspx|title=What Causes Road Rage {{!}} Road Rage Defined {{!}} How to Deal with Road Rage|website=www.safemotorist.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Driving presents many stresses any time a person is behind the wheel because of high speeds and other drivers making different decisions. As stress increases, the likelihood of a person having road rage increases dramatically, and if a person has road rage, their stress levels increase. Typically, younger males are most susceptible to road rage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/road-rage-what-it-is-how-to-avoid-it|title=Road Rage: What It Is, How to Avoid It|website=WebMD|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one study, people who customize their cars with stickers and other adornments are more prone to road rage. The number of territory markers predicted road rage better than vehicle value or condition. Furthermore, only the number of bumper stickers, and not their content, predicted road rage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080613/full/news.2008.889.html|title=Bumper stickers reveal link to road rage|last=Kaplan|first=Matt|date=13 June 2008|journal=Nature|access-date=August 28, 2016|doi=10.1038/news.2008.889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Territorial Markings as a Predictor of Driver Aggression and Road Rage|last=Szlemko|first=William J. et al.|date=21 May 2008|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2008.00364.x|volume=38|issue = 6|pages=1664–1688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a medical condition==
Road rage is not an official mental disorder recognized in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (''DSM''), although according to an article published by the [[Associated Press]] in June 2006, the behaviors typically associated with road rage can be the result of a disorder known as [[intermittent explosive disorder]] that is recognized in the DSM. This conclusion was drawn from surveys of some 9,200 adults in the United States between 2001 and 2003 and was funded by the [[National Institute of Mental Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13152708/ns/health-mental_health/t/road-rage-gets-medical-diagnosis/ | title='Road rage' gets a medical diagnosis | publisher=MSNBC | date=2006-06-05 | accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penalties==
Road rage is a relatively serious act: It may be seen as an endangerment of [[public safety]]. It is, however, not always possible to judge intent by external observation, so "road ragers" who are stopped by [[police]] may be charged with other offences such as careless or [[reckless driving]], or may be fined. Road ragers may be considered as criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-03-31/man-charged-over-road-rage-incident/387760 | title=Man charged over road rage incident | publisher=ABC News | date=March 31, 2010 | accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yorkdispatch.com/news/ci_18652272 | title=McSherrystown man charged in road-rage incident | publisher=York Dispatch | date=2011-08-10 | accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
In [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], road rage is considered an extremely serious act. Any person who chases another motorist or shows intimidating and/or bullying towards another road user can be charged with ''predatory driving'', a serious offence that can leave the culprit in jail for up to 5 years. Offenders can also be fined A$100,000 and disqualified from driving, whether or not he or she intended to harm the victim physically. If the predatory driving results in a physical assault or harm, and/or the victim's car was intentionally damaged, penalties can be much more severe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Additionally, most common-law countries prohibit common assault, which could apply to road rage where the personal safety of the victim is seen to be threatened. The common law regards assault as both a criminal and civil matter, leading to both public criminal penalties and private civil liabilities.

=== Germany ===
Road rage, insults and rude gestures in traffic can lead to fines and even prison sentences to drivers who shout insults or make offensive gestures while driving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eur.army.mil/news/2009/2009-11-24-1_RoadRage.pdf Road rage, insults, rude gestures can lead to fines, prison in Germany], Robert Szostek U.S. Army Europe Office of the Provost Marshal Public Affairs Office, November 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]], Road Rage in itself is not an offence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/news/95181866/driving-us-crazy-why-we-need-to-take-road-rage-more-seriously | title=Road rage: Why human behaviour changes behind the wheel | publisher=Stuff | date=July 29, 2017 | author=Sewell, Rochelle | accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Drivers are usually charged with other offences committed during an act of road rage (usually [[assault]] or unlawful possession of an offensive weapon). Drivers have a legal duty to take reasonable care to avoid endangerment of human life when operating a vehicle (s 156 Crimes Act 1961); failure to discharge this duty, such as an act of aggressive driving, can give rise to liability in criminal nuisance (s 146 Crimes Act 1961). Ramming a vehicle constitutes intentional or reckless damage to property, a criminal offence, with a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment (s 269 Crimes Act 1961). New Zealand courts currently have no powers to disqualify drivers who physically assault another road user.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fmo3DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=New+Zealand+courts+currently+have+no+powers+to+disqualify+drivers+who+physically+assault+another+road+user#v=onepage&amp;q=New%20Zealand%20courts%20currently%20have%20no%20powers%20to%20disqualify%20drivers%20who%20physically%20assault%20another%20road%20user&amp;f=false|title=101 Essays for IAS/ PCS &amp; other Competitive Exams|last=Experts|first=Disha|publisher=Disha Publications|isbn=9789386320940|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Singapore ===
Road rage is a criminal offence in Singapore. When found guilty, the offender may be jailed for up to two years and/or fined up to $5,000 for causing damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chong|first1=Elena|title=Bus driver jailed one week for road rage|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/bus-driver-jailed-one-week-for-road-rage|accessdate=1 December 2015|publisher=Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, road rage can result in criminal penalties for assault or more serious offences against the person. The [[Public Order Act 1986]] can also apply to road rage. Sections 4A and 5 of the 1986 Act prohibit public acts likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. Section 4 also prohibits threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause a victim to believe that violence will be used against himself or another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=2236942 |title=Public Order Act 1986 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In some jurisdictions, such as the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]], it is easier to prosecute road rage as reckless driving instead of aggressive driving simply because the burden of proof does not require "intent" to successfully convict.

It is likely that those causing serious injury or death during "road rage" incidents will suffer more serious penalties than those applicable to similar outcomes from simple negligence. In April 2007, a Colorado driver was convicted of first-degree murder for causing the deaths of two motorists in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_5682631 |title=Road-rage killer unrepentant |publisher=The Denver Post |date= 2007-04-16|accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5488641,00.html Road-rage driver offers blame at sentencing: Local News: The Rocky Mountain News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528020652/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5488641,00.html |date=May 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He will serve a mandatory sentence of two consecutive life terms.

Fourteen [[U.S. state]]s have passed laws against aggressive driving. Only one state, [[California]], has turned "road rage" into a legal [[term of art]] by giving it a particular meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d06/vc13210.htm|title=V.C.

==U.S. rankings==
A 2007 study of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas concluded that the cities with the least courteous drivers (most road rage) are [[Miami]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Boston]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1181">'''Rogue literature''' is a literary genre that tells stories from the world of thieves and other criminals that was popular in England in the 16th and 17th centuries. The stories were mostly in a [[confessional writing|confessional form]] and full of vivid descriptions. Rogue literature is an important source in understanding the everyday life of the ordinary people and their language, and the [[thieves' cant|language of thieves]] and beggars. This genre can be related to the stories of [[Robin Hood]] and [[jest book|jest book literature]], as well as early examples of the [[first-person narrative|first voice in fiction]] and [[autobiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Birch, Dinah (ed.) ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'' (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 853.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal authors of such stories were [[Thomas Harman]], [[Robert Copland]], [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]] and [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]].

'''''Round Ireland with a Fridge''''' is a film released in September 2010 by Fridge D'Or Productions. Based on [[Tony Hawks]]' book of the same name, it was written by and stars Tony.

It is directed by [[Ed Bye]] and also stars [[Ed Byrne (comedian)|Ed Byrne]], [[Josie Lawrence]], [[Sean Hughes (comedian)|Sean Hughes]] and [[Sara Crowe]].

==Plot==
The movie tells the story of a disillusioned television personality whose career has stalled and who is looking for answers but doesn't know the questions. When his best friend taunts him for losing his sense of adventure Tony accepts a drunken £100 bet and sets off with his fridge as an unconventional travelling companion.

The film recreates Tony's actual 1997 journey [[hitchhiking]] around [[Ireland]] as he re-evaluated his life and career, found romance, met a wide range of bizarre characters, made many new friends and discovered that people are perfectly prepared to treat a small white domestic appliance as though it was a fully fledged person with a personality in its own right.

During the course of the film the fridge is taken surfing, christened, blessed by nuns, accompanied by a bagpiper, taken to a bachelor festival and becomes the hero of a national radio station as Tony and all those he encountered become aware of the power and philosophy of the fridge.

It is one of the largest and most complex pā in New Zealand, that was designed specifically to counter the [[cannon]]s of the British forces.&lt;ref name="GP2"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = |title= The Modern Gun-Fighter's Pa (From notes supplied by the late Tuta Nihoniho)| publisher= New Zealand Electronic Text Collection|pages =|date = |url= http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-BesPaMa-t1-body-d6-d1-d2.html| accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GP1"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = |title= Gunfighter pā, c1845| publisher= New Zealand history online|pages =|date = |url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/gunfighter-pa| accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org.nz/the-list/details/6549 "Gunfighter Pa" (Tolaga Bay)], Historic Places Trust website&lt;/ref&gt; The earthworks can still be seen.

Ruapekapeka was the site of the last [[Flagstaff War#Battle of Ruapekapeka|battle]] in the [[Flagstaff War]], between Colonial forces and the [[Ngāpuhi]] led by [[Hone Heke]] and [[Te Ruki Kawiti]], which was the first major armed conflict between the Colonial government and the [[Māori people|Māori]].

==Design of Ruapekapeka Pā ==
This war pā was named ruapekapeka (bats' nests) because the pihareinga, or dugouts with narrow circular entrances at top, which gave access to shelters that protected the warriors from cannon fire. These ruas or caves looked like a [[calabash]] buried underground, the narrow end uppermost and could accommodate 15 to 20 warriors.&lt;ref name="TW39-43"&gt;{{cite web| last = Kawiti| first =Tawai |title=Heke's War in the North | issue=No. 16 |work=Te Ao Hou / The New World |pages =38–43|date = October 1956|url= http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao16TeA/c22-7.html| accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Te Ruki Kawiti]] and his allies, including Mataroria and Motiti,&lt;ref name="TW39-43"/&gt; designed Ruapekapeka Pā as a further development of what is now called the "gunfighter pā"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=6549 "Gunfighter Pā"], Historic Places Trust website&lt;/ref&gt; design that was used at the [[Battle of Ohaeawai]]. It was constructed during 1845, in a good defensive position, in an area of no strategic value, well away from non-combatants, as a challenge to British rule. Ruapekapeka Pā improved on the plan of the pā at [[Ohaeawai]], the site of a battle in the Flagstaff War.

The outer walls of the pā had trenches (parepare) in front of and behind palisades that were {{convert|3|m|ft}} high, built using [[puriri]] logs.&lt;ref name="NZW-R1"&gt;{{cite web| last =Cowan| first =James |title= Plan of Ruapekapeka Fortification| publisher=The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Volume I (1845–64)|pages =|year =1955|url= http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/Cow01NewZ-fig-Cow01NewZ076a.html| accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the introduction of muskets the Māori had learnt to cover the outside of the palisades with layers of [[New Zealand flax|flax]] (Phormium tenax) leaves, making them effectively bulletproof as the velocity of musket balls was dissipated by the flax leaves.&lt;ref name="NZW-O2"&gt;{{cite web| last =Cowan| first =James |title= Flax-masked Palisade| publisher=The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Volume I (1845–64)|pages =|year =1955|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/Cow01NewZ-fig-Cow01NewZ053c.html| accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On some of the sides of the pā there were three rows of palisades and on other side there were two rows of palisades.&lt;ref name="NZW-R2"&gt;{{cite web| last =Cowan| first =James |title= From a Royal Navy Officers' Survey, 1846 – Cross-section of Ruapekapeka | publisher=The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Volume I (1845–64)|pages =|year =1955|url= http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/Cow01NewZ-fig-Cow01NewZ077a.html| accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were passages between the front and back trenches (parepare),&lt;ref name="TW39-43"/&gt; so that warriors could move forward to fire and return to shelter to reload. On the high ground an observation tower was erected. At the rear of the pā a well, some {{convert|5|m|ft}} deep, was dug into a sandstone formation to provide a water-supply during the expected [[siege]] of the pā.&lt;ref name="TW39-43"/&gt;

==Battle of Ruapekapeka Pā==

{{Main article|Flagstaff War}}
When the new British Governor, [[George Edward Grey|Sir George Grey]], failed to end the [[Flagstaff War]] by negotiation, he assembled a British force of 1,168 men in the Bay of Islands to deal with [[Hone Heke]] and Te Ruki Kawiti. In early December 1845 the Colonial forces, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Despard, moved by water towards Ruapekapeka and began a two-week advance over {{convert|20|km|mi}} to bring artillery up to the pā.

The ordnance used in the battle were three naval 32-pounders, one 18-pounder, two 12-pounder howitzers, one 6-pounder brass gun, four mortars, and two rocket-tubes ([[Congreve rockets]]).&lt;ref name="Cowan2"/&gt; It took two weeks to bring the heavy guns into range of the pā, they started the cannon bombardment on 27 December 1845. The directing officers were Lieutenant Bland (HMS ''Racehorse'') and Lieutenant Leeds (HEICS ''Elphinstone''); Lieutenant Egerton (HMS ''North Star'') was in charge of firing the rocket-tubes.&lt;ref name="Cowan2"/&gt; Bombardment and an incomplete siege commenced on 27 December 1845 (the British lacking the manpower to completely surround the pā). Several weeks of siege punctuated by skirmishing followed.The guns were fired with accuracy throughout the siege causing considerable damage to the palisades, although those inside the pā were safe in the underground shelters.&lt;ref name="Cowan2"/&gt;

The colonial forces consisted of the 58th Regiment (led by Lieut.-Colonel Wynward), the 99th Regiment (led by Captain Reed) and 42 volunteers from Auckland (led by Captain Atkyns). [[Tāmati Wāka Nene]], [[Eruera Maihi Patuone]], Tawhai, Repa, and [[Nopera Pana-kareao]] led around 450 warriors in support of the colonial forces.&lt;ref name="Cowan2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Cowan |first1= James|authorlink1= |title= The New Zealand Wars: a history of the Maori campaigns and the pioneering period, Volume I: 1845–1864 |url= http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow01NewZ-c9.html|accessdate=  |year= 1922 |publisher= R.E.

The Māori had a deck-cannon (designed for use on a ship) and a [[field gun]].&lt;ref name="TW39-43"/&gt; A marine-gunner scored a direct hit on the deck-cannon after three shots, rendering it useless. In any event the Māori had limited supplies of [[gunpowder]] so that the possession of these guns did not assist the Māori in the defence of Ruapekapeka.&lt;ref name="TW39-43"/&gt; The Māori were armed with double-barrel [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] muskets (''Tupara''), [[flintlock]] muskets (''Ngutuparera'', so called because the hammer holding the flint looked like a duck's beak) as well as some pistols.&lt;ref name="TW39-43"/&gt;

Several weeks of siege punctuated by skirmishing followed, until early on the morning of Sunday 11 January 1846 a British foraging party noted the defenders were unusually quiet. The small group of British troops pushed over the palisade and entered the pā, finding it almost empty. They were reinforced, while Māori tried to re-enter the pā from the back. After a four-hour gun fight the remaining Māori withdrew, abandoning the pā. Lieutenant Colonel Despard claimed the outcome as a "brilliant success".&lt;ref name="NZer"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | work = New Zealander, Volume 1, Issue 34, |title = OFFICIAL DESPATCHES.

Ruapekapeka found a most extraordinary place,--a model of engineering, with a treble stockade, and huts inside, these also fortified. A large embankment in rear of it, full of under-ground holes for the men to live in; communications with subterranean passages enfilading the ditch. Two guns were taken,--a small one, and an 18-pounder, the latter dismantled by our fire. It appeared that they were in want of food and water. It was the strongest pa ever built in New Zealand.}}

The reason why the defenders appeared to have abandoned but then re-entered the pā is the subject of continuing debate. It was later suggested that most of the Māori had been at church (many of them were devout Christians).&lt;ref name="TW39-43"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HR"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Raugh |first1 = Harold E. |authorlink1 = |title= The Victorians at war, 1815–1914: an encyclopedia of British military history |url= |accessdate=  |year=2004 |publisher= ABC-CLIO |location= |language= |isbn= 1-57607-925-2|oclc =  |doi= |id= |page= |pages= 225–226|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing that their opponents, the British, were also Christians they had not expected an attack on a Sunday. Reverend Richard Davis noted in his diary of 14 January 1846:&lt;ref name="Davis3"/&gt;{{quote|Yesterday the news came that the Pa was taken on Sunday by the sailors, and that twelve Europeans were killed and thirty wounded. The native loss uncertain. It appears the natives did not expect fighting on the Sabbath, and were, the great part of them, out of the Pa, smoking and playing. It is also reported that the troops were assembling for service. The tars, having made a tolerable breach with their cannon on Saturday, took the opportunity of the careless position of the natives, and went into the Pa, but did not get possession without much hard fighting, hand to hand.}}

However, later commentators have cast doubt on this explanation of the events of Sunday 11 January, as fighting had continued on a Sunday at the [[Battle of Ohaeawai]] in July 1845. Yet other later commentators suggested that Heke deliberately abandoned the pā to lay a trap in the surrounding bush, as this would provide cover and give Heke a considerable advantage.&lt;ref name="TB1988"&gt;{{cite book | author= Tom Brooking| title = Milestones – Turning Points in New Zealand History | year = 1988|publisher = Mills Publications |page= 69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this scenario, Heke's ambush succeeded only partially, as Kawiti's men, fearing their chief had fallen, returned towards the pā and the British forces engaged in battle with the Māori rebels immediately behind the pā.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath of the battle of Ruapekapeka==
It was Māori custom that the place of a battle where blood was spilt became [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] so that the Ngāpuhi left Ruapekapeka Pā.&lt;ref name="TW39-43"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CARv2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Carleton |first1=Hugh |authorlink1= |title= Vol. II, The Life of Henry Williams|url=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=1046&amp;action=null |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1874 |publisher= [[Early New Zealand Books]] (ENZB), University of Auckland Library|location= |language= |isbn= |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages=76–84|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the battle Kawiti and his warriors, carrying their dead, travelled some {{convert|4|mi}} north-west to [[Waiomio]], the ancestral home of [[Ngāti Hine]].&lt;ref name="TW43"&gt;{{cite web| last = Kawiti| first =Tawai |title=Heke's War in the North | issue=No. 16 |work=Te Ao Hou / The New World |page =43|date = October 1956 |url= http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao16TeA/c22-7.html| accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the battle of Ruapekapeka Kawiti expressed the will to continue to fight,&lt;ref name="TW45-46"&gt;{{cite web| last = Kawiti| first =Tawai |title=Hekes War in the North | issue=No. 16 |work=Te Ao Hou / The New World |pages =45–46|date = October 1956|url= http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao16TeA/c23.html| accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Kawiti and Heke made it known that they would end the rebellion if the Colonial forces would leave the Ngāpuhi land.

[[Tāmati Wāka Nene]] acted as an intermediary in the negotiations with Governor Grey. At this time Governor Grey faced new threats of rebellion in the south and would have had logistical difficulties in a lengthy campaign against Heke and Kawiti; although Governor Grey may have underestimated the difficulties the essentially part-time Māori force would experience in continuing to fight against the Colonial forces. Governor Grey accepted Tāmati Wāka Nene's argument that clemency was the best way to ensure peace in the North. Heke and Kawiti were pardoned and no land was confiscated.&lt;ref name="Tim Ryan p.28"/&gt;

The '''Répertoire International des Sources Musicales''' ('''RISM''', [[English Language|English]] ''International Inventory of Musical Sources'', [[German language|German]] ''Internationales Quellenlexikon der Musik'') is an international non-profit organization, founded in [[Paris]] in 1952, with the aim of comprehensively documenting extant sources of music all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Benton, "Répertoire International des Sources Musicales," ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians,'' 2nd edition, 2002, vol. 21, p. 194. {{ISBN|1-56159-239-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest organization of its kind and the only entity operating globally to document written musical sources. Shortly after its founding, A.H. King called RISM, "one of the boldest pieces of long-term planning ever undertaken for the source material of any subject in the humanistic field."&lt;ref&gt;Alec Hyatt King, "The Music Librarian, his tasks, national and international," ''Fontes Artis Musicae'' 6 (1959): 54; quoted in Benton, 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical sources recorded are manuscripts or printed music, writings about music and libretti. They are stored in [[Library|libraries]], [[archive]]s, [[Monastery|monasteries]], [[school]]s, and [[Private library|private collections]]. RISM establishes ''what'' exists and ''where'' it is kept. RISM is recognized among experts as the key place for documenting music sources all over the world.

The work of RISM in compiling a comprehensive index fulfills a twofold purpose: for one, music documents are protected from loss, and for another, they are made available to scholars and performing musicians.

== Organization ==
[[Image:BWV1001.jpg|thumb|Example of a music manuscript: [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], ''Sonata for Violin Solo'', BWV 1001]]

One or several RISM working groups in more than 35 countries take part in the project. Around 100 individuals from those working groups [[Library catalog|catalogue]] the musical sources preserved in their countries. They pass their results on to the RISM Zentralredaktion (Central Editorial Office) in [[Frankfurt am Main]], where the entries are edited and published.&lt;ref&gt;International Association of Music Libraries (IAML): [http://www.iaml.info/r-projects Joint projects and assisted publications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302170740/http://www.iaml.info/en/activities/joint_projects |date=2015-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RISM Zentralredaktion and the working groups in Germany are projects funded by the [[Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur | Academy of Sciences and Literature]] in [[Mainz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adwmainz.de/projekte/repertoire-international-des-sources-musicales-rism-zentralredaktion-frankfurt/informationen.html Academy of Sciences and Literature, Mainz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314183157/http://www.adwmainz.de/index.php?id=142&amp;no_cache=1&amp;sword_list=RISM |date=2012-03-14 }} (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The other working groups receive independent funding in their own countries.

== Publications ==
RISM publications are divided into the following series:&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed list of publications, see the [http://www.adwmainz.de/fileadmin/adwmainz/MuKo_Publikationen/PV-RISM.pdf RISM List of Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Series A: arranged by composer
* Series B: arranged by topic
* Series C: index of [[music library|music libraries]] 
In addition to these, working groups conduct projects to document libretti surviving in their respective countries.

== RISM Series A/I – Printed Music ==
RISM Series A/I ''Individual Prints before 1800'' documents [[History of music publishing|printed music]] of works by a single composer published between 1500 and 1800. Collected prints (anthologies of works by various composers) are published in RISM series B.

Each individual entry contains the following information:
* Name of [[composer]]
* An [[Opus number|opus]] or [[Opus number#Catalogues|catalogue number]] if there is one
* Title of the print
* [[Sheet music|Format]] – e.g. score, [[Part (music)|parts]] or [[piano reduction]]
* Place of publication
* Publisher
* Year of publication, if possible
* List of libraries where is the item preserved

Series A/I is available through the RISM online catalog, after having appeared in print and as a [[CD-ROM]].&lt;ref name=printed&gt;"Printed Music (A/I and B/I) now in RISM's Online Catalog," http://www.rism.info/en/home/newsdetails/browse/3/article/64/printed-music-ai-and-bi-now-in-risms-online-catalog.html&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the stated intention of opening the way to the primary source for [[Musicologist|researchers]] and [[Musician|performers]], this sort of catalogue provides attractive possibilities for other areas of [[Research|interest and inquiry]] as well. For example, one can gain insight into many different topics while researching the reception of a [[Musical composition|piece]]. One way could be to find out how the music of a [[composer]] was regarded after his death; to find this out, it would be important to know how many and which of his works were [[Reprint|reissued]].

Over 78,000 printed editions by 7,616 [[composers]] (arranged alphabetically) from 2,178 [[libraries]] were documented in the nine volumes of the series (published 1971–1981). Four supplementary volumes appeared between 1986 and 1999, and in 2003, an index volume followed listing [[Publishing|publishers]], printers, [[Music engraving|engravers]] and places of publication. All volumes of RISM series A/I were published by [[Bärenreiter]] in [[Kassel]]. The [[CD-ROM]] was published by Bärenreiter-Verlag at the end of 2012, and the CD-ROM data were incorporated into the online catalog in 2015.

== RISM Series A/II – Music Manuscripts ==
RISM series A/II ''Music Manuscripts after 1600'' lists only [[Music manuscript|handwritten]] music. They are described in detail according to a uniform scheme containing more than 100 fields. There are currently more than 917,000 entries on pieces by around 27,000 composers available (as of November 2015, and the number is constantly increasing). The total number of music manuscripts extant worldwide is many times that large.

The entries are currently from more than 900 [[Library|libraries]] in 37 countries: [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Mexico]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], [[Uruguay]], [[Ukraine]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Venezuela]]. This makes RISM’s [[database]] by far the most extensive accessible set of records in the field.

The RISM database has been available free of charge online since June 2010. Access to this online catalog is through the Internet via the RISM online catalog or the RISM website. The catalogue was made possible through cooperation between RISM, the [[Bavarian State Library]] (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek), and the [[Berlin State Library]] (Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin). The CD-ROM version of the accumulated database produced and published by [[K. G. Saur Verlag|K. G. Saur]] in [[Munich]] was discontinued in 2008. The subscription database hosted by [[EBSCO Industries|EBSCO]] (formerly by NISC) is still available.

The catalogue entries describe each piece in detail. Included are, among other things, information about the composer (including dates of birth and death), title, [[Instrumentation (music)|performing forces]], as well as references to musicological literature. The manuscripts themselves are described in detail with respect to [[copyist]], place and time of origin, librettist, previous owners, and dedicatees. In addition, many works can also be identified by means of a music [[incipit]], that is, the opening notes or measures from important movements or sections of a piece.

A variety of search boxes enables browsing and discovery through any of these fields. Specific questions can be answered by combining specific indexes. For example, it is possible to immediately access all the information stored by RISM about [[Mass (music)|masses]] by [[Joseph Haydn]]. 
A search by means of a musical incipit is a valuable research tool when trying to identify an anonymous piece or a fragment of a piece. To make use of this tool, the researcher keys in the first few notes of the work.

The database provides information not only about the dissemination of works by composers who are still well known today, but also a wealth of knowledge about those many creative musicians who were highly regarded in their day, but are currently either little known, or even forgotten. This makes the database invaluable for music historians, and also makes it possible for performing musicians to “excavate” and rediscover many things.

== RISM Series B ==
RISM series B comprises a systematic series which documents a self-contained group of [[Primary source|sources]]. The volumes in series B are published by [[G. Henle Verlag|G. Henle]] of [[Munich]].

{{main|List of RISM abbreviations}}
RISM uses a series of abbreviations to identify different libraries and conservatories where manuscripts are located. For example, "I-MOe" means "Italy-Biblioteca Estense Universitaria, [[Modena]]."

== People who use the RISM publications ==
* [[Musicologist]]s looking for sources connected with their field of research find a basis for exploring catalogues of works and modern editions;&lt;ref&gt;"The present writer is grateful to record again a debt to ''RISM'' for directing him to four early tablatures for guitar and cittern, lying unrecognized in a small Swiss library--a discovery that marks one of the most substantial additions to the 16th-century instrumental repertory in many years." Daniel Heartz, "The Répertoire International des Sources Musicales," ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'' 14 (1961): 271.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Performers who discover a vast wealth of little-known pieces for concerts off the beaten musical path;
* [[Librarian]]s who can explore sources that complement the holdings of their own libraries;
* [[Students]] who need to consult primary sources for an assignment or term paper;
* Music antiquarians who can look up information about other copies of pieces they are offering.

'''Sagittarius '''is one of the [[constellations]] of the [[zodiac]]. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century [[astronomer]] [[Ptolemy]] and remains one of the [[88 modern constellations]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for the [[archery|archer]], and its symbol is [[File:Sagittarius.svg|20px]] ([[Unicode]] U+2650 ♐), a stylized arrow. Sagittarius is commonly represented as a [[centaur]] pulling-back a bow. It lies between [[Scorpius]] and [[Ophiuchus]] to the west and [[Capricornus]] and [[Microscopium]] to the east.

The center of the [[Milky Way]] lies in the westernmost part of Sagittarius (see [[Sagittarius A]]).

{{anchor|Teapot}}&lt;!-- Teapot (asterism) redirects to this section --&gt;
[[File:Sagittarius-teapot-asterism.jpg|300px|thumbnail|left|The "Teapot" asterism is in Sagittarius. The Milky Way is the "steam" coming from the spout.]]
As seen from the northern hemisphere, the constellation's brighter stars form an easily recognizable [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as 'the [[Teapot]]'. The stars [[Delta Sagittarii|δ Sgr]] (Kaus Media), [[Epsilon Sagittarii|ε Sgr]] (Kaus Australis), [[Zeta Sagittarii|ζ Sgr]] (Ascella), and [[Phi Sagittarii|φ Sgr]] form the body of the pot; [[Lambda Sagittarii|λ Sgr]] (Kaus Borealis) is the point of the lid; [[Gamma2 Sagittarii|γ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Sgr]] (Alnasl) is the tip of the spout; and [[Sigma Sagittarii|σ Sgr]] (Nunki) and [[Tau Sagittarii|τ Sgr]] the handle. These same stars originally formed the bow and arrow of Sagittarius.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bowandarrow.htm  Star Tales: The Bow and Arrow of Sagittarius]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marking the bottom of the teapot's "handle" (or the shoulder area of the archer), are the bright star (2.59 magnitude) [[Zeta Sagittarii]] (ζ Sgr), named [[Ascella]], and the fainter [[Tau Sagittarii]] (τ Sgr).

To complete the teapot metaphor, under good conditions, a particularly dense area of the [[Milky Way]] can be seen rising in a north-westerly arc above the spout, like a puff of steam rising from a boiling kettle.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Chen (Sky Publishing 2007) A Constellation Album: Stars and Mythology of the Night Sky ({{ISBN|978-1931559386}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The constellation as a whole is often depicted as having the rough appearance of a stick-figure archer drawing its bow, with the fainter stars providing the outline of the horse's body.  Sagittarius famously points its arrow at the heart of [[Scorpius]], represented by the reddish star [[Antares]], as the two constellations race around the sky.  Following the direct line formed by [[Delta Sagittarii]] (δ Sgr) and [[Gamma2 Sagittarii]] (γ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Sgr) leads nearly directly to Antares. Fittingly,  Gamma2 Sagittarii is [[Alnasl]], the Arabic word for "arrowhead", and Delta Sagittarii is called [[Kaus Media]], the "center of the bow," from which the arrow protrudes. Kaus Media bisects [[Lambda Sagittarii]] (λ Sgr) and [[Epsilon Sagittarii]] (ε Sgr), whose names Kaus Borealis and Kaus Australis refer to the northern and southern portions of the bow, respectively.&lt;ref name=Ridpath&gt;{{cite book|last=Ridpath|first=Ian|title=Star Tales|year=2018|publisher=Lutterworth Press|isbn=978-0718894788|pages=154–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable features ==
=== Stars ===
[[File:SagittariusCC.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The constellation Sagittarius. North is to the left. The line going to the right connects ζ to α and β Sagittarii. Above this line one sees [[Corona Australis]].]]
[[Alpha Sagittarii|α Sgr]] (Rukbat, meaning "the archer's knee"&lt;ref name=Chartrand&gt;{{cite book|last=Chartrand III|first=Mark R.|title=Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers|year=1983|publisher=Golden Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-307-13667-1|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;) despite having the "alpha" designation, is not the brightest star of the constellation, having a magnitude of only 3.96 (not shown on the main map as it is located below the map's southeastern corner, north is up).  Instead, the brightest star is [[Epsilon Sagittarii]] (ε Sgr) ("Kaus Australis," or "southern part of the bow"), at magnitude 1.85.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Kaler, Prof. Emeritus of Astronomy, University of Illinois, http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/sowlist.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigma Sagittarii]] (σ Sgr) ("Nunki") is the constellation's second-brightest star at magnitude 2.08. Nunki is a B2V star approximately 260 light years away.&lt;ref name=Chartrand /&gt; "Nunki" is a [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] name of uncertain origin, but thought to represent the sacred Babylonian city of [[Eridu]] on the [[Euphrates]], which would make Nunki the oldest star name currently in use.&lt;ref name=Ridpath /&gt;

[[Zeta Sagittarii]] (ζ Sgr) ("Ascella"), with apparent magnitude 2.61 of A2 spectra, is actually a double star whose two components have magnitudes 3.3 and 3.5.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=David|title=The Henry Holt Guide to Astronomy|year=1978|publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group, Ltd.|location=New York, NY|isbn=0805011978|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Delta Sagittarii]] (δ Sgr) ("Kaus Meridionalis"), is a K2 spectra star with magnitude 2.71 and only 85 light years from Earth.&lt;ref name=Baker /&gt;

[[Eta Sagittarii]] (η Sgr) is a double star with component magnitudes of 3.18 and 10, while [[Pi Sagittarii]] (π Sgr) ("Albaldah")&lt;ref name="IAU-LSN"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/ | title=Naming Stars |publisher=IAU.org |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is actually a triple system whose components have magnitudes 3.7, 3.8, and 6.0.&lt;ref name=Baker /&gt;

The Bayer designation [[Beta Sagittarii]] (Beta Sgr, β Sagittarii, β Sgr) is shared by two star systems, β¹ Sagittarii,  with apparent magnitude 3.96, and β² Sagittarii, magnitude 7.4. The two stars are separated by 0.36° in the sky and are 378 light years from earth. Beta Sagittarii, located at a position associated with the forelegs of the centaur, has the traditional name [[Arkab]], meaning "achilles tendon."

[[Nova]] Sagittarii 2015 No. 2 was discovered on 15 March 2015,&lt;ref name="Nova" /&gt; by {{not a typo|John Seach}} of Chatsworth Island, NSW, Australia. It lies near the center of the constellation. It reached a peak magnitude of 4.3 before steadily fading.

=== Deep-sky objects ===
[[File:Omega Nebula.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|The Omega Nebula, also known as the Horseshoe or Swan Nebula]]
The [[Milky Way]] is at its densest near Sagittarius, as this is where the [[galactic center]] lies. As a result, Sagittarius contains many [[star cluster]]s and [[nebula]]e.

==== Nebulae ====
Sagittarius contains several well-known nebulae, including the [[Lagoon Nebula]] (Messier 8), near λ Sagittarii; the [[Omega Nebula]] (Messier 17), near the border with [[Scutum (constellation)|Scutum]]; and the [[Trifid Nebula]] (Messier 20), a large nebula containing some very young, hot stars.

* The Lagoon Nebula](M8) is an emission nebula that is located 5,000 light-years from Earth and measures 140 light-years by 60 light-years ([[celestial sphere|1.5°]]). Though it appears grey in telescopes to the unaided eye, long-exposure photographs reveal its pink hue, common to emission nebulae.&lt;ref name="Wilkins Dunn 2006" /&gt; It is fairly bright, with an integrated magnitude of 3.0.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=108}} The Lagoon Nebula was discovered independently by [[John Flamsteed]] in 1680,{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=109}} [[Guillaume Le Gentil]] in 1747,&lt;ref name="Wilkins Dunn 2006" /&gt; and [[Charles Messier]] in 1764.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=109}} The central area of the Lagoon Nebula is also known as the Hourglass Nebula, so named for its distinctive shape. The Hourglass Nebula has its shape because of matter propelled by [[Herschel 36]]. The Lagoon Nebula also features three [[dark nebula]]e catalogued in [[Barnard's Catalog]].&lt;ref name="Wilkins Dunn 2006" /&gt; The Lagoon Nebula was instrumental in the discovery of [[Bok globules]], as [[Bart Bok]] studied prints of the nebula intensively in 1947. Approximately 17,000 Bok globules were discovered in the nebula nine years later as a part of the [[Palomar Sky Survey]]; studies later showed that Bok's hypothesis that the globules held [[protostar]]s was correct.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=111–112}}
* The Omega Nebula is a fairly bright nebula, sometimes called the Horseshoe Nebula or Swan Nebula.  It has an integrated magnitude of 6.0 and is 4890 light-years from Earth. It was discovered in 1746 by [[Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux|Philippe Loys de Chésaux]]; observers since him have differed greatly in how they view the nebula, hence its myriad of names. Most often viewed as a checkmark, it was seen as a swan by [[George Frederick Chambers|George F. Chambers]] in 1889, a loon by [[Roy Bishop]], and as a curl of smoke by [[Camille Flammarion]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=103}}
* The Trifid Nebula (M20, NGC 6514) is an emission nebula in Sagittarius that lies less than two degrees from the Lagoon Nebula. Discovered by French comet-hunter [[Charles Messier]], it is located between 2,000 and 9,000 light-years from Earth and has a diameter of approximately 50 light-years. The outside of the Trifid Nebula is a bluish [[reflection nebula]]; the interior is pink with two dark bands that divide it into three areas, sometimes called "lobes". Hydrogen in the nebula is ionized, creating its characteristic color, by a central triple star, which formed in the intersection of the two dark bands.&lt;ref name="Wilkins Dunn 2006" /&gt; M20 is associated with a cluster that has a magnitude of 6.3.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=114}}
* The [[Red Spider Nebula]] (NGC 6537) is a planetary nebula located at a distance of about 4000 light-years from Earth.
* [[NGC 6559]] is a star-forming region located at a distance of about 5000 light-years from Earth, in the constellation of Sagittarius, showing both emission (red) and reflection (blue) regions.

In addition, several other nebulae have been located within Sagittarius and are of interest to astronomy.

* [[Messier 24|M24]], also called the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud, is a star cluster with an approximate magnitude of 3. About 9400 light-years away, it has a diameter of approximately 330 light-years. Embedded in M24 is [[NGC 6603]], a smaller star cluster that is very dense. [[NGC 6567]], a dim [[planetary nebula]], and [[Barnard 92]], a [[Bok globule]], are also nearby.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=143–144}}
* [[NGC 6445]] is a [[planetary nebula]] with an approximate magnitude of 11. A large nebula at over one [[arcminute]] in diameter, it appears very close to the [[globular cluster]] [[NGC 6440]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=133}}
* [[NGC 6638]] is a dimmer globular at magnitude 9.2, though it is more distant than M71 at a distance of 26,000 light-years. It is a Shapley class VI cluster; the classification means that it has an intermediate concentration at its core. It is approximately a degree away from the brighter globulars [[Messier 22|M22]] and [[Messier 28|M28]]; NGC 6638 is southeast and southwest of the clusters respectively.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=167–168}}

In 1999 a violent outburst at [[V4641 Sagittarii|V4641 Sgr]] was thought to have revealed the location of the closest known black hole to Earth,&lt;ref name="nrao" /&gt; but later investigation increased its estimated distance by a factor of 15.&lt;ref name="SAX" /&gt; The complex radio source [[Sagittarius A]] is also in Sagittarius, near its western boundary with [[Ophiuchus]]. Astronomers believe that one of its components, known as [[Sagittarius A*]], is associated with a [[supermassive black hole]] at the [[Galactic Center|center of the galaxy]], with a mass of 2.6 million [[solar mass]]es.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=143}} The [[Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy]] is located just outside the [[Milky Way]].

[[Baade's Window]] is an area with very little [[dust lane|obscuring dust]] that shows objects closer to the Milky Way's center that would normally be visible. [[NGC 6522]], magnitude 8.6, and [[NGC 6528]], magnitude 9.5, are both globular clusters visible through Baade's Window. 20,000 and 24,000 light-years from Earth, with Shapley classes of VI and V respectively, both are moderately concentrated at their cores. NGC 6528 is closer to the galactic core at an approximate distance of 2,000 light-years.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=174–175}}

[[2MASS-GC02]], also known as '''Hurt 2''', is a [[globular cluster]] at a distance of about 16 thousand [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]]. It was discovered in 2000 by Joselino Vasquez, and confirmed by a team of astronomers under the leadership of R. J. Hurt at [[2MASS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2MASS-GC02, Hurt 2|url=http://spider.seds.org/spider/MWGC/2mass-gc02.html|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exploration ==
The [[space probe]] [[New Horizons]] is moving on a trajectory out of the Solar System as of 2016 that places the probe in front of Sagittarius as seen from the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/16oct_kbos/&lt;/ref&gt;  New Horizons will exhaust its [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] long before it reaches any other stars.

The [[Wow! signal]] was a strong narrowband radio signal that appeared to have come from the direction of Sagittarius.

== Mythology ==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Sagittarius and Corona Australis, Microscopium, and Telescopium.jpg|thumb|300px|Sagittarius as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825]]
The Babylonians identified Sagittarius as the god [[Nergal]], a strange centaur-like creature firing an arrow from a bow.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; It is generally depicted with wings, with two heads, one panther head and one human head, as well as a scorpion's stinger raised above its more conventional horse's tail. The Sumerian name [[Pabilsaĝ|Pabilsag]] is composed of two elements&amp;nbsp;– Pabil, meaning 'elder paternal kinsman' and Sag, meaning 'chief, head'. The name may thus be translated as the 'Forefather' or 'Chief Ancestor'.&lt;ref name="White 2008 p155" /&gt; The figure is reminiscent of modern depictions of Sagittarius.

=== Greek mythology ===
In [[Greek mythology]], Sagittarius is usually identified as a [[centaur]]: half human, half horse. However, perhaps due to the Greeks' adoption of the Sumerian constellation, some confusion surrounds the identity of the archer.&lt;ref name=Ridpath /&gt;  Some identify Sagittarius as the centaur [[Chiron]], the son of [[Philyra (mythology)|Philyra]] and [[Cronus]], who was said to have changed himself into a horse to escape his jealous wife, [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], and tutor to [[Jason]]. As there are two centaurs in the sky, some identify Chiron with the other constellation, known as [[Centaurus]].&lt;ref name=Ridpath /&gt; Or, as an alternative tradition holds, that Chiron devised the constellations Sagittarius and Centaurus to help guide the Argonauts in their quest for the Golden Fleece.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Allen (1899), Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning, G. E. Stechert, p. 353 {{OCLC|30773662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A competing mythological tradition, as espoused by [[Eratosthenes]], identified the Archer not as a centaur but as the [[satyr]] [[Krotos|Crotus]], son of [[Pan (god)|Pan]], who Greeks credited with the invention of archery.&lt;ref name=Ridpath /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theony Condos, Ph.D. (Red Wheel/Weiser 1997) Star Myths of the Greeks and Romans: A Sourcebook, p. 186 ({{ISBN|9781609256784}}.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to myth, Crotus often went hunting on horseback and lived among the [[Muses]], who requested that [[Zeus]] place him in the sky, where he is seen demonstrating archery.&lt;ref name=Ridpath /&gt;

The arrow of this constellation points towards the star [[Antares]], the "heart of the scorpion", and Sagittarius stands poised to attack should Scorpius ever attack the nearby [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], or to avenge Scorpius's slaying of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].&lt;ref&gt;Milton D. Heifetz (Cambridge University Press 2004) A Walk Through the Heavens: A Guide to Stars and Constellations and Their Legends, p. 66 ({{ISBN|9780521544153}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Astrology ===
{{main|Sagittarius (astrology)}}

{{as of|2002}}, the Sun appears in the constellation Sagittarius from 18 December to 18 January. In [[tropical astrology]], the Sun is considered to be in the sign Sagittarius from 22 November to 21 December, and in [[sidereal astrology]], from 16 December to 14 January.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5602">A '''Small Learning Community''' ('''SLC'''), also referred to as a '''School-Within-A-School''', is a [[school organizational models|school organizational model]] that is an increasingly common form of [[learning environment]] in [[United States|American]] [[secondary school]]s to subdivide large school populations into smaller, autonomous groups of students and teachers.  SLCs can also be physical [[learning space]]s.

The primary purpose of restructuring secondary schools into SLCs is to create a more [[personalized learning]] environment to better meet the needs of students.&lt;ref name="AFA"&gt;''Architecture for Achievement - building patterns of small school learning'', Victoria Bergsagel, Tim Best, Kathleen Cushman, Lorne McConachie, Wendy Sauer, David Stephen.  Mercer Island, WA.  1997.  Page 101-104.  {{ISBN|978-0-9796777-0-0}}.  Retrieved 2016-04-07&lt;/ref&gt; Each community will often share the same teachers and student members from grade to grade. Teachers in these units usually have common planning time to allow them to develop interdisciplinary projects and keep up with the progress of their shared students.

==Types==
SLCs can take several forms.

* Theme-Based Smaller Learning Communities or Focus Schools are usually formed around a specific curricular theme.  Examples might include "Success Academy" or "Humanities".
* Houses may be themed or non-themed or separated by grade levels.
* Career Academies are generally a three- or four-year structure developed around a career theme or [[Career Clusters]].  Characterized by career-related electives and integration of career theme across entire academic curriculum.
* Freshman Academies are structure designed to support 9th grade students as they transition into high school.
* Magnet Schools are a career-themed SLC that includes accelerated course-work for Gifted &amp; Talented students.

== Courses ==
Core courses include:

* SLC Portfolio

* SLC Honors World History I: Prehistory - 1500
* SLC Honors World History II: 1500 - Present
* SLC Honors United States History (or SLC Honors European History)

* SLC Honors Geometry
* SLC Honors Algebra II
* SLC Honors Statistics
* SLC Honors Biology: Ecological &amp; Molecular (E/M)
* SLC Honors Chemistry
* SLC Honors Environmental Science: Practical &amp; Experimental (P/E)
* SLC Heart of Advanced Science (In some schools, this course is called "SLC Integrated Advanced Sciences")
* SLC Honors English I
* SLC Honors English II
* SLC Completion of Advanced English (In some schools, this course is called "SLC Honors English III")

Electives include:

* SLC Language Enrichment (French, Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, Chinese, Russian or German; depending on school)
* SLC Ethics and Philosophy
* SLC Theory of Knowledge (may not be available in most SLC schools; effective 2019)
* SLC Modern Technology
* SLC Computer Sciences
* SLC Arts
* SLC Music Theory
* SLC Design
* SLC Psychology
* SLC Reading and Writing Lab

Other courses:

* Bridge to SLC 
** This is a course for students in grade 8 admitted to SLC in the following year of high school. This prepares students in the structure of SLC with maths, humanities, sciences, and English with an advanced level of preparation. The class conjoins all courses spread in weeks.

'''Solar viewer''' (also known as '''solar viewing glasses''' or '''solar eclipse glasses''') is special [[eyewear]] designed for direct viewing of the [[Sun]]. Standard [[sunglasses]] are unable to filter out eye damaging radiation. Solar viewers are required for safe viewing of solar events such as [[solar eclipse|eclipses]]. The recommended [[Absorbance|optical density]] of this eyewear is 5.

==Safety==
According to the [[American Astronomical Society]] (AAS) products meeting the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 12312-2 standard avoids risk damage, and issued a list of reputable vendors of eclipse glasses. The organization warned against products claiming ISO certification, or even citing the exact standard number, but not tested by an accredited laboratory, or those bearing incomplete certification information. Another problem was counterfeits of reputable vendors' products, some even claiming the company's name (such as with American Paper Optics which published information detailing the differences between its glasses and counterfeits).&lt;ref name = APO&gt;{{cite web|title=Eclipse Glasses Safety|url=https://www.eclipseglasses.com/pages/safety|website=Eclipse Glasses.com|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AmericanAstronomicalSociety2017&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eclipse.aas.org/eye-safety/iso-certification|title=How to Tell If Your Eclipse Glasses or Handheld Solar Viewers Are Safe|date=February 23, 2017|work=Solar Eclipse Across America – August 21, 2017|publisher=American Astronomical Society|access-date=August 20, 2017|language=en}} Includes photos of genuine and fake eclipse glasses.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyewear made prior to 2015, may have a 3 year use limit before they can no longer effectively filter out UV radiation. Starting in 2015, products made with ISO 12312-2 can be used indefinitely as long as they have not been damaged by scratch or tear.&lt;ref name="live_Will"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Will Your Solar Eclipse Glasses Still Be Safe to Use in 2024?| author = Weisberger, Mindy| work = Live Science| date = 2017-08-25| accessdate = 2017-08-28| url = https://www.livescience.com/60237-do-solar-eclipse-glasses-expire.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterfeit eclipse glasses===
In the months leading to the [[solar eclipse of August 21, 2017]], counterfeits of light-filtering glasses for solar eclipses began proliferating, leading to [[public health]] issues. Effective eclipse glasses filter visible, ultraviolet, ''and'' infrared light.&lt;ref name="quartz-fakeglasses"/&gt; The eye's retina lacks pain receptors, and thus damage could occur without one's awareness.&lt;ref name=AmericanAstronomicalSociety2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9news.com/mobile/article/news/eclipse/heres-how-fast-your-retina-could-burn-looking-at-eclipse-unprotected/281-465395218 |title=Here's How Fast Your Retina Could Burn Looking at Eclipse Unprotected |publisher=[[KUSA (TV)|9 News]] |location=Denver, Colorado |first=Travis |last=Pittman |date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAS said determining whether an eclipse viewer was safe required a [[Spectrophotometry|spectrophotometer]] and lab equipment, but often the user should see nothing through the filter except for the Sun, sunlight reflecting off of shiny metal, or intense light sources such as an LED flashlight.&lt;ref name="cbc-amazonrecall"/&gt;

Andrew Lund, the owner of a vendor of eclipse glasses, noted that not all counterfeit glasses were necessarily unsafe.  He stated to ''[[Quartz (website)|Quartz]]'' that the counterfeits he tested blocked the majority of harmful light, concluding that "the IP is getting ripped off, but the good news is there are no long-term harmful effects."&lt;ref name="quartz-fakeglasses"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1040159/solar-eclipse-glasses-for-sale-on-amazon-may-not-meet-nasa-safety-recommendations/|title=Solar-eclipse fever means counterfeit glasses are flooding Amazon's market|last=Wolfson|first=Elijah|work=Quartz|access-date=August 19, 2017|date=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2017, Amazon required all eclipse viewing products sold on its website have a submission of origin and safety information, and proof of an accredited ISO certification. In mid-August 2017, Amazon recalled and pulled listings for eclipse viewing glasses that "may not comply with industry standards", and gave refunds to customers who had purchased them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-tell-if-your-solar-eclipse-glasses-are-safe-or-fake/|title=How to tell if your solar eclipse glasses are safe or fake|work=CNET|access-date=August 19, 2017|first=Matt|last=Elliott|date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc-amazonrecall"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/amazon-solar-eclipse-glasses-1.4247740|title=Amazon offers refunds to customers who bought fake eclipse glasses|work=CBC News|access-date=August 19, 2017|date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13267">There are several approaches to defining the substance and scope of '''technology policy'''.

According to the American scientist and policy advisor [[Lewis M. Branscomb]], technology policy concerns the "public means for nurturing those capabilities and optimizing their applications in the service of national goals and interests".&lt;ref name="branscomb1995"&gt;Branscomb, L. M. (1995). Confessions of a Technophile. Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; Branscomb defines [[technology]] in this context as "the aggregation of capabilities, facilities, skills, knowledge, and organization required to successfully create a useful service or product".&lt;ref name="branscomb1995" /&gt;

Other scholars differentiate between technology policy and [[science policy]], suggesting that the former is about "the support, enhancement and development of technology", while the latter focuses on "the development of science and the training of scientists".&lt;ref&gt;Dodgson, M., &amp; Bessant, J. (1997). Effective innovation policy: A new approach. Long Range Planning, 30(1), 143.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rigas Arvanitis, at the Institut de Recherche pour le développement (IRD) in France, suggests that "science and technology policy covers all the public sector measures designed for the creation, funding, support and mobilisation of scientific and technological resources".&lt;ref name="arvanitis"&gt;Arvanitis, Rigas. Science and technology policy. Eolss Publishers Company Limited, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology policy is a form of 'active [[industrial policy]]', and effectively argues, based on the empirical facts of technological development as observed across various societies, industries and time periods, that markets rarely decide industrial fortunes in and of their own and state-intervention or support is required to overcome standard cases of market-failure (which may include, for example, under-funding of Research &amp; Development in highly competitive markets).&lt;ref name="borris&amp;stowsky1997"&gt;Borris, M. &amp; Stowsky, J. (1997). Technology Policy and Economic Growth. Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy. UC Berkeley: Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology policy may be more broadly defined. [https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/faculty-a-z/michael-pollitt/ Michael G. Pollitt] offers a [[multidisciplinary approach]] with social science and humanities perspective on "Good" policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=G.|first=Pollitt, M.
 |date=2015-12-02|title=In Search of 'Good' Energy Policy: The Social Limits to Technological Solutions to Energy and Climate Problems|url=https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.5797|language=en|doi=10.17863/cam.5797|publisher=Apollo
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological determinism==
[[Technological determinism]] presumes that a society's [[technology]] drives the development of its social structure and cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M.R. and Marx, L., 1994. Does technology drive history?: The dilemma of technological determinism. Mit Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is believed to have been coined by [[Thorstein Veblen]] (1857–1929), an American sociologist and economist. The most radical technological determinist in the United States in the 20th century was most likely [[Clarence Ayres]] who was a follower of [[Thorstein Veblen]] and [[John Dewey]]. [[William Ogburn]] was also known for his radical technological determinism.

Viewed through the lens of [[Science policy]], public policy can directly affect the funding of [[capital equipment]], intellectual infrastructure for industrial research, by providing tax incentives, direct funding or indirect support to those organizations who fund, and conduct, research. [[Vannevar Bush]], director of the office of scientific research and development for the U.S. government in July 1945, wrote "Science is a proper concern of government"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm Vannevar Bush (July 1945), "Science, the Endless Frontier"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Vannevar Bush directed the forerunner of the [[National Science Foundation]], and his writings directly inspired researchers to invent the [[hyperlink]] and the [[computer mouse]].  The [[DARPA]] initiative to support computing was the impetus for the [[Internet Protocol]] stack. In the same way that scientific consortiums like [[CERN]] for [[high-energy physics]] have a commitment to public knowledge, access to this public knowledge in physics led directly to CERN's sponsorship of development of the [[World Wide Web]] and standard Internet access for all.

The first major elaboration of a technological determinist view of socioeconomic development came from the German philosopher and economist [[Karl Marx]], whose theoretical framework was grounded in the perspective that changes in technology, and specifically [[Productive forces|productive technology]], are the primary influence on human social relations and organizational structure, and that social relations and cultural practices ultimately revolve around the technological and economic base of a given society. Marx's position has become embedded in contemporary society, where the idea that fast-changing technologies alter human lives is all-pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith &amp; Marx|first= Merrit Roe &amp; Leo |title= Does Technology Drive History? The Dilemma of Technological Determinism|publisher= The MIT Press|date=June 1994|isbn= 978-0262691673}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although many authors attribute a technologically determined view of human history to Marx's insights, not all Marxists are technological determinists, and some authors question the extent to which Marx himself was a determinist. Furthermore, there are multiple forms of technological determinism.&lt;ref name="Karl Marx and the Three Faces of Technological Determinism, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bimber|first=Bruce|title=Karl Marx and the Three Faces of Technological Determinism|journal=Social Studies of Science|date=May 1990|volume=20|issue=2|pages=333–351|doi=10.1177/030631290020002006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of technology as a means to liberation or enslavement, a question arising from a technological determinist perspective, David E. Cooper wrote in the Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement 38:7-18 (1995), "people myopically impressed by the world as an object of beauty or worship die out. Those who are myopically impressed by it as a source of energy do not: they even prosper." &lt;ref name="Cooper, D. (1995). Technology: Liberation or Enslavement?"&gt;Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement, 38, 7-18. doi:10.1017/S1358246100007256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology policy and economics==
Technology policy takes an 'evolutionary approach' to technical change, and hereby relates to evolutionary growth theory, developed by [[Luigi Pasinetti]], J.S. Metcalfe, Pier Paolo Saviotti, and Koen Frenken and others, building on the early work of [[David Ricardo]].&lt;ref&gt;Pasinetti, Luisi 1981 Structural change and economic growth, Cambridge University Press. J.S. Metcalfe and P.P. Saviotti (eds.), 1991, ''Evolutionary Theories of Economic and Technological Change'', Harwood, 275 pages. J.S. Metcalfe 1998, ''Evolutionary Economics and Creative Destruction'', Routledge, London. Frenken, K., Van Oort, F.G., Verburg, T., Boschma, R.A. (2004). ''Variety and Regional Economic Growth in the Netherlands – Final Report'' (The Hague: Ministry of Economic Affairs), 58 p. (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | doi = 10.1007/s00191-007-0081-5 | title = Export variety and the economic performance of countries | year = 2008 | last1 = Saviotti | first1 = Pier Paolo | last2 = Frenken | first2 = Koen | journal = [[Journal of Evolutionary Economics]] | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–218 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J.S. Metcalfe]] noted in 1995 that "much of the traditional economic theory of technology policy is concerned with so-called 'market failures' which prevent the attainment of Pareto equilibria by violating one or other of die conditions for perfect competition".&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe, J.S., 1995. Technology systems and technology policy in an evolutionary framework. Cambridge Journal of Economics, 19(1), pp.25-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the evolutionary paradigm, classic [[political science]] teaches technology as a static 'black box'. Similarly [[Neoclassical economics]] treats technology as a residual, or exogenous factor,  to explain otherwise inexplicable growth (for example, shocks in supply that boost production, affecting the equilibrium price level in an economy). In the United States, the creation of the U.S. [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] responded to the need policy approaches wherein not all technologies were treated as identical based on their social or economic variables.  Technology policy is distinct from [[science studies]] but both have been influenced by [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]]. Research in the technology policy domain recognizes the importance of, amongst others, [[Vannevar Bush]], [[Moses Abramovitz]], [[William J. Abernathy]] and [[James M. Utterback]].

Technology policy approaches Science as the pursuit of verifiable or falsifiable hypotheses, while science studies has a [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] view whereby science is not thought to get at an objective reality. Technology policy is rarely post-modern. Its goal is the improvement of policy and organizations based on an evolutionary view, and understanding, of the underlying scientific and technological constraints involved in economic development, but also their potential. For example, some [[clean coal technology|clean coal technologies]] via carbon sequestration and the allocation of electromagnetic spectrum by auction are ideas that emerged from technology policy schools. The [[Dominant design]] paradigm, developed by [[William J. Abernathy]] and [[James M. Utterback]], is an idea with significant implications for innovation, market structure and competitive dynamics both within and between nations that emerged from empirical research in [[Technology management]], a domain of Technology Policy.

==Plot summary==
Squire Eudoric Damberson of Zurgau in the kingdom of Locania wishes to wed Lusina, the daughter of his former tutor, the magician Doctor Baldonius. The price is attaining the status of knight and supplying the magician with a portion of dragon hide for use in his magic. Dragons are locally scarce, so Eudoric and his trusty servant Jillo set out for Pathenia in the east to slay one. But once the two do manage to bring one down (by accident) they face legal complications for violating the local game laws. Returning, Eudoric finds his promised bride has run off with a minstrel, and his feudal lord Baron Emmerhard disinclined to knight him for his heroic exploit; he consoles himself by pursuing a scheme to establish a stagecoach line like those in Pathenia. (This material first appeared as the short story "Two Yards of Dragon").

A subsequent rescue of Emmerhard from a magic spell finally secures him the knighthood, but he remains unlucky in love, as the baron's daughter Gerzilda also shuns his hand. (This material first appeared as the short story "The Coronet").

Next Eudoric pursues Maragda, daughter of Rainmar, a local robber baron who has been raiding his coach line. Rainmar tasks him with slaying the giant spider Fraka, and once again matters go awry. While Eudoric's knightly reputation and stage line prosper, his marriage prospects remain nil. (This material first appeared as the short story "Spider Love").

The pattern is repeated when he is commissioned to capture a unicorn for his ultimate overlord Emperor Thorar IX of the New Napolitanian Empire, intended as a gift for the visiting Grand Cham Gzik of Pantorozia. The emperor's daughter Petrilla, smitten with Gzik, weds the Cham instead. (This material first appeared as the short story "Eudoric's Unicorn").

Seeking to extend his stage line into Letitia, capital of the kingdom of Franconia that borders the empire to the west, his reputation for getting things done leads to him being deputed to rescue King Clothar's sister Yolanda, held captive in the rude neighboring realm of Armoria. There he is forced to save her from a sea monster and then wed her, after which he flees back to Franconia with his new bride. He finds her a less than congenial mate — Yolanda is both a control freak and an enchantress. Fighting with each other and dangers along the way, they encounter the restless ghost of a king cursed to endure eternal boredom in his tomb, an orthodox ogre who kills and eats those of the wrong faith, and the soldiers of the hostile duchy of Dorelia.

Nor are Eudoric's difficulties left behind on their return to Letitia. Mewed up as a prisoner in all but name in his princess bride's mansion by her supernatural servants, he soon discovers she is a female [[Bluebeard]] who regularly collects husbands and petrifies them as she tires of them. By calling on the aid of Dr. Tsudai, a Serican sorcerer whose life he had saved during his earlier stay in Letitia, Eudoric is ultimately successful in freeing his three predecessor-husbands from statuehood and escaping their lethal spouse.

Safe back in Locania, where his nuptials are not recognized, Eudoric receives a message from Yolanda pleading for him to return, as he is the only one of her husbands whose loss she regrets. He prudently ignores her letter, choosing instead to resume his courtship of his original intended, Lusina — she is also back, having grown disillusioned with her unreliable lover. Meanwhile, he and Dr. Baldonius hatch plans to incorporate his coach line as a limited liability company after the fashion of the [[Hong (business)|hongs]] of Serica.

==Setting==
''The Incorporated Knight'' and its sequel ''[[The Pixilated Peeress]]'' are both set in the medieval era of an alternate world sharing the geography of our own, but in which a "Napolitanian" ([[Naples|Neapolitan]]) empire filled the role of Rome and no universal religion like Christianity ever arose, leaving its nations split among competing pagan sects. The New Napolitanian Empire of which Eudoric is a subject roughly corresponds to our world's [[Holy Roman Empire]], or [[Germany]], while Franconia and Armoria, the lands he visits to the west, are the equivalents of [[France]] and [[Brittany]], respectively. The geography of more eastern regions such as Pathenia and Pantorozia are borrowed in part from the fanciful regions portrayed in ''[[John Mandeville|Mandeville's Travels]]''; the time-period corresponds to the historical 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Laughlin | first=Charlotte |author2=Daniel J. H. Levack  | title=De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography | location=San Francisco | publisher=Underwood/Miller | year=1983 | page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the character of de Camp's fantasy world as a cognate of our own, its place names tend to echo those of the real world. Examples include Franconia, equating to France but derived from the historic German [[Duchy of Franconia|region of the same name]]; Armoria, based on [[Armorica]], an ancient name for Brittany; [[Serica]], an ancient name for [[China]] or [[Xinjiang]]; Sogrambrium, the capital of the New Napolitanian Empire, derived from the [[Sicambri|Sicrambri or Sugambri]], an ancient Germanic tribe located on the east bank of the [[Rhine]] near the present border of [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]]; and Letitia, the capital of Franconia, a variation on [[Lutetia]], the ancient name of [[Paris]].

==Reception==
Reviews were favorable. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', noting that "[t]he hallmark of Sprague de Camp's classic fantasy has been a wry humor as he asked commonsensical questions of the genre's imaginative but impractical motifs," called this book, "the adventures of ... a knight whose only goals are a wife and a decent living," "[m]inor de Camp but still most enjoyable,"&lt;ref&gt;"The Incorporated Knight" (Review). ''Publishers Weekly'', v. 232, no. 10, September 4, 1987, pp. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jackie Cassada, writing for ''[[Library Journal]]'', praised its "doughty and resourceful hero and ... generous dollop of the de Camps' boisterous humor."&lt;ref&gt;Cassada, Jackie. "de Camp, L. Sprague &amp; Catherine Crook de Camp. The Incorporated Knight" (Review). ''Library Journal'', v. 112, no. 17, October 15, 1987, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Roland J. Green|Roland Green]], in ''[[Booklist|The Booklist]]'', called the book "a pleasant fantasy romp," noting that while it was "likely to be released in paperback in due time," its "high quality definitely makes [it] worth considering in hardcover."&lt;ref&gt;Green, Roland. "Science Fiction" (Review). ''The Booklist'', v. 84, no. 5, November 1, 1987, p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other works==
The main plot device of bickering male and female protagonists not destined for a happy ending together is featured in several late de Camp novels, notably ''[[The Prisoner of Zhamanak]]'' (1982), ''[[The Bones of Zora]]'' (1983), and ''[[The Pixilated Peeress]]'' (1991).

The '''Ship for Southeast Asian and Japanese Youth Program''' (東南アジア青年の船 ''Tōnan-ajia-seinen-no-fune''&lt;sup&gt;[[Help:Installing Japanese character sets|?]]&lt;/sup&gt;), commonly referred to as '''The Ship for Southeast Asian Youth Program''' and '''SSEAYP''' {{IPAc-en|s|j|ɑː|p|audio=SSEAYP_name.ogg}}, {{IPAc-en|s|iː|ˈ|j|ɑː|p}} {{respell|see|YAHP}}, is an annual youth exchange program organised by the Cabinet Office of Japan and governments of Southeast Asian countries for the purpose of promoting friendship and mutual understanding among the youths of eleven Southeast Asian countries and Japan, to broaden their perspective on the world, and furthermore, to strengthen their spirit of international cooperation and practical skills for international collaboration. Since its inception in 1974, the program has organised 41 international voyages attended by youth delegations sent by governments of respective members.

Four cruiseships have been deployed by the CaO for the journeys.

== Purpose ==
The Purpose of SSEAYP is to promoting friendship and mutual understanding among the youths of the ten Southeast Asian countries and Japan, to broaden their perspective on the world, and furthermore, to strengthen their spirit of international cooperation and practical skills for international collaboration.

== History ==
SSEAYP is an annual programme sponsored by the Japanese Cabinet Office and supported by the member-countries of ASEAN And an ASEAN observer Timor Leste. The programme brings together more than 300 youth from ASEAN countries Japan, providing them with the unique opportunity to live together on board the ship ''Nippon Maru'' for over 40 days.

SSEAYP started in January 1974 based on Joint Statements issued between Japan and the five ASEAN countries, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Brunei Darussalam joined in 1985. Vietnam participated in the programme in 1996 while the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]] and [[Myanmar]] participated in 1998, [[Cambodia]] in 2000.

In [[Māori mythology]], '''Tiki''' is the [[List of protoplasts|first man]] created by either [[Tūmatauenga]] or [[Tāne]]. He found the first woman, [[Marikoriko]], in a pond; she seduced him and he became the father of [[Hine-kau-ataata]]. By extension, a '''tiki''' is a large or small wooden or stone carving in humanoid form, although this is a somewhat archaic usage in the [[Māori language]]. Carvings similar to tikis and coming to represent [[Ancestor worship|deified ancestors]] are found in most [[Polynesian culture]]s. They often serve to mark the boundaries of sacred or significant sites.

==Religion==
In traditions from the West Coast of the [[South Island]] of New Zealand, the first human is a woman created by [[Tāne]], god of forests and of birds. Usually her name is Hine-ahu-one. In other legends, Tāne makes the first man Tiki, then makes a wife for him. In some [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] versions, Tiki himself, as a son of [[Rangi and Papa]], creates the first human by mixing his own blood with clay, and Tāne then makes the first woman. Sometimes [[Tūmatauenga]], the war god, creates Tiki.&lt;ref&gt;Tūmatauenga, god of war, represents man, as does Tāne, whose name means 'man'&lt;/ref&gt; In another story the first woman is [[Mārikoriko]]. Tiki marries her and their daughter is [[Hine-kau-ataata]].&lt;ref&gt;(White 1887-1891, I:151-152)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John White attributes this version to Ngāti Hau&lt;/ref&gt;  In some traditions, Tiki is the penis of Tāne (Orbell 1998:178, Tregear 1891:510-511). In fact, Tiki is strongly associated with the origin of the reproductive act.&lt;ref&gt;According to Reed, 'it is certain that Tiki... has a definite [[phallic]] significance' (1963:52). However Te Rangi Hiroa (Sir Peter Buck) pointed out that such references were only found in one late and controversial source (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

In one story of Tiki among the many variants, Tiki was lonely and craved company. One day, seeing his reflection in a pool, he thought he had found a companion, and dove into the pool to seize it. The image shattered and Tiki was disappointed. He fell asleep and when he awoke he saw the reflection again. He covered the pool with earth and it gave birth to a woman. Tiki lived with her in serenity, until one day the woman was excited by an [[eel]]. Her excitement passed to Tiki and the first reproductive act resulted (Reed 1963:52).

===Names and epithets===
John White names several Tiki or perhaps manifestations of Tiki in Māori tradition:&lt;ref&gt;(White 1887-1891, I:142)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tiki-tohua, the progenitor of birds&lt;ref&gt;In this story, Tiki-tohua was an egg produced by Hine-ahu-one, a woman made by Tāne to be his wife. This egg gave rise to all the birds (Shortland 1882:22).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tiki-kapakapa, the progenitor of fish and of a bird, the [[tui (bird)|tui]]&lt;ref&gt;Tiki-kapakapa (born after Tiki-tohua) was a girl who later took the name Hine-a-tauira. She and Tāne had a daughter named Hine-titamauri who was given to Tiki as his wife (Shortland 1882:22)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tiki-auaha, the progenitor of humanity
* Tiki-whakaeaea, the progenitor of the [[Sweet potato|kūmara]].

===Elsewhere in Polynesia===
[[File:Tiki statue shop 2, Hawaii, 1959.jpg|thumb|left|Tiki statue shop, [[Hawaii]]]]
The word appears as ''tiki'' in [[Māori language|New Zealand Māori]], [[Cook Islands Māori]], [[Tuamotuan language|Tuamotuan]], and [[Marquesan language|Marquesan]]; as ''ti{{okina}}i'' in [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], and as ''ki{{okina}}i'' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]. The word has not been recorded from the languages of Western Polynesia or in the [[Rapa Nui language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pollex.org.nz/entry/tiki.1/|title=Entries for TIKI.1 [CE] Carved human image|website=pollex.org.nz|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Hawaii]]an traditions the first man was Kumuhonua. He was made by [[Kāne]], or by Kāne, [[Kū]], and [[Lono]]. His body was made by mixing red earth with saliva. He was made in the shape of Kāne, who carried the earth from which the man was made from the four corners of the world. A woman was made from one of his ribs{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}. [[Kanaloa]] was watching when Kāne made the first man, and he too made a man, but could not bring him to life. Kanaloa then said to Kāne, “I will take your man, and he will die.” And so death came upon mankind (Tregear 1891:151).
* In [[Tahiti]], Ti{{okina}}i was the first man, and was made from red earth. The first woman was Ivi who was made from one of the bones (ivi) of Ti{{okina}}i (Tregear 1891:151) .
* In the [[Marquesas Islands]], there are various accounts. In one legend Atea and his wife created people. In another tradition Atanua and her father Atea brought forth humans (Tregear 1891:151).
* In the [[Cook Islands]], traditions also vary. At [[Rarotonga]], Tiki is the guardian of the entrance to Avaiki, the underworld. Offerings were made to him as gifts for the departing soul of someone who is dying. At [[Mangaia]], Tiki is a woman, the sister of Veetini, the first person to die a natural death. The entrance to Avaiki (the underworld) is called ‘the chasm of Tiki’ (Tregear 1891:151).
* According to [[Easter Island]] (Rapa Nui) legend, Hotu Matu'a, the first chief brought along a [[moai|mo{{okina}}ai]] (other traditional sources mention two) symbolizing ancestors, which became the model for the large mo{{okina}}ai. Dr. Jo Anne Van Tilburg of the Easter Island Statue Project at UCLA says that the first stone statues originated on Rapa Nui, although oral traditions do not support this and hers is just an opinion. Others contend that the first statues originated in the Marquesas or the [[Austral Islands]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6334">'''Timbral listening''' is the process of actively listening to the [[timbre|timbral]] characteristics of sound.

==Concept==
In timbral listening, 'pitch is subordinate to timbre'.  Instead, the specific quality of a musical tone is determined by considering 'the presence, distribution and relative [[amplitude]] of [[overtones]].'&lt;ref&gt;Süzükei, V., ''Listening The Tuvan Way'' in Levin, T., ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing, Sound, Music and Nomadism in Tuva and Beyond'' (Bloomington: Indiana University press, 2006) p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

When using this listening technique/ method of perception / interpretation there is 'a relation between timbre and [[Harmonic series (music)|spectral]] content which is analogous to that between pitch and [[frequency]] in that one is the prevalent cultural construct of the other'&lt;ref&gt;Waters, S., "Timbre Composition: Ideology, Metaphor and Social Process", Contemporary Music Review, 10:2 (1994), p133-134&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common form of timbral listening is listening to [[speech]]. This is demonstrated by listening to, for example, the vowels /a/ and /i/ spoken at the same [[pitch accent|pitch]] and intensity. The difference between the two sounds is entirely one of spectrum, or as the term is used in this article, [[timbre]].

==Nature==

It has been suggested that "timbral listening is an ideal sonic mirror of the natural world".&lt;ref&gt;Levin, T., ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing, Sound, Music and Nomadism in Tuva and Beyond'' (Bloomington: Indiana University press, 2006) p58&lt;/ref&gt; It is often (but not always) used in association with musics that are based in [[mimicry]] of sounds in the natural environment. [[Valentina Suzukei]] suggests that 'it was the [[nomadic]] way of life and its focus on the timbral qualities of natural sounds that created this kind of musicality'.&lt;ref&gt;Süzükei, V., ''Listening The Tuvan Way'' in Levin, T., ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing, Sound, Music and Nomadism in Tuva and Beyond'' (Bloomington: Indiana University press, 2006) p51.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially prevalent in Canada where composers such as [[Hildegard Westerkamp]] apply the thinking of [[R. Murray Schafer]]'s World [[Soundscape]] Project to their compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Landy, L., 'The Something to Hold on to Factor in Timbral Composition', "Contemporary Music Review" 10:2 (1994): 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptive language and notation==

As timbre has 'no domain-specific adjectives' it 'must be described in metaphor or by analogy to other senses',&lt;ref&gt;Fales, C., "The Paradox of Timbre", Ethnomusicology, 46:1 (Winter, 2002), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; This method also has limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, S., "Timbre Composition: Ideology, Metaphor and Social Process", Contemporary Music Review, 10:2 (1994), p131, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

*Traditional music in [[Tuva]] and other Turkic cultures of inner Asia
The composition of timbre-centered music in the nomadic communities of Tuva involves mimicry of sounds heard in the environment. Timbral listening is a fundamental component of listening to, understanding and being able to correctly perform this music using vocal techniques such as [[Overtone singing|throat singing]] "khoomei" and harmonic producing instruments such as the [[jaw harp]], bzaanchy, shoor, qyl qiyak, qyl-gobyz, ku-rai and [[igil]].

*[[Burundi|Barundi]] whispered [[Inanga (instrument)|Inanga]] or ''Inanga Chucotée'' in Africa
This music employs a fundamental [[Drone (music)|drone]] and overtone harmonics. It consists of "a whispered text, accompanied by the ''inanga'', a trough [[zither]] of eight strings. To listen correctly (using timbral listening), one must consider "the effect of the combined timbres of the noisy whisper and the inanga" as a whole sound.&lt;ref&gt;Fales, C., "The Paradox of Timbre", Ethnomusicology, 46:1 (Winter, 2002), 56&lt;/ref&gt;

*Some forms of contemporary electronic music
More recently, computers and [[synthesizers]] are being used by contemporary composers to produce timbral-centered music. Contemporary composers state timbral listening as the correct technique to adopt in listening to and analysing their timbre (as opposed to pitch) based compositions. 'Pure timbres' are explored using methods such as [[granular synthesis]] in works such as ''Dragon of the Nebula'' by [[Mara Helmuth]].&lt;ref&gt;Helmuth, M., "Timbral Composition and Gesture" Columbia University Music Department, available at {{cite web |url=http://meowing.memh.uc.edu/~mara/papers/TimbralCompGest.Greece92.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20020121195155/http://meowing.memh.uc.edu/~mara/papers/TimbralCompGest.Greece92.html |archivedate=2002-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Shakuhachi]] music in Japan
The music produced by the Shakuhachi end blown flute such as [[honkyoku]], contains timbral variations that are of equal importance to pitch variations. These timbral variations are indicated in [[Shakuhachi musical notation]].&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Donald Paul (Autumn, 1969). "The Shakuhachi and the Kinko Ryu Notation". Asian Music 1 (2): 32–72. Springer. {{doi|10.2307/833910}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

The technique of timbral listening is used by sound engineers to evaluate timbre difference.&lt;ref&gt;Quesnel, R., "Timbral Ear Trainer: Adaptive, Interactive Training of Listening Skills for Evaluation of Timbre Differences", paper presented at the 100th Audio Engineering Society Convention, Copenhagen, May 11th–14th, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Service Organizations Inc.''' ('''USO''') is a nonprofit organization that provides live entertainment, such as comedians and musicians, and other programs to members of the [[United States Armed Forces]] and their families. Since 1941, it has worked in partnership with the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]], and later with the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), relying heavily on private contributions and on funds, goods, and services from various corporate and individual donors. Although it is [[US Congress|congressionally]]-chartered, it is not a government agency.

During [[World War II]], the USO became the [[GI (military)|GI]]'s "home away from home" and began a tradition of entertaining the troops that continues today. Involvement in the USO was one of the many ways in which the nation had come together to support the war effort, with nearly 1.5 million people having volunteered their services in some way. After it was disbanded in 1947, it was revived in 1950 for the [[Korean War]], after which it also provided peacetime services. During the [[Vietnam War]], USOs were sometimes located in combat zones.

The organization became particularly famous for its live performances, called camp shows, through which the entertainment industry helped boost the morale of its servicemen and women. [[Hollywood]] in general was eager to show its patriotism, and many famous celebrities joined the ranks of USO entertainers. They entertained in military bases at home and overseas, sometimes placing their own lives in danger, by traveling or performing under hazardous conditions.

The USO has over 200 locations around the world in 14 countries (including the U.S.) and 27 states. During a gala marking the USO's 75th anniversary in 2016, retired Army Gen. [[George W. Casey Jr.]], the current chairman of the USO Board of Governors, estimated that the USO has served more than 35 million Americans over its history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gov/News-Article-View/Article/651462/from-world-war-ii-to-afghanistan-uso-marks-75th-anniversary "From World War II to Afghanistan: USO Marks 75th Anniversary"], Department of Defense, February 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pat-gallagher/uso-anniversary_b_9133132.html "Happy 75th Anniversary USO!"], ''Huffington Post'', February 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Mission and goals===
[[File:Uso-show-mickey-rooney.jpg|thumb|Actor [[Mickey Rooney]], a World War II Bronze Star recipient, honoring the USO in 2000]]

The USO was founded in 1941 by [[Mary Shotwell Ingraham|Mary Ingraham]] in response to a request from President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to provide morale and recreation services to U.S. uniformed military personnel. Roosevelt was elected as its honorary chairman. This request brought together six civilian organizations: the [[Salvation Army]], [[Young Men’s Christian Association]] (YMCA), [[Young Women’s Christian Association]] (YWCA), [[National Catholic Community Service]], [[National Travelers Aid Association]] and the [[National Jewish Welfare Board]]. They were brought together under one umbrella to support U.S. troops. Roosevelt said he wanted "these private organizations to handle the on-leave recreation of the men in the armed forces." According to historian Emily Yellin, "The government was to build the buildings and the USO was to raise private funds to carry out its main mission: boosting the morale of the military."&lt;ref name=Yellin&gt;Yellin, Emily. ''Our Mothers' War: American Women at Home and at the Front During World War II'', Simon and Schuster (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first national campaign chairman was [[Thomas Dewey]], who raised $16 million in the first year. The second chairman was future senator [[Prescott Bush]].&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt; The USO was incorporated in New York on February 4,&lt;ref name="USO Historical Timeline"/&gt; with the first facility erected in DeRidder, Louisiana,1941.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;John Whiteclay Chambers II. "USO." ''The Oxford Companion to American Military History''.

''High Hat Sam: The Life and Times of Louisiana Governor Sam Houston Jones''. Springfield, Missouri : James E. Cornwell, 2014. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; More USO centers and clubs opened around the world as a “Home Away from Home” for [[GI (military)|GIs]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The USO club was a place to go for dances and social events, for movies and music, for a quiet place to talk or write a letter home, or for a free cup of coffee and an egg.{{clarify|reason=Just an egg? Really?  And what would a GI do with that?|date=May 2018}}

The USO also brought [[Hollywood]] celebrities and [[Volunteering|volunteer]] entertainers to perform for the troops. According to movie historian Steven Cohan, "most of all ... in taking home on the road, it equated the nation with showbiz. USO camp shows were designed in their export to remind soldiers of home." They did this, he noted, by "nurturing in troops a sense of patriotic identification with America through popular entertainment."&lt;ref name=Cohan&gt;Cohan, Steven. ''The Road Movie Book'', Routledge (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''Look'' magazine at the time, stated, "For the little time the show lasts, the men are taken straight to the familiar Main Street that is the goal of every fighting American far away from home." [[Maxene Andrews]] wrote, "The entertainment brought home to the boys. ''Their'' home." Actor [[George Raft]] stated at the beginning of the war, "Now it's going to be up to us to send to the men here and abroad real, living entertainment, the songs, the dances, and the laughs they had back home."&lt;ref name=Cohan/&gt;

USO promotional literature stated its goals:

:"The story of USO camp shows belongs to the American people, for it was their contribution that made it possible. It is an important part in the life of your sons, your brothers, your husbands, and your sweethearts."&lt;ref name=Cohan/&gt;

===World War II===
[[Image:Hope WWII 44.jpg|thumb|[[Bob Hope]] USO show, 1944]]

After being formed in 1941, in response to World War II, "centers were established quickly... in churches, barns, railroad cars, museums, castles, beach clubs, and log cabins."&lt;ref name=Clairday&gt;Clairday, Robynn. ''Postcards from World War II'', Square One Publishers (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Most centers offered recreational activities, such as holding dances and showing movies. And there were the well-known free coffee and doughnuts. Some USO centers provided a haven for spending a quiet moment alone or writing a letter home, while others offered spiritual guidance and made childcare available for military wives.

But the organization became mostly known for its live performances called ''Camp Shows'', through which the entertainment industry helped boost the morale of its servicemen and women. USO Camp Shows, Inc. began in October 1941,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2uso.org/history.html WWII USO Preservation Association. ''History: USO Camp Shows, Inc.''], accessed 15 Dec 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and by that fall and winter 186 military theaters existed in the United States. Overseas shows began in November 1941 with a tour of the Caribbean. Within five months 36 overseas units had been sent within the Americas, the United Kingdom, and Australia, and during 1942 1,000 performed as part of 70 units. Average performers were paid $100 a week; top stars were paid $10 a day because their wealth let them contribute more of their talents.{{r|jstor3204158}}

These overseas shows were produced by the American Theatre Wing, which also provided food and entertainment for the armed services in their Stage Door Canteens. Funds from the sale of film rights for a story about the New York Canteen went toward providing USO tours of shows for overseas troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/history/perry.html |title=Who is 'Tony'? |publisher= The American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards®|website=TonyAwards.com |date=June 28, 1946 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Invasion of Normandy]] on June 6, 1944, [[Edward G. Robinson]] was the first movie star to travel to Normandy to entertain the troops.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Steven J., [http://www.usc.edu/vh/tfm/autumn-2011/little-caesar-and-the-mccarthyist-mob.1.html "Little Caesar and the McCarthyist Mob"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114232149/http://www.usc.edu/vh/tfm/autumn-2011/little-caesar-and-the-mccarthyist-mob.1.html |date=November 14, 2016 }}, USC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2d/6d/77/2d6d77eeb0ab767294a28c6d8d05b836.jpg|title=Photo of Edward G. Robinson entertaining troops in Normandy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had already been active back home selling war bonds, and donated $100,000 to the USO. During his show, he said, "This is the most privileged moment of my life, the opportunity to be here with you."&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Edward G. ''All My Yesterdays'', Hawthorn Books (1973) p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Camp Shows began in Normandy. 

Until fall 1944 overseas units contained five performers or fewer; ''[[The Barretts of Wimpole Street]]'', using local theaters in France and Italy, was the first to use an entire theater company, including scenery.{{r|jstor3204158}} At its high point in 1944, the USO had more than 3,000 clubs, and curtains were rising on USO shows 700 times a day. The USO's fundraising efforts were controversial. An [[MGM]] film, ''Mr. Gardenia Jones'', created to assist the USO in its fundraising campaign, was nearly withdrawn from theaters due to objections by the War Department, mainly because of scenes showing soldiers jumping with joy at the opportunity to shower in canteens and rest in overstuffed and comfortable USO chairs. The Army, noted the ''[[New York Times]]'', "feels this is not good for morale as it implies that there are no showers or other comforts for soldiers in military camps." The film starred [[Ronald Reagan]], then a captain in the [[United States Army Air Force|Army Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, Thomas. ''New York Times'', June 28, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundraising was also aided by non-USO entertainment groups. Soldier Shows, which troops – often experienced actors and musicians – organized and held their own performances, were common. The army formed a [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] unit that organized such shows and supervised the USO, and the experience from the Soldier Shows led to [[Irving Berlin]]'s Broadway show ''[[This Is the Army]]''. Performers and writers from throughout the army were recruited for the production; they remained soldiers and continued drills. Berlin, who had written and produced the similar ''[[Yip, Yip, Yaphank]]'' during World War I, took the entire 165-person cast on tour in Europe in 1942, raising nearly $10 million for the [[Army Emergency Relief]] Fund. The following year the show was made into a film by the same title, again starring Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt;{{r|jstor3204158}} One of the highlights of the film was its introduction of Berlin's song, "[[God Bless America]]," considered one of the nation's most patriotic songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|09Gj7mJbPPc|"God Bless America" sung by Kate Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''This Is The Army'' stage production toured worldwide until it closed in October 1945 in [[Honolulu]].{{r|jstor3204158}}

War correspondent [[Quentin Reynolds]], wrote in an article for ''[[Billboard magazine]]'' in 1943, that "Entertainment, all phases of it – radio, pictures and live – should be treated as essential. You don't know what entertainment means to the guys who do the fighting until you've been up there with the men yourself. [...] You can quote me as saying that we should use entertainment as an essential industry so long as it's for the boys in service. Anybody who has been there would insist on it.  [...] Hell, you should have seen how happy the G.I.'s were when they heard the ballplayers were coming over. And [[John Steinbeck]], just back from a chore as war correspondent, [...] also applauded show business as part of the war effort and its importance as a morale builder."&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vwwEAAAAMBAJ "Quentin Reynolds Talks on Terrific Job Big and Little Showbiz is Doing Overseas"], ''Billboard'', October 30, 1943 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Paul Holsinger, between 1941 and 1945, the USO did 293,738 performances in 208,178 separate visits. Estimates were that more than 161 million servicemen and women, in the U.S. and abroad, were entertained. The USO also did shows in military hospitals, eventually entertaining more than 3 million wounded soldiers and sailors in 192 different hospitals. There were 702 different USO troupes that toured the world, some spending up to six months per tour.&lt;ref name=Holsinger&gt;Holsinger, Paul. ''War and American Popular Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia'', Greenwood Publishing Group (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, a [[United States]] [[Liberty ship]] named the [[SS U.S.O.|SS ''U.S.O.'']] was launched. She was scrapped in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/116liberty_victory_ships/116facts1.htm Reading 1: Liberty Ships] ''[[National Park Service]] Cultural Resources.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-eight performers died in the course of their tours, from plane crashes, illness, or diseases contracted while on tour.&lt;ref name="jstor3204158"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matson | first1 = Lowell | last2 = | first2 = | year = 1954 | title = Theatre for the Armed Forces in World War II | journal = Educational Theatre Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | publisher = | doi = 10.2307/3204158 | jstor = 3204158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one such instance in 1943, a plane carrying a USO troupe crashed outside [[Lisbon]], killing singer and actress [[Tamara Drasin]], and severely injuring Broadway singer [[Jane Froman]]. Froman returned to Europe on crutches in 1945 to again entertain the troops. She later married the co-pilot who saved her life in that crash, and her story was made into the 1952 film ''[[With a Song in My Heart (film)|With a Song in My Heart]]'', with Froman providing the actual singing voice.&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;Goldstein, Richard.

[http://jolsonville.net/articles/world-war-ii-tours/ "Jolson Sings Again"], ''The Real Al Jolson'' (1950)&lt;/ref&gt;

One author wrote that by the end of the war "the USO amounted to the biggest enterprise American show business has ever tackled. The audience was millions of American fighting men, the theatre's location: the world, the producer: USO camp shows"&lt;ref name=Cohan/&gt; Performances continued after the end of the war in 1945. 60 new units went to Europe after [[V-E Day]], and 91 new units went to the Pacific after [[V-J Day]]. The USO dissolved in December 1947, after having spent $240 million in contributions on Camp Shows, canteens, and other services. Special Services productions grew in number as replacement.{{r|jstor3204158}}

In 1991, [[20th Century Fox]] produced the film, ''[[For the Boys]]'', which told the story of two USO performers, and starred [[Bette Midler]] and [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]]. It covered a 50-year timespan, from the USO's inception in 1941 through [[Operation Desert Storm]], in 1991. Another movie was planned in 1950 but never made. Just 10 days after [[Al Jolson]] returned from entertaining troops in Korea, he agreed with [[RKO]] producers to star in a new movie, ''Stars and Stripes for Ever,'' about a USO troupe in the South Pacific during World War II. Unfortunately, he died a week later as a result of physical exhaustion from his tour.

====Women in the USO====
[[File:USO Girls Airventure 2013.jpg|thumb|left|USO women from the World War II era ([[Historical reenactment|reenactment]])]]

According to Emily Yellin, many of the key foot soldiers in the USO's mission were women who were "charged with providing friendly diversion for U.S. troops who were mostly men in their teens and twenties."&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt; USO centers throughout the world recruited female volunteers to serve doughnuts, dance, and just talk with the troops. USO historian Julia Carson writes that this "nostalgic hour," designed to cheer and comfort soldiers, involved "listening to music – American style" and "looking at pretty girls, like no other pretty girls in the world – American girls."&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Julia. ''Home Away From Home: The Story of the USO'', Harper &amp; Brothers (1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

African-American women scrambled to rally the community around the soldiers and create programs for them. By 1946, hostesses had served more than two thousand soldiers a day while also providing facilities for the wounded and convalescent who were on leave. They went to black businesses and fraternal organizations in order to find sponsorship for their USO group, and later expanded to fulfill the needs of soldiers during the Korean War. Moreover, they worked to merge black and white USOs into one desegregated unit. As black historian Megan Shockley noted, "Their work for the desegregation of USOs had begun during World War II, and it finally paid off."&lt;ref&gt;Shockley, Megan Taylor. ''We, Too, are Americans: African American Women in Detroit and Richmond, 1940–55'', Univ. of Illinois Press (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were also key entertainers who performed at shows. Stars such as [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Betty Grable]] and [[Rita Hayworth]] had traveled over a million miles. Yellin notes that on one tour, Hayworth visited six camps, gave thousands of autographs, and "came back from Texas with a full-fledged nervous breakdown from over-enthusiasm!"&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt; Opera singer [[Lily Pons]], after she had performed a "serious" opera song to troops in [[Burma]], "an applause erupted that stunned even the most seasoned performers." She later wrote in a letter, "Every woman back home wears a halo now, and those who represent her had better keep theirs on, too."&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt;

Author Joeie Dee pointed out that "for women entertainers, traveling with the USO made it possible to be patriots and adventurers as well as professionals." She adds, however, that the G.I.s in the USO audiences "tended to see these women in a different light – as reminders of and even substitutes for their girls back home, as a reward for fighting the war, as embodiments of what they were fighting for."&lt;ref name=Dee&gt;Dee, Joeie. ''Hi GI'', Xulon Press (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Skvarna remembers 1943, when he met [[Donna Reed]] at a USO canteen and asked her to dance. "I had never danced with a celebrity before, so I felt delighted, privileged even, to meet her.... But I really felt she was like a girl from back home." Jay Fultz, author of a biography of Reed, states that soldiers "often wrote to her as if to a sister or the girl next door, confiding moments of homesickness, loneliness, privation and anxiety."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/25/arts/25donna.html?pagewanted=2&amp;th&amp;emc=th "Dear Donna: A Pinup So Swell She Kept G.I. Mail"], ''New York Times'', May 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women entertainers====
[[Image:USO Vietnam70.jpg|thumb|US Coast Guard, 1st show in Vietnam, 1970]]

One female entertainer wrote about conditions while performing:
{{quote|We've played to audiences, many of them ankle deep in mud, huddled under the ponchos in the pouring rain (it breaks your heart the first two or three times to see men so hungry for entertainment.) We've played on uncovered stages, when we, as well as the audience, got rain-soaked. We've played with huge tropical bugs flying in our hair and faces; we've played to audiences of thousands of men, audiences spreading from our very feet to far up a hillside and many sitting in the trees. ... We've played to audiences in small units of 500 or so, and much oftener to audiences of 8 to 10,000. Every night we play a different place.&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt;}}

Singer-actress-dancer [[Ann Miller]] described performing for badly wounded soldiers. She did forty-eight shows for "broken soldiers," who were mostly lying on stretchers in the lobbies of hotels, watching as she entertained them. Yellin writes, "During her last show she collapsed and had to be taken home on an Army airplane."&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt; Afterwards, Miller described the experience:

{{quote|We went from ward to ward to ward, singing and dancing and trying to boost the morale of these men. It was just hell. ... I just fell apart and I think the shock of seeing those men with their arms and legs blown off – it was just frightening. But when you do it, you do it. You try to help them, try to sing and dance. You try to keep their spirits up. It's heartbreaking.&lt;ref name=Yellin/&gt;}}

In November and December 1968 Jennie and [http://sedonasevenarcheslive.com/terrie-s-uso---veteran-connection.html Terrie Frankel] (the [[Doublemint Twins]]) performed in Vietnam with the USO – Hollywood Overseas Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/bib/78282|title=Terrie Maxine Frankel Collection|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were shepherded around Vietnam by escort officers (USO Performers were given GS15 ratings{{clarify|reason=What does that mean? And what does a rating have to do with safety?|date=May 2018}}, equivalent to Colonel, to help maintain their safety) to entertain troops in the field, where larger USO shows could not perform.

===Korean War===
[[File:Jolson-Korea.jpg|thumb|[[Al Jolson]], the first star to perform in Korea, September 17, 1950]]
In 1947, the USO was disbanded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uso.org/history.aspx/|title=The Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; due partly to lack of funds.&lt;ref name=Freedland&gt;Freedland, Michael. ''The Story of Al Jolson '' (1972), pp. 283–84&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, when the United States entered the Korean War, Secretary of Defense [[George Marshall]] and Secretary of the Navy [[Francis P. Matthews]] requested that the USO be reactivated "to provide support for the men and women of the armed forces with help of the American people." According to war historian Paul Edwards, Between 1952 and 1953, not a day went by without the USO providing services somewhere in Korea. At home or overseas, in 1952 it was serving 3.5 million in the armed forces using much the same methods of operation as it did in World War II.

Many stars, both well-known and new, came to perform, including [[Bob Hope]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Donald O'Connor]], [[Piper Laurie]], [[Jane Russell]], [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]], [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Rory Calhoun]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Jayne Mansfield]], [[Al Jolson#World War II and Korean War tours|Al Jolson]] and many others. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans#Military|Hispanic-American soldiers]] were entertained by artists such as [[Dámaso Pérez Prado|Pérez Prado]]'s Show featuring [[Evita Muñoz]] as his invited [[Mambo (dance)|mambo]] dancer. Jolson was the first to volunteer, but due to lack of USO funds traveled to Korea at his own expense&lt;ref&gt;Akst, Harry [http://jolsonville.net/articles/korean-war-tours/first-stop-tokyo/ "The Jolson Nobody Knew"], ''Cosmopolitan'', January 1951&lt;/ref&gt; (he was also the first to entertain troops during World War II).&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, S.J.

Veterans have recalled many of the USOs events, sometimes in vivid detail:

{{quote|On that cold, overcast day, there were more than five thousand troops in the audience. They sat on the ground or up on the hillside. When everyone was settled, [[Danny Kaye]] opened the show by going to the microphone, looking at his large audience, and shouting, "Who's holding back the enemy?" The GIs roared with laughter. We were thrilled to have Kaye and his entertainers in our area. We especially liked the young women in the show. Danny was okay, with his stories and jokes, but after all, we knew what American men looked like.&lt;ref name=Granfield&gt;Granfield, Linda. ''I Remember Korea: Veterans Tell Their Stories of the Korean War, 1950–53'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}}}}

Author Linda Granfield in describing the show, writes, "For two hours, the men could forget they were soldiers at war. After the show, they returned to the fighting in the hills. Some in that audience never made it back."&lt;ref name=Granfield/&gt; By the end of the war, over 113,000 American USO volunteers were working at 294 centers at home and abroad.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;Edwards, Paul M. ''The Korean War'', Greenwood Publishing Group (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; And 126 units had given 5,422 performances to servicemen in Korea and the wounded in Japan.

===Vietnam War===
The USO was in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] before the first combat troops arrived, with the first USO club opened in Saigon in April 1963. The 23 centers in Vietnam and [[Thailand]] served as many as a million service members a month, and the USO presented more than 5,000 performances during the [[Vietnam War]] featuring stars such as [[John Wayne]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Raymond Burr]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Martha Raye]], [[Joey Heatherton]], [[Wayne Newton]], [[Jayne Mansfield]], [[Redd Foxx]], [[Rosey Grier]], [[Anita Bryant]], [[Nancy Sinatra]], [[Jimmy Boyd]], [[Lola Falana]], [[George Peppard]] and [[Bob Hope]]. [[Philip Ahn]], the first actor of Korean descent to become a Hollywood star, became the first Asian American USO performer to entertain troops in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, Hye Seung. ''Hollywood Asian'', Temple Univ. Press (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thousands of service personnel listen to Miss Ann-Margret sing one of her numbers during her show in Danang, Vietnam. - NARA - 532506.tiff|thumb|px240|[[Ann-Margret]] performing in Vietnam, 1966]]
[[File:USO Show Vietnam 1968 Terrie Frankel, Sara Sue, 3 Soldiers, Jennie Frankel.jpg|thumb|USO Show Vietnam, 1968: Terrie Frankel, Sara Sue, Jennie Frankel, and three Soldiers]]

In addition, the USO operated centers at major U.S. airports to provide a lounge and place to sleep for American servicemen between their flights. Vietnam historian James Westheider noted that the USO "tried to bring a little America to Vietnam." Volunteer American civilians, who did 18-month tours, staffed the clubs. According to Westheider, "The young women wore miniskirts – no slacks were allowed." Each club had a snack bar, gift shops, a barbershop, photo developing, overseas phone lines, and hot showers.&lt;ref name=Westheider&gt;Westheider, James E. ''The Vietnam War'', Greenwood Publishing Group (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

When providing entertainment, the USO did its best to attract known stars from back home to help relieve the stresses of war. Senator [[John Kerry]] recalled how important this kind of diversion would become. He remembered a "Bob Hope Follies" USO show, which included actress [[Ann-Margret]], Miss America, football star [[Rosey Grier]], and others. According to Kerry biographer Douglas Brinkley, "When the Swift finally made it back to the My Tho River, the crew confronted the heartbreaking sight of a huge Navy landing craft ferrying the troops back. The USO show was over." Kerry later wrote, "The visions of Ann Margret and Miss America and all the other titillating personalities who would have made us feel so at home hung around us for a while until we saw three Chinook helicopters take off from the field and presumed that our dreams had gone with them."&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, Douglas. ''Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War'' HarperCollins (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

But for GIs who saw the show, it was worth it: "We turned to watch Ann perform, and for about two minutes of American beauty, the war was forgotten. Everyone fully understood just what was really worth fighting for. . . . The show was fantastic, but the escape the Bob Hope tour provided us in expectation for days before, and after, helped us keep in touch with what we were there for – God, Country, apple pie ... and Ann-Margret!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.war-stories.com/aspprotect/dn-poss-bob-hope-1966-2.asp War-Stories.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The visits by the stars meant a lot to the men and women in Vietnam. "It was not just the entertainment; it meant that they were not forgotten that far away from home," writes Westheider.&lt;ref name=Westheider/&gt; He adds that the tours made a "deep impression" on the stars as well. Singer and actress [[Connie Stevens]] remembered her 1969 tour with Bob Hope, when she decided to go despite the fact she had two children both under the age of two. Today, she claims that "veterans were still stopping her and thanking her for visiting Vietnam over 30 years later."&lt;ref name=Westheider/&gt;

Similarly, [[Ann-Margret]] during a book signing was approached by a veteran who asked her to sign a photo he took of her performing in Vietnam. Although the book's publishing representative for the signing event would not allow her to sign anything other than her book, the veteran's wife recalls:

{{quote|She took one look at the photo, tears welled up in her eyes, and she said, 'This is one of my gentlemen from Viet Nam and I most certainly will sign his photo. I know what these men did for their country and I always have time for 'my gentlemen.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://jdeaustcp.blogspot.com/2013/04/ann-margret-real-woman-of-year.html "Ann-Margret ... The Real WOMAN OF THE YEAR"], jdeaustocp blog, April 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In November–December 1968 the Sig Sakowitz troop from Chicago performed over 36 shows in South Vietnam with the USO in: Pleiku, Dalat, Danang, Cam Ran Bay, Phu Bai, Phu Loy, Hue, Natrang, Tan Son Nhut Airbase, Saigon and places in the boonies known only to military intelligence and the lonely soldiers yearning for a taste of home. The troop consisted of Doublemint Twins Terrie and Jennie Frankel, Gaslight Club singer Sara Sue, Comedian Tony Diamond and personality Sig Sakowitz. Shows were also performed with comedian Joey Bishop of the Rat Pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/story/loc.natlib.afc2001001.78282/ |title=Terrie Maxine Frankel: Digital Collection: Veterans History Project (Library of Congress) |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Peppard, successful star of stage, TV and motion pictures, arrived in Vietnam for a USO HANDSHAKE TOUR in 1970 to visit the military in the hospitals and out in the “boonies.” ...He showed a keen interest in the men’s mission while they were hungry for news of life back in the “World.” ... Polaroid pictures were taken by Mr. Peppard’s escort officer, autographed, and given to the men.&lt;ref&gt;Credit USO Photo/Vietnam&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, a bloody [[Lebanese civil war|civil war]] was raging in Lebanon. In an effort to stop the violence in the region a [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Multinational Force]] of [[Peacekeeping|peacekeeper]]s composed largely of U.S., Italian and French armed service members was created and sent to the region to attempt a restoration of order.

===Afghanistan and Iraq===
To support troops participating in Operations [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Enduring Freedom]] and [[Iraqi Freedom]], USO centers opened in [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Qatar]]. USO centers number more than 160 around the world. In those years, the USO opened centers at Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort Riley, Kansas; Fort Bliss, Texas; Fort Carson, Colorado; and Afghanistan. The USO provides a variety of programs and services, including orientation programs, family events, free Internet and e-mail access, free drinks and snacks, free phone calls home and recreation services. One of the newer programs, called "USO in a Box," delivers program materials ranging from DVD players and videos to musical instruments to remote forward operating bases in Afghanistan.

U.S. military personnel and their families visit USO centers more than eight million times each year.

The USO has provided services for the annual "[[Tribute to the Troops]]" special of [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]. They have aired WWE RAW from Afghanistan and Iraq every Christmas in the United States in a pre-taped show from the combat zone.

On July 16, 2012, Hollywood actor [[Charlie Sheen]] announced that he would donate at least $1 million to the USO. This would be among the largest single monetary donations ever given to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actor Charlie Sheen gives $1M to troops, USO|url=http://cnsnews.com/news/article/actor-charlie-sheen-gives-1m-troops-uso|publisher=CNS News|accessdate=July 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232422/http://cnsnews.com/news/article/actor-charlie-sheen-gives-1m-troops-uso|archive-date=October 4, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honoring Bob Hope==
In 1997, the U.S. Congress honored [[Bob Hope]] by declaring him the "first and only honorary veteran of the U.S. armed forces."&lt;ref&gt;[http://armylive.dodlive.mil/index.php/2014/08/bob-hope-first-and-only-honorary-veteran-of-the-armed-forces/ "Bob Hope: First and only honorary veteran of the Armed Forces"], ''Army Live'', August 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faith&gt;Faith, William. ''Bob Hope: A Life in Comedy'', Da Capo Press (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hope biographer William Faith, his reputation has become ingrained in the "American consciousness" because he had flown millions of miles to entertain G.I.s during both wartime and peace. His contribution to the USO began in 1941 and ended with [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Operation Desert Shield]] in 1991, spending 48 [[Christmas]]es overseas with American service personnel.&lt;ref name="MaroldaSchneller"/&gt; He was always treated as "an asset to the U.S. Government with his willingness to entertain whenever they needed him."&lt;ref name=Faith/&gt; After WWII was declared over, the USO had sent out an "impassioned bulletin" asking entertainers not to abandon the GIs now that the war was over. Hope was among the first to say yes. The [[Military Order of the Purple Heart]] notes that "his contributions to the USO are well known: they are legend."&lt;ref&gt;Military Order of the Purple Heart, ''Legacy of the Purple Heart'', 4th Ed., Turner Publishing Co. (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his non-stop entertainment to both the civilian population and the military, he received numerous other honors over the years: a [[C-17 Globemaster III|C-17 Air Force plane]] was named ''The Spirit of Bob Hope''; a naval vessel was named the ''[[USNS Bob Hope]]''; and streets, schools, hospitals, and a golf tournament were also named in his honor. A Senate resolution declared him "a part of American folklore." The ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' called him the most honored entertainer ever.  And during his 1993 televised birthday celebration, when he turned 90, [[General Colin Powell]] saluted Hope "for his tireless USO trouping", which was followed by onstage tributes from all branches of the armed forces. [[General William Westmoreland]] spoke about his loyalty to the GI throughout the gritty Vietnam years. And bandleader [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], who was with him during many of his tours, mentioned that his band "had seen more of Hope's ass in the last forty years than any of Hope's immediate family."&lt;ref name=Faith/&gt;

War correspondent Quentin Reynolds wrote in 1943, "He and his troupe would do 300 miles in a jeep, and give four shows... One of the generals said Hope was a first rate military target since he was worth a division; that that's about 15,000 men. Presumably the Nazis appreciated Hope's value, since they thrice bombed towns while the comic was there."&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt;

During the Vietnam War years he gave a number of high-rating television specials and sensed that the media had given him a broad endorsement for continuing on his GI mercy missions. Soon after his Christmas show in Saigon in 1967, he learned that the [[Vietcong]] had planned a terrorist attack at his hotel against him and his entire troupe, missing him by ten minutes. He was later "mystified," writes Faith, "and ... increasingly intolerant of the pockets of dissent. [[Draft-card burning]]s on college campuses angered him..." "Can you imagine," Hope wrote in a magazine article, "... that people in America are burning their draft cards to show their opposition and that some of them are actually rooting for your defeat?"&lt;ref name=Faith/&gt; In the spring of 1973, Hope began writing his fifth book, ''The Last Christmas Show'', which was dedicated to "the men and women of the armed forces and to those who also served by worrying and waiting." He signed over his royalties to the USO.

His final Christmas show was during [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Operation Desert Shield]] in 1990. The show was not easy, notes Faith. "There were so many restrictions. Hope's jokes were monitored by the State Department to avoid offending the Saudis... and the media was restricted from covering the shows... Because in Saudi Arabia national custom prescribes that women must be veiled in public, [[Ann Jillian]], [[Marie Osmond]], and the [[Pointer Sisters]] were left off Hope's Christmas Eve show."&lt;ref name=Faith/&gt;

In 2009, [[Stephen Colbert]] performing his last episode of weeklong taping in Iraq for his ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' show, carried a golf club on stage and dedicated it to [[Bob Hope]]'s service for the USO.

==Financial matters==
The USO has a paid staff of approximately 300. Additionally, more than 44,000 USO volunteers provide an estimated 371,417 hours of service annually. As reported by the USO, the unpaid volunteer to paid employee ratio overseas is 20 to 1. Within the United States, the number is "significantly higher."

The following information is based on USO's audited financial statements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uso.org/financial-statements.aspx|title=USO.org|publisher=|access-date=October 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930162941/http://www.uso.org/financial-statements.aspx|archive-date=September 30, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the year ended December 31, 2011:

==Cultural references==
[[Billy Joel]]'s song, "[[Allentown (song)|Allentown]]" (1982), includes the lines: "Well our fathers fought the Second World War/
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore/
Met our mothers in the USO/
Asked them to dance/
Danced with them slow."

From the 1979 film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'': "[[Viet Cong|Charlie]] didn't get much USO. He was dug in too deep or moving too fast. His idea of great R&amp;R was cold rice and a little rat meat. He had only two ways home: death, or victory."

The music video for the My Chemical Romance song, "The Ghost of You" is set at a USO dance. 

The climax of the 1999 ''South Park'' movie, ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut|South Park: Bigger, Longer, &amp; Uncut]]'', is set at a USO show.

{{main|Washington Redskins name controversy}}
Controversy over the name of the [[Washington Redskins]] has led to the use of [[Opinion poll|public opinion polling]] to establish whether the term "[[Redskin (slang)|redskin]]" is insulting to Native Americans, and whether it should be changed. Poll results show that a majority of the general population and a large majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name, and have criticized some scholars and Native American leaders as being erroneous, misleading, and indicative of [[white privilege]].

Louis Gray, president of the Tulsa Indian Coalition Against Racism and a member of the [[Osage Nation]], said in 2013, "You wouldn't [take a poll] with any other race. You wouldn't have African-Americans vote to decide whether or not any sort of racial epithet would be offensive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/blogs/sports/johnehoover/gray-redskins-is-a-slur-but-other-nicknames-objectify-native/article_b8559bf2-38c3-11e3-bb7a-0019bb30f31a.html|title= Gray: Redskins is a slur, but other nicknames objectify Native Americans|date=October 19, 2013|author=John E. Hoover|publisher=Tulsa World|accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polls of the general public==

===Opinions regarding name change===
While varying somewhat, national opinion polls consistently indicate that a majority of the general public do not advocate a name change.
*In an April 2013 poll by [[Associated Press|AP]]-[[GfK]], 79 percent responded that the name should not change, 11 percent said it should change, 8 percent had no opinion and 2 percent did not answer.&lt;ref name=Poll2013&gt;{{cite web |author=Ben Nuckols |title=US poll finds widespread support for Redskins name |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/us-poll-finds-widespread-support-redskins-name |website=AP News |accessdate=September 28, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505075719/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/us-poll-finds-widespread-support-redskins-name |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |deadurl=no |date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*A June 2014 poll by the [[Rasmussen Reports]], a polling company criticized by some as having a conservative bias, found 60 percent agreed that the name should not change, 26 percent that it should change, and 14 percent were undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/sports/june_2014/60_don_t_think_washington_redskins_should_change_their_name|title=60% Don't Think Washington Redskins Should Change Their Name|date=June 24, 2014|publisher=Rasmussen Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A poll conducted by Langer Research for [[ESPN]]'s "[[Outside the Lines]]" in September 2014 found 71 percent in favor of keeping the name, and 23 percent thinking the name should be changed. While finding no difference based upon race or gender, this poll found a significant political difference, with 88 percent of people who consider themselves conservative say the team should keep its name, compared to 53 percent for liberals.&lt;ref name="poll.9.2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/11451964/redskins-poll-most-favor-keeping-name-dissent-growing|title=Poll: 71 percent say keep Redskins|date=September 2, 2014|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The 2016 annual NFL poll found significant difference of opinion based upon age and race. Older respondents are opposed to a name change, but those between 18 and 29 are strongly (70%) in favor of a change. While 77% of all white fans believe the name should not be changed, only 38% of African-American and 33% of Latino fans agree, which is a change since the 2014 poll in which there was little difference between white and non-white opinion.&lt;ref name="Chuck Modiano"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/modiano-young-nfl-fans-change-washington-article-1.2544947| title=Hey, Dan Snyder: New poll shows young NFL fans want name change in Washington| publisher=NEW YORK DAILY NEWS| date=February 26, 2016| author=Chuck Modiano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinions regarding offensiveness of the name===
The September 2014 national poll found that 68 percent think the name is not disrespectful of Native Americans, 19 percent say it shows "some" disrespect, and 9 percent say it is "a lot" disrespectful.&lt;ref name="poll.9.2014"/&gt; This is in contrast to polls of DC, Maryland, and Virginia fans; a small majority of whom said that the word "redskin" is offensive to Native Americans in at least some contexts by 59 percent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=b41b9bde-1b19-40f7-af86-0b585eb8df03| title=Results of SurveyUSA News Poll #20802| date=October 15, 2013| accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 56 percent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/06/25/National-Politics/Polling/release_246.xml?44|title=Should the Washington Redskins change their name?|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=October 16, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 53 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wusa9.com/longform/sports/nfl/2014/09/25/nfl-washington-redskins-name-survey-dc-maryland-virginia-response/16098841/|title=DC Speaks: Keep Redskins name|author=Greg Cohen|publisher=WUSA|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polls targeting Native Americans==
Polls seeking to provide evidence of the opinion of Native Americans suffer from many limitations. First is the small size of the population, less than one percent of the total population of the United States. It takes months of sampling in order to gather a statistically significant sample. The most significant difficulty has been the problem of using self-identification as the only means of identifying Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Springwood, C. F.| date=2004| title=I'm Indian Too!": Claiming Native American Identity, Crafting Authority in Mascot Debates| journal=Journal of Sport &amp; Social Issues| volume=28| issue=1| pages=56–70| doi=10.1177/0193732503261477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not specific to the Redskins, a survey conducted in 2002 by [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|The Harris Poll]] for ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' (SI) found that 81 percent of Native Americans who live outside traditional Indian reservations and 53 percent of Indians on reservations did not find the names or images used by sports team to be discriminatory. The authors of the article concluded that "Although most Native American activists and tribal leaders consider Indian team names and mascots offensive, neither Native Americans in general nor a cross section of U.S. sports fans agree". According to the article, "There is a near total disconnect between Indian activists and the Native American population on this issue."&lt;ref name=PriceWoo&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.si.com/vault/2002/03/04/8100154/the-indian-wars-the-campaign-against-indian-nicknames-and-mascots-presumes-that-they-offend-native-americansbut-do-they-we-took-a-poll-and-you-wont-believe-the-results| author = S.L. Price| title = The Indian Wars| work = Sports Illustrated| date = March 4, 2002| pages=66–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the SI article, a group of five social scientists experienced in researching the mascot issue published a journal article arguing against the validity of this survey and its conclusions. They state, "The confidence with which the magazine asserts that a 'disconnect' between Native American activists and Native Americans exists on this issue belies the serious errors in logic and accuracy made in the simplistic labeling of Native Americans who oppose mascots as 'activists.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jss.sagepub.com/content/26/4/381|title=Of Polls and Race Predudice|DOI=10.1177/0193732502238255|journal=Journal of Sport and Social Issues|date=November 2002|volume=26|issue=4|page=381|author1=C.

===Annenberg 2004 poll===
The survey most frequently cited by opponents of change as definitive of Native American opinion was performed in 2004 as part of the [[National Annenberg Election Survey]]. Among other questions regarding election year issues, respondents who identified themselves as being Native American were asked: "The professional football team in Washington calls itself the Washington Redskins. As a Native American, do you find that name offensive or doesn't it bother you?" In response, ninety percent replied that the name did not bother them, while nine percent said that it was offensive, and one percent would not answer.&lt;ref name="Annenberg.20140927"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kathleen Hall Jamieson Ph.D. |title=Most Indians Say Name of Washington "Redskins" Is Acceptable While 9 Percent Call It Offensive |url=http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/most-indians-say-name-of-washington-redskins-is-acceptable-while-9-percent-call-it-offensive/ |website=The Annenberg Public Policy Center |accessdate=September 27, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014154005/http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/most-indians-say-name-of-washington-redskins-is-acceptable-while-9-percent-call-it-offensive/ |archivedate=October 14, 2013 |deadurl=no |date=September 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The methods used in this survey and the conclusions that can be drawn from it have been criticized by social scientists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Charles Springwood|title="I'M Indian Too!": Claiming Native American Identity, Crafting Authority in Mascot Debates|publisher=Journal of sport and social issues|date=February 2004|volume=28|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American scholars&lt;ref name="ClarkD.2005"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Indigenous Voice and Vision as Commodity in a Mass-Consumption Society: The Colonial Politics of Public Opinion Polling|author=D.

In August, 2015, a memo written by senior researchers at the organization responsible for collecting the data for the survey made clear that it should not be taken as an accurate reflection of Native American attitudes at the time.&lt;ref name="Abt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipclinic.org/2015/08/03/designers-of-that-2004-annenberg-survey-on-the-redskins-name-the-sample-was-unpresentative/|title=Designers of that 2004 Annenberg survey on the Redskins name: The sample was unrepresentative|date=August 3, 2015|publisher=Glushko-Samuelson Intellectual Property Law Clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative method to standard opinion polls was used by the Center for Indigenous Peoples Studies at [[California State University]], San Bernardino. A survey was conducted of 400 individuals, with 98 individuals positively identified as Native Americans, finding that 67% agreed with the statement that "Redskins" is racial or racist. The response from non-natives was almost the opposite, with 68% responding that the name is not racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lindseyadler/native-americans-offended-by-racial-slur|title=New Study Finds 67% Of Native Americans Find Redskins Name Offensive|publisher=Buzzfeed.com|date=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cips.csusb.edu/docs/PressRelease.pdf|format=PDF|title=Survey on Redskins team name found most American Indians believe it to be offensive and racist.|accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Washington Post'' 2016 poll===
In May 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (WaPo) released a poll of self-identified Native Americans that produced the same results as the 2004 Annenberg poll, that 90% of the 504 respondents were "not bothered" by the team's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/new-poll-finds-9-in-10-native-americans-arent-offended-by-redskins-name/2016/05/18/3ea11cfa-161a-11e6-924d-838753295f9a_story.html | title=New poll finds 9 in 10 Native Americans aren't offended by Redskins name | work=Washington Post | date=19 May 2016 | accessdate=19 May 2016 | author=Cox, John Woodrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/how-the-washington-post-conducted-the-survey-on-the-redskins-name/2016/05/19/98c0a4ae-1b8c-11e6-9c81-4be1c14fb8c8_story.html| title=How The Washington Post conducted the survey on the Redskins' name| author1=Scott Clement| author2=Emily Guskin| date=May 19, 2016| publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/washington-post-poll-of-native-americans-on-redskins-team-name/2032/| title=Washington Post poll of Native Americans on Redskins' team name - Survey conducted December 16, 2015 to April 12, 2016| accessdate=May 24, 2016| publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences between the 2004 and 2016 poll===
*The Annenberg poll was criticized for only using land lines at a time when they were rare on reservations, so 60% of the respondents in the new poll were contacted on cell phones, based upon other surveys indicating that 95% of Native Americans have at least one cell phone per household. When a land-line was answered, there was a request that the youngest adult present respond to the questions; for cell phones the individual answering the phone completed the survey.
*The new survey included Alaska and Hawaii, which have large populations of indigenous people, while the 2004 survey only included the contiguous 48 states.
*Sample selection: The new survey was part of the routine WaPo opinion survey, in which all were asked "Do you consider yourself white, black or African American, Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, mixed race or some other race?" Only those that responded that they were 100% Native American/Alaskan Native were then asked the questions about the Redskins. (However, 16% of the sample identified themselves as Hispanic.) They were also asked if they were enrolled members of a tribe, and if so which one; 44% of the respondents said they were tribal members. In addition, zip codes containing a high proportion of tribal or reservation land were targeted. Due to the low percentage of Native Americans in the general population, responses were collected over a five-month period, December 16, 2015 to April 12, 2016.
New questions included:
*Participants were asked if they had heard about the debate; 56% responded that they had heard "not too much" or "not at all". 78% said the debate was either "not too" or "not at all" important.
*80% responded that they would not be personally offended if a Non-Native American called them as a "Redskin".
*A smaller sample of 340 respondents was asked if the term "redskin" is disrespectful to Native Americans, with 73% responding "No".
*51% said they are pro football fans, while 48% were not, a split similar to national polls of all adults.

====Methodology====
Due to variations between the characteristics of the sample and the population of Native Americans based upon Census data from 2010, the reported results were based upon statistical weighting of the raw data. The respondents were older (274 of the 504 being over 50), more highly educated (at least some college), and more likely to live in the Northeast and North Central regions, compared to Native Americans in the Census. Criticism of the wording of the question "As a Native American, do you find that name offensive or doesn't it bother you?" as being confusing was addressed by asking the question again to 43 respondents to check that the same answer was given, which it was by 41 of the 43. However, the problem critics have with the question is that it is unclear what is being asked given that "do you find the name offensive" is distinct from "or doesn't it bother you", the later also being awkwardly worded.&lt;ref name="AULAW"/&gt; Reports of the results by the media, such as the [[Associated Press]], say Native Americans are "not offended" rather than "not bothered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/05/19/us/ap-fbn-redskins-poll.html?_r=0| title=Poll: 9 in 10 Native Americans Not Offended by Redskins Name| author=THE ASSOCIATED PRESS| date=May 19, 2016| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to 2016 poll===
[[Adrienne Keene]], [[Ed.D]] responded that the poll uses faulty data and methods, such as the continuing problem of self-identification, and the reporting of the results misses the point regarding objections to the name established by social science research and the authentic voices of Native Americans as being about real harms, not individual feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nativeappropriations.com/2016/05/wapos-new-redskns-survey.html| title=WaPo's new Redsk*ns survey: Faulty data and missing the point| author=Dr. Adrienne Keene, EdD| date=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCAI Executive Director Jacqueline Pata stated, "The survey doesn't recognize the psychological impacts these racist names and imagery have on American Indian and Alaska Natives. It is not respectful to who we are as Native people. This poll still doesn't make it right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ncai.org/news/articles/2016/05/19/ncai-response-to-new-poll-on-r-skins-team-name| title=NCAI Response to New Poll on R*skins Team Name | date=May 19, 2016| accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Native American Journalists Association]] (NAJA) issued a statement calling the publication of the poll, and the reporting of its significance, as not only inaccurate and misleading but unethical. "The reporters and editors behind this story must have known that it would be used as justification for the continued use of these harmful, racist mascots. They were either willfully malicious or dangerously naïve in the process and reporting used in this story, and neither is acceptable from any journalistic institution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.naja.com/news/m.blog/509/naja-and-unity-respond-to-recent-washington-nfl-team-name-poll| title=NAJA and UNITY respond to recent Washington NFL team name poll| date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not addressing the NAJA criticism, the WaPo editorial board continues to maintain its prior position that the name is a slur and that they will avoid its use as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/05/22/washington-post-follows-poll-with-call-for-name-change/| title=Washington Post follows poll with call for name change| author=Mike Florio| date=May 22, 2016| publisher=NBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one WaPo editor and advocate for change, Robert McCartney, has decided to drop any further protest in light of the poll results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/im-dropping-my-protest-of-washingtons-football-team-name/2016/05/19/b09e8e7e-1cfe-11e6-8c7b-6931e66333e7_story.html| title=I'm dropping my protest of Washington's football team name| author=Robert McCartney| date=May 20, 2013| publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Los Angeles Times'' editorial cites the evidence that the name is offensive to many, which the poll does not change given its questionable representation of Native American opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-ol-washington-redskins-racism-nfl-native-american-20160525-snap-story.html| title=Forget the poll: 'Redskin' offends, and the NFL should drop the name| author=Scott Martelle| date=May 25, 2016| newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World news''' or '''international news''' or even '''foreign coverage''' is the [[news media]] jargon for news from abroad, about a  country or a global subject. For [[journalism]], it is a branch that deals with news either sent by [[foreign correspondent]]s or [[news agency|news agencies]], or – more recently – information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as [[telephone]], [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] or the [[internet]].

Although in most of the [[English-speaking world]] this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and "national" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.

At the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign, as registered by the [[Newspaper|courants]] of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the ''Daily Courant'' (England), the ''Nieuwe Tijudinger'' ([[Antwerp]]), the ''Relation'' ([[Strasbourg]]), the ''Avisa Relation oder Zeitung'' ([[Wolfenbüttel]]) and the ''Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland &amp; C.'' ([[Amsterdam]]). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that [[nation-state]]s were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.

From the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the [[telegraph]] made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] (France), [[Reuters]] (UK), Wolff (currently [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]], Germany) and the [[Associated Press|AP]] (US).

[[War journalism]] is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).

== Foreign correspondents ==
{{Main|Correspondent}}

There are essentially two types of reporters who do foreign reporting: the '''foreign correspondent''' (full-time reporter employed by a news source) and the '''special envoy''' (sent abroad to cover a specific subject, temporarily stationed in a location).

The correspondent is a reporter based in a foreign city (often the capital of a country) covering a region, a country or sometimes even an entire continent. He or she regularly files stories to the news editor. He/she gathers materials for these stories from local officials, members of the community, and the local media, as well as from events he/she directly witnesses. Correspondents typically stay in touch with the local community and maintain contacts with other journalists and correspondents in order to identify strategic sources in the government, among diplomats, members of the military and other organizations on the ground who may provide important information.

The number of foreign correspondents has dropped significantly over the past 20 years or more. Often, a media company is either uninterested or unable to afford to support a single correspondent, such as in many developing countries. In some places, they cannot obtain visas due to political constraints, or otherwise dangerous conditions prohibit a media company from stationing a reporter there. In recent years, the drop in foreign correspondents has been due to cutbacks within media companies (often, but not always, a result of economics alone).[http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2010/network_tv_news_investment.php] Among English language newspapers, only eight daily newspapers have full-time correspondents in more than ten foreign stations, four from the US, three from the UK and one from India: 

35 – ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (US): Baghdad, Bangkok, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, London, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, São Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Zurich

24 – ''[[New York Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Caracas, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, São Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo

19 – ''[[Financial Times]]'' (UK): Beijing, Berlin, Bombay, Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

17 – ''[[Washington Post]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Berlin, Bogotá, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Shanghai, Tehran, Tokyo

15 – ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK): Accra, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Kabul, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Los Angeles, Madrid, New York, Paris, Rome, Tehran, Tokyo

13 – ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (UK): Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Kabul, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

13 – ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, New Delhi, Seoul

12 – ''[[The Hindu]]'' (India): Addis Ababa, Beijing, Colombo, Dhaka, Dubai, Islamabad, Kathmandu, London, Moscow, Paris, Singapore, Washington  

When reporters working abroad have no permanent labor contract with media outlets, they are called '''stringers'''. Since they have no salary, stringers usually produce material for several different companies at once.

== News agencies ==
{{Main|News agency}}
A '''news agency''' is an organization of [[journalist]]s established to supply [[news]] reports to news organizations: [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, and [[All-news radio|radio]] and [[News broadcasting|television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]]. Such an agency may also be referred to as a wire service, newswire or news service. The bulk of major news agency services contains foreign news.

The major news agencies generally prepare hard news stories and feature articles that can be used by other news organizations with little or no modification, and then sell them to other news organizations. They provide these articles in bulk electronically through wire services (originally they used [[telegraphy]]; today they frequently use the [[Internet]]). Corporations, individuals, analysts and [[intelligence agencies]] may also subscribe.
