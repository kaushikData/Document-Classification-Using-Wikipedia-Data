'''''Back to Work: Why We Need Smart Government for a Strong Economy''''' is a [[2011 in literature|2011]] [[non-fiction|non-fiction book]] by former [[POTUS|United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name=politico&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=MJ|title=Inside Bill Clinton's new book|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1111/67605.html|accessdate=November 15, 2011|newspaper=''[[The Politico]]''|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Praise appeared in publications such as the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and the ''New York Journal of Books'',&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; while publications such as ''[[The Guardian]]'' published more mixed reviews.&lt;ref name=tar/&gt;

==Contents==
Clinton writes that the American government faces considerable challenges that it is fundamentally struggling to deal with, problems affecting culture and society as well as the [[Economy of the United States|current economy]]. He argues that Americans "have to get back in the future business." He specifically blames a mindset articulated by [[Conservatism in the United States|ideological conservatives]] and their allies in the modern [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], particularly those connected to the [[Tea Party movement]], for emphasizing cutting [[government spending]] and lowering [[regulations]] over what he sees as pragmatic government actions that create [[economic growth]] and prosperity. Rather than having an inherently anti-government mindset that causes Americans to "hog-tie ourselves", Clinton states that they "need a strong, effective private sector and a strong, effective government that work together".&lt;ref name=politico/&gt;&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;

He describes various areas such as high-school graduations where the U.S. has fallen behind compared to other countries. Clinton concludes, "Over the last three decades, whenever we’ve given in to blame the government for all our problems, we’ve lost our commitment to shared prosperity, balanced growth, financial responsibility, and investment in the future." He criticizes both American parties for not being up to the task of fighting the [[Late 2000s recession|major economic slowdown]], though he writes from a lens of clear sympathy for President [[Barack Obama]] and the Congressional [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in the face of Republican opposition.&lt;ref name=politico/&gt;&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; "From 1981 to 2009," he writes, looking back to the economy pre-recession, "the greatest accomplishment of the anti-government Republicans was not to reduce the size of the federal government but to stop paying for it."&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

In terms of specific policies, Clinton advocates changes such as raising the [[Social Security (United States)#Taxation|cap on Social Security taxes]], reducing [[U.S. military|military-related]] spending, and reforming the payment system to medical providers in the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid (United States)|Medicaid]] programs.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; As well, he discusses fighting loopholes in the [[Internal Revenue Code|U.S. tax code]], citing how [[ExxonMobil]] made $10.7 billion in [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] during the second quarter of 2011 with an effective tax rate of only 17.6% (less than the average tax rate of 20.4% for individual Americans). He broadly writes in support of the viewpoints of the bipartisan [[National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform|Simpson-Bowles Commission]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

==Reviews and response==
''[[The Guardian]]'' published a mixed review, with author Erik Tarloff arguing that "the book is almost devoid of human interest or any hint of the man's vivid, outsize personality" but also that Clinton had sounded "informed, high-minded, intelligent and persuasive" in making policy recommendations. He viewed parts of the book as "deadly dull" with others "shrewd and convincing", and he claimed that only "in a country whose notionally conservative party has gone so far off the rails would anyone even have bothered to write it." Tarloff also wrote, "Everything in it is worthy, but only a wonk (or a reviewer) would want to read it to the end."&lt;ref name=tar&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/20/back-to-work-clinton-review|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=April 18, 2013|first=Erik|last=Tarloff|date=November 19, 2011|title=Back to Work: Why We Need Smart Government For a Strong Economy by Bill Clinton – review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial journalist Andrew Rosenbaum praised the work for the ''New York Journal of Books''. He wrote, "President Clinton offers straightforward policy options, supported by statistics and documentation— and what a welcome bit of refreshment this is". He also lauded the book's "extremely detailed" points of policy advice.&lt;ref name=ny&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/review/back-work-why-we-need-smart-government-strong-economy|title=Back to Work: Why We Need Smart Government for a Strong Economy|publisher=''New York Journal of Books''|first=Andrew|last=Rosenbaum|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' also published a supportive review. Reporter Carolyn Kellogg wrote that Clinton had authored "a book with the chutzpah that the Democrats have been missing." She also remarked,
{{quote|The most interesting thing about this book is not the economic arguments themselves, but that they're being made in one place, in plain language, by Clinton. The former president has blossomed as an elder statesman, standing side by side with both Bush presidents to support emergency relief, forming his nonpartisan foundation and friendships with powerful players of all stripes... close political watchers may take issue with parts of the book— the characterizations are broad, he omits his own administration's healthcare efforts and underplays its role in financial deregulation, his hopes for green technology are rosier than others predict, and very real political influences like money and lobbyists don't factor into his analysis or prescriptions. But Clinton himself seems convinced he's put together a coherent economic picture that is honest, persuasive and necessary.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/08/entertainment/la-et-book-20111108|title=Book review: 'Back to Work' by Bill Clinton|publisher=''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''|date=November 8, 2011|first=Carolyn|last=Kellogg|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Barbary pirates''', sometimes called '''Barbary corsairs''' or '''Ottoman corsairs''', were [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Maghrebis]] [[pirate]]s and [[privateer]]s who operated from [[North Africa]], based primarily in the ports of [[Salé]], [[Rabat]], [[Algiers]], [[Tunis]], and [[Tripoli]]. This area was known in [[Europe]] as the [[Barbary Coast]], a term derived from the name of its Berber inhabitants. Their predation extended throughout the [[Mediterranean]], south along [[West Africa]]'s [[Atlantic]] seaboard and into the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] as far north as [[Iceland]], but they primarily operated in the western Mediterranean. In addition to seizing [[Merchant vessel|merchant ships]], they engaged in ''[[Ghazw|Razzias]]'', raids on European coastal towns and villages, mainly in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal, but also in the British Isles,&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; the Netherlands, and as far away as Iceland.&lt;ref name=Toll/&gt; The main purpose of their attacks was to capture [[Christian]] [[slavery|slaves]] for the [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman slave trade]] as well as the general [[Arab slave trade|Arab slavery market]] in North Africa and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_02.shtml |title=British Slaves on the Barbary Coast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While such raids had occurred since soon after the Muslim conquest of Iberia, the terms "Barbary pirates" and "Barbary corsairs" are normally applied to the raiders active from the 16th century onwards, when the frequency and range of the slavers' attacks increased. In that period Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli came under the sovereignty of the [[Ottoman Empire]], either as directly administered provinces or as autonomous dependencies known as the [[Barbary States]]. Similar raids were undertaken from [[Republic of Bou Regreg|Salé]] and other ports in [[Morocco]].

Barbary corsairs captured thousands of merchant ships and repeatedly raided coastal towns. As a result, residents abandoned their former villages of long stretches of coast in Spain and Italy. Between 100,000 and 250,000 Iberians were enslaved by these raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fort Caroline, the Search for America's Lost Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gx7zBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35&amp;lpg=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The raids were such a problem coastal settlements were seldom undertaken until the 19th century. Between 1580 and 1680 corsairs were said to have captured about 850,000 people as slaves and from 1530 to 1780 as many as 1,250,000 people were enslaved.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt; However, these numbers have been questioned by the historian David Earle.&lt;ref name="Earle" /&gt; Some of these corsairs were European outcasts and [[Religious conversion|converts]] (renegade) such as [[Jack Ward|John Ward]] and [[Zymen Danseker]].&lt;ref name=Toll&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/books/review/Toll-t.html Review of ''Pirates of Barbary''] by Ian W. Toll, ''New York Times,'' 12 Dec. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] and [[Oruç Reis]], Turkish Barbarossa Brothers, who took control of Algiers on behalf of the Ottomans in the early 16th century, were also notorious corsairs. The European pirates brought advanced sailing and shipbuilding techniques to the Barbary Coast around 1600, which enabled the corsairs to extend their activities into the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=Toll/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2018}} The effects of the Barbary raids peaked in the early to mid-17th century.

Long after Europeans had abandoned [[oar]]-driven vessels in favor of sailing ships carrying tons of powerful cannon, many Barbary warships were [[galley]]s carrying a hundred or more fighting men armed with [[cutlass]]es and small arms. The Barbary navies were not battle fleets. When they sighted a European [[frigate]], they fled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conlin|first1=Joseph R.|title=The American Past: A Survey of American History, Volume I: To 1877|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of corsair activity began to diminish in the latter part of the 17th century,&lt;ref name="Chaney"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaney|first=Eric|date=2015-10-01|title=Measuring the military decline of the Western Islamic World: Evidence from Barbary ransoms|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014498315000169|journal=Explorations in Economic History|volume=58|pages=107–124|doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2015.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the more powerful European navies started to compel the Barbary States to make peace and cease attacking their shipping. However, the ships and coasts of Christian states without such effective protection continued to suffer until the early 19th century. Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814–15, European powers agreed upon the need to suppress the Barbary corsairs entirely and the threat was largely subdued. Occasional incidents occurred, including two [[Barbary wars]] between the [[United States]] and the Barbary States, until finally terminated by the [[French North Africa|French conquest of Algiers in 1830]].

==History==
Piracy by Muslim populations had been known in the Mediterranean since at least the 9th century and the short-lived [[Emirate of Crete]]. [[Provence]] was plagued by [[Saracen]] slave raids in the [[Carolingian era]]; in 869, archbishop [[Rotlandus of Arles]] was captured, and died before he could be released after the payment of a ransom in weapons, treasure and slaves. 

In 1198 the problem of Berber piracy and slave-taking was so great that a religious order, the [[Trinitarians]], were founded to collect ransoms and even to exchange themselves as ransom for those captured and pressed into slavery in North Africa.  In the 14th century Tunisian corsairs became enough of a threat to provoke a Franco-Genoese attack on Mahdia in 1390, also known as the "[[Barbary Crusade]]". [[Morisco]] exiles of the [[Reconquista]] and Maghreb pirates added to the numbers, but it was not until the expansion of the Ottoman Empire and the arrival of the privateer and admiral [[Kemal Reis]] in 1487 that the Barbary corsairs became a true menace to shipping from European Christian nations.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor (1988), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Captain walter croker horror stricken at algiers 1815.jpg|thumb|British captain witnessing the miseries of Christian slaves in Algiers, 1815]]
The Barbary pirates had long attacked English and other European shipping along the North Coast of Africa. They had been attacking English merchant and passengers ships since the 1600s. Regular fundraising for ransoms was undertaken generally by families and local church groups, who generally raised the ransoms for individuals. The government did not ransom ordinary persons. The English became familiar with [[captivity narratives]] written by Barbary pirates' prisoners and ransomed captives, as so many people were taken. After English colonists began to go to North America and be taken captive by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], both the colonists and people in England had some basis for considering the meaning of captivity for a Christian in an alien society.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Colley (2004) ''Captives: Britain, Empire, and the World, 1600–1850'', Anchor Books Edition, New York {{ISBN|978-0-385-72146-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Revolution]] the pirates attacked American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean. But, on December 20, 1777, [[Sultan]] [[Mohammed III of Morocco]] declared that American merchant ships would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage into the Mediterranean and along the coast. The [[Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship]] stands as the U.S.'s oldest non-broken friendship [[treaty]]&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Priscilla H. and Richard S.

As late as 1798, an islet near [[Sardinia]] was attacked by the [[Beylik of Tunis|Tunisians]], and more than 900 inhabitants were taken away as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5q9zcB3JS40C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500–1800]''. Robert Davis (2004). p.45. {{ISBN|1-4039-4551-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history, geography was on the pirates' side on the Northern coast of Africa. The coast was ideal for their wants and needs. With natural harbours often backed by lagoons, it provided a haven for guerrilla warfare, such as attacks on shipping vessels venturing through their territory. On the coast, mountainous areas provided ample reconnaissance for the corsairs as well. Ships were spotted from afar; the pirates had time to prepare their attacks and surprise the ships.

===16th century===
[[File:Battle of Preveza (1538).jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Preveza]], 1538]]
Moors and Turkish adventurers from the [[Levant]], of whom the most successful were [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Hızır]] and [[Aruj|Oruç]], natives of [[Mitylene]], increased the number of raids around the turn of the 15th century. In response, Spain began to conquer the coastal towns of [[Oran]], Algiers and [[Tunis]]. But after Oruç was killed in battle with the Spanish in 1518, his brother Hızır appealed to [[Selim I]], the Ottoman sultan, who sent him troops. In 1529, Hızır drove the Spaniards from the rocky, fortified island in front of Algiers, and founded the Ottoman power in the region. From about 1518 till the death of [[Uluç Ali]] in 1587, Algiers was the main seat of government of the [[beylerbey]]s of northern Africa, who ruled over Tripoli, Tunisia and Algeria. From 1587 to 1659, they were ruled by Ottoman [[pasha]]s, sent from [[Constantinople]] to govern for three years; but in the latter year a military revolt in Algiers reduced the pashas to nonentities.

From 1659, these African cities, although nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, were in fact military republics that chose their own rulers and lived by war booty captured from the Spanish and Portuguese. There are several cases of [[Sephardic Jew]]s, including [[Sinan Reis]] and [[Samuel Pallache]], who upon [[Alhambra Decree|fleeing Iberia]] turned to attacking the Spanish Empire's shipping under the Ottoman flag, a profitable strategy of revenge for the [[Inquisition]]'s [[religious persecution]].&lt;ref name="kritzler59"&gt;{{cite book|title=Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean|pages=59–60|author=Kritzler, Edward|isbn=978-0-7679-1952-4|date=November 3, 2009|publisher=Anchor|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z3M6xn93xYEC&amp;pg=PT177&amp;lpg=PT177&amp;dq=%E2%96%A0Neil+Grant+-+Barbarossa,+the+Pirate+King#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%96%A0%22the%20great%20jew%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plaut"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/printArticle.cfm?contentid=36634|title=Putting the Oy Back into 'Ahoy'|author=[[Steven Plaut|Plaut, Steven]]|date=October 15, 2008|accessdate=2010-04-27}} [http://www.jackwhite.net/iberia/caribbean.html][http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/55658.html][http://bechollashon.org/database/index.php?/article/2312]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first period (1518–1587), the beylerbeys were admirals of the sultan, commanding great fleets and conducting war operations for political ends. They were slave-hunters and their methods were ferocious. After 1587, the sole object of their successors became plunder, on land and sea. The maritime operations were conducted by the captains, or ''reises'', who formed a class or even a corporation. Cruisers were fitted out by investors and commanded by the ''reises''. Ten percent of the value of the prizes was paid to the pasha or his successors, who bore the titles of ''agha'' or ''[[dey]]'' or ''bey''.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Barbary Pirates}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Genoise tower in corsica.jpg|thumb|The Barbary pirates frequently attacked Corsica, resulting in many [[Genoese tower]]s being erected.]]

In 1544 Hayreddin captured the island of [[Ischia]], taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 2,000–7,000 inhabitants of [[Lipari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eACqCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA453&amp;lpg=PA453&amp;dq=Battle+of+A%C3%AFn-el-Turk&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ozbrAhaIpo&amp;sig=3u6Fl8lZIp7Ue9kKuGW5s_Z2jQw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK8MPm_KXZAhXh5oMKHYo2C20Q6AEIUzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Battle%20of%20A%C3%AFn-el-Turk&amp;f=false|title=Concise History of Islam|last=Syed|first=Muzaffar Husain|last2=Akhtar|first2=Syed Saud|last3=Usmani|first3=B.

Barbary corsairs often attacked the [[Balearic Islands]], and in response many coastal watchtowers and fortified [[church (building)|churches]] were erected. The threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of [[Formentera]].

Even at this early stage, the European states fought back: [[Livorno]]'s monument ''Quattro Mori'' celebrates 16th-century victories against the Barbary corsairs won by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]] and the [[Order of Saint Stephen]], of which the Grand Duke of Tuscany [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando I de' Medici]] was Grand Master. Another response was the construction of the original [[frigate]]s; light, fast and maneuverable galleys, designed to run down Barbary corsairs trying to get away with their loot and slaves. Other measures included coastal lookouts to give warning for people to withdraw into fortified places and rally local forces to fight the corsairs. This latter goal was especially difficult to achieve as the corsairs had the advantage of surprise; the vulnerable European Mediterranean coasts were very long and easily accessible from the north African Barbary bases, and the corsairs were careful in planning their raids.

During the first half of the 17th century, Barbary raiding was at its peak. This was due largely to the contribution of Dutch corsairs, notably [[Zymen Danseker]] (Simon de Danser), who used the Barbary ports as bases for attacking Spanish shipping during the [[Dutch Revolt]]. They cooperated with local raiders and introduced them to the latest Dutch sailing rigs, enabling them to brave Atlantic waters.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred S. Bradford (2007), ''Flying the Black Flag'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these Dutch corsairs converted to Islam and settled permanently in North Africa. Two examples are Süleyman Reis, "[[De Veenboer]]", who became admiral of the Algerian corsair fleet in 1617, and his quartermaster Murat Reis, born [[Jan Janszoon]]. Both worked for the notorious Dutch corsair [[Zymen Danseker]].

A notable counter action occurred in 1607, when the [[Order of Saint Stephen|Knights of Saint Stephen]] (under [[Jacopo Inghirami]]) sacked [[Annaba|Bona]] in Algeria, killing 470 and taking 1,464 captives.&lt;ref name=PPZ&gt;{{cite book|title=War at Sea in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance |last=John B.

[[File:Fathers of the Redemption.jpg|thumb|The work of the [[Mercedarians]] was in ransoming Christian slaves held in Muslim hands, ''Histoire de Barbarie et de ses Corsaires'', 1637]]
Barbary corsair attacks were common in southern [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], south and east [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]], [[Elba]], the [[Italian Peninsula]] (especially the [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] coast), [[Sicily]] and [[Malta]]. They also occurred on the Atlantic northwest coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] as in 1617, when the North African corsairs launched their major attack in the region. They destroyed and sacked Bouzas, [[Cangas do Morrazo]] and the churches of [[Moaña]] and Darbo.

Occasionally coastal raids reached farther afield. [[Iceland]] was subject to [[The Turkish abductions|raids]] in 1627. Jan Janszoon (Murat Reis the Younger) is said to have taken 400 prisoners; 242 of the captives later were sold into slavery on the [[Barbary Coast]]. The corsairs took only young people and those in good physical condition. All those offering resistance were killed, and the old people were gathered into a church which was set on fire. Among those captured was [[Ólafur Egilsson]], who was ransomed the next year. Upon returning to Iceland, he wrote an account about his experience. Such [[captivity narrative]]s by Europeans who had been held in Muslim states eventually constituted a literary genre.

[[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] was subject to a similar attack. In June 1631 Murat Reis, with corsairs from Algiers and armed troops of the [[Ottoman Empire]], stormed ashore at the little harbor village of [[Baltimore, County Cork]]. They [[Sack of Baltimore|captured almost all the villagers]] and took them away to a life of slavery in North Africa.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt; The prisoners were destined for a variety of fates&amp;nbsp;— some lived out their days chained to the oars as galley slaves, while women spent long years as [[concubines]] in harems or within the walls of the sultan's palace. Only two of these captives ever returned to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ekin|first=Des|title=The Stolen Village - Baltimore and the Barbary Pirates|year=2006|publisher=OBrien|isbn=978-0-86278-955-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2014}}

More than 20,000 captives were said to be imprisoned in Algiers alone. The rich were often able to secure release through ransom, but the poor were condemned to slavery. Their masters would on occasion allow them to secure freedom by professing Islam. A long list might be given of people of good social position, not only Italians or Spaniards, but German or English travelers in the south, who were captives for a time.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt; While the chief victims were the inhabitants of the coasts of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] and Spain, all traders of nations which did not pay tribute for immunity or force the Barbary States to leave them alone were liable to be taken at sea. Religious orders&amp;nbsp;– the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorists]] and [[Congregation of the Mission|Lazarists]]&amp;nbsp;– worked for the redemption of captives, and in many countries the wealthy left legacies to support such redemptions.

Barbary piracy thrived on the competition among European powers. France encouraged the corsairs against Spain, and later Britain and Holland supported them against France. By the second half of the 17th century, the greater European naval powers were able to strike back effectively enough to intimidate the Barbary States into making peace with them. However, those countries' commercial interests benefited by the pirates continuing attacks on their competitors. As a result, they did not cooperate to impose a more general cessation of corsair activity.

England was the most successful of the Christian states in dealing with the corsair threat.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} From the 1630s onwards England had signed peace treaties with the Barbary States on various occasions, but invariably breaches of these agreements led to renewed wars. A particular bone of contention was the tendency of foreign ships to pose as English to avoid attack. However, growing English naval power and increasingly persistent operations against the corsairs proved increasingly costly for the Barbary States. During the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] a series of English expeditions won victories over raiding Barbary squadrons and mounted attacks on their home ports; these actions permanently ended the Barbary threat to English shipping.{{citation needed|reason=Almost certainly false, because British continued antipiracy expeditions in subsequent centuries|date=October 2018}} In 1675 a [[Royal Navy]] squadron led by [[John Narborough|Sir John Narborough]] negotiated a lasting peace with Tunis and, after bombarding the city to induce compliance, with Tripoli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo2/A32172.0001.001/1:2?rgn=div1;view=fulltext |title=Articles of peace &amp; commerce between ...

Algiers, the most powerful of the Barbary States{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}, returned to war the following year, breaking a treaty made in 1671. After suffering defeats at the hands of an English squadron under [[Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Torrington|Arthur Herbert]], Algiers made peace again in 1682, in a treaty that lasted until 1816. France, which had recently emerged as a leading naval power, achieved comparable success soon afterwards. It bombarded Algiers in 1682, 1683 and 1688 to secure a lasting peace, and forced Tripoli to sue for peace by bombardment in 1686.

A 2016 study found that Barbary corsairs were less militarily powerful after 1675 than they were at the start of the seventeenth century.

[[File:BainbridgeTribute.jpg|thumb|Captain [[William Bainbridge]] paying tribute to the [[Dey]] of Algiers, circa 1800]]

Piracy was enough of a problem that some states entered into the redemption business. In Denmark, "At the beginning of the 18th century money was collected systematically in all churches, and a so called 'slave fund' (slavekasse) was established by the state in 1715. Funds were brought in through a compulsory insurance sum for seafarers. 165 slaves were ransomed by this institution between 1716 and 1736."&lt;ref name="madsen"&gt;[http://complit.ku.dk/islamineuropeanliterature/workingpapers/dokument4/ Peter Madsen, "Danish slaves in Barbary"], ''Islam in European Literature Conference,'' Denmark {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110054744/http://complit.ku.dk/islamineuropeanliterature/workingpapers/dokument4/ |date=November 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Between 1716 and 1754 19 ships from Denmark-Norway were captured with 208 men; piracy was thus a serious problem for the Danish merchant fleet."&lt;ref name="madsen"/&gt;

In the late 18th century piracy began to arise again. In [[Bombardment of Algiers (1783)|1783]] and 1784 the Spanish bombarded [[Algiers]] to end piracy. The [[Bombardment of Algiers (1784)|second time]] [[Antonio Barceló|Admiral Barceló]] damaged the city so severely that the Algerian [[Dey]] asked [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spain]] to negotiate a peace treaty. From then on Spanish vessels and coasts were safe for several years. Separately, the Danish [[Action of 16 May 1797|attacked Tripoli in 1797]]. 

Until the [[American Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] treaties with the [[Northwest Africa|North African]] states protected American ships from the [[Barbary Coast|Barbary]] corsairs. [[Morocco]], which in 1777 was [[Moroccan–American Treaty of Friendship|the first independent nation to publicly recognize the United States]], in 1784 became the first Barbary power to seize an American vessel after the nation achieved independence. The Barbary threat led directly to the United States founding the [[United States Navy]] in March 1794. While the United States did secure peace treaties with the Barbary states, it was obliged to pay tribute for protection from attack. The burden was substantial: in 1800 payments in ransom and tribute to the Barbary states amounted to 20% of [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal government]]'s annual expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oren|first=Michael B.|title=The Middle East and the Making of the United States, 1776 to 1815|date=2005-11-03|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/05/11/michaelOren.html| accessdate=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States conducted the [[First Barbary War]] in 1801 and the [[Second Barbary War]] in 1815 to gain more favorable peace terms; it ended the payment of tribute. But, Algiers broke the 1805 peace treaty after two years, and refused to implement the 1815 treaty until compelled to do so by Britain in 1816.

The [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), which ended the [[Napoleonic Wars]], led to increased European consensus on the need to end Barbary raiding. The sacking of [[Palma, Sardinia|Palma]] on the island of [[Sardinia]] by a Tunisian squadron, which carried off 158 inhabitants, roused widespread indignation. Britain had by this time banned the [[slave trade]] and was seeking to induce other countries to do likewise. States that were more vulnerable to the corsairs complained that Britain cared more for ending the trade in [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] than stopping the enslavement of Europeans and Americans by the Barbary States.

[[File:Sm Bombardment of Algiers, August 1816-Luny.jpg|thumb|right|''Bombardment of Algiers by Lord Exmouth in August 1816'', [[Thomas Luny]]]]

In order to neutralise this objection and further the anti-slavery campaign, in 1816 Britain sent [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]] to secure new concessions from [[Ottoman Tripolitania|Tripoli]], [[Beylik of Tunis|Tunis]], and [[Ottoman Algeria|Algiers]], including a pledge to treat Christian captives in any future conflict as [[prisoners of war]] rather than slaves. He imposed peace between Algiers and the kingdoms of [[Piedmont-Sardinia|Sardinia]] and [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Sicily]]. On his first visit, Lord Exmouth negotiated satisfactory treaties and sailed for home. While he was negotiating, a number of Sardinian fishermen who had settled at [[Annaba|Bona]] on the Tunisian coast were brutally treated without his knowledge. As Sardinians they were technically under British protection, the government sent Exmouth back to secure reparation. On August 17, in combination with a Dutch squadron under Admiral Van de Capellen, Exmouth [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|bombarded Algiers]]. Both Algiers and Tunis made fresh concessions as a result.

The Barbary states had difficulty securing uniform compliance with a total prohibition of slave-raiding, as this had been traditionally of central importance to the North African economy. Slavers continued to take captives by preying on less well-protected peoples. Algiers subsequently renewed its slave-raiding, though on a smaller scale. Europeans at the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1818 discussed possible retaliation. In 1820 a British fleet under Admiral Sir Harry Neal bombarded Algiers. Corsair activity based in Algiers did not entirely cease until France [[French Algeria#The French conquest of Algeria|conquered the state in 1830]].&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;

==Slaves==
===Barbary slaves===
{{See also|Arab slave trade|Barbary slave trade}}
According to Robert Davis, between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in [[North Africa]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] between the 16th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Robert. ''Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500-1800''.[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1403945519]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="researchnews.osu.edu"&gt;[http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/whtslav.htm "When Europeans were slaves: Research suggests white slavery was much more common than previously believed"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220038/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/whtslav.htm |date=2011-07-25 }}, ''Research News'', Ohio State University&lt;/ref&gt; However, to extrapolate his numbers, Davis assumes the number of European slaves captured by Barbary pirates were constant for a 250-year period, stating:

{{quote|There are no records of how many men, women and children were enslaved, but it is possible to calculate roughly the number of fresh captives that would have been needed to keep populations steady and replace those slaves who died, escaped, were ransomed, or converted to Islam. On this basis it is thought that around 8,500 new slaves were needed annually to replenish numbers – about 850,000 captives over the century from 1580 to 1680.  By extension, for the 250 years between 1530 and 1780, the figure could easily have been as high as 1,250,000.&lt;ref name=Earle&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/mar/11/highereducation.books|title=New book reopens old arguments about slave raids on Europe|last=Carroll|first=Rory|date=2004-03-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-11|last2=correspondent|first2=Africa|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Davis' numbers have been question by the historian David Earle, who said of Davis' numbers "His figures sound a bit dodgy and I think he may be exaggerating" and cautioned that the true picture of Europeans slaves is clouded by the fact the corsairs also seized non-Christian whites from eastern Europe and black people from west Africa.&lt;ref name=Earle/&gt;

In addition, the number of slaves traded was hyperactive, with exaggerated estimates relying on peak years to calculate averages for entire centuries, or millennia.  Hence, there were wide fluctuations year-to-year, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, given slave imports, and given the fact that, prior to the 1840s, there are no consistent records.  Middle East expert, John Wright, cautions that modern estimates are based on back-calculations from human observation.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wright|first=John|title=Trans-Saharan Slave Trade|year=2007|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Such observations, across the late 1500s and early 1600s observers, account for around 35,000 European Christian slaves held throughout this period on the Barbary Coast, across Tripoli, Tunis, but mostly in Algiers. The majority were sailors (particularly those who were English), taken with their ships, but others were fishermen and poor coastal villagers.  However, most of these captives were people from lands close to Africa, particularly Spain and Italy.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml|title=British Slaves on the Barbary Coast|last=Davis|first=Robert|date=17 Feb 2011|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From bases on the Barbary coast, North Africa, the Barbary pirates raided ships traveling through the Mediterranean and along the northern and western coasts of Africa, plundering their cargo and enslaving the people they captured. From at least 1500, the pirates also conducted raids along seaside towns of Italy, Spain, France, England, the Netherlands and as far away as Iceland, capturing men, women and children. On some occasions, settlements such as [[Baltimore, County Cork|Baltimore]], [[Ireland]] were abandoned following the raid, only being resettled many years later. Between 1609 and 1616, England alone had 466 merchant ships lost to Barbary pirates.&lt;ref&gt;Rees Davies, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml "British Slaves on the Barbary Coast"], [[BBC]], 1 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

While Barbary corsairs looted the cargo of ships they captured, their primary goal was to capture people for sale as slaves or for ransom. Those who had family or friends who might ransom them were held captive, but not obliged to work; the most famous of these was the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], who was held for almost five years. Others were sold into various types of servitude. Attractive women or boys could be used as [[sex slaves]]. Captives who converted to Islam were generally freed, since enslavement of Muslims was prohibited; but this meant that they could never return to their native countries.&lt;ref&gt;Diego de Haedo, ''Topografía e historia general de Argel'', 3 vols., Madrid, 1927-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Eisenberg, "¿Por qué volvió Cervantes de Argel?", in ''Ingeniosa invención: Essays on Golden Age Spanish Literature for Geoffrey L.

[[File:Augustins - Le Sultan du Maroc - Eugène Delacroix.jpg|thumb|Sultan of Morocco, by [[Eugène Delacroix]]]]
Captives often suffered from privation on voyages to North Africa if taken at a distance. Those who survived the journeys were often forced to walk through town as they were taken to slave auctions. The slaves typically had to stand from eight in the morning until two in the afternoon while buyers viewed them.
Next came the auction, where the townspeople would bid on the captives they wanted to purchase and once that was over, the governor of Algiers (the Dey) had the chance to purchase any slave he wanted for the price they were sold at the auction. During the auctions the slaves would be forced to run and jump around to show their strength and stamina. After purchase, the captives would either be held for ransom, or be put to work. Slaves were used for a wide variety of jobs, from hard manual labor to housework (the job assigned to most women slaves). At night the slaves were put into prisons called ''''[[bagnio]]s'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; (derived from the Italian word ''"bagno"'' for ''public bath'', inspired by the Turks' use of Roman baths at Constantinople as prisons),&lt;ref name="BAGNO"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bagnio ''Definition of "bagnio" from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary'']. Accessed 23 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; which were often hot and overcrowded. However, these bagnios began improving by the 18th century. Some bagnios had chapels, hospitals, shops, and bars run by captives, though such amenities remained uncommon.

===Galley slaves===
Although the conditions in bagnios were harsh, they were better than those endured by [[galley]] slaves. Most Barbary galleys were at sea for around eighty to a hundred days a year, but when the slaves assigned to them were on land, they were forced to do hard manual labor. There were exceptions: "galley slaves of the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople would be permanently confined to their galleys, and often served extremely long terms, averaging around nineteen years in the late seventeenth-century and early eighteenth-century periods. These slaves rarely got off the galley but lived there for years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ekin|first=Des|title=The Stolen Village - Baltimore and the Barbary Pirates |year=2006|publisher=OBrien|isbn=978-0-86278-955-8|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, rowers were shackled and chained where they sat, and never allowed to leave. Sleeping (which was limited), eating, defecation and urination took place at the seat to which they were shackled. There were usually five or six rowers on each oar. Overseers would walk back and forth and whip slaves considered not to be working hard enough.

==Famous Barbary corsairs==
According to historian [[Adrian Tinniswood]], the most notorious corsairs were English and European renegades who had learned their trade as [[privateer]]s, and who moved to the Barbary Coast during peacetime to pursue their trade. These outcasts brought up-to-date naval expertise to the piracy business, and enabled the corsairs to make long-distance slave-catching raids as far away as [[Iceland]] and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].&lt;ref name=Toll/&gt; The English corsair [[Henry Mainwaring]] later returned to England after gaining a royal pardon. He was knighted, elected to Parliament, and appointed a vice admiral of the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=Toll/&gt;&lt;!-- There must be more to this story - needs explanation--&gt;

===The Barbarossa brothers===

====Oruç Barbarossa====
{{Main|Aruj}}
The most famous of the corsairs in North Africa were brothers Oruç and Hızır Hayreddin. They, and two less well-known brothers, all became Barbary corsairs; they were called the Barbarossas (Italian for Redbeards) after the red beard of Oruç, the eldest. Oruç captured the island of Djerba for the Ottoman Empire in 1502 or 1503. He often attacked Spanish territories on the coast of North Africa; during one failed attempt in 1512 he lost his left arm to a cannonball. The eldest Barbarossa also went on a rampage through Algiers in 1516, and captured the town with the help of the Ottoman Empire. He executed the ruler of Algiers and everybody he suspected would oppose him, including local rulers. He was finally captured and killed by the Spanish in 1518, and put on display.

====Hızır Hayreddin Barbarossa====
{{Main|Hayreddin Barbarossa}}
[[File:Barbaros minyatür.jpg|thumb|Ottoman admiral [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]]]]
Oruç, based mainly on land, was not the best-known of the Barbarossas. His youngest brother Hızır (later called Hayreddin or Kheir ed-Din) was a more traditional corsair. He was a capable engineer and spoke at least six languages. He dyed the hair of his head and beard with [[Henna#Hair dye|henna]] to redden it like Oruç's. After capturing many crucial coastal areas, Hayreddin was appointed admiral-in-chief of the Ottoman sultan's fleet. Under his command the Ottoman Empire was able to gain and keep control of the eastern Mediterranean for over thirty years. Barbaros Hızır Hayreddin Pasha died in 1546 of a fever, possibly the plague.

===Captain Jack Ward===
{{Main|Jack Ward}}
English corsair Jack, or John, Ward was once called "beyond doubt the greatest scoundrel that ever sailed from England" by the English ambassador to Venice. Ward was a privateer for Queen Elizabeth during her war with Spain; after the end of the war, he became a corsair. With some associates he captured a ship in about 1603 and sailed it to Tunis; he and his crew converted to [[Islam]]. He was successful and became rich. He introduced heavily armed square-rigged ships, used instead of galleys, to the North African area, a major reason for the Barbary's future dominance of the Mediterranean. He died of plague in 1622.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born around 1485 in the [[Emirate of Granada]], but was forced to flee to Morocco when she was very young to escape the [[Reconquista]]. In Morocco, she gathered a crew largely of exiled [[Moors]], and launched pirate expeditions against Spain and Portugal to avenge the Reconquista, protect Morocco from Christian pirates, and seek riches and glory. She co-founded the Barbary Corsairs with her allies the Barbarossa brothers, who divided the Mediterranean between them—the Barbarossas and their Ottoman fleet operating in the [[Eastern Mediterranean|east]], and Sayyida al-Hurra and her Moorish and North-African pirates operating in the [[Western Mediterranean|west]]. Sayyida al-Hurra became wealthy and renowned enough for the Sultan of Morocco, [[Abu al-Abbas Ahmad ibn Muhammad|Ahmad al-Wattasi]] to make her his queen. Notably, however, she refused to marry in his capital of [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], and would not get married but in Tétouan, of which she was governor. This was the first and only time in history that a Moroccan monarch had married away from his capital.

Barbary corsairs are protagonists in ''[[Le pantere di Algeri]] (the panthers of Algiers)'' by [[Emilio Salgari]]. They were featured in a number of other noted novels, including ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' by [[Daniel Defoe]], ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]], ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' by [[Kenneth Grahame]], ''[[The Sea Hawk]]'' and the ''Sword of Islam'' by [[Rafael Sabatini]], ''[[The Algerine Captive]]'' by [[Royall Tyler]], ''[[Aubrey-Maturin series#Master and Commander|Master and Commander]]'' by [[Patrick O'Brian]], the ''[[Baroque Cycle]]'' by [[Neal Stephenson]], ''[[The Walking Drum]]'' by [[Louis Lamour]], ''[[Doctor Dolittle]]'' by [[Hugh Lofting]], ''[[Corsair (Cussler novel)|Corsair]]'' by [[Clive Cussler]] and ''[[Angelique (French series)|Angélique in Barbary]]'' by [[Anne Golon]]. [[Miguel de Cervantes]], the Spanish author, was captive for five years as a slave in the ''[[bagnio]]'' of Algiers, and reflected his experience in some of his fictional (but not directly autobiographical) writings, including the Captive's tale in ''[[Don Quixote]]'', his two plays set in Algiers, ''El Trato de Argel'' (The Treaty of Algiers) and ''Los Baños de Argel'' (The Baths of Algiers), and episodes in a number of other works. In [[Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' (a [[Singspiel]]), two European ladies are discovered in a Turkish harem, presumably captured by Barbary corsairs. [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s opera ''[[L'Italiana in Algeri]]'' is based on the capture of several slaves by Barbary corsairs led by the [[bey]] of [[Algiers]].

One of the stereotypical features of a pirate as portrayed in popular culture, the [[Eyepatch|eye patch]], may have been partially derived from the [[Arab]] corsair [[Rahmah ibn Jabir al-Jalahimah]], who wore a patch after losing an eye in battle in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Belgrave (1966), ''The Pirate Coast'', p. 122, [[George Bell &amp; Sons]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Little Johnny England]]'' song, "Lily of Barbary", tells the story of an English man who is enslaved by Barbary corsairs and sold as a slave in Algiers. He is freed when his master dies. He becomes a merchant and buys the freedom of another English slave girl.

The song ''[[Coast of High Barbaree]]'' tells of a sailing ship that came across a pirate ship off the Barbary Coast and defeated the pirates, who were left to drown.

The '''Robert and Renée Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs''' (also known as the '''Belfer Center''') is a permanent research center located within the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]]. Since 2017, the center is led by Director [[Ash Carter]], former US Secretary of Defense and Co-Director Eric Rosenbach, former Assistant Secretary of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.belfercenter.org/about|title=About|website=Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belfer was founded in 1973&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Organizations/Detail/?id=165758 Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs (BCSIA)], International Relations and Security Network (ISN), Zurich&lt;/ref&gt; by biochemist [[Paul M.

Following a grant from the [[Ford Foundation]], the program was re-established as the Center for Science and International Affairs, becoming the first permanent research center at the newly formed School of Government. In 1997, following further endowment, the center was renamed as the '''Robert and Renée Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs''' in honor of Robert A. Belfer, founder of Belco Oil &amp; Gas Corporation.

In 2012, the [[Stanton Foundation]] provided funds for a paid [[Wikipedian in residence]] at the Belfer Center. This became controversial due to links between the Belfer Center and the Stanton Foundation (the directors of each are a married couple) and public concerns about [[conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia]].&lt;ref name="Daily Dot Belfer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailydot.com/business/wikipedia-paid-editing-scandal-stanton/ |title=One of Wikimedia's largest donors accused in paid editing scandal |publisher=[[The Daily Dot]] |author=Tim Sampson  |date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center is organized into subgroups with specific areas of focus; for example, an [[energy technology]] innovation policy group led by [[Laura Diaz Anadon]].&lt;ref name="twsScienceMag"&gt;{{cite web

A '''Board of Estimate''' is a governing body in many counties and municipalities, particularly in the [[United States]].

Typically, the board's membership will consist of a combination of elected officials from the executive branch (e.g., the [[mayor]] or county executive) and the legislative branch (called the [[City Council]] or, in some localities, the Board of Supervisors), and its powers are usually concentrated in such areas as taxation and land use (especially [[zoning]] laws).

[[Image:Bandera Conceyu Xoven.svg|thumb|Conceyu Xoven Flag]]'''Conceyu Xoven''' ("Young Council" in [[Leonese language|Leonese]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] political youth organization that demanded the [[self-determination]] of the proposed [[Leonese Country]]. It was affiliated with the [[Leonese People's Union]] as its [[youth wing]] until April 2010, when they were replaced by the [[Leonesist Youth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La UPL rompe con Conceyu y crea Juventudes Leonesistas|url=http://www.lacronicadeleon.es/2010/04/09/leon/la-upl-rompe-con-conceyu-y-crea-juventudes-leonesistas-76016.htm|publisher=[[La Crónica de León]]|date=09-04-2010|accessdate=2012-12-13|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPL bendice a sus nuevas juventudes y rompe con el Conceyu de Abel Pardo|url=http://www.diariodeleon.es/noticias/afondo/upl-bendice-a-sus-nuevas-juventudes-y-rompe-con-conceyu-de-abel-pardo_519825.html|publisher=[[Diario de León]]|date=09-04-2010|accessdate=2012-12-13|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceyu Xoven claimed to have had more than 1,500 members and to have been the most important organization in the Leonese Country, having won the University of León elections for students.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The organization defended the self-government of the Spanish provinces of [[province of León|León]], [[Province of Zamora|Zamora]], [[Province of Salamanca|Salamanca]] and a so-called "reunification" referendum in territories from other provinces, autonomous communities and countries, as the "Carrión Strip" ([[Palencia (province)|Palencia]]), the Valderaduey valley ([[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]]), [[El Barco de Ávila]]-[[Piedrahita]] area ([[Ávila (province)|Ávila]]), [[Valdeorras]] &amp; [[Viana (comarca)|Viana]] ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]) and the Portuguese [[Bragança District]]. From the beginning until the end of the organization's activity the General Secretary of ''Conceyu Xoven'' was [[Abel Pardo|Abel Pardo Fernández]].

Members of the organization participated in several municipal elections in the Spanish provinces of [[Province of León|León]] and [[Province of Zamora|Zamora]] within regionalist [[Leonese People's Union|UPL]], and its General Secretary became to be the councillor for Education, New Technologies and Leonese Culture in [[Leon, Spain|León]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Some members of the organization also participated in the lists of the [[Salamancan People's Union]] in the province of [[Salamanca]], where they got two town councillors elected.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Flag==

The flag of the organization was a red field with a thin golden circle and a golden sun symbol within. The colors were those of the Leonese flag and the sun symbol represented the South Astur people, origin of Leonese region, according to Conceyu Xoven.

==Language==

Conceyu Xoven used to make use of [[Leonese language]] as the official language of the organization, and developed some initiatives for its recognition, like a campaign for the officiality of [[Leonese language]] in the reform of the [[Castile and León]] Autonomy Statute.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43041">'''Conditional cash transfer''' ('''CCT''') programs aim to reduce [[poverty]] by making [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare programs]] conditional upon the receivers' actions.  The government (or a charity) only transfers the money to persons who meet certain criteria.  These criteria may include enrolling children into public schools, getting regular check-ups at the doctor's office, receiving [[vaccinations]], or the like.  CCTs seek to help the current generation in poverty, as well as breaking the [[cycle of poverty]] for the next through the development of human capital. Conditional cash transfers could help reduce [[feminization of poverty]].

==Countries==
Conditional cash transfers have been used in many countries:
* '''Argentina'''
* '''Bangladesh''': Female Secondary School Assistance Project, established in 1994.  This CCT program, conditional only on school attendance and girls remaining unmarried, provides tuition and stipends.&lt;ref&gt;"Safety Nets and Transfers: CCT Program Profile - Bangladesh."

==Effectiveness==

Few development initiatives have been evaluated as rigorously as CCT programs.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlings, Laura B.; Rubio, Gloria M. "Evaluating the Impact of Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: Lessons from Latin America." World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3119, August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of conditional cash transfer programs has been accompanied by systematic efforts to measure their effectiveness and understand their broader impact on household behavior,&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTCCT/Resources/5757608-1234228266004/PRR-CCT_web_noembargo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a marked departure from the limited attention that was paid to rigorous impact evaluations in the past. Evaluation results are available for PROGRESA in Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;Fernald, Lia C.H., Paul J. Gertler, and Lynnette M. Neufeld. 2008. "Role of cash in conditional cash transfer programmes for child health, growth, and development: an analysis of Mexico’s Oportunidades." Lancet 327:828-37. http://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/role-conditional-cash-transfers-early-childhood-development-mexico&lt;/ref&gt; PETI in Brazil and the ''Atencion a Crisis'' in Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;Macours, Karen, Patrick Premand, and Reno Vakis. "Transfers, Diversification and Household Risk Strategies: Experimental Evidence with Lessons for Climate Change Adaptation." Working Paper, Paris School of Economics, November 2011. http://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/household-risk-strategies-and-conditional-cash-transfers-nicaragua&lt;/ref&gt; These evaluations reveal that conditional cash transfers can provide effective incentives for investing in the poor’s human capital.

CCTs have affected not only the overall level of consumption, but also the composition of consumption. There is a good deal of evidence that households that receive CCTs spend more on food and, in the food basket, on higher-quality sources of nutrients than do households that do not receive the transfer but have comparable overall income or consumption levels.&lt;ref&gt;Rutter, Jill. “Making the case for rigorous, evidence-based policymaking” The Guardian. February 16, 2012. {{cite web |url=http://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/experiment-incentive-based-welfare-impact-progesa-health-mexico |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907214108/http://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/experiment-incentive-based-welfare-impact-progesa-health-mexico |archivedate=2012-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Turkey, where school enrollment rates among girls were lower than among boys, CCTs have helped reduce this gender gap.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"&gt;Fiszbein, Ariel; Schady, Norbert; Ferreira, Francisco H.G.; Grosh, Margaret; Kelleher,Nial;  Olinto, Pedro; Skoufias, Emmanuel. "CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFERS REDUCING PRESENT AND FUTURE POVERTY." World Bank. http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTCCT/Resources/5757608-1234228266004/PRR-CCT_web_noembargo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

CCTs have resulted in sizeable reductions in poverty among recipients—especially when the transfer has been sufficient, well targeted, and structured in a way that does not discourage recipients from taking other actions to escape poverty. Because CCTs provide a steady income, they have helped protect poor households from the worst effects of unemployment, catastrophic illness, and other sudden income shocks. And making cash transfers to women, as virtually all CCTs do, may have increased their bargaining power.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt;

In the US, a paper by the Institute for Research on Poverty concluded in 2011: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Over time, we find that expenditures have shifted toward the disabled and the elderly, and away from those with the lowest incomes and toward those with higher incomes, with the consequence that post-transfer rates of deep poverty for some groups have increased. We conclude that the U.S. benefit system is paternalistic and tilted toward the support of the employed and toward groups with special needs and perceived deservingness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~scholz/Research/Effectiveness.pdf An Assessment of the Effectiveness of Anti-Poverty Programs in the United States], Ben-Shalom, Moffitt, Scholz, Mai 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Latin America==

Many countries in Latin America are now using CCT programs as a major tool of their social policy since they have been proven to be very effective in helping poor families. By 2011 CCTs had spread to 18 countries in the region and covered as many as 129 million beneficiaries.&lt;ref name="Stampini and Tornarolli (2012)"&gt;Stampini, M. and L. Tornarolli. 2012. “The growth of conditional cash transfers in Latin America and the Caribbean: did they go too far?” IDB Policy Brief n. 185, and IZA policy paper n. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the conditions and amounts of money may vary from country to country, ranging from $5 to $33 per child,&lt;ref&gt;Societies on the Move (September 11, 2010). The Economist. 396(8699), pp. 11-15&lt;/ref&gt; in general these programs provide money to poor families under the condition that those transfers are used as an investment on their children’s human capital, such as regular school attendance and basic preventive health care. The purpose of these programs is to address the inter-generational transmission of poverty and to foster social inclusion by targeting the poor, focusing on children, delivering transfers to women, and changing social accountability relationships between beneficiaries, service providers and governments.&lt;ref name="Brière 2006"&gt;De la Brière, Bénédicte and Rawlings, Laura B. (2006). Examining Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: A Role for Increased Social Inclusion? Social Safety Net Primer Papers. The World Bank&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these transfer schemes are now benefiting around 110 million people in the region, and are considered relatively cheap, costing around 0.5% of their GDP.&lt;ref&gt;Societies on the Move (2010,  September 11). The Economist. 396(8699), pp. 11-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditional cash transfer programs can be very effective in reducing poverty in the short term since they have helped to increase household income and consumption in poor families.They have also worked effectively in increasing school enrollment and attendance, especially in middle school. A substantial improvement in health and nutrition of the children that benefit from these programs has been acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;Actuar Sobre el Futuro: Romper la Transmisión Intergeneracional de la Igualdad (2010). Regional Human Development Report for Latin America and the Caribbean. UNDP&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies by the UNDP have shown that conditional cash transfers neither represented a significant increase in the quality of education and in learning nor significant increased salaries, once the recipients entered the labor force.

Most CCT programs are very well-targeted and effective in reaching the poor and the excluded groups, notably the extreme poor living outside the reach of social protection programs tied with formal sector employment. On average, 80% of the benefits go to the 40% poorest families.&lt;ref name="Brière 2006"/&gt; The programs have also promoted equality of gender since they provide larger funds to girls since they often drop out earlier, so it has increased their enrollment and attendance to secondary levels of education. In the long run, these investments may also yield to significant changes in women's empowerment and insertion in economic networks.&lt;ref name="Brière 2006"/&gt;

==Africa==
While most conditional cash transfer programs are in Latin America, a significant amount of research has been conducted regarding the implementation of these programs in Africa. In addition, programs are looking to the Latin America for examples on how to implement these programs. While there are a few [[unconditional cash transfer]] programs in Africa being tested, two conditional cash transfer programs in Africa are currently being implemented. For CCTs to be successful, they require sufficient infrastructure. Poor education and health systems limit the benefits of CCT programs. Impacts should be seen in regard to the effectiveness of health and education institutions of the country.

=== Morocco ===
Since 2007 a pilot conditional cash transfer program has been researching its effectiveness in Morocco, organized by the [[World Bank]]. The program targets poor regions of Morocco with high dropout rates and should cover 160,000 households by 2010.&lt;ref name="web.worldbank.org"&gt;"Morocco: Conditional Cash Transfers and Education." Middle East and North Africa - Morocco: Conditional Cash Transfers and Education. World Bank, 2007. Web. [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/0,,contentMDK:22705763~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:256299,00.html].&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot program is a comparative test that has four treatment groups. One group is receiving unconditional cash transfers, regardless of child school attendance. The next three are given conditional cash transfers to families of children grades 3-6 based on the child's attendance at school.

The three treatment groups vary in how attendance is monitored, ranging from monitoring attendance based on teacher’s report, all the way to a sophisticated system involving monitoring through biometric fingerprint machines.&lt;ref name="web.worldbank.org"/&gt;

In addition, within each classroom, which parent (the mother or father) is randomized to see if the family benefits more from having the money targeted to one or the other. This study will bring research that assesses the importance of conditionality, monitoring, and targeting within a conditional cash transfer program.&lt;ref name="web.worldbank.org"/&gt;

==Europe==
Conditional cash transfer programs are not used widely in Europe. In the UK, in 2011 [[CentreForum]] proposed an additional child benefit dependent on parenting activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centreforum.org/assets/pubs/parenting-matters.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
In Turkey, CCT program has still been implemented by GDSA since 2003 with education and health components in which almost 6 billion Turkish Liras (app. 2 billion Euros) have been spent to about 3.5 million beneficiary households. In order to be paid regularly in CCT program, students (ages 5–20) have to attend to their school regularly and children (ages 0–6) have to be taken to health centres regularly. All the conditions are being monitored by GDSA from the databases of Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education by the means of an interactive web-based MIS.

The conditional education grants are provided to children of the target group on school enrollment condition, from the first grade through the end of the twelfth grade. Once qualified as beneficiaries, children should maintain at least 80 per cent attendance rate to continue to receive the grant.

Individual payment amounts differ according to components. Girls are paid higher amounts than boys in education component to encourage poor families to send their daughters to school. Besides, due to increasing drop-out rates in higher grades, secondary school (9th-12th grades) students are paid higher amounts than primary school ones in order to ensure the effect of the program on decreasing the drop-out rates.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project named "Strengthening the Impact of the Conditional Cash Transfer Programme in Turkey for Increasing High School Attendance" (Liseye Devam Senden, Destek Bizden) has been started up in December 2014 by GDSA through EU co-finance. The project has been integrated to Turkey's CCT implementation and designed for high school CCT beneficiaries in order to ensure them to get a degree and decrease early school leaving rates which also is one of the most important topics for 2020 European Union  targets for a sustainable growth.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt;

In the scope of the project, extra incentives were added into CCT education programme aiming to support high school education attendance which would provide stronger reinforcement for the CCT families.

==Obstacles and failed programs==
Although the benefits of conditional cash transfer programs across the world have been widely noted, there remains a series of obstacles to their success that have caused some programs to be stunted or terminated completely.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlings, Laura and Gloria Rubio. ''Evaluating the Impact of CCT Programs: Lessons from Latin America.'' World Bank Working Paper Research Policy, no. 3119 (August 2003): 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===External factors===
According to a comprehensive study done by senior research analysts Laura Rawlings and Gloria Rubio of the [[World Bank]], the beginning stages of program implementation present the challenge of creating a reliable implementation schedule.&lt;ref name="Rawlings 2003"&gt;Rawlings, Laura and Gloria Rubio. "Evaluating the Impact of CCT Programs: Lessons from Latin America." World Bank Working Paper Research Policy, no. 3119 (August 2003): 23&lt;/ref&gt; On many occasions, changes in political leadership, natural disasters, or changes in program administration have delayed the implementation schedule and lead to decreased efficiency or program termination.&lt;ref name="Rawlings 2003"/&gt;

An example of the negative outcomes of one such delay is provided by the [[UN Development Programme]]'s in-depth study of the short-lived Nicaragua's [[Social Protection Network]]. According to the study, the movement of the program administration to the country's Ministry of the Family caused a delay in efficiency and resources that, among other factors, led to the program's termination.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Charity. "Nicaragua’s Red de Proteccion Social: An Exemplary but Short-lived Conditional Cash Transfer Program." International Policy Center for Inclusive  Growth, no.17, (2009): 1-42.&lt;/ref&gt; Delays can also be caused by difficulties in developing the program [[management information system]] (MIS).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rawlings, Laura and Gloria Rubio. "Evaluating the Impact of CCT Programs: Lessons from Latin America." World Bank Working Paper Research Policy, no. 3119 (August 2003): 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

One such delay in Mexico's [[Oportunidades]] program caused 27% of its targeted population not to receive any transfers after two years of implementation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In addition to unscheduled delays, other external factors that can hinder a CCT's success pertain to unexpected financial crisis.&lt;ref name="Fizbein 2009"&gt;Fizbein, Ariel and Norbert Shaby. "Conditional Cash Transfers: Reducing Present and Future Poverty." The World Bank. (2009): 125.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a comprehensive assessment provided by the World Bank, the structure of conditional cash transfer programs has not yet been adjusted to retain success in the event of a large financial crisis.&lt;ref name="Fizbein 2009"/&gt;

Primarily, conditional cash transfer programs are not flexible enough to extend benefits to households that fall into the program's targeted population only during economic downturns. Thus, those not normally covered by the program's benefits may be harder hit than those who are but will not be able to be assisted.&lt;ref name="Fizbein 2009"/&gt;

===Exclusion===
Another common obstacle to success in most CCTs is exclusion of needy homes in the targeting process. In an assessment by the World Bank, much exclusion was due to remote communities' inability to access schools or clinics. Many such communities fall into developing countries' most poverty-stricken populations but cannot follow through with conditionalities since the transportation costs to attend schools or hospital visits outweigh the benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Fizbein, Ariel and Norbert Shaby. "Conditional Cash Transfers: Reducing Present and Future Poverty." The World Bank. (2009): 1- 245&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, an evaluation of Mexico's Progresa-[[Oportunidades]] program addresses the issue that those in poverty with debilitating illnesses can be excluded from CCTs due to their physical inability to accomplish the conditionalities.&lt;ref&gt;Latapi, Augustín and Mercedes González de la Rocha. "Girls, Mothers,and Poverty Reduction in Mexico: Evaluating Progresa-Oportunidades" in Shahra Razavi (ed.), "The Gendered Impacts of Liberalization: Towards 'Embedded Liberalism?' London and New York: Routledge: 267- 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exclusion has been noted by both the World Bank study and the Progresa-[[Oportunidades]] evaluation evident in community-based targeting and self-targeting approaches. In the case of self-targeting, used by Mexico's Progresa-[[Oportunidades]], working women may be excluded from the program because they are unable to miss work to register or accomplish all conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Latapi, Augustín and Mercedes González de la Rocha. "Girls, Mothers,and Poverty Reduction in Mexico: Evaluating Progresa- Oportunidades" in Shahra Razavi (ed.), "The Gendered Impacts of Liberalization: Towards 'Embedded Liberalism?'" London and New York: Routledge: 267- 289.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of community-based targeting, the World Bank study notes that the extremely poor who may live in generally middle-class communities will be excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Fizbein, Ariel and Norbert Shaby. "Conditional Cash Transfers: Reducing Present and Future Poverty." The World Bank. (2009): 1- 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distrust===
Targeted populations' distrust of the program due to lack of adequate information has been noted by at least three case studies to be a leading factor in the CCT programs’ downfalls. The extensive study by the UN Development Programme on Nicaragua's [[Social Protection Network]] (RPS) reveals that the level of distrust of the program was so high that a domestic publicity campaign could have possibly saved the RPS from extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Charity. "Nicaragua's Red de Proteccion Social: An Exemplary but Short-lived Conditional Cash Transfer Program." International Policy Center for Inclusive  Growth, no.17, (2009): 1-42.&lt;/ref&gt; This high level of domestic distrust was due, in part, to efforts to politicize the program.&lt;ref name="Moore, Charity 2009"&gt;Moore, Charity. "Nicaragua's Red de Proteccion Social: An Exemplary but Short-lived Conditional Cash Transfer Program." International Policy Center for Inclusive  Growth, no.17, (2009): 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

One report addressed in the UN Development Programme's study stated that RPS employees were approached by members of the government, who demanded that half their salaries be donated to the party in power. Although the RPS was successful in avoiding the threats, it was later revealed that the RPS was the only Nicaraguan institution of its kind not making government contributions.&lt;ref name="Moore, Charity 2009"/&gt;

This same level of distrust is reflected in a study on the feasibility of a Haitian CCT made by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]]. In the focus group they interviewed, almost all subjects expressed a "profound lack of faith" in the Haitian government. Instead, they preferred that the conditional cash transfer programs be implemented by community committees or [[NGO]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Mark and Dora Weissman. "Implementing a Conditional Cash Transfer Program In Haiti: Opportunities and Challenges." The International Food Policy Research Center. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this distrust in governments' ability to fairly implement CCTs fairly is not strictly limited to developing countries. In an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' addressing the termination of the pilot CCT, [[Opportunity NYC]], the committee leader of one of its lending institutions stated that people were distrustful and confused by the program's intricacies. [[New York City]]'s deputy mayor for health and human services added that many busy and stressed households were not being able to handle the many conditions they had to complete since they were not efficiently educated about the program.&lt;ref&gt;Bosman, Julie. "City will stop paying poor for good behavior." ''The New York Times''. March 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unconditional versus conditional cash transfers==
{{see also|Unconditional cash transfer}}
There is currently much discussion about whether conditionality, or conditions for the cash transfer, is necessary or important to a cash transfer program. Research, such as the pilot conditional cash transfer program in Indonesia called ''Generasi'', examined the importance of conditionality.&lt;ref&gt;Olken, Benjamin A., Junko Onishi, Susan Wong. "Should Aid Reward Performance? Evidence from a Field Experiment on Health and Education in Indonesia." Working Paper, MIT, August 2011. http://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/project-generasi-conditional-community-block-grants-indonesia&lt;/ref&gt;  
One report looks at data from Mexico's Oportunidades/Progresa program, which looks at families who accidentally did not receive forms that monitor school attendance and therefore received unconditional cash transfers. It then compares them with those households that did receive the forms. It was shown that conditionality had the strongest impact on children's attendance to secondary school, as enrollment rates in secondary school were higher for those that received the forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2010.08.014 |ssrn=1011901 |title=Must conditional cash transfer programs be conditioned to be effective? The impact of conditioning transfers on school enrollment in Mexico |journal=Journal of Development Economics |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=359–70 |year=2011 |last1=De Brauw |first1=Alan |last2=Hoddinott |first2=John |authorlink2=John Hoddinott (economist) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another report on an experiment in Malawi is researching the importance of conditionality among families with school-age girls. The program was conducted, with data collected between October 2007 and June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Baird, Sarah, Craig McIntosh, and Berk Ozler. Cash or Condition? Evidence from a Cash Transfer Experiment. Working paper no. 5259. Vol. 45. World Bank, 2010. Print. Impact Evaluation Ser.&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that the treatment arm providing conditional cash transfer programs had higher enrollment rates, as well as higher scores in independently administered tests of cognitive ability, mathematics and English reading comprehension. However, the UCT treatment arm had a much lower incidence of pregnancy and marriage among schoolage girls.

A strong argument against the conditionality of social cash transfers is proposed by proponents of a [[rights-based approach to development]]. From a human rights perspective, cash transfers are a means to ensure the human rights to social protection and an adequate standard of living for all members of society, including first and foremost the fundamental right to food. States have the duty to ensure those rights with a maximum of available resources. While reducing poverty in general, conditional cash transfers have shown to often exclude those who need it the most, violating the human rights principle of non-discrimination and equality.&lt;ref&gt;Künnemann, Ralf and Ralf Leonhard. A Human Rights View of Social Cash Transfers for Achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Brot für die Welt, Evangelischer Entwicklungsdienst, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following program in Malawi is an example of an unconditional cash transfer:

The Mchinji Pilot Social Cash Transfer Scheme is part of the larger Malawi Social Protection Policy and Framework, and began in April 2006. It is mainly financed by [[UNICEF]] and the National AIDS Commission.&lt;ref name="Schubert, Bernd 2006"&gt;Schubert, Bernd, and Mayke Huijbregts. The Malawi Social Cash Transfer Pilot Scheme, Preliminary Lessons Learned. Tech. New York: UNICEF, 2006. Print. Social Protection Initiatives for Children, Women and Families: An Analysis of Recent Experiences.&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives of the scheme are to reduce poverty of people in the pilot area who are ultra poor and labor constrained, increase school enrolment and attendance, and to generate information regarding the feasibility of a cash transfer program as part of a Social Protection Programme for Malawi. The goal for this program is to reduce the ultra poverty rate from the 22% rate in 2007 to 10% by 2015.&lt;ref name="Schubert, Bernd 2006"/&gt;

This program targets those households that are ultra poor (See [[poverty]] for definition) and those who are labor constrained, defined as either a household in which no able-bodied members 19-64 can work due to chronic sickness or disability or a household with one-able bodied member that has to care for more than three dependents. About 22% of Malawi as of 2007 was ultra-poor, living on less than 20 cents a day, and of that group 10% are labor constrained.&lt;ref name="Schubert, Bernd 2006"/&gt;

The program would give anywhere from 600 kwacha ($4 US) monthly for a one-person household to 1800 kwacha ($13 US) monthly for a four or more person family. There is also an extra bonus of 200 kwacha for children enrolled in primary school and 400 kwacha for children enrolled in secondary school.&lt;ref name="Schubert, Bernd 2006"/&gt;
The location for the program is in the Mchinji District, the 14th poorest district out of 28 in Malawi.

It was chosen for its average poverty level of all the districts in Malawi and its proximity to the capital, [[Lilongwe]].&lt;ref name="Schubert, Bernd 2006"/&gt;

The first comprehensive systematic review of evidence on health effects of cash transfers found that the relative effectiveness of conditional and unconditional cash transfers remains very uncertain. The review found only three studies that compared conditional cash transfers with unconditional ones directly, and it recommended additional randomized controlled trials of conditional compared with unconditional cash transfers.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Unconditional cash transfers for reducing poverty and vulnerabilities: effect on use of health services and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=11 |pages=CD011135 |year=2017 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2 |pmid=29139110 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Liu |first2=Sze |last3=Walter |first3=Stefan  |last4=Pabayo |first4=Roman |last5=Saith |first5=Ruhi |last6=Lhachimi |first6=Stefan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Strasbourg-Consistoire supérieur.jpg|thumb|[[EPCAAL]]'s ''Supreme Consistory'' in [[Strasbourg]]]]

==History==
Starting in 1539 the term was used for a body taking over the jurisdiction in marital matters, and later also [[church discipline]], so that Protestant [[wikt:consistory|consistories]] can be regarded as successors not to the [[papal consistory]] in Rome but rather to the courts of Roman Catholic bishops.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2004 846"&gt;''The encyclopedia of Protestantism'', Hans J. Hillerbrand (ed.), New York: Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|0415924723}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Lutheran]] or Reformed states of [[imperial immediacy]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] episcopal offices were not staffed any more and the secular government assumed the function of the bishop (summepiscopate, summus episcopus), looked after by the consistories.

Not all Protestant churches adopted consistories, especially not [[collegiality|collegially]] governed churches, often of [[Continental Reformed church|Reformed]] or [[Presbyterian]] confession. Consistories were either bodies of local churches (mostly in the Reformed tradition), or parastatal entities, like in the French model, or they were governing bodies as part of the administration of Protestant [[state church]]es (Lutheran, Reformed and United Protestant alike).&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2004 846"/&gt; The rather governmental character of the consistory is the reason why the term was given up in many church bodies after the [[separation of religion and state]] and the concomitant abolition of the status as state church and the assumption of church independence.

In countries under French influence the Protestants, Calvinists and Lutherans alike (and the Jews as well, see [[Consistory (Judaism)|Israelite consistories]]), made use of the term in the beginning of the nineteenth century with the enactment of the [[Organic Articles]], when the movement for political emancipation demanded the creation of a representative body, whereas Napoleon's government simultaneously aimed at gaining influence onto the non-Catholic religious bodies. Roman Catholicism in Napoleon's realm was subject to the [[Concordat of 1801]]. The consistories in the French Empire could transact official business with a government in the name of the Protestants and vice versa. Furthermore, the desire for reform among the educated classes demanded the creation of a body vested with authority to render religious decisions.

==Anglican usage==
{{Main|Consistory court}}
"In Anglican churches the consistory is the diocesan court, usually presided over by the bishop's chancellor or commissary. It deals with a variety of issues at the diocesan level, and its decisions may be appealed to higher courts in the national church."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2005 162"/&gt;

==Usage in Lutheran and united churches==
[[File:Berlin Kollegienhaus Aufriss 1738.jpg|thumb|right|[[Prussian Union of churches|APU]]'s ''Berlin Consistory'' sat in the [[Jewish Museum Berlin#History|Collegienhaus]] between 1737 and 1826, sharing it with the [[Kammergericht]], and again from 1913 to 1945 as the sole user.]] In the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] tradition, and derived from that similarly in some [[united and uniting churches|united and uniting Protestant churches]], the consistory is a body governing the ecclesiastical affairs in a specific ambit, comprising either all congregations (aka parishes) within a Protestant church body (thus forming a leading body, with executive and /or spiritual competence for a church), or only those in a district organisation (consistorial district; {{lang-de|link=no|Konsistorialbezirk}}) or in a regional organisation (such as an ecclesiastical province; {{lang-de|link=no|Kirchenprovinz}}).&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2005 162"/&gt; In the latter two cases, typical in churches with a [[congregational polity]], the term consistory is also used to designate the geographical area administered by the consistory.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2005 162"/&gt;

[[File:Piła konsystorz.JPG|thumb|right|[[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union|APU]]'s former ''Posen-West Prussia Consistory'', now the office of an oil and gas drilling company in [[Piła]].]] In 1539 [[Martin Luther]] and his associates established the {{Interlanguage link multi|Wittenberg Consistory|de|3=Konsistorium Wittenberg}} (1539–1816) in [[Wittenberg|Wittenberg upon Elbe]] competent for the Lutheran church in the [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Electoral District|de|3=kurkreis}} within the then realm of the Ernestine line of the [[House of Wettin]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2004 846"/&gt; Although originally an ecclesiastical court of the Saxon Lutheran church, the consistory developed into an administrative body appointed by the sovereign to supervise the church within his state.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2004 846"/&gt; In other Lutheran states the consistories took similar developments.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2004 846"/&gt;

Consistories, forming executive body of a state church, had often great powers through the authority of the secular government.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2005 162"/&gt; In history, before separating executive and juridical competences, consistories of Lutheran state churches with central executive powers, therefore usually consisting of jurisprudents and clergy, did also function as courts appointed to regulate ecclesiastical affairs.&lt;ref name=""&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/consistory#ixzz2jKUAbcpt "Consistory"] (entry), in: ''American Heritage Dictionary'', retrieved on 2 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At times the consistories were parastatal offices in charge of all (Protestant) denominations (e.g. in [[Bremen-Verden]]) or even all religions (e.g. in Prussia, see [[Evangelical Church in Prussia]] from 1808 to 1816) in the respective territory. While Lutheran churches often still did not form legal entities distinct from the state, the consistories turned out to be the oldest body of many modern [[Landeskirche|regional Protestant church bodies]], which developed into independent legal entities in the 18th and 19th centuries.

By the French Organic Articles each time several parishes (paroisses) of the [[EPCAAL]] form a consistory (consistoire), terming the board and its district alike.&lt;ref name="IDL"&gt;Cf. [http://www.idl-am.org/bj_contenu.asp?DocumentID=11 "Etudes: Cultes protestants"], on: [http://www.idl-am.org/ ''Institut du Droit Local Alsacien-Mosellan'' (IDL)], retrieved on 17 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The consistories are {{Interlanguage link multi|religious statutory law corporations|fr|3=Établissement public du culte}} of legal entity status.&lt;ref name="IDL"/&gt; Each consistory holds property of its own and receives contributions by the member parishes.&lt;ref name="IDL"/&gt; Each EPCAAL consistory comprises all the pastors active in its district and the double number of laypersons, elected in three year terms by the local church presbyteries, as well as some members coöpted by the church executive Directory (directoire).&lt;ref name="IDL"/&gt; The consistorial members elect from their midst their executive, the consistorial council (Conseil consistorial) of four members.&lt;ref name="IDL"/&gt; Consistorial decisions are presented to the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|French minister of the Interior]], who may oppose them within a two-months period, and reported to the superior EPCAAL Supreme consistory (Consistoire supérieur).&lt;ref name="IDL"/&gt;

In the [[Continental Reformed church|Reformed]] (Calvinist) tradition the consistory is the authority in the [[local church]], generally made up of all the teaching Elders (ministers) and the ruling elders (lay leaders).&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2005 162"/&gt; The consistory then forms the head of individual congregations (or parishes) also in charge of implementing the policies of the synod and/or assembly of which it is part, and providing for church discipline of the church members where necessary.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2005 162"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weber 1911"&gt;Nicholas Weber, [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12710a.htm "Reformed Churches"], in: ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', vol. 12, New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911, retrieved on 2 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A panel sometimes called the Great Consistory, convoked if considered necessary for special consultations, would include the current consistory and former elders and deacons.&lt;ref name="Weber 1911"/&gt; Congregations (kerkgemeenten) within the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]] rooted in the 2004-merged [[Dutch Reformed Church]] often call their local church councils {{Interlanguage link multi|consistorial chamber|nl|3=consistoriekamer}} or ''consistorie'' (consistory, else also called kerkenraad, i.e. church council).

In weekly meetings the consistory examined people accused of misbehaviour.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2005 162"/&gt; If the charges proved of substance, the consistory had a range of options including referring the person for counselling or, in more severe cases, to the civil courts.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2005 162"/&gt; "In 1555, excommunication was added to its powers."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2005 162"/&gt; About one-fifteenth of the entire adult population of the republic was annually summoned before the consistory.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2004 846"/&gt; As much as Calvin's theology with his emphasis on church discipline, the Genevan Consistory gave the city-state particular and the Reformed Church of Geneva its unique lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Protestantism 2005 162"/&gt;

Also in the [[Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine]] (EPRAL) several parishes form a consistory (consistoire), with the term used for the board and its district alike.&lt;ref name="IDL"/&gt; As religious statutory law corporations the consistories have legal entity status, holding property of their own and receiving contributions from member parishes.&lt;ref name="IDL"/&gt; EPRAL consistories are made up and organised like their EPCAAL counterparts (see above). Unlike their EPCAAL counterparts the EPRAL consistories appoint the pastors after proposition by the [[Presbytery (church polity)|presbytery]] of the concerned parish.&lt;ref name="IDL"/&gt;

==Consistories today==
[[File:Ehemaliges Konsistorium Bachstraße.jpg|thumb|[[Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia|EKBO]]'s ''Berlin Consistory'', former building]] The [[Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia]] (EKBO, a church comprising Lutheran, Reformed and united congregations) uses the term consistory ({{Interlanguage link multi|Berlin Consistory|de|3=Evangelisches Konsistorium (Berlin)}}) for its administrative office. This consistory was founded in 1543 and underwent a number of alterations of its official naming and functions in compliance with the development of the constitution of the church. Also the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia]] and the [[Protestant Church of Luxembourg]] (Consistoire de l'Eglise Protestante du Luxembourg) use the term consistory for their central administrative offices.

The Lutheran [[Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine]] (EPCAAL) maintains its Supreme Consistory (Consistoire supérieur), functioning as the supreme spiritual body, and 40 regional consistories, established in 1802 but later partially reorganised and renamed.&lt;ref name="IDL"/&gt; In the Lutheran [[Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Poland]] the Consistory of the Church ({{lang-pl|link=no|Konsystorz Kościoła}}) serves as the chief administrative authority and the executive board of the synod.&lt;ref name="Konsystorz"&gt;Cf. [http://www.bik.luteranie.pl/pl/konsystorz.html "Konsystorz Kościoła"], on: [http://www.bik.luteranie.pl/pl/strona_glowna.html ''Centrum Informacyjne Kościoła Ewangelicko-Augsburskiego w Polsce''], retrieved on 2 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church]] the consistory (konsistoorium) is the administrative board of the church. In 2006 the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia#Regional churches and congregations|Evangelical Lutheran Church in European Russia]] established a consistory (Консистория) as its central executive body. In the [[Polish Reformed Church|Evangelical Reformed Church in the Republic of Poland]] the administrative body is termed as consistory (Konsystorz). In the [[Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine]] four consistories form district organisations each comprising several parishes.

==Consistories renamed==

* The consistory (Evangelisches Konsistorium) of the [[Evangelical Church in the Rhineland]] was renamed as Landeskirchenamt in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;The consistory, then called supreme consistory with Napoleonic consistories still existing as district organisations of several Protestant congregations (or parishes) each, was founded in 1814 in Düsseldorf as a governmental entity, in 1816 it moved to Cologne and was restricted in its competence to the Protestant congregations in the [[Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]]. For the new [[Lower Rhine Province]] a separate consistory was founded in Coblence in 1816. In 1826 the Cologne consistory was merged into the one at Coblence, then as the Royal Consistory of the Rhine Province. Moved to Düsseldorf in 1934 it was renamed as Regional Church Office (Landeskirchenamt) in 1948. Cf. Stefan Flesch, ''Bestand: Evangelisches Konsistorium der Rheinprovinz'', Düsseldorf: Archiv der Evangelischen Kirche im Rheinland, 2001, p. I.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 the State Consistory was renamed as Landeskirchenamt. Cf. [http://www.archiv.sachsen.de/archive/dresden/4390_3130303838.htm "Oberkonsistorium"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203112144/http://www.archiv.sachsen.de/archive/dresden/4390_3130303838.htm |date=2013-12-03 }}, on: [http://www.archiv.sachsen.de/ ''Sachsen.de: Archivwesen''], retrieved on 2 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The consistory (Evangelisches Konsistorium) of the [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia]] was renamed as Regional Church Office (Landeskirchenamt) in 1948.

==Designations for members==
The designations for the members of consistories alter as to their functions and status as clergy or laymen. In German Konsistorialrat (consistorial councillor) and Konsistorialassessor (consistorial assessor) are each used to term both. Consistories often had double leadership, one lay and one cleric. The lay leader is often called Konsistorialpräsident or Konsistorialdirektor (consistorial president or director), by vocation usually a jurisprudent, while the cleric leaders could be termed Generalsuperintendent or just Superintendent (general superintendent or [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|superintendent]]), or provost (Propst, as with EKBO).

'''Equality Federation''' is a [[social justice]], [[advocacy]] and [[capacity building]] organization serving and supporting state-based [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) advocacy organizations in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="eqfed-about"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://equalityfederation.org/about-us | title=About Us | work=Equality Federation | accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1997, a group of state-based LGBT advocacy organizations came together to form the Equality Federation, which originally operated as a volunteer-run coalition. In 2005, Toni Broaddus joined the Federation as its first executive director, transitioning it to a staffed organization.&lt;ref name="bilerico710"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bilerico.com/2010/07/equality_federation_ed_to_step_down.php | title=Equality Federation ED to step down | work=Bilerico Project | date=July 30, 2010 | accessdate=January 14, 2014 | author=Browning, Bil}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Federation was a staff of four when Broaddus stepped down. After a nationwide search, the board of directors hired Rebecca Isaacs as the organization’s second executive director in 2011.&lt;ref name="ebar111"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=5426 | title=Political Notebook: Equality Federation welcomes new executive director | work=Bay Area Reporter | date=2011-01-27 | accessdate=January 14, 2014 | author=Bajko, Matthew S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Equality Federation is an umbrella group of two separate non-profit organizations. The Equality Federation is a [[501(c)(4)]] membership organization serving organizations who advocate for LGBT equality in nearly all 50 states. The Equality Federation Institute is a [[501(c)(3)]] organization with programs in [[leadership development]], policy advocacy, and organizational development.

The Equality Federation staff is distributed across the United States.

==Programs==
Equality Federation's programs focus on leadership development, policy advocacy, and organizational development.&lt;ref name="ebar111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eqfed-programs"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://equalityfederation.org/programs | title=Programs | work=Equality Federation | accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership development===
Equality Federation staff provide coaching and mentoring to new and experienced executive directors, offer training for staff and board of advocacy organizations, and operate an internship program to connect young people with statewide organizations.&lt;ref name="eqfed-leader"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://equalityfederation.org/building-leaders | title=Building Leaders | work=Equality Federation | accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also hosts two annual events: the New Executive Director Boot Camp and the Summer Meeting. The New Executive Director Boot Camp is attended by new organization leaders for two days of in-depth training.&lt;ref name="eqfed-bootcamp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://equalityfederation.org/blog/201312/new-executive-director-boot-camp-builds-skills-relationships |title=New Executive Director Boot Camp Builds Skills, Relationships |work=Equality Federation |accessdate=January 17, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201153849/http://equalityfederation.org/blog/201312/new-executive-director-boot-camp-builds-skills-relationships |archivedate=February 1, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Summer Meeting provides state-based organization leaders with the opportunity to collaborate and develop working relationships.&lt;ref name="eqfed-13sumtg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://equalityfederation.org/2013-summer-meeting |title=2013 Summer Meeting |work=Equality Federation |accessdate=January 17, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201153912/http://equalityfederation.org/2013-summer-meeting |archivedate=February 1, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational development===
Equality Federation’s organizational development program focuses on strengthening member organizations to ensure they’re sustainable and strategically positioned to advance public policy changes.&lt;ref name="eqfed-orgdev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://equalityfederation.org/strengthening-state-equality-groups |title=Strengthening State Equality Groups |work=Equality Federation |accessdate=January 17, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201155453/http://equalityfederation.org/strengthening-state-equality-groups |archivedate=February 1, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program's offerings include strategic planning services (organizational, advocacy, and fundraising plans), executive search support, and access to online services. The organization also works to create partnerships within and across regions. The Southern Cohort convenes annually at the Southern Leadership Summit to share best practices and form partnerships for working in the [[Southern United States]].

'''Ethyl oleate''' is a [[fatty acid ester]] formed by the [[condensation reaction|condensation]] of [[oleic acid]] and [[ethanol]].  It is a colorless to light yellow liquid.  Ethyl oleate is produced by the body during ethanol intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dan L, Laposata M |title=Ethyl palmitate and ethyl oleate are the predominant fatty acid ethyl esters in the blood after ethanol ingestion and their synthesis is differentially influenced by the extracellular concentrations of their corresponding fatty acids |journal=Alcohol.

Ethyl oleate is used as a solvent for pharmaceutical drug preparations involving [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] substances such as [[steroid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ory SJ, Hammond CB, Yancy SG, Hendren RW, Pitt CG |title=The effect of a biodegradable contraceptive capsule (Capronor) containing levonorgestrel on gonadotropin, estrogen, and progesterone levels |journal=Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. |volume=145 |issue=5 |pages=600–5 |year=1983 |pmid=6402933 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also finds use as a lubricant and a [[plasticizer]].  [[Louis Bouveault]] used ethyl oleate to demonstrate [[Bouveault–Blanc reduction]], producing [[oleyl alcohol]] and [[ethanol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Bouveault |first1 = Louis |authorlink1 = Louis Bouveault |last2 = Blanc |first2 = Gustave Louis | journal = [[Bull.

Ethyl oleate is regulated as a food additive by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] under "Food Additives Permitted for Direct Addition to Food for Human Consumption", [[21CFR]]172.515.

Ethyl oleate has been identified as a primer [[pheromone]] in [[honeybee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leoncini I. |title=Regulation of behavioral maturation by a primer pheromone produced by adult worker honey bees|journal=Proc.

Ethyl oleate is one of the [[fatty acid ethyl esters]] (FAEE) that is formed in the body after ingestion of ethanol. There is a growing body of research literature that implicates FAEEs such as ethyl oleate as the toxic mediators of ethanol in the body (pancreas, liver, heart, and brain).&lt;ref name="Laposata 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Laposata M.|title=Fatty acid ethyl esters: nonoxidative metabolites of ethanol|journal=[[Addiction Biology]]|year=1998|volume=3|pages=5–14 |doi=10.1080/13556219872308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Laposata M.| title = Fatty acid ethyl esters: current facts and speculations | journal = Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids | year = 1999 | volume = 60 | issue = 5&amp;6 | pages = 313–315 | doi = 10.1016/S0952-3278(99)80005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Laposata M | title = Fatty acid ethyl esters: recent observations | journal = Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids | year = 2002 | volume = 67 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 193–196 |name-list-format=vanc | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1054/plef.2002.0418 | last2 = Hasaba | first2 = Ali | last3 = Best | first3 = Catherine A. | last4 = Yoerger | first4 = Danita M. | last5 = McQuillan | first5 = Brendan M. | last6 = Salem | first6 = Raneem O. | last7 = Refaai | first7 = Majed A. | last8 = Soderberg | first8 = Britt L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the speculations is that ethyl oleate may be the toxic mediator of alcohol in [[fetal alcohol syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Laposata 1998"/&gt; The oral ingestion of ethyl oleate has been carefully studied and due to rapid degradation in the digestive tract it appears safe for oral ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Saghir M. | title = Rapid in vivo hydrolysis of fatty acid ethyl esters, toxic nonoxidative ethanol metabolites | journal = Am J Physiol | year = 1997 | volume = 273 | pages = G184–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethyl oleate is not currently approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] for any injectable use. However, it is used by compounding pharmacies as a vehicle for intramuscular drug delivery, in some cases to prepare the daily doses of [[progesterone]] in support of pregnancy. Studies which document the safe use of ethyl oleate in pregnancy for both the mother and the fetus have never been performed.

A '''Factory-kitchen''' or '''kitchen factory''' ({{lang-ru|Фабрика-кухня}}) was a large mechanized enterprise of [[food service]] in the [[Soviet Union]], originated in 1920-1930s. Its main purpose was centralized preparation of food (both prefabrication and full processing) supplied for communal dining rooms or for personal purchase. Factory-kitchens were characteristic of their unique architecture. Sometimes the term is inadequately translated as '''communal kitchen''', the latter being a kitchen in a Soviet [[communal apartment]].

The idea of centralized food preparation was part of the emancipation of the women from the household work in early Soviet Union, and to better tap into women's workforce. Along with the [[house-commune]]s (дом-коммуна), factory-kitchens were to get rid of "the yoke of the household economy". Slogans of the day were "Away with Pots and Pans!" and "The Saucepan is an Enemy of the [[party cell|Party Cell]].&lt;ref name= stites&gt;[[Richard Stites]],  ''The Women's Liberation Movement in Russia: Feminism, Nihilism, and Bolshevism, 1860-1930'', 1978, {{ISBN|0691100586}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qy679HV7AmkC&amp;q=kitchen#v=snippet&amp;q=kitchen&amp;f=false p. 409]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various propagandists explained how "a single person can prepare from fifty to hundred dinners a day".&lt;ref name= stites/&gt; A children's book ''A Cook for a Whole City''&lt;ref&gt;Т.Габбе, З.Задунайская.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2411">'''FreeRight''' ({{lang-it|LiberaDestra}}, '''LD''') is a [[liberal conservatism|liberal-conservative]] political association in [[Italy]].

LD was launched by [[Gianfranco Fini]], former leader of the [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI), [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] (AN) and [[Future and Freedom]] (FLI), former [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|minister of Foreign Affairs]], former deputy prime minister and former [[List of Presidents of the Italian Chamber of Deputies|president]] of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]], in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2013/10/09/news/fondazione_liberadestra_fini-68263753/&lt;/ref&gt;

The association's leading principles are [[patriotism]] (i.e. not [[nationalism]]), [[legality]], [[liberty]] and [[European integration]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liberadestra.com/finalita/&lt;/ref&gt; In Fini's words, "if the political and cultural community of the right is able to work in the near future to express original ideas in line with its traditional values and if new leaders emerge, the political right will resume its path in a credible way" and he "will try [...] to give a contribution of ideas and proposals in order to define the countenance of an Italian right finally alike [...] to several European formations."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liberadestra.com/il-progetto-politico-culturale/&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, Fini has long hinted that he might return to active politics and expressed interest in the creation of a party representing both the traditional and the "moderate" right, as opposed to the "populism" supposedly espoused by [[Brothers of Italy]] and [[Lega Nord]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/politica/11688510/Gianfranco-Fini-torna-in-politica-.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liberadestra.com/fini-sono-pronto-lavorare-per-una-nuova-destra-anti-le-pen-e-di-governo-il-leader-ancora-non-ce/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liberadestra.com/e-ora-un-confronto-di-idee-e-non-di-insulti/&lt;/ref&gt; AN's historical nemesis.

The '''National Surveillance Unit''' ('''NSU''') ({{lang-ga|Aonad Faireacháin Náisiúinta}}) is the principal clandestine [[Intelligence assessment|intelligence gathering]] and [[surveillance]] operations unit of the ''[[Garda Síochána]]'', the national police force of Ireland. The unit operates under the '''[[Garda Crime &amp; Security Branch|Crime &amp; Security Branch]]''' ('''CSB'''), based at Garda Headquarters in the [[Phoenix Park]], Dublin, and also works from [[Harcourt Street railway line|Harcourt Street]], Dublin. Members of the unit are specially trained and selected Detective Gardaí who are tasked to remain covert whilst on and off duty, tracking suspected criminals, terrorists and hostile, foreign spies operating in Ireland. The unit's detectives are routinely armed. The National Surveillance Unit is understood to possess a manpower of approximately 100 officers, and is considered to be the most secretive arm of the force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Keeffe|first=Cormac|title=Surveillance in the spotlight|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2009/0420/world/surveillance-in-the-spotlight-89703.html|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mooney|first1=John|title=Security lapses by garda agents|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/ireland/News/article1032602.ece|accessdate=3 June 2014|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Garda National Surveillance Unit was formed in the mid-1990s, when the "Crime Special Surveillance Unit" and the "Crime Ordinary Surveillance Unit" were merged. It is the operational wing of the '''Security &amp; Intelligence Section''' (S&amp;I) of the [[Garda Crime &amp; Security Branch|Crime &amp; Security Branch]] (CSB). The unit is headed by a [[Chief superintendent|Detective Chief Superintendent]], who is under the supervision of the [[Assistant commissioner|Assistant Commissioner]] in charge of the Crime and Security Branch. It is understood to have a strength of about 100 [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] officers, mainly detectives, who all carry firearms (standard issue is the concealable [[Walther P99]]c 9mm semi-automatic pistol). The unit is headquartered in the Phoenix Park, but carries out many operations from Harcourt Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garda Management Journal ("Communique)|url=http://www.garda.ie/Documents/User/communique%20november%2008.pdf|work=20 November 2008|publisher=Garda Síochána (www.garda.ie)|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSU has personnel nationwide, and works closely with the [[Special Detective Unit]] (SDU) as well as Garda [[Intelligence analysis|analysts]] or "techies" in other Garda regions, although often local Gardaí are unaware of the presence of the NSU operating in their area.

Increasingly, the NSU is using [[Signals intelligence|technical and electronic espionage]] rather than [[Human intelligence (intelligence collection)|physical and human intelligence]], working with the SDU and [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (Ireland)|Directorate of Military Intelligence]] (G2) of the Irish [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]], mainly to counter terror, militant and subversive groups in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Garda tells trial of 'sensitive' surveillance operation|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/garda-tells-trial-of-sensitive-surveillance-operation-176332.html|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Breaking News Ireland|date=17 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as serious crime (particularly drug trafficking) and the activities of hostile foreign governments on Irish soil ([[counterintelligence]]).

The Garda NSU is considered the most covert unit of the force, and according to the Department of Justice: ''"It is the policy of An Garda Síochána not to comment on any matters relating to the operation of the National Surveillance Unit."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Justice and Equality {{!}} Written answers on Garda Strength|url=http://www.kildarestreet.com/wrans/?id=2014-02-25a.1167|work=25 February 2014|publisher=Kildare Street|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Ghost Teams"===
The Garda NSU operates a small number of "Ghost Teams" or "Ghost Units", which conduct so-called ''"[[Black bag operation]]s"'', whereby a team of officers will break into a property upon possession of a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] and plant [[Covert listening device|bugs]] to gather intelligence or evidence against suspected serious criminals, terrorists or hostile spies without their knowledge, and without leaving a trace (hence the name "Ghost Team").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacGuill|first1=Dan|title=State surveillance: How Gardaí and others can secretly monitor you|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/preview.php?article_id=2099537&amp;preview_type=post|accessdate=12 July 2015|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of these teams came to public attention following the publishing of The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2009/en.act.2009.0019.pdf|work=2009|publisher=Government of Ireland|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment and technology used by the NSU is highly sophisticated and very expensive, but is also kept secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barry|first1=John|title=The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009: An Examination of the Compatibility of the New Act With Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|url=http://corkonlinelawreview.com/editions/2010/CRIMINAL%20JUSTICE-BARRY.pdf|publisher=Cork Online Law Review|accessdate=3 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606223411/http://corkonlinelawreview.com/editions/2010/CRIMINAL%20JUSTICE-BARRY.pdf|archivedate=6 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cusack|first=Jim|title=Hi-tech snooping on crime gangs can be child's play|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/hitech-snooping-on-crime-gangs-can-be-childs-play-30013732.html|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=The Sunday Independent|date=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The National Surveillance Unit has been involved in a number of high-profile Garda operations, though rarely are the unit named, and they do not appear in public.

* In '''August 1998''', the [[Real Irish Republican Army|Real IRA]] terrorist organisation detonated a [[car bomb]] in [[Omagh]], [[Northern Ireland]] (see [[Omagh bombing]]), killing 29 people and injuring 220 others. It was the single deadliest terrorist attack ever carried out on the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]], and all the casualties were innocent members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bomb atrocity rocks Northern Ireland|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/151985.stm|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=16 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, claims were made by [[whistleblower]]s that the Garda National Surveillance Unit had obtained intelligence three weeks prior to the bombing that a stolen car would be used by the Real IRA in an attack on a town in Northern Ireland, and failed to pass this information on to the then [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC), in order to protect the identity of an [[informant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McDonald|first=Henry|title=Omagh agent claims Garda let bomb pass|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/oct/26/northernireland.politics|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=The Observer|date=19 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims have been strenuously denied by both the Garda Síochána and [[Government of Ireland|Irish government]], although subsequent investigations suggest that had the Gardaí and RUC pooled their resources, the attack may have been prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cowan|first=Rosie|title=Irish police accused on Omagh|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/oct/26/northernireland.politics|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infiltration of [[dissident republican]]s by the Gardaí, RUC, [[MI5]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) led to five foiled terrorist attacks in the same year, including a thwarted "spectacular" bombing of the [[Grand National|Aintree Grand National]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cusack|first=Jim|title=Communication 'muddle' blamed for Omagh bomb, Confusion among spy agencies led to carnage|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/communication-muddle-blamed-for-omagh-bomb-26340589.html|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''December 2001''', NSU Detective Sergeant '''John Eiffe''' – aged 40 from [[Ratoath]], [[County Meath]] – lost his life in tragic circumstances after he was hit from a bullet [[ricochet]] fired by a colleague from the [[Garda Emergency Response Unit|Emergency Response Unit]] (ERU) during an operation to arrest four armed bank robbers in [[Abbeyleix]], [[County Laois]]. The four men had been under surveillance by NSU detectives, and when they attempted to rob a bank, the NSU and Emergency Response Unit intervened. One of the men attempted to flee using his vehicle, and the sound of a tyre bursting led officers at the scene to believe they were being fired on by the armed robbers, causing them to open fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Guerin |first=Jimmy |title=The tragic day a young Garda died |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/the-tragic-day-a-young-garda-died-26245908.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140429210858/http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/the-tragic-day-a-young-garda-died-26245908.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |newspaper=Independent.ie |date=24 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It later transpired that although the criminals had been carrying firearms, they had not discharge them. Gardaí discharged all 3 shots. Another officer was also injured in the incident, but recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Felle|first=Tom|title=Inquest into garda death at bank raid delayed due to appeals|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/inquest-into-garda-death-at-bank-raid-delayed-due-to-appeals-25916176.html|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=8 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''May 2009''', NSU detectives shot and killed an armed raider in [[Lucan, Dublin|Lucan]], [[County Dublin]] after he attempted to hold-up a cash-in-transit van. 27-year-old Gareth Molloy, who had previous criminal convictions, and his gang were under surveillance by the NSU for a number of weeks prior to the incident. Gardaí received intelligence that the gang were going to carry out a heist, and the NSU were backed-up by the [[National Bureau of Criminal Investigation]] (NBCI), [[Organised Crime Unit]] (OCU) and ERU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trial hears garda evidence of surveillance of cars|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/trial-hears-garda-evidence-of-surveillance-of-cars-555546.html|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=breakingnews.ie|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Molloy and a gang associate attempted to hold-up a cash delivery van at gunpoint and fired a shot in the air, NSU detectives intervened and ordered the armed raiders to drop their weapons. Gareth Molloy pointed a sawn-off shotgun in the direction of armed Gardaí and was immediately fired upon by NSU officers and was fatally wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phelan |first=Shane |title=Armed raider opened fire on gardai |url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/armed-raider-opened-fire-on-gardai-26536426.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140429210943/http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/armed-raider-opened-fire-on-gardai-26536426.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |newspaper=Irish Independent |date=27 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His associate refused to drop his weapon, and was also shot, but survived with serious injuries. 5 shots were fired by Gardaí in total. No one else was hurt. Four other gang members were arrested, charged and jailed following a pursuit in the aftermath of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Undercover gardai had followed raid gang for two weeks|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/undercover-gardai-had-followed-raid-gang-for-two-weeks-27911890.html|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=The Herald|date=16 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''March 2013''', NSU detectives were carrying out physical surveillance on dissident republicans when a former leader of the Real IRA terrorist group, Peter Butterly, aged 35, was assassinated by his own gang&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Real IRA chief shot by former associates|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/crime/ex-real-ira-chief-peter-butterly-1748965|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Irish Mirror|date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; outside of a [[pub|public house]] in [[Gormanston, County Meath|Gormanston]], County Meath, unaware of the presence of onlooking [[intelligence officer]]s. Five men were arrested at or close to the scene at gunpoint by the NSU, backed-up by the SDU and ERU, and three were charged with his murder, as well as terrorism offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Armagh leader of 'New IRA' ordered Co Meath murder in row over cash|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/armagh-leader-of-new-ira-ordered-co-meath-murder-in-row-over-cash-29116828.html|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=The Belfast Telegraph|date=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that the Gardaí had an [[Undercover operation|undercover officer]] planted in the gang, who was being backed-up by armed officers nearby, and that he had to break his cover in the aftermath of the shooting to apprehend members of the gang. An NSU team had planted a [[GPS tracking unit|tracking device]], following secret judicial approval, on the car in which their undercover officer was travelling in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gardaí seek privacy screen for surveillance operatives in murder trial|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/gardai-seek-privacy-screen-for-surveillance-operatives-in-murder-trial-643950.html|accessdate=23 November 2014|publisher=breakingnews.ie|date=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armed Gardaí were forced to ram one vehicle to stop it fleeing the scene.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2415">'''Gay Voter's League''' of San Francisco is a defunct political organization of [[LGBT]] Americans who campaigned for both Republican and Democratic candidates.

In 1971 former members of San Francisco's [[Gay Activists Alliance]], headed by Reverend Ray Broshears, formed the Gay Voters' League. The group sought to include conservative candidates, which put it at odds with other LGBT political organizations at the time.&lt;ref name="Gay Voters' Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/sfbagals/Gay_Pride_Crusader/1978_Gay_Crusader_No66_Nov01.pdf |title=Gay Voters' Guide |publisher=San Francisco Cruisader |date= |accessdate=July 29, 2018 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the group campaigned for the re-election of President Richard Nixon&lt;ref name="Republican Party (United States) gay rights"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/republican_party.html |title=Republican Party (United States) |publisher=Glbtq.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703032944/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/republican_party.html |archivedate=July 3, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for seven other candidates (four Republicans and three Democrats).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/10252975/league-due-nixon-pitch|title=League due Nixon pitch|date=|publisher=Connection.ebscohost.com|accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1972, representative of the Committee to Re-elect the President addressed gay voters on behalf of Richard M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1578">The '''General Land Exchange Act of 1922''' (16 U.S.C. 485, 486) was signed into law by  President of the United States [[Warren G. Harding]] on March 20, 1922&lt;ref&gt;Steen p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;
This act allowed the [[US Forest Service]] to consolidate its holdings in national forests where a large percentage of private lands were intermingled with forest lands. It made possible the exchange of [[inholdings]] within national forests for private lands of equal value and within the same state.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

This act also made for better management and administration in accordance with future planning initiatives because the process of a mutually desirable exchange was greatly simplified by this legislation to a matter of just signing papers.

Chief Forester [[William B. Greeley]] predicted in 1922 that "this law would probably be regarded as one of the half-dozen most important laws affecting the National Forests."&lt;ref&gt;Steen  p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harlan Lane''' (born 19 August 1936) is an American psychologist. Lane is the Matthews Distinguished University Professor of [[Psychology]] at [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], in the [[United States]], and founder of the Center for Research in Hearing, Speech, and Language {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. His research is focused on speech, [[Deaf culture]], and [[sign language]]. 

Lane was born in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Harlan, Ben Bahan, and Bob Hoffmeister. 1996. ''A Journey into the Deaf-World''. San Diego, C.A.: DawnSignPress, 1996. {{ISBN|0915035634}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining in New York City for college, he obtained both a B.S. and an M.S. in Psychology from Columbia University in 1958. He subsequently received a PhD. in Psychology from Harvard (1960) and a ''Doc. des Lettres'' from the [[Sorbonne]] (1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harlan Lane, Psychologist and Linguist|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/438/|website=MacArthur Fellows Program|publisher=MacArthur Foundation|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Lane received a [[MacArthur Foundation Fellowship]].&lt;ref name="northeastern"&gt;Lane, Harlan.

Lane, a hearing man, has become an often controversial spokesman for the [[Deaf community]] and critic of [[cochlear implants]]. He has written extensively on the [[social construction of disability]] and states that "Unless Deaf people challenge the culturally determined meanings of ''deaf'' and ''disability'' with at least as much vigor as the technologies of normalization seek to institutionalize those meanings, the day will continue to recede in which Deaf children and adults live the fullest lives and make the fullest contribution to our diverse society."&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Harlan. 2008.

Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. {{ISBN|978-0816646197}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his research and advocacy regarding these issues, Lane has received the Distinguished Service Award from the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)]], the International Social Merit Award from the [[World Federation of the Deaf]], and numerous other awards.&lt;ref name="northeastern"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harlan Lane Receives George Veditz Award|url=https://cos.northeastern.edu/news/harlan-lane-receives-george-veditz-award/#_ga=2.255162177.819720292.1522699098-1869302799.1522699098|publisher=Northeastern University, College of Science|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is ''Commandeur de l'Ordre des [[Palmes Académiques]]'', the highest level of the academic honor given out by the French government.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Bakke]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Regents of the University of California v. Bakke|link=|volume=438|page=265|pin=|year=1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hopwood'', four [[white people|white]] plaintiffs who had been rejected from [[University of Texas at Austin]]'s [[University of Texas School of Law|School of Law]] challenged the institution's admissions policy on equal protection grounds and prevailed. After seven years as a [[precedent]] in the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], the ''Hopwood'' decision was [[Repeal|abrogated]] by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=Grutter&gt;{{ussc|name=Grutter v. Bollinger|link=|volume=539|page=306|pin=|year=2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The case==
After being rejected by the [[University of Texas School of Law]] in 1992, Cheryl J. Hopwood filed a federal lawsuit against the University on September 29, 1992, in the [[U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas]]. Hopwood, a white female, was denied admission to the law school despite being better qualified (at least under certain metrics) than many admitted minority candidates. Originally, Hopwood's co-plaintiff was Stephanie C. Haynes, but Haynes was dismissed from the suit on February 11, 1993. Ultimately, three white males, Douglas Carvell, Kenneth Elliott, and David Rogers, joined the existing lawsuit as plaintiffs. All had better combined [[LSAT]] and grade scores than 36 of the 43 Latinos admitted, and 16 of the 18 black students admitted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/1997-11-25/news/cheryl-hopwood-vs-state-of-texas/&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Judge [[Sam Sparks]], a 1963 graduate of the University of Texas School of Law, presided over the case.

''[[Texas Monthly]]'' editor [[Paul Burka]] later described Cheryl Hopwood as "the perfect [[plaintiff]] to question the fairness of [[reverse discrimination]]" because of her academic credentials and her personal hardships (she has a young daughter suffering from a muscular disease).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Burka |first1=Paul| title=Law • Cheryl Hopwood| url= http://www.texasmonthly.com/content/law-%E2%80%A2-cheryl-hopwood |work =Texas Monthly| date=September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an eight-day [[bench trial]] in May 1994, Judge Sparks issued his ruling on August 19, 1994. He determined that the University could continue to use the racial preferences which had been at issue in the litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Hopwood v. State of Texas |vol=861 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=551 |pinpoint= |court=W.D. Tex. |date=1994 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/861/551/2261859/ |accessdate=2017-12-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ruling, he noted that while it was "regrettable that affirmative action programs are still needed in our society", they were still "a necessity" until society could overcome its legacy of institutional racism. Thereupon, the four plaintiffs appealed the case to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard oral arguments in the case on August 8, 1995.

Nearly two years after the original trial, on March 18, 1996, the Fifth Circuit issued its opinion, which was written by Circuit Judge [[Jerry Edwin Smith]]. The court held that "the University of Texas School of Law may not use race as a factor in deciding which applicants to admit in order to achieve a diverse student body, to combat the perceived effects of a hostile environment at the law school, to alleviate the law school's poor reputation in the minority community, or to eliminate any present effects of past discrimination by actors other than the law school". Judge [[Jacques L. Wiener, Jr.]], concurred. Rehearing was denied on April 4, 1996.

The University appealed the decision to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], which declined to review the case on July 1, 1996. In an opinion on the denial of ''[[certiorari]]'', Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], joined by Justice [[David Souter]], noted that the issue of the constitutionality of race in admission was "an issue of great national importance".&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Texas v. Hopwood|link=|volume=518|page=1033|pin=|year=1996|el=no}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Justice Ginsburg explained that the University was no longer defending the specific admissions policy that had been at issue in the lawsuit and was rather attempting to justify only the rationale for maintaining a race-based admissions policy. Accordingly, because the Supreme Court reviews judgments and not opinions, Justice Ginsburg stated that it "must await a final judgment on a program genuinely in controversy before addressing the important question raised in this petition". Thus, the ''Hopwood'' decision became the final law of the land with respect to the use of race in admissions in [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Texas]], the three states over which the Fifth Circuit has jurisdiction.

==The reaction==
University officials were not pleased with the opinion. Shortly after the opinion's release, UT President [[Robert Berdahl]] predicted "the virtual resegregation of higher education," while UT System Chancellor William Cunningham noted that administrators were "saddened by the 5th Circuit's sweeping determination that ''Bakke'' is no longer the law of the land and that past discrimination and diversity no longer justify affirmative action in admissions".&lt;ref&gt;Merle, Renae. "Court rules against affirmative action at UT law school", ''[[Daily Texan]]'', March 19, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fifth Circuit's opinion [[catalyzed]] a discussion of race in admissions on campus. Faculty and students protested. For the next several years, the case was a popular topic of discussion and debate in ''[[The Daily Texan]]'', the University's student newspaper.

The Texas legislature passed the [[Texas House Bill 588|Top Ten Percent Rule]] governing admissions into public colleges in the state, partly in order to mitigate some of the effects of the Hopwood decision.

==Later developments==
On January 15, 1997, [[William P. Hobby, Jr.]], former [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas]] and then Chancellor of the [[University of Houston System]], sought a clarification of the application of ''Hopwood'' from Texas Attorney General [[Dan Morales]]. Specifically, Hobby questioned how the new federal jurisprudence would affect financial aid at institutions of higher education in Texas (and in particular, its effect on specific programs of the [[University of Houston]]&amp;mdash;mainly admissions to the [[University of Houston Law Center]]). On February 5, 1997, Morales issued his formal opinion in response to Hobby's request. Morales found that "Hopwood's restrictions would generally apply to all internal institutional policies, including admissions, financial aid, scholarships, fellowships, recruitment and retention, among others".&lt;ref&gt;Tex. Atty. Gen. Op. LO-97-001, Mr. William P. Hobby (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, under the Morales interpretation, ''Hopwood'' was extended to prevent the consideration of race in areas beyond admissions.

On June 23, 2003, the Supreme Court abrogated ''Hopwood'' in ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', in which the high court found that the [[United States Constitution]] "does not prohibit the law school's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body".&lt;ref name=Grutter/&gt; The ruling means that universities in the Fifth Circuit's jurisdiction can again use race as a factor in admissions (as long as quotas are not used, per ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Gratz v. Bollinger|link=|volume=539|page=244|pin=|year=2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8724">The '''International Meteorological Organization''' ('''IMO'''; 1873–1951) was the first organization formed with the purpose of exchanging weather information among the countries of the world. It came into existence from the realization that weather systems move across country boundaries; and that knowledge of pressure, temperature, precipitations, etc. upstream and downstream is needed for [[weather forecasting]]. It was superseded by the [[World Meteorological Organization]]

== History ==
There had been significant developments in [[meteorology]] in the 19th century. [[C. H. D. Buys Ballot]]'s 1872 paper ''Suggestions on  a  Uniform  System  of  Meteorological Observations'' led to the idea of forming  the International Meteorological Organization in 1873.&lt;ref name="Buys-Ballot1872"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buys-Ballot|first=Christoph Heinrich Diedrich|authorlink=C.

[[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], of the [[US Navy]], initiated the convening of the first true International Meteorological conference from late August through early September 1853.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/fam/0945.html Memories of the Bureau Of Meteorology Chapter 2: International Meteorology]&lt;/ref&gt; The Conference opened its proceedings at [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], on the 23d August 1853, in the residence of M. Piercot, the Minister of the Interior. The Governments represented at the first International Conference, and the names of the officers who attended were :
*[[Adolphe Quetelet]], director of the ''[[Royal Observatory of Belgium]]'' and general secretary of the ''Academie royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts'' with Victor Lahure, navy captain and general director of the Navy, represented [[Belgium]].
*P. Rothe, navy captain and director of the depot of marine charts represented [[Denmark]].
*A. De la Marche, hydrographic engineer for the imperial navy represented [[France]].
*[[Frederick William Beechey]], captain [[Royal Navy]] and member of the Naval Department or the Board of Trade with Henry James, captain royal engineers represented the [[United Kingdom]].
*[[Marin H. Jansen]], lieutenant of the Royal navy represented the [[Netherlands]].
*Nils Ihlen, lieutenant of the royal navy represented [[Norway]].
*J. De Mattos Corroêa, captain-lieutenant of the Royal navy represented [[Portugal]].
*Alexis Gorkovenko, captain-lieutenant the Imperial navy represented [[Russian Revolution|Russia]].
*Carl Anton Pettersson, first lieutenant royal navy represented [[Sweden]].
*[[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], lieutenant of the [[United States Navy|Navy]] represented the [[United States]].

This meeting was followed by an International Meteorological Congress in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]], in September 1873 which agreed to prepare for an ''International Meteorological Organization'' (''IMO''). The members of that organization would be the directors of national meteorological services. A Permanent Meteorological Committee was established with [[C. H. D. Buys Ballot|Buys Ballot]], director of [[Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute|the Dutch meteorological service]], becoming the first president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://www.wmo.ch/Documents/PublicWeb/amp/mmop/documents/JCOMM-TR/J-TR-27-BRU150-Proceedings/DOCUMENTS_JCOMM_27/Session_2/2_2_Sarukhanian.pdf|title=The International Meteorological Organization (IMO) 1879-1950|author=E. I. Sarukhanian and J.M. Walker|publisher=[[WMO]]|accessdate=2011-06-04}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second congress in [[Rome]] 1879 decided on the IMO establishment and elected an International Meteorological Committee to prepare for the next Conference of Directors. There was however no separate funding. Also the directors agreed on a collaborative research effort with the [[International Polar Year]] 1882-1883. The first International Meteorological Tables were published in 1889.

The 1891 Conference of Directors of Meteorological Services convened in [[Munich]]. The organization was further refined by electing an Executive Bureau and deciding upon the first permanent topic commission, the Commission for Terrestrial Magnetism.

The 1896 Conference of Directors in [[Paris]] established more commissions: the Commission for Radiation and Insolation, and the Commission for Aeronautics. At the same year IMO published the first [[International Cloud Atlas]].

In 1905 the Conference of Directors convened in [[Innsbruck]]. [[Léon Teisserenc de Bort]] proposed a telegraph-based worldwide weather station network, the ''[[wikt:network|Réseau]] Mondial''. Simplifying Teisserenc de Bort’s vision, the IMO decided that the network should collect, calculate, and distribute monthly and annual averages for pressure, temperature, and precipitation from a well-distributed sample of land based on meteorological stations, in effect a global climatological database. The distribution
standard was two stations within each ten-degree latitude/longitude quadrangle. Ultimately, the network comprises about 500 land stations between 80°N and 61°S. The first annual data set, for 1911, appeared in 1917.

Between the two world wars there were four further Conferences of Directors, 1919 in Paris, 1923 in Utrecht, 1929 in Copenhagen and 1935 in Warsaw. The IMO did not acquire a permanent secretariat until 1926, and the latter’s annual budget never exceeded USD 20,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/Osiris22-Edwards.pdf|title=Meteorology as Infrastructural Globalism|author=Paul N. Edwards|accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1929 the Copenhagen Conference of Directors set up a technical Commission For Climatology, which held a meeting at Innsbruck discussing issues such as the relationship between dynamic meteorology and climatology. At its 1934 Wiesbaden meeting the Commission designated the thirty-year period from 1901 to 1930 as the reference time frame for climatological standard normals. the baseline for measuring climate fluctuations.&lt;ref name="WMO history"&gt;{{cite web | title=Commission For Climatology: Over Eighty Years of Service |year=2011 | publisher=World Meteorological Organization | url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/ccl/documents/WMO1079_web.pdf |format=pdf |pp=6, 7–8 | accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1946 Conference of Directors acknowledged the need for an organisation supported by governments. Preparations continued with conferences in 1947 in Washington DC and 1961 in Paris. In 1951 the [[World Meteorological Organization]] became a specialized agency of the [[United Nations]] in direct succession of the IMO. The members of the WMO are representatives of their respective countries, not their weather services.

'''Jonathan Keith "Jack" Idema''' (May 30, 1956{{spaced ndash}}January 21, 2012) was a former U.S. Army reserve special operations non-commissioned officer. In September 2004 he was found guilty of running a private prison in [[Afghanistan]] and torturing Afghan citizens. At the time, Idema had been portraying himself as a [[U.S. government]]-sponsored [[United States Special Operations Forces|special forces operative]] on a mission to apprehend [[terrorist]]s. However, the U.S. government has repeatedly denied most of such claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/23/world/us-army-accepted-afghan-prisoner-from-vigilante-suspect.html |title=U.S. Army Accepted Afghan Prisoner From Vigilante Suspect |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2004-07-23 |author=[[David Rodhe]] |accessdate=2010-10-18 |quote=American military officials said they took the Afghan man into custody because Mr. Idema identified him as a terrorist wanted by American forces.

Idema was raised in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], graduating from high school there in 1974. In February 1975 he enlisted in the U.S. Army. His father H. John Idema, a former [[United States Marine|Marine]] and [[World War II]] [[veteran]], believed that his son was a "dedicated American".&lt;ref name="pride prison"&gt;{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Barnes |authorlink= |author= |title=Pride, prison shadow Idema |url=http://www.fayettevillenc.com/story.php?Template=news&amp;Story=6446821 |format= |work=Article ID: 6446821 |publisher=The Fayetteville Observer |date=July 10, 2007 |accessdate=2007-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301031149/http://www.fayettevillenc.com/story.php?Template=news&amp;Story=6446821 |archivedate=March 1, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Operation Desert Fraud"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sullivan |first=Stacy |title=Keith Idema's Operation Desert Fraud |publisher=New York Magazine |date=2004-10-04 |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/10121/ |accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; H. John Idema died in November 2008.&lt;ref name="john idema obit"&gt;{{cite web |title=H.

==Military service==
There is a discrepancy between what Idema says his military experience was as a member of the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] and what is stated in his official military record. Idema has repeatedly stated on television, radio, and in writing that he acquired 12 years of Special forces service, 22 years of combat training, and 18 years of covert operations experience.&lt;ref name="pownetwork"/&gt;

Idema's military career was short and contained several reports of poor performance, with no record that he acquired any combat experience{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Two years after enlisting in the Army in 1975, he qualified for the Special Forces.&lt;ref name=pownetwork&gt;{{cite web |last=Robberson |first=Tod |title=Records seem to discredit self-proclaimed Special Forces expert. ... .Out of service since '84, man accused in Afghan case never saw combat |work= |publisher=Dallas Morning News |date=2004-08-30 |url=http://www.pownetwork.org/phonies/phonies204.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027110556/http://www.pownetwork.org/phonies/phonies204.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-10-27 |doi= |quote=According to a copy of his military records, Mr. Idema trained and qualified for Special Forces in 1977. Mr. Idema then switched to reserve status, where he remained until he left the Army in 1984. There is no record of any combat service. |accessdate=2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his military record obtained in the course of his 1994 fraud trial, after serving one term of service Idema was not allowed to reenlist, likely due to poor performance. He had received numerous negative remarks from superior officers in addition to participating in three [[Nonjudicial punishment|non-judicial punishment]] proceedings. Idema was cited for "failure to obey orders, being derelict in the performance of his duty, and being disrespectful to a superior commanding officer."&lt;ref name="military record"&gt;{{cite web |last=King |first=Mary F. |title=Facsimile of a memorandum regarding Jonathan Keith Idema | publisher=United States District Court, Eastern District of North Carolina |date=June 15, 1994 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/img/2005/ep01/fi_parolereport.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One superior officer, Capt. John D. Carlson stated that Idema "is without a doubt the most unmotivated, unprofessional, immature enlisted man I have ever known."&lt;ref name="military record"/&gt;&lt;ref name="idemaarmyrec"&gt;{{cite book |last= Young Pelton |first=Robert |authorlink= |title=Licensed to Kill: Hired Guns in the War on Terror |publisher=Random House |year=2006 |location= |pages=241 |url= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he was given an honorable discharge and allowed to join the [[United States Army Reserve]] 11th Special Forces Group working to provide logistical support.&lt;ref name="paintball business"/&gt; In a November 1, 1980 [[letter of reprimand]], Major Paul R. Decker wrote that Idema "consistently displayed an attitude of noncooperation with persons outside his immediate working environment, disregard for authority and gross immaturity characterized by irrationality and a tendency toward violence."&lt;ref name="military record"/&gt; In January 1981, Idema was relieved of his Army Reserve duties, his last position was the assistant sergeant of operations and intelligence.&lt;ref name="military record"/&gt; After leaving the Army reserves, he became a member of the [[Individual Ready Reserve]] until he left the military completely in 1984.&lt;ref name="pownetwork"/&gt;

==Business interests==
Several years after he left the Army, Idema became involved in the [[paintball]] business, opening a paintball supply and equipment company in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]], named Idema Combat Systems. He later segued that business into a paramilitary clothier and supply company operating under the same name.&lt;ref name="paintball business"&gt;{{cite news|first=Kim |last=Sengupta |title=Bad company: 'Jack' Idema and the bounty hunters of Kabul |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20040711/ai_n12757575 |publisher=The Independent on Sunday |date=July 11, 2004 |accessdate=2007-03-07 |quote=Back in America, however, Idema, known as Keith rather than Jack, was known for another type of combat – paintball. He ran a magazine called Paintball Planet and produced "combat helmets" for the game.

Sometime in the early 1980s Idema founded Counter Group (also known as US Counter-Terrorist Group), a business entity which, according to its website, specializes in expert training for counter-terrorism, assault tactics and other security-related services.&lt;ref name="UScounterr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counterterroristgroup.us/ |title=Counter-Terrorist Group |accessdate=2007-03-29 |work=Official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409003541/http://www.counterterroristgroup.us/ |archivedate=2007-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counter Group's legal status and ownership is questionable – according to a ''Soldier of Fortune'' article published in 2004, Idema is mentioned as the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Brass |title=After a Lifetime of Skating on the Edge, Has Keith "Jack" Idema Finally Slid Over? |url=http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,SOF_0804_Idema,00.html |publisher=Soldier of Fortune |date=August 2004 |accessdate=2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company website lists a PO Box address Lafayettele, but there is no record of the company's registration in that state. However, a company called "Counter Group, Inc." was incorporated in 1997 by William L. London, a lawyer who has represented Idema in several lawsuits. (The status for this company is listed as "suspended" as of 2004.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.secretary.state.nc.us/corporations/Corp.aspx?PitemId=4674028 |title=Record for Counter Group, Inc. |accessdate=2007-06-04 |work=North Carolina Secretary of State }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only company in North Carolina registered to Jonathan Idema is Idema Combat Systems, which according to state records was incorporated in January 1991 and dissolved in July 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=

Bumback,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.networksolutions.com/whois/results.jsp?domain=counterterroristgroup.us |title=WHOIS search results for counterterroristgroup.us |accessdate=2007-06-04 |format= |work=Network Solutions }}&lt;/ref&gt; a business associate of Idema's who is believed to be the company's current director.&lt;ref name="fbi investigation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mooreclaims"/&gt; There is a record of Counterr Group being formed in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1983, but the company is listed as "inactive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://appsext8.dos.state.ny.us/corp_public/CORPSEARCH.ENTITY_INFORMATION?p_nameid=957548&amp;p_corpid=860591&amp;p_entity_name=%43%6F%75%6E%74%65%72%72%20%47%72%6F%75%70&amp;p_name_type=%25&amp;p_search_type=%42%45%47%49%4E%53&amp;p_srch_results_page=0 |title=NYS Department of State Division of Corporations Entity Information: Counterr Group, Inc. |accessdate=2007-06-04 |work=New York State Department of State |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928121321/http://appsext8.dos.state.ny.us/corp_public/CORPSEARCH.ENTITY_INFORMATION?p_nameid=957548&amp;p_corpid=860591&amp;p_entity_name=%43%6F%75%6E%74%65%72%72%20%47%72%6F%75%70&amp;p_name_type=%25&amp;p_search_type=%42%45%47%49%4E%53&amp;p_srch_results_page=0 |archive-date=2008-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Idema also owned a company called Special Operations Exposition and Trade Show Inc which hosted organized conventions for military equipment suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Greenwood |first= Al |title= Jury Awards Former Soldier 1.8 Million |newspaper= Fayetteville Observer |pages=1A, 5A |date=2001-08-16 |url=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two other known companies – Isabeau Dakota, Inc. and Star America Aviation Company, Ltd. – that have connections to Idema. The latter claims to be an aviation support company founded in July 2008 with operations based out of [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name="star america aviation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starair.us |title=STAR America Aviation Services Group |accessdate=2008-08-20 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both companies are registered to William "Skip" London in North Carolina,&lt;ref name="isabeau dakota"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.secretary.state.nc.us/corporations/Corp.aspx?PitemId=4772619 |title=Record for Isabeau Dakota, Inc. |accessdate=2008-08-20 |work=North Carolina Secretary of State }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.secretary.state.nc.us/corporations/Corp.aspx?PitemId=8945040 |title=Record for Star America Aviation Company, Ltd. |accessdate=2008-08-20 |format= |work=North Carolina Secretary of State }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Isabeau Dakota is listed a [[shell company]]; its last annual report, filed in 2002, identifies "H. John Idema" (Idema's father) of Poughkeepsie, New York as president and sole officer, and it lists no significant assets or business activity.&lt;ref name="isabeau dakota"/&gt; The website for Star America Aviation is also registered to Bumback&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.networksolutions.com/whois/results.jsp?domain=starair.us |title=WHOIS search results for StarAir.us |accessdate=2008-08-20 |format= |work=Network Solutions }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the websites for Counterr Group and Star America Aviation are very similar, including the use of imagery depicting Idema, while he was in Afghanistan and prior to his arrest.&lt;ref name="UScounterr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="star america aviation"/&gt;

==Fraud conviction==
In addition to his occasional entrepreneurial pursuits, Idema has a substantial criminal record. Over the years Idema has been charged with impersonating an officer, conspiracy, passing bad checks, assault, possession of stolen property, and discharging a firearm into a dwelling. In January 1994, Idema was arrested and charged with 58 counts of wire fraud defrauding 59 companies of about $260,000. He was convicted of the charges, sentenced to six years in prison (paroled after having served three years) and was subsequently ordered to pay restitution.&lt;ref name="paintball business"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mooreclaims"/&gt;

==Lawsuits==
Idema was involved in multiple lawsuits,&lt;ref name="NYT_obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "LATimes_obit" /&gt; including suits against journalists, an aid worker, a colonel, his father,&lt;ref name= "economist_obit"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21545973 Jonathan Keith “Jack” Idema], ''The Economist,'' Feb 4th 2012, (Retrieved 8 Feb. 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States government. A prominent lawsuit was against [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures|Dreamworks Studios]], in which Idema contended that he was the basis of a character in the 1997 Dreamworks film "[[The Peacemaker (1997 film)|The Peacemaker]]".&lt;ref name="crimelibrary"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Adventures of Jonathan Idema in Kabul|publisher=Court TV|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/cops_others/jonathan_idema/3.html|accessdate=2006-12-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007140316/http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/cops_others/jonathan_idema/3.html|archivedate=2006-10-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim was dismissed, and Mr. Idema was ordered to pay $267,079 in legal fees.&lt;ref name="NYT_obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Asianfanatics"&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |title=U.S. Says American Detainees Not Beaten |publisher=Yahoo News, reposted on asianfanatics.net forum |date= August 24, 2004 |url=http://asianfanatics.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=27650 |accessdate=2006-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2001, a jury awarded Idema $781,818 for property damage and $1 million for punitive damages. The award came after a jury decided that a property manager improperly sold some of his belongings while Idema was serving his fraud sentence. Two property managers were hired by Idema to take care of a building that housed equipment for two of his businesses, Special Operations Exposition and Trade Show Inc., and Idema Combat Systems. According to the lawsuit, equipment was missing, damaged or destroyed, and holes were punched in the walls of the building. Idema sued both property managers and their wives on April 10, 2000, but everyone except for one property manager was later dropped from the suit.&lt;ref name="Idema settlement2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Idema settlement1" /&gt;  Idema never collected the 1.8 million because the property manager that was found liable declared bankruptcy and Idema settled for 650,000 dollars that he obtained through law suits filed against insurance carriers. Idema's father was the insured.&lt;ref name="Idema settlement2" /&gt;

In June 2005, an investigator sued Idema alleging that he wasn't paid when Idema won the 1.8 million dollar lawsuit. The investigator claimed that Idema orally agreed to pay 15% of any amount collected, he also claimed that Idema failed to pay court reporters, expert witnesses, and others who helped him with his case.&lt;ref name="Idema settlement1" /&gt;

==Lithuania and nuclear weapons smuggling==
In 1993 Idema was contracted to train police forces in the former Soviet republic of [[Lithuania]]. After his return, he contacted officials from both [[the Pentagon]] and the [[FBI|Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)]], claiming to have uncovered a conspiracy by the [[Russian Mafia]] to smuggle nuclear material out of Lithuania. According to Idema, FBI agents demanded he provide the names of his contacts. He refused, claiming that the FBI was infiltrated by KGB agents and that his sources would have been killed.&lt;ref name="Operation Desert Fraud"/&gt;

It was around this time that Idema was being investigated for wire fraud and eventually convicted in 1994. Idema asserted that the fraud charges were fabricated by FBI agent [[Earl Edwin Pitts]], who he claims supervised the case against him, in retaliation for Idema's earlier refusal to provide sources in the smuggling plot.&lt;ref name="Newsmax"&gt;{{cite web|last=Farber |first=Barry |title=The Case of Keith Idema |work=Newsmax |publisher= |date=2004-07-22 |url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/7/22/105010.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130130051511/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/7/22/105010.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-30 |accessdate=2006-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the FBI began their investigation into Idema's activities as early as May 1991, before he even approached the Bureau about Lithuania.&lt;ref name="fbi investigation"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bergen |first=Peter |title=Jack Idema: The Shadow Warrior |work= |publisher= |url=http://www.peterbergen.com/bergen/articles/details.aspx?id=219 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003416/http://www.peterbergen.com/bergen/articles/details.aspx?id=219 |archivedate= 27 September 2007 |accessdate= 25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there is no evidence that Pitts was involved in any capacity in the fraud case against Idema.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Afghanistan==

===Entry and credentials===
[[Illegal entry]] into Afghanistan was one of the charges leveled against Idema and two other Americans accompanying him – former soldier [[Brent Bennett]] and [[television]] [[journalist]] [[Edward Caraballo]]. That charge was eventually dropped.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Idema first traveled to Afghanistan in November 2001 to conduct what he said was "humanitarian relief" work.&lt;ref name="nov01"&gt;{{cite news |first=J.S. |last=Newton |title=Fayetteville man in Afghanistan |url= |work=Article ID: 750924 |publisher=The Fayetteville Observer |date=November 27, 2001 |accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that he involved himself in the research [[Robin Moore]] was conducting for his book ''The Hunt for Bin Laden''. He was actually working for [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] with [[Gary Scurka]].

According to Gary Scurka, a reporter for [[CBS News]], Idema contacted him a few weeks after the September 11 terror attacks and announced he was going to Afghanistan to do humanitarian-aid work, saying he was to work with [[Knightsbridge International]] and the [[Partners International Foundation]], two aid groups run by former military personnel.&lt;ref name="Operation Desert Fraud"/&gt; This led to Scurka and Idema presenting a film documentary project for ''National Geographic.''&lt;ref name="pelton"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pelton |first= |title=Licensed to Kill (op. cit.) |publisher= |location= |pages=233 |url= |doi= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Idema, Gary Scurka, and Greg Long traveled to [[Tashkent, Uzbekistan]], where they were arrested for visa problems and held in a cell overnight. The three were freed after their captors received a letter from the US embassy in Uzbekistan, written by an officer in the US Defense Attache's Office, describing Idema and Scurka as "contracting officers from the Defense Department who arrived to the Republic of Uzbekistan for an official trip." The letter, which was verified as authentic by the director of the Department of State's press office, was dated November 2, 2001, and asks Uzbekistan's ministry of foreign affairs for help in issuing visas to Idema, Gary Scurka, and Greg Long.&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt;

Greg Long was a member of Partners International Foundation. Idema then joined Partners International Foundation at the same time Scurka received a National Geographic assignment to produce a documentary on humanitarian aid work in Afghanistan. A memo signed by the president of National Geographic TV says Scurka would be going to Afghanistan with KnightsBridge International, and the leader of KnightsBridge, [[Edward Artis]], would be working with Idema. Artis was sued by Idema.&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{Cite news |last= Barnes |first= Greg |title= Embassy letter opened doors |newspaper= Fayetteville Observer |pages= 1A, 5A |date=2004-08-22 |url= |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Robert Young Pelton]] believes that Idema then used those letters and what appears to be a falsified or modified military ID. Idema claimed he had a visa similar to those carried by US special forces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: Jonathan 'Jack' Idema |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-09-15 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3569552.stm| accessdate=2007-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to convince the Afghan commanders and other people of his official status.&lt;ref name="Dog of War"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dog of War |publisher=Asia Times Online |date=2004-08-21 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/FH21Ag02.html |accessdate=2007-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pelton |first= |title=Licensed to Kill (op. cit.) |publisher= |location= |pages= |url= |doi= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Idema entered Afghanistan, both humanitarian organizations quickly became wary of Idema's intentions. In December 2001, [[Edward Artis]], director of Knightsbridge, wrote to U.S. Army Special Operations Command warning them of Idema's activities, stating:

{{quote|[Idema] is a very dangerous person by virtue of his carelessness and stupidity, and before he gets someone killed ... he needs to be removed from the area. I feel that given the amount of time that he has been allowed to run around telling people he has been working for the U.S. Embassy, Pentagon, Special Ops under cover or the CIA, that he has garnered or bought enough contacts to pose a real threat to not only me and those near me but the over all mission of the United States and the Coalition that is fighting there.&lt;ref name="pownetwork"/&gt;}}

Idema later filed suit against Artis and Knightsbridge but the case was dismissed and a monetary judgement was in turn placed against him.&lt;ref name="pownetwork"/&gt;

===Activities===
Idema led a group he called "Task Force Saber 7" consisting of two other Americans and several Afghans. The group may have been operating in Afghanistan with independent financial backing or with funds from two lawsuit settlements Idema had won a few years earlier, one of which was for $1.8 million.&lt;ref name="Idema settlement1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Al |last=Greenwood |authorlink= |author= |title=Fayetteville man sues Idema |url=http://www.fayobserver.com/article_archive?id=1010770 |format= |work= |publisher=The Fayetteville Observer |pages= |page= |date=July 3, 2005 |accessdate=2007-04-09 |language= |quote= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071022064444/http://www.fayobserver.com/article_archive?id=1010770 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Idema settlement2"&gt;{{cite news |first=Al |last=Greenwood |authorlink= |author= |title=Jury awards former soldier $1.8 million |format= |work=Article ID: 727104 |publisher=The Fayetteville Observer |pages= |page= |date=August 16, 2001 |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently interacted with reporters, often going to great lengths in his interviews to stress connections with the [[CIA]] and Special Forces. Some supporters suggest that he was a former member of an unspecified [[covert operations]] unit, reactivated and positioned in Afghanistan to hunt for [[Osama Bin Laden]] under operation [[Bin Laden Issue Station|Alec Station]]. Relationship to the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]] was denied by their official representative in the United States.

Some critics of Idema claim that his attempts to create a high profile with the media make it unlikely that Idema was officially connected with any branch of the military; covert operatives go to great lengths to avoid public appearances and media, and are barred from unauthorized contact. The fact that Caraballo, who was not a soldier, was with Idema in Afghanistan to document his activities strained credibility that Idema was operating covertly.&lt;ref name="cnn_cooper"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0407/20/acd.00.html |title=Anderson Cooper 360 Degrees |accessdate= |work=CNN broadcast transcript |quote=Do secret warriors, people working in black ops, do they usually have cameramen following them?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Idema was known to have a volatile temper that seemed to be particularly directed against news correspondents assigned to Kabul. On several occasions, Idema threatened journalists with bodily harm or death, and in one particular instance, at a dinner in December 2001 he threatened to kill a reporter from ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' because the reporter had disclosed Idema's fraud conviction.&lt;ref name="washtimes2"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ehrlich |first=Richard S. |title=U.S. mercenary made his mark with viciousness |publisher=The Washington Times |date=August 28, 2004 |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20040827-110028-6263r.htm |accessdate=2007-03-30 |quote=In one truly terrifying display, Mr. Idema threatened to murder an American reporter working for Stars and Stripes newspaper after the journalist revealed that Mr. Idema served time in a U.S. prison several years earlier for a "white-collar crime."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been recorded that Idema did frequently contact the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] through the front office of General [[William G. Boykin]] in the Pentagon, and that his information was duly acknowledged. However, all of those contacts were outside the US Military operating channels, and were all one-sided calls from Afghanistan via his Idemas personal  Satellite Phone. Boykins office repeatedly asked Idema to stop making these unsolicited phone calls, because they were disruptive; time consuming; and Boykin could not be of assistance. Idema continued calling Boykins office to establish some sort of self-serving relationship, until his arrest. While the US government was aware of Idema's activities in Afghanistan, they stated there was unequivocally no relationship between them.

The United States Central Command stated that Coalition forces received one detainee from Idema on May 3, 2004. Idema claimed that the individual was associated with the Taliban. Once in US custody, however, the detainee was determined not to be who Idema claimed, and was released in the first week of July.&lt;ref name="Central Command News Release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcent.army.mil/media_releases/2004/july/jul22_02.asp |title=News Release No. 04-07-43: Detainee Received from Jonathan Keith Idema |date=July 22, 2004 |accessdate=2007-02-15 |work=Headquarters United States Central Command |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060728224439/http://www.arcent.army.mil/media_releases/2004/july/jul22_02.asp |archivedate=July 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States was not the only government that had contact with Idema in Afghanistan; On three occasions, Idema tricked the Canadian led NATO mission into providing explosives experts and bomb sniffing dogs.&lt;ref name="ISAF"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mercenaries dupe ISAF soldiers in Afghanistan |publisher=CBC News |date= 2004-07-15 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/mercenaries-dupe-isaf-soldiers-in-afghanistan-1.483341 |accessdate= 2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a spokesman for the [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]], Idema called for and received technical support after his vigilante team raided compounds on June 20, 22, and 24 of 2004. ISAF personnel believed they were "providing legitimate support to a legitimate security agency."&lt;ref name="ISAF"/&gt;

Idema also received assistance from [[Yunus Qanooni]]; former minister, senior Afghan government security advisor, and influential member of the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]].&lt;ref name="Taipei"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2004/08/24/2003200009 |title=Footage gives credence to torture suspects' claims |accessdate=2007-03-10 |work=Taipei Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one video tape presented at Idema's trial, Yunus Qanooni thanked Idema for uncovering an assassination plot against him. In the same tape Qanooni volunteered his personal security troops to help Idema with arrests.&lt;ref name="Constable"&gt;{{cite news |first=Pamela |last=Constable |title=Alleged Vigilantes Show Footage of Afghan Operations U.S. Defendants Seen Meeting Officials |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A25353-2004Aug23 |publisher=Washington Post |date=2004-08-24 |accessdate=2007-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another tape appeared to show Qanooni's forces assisting Idema in a house raid.&lt;ref name="Taipei"/&gt;

On July 4, 2004, the [[United States Central Command]] released a media advisory that read:

{{quote|U.S. citizen Jonathan K. Idema has allegedly represented himself as an American government and/or military official. The public should be aware that Idema does not represent the American government and we do not employ him.&lt;ref name="cnn_cooper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Central Command News Release July 2004"&gt;{{cite web |title= Detainee Received from Jonathan Keith Idema |publisher=Headquarters United States Central Command |date=2004-07-22 |url=http://www.arcent.army.mil/media_releases/2004/july/jul22_02.asp |accessdate=2006-12-26 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060728224439/http://www.arcent.army.mil/media_releases/2004/july/jul22_02.asp  |archivedate= 2006-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In perhaps the most terse assessment of Idema's alleged involvement in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], [[Billy Waugh]], senior CIA covert operative and decorated former [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] who was a member of the Agency-run [[Jawbreaker (military operation)|"Jawbreaker"]] team, said:

{{quote|We only had 80 guys involved in our [Afghanistan] operations and Idema wasn't one of them.&lt;ref name="pelton_waughquote"&gt;{{cite book |last= Pelton| first= |authorlink= |title= op. cit.| publisher= |location= |pages= 239| url= |doi= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Arrest, trial and sentencing===
Idema and his associates [[Brent Bennett]] and Edward Caraballo were arrested on July 5, 2004, by Afghan police during a raid in which they found eight Afghan men (some hanging from their feet) bound and hooded in detention. The arrest of Idema occurred only about three months after ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' broke the story about the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal.

Idema claimed to have had private contact with Lieutenant General Boykin and several other senior Pentagon officials, and at his trial introduced taped conversations with staff of General Boykin's office, although not directly with Boykin himself.&lt;ref name= "gall_2004" /&gt; In the conversations, the staff members say that they will pass Idema's information along to proper authorities.  However, the judge stated that the videos were "inconclusive" and that he lacked concrete, documentary evidence. American Embassy officials stated that as far as they knew neither Mr. Idema nor anyone in his group was working for a government agency, and the military issued statements saying Idema was impersonating government or military officials and did not represent either.&lt;ref name= "gall_2004" /&gt;

He tried further to prove his official status when he claimed to be working for the US Counter Terrorism group, the same group that some sources say he founded.&lt;ref name="Private jail"&gt;{{cite news |last= Denyer| first= Simon |title=Private Jail Leads to Trial |publisher=Washington Post |date=2004-08-16 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A3653-2004Aug15 |accessdate=2007-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed his group had prevented assassination attempts on Education Minister [[Yunus Qanooni]] and Defense Minister Marshal [[Mohammad Qasim Fahim]]. He also claimed the FBI interrogated several militants captured by his group and that after his arrest, the FBI removed from his premises hundreds of videos, photos and documents. Some of the pieces were later returned to Idema and his defense team. One of the videotapes shows Afghanistan's former education minister [[Yunus Qanooni]] thanking Idema for the arrest of two people, and offering his full cooperation in future raids.

The Defense Department's only official contact with Idema was accepting one prisoner who was held for a month by the US military&lt;ref name="AsiaLink"&gt;{{cite web |last= Tulley |first= Andrew |title=US now linked to 'vigilantes' in Afghanistan |publisher=Asia Times Online |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/FG24Ag01.html |accessdate=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but added that officials declined his offer to work with the government in capturing terror suspects in Afghanistan. In early 2004, Idema was in contact with Heather Anderson, the Pentagon's Acting Director of Security. Anderson was under the supervision of the chief official responsible for intelligence matters in Donald Rumsfeld's office. Idema told the Afghan court that Anderson commended his work but Anderson said she later turned down Idema's request to work in Afghanistan for the Pentagon. Idema continued to contact Anderson's office in hopes of establishing a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= North |first= Andrew |title= US admits 'bounty hunter' contact |publisher=BBC News |date=August 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3601030.stm |accessdate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Idema, Caraballo and Bennett were charged with entering the country illegally, running a private prison, and torture.&lt;ref name="Operation Desert Fraud"/&gt; Idema's American attorney was [[John Tiffany]]. During the trial, Idema charged that he, Caraballo, and Bennett were being beaten while in Afghan custody; however, US authorities stated the men were being treated humanely.

On 15 September 2004, a three-judge Afghan panel headed by Judge Abdul Baset Bakhtyari sentenced both Idema and Bennett to a ten-year prison term, while Caraballo received eight years.&lt;ref name= "gall_2004"&gt;Gall, Carlotta (Sept. 16, 2004). [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/16/world/asia/mercenaries-in-afghan-case-get-8-to-10-years-in-prison.html "Mercenaries in Afghan Case Get 8 to 10 Years in Prison"], ''New York Times.'' . Retrieved 2017-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Idema and Bennett's sentences were later cut to five and three respectively. Caraballo claimed he was filming Idema and Bennett for a [[Documentary film|documentary]] on [[counterterrorism]]. Four Afghans working with Idema were sentenced to between one and five years imprisonment.

Caraballo was later pardoned by President [[Hamid Karzai]] and later returned to the United States. Bennett was freed early for good behavior on September 30, 2006.

Caraballo's lawyer said that the day before Caraballo left Afghanastan, Caraballo and Bennett lived in a filthy 6 by 8-foot cell with four suspected Al Qaida terrorists; the American prisoners were moved to a different prison for better protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Barnes |title=Idema moved to new prison |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=FV&amp;p_theme=fv&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=idema%20AND%20date(all)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(%22idema%22)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no |work=Article ID: 965377 |publisher=The Fayetteville Observer |date=September 25, 2004 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent assessment, the cell in which the prisoners lived was described as "posh".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Barnes |title=Court cuts Idema time |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=FV&amp;p_theme=fv&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=idema%20AND%20date(all)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(%22idema%22)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no |work=Article ID: 996570 |publisher=The Fayetteville Observer |date=April 1, 2005 |accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amnesty and refusal to leave prison===
On April 10, 2007, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Idema would soon be released from prison and then sent back to the United States, and that the Afghan government had granted him amnesty.&lt;ref name="release"&gt;{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Apuzzo |title=Idema to leave Afghan prison |url=http://www.fayobserver.com/article?id=259510 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022065107/http://www.fayobserver.com/article?id=259510 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 22, 2007 |work=Associated Press |publisher=The Fayetteville Observer |date=April 11, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the amnesty that commuted his sentence he was effectively released on April 4.

Idema refused to leave the prison, first demanding that his passport, personal effects, and documents that he says proves his official connection with the US government be returned to him. According to him, he was owed compensation for $500,000 worth of equipment, mostly computers, weapons and cameras, that was confiscated by the Afghan government when he was arrested.&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=American convict decides to stay in Afghan jail despite president's pardon |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/05/29/asia/AS-GEN-Afghan-US-Prisoner.php |work=Associated Press |publisher=International Herald Tribute |date= May 28, 2007|accessdate=2007-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having obtained through the offices of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul a new passport as well as money to apply for a visa to [[India]], Idema insisted that his belongings be returned and that a pet dog previously owned by Bennett be allowed to travel with him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''J.K. Idema, et al., v. Ronald Neumann, et al.'', No.5 CV 2064 (EGS), United States District Court for the District of Columbia, "Reply Memorandum in Support of Respondents' Motion to Dismiss on Grounds of Mootness"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''J.K. Idema, et al., v. Ronald Neumann, et al.'', No.5 CV 2064 (EGS), United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Exhibit 1: "Supplemental Declaration of Edward P. Birsner."&lt;/ref&gt;

Idema also filed another lawsuit against the US government, reaffirming allegations initially made in 2005 that he and his associates had been illegally imprisoned, except that this time, Idema was claiming that he was tortured. According to US District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, "Petitioners allege that United States officials ordered their arrest, ordered their torture, stole [[exculpatory evidence]] during their trial and appeal, exerted undue influence over Afghan judges, and either directly or indirectly ordered judges who found petitioners innocent not to release petitioners from prison." This was a shift from the earlier strategy on the part of Idema to exonerate himself on the basis that he was acting on a Pentagon-approved mission. Instead the focus was on the trial itself, specifically whether or not due process was observed, with the added claim of being a torture victim. In both instances Idema accused the U.S. government of deliberately withholding information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=US 'to release Kabul trial files' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3568670.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=August 16, 2004 |accessdate=2007-07-04  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Sullivan subsequently ordered the FBI and the [[US Department of State]] to answer the allegations. Attorneys from the [[US Justice Department]] have requested the case be dismissed on the grounds that Idema's sentence had been commuted.&lt;ref name="release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="legal petition"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Afghanistan set to release American convicted of torturing detainees |url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/04/afghanistan-set-to-release-american.php |work=University of Pittsburgh School of Law |publisher=Jurist |date=April 10, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422210533/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/04/afghanistan-set-to-release-american.php |archivedate=April 22, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Idema's lawyer said the government coordinated Idema's amnesty to avoid having to respond to allegations of misconduct.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Y! release"&gt;{{cite news|first=Matt |last=Apuzzo |authorlink= |author= |title=Imprisoned terrorist hunter to be freed |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070410/ap_on_go_ot/afghan_us_prisoner |format= |work= |publisher=Yahoo |pages= |page= |date=2007-04-10 |accessdate=2007-04-20 |quote= }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Idema's allegations of withheld evidence were originally made during his Afghan trial in 2004. When the men were arrested in early July, the tapes were confiscated by the FBI. Caraballo's lawyer, Michael Skibbie, claims that he was only allowed to access a portion of the tapes weeks after he requested access. Several of the tapes were used; however, Skibbie said several important tapes were damaged, missing or partly erased after the FBI took custody of them. Some of the footage Skibbie obtained was shown in court. The court tapes showed Idema being greeted at an airport by high level Afghan officials, Idema being thanked by [[Yunus Qanuni]], Qanooni's troops working with Idema, captured suspects confessing during interrogation, and ISAF forces helping Idema.&lt;ref name="Constable"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AsiaLink"/&gt;

As he was playing out his legal options, Idema said that another reason he hadn't left was because he feared for his life, ostensibly at the hands of the Afghan government. "I could drive through the Policharki [sic] gates right now. Then what happens? I get arrested. [The intelligence service] will arrest me for not having an Afghan visa and they'll torture me and kill me. If I'm lucky, I'm only going to be tortured," he said.&lt;ref name="iht"/&gt;
On June 2, 2007, Idema left the prison and was immediately flown out of the country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Personal life==

After leaving Afghanistan, Idema moved to Mexico to become a proprietor of Blue Lagoon Boat Tours out of [[Bacalar, Quintana Roo|Bacalar]], on the Yucatan Peninsula, under the name of "Black Jack".&lt;ref name="NYT_obit" /&gt; He was charged by his former girlfriend Penny Alesi of infecting her with [[HIV]] when he knew he had the disease.&lt;ref name="NYT_obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alesi" /&gt; His arrest warrant and publicity surrounding the wife beating charges were picked up in a number of local Mexican newspapers and the US media, including Wired Danger Room,&lt;ref name="Beckhusen"&gt;Beckhusen, Robert (Jan 26, 2012).

Retrieved 9 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Virginian Pilot and {{YouTube|pHD1FRjHhJQ|Rachel Maddow on MSNBC}} as well as blogs.&lt;ref name="alesi"&gt;Alesi, Penny (Jan. 18, 2011).

Retrieved 9 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed to have had nine wives, according to Alesi, although only one of them may have been legal, and at his death, he was listed as having no immediate survivors.&lt;ref name="NYT_obit" /&gt;

According to his father's obituary notice, Idema is said to be a "Green Beret with an organization involved in the War on Terror."&lt;ref name="john idema obit"/&gt;

==Relationship with the media==
Idema had some success convincing members of the media that he was a terrorism expert. This allowed him to secure interviews and in some instances get his "terrorism videos" broadcast on television. After indicating to journalists that he had the videos in his possession, he would usually agree to provide them in exchange for money.&lt;ref name="mooreclaims"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pelton |first= |authorlink= |title=Licensed to Kill (op. cit.) |publisher= |location= |pages=237–238 |url= |doi= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Idema's questionable history has come to light, the news media has been criticized for its willingness to distribute any content or information coming from him.

==Questionable behavior==
At the center of the controversy is Idema's claim that while in Afghanistan he was acting on behalf of the U.S. government and that he was an advisor to the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]]. At other times, Idema told people he was in Afghanistan doing [[humanitarian assistance|humanitarian work]] or that he was a "security consultant" for journalists.&lt;ref name="fbi investigation"/&gt; He also actively sought media attention for himself and his activities – to the point of offering interviews in return for payment – even though he himself said he was operating covertly.&lt;ref name="mooreclaims"&gt;{{cite web |last=Blake |first=Mariah |author2=A.G.

Many believe Idema to be a [[con artist]] or [[impostor]], based on his refusal or inability to demonstrate verifiable proof for his claims, on legal records that contradict his assertions about his background, as well as on a prior conviction for mail fraud and a history of criminal activity. Some have suggested that he may also be [[delusional]] in having concocted a fantasy-type personality for himself as a highly trained [[covert operative]] combating international terrorism, despite a brief and mostly non-notable military record (which states that Idema was in the [[United States Special Forces|Special Forces]] strictly in a support capacity).&lt;ref name="paintball business quote"&gt;{{cite news |first=Kim |last=Sengupta |title=Bad company: `Jack' Idema and the bounty hunters of Kabul |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article46767.ece |publisher=The Independent on Sunday |date=July 11, 2004 |accessdate=2007-03-10 |quote=Records show that Idema served with the 11th Special Forces Group as a "rigger" – essentially a supporting role ensuring that equipment and supplies reached those in the frontline. |location=London }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion was echoed by Major Scott Nelson, the U.S. military spokesperson in Kabul at the time of Idema's arrest in 2004.&lt;ref name="washtimes3"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ehrlich |first=Richard S. |title=U.S. mercenary made his mark with viciousness |publisher=The Washington Times |date=August 28, 2004 |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20040827-110028-6263r.htm |accessdate=2007-03-30 |quote="He was operating by himself there with the delusion that he was able to do great things for the world," Maj. Nelson said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge in Idema's 1994 fraud trial also questioned Idema's psychological state and ordered him to undergo evaluation prior to his sentencing. The report said that while he was not "mentally ill", Idema had a "personality disorder which would affect his interaction with persons exhibiting similar traits, such as supervisors, attorneys, doctors, judges and other persons in positions of power or authority."&lt;ref name="pride prison"/&gt;

In the early 1990s, Idema said he had uncovered a plot by the [[Russian mafia]] to smuggle [[nuclear weapons]] out of [[Russia]]. Before that he said he participated in covert operations in [[Latin America]]. Furthermore, he said that as a soldier he parachuted out of airplanes accompanied by his dog Sarge, who was also trained as a bomb-sniffer. (Idema reportedly saved Sarge's genetic material with the hopes of later cloning the pet.)&lt;ref name="nytimes portrait"&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Rohde |title=Portrait of a U.S. Vigilante in Afghanistan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/11/world/portrait-of-a-us-vigilante-in-afghanistan.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=July 11, 2004 |accessdate= 2007-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Idema was not without his supporters, usually found among [[blog]]s sympathetic to his situation. The contributors to these blogs believe that he is being unjustly punished for actions condoned, if not officially sanctioned, by the U.S. military. However, there has been little support for Idema's claims in general media outlets. Indeed, many members of the media who encountered Idema while they were on assignment in Afghanistan regard him as a fraud.&lt;ref name="mooreclaims"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washtimes"/&gt;

===Lithuania===
In 1995, while Idema was awaiting sentencing for fraud charges, he agreed to provide information to [[CBS News]] about the nuclear materials smuggling plot he allegedly uncovered. Gary Scurka produced a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' piece entitled "The Worst Nightmare", based in part on Idema's account. According to Scurka, the network declined to credit Idema during the broadcast because of the fraud conviction, even though he was a major source for the story. A CBS spokesperson claimed that the story took 6 months to fully investigate, by which time it was very different from the one Idema gave.&lt;ref name="mooreclaims"/&gt; Both the ''60 Minutes'' story and a companion piece published in ''[[US News and World Report]]'' received the prestigious "[[Renner Award]] for Outstanding Crime Reporting".&lt;ref name="mooreclaims"/&gt;&lt;ref name="renner award"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ire.org/contest/past/1995.html |title=Past IRE Awards, 1995 |accessdate= |work=Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208120456/http://www.ire.org/contest/past/1995.html |archivedate=2007-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of credit given to Idema prompted Scurka and Caraballo to begin making a documentary film with the working title, ''Any Lesser Man: The Keith Idema Story''. According to promotional materials, the documentary was to be "the real story of one lone Green Beret's private war against KGB Nuclear Smuggling, Soviet spies, Arab terrorists, and the FBI." It was never completed.&lt;ref name="Operation Desert Fraud"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mooreclaims"/&gt;

===Marecek murder trial===
Idema and Scurka again worked together as consultants for the ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]'' story about [[Colonel George Marecek]], a highly decorated Special Forces soldier accused and later convicted of murdering his wife. The two were fired from the project because they were determined to be taking an advocacy role for the defense. They opened a "Free Marecek" office in the town where the trial was taking place. In December 2000, ''48 Hours'' ran the story on Marecek which included material from Idema, and Scurka's research.&lt;ref name="mooreclaims" /&gt; Idema also took a leading part in the formation of Point Blank News (PBN) to support Marecek.&lt;ref name="Marecekcase"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/family/george_marecek/index.html |title=Officer's Privilege: The Col.

On the day following the attacks, Idema gave an interview as a "counterterrorism adviser" to KTTV, the Fox network affiliate in Los Angeles. During his broadcast news appearance, he said that the hijackers might have seized three Canadian jetliners, in addition to four American planes.&lt;ref name="mooreclaims"/&gt;

====Al Qaeda hoax training footage====
Idema sold tapes to many publishers that he claimed showed an Al Qaeda training camp in action. The tapes showed men in camouflaged tunics and ski masks storming buildings, practicing drive-by shootings, and attacking golf courses. CBS bought the right to broadcast the tapes before any other network, they were used in a ''60 Minutes II'' episode called, "Heart of Darkness" in mid January 2002.&lt;ref name="mooreclaims"/&gt; CBS presented Idema and the tapes he supplied as reliable.&lt;ref name="CBS-Heart of Darkness"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=Heart of Darkness |publisher=CBS Worldwide Inc. |date=2002-01-17 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/01/16/60II/main324592.shtml |accessdate=2006-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Idema made more money from the same tapes when he sold them to ''The Boston Globe'', MSNBC, ABC, NBC, the BBC, and others rights to rebroadcast the Al Qaeda training camp footage with still pictures.&lt;ref name="mooreclaims"/&gt;

The authenticity of the several hours of tape is disputed because the supposed tactics shown are not ones Al Qaeda operatives utilize. Moreover, men who were shown in the footage occasionally communicated in English and laughed, providing credence to the notion that the tapes were fake and entirely staged.&lt;ref name="mooreclaims"/&gt; Some major outlets, including [[NBC Nightly News]] and CNN declined to broadcast the tapes because of the credibility issue.

====Idema in September 2008 Al Qaeda video====
Al Qaeda itself appears to have used some of Idema's footage in their September 2008 video release. In a segment released by ABC, Idema appears "to threaten to kill an Afghan citizen during an interrogation." Al Qaeda claims to have "captured" the footage from Idema, but its provenance remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5841873&amp;page=1 |title=New Al Qaeda Tape Surfaces Despite US Efforts to Block It |work=ABC News |date=September 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State-sponsored terrorism====
Idema sought to show that he had inside knowledge of Al Qaeda's collaboration with state governments, although his statements would not be considered particularly insightful, correct or original. For instance, he has made suggestions that there was collaboration among North Korea, several Middle-Eastern countries and Al Qaeda, and that was ample evidence linking "Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia to Al Qaeda and to the attacks on September 11," and that in Afghanistan, the link between Iraq and Al Qaeda was "common knowledge." He also has said that Iraq under [[Saddam Hussein]] was a supporter of Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations "with money, with equipment, with technology, with [[weapons of mass destruction]]."&lt;ref name="mooreclaims"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonard Lopate show"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lopate |first=Leonard |authorlink= |title=Behind The Lines |publisher=Columbia Journalism Review |date=2003-03-06 |url=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/episodes/2003/03/06 |accessdate=2007-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035111/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/episodes/2003/03/06 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed to have firsthand knowledge of nuclear weapons being smuggled from Russia to Iraq, Iran, and North Korea.&lt;ref name="mooreclaims"/&gt;

====Idema in September 2009 Al Qaeda video====
An Al Qaeda video released in September 2009 appears to contain video clips of Idema torturing an Afghan by dunking his head in a bucket of water. This footage was used to make the case that the US is involved in torture in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090922/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_al_qaida_video;_ylt=Ag0vSVTzMO7ii3Gvz6K3H7NnhVID;_ylu=X3oDMTJrZXF0MWtwBGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMDkwOTIyL21sX2FsX3FhaWRhX3ZpZGVvBGNwb3MDNwRwb3MDNwRzZWMDeW5fdG9wX3N0b3JpZXMEc2xrA2FsLXFhaWRhcHJlZA |title=Al-Qaida predicts Obama's fall by Muslim nation |author1=Paul Schemm |author2=Hadeek Al-Shalchi |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
* ''Task Force Dagger: The Hunt for bin Laden'' ({{ISBN|0-375-50861-9}}), by ''[[The Green Berets (book)|The Green Berets]]'' author [[Robin Moore]], had sections devoted to Idema, referred to in the book as a special forces operative named "Jack" (he was also featured on the book's cover). Unknown to Moore, Idema had added a number of fictional episodes to the book that he would later use to support his claims. In the manuscript Idema also included appeals for donations to charities listed under his and his wife's address – charities that have since come under investigation. He managed to do this by altering the final manuscript without Moore's consent before it was sent to the publisher. [[Random House]] quietly dropped the book from print after publishing what had become a work of fiction that even its author had disavowed.&lt;ref name=pownetwork/&gt; Moore has since regretted Idema's involvement and insisted that the publisher refused to include his corrections.&lt;ref name="mooreclaims"/&gt;
*[[Robert Young Pelton]], in his book about [[private military company|private security contractors]], ''Licensed to Kill: Hired Guns in the War on Terror'' ({{ISBN|1-4000-9781-9}}), devotes a chapter to Idema's exploits in Afghanistan, including his controversial involvement in Moore's book ''Task Force Dagger: The Hunt for bin Laden''.

'''Kehar Singh''', an assistant in the  Directorate General of Supply and Disposal, New  Delhi,  was tried and executed for conspiracy in the plot of the [[Indira Gandhi assassination]], carried out by [[Satwant Singh]] and [[Beant Singh (assassin)|Beant Singh]]. He was hanged in [[Tihar Jail]] on 6 January 1989. [[Beant Singh (assassin)|Beant Singh]] was the nephew of Kehar Singh.&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19850211&amp;id=L8UUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=i-EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6864,2583058 | title=India formally charges four Sikhs in slaying of Gandhi | newspaper=The Register-Guard | location=Eugene, Oregon | date=12 February 1985 | author=Associated Press | page=10A | accessdate=29 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The assassination was "motivated" by [[Operation Blue Star]], in which Indian Armed Forces personnel engaged an assault on the Golden Temple Complex at Amritsar. It was carried out starting on 3 June 1984. This was a military operation to control the Sikh armed rebellion in Punjab.

==Military action against separatists hiding in the Golden Temple in Amritsar==
[[Operation Blue Star]] was launched by the [[Indian Army]], to eliminate Jarnail Singh [[Bhindranwale]] and his followers who had been forced to seek cover in the Amritsar Golden Temple Complex by operations of the Indian government. The operation was launched in response to a so-called 'deterioration of law and order in the [[State of Punjab]]'. The roots of Operation Blue Star can be traced from the so-called '[[Khalistan Movement]]'. The Khalistan Movement is a political creation of the Indian National Congress Party and labeled as the 'Sikh anti-nationalist movement', that sought to create an "independent state" for Sikh people, inside the geographic region corresponding to the north-western plains of the [[Republic of India]]. The targets of the government were within the Harminder Sahib were led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and former Maj. Gen.[[Shabeg Singh]]. Maj. Gen. [[Kuldip Singh Brar]] had command of the action, operating under General [[Krishnaswamy Sundarji]], of the Indian army.

The Golden Temple compound and some of the surrounding houses were fortified. ''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]'' reported on 4 July that light machine-guns and semi-automatic rifles were known to have been brought into the compound by the militants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kuldip Nayar]] and [[Khushwant Singh]], ''Tragedy of Punjab: Operation Bluestar &amp; After'', Vision Books, New Delhi, 1984, page 79&lt;/ref&gt; 
Faced with imminent army action and with the foremost Sikh political organisation, [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] (headed by [[Harchand Singh Longowal]]), abandoning him, [[Bhindranwale]] declared [that], "This bird is alone. There are many hunters after it".&lt;ref&gt;''Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale - Life, Mission, and Martydrom'' by Ranbir S. Sandhu, May 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time magazine|''TIME'']] reported (about Amritsar) that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949867,00.html Time, 7 November 1983.]&lt;/ref&gt;

"These days it more closely resembles a city of death. Inside the temple compound, violent Sikh fanatics wield submachine guns, resisting arrest by government security forces. Outside, the security men keep a nervous vigil, all too aware that the bodies of murdered comrades often turn up in the warren of tiny streets around the shrine."

Despite these violent events blessed by the Indian government and blamed on Bhindranwale, the desecration of the holy shrine of the Golden Temple and Harminder Sahib caused outrage within the Sikh community against the Indian State. Sympathizers of Bhindranwale claimed that the attacks were "pre-planned" and that the anti-Sikh violence which followed was government orchestrated.{{Citation needed|reason=A reference would add more credence to the point being made in this statement|date=January 2018}}
 
Beant Singh was killed by gunfire at the scene of the assassination of Indira Gandhi. [[Satwant Singh]] was arrested and Kehar Singh was later arrested for conspiracy in the assassination.&lt;ref name="news.google.com"/&gt; Both were sentenced to death and hanged in [[Tihar Prisons|Tihar jail]] in Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rakesh Bhatnagar |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_the-accused-did-not-want-to-be-defended_1304802 |title=The accused did not want to be defended &amp;#124; Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy evidence==
The  evidence of [[Bimal Kaur Khalsa|Bimla Khalsa]], wife of Beant Singh indicates  that on 17 October 1984, Beant Singh  and  Kehar Singh  were combined and conspiring together. Satwant Singh later joining them for meals lends credence to this conclusion. She had revealed what she was told and what she had witnessed on 17 October 1984, in her own house.
 
In the first week of September 1984, when a [[falcon]] (baaz) happened to sit on a tree near the main reception of PM's house, at about 1.30 P.M. Balbir Singh spotted the falcon, and called Beant Singh there and pointed out to the falcon. Both of them agreed that it had brought the message of the Tenth Guru of the Sikhs and that they should do something by way of revenge of the 'Bluestar Operation'. Both of the above accused performed ardas then and there. The visit of Kehar Singh and Beant Singh along with their family members to Amritsar on 20 October. 1984 assumes importance and it is significant, to show how the appearance of the falcon motivated them. Since the 'Bluestar Operation', Balbir Singh was planning to commit the murder of Smt. Indira Gandhi and discussed his plans with Beant Singh, who had similar plans to commit the offence. Balbir Singh also shared his intention and prompted Satwant Singh to commit the murder of Smt. Indira Gandhi and finally discussed this matter	with him on 30 October 1984. However, Balbir Singh was acquitted on appeal to the Supreme Court in August. The main conspiracy, which was that of making [[Khalistan]], as alleged by the officially commissioned report on the killing, raises questions about the prosecution's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to the New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/06/world/india-hangs-two-sikhs-convicted-in-assassination-of-indira-gandhi.html |title=India Hangs Two Sikhs Convicted In Assassination of Indira Gandhi |location=INDIA |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1989-01-06 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals and judgments==
A special mention here is to the  650-page, written judgment in this 1984 assassination of Indira Gandhi, in which the Delhi High Court panel said, "No excuse or circumstance can . . . mitigate such a treacherous and cowardly act where a defenseless woman was cruelly slaughtered by the 'guardians' of her safety."

The judgment condemned "the most inhuman mode of killing" and said, "Two persons crowding in before an elderly woman and mercilessly pumping into her not one or two but as many as 30 bullets is the ghastly scene to be conjured in the mind's eye."

Similarly in the [[Supreme Court of India]] judgement, "In the instant case, the crime charged was not simply the  murdering of the human being, but it was the  crime  of assassination  of  the duly elected Prime  Minister  of  the country. The motive for the crime was not personal, but the consequences  of the action taken by the Government  in the exercise  of  constitutional  powers  and  duties.  In a democratic republic, no person who is duly constituted shall be  eliminated by privy conspiracies. The  'Operation Blue Star' was not directed to cause damage to Akal Takht. Nor it was  intended to hurt the religious feelings of Sikhs. The decision was  taken  by  the  responsible  and responsive Government in the national interest. The late Prime Minister Smt.  Indira  Gandhi was, however, made the target  for  the consequences  of the decision. The security guards who were duty-bound to protect the Prime Minister at the cost of their lives, themselves became the assassins. All values and all ideals in life; all norms and obligations were thrown to the winds. It was a betrayal of the worst order. It was the most foul and senseless assassination. The preparations for and  the  execution of this egregious crime deserved the dread sentence of the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/667073/ |title=Kehar Singh &amp; Ors vs State (Delhi Admn.) on 3 August, 1988 |publisher=Indiankanoon.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ram Jethmalani]]'s last futile battle to save Kehar Singh was fought in the Supreme Court. The apex court that heard two petitions during the working hours and a hurried last minute plea found no merit. "I am arguing under the shadow of two hangmen", pleaded Jethmalani. For two hours, Jethmalani and Shanti Bhushan tried to impress that the President had not applied his mind on the mercy petition. Their plea was that the evidence on which he was to be hanged was circumstantial. The five judge bench headed by the Chief Justice refused to intervene. These were the last words of Jethmalani: "If this court can't intervene then it is not just my client who will hang tomorrow. Something much more vital will die. It will not be Kehar Singh who will be hanged; it will be decency and justice". [[Shanti Bhushan]], who is father of [[Prashant Bhushan]], said, "In fact, the court must decide whether a man should ever be sentenced to death on the basis of circumstantial evidence alone. Circumstantial evidence can never remove that last lingering speck of doubt about a man's guilt."

In the adjoining court, R. S. Sodhi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/home/r-s-sodhi-a-man-of-justice_343196.html |title=R S Sodhi: A man of justice &amp;#124; Zee News |publisher=Zeenews.india.com |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; counsel for [[Satwant Singh]], argued that with his hanging, a vital piece of evidence would be lost for ever. Two Indo-Tibet Border Police commandos had opened fire killing [[Beant Singh (assassin)|Beant Singh]] on the spot and injuring Satwant Singh immediately after the attack on [[Indira Gandhi]]. He only wanted the execution to be stayed till his evidence against the commandos was recorded. The court refused to grant relief. It was around 4.00 pm that a lawyer ran into the court of the Chief Justice, huffing and panting. He wanted to file petition on behalf of Satwant's parents to prove that the entire case stood vitiated. The petition was dismissed within a minute after the lawyer stopped arguing.

At another level, the [[International Commission of Jurists]] pleaded with [[R. Venkataraman]], to grant clemency to Kehar Singh. Commission Secretary General [[Niall MacDermot]], [[British Labour Party]] politician, said he was profoundly disturbed by the rejection of pleas for mercy. Following is the text of the appeal:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
The [[International Commission of Jurists]] is profoundly disturbed by the rejection of pleas for mercy which have caused deep concern among the jurists throughout the world. As appears from the judgment, the only substantial evidence on which his conviction was based was that he had talks with Beant Singh on various occasions but there was no evidence as to the contents of those talks. We beseech you to exercise your right and power to have regard to the merits of the case in order to prevent what might be a terrible error of justice.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in obscure Mustafabad, the native village of Kehar Singh about 10&amp;nbsp;km from Bassi Pathana on the Chandigarh-Sirhind road, his relatives were calm on the day of hanging. The relatives had heard the news broadcast by Radio Pakistan in the 9.00 AM bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, Chand (1984). Bhindranwale: Myth and Reality. Vikas. p. 161. {{ISBN|0706926943}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kehar Singh, was convicted and hanged to death on a wet and chilly morning of 6 January 1989, for conspiracy in the plot of the [[Indira Gandhi assassination]], carried out by [[Satwant Singh]] and [[Beant Singh (assassin)|Beant Singh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=3 December 1986 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-03/news/mn-559_1_sikh-terrorism |title=Death Upheld for 3 Gandhi Assassins : Judges' Ruling Comes Day After Violent Sikh-Hindu Fighting - latimes |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1986-12-03 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh last words were, "Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akal", and they were allegedly in high spirits. Their ashes were not handed over to their families. The structures erected for their cremation in the Tihar jail were also demolished immediately.

==Operation Black Thunder==
Operation Blue Star had two components to it. The first one was Operation Metal, which was confined to the Harmandir Sahib (the Golden Temple) complex. Operation Metal was followed by Operation Shop. It raided the Punjab countryside, in order to capture any suspects.
India saw a repeat of Operation Blue Star a few years later. [[Operation Black Thunder]] was the name given to two operations that took place in India in the late 1980s, to flush out remaining Sikh activists from the Golden Temple. 'Black Cat' commandos of the National Security Guards were used in this operation. Similar to Operation Blue Star, these attacks were towards Khalistani militants who were using the Golden Temple in as a base. The first Operation Black Thunder took place on 30 April 1986. The second Operation Black Thunder began on 9 May 1988. The operation was headed by [[Kanwar Pal Singh Gill]], who was the DGP of [[Punjab Police (India)|Punjab Police]].

==Sikh militancy in Punjab==
In 2003, a [[Bhog]] ceremony was held at [[Akal Takhat]], Amritsar where tributes were paid to late Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi's assassins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030107/punjab1.htm#19 |title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Punjab |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date=2003-01-07 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, his death anniversary was again observed at [[Akal Takhat]], Amritsar, where [[SGPC]], [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] and head priest of Akal Takhat paid tributes to Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh.&lt;ref name="tribuneindia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040107/punjab1.htm#3 |title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Punjab |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, on 6 January 2008, the highest Sikh temporal seat ([[Akal Takhat]], [[Amritsar]]) declared Kehar Singh and other assassins of former prime minister, Indira Gandhi; as martyrs of Sikhism.&lt;ref name="tribuneindia.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=9640ce68-87e7-4f31-8106-e2d3752e35ac]{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/01/07/stories/2008010762501200.htm |title=Archive News |publisher=The Hindu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/indira-assassin-great-martyr-vedanti/258427/ |title=Indira assassin ‘great martyr’: Vedanti |publisher=Indian Express |date=2008-01-06 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SGPC]] also paid homage to both Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh and called them "martyrs of Sikh nation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abisz.genios.de/r_sppresse/daten/presse_tmid/20080107/tmid.1409006301.html]{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] observed their death anniversary as 'martyrdom' on 31 October 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20081101/bathinda.htm#3 |title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Bathinda Edition |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the British Sikh community has warned political parties going into general elections in May this year that failure to initiate an independent public inquiry into whether the Margaret Thatcher-led British government provided military assistance to India in planning Operation Blue star 30 years ago, will cost them the all-important Asian vote.

The Sikh Federation (UK) said on Thursday that it will be releasing the Sikh Manifesto 2015-2020 and naming a prioritised list of 50 target seats where the 700,000 strong Sikh community can determine who is elected in May 2015.

The Federation is also sending letters to the leaders of each of the main political parties to clarify their positions by 31 March, with regards to demands set out "in the Sikh Manifesto so the British Sikh community can be advised on the merits of each of the political parties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Share on Twitter |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/British-Sikhs-demand-inquiry-into-Thatcher-govts-role-in-1984-Operation-Bluestar/articleshow/45720555.cms |title=British Sikhs demand inquiry into Thatcher govt's role in 1984 Operation Bluestar - Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2015-01-01 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kurdistan Regional Government''' ('''KRG''') ({{lang-ku|حکوومەتی هەرێمی کوردستان}}, ''Hikûmetî Herêmî Kurdistan)'' is the official ruling body of the legal system in Kurdistan of Iraq commonly referred to as [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] or Southern and Basur Kurdistan part of the [[Kurdistan|greater Kurdistan]] country.

The cabinet is selected by the majority party or list who also selects the prime minister of the Iraqi Kurdistan region. The [[President of Iraqi Kurdistan|president]] is directly elected by the electorate of the region and is the head of the cabinet and chief of state who delegates executive powers to the cabinet. The [[Prime Minister of Iraqi Kurdistan|prime minister]] is traditionally the head of the legislative body but also shares executive powers with the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krg.org/articles/kurdistan_regional_government_en.html|title=Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)|website=www.krg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president of Iraqi Kurdistan is also the commander-in-chief of the [[Peshmerga|Peshmerga Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="nefel.com"&gt;[http://www.nefel.com/articles/article_detail.asp?RubricNr=1&amp;ArticleNr=1506 Constitution of the Kurdistan Region]&lt;/ref&gt; which is the army of the Kurdish controlled areas in Iraq. On the other hand, the Parliament creates and passes laws by a traditional majority vote, which therefore the president has the power to veto any bill. 

==Election process==
Since 1992, the governing bodies have been primarily based in [[Erbil]] ({{lang-ku|Hewlêr}}, هەولێر), officially declared as the capital of the region. The KRG (abbreviation for Kurdistan regional government) parliament, or the [[Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament|Kurdistan Parliament]] is elected by popular votes. Voters are given one vote and may choose a single party from the list. The cabinet is selected by the majority party or parties. The majority party or coalition appoints and negotiates terms for the prime minister of the Kurdistan region. Ultimately the president of the Kurdistan region is directly elected by its citizens.&lt;ref name="nefel.com" /&gt;

==Recent elections==

===1992 elections===
On 19 May 1992, 6 months after [[Kurds]] had gained their freedom, the first elections were held. Due to the 7% threshold the only parties which had a chance of winning seats in parliament were the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party|KDP]] and the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]] political party. The election resulted in a narrow victory for the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|KDP]], which with 45% of the vote gained 51 seats while the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]] with 44% of the vote gained 49 seats. However, due to allegations of election fraud they divided the seats 50–50 and created a unity government. The government however collapsed and resulted in a [[Kurdish Civil War|civil war]] breaking out in 1994. The last parliamentary meeting was held in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knn.u-net.com/parlim~1.htm |title=Parl |publisher=Knn.u-net.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215225953/http://www.knn.u-net.com/parlim~1.htm |archivedate=2012-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It resulted in the creation of two Kurdish states, a [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]]-controlled state based in [[Silemani]] and a [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|KDP]]-controlled state based in [[Hewler]], both proclaiming themselves as legitimate rulers of Kurdistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee |first=Andrew |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1174457,00.html |title=Trouble in Kurdistan |publisher=TIME |date=2006-03-17 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 elections===
{{further|Iraqi Kurdistan Governorate elections 2005}}

The primary goal of the 2005 elections was to end party-rule in the [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] and unify the two major parties—the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|Kurdistan Democratic Party]] (KDP) and the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] (PUK)—who fought a civil war in the mid-1990s over territorial disputes and control of the [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdistan Region]]. Previously, the region was divided up by administrative provinces that were under control of either the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|KDP]] or the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]]. In 2004, the two parties created one unified list or coalition called the [[Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan]], which included several smaller parties as well. Not surprisingly, the coalition received the majority of votes (an overwhelming 90%) allowing the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|KDP]] and [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]] to effectively divide key positions in government. The coalition achieved 104 of the 111 seats in parliament.&lt;ref name="reliefweb.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/LSGZ-6VRD5U?OpenDocument |title=Iraq: Sulaymaniyah Governorate assessment report |publisher=Reliefweb.int |date=2006-08-31 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the IKP held its first official meeting with [[Massoud Barzani]] as the elected president. After six long months, the IKP finally agreed on administration positions. In 2006, the government was selected with [[Nechervan Idris Barzani]] as prime minister.&lt;ref name="reliefweb.int"/&gt; The parties also negotiated terms for the prime minister. [[Nechervan Barzani]], who is a member of the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|KDP]], was expected to serve two years and would be replaced with a [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]] candidate in 2008.

[[Iraqi governorate elections, 2005|Governorate elections]] were held in [[Iraq]], in 2005, including in the three [[Kurdish People|Kurdish]] provinces. The elections resulted in a [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|KDP]] victory in [[Hewler]] and [[Duhok, Iraq|Duhok]] with [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]] a victory in [[Silemani]]. In total the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]] won the most votes during in these 3 provinces together with a total of 765,544 votes (43.4%) however they won only 48 seats while the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|KDP]] with 741,483 votes (42%) won 62 seats. Other parties won only 4 seats in Kurdish provinces. [[Kurdish People|Kurdish]] parties also won majorities in Ninawa and Kirkuk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/html/newsletterImages/PF81Annexes.pdf |title=Provincial Politics in Iraq |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 elections===
[[File:Iraqi Kurdistan legislative election, 2009 results pie chart.png|thumb|right|250px|25 July 2009 election results]]
{{further|Iraqi Kurdistan parliamentary election, 2009}}
The latest parliamentary elections were held on 25 July 2009. [[Kurdistan List]], a joint list of [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|KDP]] and [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]], won the largest share of seats and was tasked to form the next government. Major opposition parties include [[Movement for Change|Change List]] and Reform List with 25 and 13 seats respectively. The new prime minister, [[Barham Salih]] of [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]], assumed office on 28 October 2009. Minority Turkmen have five seats and Christians (Assyrians and Armenians) are represented with four seats. This KRG government comprised 19 ministries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krg.org/articles/detail.asp?anr=32349&amp;lngnr=12&amp;rnr=93&amp;smap=04020000 |title=Kurdistan Regional Government |publisher=KRG |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Massoud Barzani]] was elected as [[President of Iraqi Kurdistan]] by the parliament. In 2009, the KRG decided that the president would no longer be selected by parliament, and instead, direct elections would take place. In the 2009 elections, [[Massoud Barzani|President Barzani]] ran for re-election and faced a host of opposing candidates including Halow Ibrahim Ahmed, Kamal Mirawdily, Ahmed Mohammed Rasul and Hussein Garmiyani. The election was a landslide victory for [[Massoud Barzani|Barzani]] getting approximately 70% of the votes. Kemal Mirawdily came second with 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hFDxqcV5_5pBvNq_kHWZdFLr6EMw |title=AFP: Opposition set to break Iraqi Kurd stranglehold |publisher=Google.com |date=2009-07-26 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 elections===
The Kurdish elections were held on 21 September 2013. The former president of Kurdistan Masoud Barzani ran once more for the presidential list. 
{{further|Iraqi Kurdistan parliamentary election, 2013}}

==Role in Iraq==
The KRG has assumed governmental responsibility in the federal region of [[Iraq]]. As stipulated by the [[Iraqi constitution]], Iraq will be divided into federal regions that will handle their own domestic affairs while the [[Baghdad]] central government will deal with international affairs. The single most controversial issue regarding federalism is oil. The KRG under [[Nechervan Barzani]] has signed several oil contracts with foreign states, including companies in the United States and China.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSGEE5AL08420091122?rpc=401&amp; |title=Sinopec bid to take part in Iraq oil deals rebuffed |publisher=Reuters.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bloomberg L.P.]] if it were a country KRG would rank 10th amongst countries with largest reserves.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-11-14/2014-outlook-kurdistans-oil-ambitions |title=Kurdistan's Oil Ambitions
 |publisher=www.businessweek.com |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the KRG asserts that such contracts are legal under Iraqi law and the constitution, many disputes remain as to whether these contracts are legitimate. 

The main Kurdish parties and [[Peshmerga]] cooperated with the US-led coalition during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] that led to [[Saddam Hussein]]'s overthrow. After the Ba'ath government failed, [[Kurdish People|Kurdish]] politicians were finally represented in the [[Iraqi governing council]]. On January 30, 2005 three elections were held in the region: 1) for Transitional National Assembly of Iraq 2) for Iraqi Kurdistan National Assembly and 3) for provincial councils.&lt;ref&gt;H. Walker, T. Clark, ''Election in Iraq - 30 January 2005:An Assessment'', Journal of Asian Affairs, Vol.36, No.2, July 2005, p.182&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period]] recognized the autonomy of the Kurdistan Regional Government during the interim between "full sovereignty" and the [[Iraqi constitution ratification vote, 2005|adoption]] of a [[Constitution of Iraq|permanent constitution]].

The Kurdistan Regional Government currently has legal constitutional authority over the provinces of [[Arbil Governorate|Erbil]], [[Dohuk Governorate|Duhok]], [[Sulaymaniyah|Slemani]], and [[Halabja Governorate|Halabja]]. Including the "de facto" authority over parts of [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala]] and [[Ninawa Governorate|Ninawa]] provinces. Following the 2017 Kurdish Referendum for Independence certain miltias such as the [[Popular Mobilization Forces|Popular mobilisation forces]] of Iraq which are openly armed by [[Iran|the Islamic republic of Iran]] launched attacks that led to the [[Kirkuk status referendum|Kirkuk October]] incident. The end result was that Kurdistan lost control over the city of Kirkuk and smaller areas surrounding the oil rich city i.e [[Makhmur, Iraq|Makhmour]]. Many people argue that some political factions in Kurdistan such as the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan specifically [[Bafel Talabani|Bavel Talabani]] of the Talabani tribe betrayed the Kurdish people and other parties as PUK gave the green light for the central government of Baghdad to attack Peshmerga forces that were initially in Kirkuk. 

One particularly difficult issue yet to be resolved is the future boundaries of the region. Many [[Kurds]] wish it to be expanded to include the [[Kurdish People|Kurdish]] majority city of [[Kirkuk]], but this is complicated as the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] and [[Arab]] populations of the city and the opposition of [[Turkey]], which is concerned about the region's potential to break away from [[Iraq]] (with possible consequences for [[Turkish Kurdistan|its own Kurdish minority]]). The final boundaries of the autonomous region are set to be decided through a number of referendums which were scheduled to be held before the end of 2007 as stipulated in the Iraqi constitution. The purpose of these referendums are to analyse whether the Arabisation policies launched by the old Iraqi government still exist and to act accordingly. However, the preparations needed for such a referendum to take place have not been made by the Iraqi central government, and the promised referendums have been postponed for up to six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/06/0b7c4568-f124-4224-98ba-f498102d52aa.html |title=Iraq: Kurdish Official Says Kirkuk Normalization To Proceed - RADIO FREE EUROPE / RADIO LIBERTY |publisher=Rferl.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the [[Iraqi constitution ratification vote, 2005|ratification]] of the [[constitution of Iraq|Iraqi constitution]] in October 2005, [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] reconstituted itself as a federal region under the new constitutional framework. [[At-Ta'mim Governorate|Kirkuk]]'s status with respect to the federal region should, under that framework, be decided by a simple majority vote in the provinces.

The Kurdistan Regional Government has inaugurated a movement to distinguish itself from the rest of [[Iraq]], entitled "Kurdistan – [[The Other Iraq]]", in a bid to attract investors by showing its security and economic progress amidst the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theotheriraq.com/ |title=Kurdistan |publisher=The Other Iraq |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] region, has in 2005, established a sister-state relationship with the US State of [[Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.or.us/05orlaws/sessresmem.dir/scr0003ses.htm|title=Senate Concurrent Resolution 3, Oregon Laws 2005|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611110639/http://www.leg.state.or.us/05orlaws/sessresmem.dir/scr0003ses.htm|archivedate=2011-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November 2012, combat between Baghdad and Kurdish-[[Irbil]] military units broke out into open clashes and required an urgent security agreement between federal and Kurdish military officials to avert further fighting.&lt;ref name=Kurd-Shiite-Sunni-Split&gt;{{cite web|last=Salem|first=Paul|title=INSIGHT: Iraq’s Tensions Heightened by Syria Conflict|url=http://middleeastvoices.voanews.com/2012/11/insight-iraqs-tensions-heightened-by-syria-conflict-96791/|publisher=Middle East Voices -VOA|accessdate=3 November 2012|date=November 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From mid-2013 to mid-2014, the KRG "built up their own defenses by creating a security belt stretching more than 1,000 km (600 miles) from the Iranian border all the way to Syria – skirting around Mosul, a city of 2 million people, they appear to have no intention of fighting for the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]]."&lt;ref name="Kurds realize dream"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/13/us-iraq-security-kurds-idUSKBN0EO2MJ20140613 | title=Kurds realize dream as Baghdad loses grip on north Iraq | publisher=Reuters | date=13 June 2014 | accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, [[Northern Iraq offensive (August 2014)|ISIS attacked the Kurds]].

On 13 June 2014, the city of [[Kirkuk]] and the surrounding area was seized, without firing a shot,&lt;ref name="Kurds realize dream" /&gt; by the [[Peshmerga]] and added to Iraqi Kurdistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27838034|title=Struggle for Iraq: In maps |publisher=BBC|date=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2014, [[Massud Barzani]] announced that "Iraq's Kurds will hold an independence referendum within months."&lt;ref name="Kurdish Leader: We Will Vote For Independence Soon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/kurdish-leader-vote-for-independence-soon-2014-7?nr_email_referer=1 | title=Kurdish Leader: We Will Vote For Independence Soon | publisher=Business Insider | date=1 July 2014 | accessdate=1 July 2014 | author=Agence France Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Turkey has traditionally been strongly opposed to the notion of a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] state, there are now indications that modern Turkey is ready to recognize an independent [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] state outside of Turkey. Hüseyin Çelik, Deputy Chairman of ruling AK-party, is quoted to have said "If Iraq is divided and it is inevitable, (the Kurdish Regional Government) are our brothers. Unfortunately, the situation in Iraq is not good and it looks like it is going to be divided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/national_celik-signals-turkey-to-welcome-independent-kurdish-state-in-iraq_351625.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305023211/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_celik-signals-turkey-to-welcome-independent-kurdish-state-in-iraq_351625.html |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/130620142|title=Turkey's AKP Spokesman: Iraq's Kurds Have Right to Decide Their Future|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/turkey-may-support-independent-kurdistan-2014-7?IR=T|title=The Tide Is Finally Turning For The Kurds — Especially In Turkey|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/07/idiz-kurds-independence-ankara-krg-isis-mosul-iraq-kirkuk.html#|title=Would Turkey accept a Kurdish state?|date=1 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017 ===
In September, a referendum was held regarding Kurdish independence in Iraq. 92% of Iraqi Kurds voted in favor of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20170927-iraqi-kurds-vote-overwhelmingly-independence-referendum|title=92% of Iraqi Kurds back independence from Baghdad, election commission says - France 24|date=2017-09-27|work=France 24|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/27/over-92-of-iraqs-kurds-vote-for-independence|title=More than 92% of voters in Iraqi Kurdistan back independence|last=Chulov|first=Martin|date=2017-09-27|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum was regarded as illegal by the federal government in [[Baghdad]], and on 6 November, Iraq's Supreme Federal Court ruled that no Iraqi province was allowed to secede in order to preserve the unity of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds/iraqcourt-rules-no-region-can-secede-after-kurdish-independence-bid-idUSKBN1D617O|title=Iraq court rules no region can secede after Kurdish independence bid|date=2017-11-06|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November, the KRG announced it would respect the Supreme Federal Court's ruling, stating that "this decision must become a basis for starting an inclusive national dialogue between (Kurdish authorities in) [[Erbil]] and Baghdad to resolve all disputes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds/iraqs-kurdistan-says-to-respect-court-decision-banning-secession-idUSKBN1DE0XD|title=Iraq's Kurdistan says to respect court decision banning secession|date=2017-11-14|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Landless People's Movement - Johannesburg, 14 May 2009.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Landless People's Movement outside the Constitutional Court, 14 May 2009]]

'''The Landless People's Movement''' is an independent [[social movement]] in [[South Africa]]. It consists of rural people and people living in shack settlements in cities.&lt;ref name= "Silencing" /&gt; The Landless People's Movement boycotts parliamentary elections&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarkismo.net/article/12628 The Jacob Zuma Cargo Cult and the “Implosion” of Alliance Politics], by Michael Schmidt, ''Anarkismo'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and has a history of conflict with the [[African National Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=133565 The seed of a new opposition?]''Business Day'', 7 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Landless People's Movement is affiliated to [[Via Campesina]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/feb/10/world-social-forum-senegal World Social Forum – Thursday 10 February], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; internationally and its [[Johannesburg]] branches to [[the Poor People's Alliance]] in South Africa.

==History==
On 24 July 2001 provincial representatives of local landless formations met with regional organisations to unite their grievances and collectively seek change to relieve their struggles. The Landless People's Movement was formed out of this meeting&lt;ref name= "Habib"&gt;{{cite book |title= Voices of Protest Social Movements in Post-apartheid South Africa|last= Habib|first= Adam|authorlink= |author2=Imraan Valodia |year= 2006|publisher= University of Kwazulu Natal|location= New York City|isbn= 1-86914-089-3|page= 133|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its stated aims were to:
:{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|
* To strengthen the capacity of the rural landless to organise effectively and advocate for themselves
* To speed up [[land reform]] and hold the government to account on their promises
* To draw on a wider South/South network to support initiatives of landless people in South Africa
* To develop public awareness nationally and internationally about the needs of rural landless communities in South Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waronwant.org/overseas-work/food-justice/landless-in-south-africa |title=The Landless of South Africa |publisher=[[War on Want]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
|}
The movement was initially formed and support by an NGO, the National Land Committee (NLC), but in 2003 it broke with the NLC and has since operated autonomously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landaction.org/display.php?article=91 |title=Crisis in South Africa Land Reform Movement |publisher= Land Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2003 the movement issued a Memorandum to then President [[Thabo Mbeki]] asking "why is development brought to us through guns and the terror" and demanding an immediate halt to all evictions on farms and from urban squatter camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landaction.org/display.php?article=136 |title=Memorandum To President Thabo Mbeki |publisher= Land Action}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2008 the Protea South branch in [[Johannesburg]] won a landmark court order against the city of Johannesburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abahlali.org/taxonomy/term/885 |title=Landless Peoples' Movement Protea South |publisher=[[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Landless People's Movement has been successful in linking the commonalities between both rural and urban land dispossession.&lt;ref name= "Silencing"&gt;{{cite book |title= Silencing Human Rights|editor1-last= Bhambra|editor1-first= Gurminder |editor2= Robbie Shilliam|year= 2009|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|location= New York City|isbn= 0-230-22276-5|pages= 230–232|oclc=784531812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007 the Freedom of Expression Institute reported that at a peaceful protest by the Landless People's Movement:

"SAPS members fired at random towards the protesters, leaving the pavement covered with the blue casings of rubber bullets. Police also deployed a helicopter and water cannon, and we saw at least two officers using live ammunition. One Protea South resident, Mandisa Msewu, was shot in the mouth by a rubber bullet, and several other residents were attended to by paramedics due to police violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abahlali.org/node/2183|title=

In February 2009 the movement reported that eight Landless People's Movement activists from Protea South were arrested following a peaceful protest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abahlali.org/node/4865 8 Landless People's Movement Comrades Under Arrest in Johannesburg]&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement claims to have been subject to severe repression in Johannesburg in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sabarometerblog.wordpress.com/archive/volume-eight-2010/political-tolerance-on-the-wane-in-south-africa/ Political tolerance on the wane in South Africa], Imraan Buccus, ''SA Reconciliation Barometer'', September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; including arrest, arson and murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.habitants.org/news/inhabitants_of_africa/south_africa_independent_report_into_political_violence_against_landless_people_s_movement Independent Report into Political Violence Against the Landless People's Movement], International Alliance of Inhabitants, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleofcolororganize.com/news/south-africa-landless-peoples-movement-activist-killed-police-johannesburg/ Landless People’s Movement Activist Killed by Police in Johannesburg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311083100/http://www.peopleofcolororganize.com/news/south-africa-landless-peoples-movement-activist-killed-police-johannesburg/ |date=11 March 2011 }}, People of Color Organize, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2010 one of the movement's activists, Terrance Mbuleo (33), was murdered by middle class vigilantes in [[Soweto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalism.cuny.edu/capstones/to-be-betrayed-by-your-brother/ To Be Betrayed By Your Brother], Rosaleen Ortiz, ''City University of New York'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poor People's Alliance==
In September 2008 the [[Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign]], together with [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]], the Johannesburg branches of the Landless People's Movement and the Rural Network (Abahlali basePlasini) in KwaZulu-Natal formed the [[Poor People's Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2009/01/12/18562116.php The Struggle for Land &amp; Housing in Post-Apartheid South Africa by Toussaint Losier, Left Turn, January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zcommunications.org/znet/viewArticle/21529 'Participatory Society: Urban Space &amp; Freedom', by Chris Spannos, Z-Net, 29 May 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606072510/http://www.zcommunications.org/znet/viewArticle/21529 |date=6 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The poor people's alliance refuses electoral politics under the banner '[[No Land! No House! No Vote!]]'.&lt;ref&gt;The alliance, and its position on electoral politics, is mentioned in the speech by S'bu Zikode at http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2008/12/415682.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Milice française''''' ([[France|French]] [[Militia]]), generally called the '''''Milice''''' ({{IPA-fr|milis}}), was a political [[paramilitary]] organization created on 30 January 1943 by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] (with [[Nazi Germany|German]] aid) to help fight against the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]]. The Milice's formal head was Prime Minister [[Pierre Laval]], although its Chief of operations and ''de facto'' leader was Secretary General [[Joseph Darnand]]. It participated in [[summary execution]]s and [[assassination]]s, helping to round up Jews and ''résistants'' in France for deportation. It was the successor to Joseph Darnand's ''[[Service d'ordre légionnaire]]'' (SOL) militia. The Milice was the Vichy regime's most extreme manifestation of fascism. Ultimately, Darnand envisaged the Milice as a fascist [[single party]] political movement for the French state.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Blinkhorn, 2003, Fascists and Conservatives: The Radical Right and the Establishment in Twentieth-Century Europe, p. 193, {{ISBN|1134997124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Milice frequently used [[torture]] to extract information or confessions from those whom they interrogated. The French Resistance considered the Milice more dangerous than the [[Gestapo]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] because they were native Frenchmen who understood local dialects fluently, had extensive knowledge of the towns and countryside, and knew local people and informants.

==Membership==

Early Milice volunteers included members of France's pre-war far-right parties (such as the [[Action Française]]) and [[working-class]] men convinced of the benefits of the Vichy government's politics. In addition to ideology, incentives for joining the Milice included employment, regular pay and rations. (The latter became particularly important as the war continued, and civilian rations dwindled to near-starvation levels.) Some joined because members of their families had been killed or injured in Allied bombing raids or had been threatened, extorted or attacked by [[French Resistance]] groups. Still others joined for more mundane reasons: petty criminals were recruited by being told their sentences would be commuted if they joined the organization, and Milice volunteers were exempt from transportation to Germany as forced labour.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Jankowski, "In Defense of Fiction: Resistance, Collaboration, and Lacombe, Lucien". The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 63, No. 3 (Sep., 1991), pp. 462&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated by several historians (including [[Julian T. Jackson]]) that the Milice's membership reached 25,000–30,000 by 1944, although official figures are difficult to obtain. The majority of members were not full-time militiamen, but devoted only a few hours per week to their Milice activities.&lt;ref name="feldman"&gt;Matthew Feldman, 2004, Fascism: The 'fascist epoch', p. 243, {{ISBN|0415290198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Milice had a section for full-time members, the [[Franc-Garde]], who were permanently mobilized and lived in barracks.&lt;ref name="feldman"/&gt;

The Milice also had youth sections for boys and girls, called the ''Avant-Garde''.&lt;ref name="feldman"/&gt;

===Emblem===

The chosen emblem for the Milice carried the [[Greek language|Greek]] letter '''γ''' ([[gamma]]), the symbol of the [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] [[astrological sign]] in the [[Zodiac]], ostensibly representing rejuvenation, and replenishment of energy.

Milice troops (known as ''miliciens'') wore a blue uniform jacket and trousers, brown shirt and a wide blue [[beret]]. (During active paramilitary-style operations, an [[Adrian helmet]] was used.) Its newspaper was ''Combats'' (not to be confused with the underground Resistance newspaper, ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''). It employed full-time and part-time personnel, and had a youth wing. The Milice's armed forces were officially known as the ''[[Franc-Garde]]''. Contemporary photographs show the Milice armed with a variety of weapons captured from Allied forces.

==History==

=== Beginnings ===
The Resistance targeted individual ''miliciens'' for assassination, often in public areas such as cafés and streets. On 24 April 1943 they shot and killed Paul de Gassovski, a ''milicien'' in [[Marseilles]]. By late November, ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'' reported that 25 ''miliciens'' had been killed and 27 wounded in Resistance attacks.

=== Reprisals ===
The most prominent person killed by the Resistance was [[Philippe Henriot]], the Vichy regime's Minister of Information and Propaganda, who was known as "the French [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]]". He was killed in his apartment in the [[Minister of Information (France)|Ministry of Information]] on the rue Solferino in the predawn hours of 28 June 1944 by ''résistants'' dressed as ''miliciens.'' His wife, who was in the same room, was spared. The Milice retaliated for this by killing several well-known [[anti-Nazi]] politicians and intellectuals (such as [[Victor Basch]]) and prewar conservative leader [[Georges Mandel]].

The Milice initially operated in the former ''[[Zone libre]]'' of France under the control of the Vichy regime.  In January 1944, the radicalized Milice moved into what had been the ''[[zone occupée]]'' of France (including Paris). They established their headquarters in the old Communist Party headquarters at 44 rue Le Peletier and at 61 rue Monceau. (The house was formerly owned by the [[Menier family]], makers of France's best-known chocolates.) The [[Lycée Louis-Le-Grand]] was occupied as a barracks, and an officer candidate school was established in the [[Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy|Auteuil]] synagogue.

=== Notable actions ===
[[Image:Brigade-speciale-IMG 0894.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Membership card with photo, stamp and tricolor diagonal lettering|Counterfeit Milices card prepared for French Resistance member Serge Ravanel, under the alias of Charles Guillemot]]

Perhaps the largest and best-known operation undertaken by the Milice was the [[Maquis des Glières|Battle of Glières]], its attempt in March 1944 to suppress the Resistance in the ''département'' of [[Haute-Savoie]] (in southeastern France, near the Swiss border).&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldatwar.net/article/glieres/index.html "Battle of Glieres"], World at War&lt;/ref&gt; The Milice could not overcome the Resistance, and had to call in German troops to complete the operation. On Bastille Day, 14 July 1944, ''miliciens'' suppressed a revolt among the prisoners at Paris' [[La Santé Prison|Santé prison]].

The legal standing of the Milice was never clarified by the Vichy government; it operated parallel to (but separate from) the Vichy French police force. The Milice operated outside civilian law, and its actions were not subject to judicial review or control.

=== End of the war ===
In August 1944, as the tide of war was shifting and fearing he would be held accountable for the operations of the Milice, Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] distanced himself from the organization by writing a harsh letter rebuking Darnand for the organization's excesses. Darnand's response suggested that Pétain ought to have voiced his objections sooner.

Historians have debated the strength of the organization, but it was probably between 25,000 and 35,000 (including part-time members and non-combatants) by the time of the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944. The membership began melting away rapidly thereafter. Following the [[Liberation of France]], members who failed to flee to Germany (where they were impressed into the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)|Charlemagne Division]] of the [[Waffen-SS]]) or elsewhere, generally faced imprisonment for treason, execution following courts-martial or murder by vengeful ''résistants'' and civilians. During a period of unofficial reprisals immediately following on the German retreat, large numbers of ''miliciens'' were executed, either individually or in groups. Milice offices throughout France were ransacked with agents often being brutally beaten and then thrown from office windows, or into rivers before being taken to prison. At [[Le Grand-Bornand]] 76 captured members of the Milice were executed by [[French Forces of the Interior]] on 24 August 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lefrancophoney.com/the-lost-cemetery-of-le-grand-bornand/|title=The lost cemetery of Le Grand-Bornand|date=23 August 2013|publisher=www.lefrancophoney.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aftermath ===
An unknown number of ''miliciens'' managed to escape prison or execution, either by going underground or fleeing abroad. A few were later prosecuted. The most notable of these was [[Paul Touvier]], the former commander of the Milice in [[Lyon]]. In 1994, he was convicted of ordering the retaliatory execution of seven Jews at [[Rillieux-la-Pape]]. He died in prison two years later.

==In popular culture==
*Since the war, the term ''milice'' has acquired a derogatory meaning in [[France]].
*The French hard rock ensemble [[Trust (French band)|Trust]] had a hit named "Police Milice", where its frontman [[Bernard Bonvoisin]] compared modern-day [[police officer]]s to the Milice. 
*[[Louis Malle]]'s films ''[[Lacombe, Lucien]]'' and ''[[Au revoir les enfants]]'' include the Milice as part of the plot.
*The 2003 drama ''[[The Statement (film)|The Statement]]'', directed by [[Norman Jewison]] and starring [[Michael Caine]], was adapted from the 1996 novel by the same name by [[Brian Moore (novelist)|Brian Moore]]. He shaped it from the story of [[Paul Touvier]], a Vichy French Milice official who hid for years (often sheltered by the Catholic Church) and was indicted in 1991 for [[war crimes]].
* The film ''[[Female Agents]]'' ({{lang-fr|Les Femmes de l'ombre}}), set during World War II, has a scene where two of the female agents walk past a recruitment poster for the Milice which says "Against Communism / French Militia / Secretary-General Joseph Darnand".
*In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' audio story ''[[Resistance (Doctor Who audio)|Resistance]]'', the [[Second Doctor|Doctor]] and [[Polly (Doctor Who)|Polly]] have to evade the Milice in 1944.
*They feature prominently in the popular French TV series ''[[Un village français|Un Village Français]]'' which covers the whole period of the occupation and liberation and was broadcast in France and extensively internationally.[http://www.allocine.fr/series/ficheserie-4117/saison-28948/]

'''Miranda Devine''' (born 1960s&lt;ref name = "born"/&gt;) is an Australian columnist and writer noted for her conservative stance on a range of social and political issues. Her [[column (newspaper)|column]], formerly printed twice weekly in [[Fairfax Media]] newspapers ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Sun-Herald]]'', now appears in the News Limited newspapers ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', Melbourne's ''[[Sunday Herald Sun]]'' and Perth's ''[[Sunday Times]]''. She hosted ''The Miranda Devine Show'', a weekly syndicated radio show on Sydney station [[2GB]]. The show ended in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mumbrella.com.au/miranda-devine-leaves-radio-2gb-341462|title=Miranda Devine pulls plug on Sunday night’s Radio 2GB ‘The Miranda Devine Show’|date=21 January 2016|accessdate=22 January 2016|publisher=Mumbrella|first=Nic|last=Christensen}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Life and career==
Devine is the daughter of journalist [[Frank Devine]]. She and her two younger sisters spent considerable parts of their youth overseas while their father was working as a foreign correspondent for Australian newspapers and, later, edited various American newspapers. While living in Tokyo, Devine attended an American [[International School]] and learned to speak Japanese fluently.&lt;ref name="BulletinBagnall"/&gt; A devout [[Roman Catholic]], she completed her high school education at [[Loreto Kirribilli]], a Catholic girls' private school in Sydney. After school, she completed a BSc in mathematics at [[Macquarie University]].&lt;ref&gt;The Australian, 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; She joined the [[CSIRO]] in their textile physics division, where she worked for four years.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}  She then completed a one-year graduate program at the Medill School of Journalism,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/msj/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northwestern University]] in Chicago.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} 

On 6 August 2010, ''The Daily Telegraph'' announced that Devine would be returning as a columnist for both ''The Daily Telegraph'' and ''Sunday Telegraph''.&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph"/&gt;

She describes herself as "a Catholic and a mother".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/too-many-enemies-are-basking-in-george-pells-situation/news-story/7cb21419b9031dfb9d16a53797329944 Too many enemies are basking in George Pell’s situation], ''Daily Telegraph'', 2 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views ==
=== White genocide ===
Devine has been accused by media of promoting the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]] and described as pivotal in popularising the concept within Australian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2018/mar/22/white-australians-debate-fast-track-visas-afrikane/ |title=White Australians debate fast-track visas for Afrikaners fleeing land reform |date=22 March 2018 |publisher=''[[New York Amsterdam News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2018-03-22-aussie-minister-dutton-the-next-prime-minister-or-the-great-divider |title=Aussie Minister Dutton the next prime minister, or the great divider? |date=22 March 2018 |publisher=''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite news |url=

== Commentary and controversy ==
Devine is a friend of fellow conservative columnist [[Tim Blair]], who said of her, "She's got good antennae. She can read people which is why she accurately predicts election results".&lt;ref name="BulletinBagnall"/&gt; When interviewed for an April 2007 article in ''[[The Australian]]'' about [[hate mail]] received by female columnists, Devine commented, "You are contesting ideas and you have to do it in a [[Polarization (politics)|polarising]] way. When you write a column, you can't sit on the fence".&lt;ref name="HateMail"/&gt;

In their book ''[[Silencing Dissent]]'' ([[Allen &amp; Unwin]]), [[Clive Hamilton]] and [[Sarah Maddison]] accuse Devine of belonging to a "syndicate of right-wing commentators who receive favour from the [[John Howard|Howard]] Government."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21144760-7583,00.html "How a right-wing, pro-Howard cabal is stifling debate"], an excerpt from ''[[Silencing Dissent]]'', printed in ''[[The Australian]]'' on 31 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Devine used the news of Australian federal government minister [[Penny Wong]]'s decision to parent a child with her female partner as the basis of a column in which she argued that the [[2011 England riots|2011 riots in England]] were the result of a "fatherless society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Devine |first=Miranda |title=The Problems of a Fatherless Society |url=http://blogs.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/mirandadevine/index.php/dailytelegraph/comments/its_a_myth_conception |accessdate=14 August 2011 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |date=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Deveny |first=Catherine |authorlink=Catherine Deveny |date=17 August 2011 |title=Why equal rights activists need Miranda Devine more than rallies |work=The Drum |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/2842140.html |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Devine sparked considerable controversy after claiming that "women abusing welfare" were the main cause of [[domestic violence]]. According to Devine, "If you want to break the cycle of violence, end the welfare incentive for unsuitable women to keep having children to a string of feckless men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jenny |last=Noyes |url=http://www.dailylife.com.au/dl-people/miranda-devine-column-prompts-domestic-violence-survivors-to-share-unsuitablewomen-stories-20150928-gjw8ua.html |title=Miranda Devine column prompts domestic violence survivors to share #UnsuitableWomen stories |newspaper=The Vine |date=28 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, she wrote that share bicycle schemes were a terror threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/city-share-bikes-are-a-terrorists-best-friend/news-story/e193af2dd3b08458e2a4ba8442a847e9 City share bikes are a terrorist’s best friend], [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]], 28 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Devine advocated for the continuation of [[Fossil fuel power station#Coal|coal-fired electricity]] options; she has repeatedly [[Climate change denial|suggested]] that [[climate change]] is a political conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/...a.../b7eda462757d6e9ed4e91c8e6541b98b Smart meters energy crisis not reducing bills or...], [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]], 7 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mon National Liberation Army''' ({{lang-my|မွန်အမျိုးသား လွတ်မြောက်ရေး တပ်မတော်}}; [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''MNLA''') is a [[Mon people|Mon]] [[Insurgency|insurgent group]] in [[Myanmar]] (Burma).&lt;ref name=MyMon&gt;[http://www.mmpeacemonitor.org/stakeholders/stakeholders-overview/164-nmsp Myanmar Peace Monitor: Stakeholders - New Mon State Party]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the armed wing of the [[New Mon State Party]] (NMSP), and has been fighting government forces since 1949, though under different names. The NMSP signed the [[Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement]] (NCA) on 15 October 2015 with several other insurgent groups and the government of Myanmar.

In September 2016, MNLA fighters began clashing with members of the [[Karen National Liberation Army]] (KNLA), the armed wing of the [[Karen National Union]] (KNU), in the [[Tanintharyi Region]]. Both the NMSP and the KNU were signatories of the NCA at the time of the fighting. A temporary bilateral truce was reached between the two groups on 14 March 2018.&lt;ref name="MMTimes14318"/&gt;

The '''National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance''' ('''NIHDI''') is a so-called federal public body of social security in [[Belgium]]. Under the authority of the Belgian federal minister of Social Affairs, it is responsible for administering the country's [[National health insurance|compulsory national schemes]] for [[health insurance]] and [[disability benefits]], and manages a compensation fund for [[Medical error|medical accidents]].

== Organisation ==
The institute was founded by the law of August 9, 1963 establishing and organizing a scheme for compulsory insurance for medical treatment and benefits, which came into force on January 1, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/eli/wet/1963/08/09/1963080914/justel|title=Wet van 9 augustus 1963 tot instelling en organisatie van een regeling voor verplichte verzekering voor geneeskundige verzorging en uitkeringen|publisher=[[Belgian official journal|Belgian Official Journal]]|date=1 November 1963|access-date=24 July 2018|language=Dutch|trans-title=Law of 9 August 1963 establishing and organizing a scheme for compulsory insurance for medical treatment and benefits}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law of 1963 has since been replaced by the law of July 14, 1994 regarding the compulsory insurance for medical treatment and benefits coordinated on July 14, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/eli/wet/1994/07/14/1994071451/justel|title=Wet van 14 juli 1994 betreffende de verplichte verzekering voor geneeskundige verzorging en uitkeringen gecoördineerd op 14 juli 1994

The institute's health and disability insurance budget for 2017 amounted to more than 37 billion euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.inami.fgov.be/SiteCollectionDocuments/jv2017_begroting.pdf|title=Begroting van de ziekte- en invaliditeitsverzekering – dienstjaar 2017|date=2018|publisher=NIHDI – Financial service|language=Dutch|trans-title=Budget for health and disability insurance – year of service 2017|format=pdf|access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

* '''Health insurance:''' the NIHDI makes rules concerning the [[reimbursement]] of costs for health services and establishes standard [[Price|prices]]. It manages and allocates the national budget for health reimbursements. The effective reimbursement of health service costs to patients is done by the different [[Health insurance cooperative|health insurance organisations]] that exist in Belgium (called ''mutualities''). The NIHDI also inspects the correct application of reimbursement rules.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.inami.fgov.be/SiteCollectionDocuments/folder-riziv-wat-waarom-voorwie.pdf|title=Het RIZIV – Wat, waarom, voor wie?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.inami.fgov.be|publisher=National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance|language=Dutch|trans-title=The NIHDI – What, why, for who?|format=pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Disability benefits:''' the NIHDI makes rules about the conditions required to receive benefits in case of labour incapacity caused by [[Disease|illness]] or [[injury]], [[Mother|motherhood]], [[Father|fatherhood]] or [[adoption]], establishes the amount of those benefits, and manages the financial support to incapacitated persons who want to start working again. It also combats [[disability fraud]] (a form of [[welfare fraud]]) by for example checking whether people receiving disability benefits aren't working and receiving a [[wage]] in secret. Just as with health reimbursements, the effective payment of benefits to entitled people is done by the ''mutualities''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Medical accidents:''' the NIHDI manages the Fund for Medical Accidents and examines whether victims of a medical accident have a right to [[Financial compensation|compensation]] from the fund. The NIHDI also advises, mediates, registers and reports in cases of medical accidents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3252">'''Rosely Roth''' (August 21, 1959 in [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]], [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]] – August 28, 1990 in São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil) is considered one of the pioneers in the history of the [[LGBT]] movement of Brazil (known in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as the ''Movimento Homossexual Brasileiro''). 

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Born of [[Jewish]] parents, she attended both Jewish and non-Jewish schools while growing up in her native São Paulo. In 1981 she obtained a degree in [[Philosophy]] from the [[Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo]]; and in 1985-1986 she graduated again from the same university with a degree in [[Anthropology]], having dedicated her studies on [[lesbian]] life and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] in São Paulo. 

===Women's movement===
Roth started her direct participation in the [[Feminist Movement|women's movement]] at the start of 1981 by attending meetings at the ''Grupo Lésbico Feminista'' (1979–1990) and at the ''SOS Mulher'' (1980–1993). Still in 1981, Roth and [[Míriam Martinho]], another [[Innovator|pioneer]] of the Brazilian LGBT movement, founded the ''Grupo Ação Lésbica-Feminista'' - ''GALF'' (1981–1990) in São Paulo. 

Roth was involved in many organizations and activities demanding [[sexual freedom]] and [[Civil rights|equal rights]] for [[lesbians]] and all members of the [[LGBT]] community during most of her adult life. She was particularly active in bringing visibility to related issues in the local and national media when the LGBT movement was still in its infancy in Brazil. 

===Death===
In the last phase of Roth's life, she started to suffer from what has been described as deep emotional problems. As a consequence, it is believed that her health condition led her to commit [[suicide]]. 

The ''Dia Nacional do Orgulho Lésbico,'' a national day of [[lesbian]] pride, celebrated annually throughout Brazil on August 19, since 2003, has been established in her honor.

The '''search engine manipulation effect''' (SEME) is the change in [[consumer behaviour|consumer preference]]s from [[Search engine manipulation|manipulations of search results]] by [[search engine]] providers. SEME is one of the largest behavioral effects ever discovered. This includes [[voting behaviour|voting preferences]]. A 2015 study indicated that such manipulations could shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by 20 percent or more and up to 80 percent in some demographics.&lt;ref name=poli&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Google Could Rig the 2016 Election|url = http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/how-google-could-rig-the-2016-election-121548.html?hp=rc3_4#.VduFK6sVhhH|accessdate = 2015-08-24|first = Robert|last = Epstein |date=August 19, 2015 |publisher=Politico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Robert|last2=Robertson|first2=Ronald E.|date=2015-08-18|title=The search engine manipulation effect (SEME) and its possible impact on the outcomes of elections|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/33/E4512|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=112|issue=33|pages=E4512–E4521|doi=10.1073/pnas.1419828112|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4547273|pmid=26243876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study estimated that this could change the outcome of upwards of 25 percent of national elections worldwide.

On the other hand, [[Google]] denies secretly re-ranking search results to manipulate user sentiment, or tweaking ranking specially for elections or political candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/google-2016-election-121766|title=A Flawed Elections Conspiracy Theory|website=POLITICO Magazine|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scenarios ==

At least three scenarios offer the potential to shape/decide elections. The management of a search engine could pick a candidate and adjust search rankings accordingly. Alternatively, a rogue employee who has sufficient authority and/or hacking skills could surreptitiously adjust the rankings. Finally, since rankings influence preferences even in the absence of overt manipulation, the ability of a candidate to raise his or her ranking via traditional [[search engine optimization]] would influence voter preferences. Simple notoriety could substantially increase support for a candidate.&lt;ref name=poli/&gt;

== Experiments ==

Five experiments were conducted with more than 4,500 participants in two countries. The experiments were randomized (subjects were randomly assigned to groups), controlled (including groups with and without interventions), counterbalanced (critical details, such as names, were presented to half the participants in one order and to half in the opposite order) and double-blind (neither subjects nor anyone who interacted with them knows the hypotheses or group assignments). The results were replicated four times.&lt;ref name=poli/&gt;

=== US ===

In experiments conducted in the United States, the proportion of people who favored any candidate rose by between 37 and 63 percent after a single search session.&lt;ref name=poli/&gt;

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups in which search rankings favored either Candidate A, Candidate B or neither candidate. Participants were given brief descriptions of each candidate and then asked how much they liked and trusted each candidate and whom they would vote for. Then they were allowed up to 15 minutes to conduct online research on the candidates using a manipulated search engine. Each group had access to the same 30 search results—each linking to real web pages from a past election. Only the ordering of the results differed in the three groups. People could click freely on any result or shift between any of five different results pages.&lt;ref name=poli/&gt;

After searching, on all measures, opinions shifted in the direction of the candidate favored in the rankings. Trust, liking and voting preferences all shifted predictably. 36 percent of those who were unaware of the rankings bias shifted toward the highest ranked candidate, along with 45 percent of those who were aware of the bias.&lt;ref name=poli/&gt;

Slightly reducing the bias on the first result page of search results – specifically, by including one search item that favoured the&amp;nbsp;other candidate in the third or fourth position masked the manipulation so that few or even&amp;nbsp;no subjects noticed the bias, while still triggering the preference change.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later research suggested that search rankings impact virtually all issues on which people are initially undecided around the world. Search results that favour one point of view tip the opinions of those who are undecided on an issue. In another experiment, biased search results shifted people’s opinions about the value of [[Hydraulic fracturing|fracking]] by 33.9 per cent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== India ===
A second experiment involved 2,000 eligible, undecided voters throughout India during the 2014 [[Lok Sabha]] election. The subjects were familiar with the candidates and were being bombarded with campaign rhetoric. Search rankings could boost the proportion of people favoring any candidate by more than 20 percent and more than 60 percent in some demographic groups.&lt;ref name="poli" /&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===

A UK experiment was conducted with nearly 4,000 people just before the 2015 national elections examined ways to prevent manipulation. Randomizing the rankings or including alerts that identify bias had some suppressive effects.&lt;ref name="poli" /&gt;

== European antitrust lawsuit ==
European regulators accused Google of manipulating its search engine results to favor its own services, even though competitive services would otherwise have ranked higher. As of August 2015, the complaint had not reached resolution, leaving the company facing a possible fine of up to $6 billion and tighter regulation that could limit its ability to compete in Europe. In November 2014 the European Parliament voted 384 to 174 for a symbolic proposal to break up the search giant into two pieces—its monolithic search engine and everything else.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Google’s $6 Billion Miscalculation on the EU|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-08-06/google-s-6-billion-miscalculation-on-the-eu|website = Bloomberg.com|accessdate = 2015-08-25|first = Vernon|last = Silver|last2 = Stone|first2 = Brad|date = August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case began in 2009 when Foundem, a British online shopping service, filed the first antitrust complaint against Google in Brussels. In 2007, Google had introduced a feature called Universal Search. A search for a particular city address, a stock quote, or a product price returned an answer from one of its own services, such as [[Google Maps]] or [[Google Finance]]. This saved work by the user. Later tools such as OneBox supplied answers to specific queries in a box at the top of search results. Google integrated profile pages, contact information and customer reviews from [[Google Plus]]. That information appeared above links to other websites that offered more comprehensive data, such as [[Yelp]] or [[TripAdvisor]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Google executives [[Larry Page]] and [[Marissa Mayer]], among others, privately advocated for favoring Google’s own services, even if its algorithms deemed that information less relevant or useful.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Google]] acknowledges adjusting its algorithm 600 times a year, but does not disclose the substance of its changes.&lt;ref name="poli" /&gt;

== 2016 Presidential election ==
In April 2015, [[Hillary Clinton]] hired [[Stephanie Hannon]]&amp;nbsp;from Google to be her [[chief technology officer]]. In 2015 [[Eric Schmidt]], chairman of Google's holding company started a company&amp;nbsp;– The Groundwork – for the specific purpose of electing Clinton. [[Julian Assange]], founder of [[WikiLeaks]], called Google her ‘secret weapon’. Researchers estimated that Google could help her win the nomination and could deliver between 2.6 and 10.4 million general election votes to Clinton via SEME. No evidence documents any such effort, although since search results are ephemeral, evidence could only come via a Google [[whistleblower]] or an external [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On June 9, 2016, [[SourceFed]] alleged that Google manipulated its searches in favor of Clinton because the recommended searches for her are different than the recommended searches to both [[Yahoo]] and [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] and yet the searches for both [[Donald Trump]] and [[Bernie Sanders]] are identical to both Yahoo and Bing. When "Hillary Clinton Ind" was entered in the search bar, Google Autocomplete suggested "Hillary Clinton Indiana", while the other vendors suggested "Hillary Clinton indictment". Furthermore, SourceFed placed the recommended searches for Clinton on [[Google Trends]] and observed that the Google suggestion was searched less than the suggestion from the other vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hern|first1=Alex|title=Google Manipulating Search In Favor Of Hillary Clinton?|url=http://techaeris.com/2016/06/10/google-manipulating-results-favor-hillary-clinton/|website=Techaeris|accessdate=10 June 2016|date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= Richardson|first1=Valerie |title=Google accused of burying negative Hillary Clinton stories|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/9/google-accused-burying-negative-hillary-clinton-st/|accessdate=10 June 2016|work=The Washington Times|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/google-appears-to-be-manipulating-search-results-to-help-hillary-clinton/article/2593562|title=Google denies manipulating search results to favor Hillary Clinton|last=TAKALA|first=RUDY|date=2016-06-11|website=Washington Examiner|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6258">The '''National Tax Investigation Police (SR)''' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: {{lang|is|Skattrannsóknarstjóri Ríkisins}}), also known as the '''Directorate of Tax Investigations in [[Iceland]]''', is one of Iceland’s [[List of intelligence agencies#Iceland|three intelligence agencies]]. The SR is responsible for investigating legal cases where suspicions of [[tax fraud]], [[tax evasion]], or other violations of [[tax law]] are found within Iceland. The SR is accountable to the [[Ministry of Finance (Iceland)|Icelandic Minister of Finance]], [[Benedikt Jóhannesson]].&lt;ref name=Skattrannsóknarstjóri&gt;[https://www.fjarmalaraduneyti.is/raduneytid/stofnanir/erindisbref/nr/9205 Skattrannsóknarstjóri ríkisins, November 4, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and organization==
The SR was founded in 1993 with the goal of functioning as a specialized and autonomous intelligence agency focused specifically on the [[Taxation in Iceland|tax system]]. The director of the SR is appointed by, and responsible only to, the [[Ministry of Finance (Iceland)|Minister of Finance]]. While the central SR office is located in Reykjavík, the office still investigates all alleged tax crimes in all of Iceland’s nine [[Administrative divisions of Iceland|tax districts]] of [[Reykjavík]], [[Akranes]], [[Ísafjörður]], [[Siglufjörður]], [[Akureyri]], [[Egilsstaðir]], [[Hella, Iceland|Hella]], [[Vestmannaeyjar]] and [[Hafnarfjörður]].&lt;ref name=Office&gt;[http://www.xn--skattrannsknarstjri-94bh.is/english.asp The Directorate of Tax Investigations in Iceland]&lt;/ref&gt;
The SR operates under Icelandic regulation and law nos. 361/1995, 50/1988, 45/1987, 113/1990, 145/1994, 144/1990, and 37/1993.&lt;ref name="Skattrannsóknarstjóri"/&gt;

===Budget===
The SR has 24 employees, most of whom have university degrees in business, economics, or law. In 2006 the SR’s allotted budget was [[Icelandic króna|ISK]] 155m or ~$2.2m [[United States dollar|USD]]. The SR submits an annual budget to the [[Ministry of Finance (Iceland)|Ministry of Finance]] by February 15 each year. The report includes a report on the SR’ operations and activities as well as a balance sheet for the previous year.&lt;ref name="Skattrannsóknarstjóri"/&gt;

==Purpose==
The main role of the SR is to investigate and inform on the infringement of Icelandic tax laws, and reduce [[tax evasion]]. The SR is tasked with three central objectives by the Ministry of Finance.&lt;ref name=Office /&gt;
# Investigate all cases where there is a suspected presence of [[tax fraud]].
# To represent the state of Iceland in legal cases in which a penalty procedure is conducted through a closed administrative action by the [[Ministry of Finance (Iceland)|State Internal Revenue Board]].
# The preparation of major cases for criminal proceedings, and for further investigation by both the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police and the [[Directorate of Public Prosecutions]].

There are two objectives of SR investigations:&lt;ref name=Directorate&gt;[http://www.srs.is/english The Directorate of Tax Investigations in Iceland]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Conclusions of SR investigations must be a basis for [[tax assessment]].
# Conclusions of SR investigations must serve as a basis for possible criminal proceedings.

The SR is tasked with investigating violations of all Icelandic tax laws levied or enforced by the Directorate of Internal Revenue, and violations of the Accounting Act and Financial Statements Act. Any other activities fall outside the SR’ scope of authority. Once a tax investigation case has concluded, the SR decides whether or not criminal proceedings are initiated. If criminal proceedings are initiated, they may proceed in three manners. The taxpayer is fined an amount deemed necessary by the SR, the SR presents a payment claim before the State Internal Revenue Board, or the case is referred to the [[Icelandic Police]].&lt;ref name=Office /&gt;
Each year, the SR investigates ~100 [[tax fraud]] cases. Tax fraud in Iceland tends to be concentrated in the restaurant and food industries.&lt;ref name=Office /&gt;

==Relationship with district tax offices==
When a district tax office finds an Icelandic taxpayer in breach of [[tax law]] after conducting their general tax control, the SR receives the case from the district tax office. Any case where there is a suspicion of possible [[tax fraud]], it is required by law to be reported to the SR.&lt;ref name=Office /&gt;
The SR can also receive cases from state tax collectors, and the [[Icelandic police|police]] if technical expertise is needed in accounting or fraud cases.&lt;ref name=Office /&gt;

==Successes==
Since its inception, the SR has implemented major changes in how the [[Politics of Iceland|Icelandic government]] combats tax crimes. Thanks to the SR’s efforts, approximately [[Icelandic króna|ISK]] 4 billion or ~$58 million [[United States dollar|USD]] has been collected as a direct result of SR’s proceedings over the “past several years”.&lt;ref name=Office /&gt;

===2015 Tax evasion case===
In 2015, the SR released a statement that a whistle blower who had offered them data and documents relating to tax evasion by people linked to Iceland requested ISK 150 million (~$1.1 million USD). The information in question was a large leak of sensitive information reportedly showing that [[The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]] (HSBC) had assisted clients worldwide in tax evasion. The SR had initially requested government support to pay for the data, however former Minister of Finance Bjanri Benediktsson later stated that the SR would only pay for the data if the fee was in proportion to the collected tax from the accounts in question. One of the six individuals in the SR’s investigation is an [[Icelandic passport]] holder, while the other 5 have other ties to the country.&lt;ref name=Icelandreview&gt;[http://icelandreview.com/news/2015/02/11/wants-isk-150-million-tax-evader-info Wants ISK 150 Million for Tax Evader Info]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spanish Alternative''' ({{lang-es|link=no|Alternativa Española}}, '''AES''') ({{audio|Es-es alternativa española.ogg|listen}}) is a nationwide Spanish Catholic political party, whose ideology is framed within the conservative right-wing.&lt;ref name="Derecha" /&gt; It describes itself as "social Christian and cross-sectional".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=6 March 2008|title=Alternativa Española defiende «valores sociales basados en las raíces cristianas»|url=http://www.laverdad.es/alicante/20080306/provincia/alternativa-espanola-defiende-valores-20080306.html|work=La Verdad|language=Spanish|access-date=20 October 2017|quote=Como «una opción transversal de orientación social cristiana» define la propuesta de Alternativa Española (AES) su portavoz nacional, Francisco Torres García, que participó en sendos actos electorales en Elche y Alicante}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its Secretary General is the lawyer and businessman Rafael López-Diéguez, former member of the far-right [[New Force (Spain)|New Force]], active formation during the Transition and managed by his father-in-law, the historic leader Blas Piñar, who was named honorary president of AES, a post which he held until his death in January 2014. Although AES doesn't use symbols of Franco's regime, the party has been described as neo-francoist as well as being considered to be inheritor of New Force.&lt;ref name="Rodríguez Jiménez" /&gt; It maintains contacts with the party Navarrese and Spanish Right (DNE).

==Ideology==
AES holds its program declaration and its public action in four principles: the "defense of life" (opposition to any type of abortion), the "pro-family", "Christian roots" and the "unity of Spain". When the party has to place itself on the political spectrum, AES defines itself as a cross-sectional party that is positioned on the right in moral matter and on the left in social and economic matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Vaquero Oroquieta|first1=Fernando José|year=2005|title=Entrevista a Rafael López–Dieguez: la conquista de un espacio|url=http://www.arbil.org/97vaqu.htm|magazine=Arbil|volume=97|issn=1697-1388|access-date=20 October 2017|quote=Si tuviera que definir AES con los estereotipos de la sociología política actual, estaríamos posicionados a la derecha del PP en materia moral y a su izquierda en materia social y económica. En definitiva, somos un partido transversal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, AES considers homosexual adoption to be an attack on the family and is against same-sex marriages and even same-sex civil unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diarioya.es/content/aes-y-el-fracaso-esta-es-la-carta-que-han-recibido-los-militantes-de-aes|title="AES y el fracaso": Esta es la carta que han recibido los militantes de AES|accessdate=20 October 2017|work=Diario ya|language=es|date=29 March 2015|quote=Pero pese a nuestro interés de aunar esfuerzos y el rechazo de Vox a construir una alternativa, la unión por el momento desafortunadamente se ha vuelto imposible al haber confirmado recientemente el Sr. Abascal que se reafirma sobre la legitimidad de las uniones homosexuales, para nosotros uno de los principios no negociables}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as akin to "fundamentalist Catholicism".

Spanish Alternative takes a hard line on the Autonomic State by proposing to abolish the autonomous communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertadigital.com/2012/09/10/entrevista-de-ad-a-francisco-torres-portavoz-de-aes-o-ponemos-fin-al-estado-de-las-autonomias-o-ellas-acaban-con-espana/ Entrevista de AD a Francisco Torres, portavoz de AES: “O ponemos fin al Estado de las Autonomías o ellas acaban con España”], ''Alerta Digital''&lt;/ref&gt; To the party's mind, the State of Autonomies is unviable and unsustainable because it constitutes an economic catastrophe, because it has been the main contributory factor to the present crisis, because it promotes the breach of the national integrity and cohesion in its continuing development and because it entails unequal rights among Spaniards depending on their place of birth or residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativaespanola.com/galerias/docs/13371357832645.pdf|title=¿Está usted de acuerdo con la supresión de las Autonomías?|author=Alternativa Española|website=alternativaespanola.com|language=Spanish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227061032/http://www.alternativaespanola.com/galerias/docs/13371357832645.pdf|archive-date=27 December 2013|dead-url=yes|access-date=20 October 2017|quote=En la certeza de que el actual Estado de las Autonomías no sólo es inviable sino que además resulta insostenible; que constituye una lacra económica; que ha sido elemento coadyuvante fundamental -como factor propio- de la actual crisis, que en su permanente desarrollo impulsa la ruptura de la integridad y la cohesión nacional, que conlleva la desigualdad de derechos entre los españoles en función de su lugar de nacimiento o residencia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, AES would keep the provincial privileges of Navarre and the Basque Country.

==Election results==
In the [[Spanish local elections, 2015|municipal elections of 2015]] the party gained 5 town councillors. 2 in [[Las Labores]] and 1 in [[Ampuero]], [[Bárcena de Pie de Concha]] and [[Villanueva de la Condesa]].

'''Teachers Without Borders''' (''TWB'') is an international organization launched in 2000, with a mission to connect teachers to information and each other in order to close the education divide and based  upon the premise that teachers are community change agents and key catalysts of global development priorities. The organization was founded by [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/founder/ Dr. Fred Mednick]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} 

Teachers Without Borders received the '''[https://luxembourgpeaceprize.org/laureates/outstanding-peace-education/2018-teachers-without-borders/ 2018 Luxembourg Peace Prize]''' for Outstanding Peace Education, recognized for a free Peace Education program involving teachers from regions in conflict, for having embedded peace education into all TWB courses (see below), and its Voice of Teachers Radio Show in Nigeria. 

Teachers Without Borders received the [https://www.changemakers.com/champions-quality-education-africa '''Champions of African Education Award'''] (2010) for its use of radio and local educational capacity building to disseminate information about the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. In 2018, TWB's membership has reached 177 countries. Teachers Without Borders membership is free and enables local educators the opportunity to connect with colleagues globally.

Teachers Without Borders also received the '''[http://peacesymposium.org.uk/the-ahmadiyya-muslim-peace-prize Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize]''' for "outstanding work in the promotion of peace through efforts to convene teachers from regions in conflict, provide unfettered access to courses and networks devoted to teacher professional development, and to ensure that peace education is integrated into all initiatives. The formal announcement can be viewed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viaSBMQxcAk&amp;t=9s '''here'''].

==Approach==
Teachers Without Borders claims that teachers represent the largest professional community in the world (over 65 million); that teachers are uniquely suited as local leaders to recognize and help address development needs; that professional isolation and inconsequential or missing teacher professional development undermines social change; and that the transformation of pre-service and in-service teacher development can bring about more sustainable, equitable, democratic, and economically stable societies.

==Initiatives and Courses==
Teachers Without Borders' initiatives and courses are offered in various formats and settings: online, in schools, as community workshops, in books and journals, and on the radio. All programs have been conceived and led by Teachers Without Borders' members and partners around the world. Content of all TWB [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/allcourses/ '''courses'''] and [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/training-resources/ workshop resources] are free and governed by the least restrictive Creative Commons license.

The 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] ended the major war known by Americans as the [[French and Indian War]] and by Canadians as the [[Seven Years' War]] / Guerre de Sept Ans, or by French-Canadians, [[Guerre de la conquete|La Guerre de la Conquête]].  It was signed by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Spain]], with [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] in agreement.  Preferring to keep [[Guadeloupe]], France gave up [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] and all of its claims to territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain.  With France out of North America this dramatically changed the European political scene on the continent.

At first only the imperial powers of Europe had the resources to support and expand settlements in North America.  As time went on the colonies became more powerful and sought independence from the Old World. These demands for more autonomy sparked several wars, including the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783) and the [[Mexican War of Independence]] (1810–1821). The last major colonial power on the continent, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], granted [[dominion]] status to [[Canadian Confederation|Canada]] in 1867 and slowly [[Territorial evolution of Canada|turned over its remaining land]] to that country over the next 100 years, with the last land transfer being the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] in 1949. Throughout this period, France maintained the small North American territory of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] off the coast of the island of Newfoundland.&lt;ref name="cia.gov.france"&gt;{{cite web |year= 2009 |url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sb.html|title = Saint Pierre and Miquelon|work =[[USA.gov]] |publisher = [[Central Intelligence Agency]]| accessdate = November 14, 2009 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From independence, the United States [[Territorial evolution of the United States|expanded rapidly to the west]], [[Louisiana Purchase|acquiring the massive Louisiana territory]] in 1803 and fighting [[Mexican–American War|a war with Mexico]] to push west to the [[Pacific]].  At the same time, British settlement in Canada increased.  US expansion was complicated by the division between "free" and "slave" states, which led to the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820.  Likewise, Canada faced tensions between settlers, including [[French Canadian|French]] and [[English Canadian|English]] communities, and the colonial administration that led to the outbreak of [[Rebellions of 1837|civil strife in 1837]].  Mexico faced constant political tensions between liberals and conservatives, as well as the rebellion of the English-speaking region of Texas, which declared itself the [[Republic of Texas]] in 1836.  In 1845, Texas joined the United States and in 1867 the United States acquired Alaska from Russia.  The last major territorial change occurred when [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] joined Canada in 1949,&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt; but there have been a number of small adjustments like the [[Boundary Treaty of 1970]] where the city of [[Rio Rico, Texas]], was ceded to Mexico.&lt;ref name="Miller pp. 13-21"/&gt;

The borders of [[Ontario]] were provisionally expanded north and west. When the Province of Canada was formed, its borders were not entirely clear, and Ontario claimed to eventually reach all the way to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Arctic Ocean]]. With Canada's acquisition of [[Rupert's Land]], Ontario was interested in clearly defining its borders, especially since some of the new areas it was interested in were rapidly growing. After the federal government asked Ontario to pay for construction in the new disputed area, the province asked for an elaboration on its limits, and its boundary was moved north to the [[51st parallel north]].&lt;ref name="Mills p. 347"&gt;{{harvnb|Mills|1877|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It was resolved by arbitration in 1903, generally favoring the American claim.&lt;ref name="D.M.L.FARR"&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0000107|title = Alaska Boundary Dispute|publisher = The Canadian Encyclopedia © 2009 Historica Foundation of Canada.| accessdate = 2009-05-02 | last=D.M.L.

The [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] was a [[Dominion|British dominion]] from 1907 (before which the territory had the status of a [[United Kingdom|British]] colony, self-governing from 1855) to 1949.

Newfoundland never became independent according to the modern meaning of the word. The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] would have made Newfoundland much closer to being independent, but not completely. However, the government of Newfoundland did not ratify it, and furthermore, abolished itself in 1934 because of bankruptcy.

Maps prior to 1927 wildly disagreed on the actual position of the border, instead of agreeing upon marking the area as being disputed. Maps after 1927 tended to agree with the decision, but due to protests, some mapmakers in [[Quebec]] still disagreed. In the 60's, logos of the two biggest political parties of Quebec (PLQ &amp; UN) both included the shape of the province as including ''all'' of Labrador. Disagreements persist even today (to a lesser extent), as Quebec insists on including the rest of the gulf's basin in its maps, separated with a dotted line saying ''1927 border, non-final''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/images/carte-2011/circonscriptions/745.gif&lt;/ref&gt; Newfoundland complains in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;http://globalnews.ca/news/1257709/quebec-election-map-revives-controversy-over-labrador-border-dispute/&lt;/ref&gt; even though older electoral maps showed the same.

[[Norway]] asserted its claim of sovereignty over the [[Sverdrup Islands]]. The islands are named after Norwegian explorer [[Otto Sverdrup]], who explored and mapped them from 1898 to 1902 with the vessel ''[[Fram]]'', although some were previously inhabited by [[Inuit]] people. Sverdrup claimed the islands for Norway, but the Norwegian government showed no interest in pursuing the claim until 1928. At that point, the Norwegian government raised the claim, primarily to use the islands as bargaining chips in negotiations with the [[United Kingdom]] over the status of the Arctic island [[Jan Mayen]] and the Antarctic [[Bouvet Island]].&lt;ref name="Berton p. 629"&gt;{{harvnb|Berton|1988|p=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Citizen''''' is a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]-style newspaper distributed nationally in South Africa. While its core readership is mainly in Gauteng, it also distributes to surrounding provinces such as Mpumalanga, Limpopo and the North West. In 1998, ''The Citizen'' was acquired by [[CTP/Caxton]]. Its core readership is black middle-class men.{{fact | date=July 2018}}

==History==
The paper was founded in 1976 during the apartheid era by [[Louis Luyt]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton Harber]], (September 13, 2006). [http://www.theharbinger.co.za/wordpress/2006/09/13/lies-truth-and-good-citizen-ship/ "Lies, truth and good Citizen-ship"], ''The Harbinger'' Retrieved March 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; at which time it was the only major English-language newspaper favourable to the ruling [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]. In 1978, during the [[Muldergate Scandal]], it was revealed that the money to establish and finance the newspaper had come from a secret [[slush fund]] of the Department of Information, and ultimately from the Department of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africacrime-mystery.co.za/books/fsac/chp19.htm "Eschel Rhoodie, 1979/80"], Rob Marsh. Retrieved March 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the paper was bought by Caxton and CTP Publishers and Printers Limited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citizen.co.za/about-us/|title=About us - The Citizen - The Citizen|website=citizen.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the largest publishers and printers in South Africa. The company is involved in various fields of publishing and printing such as newspapers, magazines, commercial print, book printing, stationery, packaging and labels, as well as manufacturing ink for web presses.

In 2012, Eureka Zandberg took over from Greg Stewart as the publisher of ''The Citizen''. Along with Editor Martin Williams, she brought in renowned design guru Dr. Mario Garcia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://garciamedia.com/blog/articles/pthe_citizen_of_south_africa_its_a_totally_new_product._p|title=Blog: The Citizen of South Africa: it’s a totally new product. × García Media|website=García Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; to give the newspaper a complete revamp. In Dr. Garcia's words, "In South Africa, The Citizen decided to face those challenges and seize the opportunities, while sending a message to its devoted readers: ''you have changed, and so have we''." The new edition hit the streets on 1 August 2013.

Zandberg told South African media blogsite GrubStreet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grubstreet.co.za/2013/08/13/the-citizens-revamp-is-phase-1-of-its-digital-evolution-publisher-eureka-zandberg/|title=Grub Street - Your Business News Digest|website=Grub Street}}&lt;/ref&gt; that while ''The Citizen'' had had makeovers before, it was never to the extent of this one: "If you put ''The Citizen'' next to other papers, it felt tired. We thought that we owed our readers a face lift, a better product and a better experience."

In addition to a revamp of the physical print edition, ''The Citizen''{{'}}s digital evolution is also underway. The same day the new paper's look was revealed, the website went live, with a fresh look and more responsive design adaptable to mobile, tablet and desktop. Going forward ''The Citizen'' plans to offer more mobile and tablet options. 

On 7 October 2013, ''The Citizen'' announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/90/101399.html|title=New editor for The Citizen, Steve Motale - The Citizen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Editor Martin Williams would be stepping down. Williams, who had been with ''The Citizen'' for 19 years, and contributed to its many successes, retired at the end of October. 

His replacement was named as Steve Motale, who at the time was the executive editor of ''Pretoria News''. Motale had started off as a reporter at ''The Citizen'' in 2002, later becoming political editor and then editor of ''Citizen Metro''.

==''Saturday Citizen''==
The sport-focused weekly paper formerly known as the ''Super Saturday Citizen'' is published every Saturday. After the revamp under Dr. Garcia it was titled simply ''Saturday Citizen''.

[[File:Rebeccawalker.jpg|thumb|[[Rebecca Walker]] in 2003. The term ''third wave'' is credited to Walker's 1992 article, "Becoming the Third Wave".&lt;ref name=Walker1992/&gt;]]


'''Third-wave feminism'''  is an iteration of the [[feminist movement]] that began in the early 1990s [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Elizabeth|year=2015|title=The Politics of Third Wave Feminisms: Neoliberalism, Intersectionality, and the State in Britain and the US|location=London|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|at=22|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued until the [[fourth-wave feminism|fourth wave]] began around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicola|last=Rivers|title=Postfeminism(s) and the Arrival of the Fourth Wave|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2017|at=8|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|authorlink=Kira Cochrane|title=The Fourth Wave of Feminism: Meet the Rebel Women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in the 1960s and 1970s as members of [[Generation X]], and grounded in the civil-rights advances of the [[second-wave feminism|second wave]], third-wave feminists embraced [[individualism]] and [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] and sought to redefine what it meant to be a feminist.{{sfn|Evans|2015|loc=22}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/feminism/The-third-wave-of-feminism#ref1228639 "The Third Wave of Feminism"], ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards"&gt;{{cite book |title=Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism, and the Future |last1=Baumgardner |first1=Jennifer |author1-link=Jennifer Baumgardner |last2=Richards |first2=Amy |author2-link=Amy Richards |year=2000 |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-374-52622-1 |p=77|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to feminist scholar Elizabeth Evans, the "confusion surrounding what constitutes third-wave feminism is in some respects its defining feature."{{sfn|Evans|2015|loc=49}}

The third wave is traced to the emergence of the [[Riot grrrl]] feminist [[punk subculture]] in [[Olympia, Washington]], in the early 1990s,{{efn|Steve Feliciano (New York Public Library, 2013): "The emergence of the Riot Grrrl movement began in the early 1990s, when a group of women in Olympia, Washington, held a meeting to discuss how to address sexism in the punk scene. The women decided they wanted to start a 'girl riot' against a society they felt offered no validation of women's experiences. And thus the Riot Grrrl movement was born."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feliciano|first1=Steve|title=The Riot Grrrl Movement|url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/06/19/riot-grrrl-movement|publisher=New York Public Library|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and to [[Anita Hill]]'s televised testimony in 1991—to an all-male, all-white [[Senate Judiciary Committee]]—that [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas]], nominated for the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], had [[Sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] her. The term ''third wave'' is credited to [[Rebecca Walker]], who responded to Thomas's appointment to the Supreme Court with an article in ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine, "Becoming the Third Wave" (1992).&lt;ref name=Walker1992&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Walker| first1 = Rebecca | authorlink1 = Rebecca Walker| editor-last=| editor-first =| editor-link=| title = Becoming the Third Wave| journal = [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]| issue = | pages = 39–41| location = | issn = 0047-8318| oclc = 194419734|date= January 1992|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2002/BecomingThirdWaveRebeccaWalker.pdf|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards"/&gt; She wrote:

{{quote|So I write this as a plea to all women, especially women of my generation: Let Thomas' confirmation  serve to remind you, as it did me, that the fight is far from over. Let this dismissal of a woman's experience move you to anger. Turn that outrage into political power. Do not vote for them unless they work for us. Do not have sex with them, do not break bread with them, do not nurture them if they don't prioritize our freedom to control our bodies and our lives. I am not a post-feminism feminist. I am the Third Wave.&lt;ref name="Walker1992" /&gt;}}

Walker sought to establish that third-wave feminism was not just a reaction, but a movement in itself, because the feminist cause had more work ahead. The term ''[[intersectionality]]''—to describe the idea that women experience "layers of oppression" caused, for example, by gender, race and class—had been introduced by [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw]] in 1989, and it was during the third wave that the concept flourished.{{sfn|Evans|2015|loc=19}} As feminists came online in the late 1990s and early 2000s and reached a global audience with blogs and e-[[zine]]s, they broadened their goals, focusing on abolishing gender-role stereotypes and expanding feminism to include women with diverse racial and cultural identities.&lt;ref name=Brunell2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite book |last=Tong |first=Rosemarie |title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction |year=2009 |edition=Third |publisher=Westview Press |location=Boulder, CO |isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4 |oclc=156811918 |pages=284–285, 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The third wave saw the emergence of new feminist currents and theories, such as [[intersectionality]], [[Sex positive feminism|sex positivity]], [[vegetarian ecofeminism]], [[transfeminism]], and [[postmodern feminism]].

== History ==
{{Further|First-wave feminism|Second-wave feminism|Feminist sex wars|Fourth-wave feminism}}
The rights and programs gained by feminists of the second wave served as a foundation for the third wave. The gains included [[Title IX]] (equal access to education); public discussion about the abuse and rape of women; access to contraception and other reproductive services (including the legalization of abortion); the creation and enforcement of sexual-harassment policies for women in the workplace; the creation of domestic-abuse shelters for women and children; child-care services; educational funding for young women; and [[women's studies]] programs.

Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave such as [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], [[bell hooks]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], and other feminists of color, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of race.&lt;ref name="Gillis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heywood"&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Heywood|editor-first=Leslie|editor2-last=Drake|editor2-first=Jennifer|title=Third Wave Agenda: Being Feminist, Doing Feminism|year=1997|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|location=[[Minneapolis]]|isbn=978-0-8166-3005-9|oclc=36876149}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cherríe Moraga]] and [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa]] had published the anthology ''[[This Bridge Called My Back]]'' (1981), which, along with ''[[All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave]]'' (1982), edited by [[Akasha Gloria Hull|Akasha (Gloria T.) Hull]], [[Patricia Bell-Scott]], and [[Barbara Smith]], argued that second-wave feminism had focused primarily on the problems of white women. The emphasis on the intersection between race and gender became increasingly prominent.

In the interlude of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the [[feminist sex wars]] arose as a reaction against the [[radical feminism]] of the second wave and [[Feminist views on sexuality|its views on sexuality]], therein countering with a concept of "[[Sex-positive feminism|sex-positivity]]" and heralding the third wave.&lt;ref name="end"&gt;As noted in:

===Riot grrrl===

[[File:Kathleen Hanna live in Bikini Kill in 1991.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kathleen Hanna]], lead singer of [[Bikini Kill]] 1991]]
The emergence of [[riot grrrl]], the feminist [[punk subculture]], in the early 1990s in [[Olympia, Washington]], marked the beginning of third-wave feminism.&lt;ref name=Piepmeier2009p45&gt;{{cite book|first=Alison|last=Piepmeier|title=Girl Zines: Making Media, Doing Feminism|location=New York|publisher=New York University Press|year=2009|p=45|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The triple "r" in ''grrrl'' was intended to reclaim the word ''girl'' for women.&lt;ref name=Rowe-Finbeiner&gt;{{cite book |title=The F Word: Feminism in Jeopardy|last=Rowe-Finkbeiner |first=Kristin |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Seal Press |location=Emeryville, CA|p=85|isbn=978-1-58005-114-9|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alison Piepmeier]] writes that riot grrrl and [[Sarah Dyer]]'s ''Action Girl Newsletter'' formulated "a style, rhetoric, and iconography for grrrl [[zines]]" that came to define third-wave feminism,&lt;ref name=Piepmeier2009p45/&gt; and that focused on the viewpoint of adolescent girls.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, Chelsea (2000). "Adolescent girls and feminism", in Code, Lorraine (ed.). ''Encyclopedia of Feminist Theories''. London and New York: Routledge, p. 3. {{ISBN|0-415-30885-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on hard-core [[punk rock]], the movement created zines and art, talked about rape, patriarchy, sexuality, and female empowerment, started chapters, and supported and organized women in music.&lt;ref name=Schilt&gt;Schilt, Kristen (2003). "'A Little Too Ironic': The Appropriation and Packaging of Riot Grrrl Politics by Mainstream Female Musicians", in ''Popular Music and Society'', 26.&lt;/ref&gt; An undated [[Bikini Kill]] tour flier asked "What is Riot grrrl?":

{{quote|BECAUSE in every form of media I see us/myself slapped, decapitated, laughed at, objectified, raped, trivialized, pushed, ignored, stereotyped, kicked, scorned, molested, silenced, invalidated, knifed, shot, choked, and killed.&amp;nbsp;... BECAUSE a safe space needs to be created for girls where we can open our eyes and reach out to each other without being threatened by this sexist society and our day to day bullshit.&amp;nbsp;... BECAUSE we girls want to create mediums that speak to US. We are tired of boy band after boy band, boy zine after boy zine, boy punk after boy punk after boy. BECAUSE I am tired of these things happening to me; I'm not a fuck toy. I'm not a punching bag. I'm not a joke.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last = Darms|editor1-first = Lisa|title = The Riot Grrrl Collection|publisher = The Feminist Press at the City University of New York|year= 2013 |isbn = 1558618228|at = 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Riot grrrl was grounded in the [[DIY ethic|DIY philosophy]] of [[Punk ideologies#Punk ethics|punk values]], adopting an [[anti-corporate]] stance of [[self-sufficiency]] and self-reliance.&lt;ref name=Rowe-Finbeiner/&gt; Its emphasis on universal female identity and separatism often appeared more closely allied with second-wave feminism.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg_Garofalo&gt;Rosenberg, Jessica and Gitana, Garofalo (Spring 1998). "Riot Grrrl: Revolutions from within", ''Signs'', 23(3). {{jstor|3175311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bands associated with the movement included [[Bratmobile]], [[Excuse 17]], [[Jack Off Jill]], [[Free Kitten]], [[Heavens to Betsy]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], [[L7 (band)|L7]], [[Fifth Column (band)|Fifth Column]], and [[Team Dresch]].&lt;ref name=Schilt/&gt;

Riot grrrl culture gave people the space to enact change on a macro, meso and micro scale. As Kevin Dunn explains:&lt;blockquote&gt;Using the do-it-yourself ethos of punk to provide resources for individual empowerment, Riot Grrrl encouraged females to engage in multiple sites of resistance. At the macro-level, Riot Grrrls resist society’s dominant constructions of femininity. At the meso-level, they resist stiﬂing gender roles in punk. At the micro-level, they challenge gender constructions in their families and among their peers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunn|first=Kevin C.|date=2014-04-03|title=Pussy Rioting|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F14616742.2014.919103|journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=317–334|doi=10.1080/14616742.2014.919103|issn=1461-6742}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The demise of riot grrrl is linked to commodification and misrepresentation of its message, mainly through media coverage. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Anita Hill===
{{main|Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination}}
[[File:Anita Hill at Harvard Law School Sep 2014.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Anita Hill]], 2014]]
In 1991 [[Anita Hill]] accused [[Clarence Thomas]], an African-American judge who had been nominated to the [[United States Supreme Court]], of [[sexual harassment]]. Thomas denied the accusations, calling them a "high-tech lynching". After extensive debate, the [[United States Senate]] voted 52–48 in favor of Thomas.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Walker|first=Rebecca|title=To Be Real: Telling the Truth and Changing the Face of Feminism|year=1995|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-385-47262-3|oclc=32274323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heywood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gillis|first=Stacy|last2=Howie|first2=Gillian|last3=Munford|first3=Rebecca|title=Third Wave Feminism: A Critical Exploration|year=2004|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn=978-1-4039-1821-5|oclc=54454680}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, ''Ms. Magazine'' published an article by [[Rebecca Walker]], entitled "Becoming the Third Wave", in which she stated: "I am not a post-feminism feminist. I am the third wave." Many had argued that Thomas should be acquitted because of his plans to create opportunities for people of color. When Walker asked her partner his opinion and he said the same thing, she asked: "When will progressive black men prioritize my rights and well-being?" She wanted racial equality but without dismissing women.&lt;ref name="Walker1992"/&gt;

In 1992, dubbed the "[[Year of the Woman]]", four women enter the [[United States Senate]] to join the two already there. The following year another woman, [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]], won a special election, bringing the number to seven. The 1990s saw the first female [[Attorney General of the United States|United States Attorney General]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], as well as the second woman on the Supreme Court, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and the first US [[First Lady]], [[Hillary Clinton]], to have had an independent political, legal and activist career.

==Purpose==
&lt;!--check and re-write: The shift from second-wave feminism came about with the legal and institutional rights that were extended to women. In addition to these institutional gains, third-wave feminists believed there needed to be further changes in stereotypes, media portrayals, and language to define women. The purpose was to celebrate diverse identities.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rachelyon1.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/third-wave-feminism.pdf|title=Third-wave feminism and individualism: promoting equality or reinforcing the status quo?|last=Iannello|first=Katherine P.|date=|year=1998|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Arguably the biggest challenge to third-wave feminism was that the gains of second-wave feminism were taken for granted, and the importance of feminism not understood. Baumgardner and Richards (2000) wrote: "[F]or anyone born after the early 1960's, the presence of feminism in our lives is taken for granted. For our generation, feminism is like fluoride. We scarcely notice that we have it—it's simply in the water."&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards" /&gt;

Essentially the claim was that gender equality had already been achieved, via the first two waves, and further attempts to push for women's rights were irrelevant and unnecessary, or perhaps even pushed the pendulum too far in women's favor. This issue manifested itself in the heated debates about whether affirmative action was creating gender equality or punishing white, middle-class males for the biological history that they had inherited.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Jacquetta A. and Linda A. White (2012). ''Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women''.

Third-wave feminists often engaged in "micro-politics", and challenged the second wave's paradigm as to what was good for women.&lt;ref name="Freedman"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Freedman|first=Estelle B. |title=No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and the Future of Women|year=2002 |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]] |location=London| oclc=49193867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Henry|first=Astrid |title=Not My Mother's Sister: Generational Conflict and Third-Wave Feminism|year=2004|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=[[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] |oclc=53932637}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillis"&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Gillis| editor-first=Stacy|editor2-last=Howie| editor2-first=Gillian| editor3-last=Munford| editor3-first=Rebecca |title=Third Wave Feminism: A Critical Exploration|edition=Expanded Second| year=2007| publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=[[Basingstoke]] |isbn=978-0-230-52174-2| oclc=77795615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Faludi"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Faludi| first=Susan| title=Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women |year=1991 |publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group]] |location=New York| isbn=978-0-517-57698-4| oclc=23016353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of third-wave feminism said that it allowed women to define feminism for themselves.  Describing third-wave feminism in ''Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism And The Future'' (2000), [[Jennifer Baumgardner]] and [[Amy Richards]] suggested that feminism could change with every generation and individual:

{{quote|The fact that feminism is no longer limited to arenas where we expect to see it—[[National Organization for Women|NOW]], ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'', [[women's studies]], and redsuited [[Member of Congress|congresswomen]]—perhaps means that young women today have really reaped what feminism has sown. Raised after [[Title IX]] and ''[[William's Doll|William Wants a Doll]]'' {{sic}}, young women emerged from college or high school or two years of marriage or their first job and began challenging some of the received wisdom of the past ten or twenty years of feminism. We're not doing feminism the same way that the seventies feminists did it; being liberated doesn't mean copying what came before but finding one's own way—a way that is genuine to one's own generation.&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards" /&gt;}}

Third-wave feminists used personal narratives as a form of feminist theory. Expressing personal experiences gave women space to recognize that they were not alone in the oppression and discrimination they faced. Using these accounts has benefits because it records personal details that may not be available in traditional historical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=YU|first=SU-LIN|date=October 2011|title=Reclaiming the Personal: Personal Narratives of Third-Wave Feminists|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F00497878.2011.603606|journal=Women's Studies|language=en|volume=40|issue=7|pages=873–889|doi=10.1080/00497878.2011.603606|issn=0049-7878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-wave ideology focused on a more [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardin|first=Marie|author2=Whiteside, Erin|chapter=From Second-Wave to Poststructuralist Feminism|title=The International Encyclopedia of Media Studies: Media Effects/Media Psychology|year=2013|doi=10.1002/9781444361506.wbiems991|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444361506.wbiems991/pdf|publisher=Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-structuralist feminists saw binaries such as male–female as an artificial construct created to maintain the power of the dominant group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Poststructural feminism in education: An overview|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education|year=2000|volume=13|issue=5|pages=477–515|doi=10.1080/09518390050156422|author=Elizabeth Adams St. Pierre}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan W. Scott]] wrote in 1998 that "poststructuralists insist that words and texts have no fixed or intrinsic meanings, that there is no transparent or self-evident relationship between them and either ideas or things, no basic or ultimate correspondence between language and the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Joan W|year=1988|title=Deconstructing Equality-versus-Difference: Or, the Uses of Poststructuralist Theory for Feminism|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=14|issue=1|pages=32–50|jstor=3177997}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Amber Lynn Zimmerman, M. Joan McDermott, and Christina M. Gould wrote in 2009 that third-wave feminism offered five primary focuses: (1) Responsible choice grounded in dialogue; (2) respect and appreciation for experiences and dynamic knowledge; (3) an understanding of "the personal is political" that incorporates both the idea that personal experiences have roots in structural problems and the idea that responsible, individuated personal action has social consequences; (4) use of personal narratives in both theorizing and political activism; (5) political activism as local, with global connections and consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Local is Global: Third Wave Feminism, Peace, and Social Justice|journal=Contemporary Justice Review|volume=12|pages=77|first1=Amber Lynn|last1=Zimmerman|first2=M.

===Relationship with second wave===
[[Amy Richards]] defined the feminist culture for the third wave as "third wave because it's an expression of having grown up with feminism".&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner" /&gt; Second-wave feminists grew up where the politics intertwined within the culture, such as "Kennedy, the Vietnam War, civil rights, and women's rights". In contrast, the third wave sprang from a culture of "punk-rock, hip-hop, 'zines, products, consumerism and the Internet".&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards" /&gt; In an essay entitled "Generations, Academic Feminists in dialogue" [[Diane Elam]] wrote:

{{quote|sign=|source=|"This problem manifests itself when senior feminists insist that junior feminists be good daughters, defending the same kind of feminism their mothers advocated. Questions and criticisms are allowed, but only if they proceed from the approved brand of feminism. Daughters are not allowed to invent new ways of thinking and doing feminism for themselves; feminists' politics should take the same shape that it has always assumed."&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards" /&gt;}}

[[Rebecca Walker]], in ''To Be Real: Telling the Truth and Changing the Face of Feminism'' (1995), wrote about her fear of rejection by her mother ([[Alice Walker]]) and her godmother ([[Gloria Steinem]]) for challenging their views:

{{quote|sign=|source=|"Young Women feminists find themselves watching their speech and tone in their works so as not to upset their elder feminist mothers. There is a definite gap among feminists who consider themselves to be second-wave and those who would label themselves as third-wave. Although, the age criteria for second-wave feminists and third-wave feminists is murky, younger feminists definitely have a hard time proving themselves worthy as feminist scholars and activists."&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt;}}

==Issues==
===Violence against women===
[[File:Vagina Monologues Poster.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The ''[[Vagina Monologues]]'' premiered in New York in 1996.]]
[[Violence against women]], including [[rape]], [[domestic violence]], and [[sexual harassment]], became{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- Where was violence against women not a central issue of feminism? (re: lead of second-wave feminism) --&gt; a central issue. Organizations such as [[V-Day (movement)|V-Day]] formed with the goal of ending gender violence, and artistic expressions, such as ''[[The Vagina Monologues]],'' generated awareness. Third-wave feminists wanted to transform traditional notions of sexuality and embrace "an exploration of women's feelings about sexuality that included vagina-centred topics as diverse as orgasm, birth, and rape".&lt;ref name=Brunell2008&gt;Brunell, Laura (2008).

Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproductive rights===
{{Main article|Reproductive rights}}
One of third-wave feminism's primary goals was to demonstrate that access to contraception and abortion are women's reproductive rights. According to Baumgardner and Richards, "It is not feminism's goal to control any woman's fertility, only to free each woman to control her own."&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards"/&gt; South Dakota's 2006 attempt to ban abortion in all cases, except when necessary to protect the mother's life,&lt;ref name="Davey"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Davey |first=Monica |title=South Dakota Bans Abortion, Setting Up a Battle | newspaper= The New York Times |volume=155 |issue=53511 |pages=A1–A14 |date=7 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the US Supreme Court's vote to uphold the [[partial birth abortion]] ban were viewed as restrictions on women's civil and reproductive rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ludlow | first = Jeannie | title=Sometimes, It's a Child and a Choice: Toward an Embodied Abortion Praxis | journal=[[NWSA Journal]]| volume=20 | issue= 1 | pages=26–50 | date=Spring 2008| oclc=364432908 | jstor=40071251}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Weitz | first1=Tracy A.| last2=Yanow | first2=Susan | title=Implications of the Federal Abortion Ban for Women's Health in the United States| journal=Reproductive Health Matters |volume=16 |issue=31 |pages=99–107 |date=May 2008 | doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(08)31374-3 | pmid=18772090 | oclc=282104847 | jstor=25475407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions on abortion in the US, which was mostly legalized by the 1973 Supreme Court decision in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', were becoming more common in states around the country. These included mandatory waiting periods,&lt;ref&gt;[[Indiana Code]] [http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title16/ar34/ch2.html#IC16-34-2-1.1 Title 16, art.

===Reclaiming derogatory terms===
[[File:Toronto-Slutwalk.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The first [[Slutwalk]], Toronto, 2011]]
English speakers continued to use words such as ''[[spinster]]'', ''bitch'', ''[[whore]]'', and ''[[cunt]]'' to refer to women in derogatory ways. [[Inga Muscio]] wrote, "I posit that we're free to seize a word that was kidnapped and co-opted in a pain-filled, distant past, with a ransom that cost our grandmothers' freedom, children, traditions, pride and land."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Muscio |first=Inga |authorlink=Inga Muscio |title=Cunt: A Declaration of Independence|location=Seattle |publisher=Seal Press |year=1998 |p=9| isbn=978-1-58005-015-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking back the word ''bitch'' was fueled by the single "[[All Women Are Bitches]]" (1994) by the all-woman band [[Fifth Column (band)|Fifth Column]], and by the book ''Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women'' (1999) by [[Elizabeth Wurtzel]].&lt;ref name="Wurtzel 1998"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wurtzel|first=Elizabeth|title=Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women|page=|year=1998|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-385-48400-8|oclc=38144418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The utility of the reclamation strategy became a hot topic with the introduction of [[SlutWalk]]s in 2011. The first took place in Toronto on 3 April that year in response to a Toronto police officer's remark that "women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized."&lt;ref name="slutwalktoronto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/about/why|title=SlutWalk Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional SlutWalks sprang up internationally, including in Berlin, London, New York City, Seattle, and West Hollywood.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slutwalks – Do you agree with the Toronto policeman?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00ggb5t|work=World Have Your Say 60|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several feminist bloggers criticized the campaign; reclamation of the word ''slut'' was questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Meghan|title=We're sluts, not feminists.

=== Sexual liberation ===
Third-wave feminists expanded the second-wave feminists's definition of sexual liberation to "mean a process of first becoming conscious of the ways one's gender identity and sexuality have been shaped by society and then intentionally constructing (and becoming free to express) one's authentic gender identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/feminism/The-third-wave-of-feminism.|title=feminism {{!}} Definition, History, &amp; Examples|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since third-wave feminism relied on different personal definitions to explain feminism, there is controversy surrounding what sexual liberation really entails. Many third-wave feminists supported the idea that women should embrace their sexuality as a way to take back their power.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harnois|first=Catherine|date=Spring 2008|title=Re-Presenting Feminisms: Past, Present, and Future|url=|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other issues===
Third-wave feminism regarded race, social class, and transgender rights as central issues. It also paid attention to workplace matters such as the [[glass ceiling]], unfair [[maternity leave|maternity-leave]] policies,&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal | first = Frank | last=Munden | title=Female medical workers feel maternity leave unfair| journal=The Kapi'o Newspress | volume=36 | issue=28|date= 7 May 2003|url=http://kapio.kcc.hawaii.edu/archive/v36/36_28/nurse.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228075410/http://kapio.kcc.hawaii.edu/archive/v36/36_28/nurse.html| archivedate=28 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; motherhood support for [[single mother]]s by means of [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and [[child care]], respect for working mothers, and the rights of mothers who decide to leave their careers to raise their children full-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=poliscifac|chapter=Women's Leadership and Third-Wave Feminism|last=Iannello|first=Kathleen|editor1-first=Karen|editor1-last=O'Connor|title=Gender and Women's Leadership: A Reference Handbook|publisher=Sage Publishing|year=2010|isbn=1412960835|location=|pages=70–77|quote=|via=The Cupola at Gettysburg College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
===Lack of cohesion===
One issue raised by critics was a lack of cohesion because of the absence of a single cause for third-wave feminism. The first wave fought for and gained the right for women to vote. The second wave fought for the right for women to have access to an equal opportunity in the workforce, as well as the end of legal sex discrimination. The third wave allegedly lacked a cohesive goal and was often seen as an extension of the second wave.&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner" /&gt; Some argued that the third wave could be dubbed the "Second Wave, Part Two" when it came to the politics of feminism and that "only young feminist culture" was "truly third wave".&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards" /&gt; One argument ran that the equation of third-wave feminism with individualism prevented the movement from growing and moving towards political goals. Kathleen P. Iannello wrote:

{{quote|sign=|source=|"The conceptual and real-world 'trap' of choice feminism (between work and home) has led women to challenge each other rather than the patriarchy. Individualism conceived of as 'choice' does not empower women; it silences them and prevents feminism from becoming a political movement and addressing the real issues of distribution of resources."&lt;ref name=Iannello2011&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://rachelyon1.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/third-wave-feminism.pdf|chapter=Third-Wave Feminism and Individualism: Promoting Equality or Reinforcing the Status Quo?|last=Iannello|first=Katherine P.|year=1998|title=Women in Politics: Outsiders or Insiders? A Collection of Readings|editor1-last=Whitaker|editor1-first=Lois Duke|location=Boston, Mass|publisher=Longman}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Objection to "wave construct"===
Feminist scholars such as [[Shira Tarrant]] objected to the "wave construct" because it ignored important progress between the periods. Furthermore, if feminism is a global movement, she argued, the fact that the "first-, second-, and third waves time periods correspond most closely to American feminist developments" raises serious problems about how feminism fails to recognize the history of political issues around the world.&lt;ref name="Tarrant"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tarrant|first=Shira|title=When Sex Became Gender|page=222|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-95347-4|oclc=62281555}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "wave construct" also focused on white women's suffrage and continued to marginalize the issues of women of color and lower-class women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Relationship with women of color===
Third-wave feminists proclaim themselves as the most inclusive wave of feminism. Critics have noted that while progressive, there is still exclusivity of women of color. Black feminists argue that "the women rights movements were not uniquely for the liberation of Blacks or Black Women. Rather, efforts such as women's suffrage and abolition of slavery ultimately uplifted, strengthened, and benefited White society and White women".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marbley|first=Aretha Faye|date=Fall 2005|title=African-American Women's Feelings of Alienation from Third-Wave Feminism: A Conversation with My Sisters|url=|journal=Western Journal of Black Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way to make future waves of feminism more inclusive is to include women of color in the conversation of defining feminism and setting the agenda.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==="Girly" feminism===
Third-wave feminism was often associated, primarily by its critics, with the emergence of so-called "lipstick" or "girly" feminists and the rise of "raunch culture". This was because these new feminists advocated for "expressions of femininity and female sexuality as a challenge to objectification". Accordingly, this included the dismissal of any restriction, whether deemed patriarchal or feminist, to define or control how women or girls should dress, act, or generally express themselves.&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 246"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Jacquetta A.|last2=White|first2=Linda Ann|title=Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Toronto|page=246|edition=2nd|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; These emerging positions stood in stark contrast with the [[Feminist views of pornography|anti-pornography]] strains of feminism prevalent in the 1980s. Second-wave feminism viewed pornography as encouraging violence towards women.&lt;ref name=Iannello2011/&gt; The new feminists posited that the ability to make autonomous choices about self-expression could be an empowering act of resistance, not simply internalized oppression.

Such views were critiqued because of the subjective nature of [[empowerment]] and autonomy. Scholars were unsure whether empowerment was best measured as an "internal feeling of power and agency" or as an external "measure of power and control". Moreover they critiqued an over-investment in "a model of free will and choice" in the marketplace of identities and ideas.{{sfn|Newman|White|2012|p=247}} Regardless, the "girly" feminists attempted to be open to all different selves while maintaining a dialogue about the meaning of identity and femininity in the contemporary world.

Third-wave feminists said that these viewpoints should not be limited by the label "girly" feminism or regarded as simply advocating for "raunch culture". Rather, they sought to be inclusive of the many diverse roles women fulfill. Gender scholars Linda Duits and Liesbet van Zoonen highlighted this inclusivity by looking at the politicization of women's clothing choices and how the "controversial [[sartorial]] choices of girls" and women are constituted in public discourse as "a locus of necessary regulation".&lt;ref name="Newman &amp; White 2012 246"/&gt; Thus the "[[hijab]]" and the "[[Crop top|belly shirt]]", as dress choices, were both identified as requiring regulation but for different reasons. Both caused controversy, while appearing to be opposing forms of self-expression. Through the lens of "girly" feminists, one can view both as symbolic of "political agency and resistance to objectification". The "hijab" could be seen as an act of resistance against Western ambivalence towards Islamic identity, and the "belly shirt" an act of resistance against patriarchal society's narrow views of female sexuality. Both were regarded as valid forms of self-expression.{{sfn|Newman|White|2012|p=247}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7697">A '''transnational feminist network''' (TFN) is a network of women’s groups who work together for women’s rights at both a national and transnational level. They emerged in the mid 1980s as a response to structural adjustment and neoliberal policies, guided by ideas categorized as global feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moghadam|first1=Valentine|title=Globalizing Women: Transnational Feminist Networks|date=January 20, 2005|publisher=JHU Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; TNF's are composed of representatives from a variety of NGO's from around the globe. These representatives then come together at conferences, such as the United Nations World Conference on Women and The NGO Forum in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snyder|first1=Anna|title=TNF's are composed of representatives from a variety of NGO's from around the globe. These representatives then come together at conferences, such as the United Nations World Conference on Women and The NGO Forum in China.|journal=International Journal of Peace Studies|date=2005|volume=10|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Globalization==
TFNs are similar to non-governmental organizations ([[NGO]]s) but while NGOs work at a local and national level, TFNs create coalitions across borders. [[Globalization]] affects women worldwide in adverse ways and TFNs emerged in response to these effects.

According to Johanna Brenner in her article ''Transnational Feminism and the Struggle for Global Justice'':
:“Economic insecurity and impoverishment, exposure to toxics, degradation of water, high infant and maternal mortality rates, forced migration, increased hours spent in paid and unpaid work are only some of the indicates (sic) of women’s burdens worldwide”

Brenner also states that
:“[t]hird world governments are male-dominated, often inefficient, plagued by cronyism, and sometimes corrupt; and the pressures of structural adjustment programs imposed on them by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] have certainly aggravated these tendencies” (Brenner 78).

Programs like Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) are part of the package of globalization that is presented to other countries; and while such programs are portrayed as being valuable to improve the status of a country, they result in creating worse situations for the peoples of a country.

==Aims of TFNs==
Transnational Feminist Networks can be divided into different categories based on their goals. Some of these include Advocacy for Women's Human Rights, Peace, Anti-militarism, Conflict Resolution, Ending Violence Against Women and Reproductive and Health Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moghadam|first1=Valentine|title=Globalizing Women: Transnational Feminism|date=January 20, 2005|publisher=JHU Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to Globalization===
Women’s groups form in response to the negative effects of globalization and TFNs emerge when these women’s groups come together to resolve shared issues. These groups work with one another across borders and they recognize their differences but also discover their similarities and form strong coalition’s bases on these similarities. In describing a conference held by the ''International Network of Women’s Studies Journals'', Tahera Aftab relayed that
:“the objective of the INWSJ conference was to set up a network for interdisciplinary feminist and women’s studies journals with a focus on the development and inclusion of a transnational feminist understanding of women’s development issues…”

Just as these academics worked to reach consensus on issues, so do women’s groups who form TFNs.

Valentine Mogadam best describes TFNs in her book ''Globalizing Women: Transnational Feminist Networks''. She states in her text:
:“TFN’s have arisen in the context of economic, political, and cultural globalization—and they are tackling both the particularistic and the hegemonic trends of globalization. They are advancing criticisms of inequalities and forms of oppression, neoliberal economic policies, unsustainable economic growth and consumption, and patriarchal controls over women. In a word, transnational feminist networks are the organizational expression of the transnational women’s movement, or global feminism” (Moghadam 104).

===Women's Human Rights and Security===
Another widespread aim of transnational feminist networks is to create a stronger sense of global human security while building peace. McKay argues that women and girls perspectives are a necessary component in developing programs and policies. There is a difference in the way men and women experience security and TNF’s have a role in amplifying the women’s perspectives to be acted upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKay|first1=Susan|title=Conflict and Human Security: A Search for New Approaches of Peace-building. "Chapter 7: Women, Human Security and Peace-Building: A Feminist Analysis"|date=2004|publisher=IPSHU English Research Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In specific, Woroniuk states that dimensions of women’s security include “(1) violence against women, (2) gender inequality in control over resources, (3) gender inequality in power and decision making, (4) women’s human rights, and (5) women (and men) as actors, not victims.” These areas are taken into account in TFN’s approach to policy changes and public awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woroniuk|first1=Beth|title=Women’s Empowerment in the context of Human Security: A Discussion Paper|date=1999|location=Bangkok, Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
In 1995 the United Nations held the Fourth World Conference on women that was dedicated towards creating an approach to the marginalization of women. The outcome was a “gendering of the agenda” for other conferences worldwide, which included a focus on gender neutral approaches and prioritizing women’s rights in policy making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Elisabeth|title=Gendering the Agenda: The impact of the transnational women's rights movement at the UN conferences of the 1990s|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|date=2003|volume=26|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TNF’s response to world events can have a strong impact on the actions of governments and societies. An example of such was when the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 1996 and a harsher regime threatened women’s security and rights. Pressure put on governments from feminists around the world resulted in an isolation of the Taliban and an importance placed on Afghan women’s rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moghadam|first1=Valentine|title=Globalizing Women: Transnational Feminist Networks|date=2005|publisher=JHU Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turners''' ({{lang-de|Turner}}) are members of [[German-American]] gymnastic clubs that also served as nationalist political groups that were politically active and often served in German military outfits as well as the [[Union Army]] in the United States during the American Civil War.

A [[Germany|German]] gymnastic movement was started by ''Turnvater'' ("father of gymnastics") [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] in the early 19th century when Germany was occupied by [[Napoleon]]. The ''Turnvereine'' ("gymnastic unions") were not only athletic, but also political, reflecting their origin in similar "nationalistic gymnastic" organizations in Europe. The '''Turner movement''' in Germany was generally [[Liberalism|liberal]] in nature, and many Turners took part in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/rz/turnvere.htm| author=Claire E.

[[File:St-louis-german-turner-shooting-club-medium.jpg|thumb|275px|Group portrait of the St. Louis, Missouri Turnverein in 1860.]]

After its defeat, the movement was suppressed and many Turners left Germany, some emigrating to the [[United States]]. Several of these [[Forty-Eighters]] went on to become Civil War soldiers, the great majority in the [[Union Army]], and American politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Gruen, Mardee. "Milwaukee Turners, local Jews go back 141 years." ''Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle'' April 29, 1994; p. 6, col. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Besides serving as physical education, social, political and cultural organizations for German immigrants, Turners were also active in the American public education and the labor movements.&lt;ref name=Hofmann&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iupui.edu/~hoyt/Hofmann.htm| author=Annette R.

[[File:American Turners stamp, Scott 979.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Postage stamp commemorating the hundredth anniversary of the American Turners]]

The ''Turnvereine'' made a contribution to the integration of German-Americans into their new home. The organizations continue to exist in areas of heavy German immigration, such as [[Iowa]], [[Texas]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[Syracuse, NY]], [[Kentucky]], [[New York City]], and [[Los Angeles]].

Together with [[Carl Schurz]], the American Turners helped support the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as [[President of the United States of America|president of the United States]]. They provided the bodyguard at his inauguration on March 4, 1861, and at his funeral in April 1865. In the [[Camp Jackson Affair]], a large force of German volunteers helped prevent Confederate forces from seizing the government arsenal in [[St. Louis]] just prior to the beginning of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mcwm.org/history_germans.html| author=Scott Williams| title=THE ROLE OF GERMAN IMMIGRANTS IN CIVIL WAR - MISSOURI| publisher=The Missouri Civil War Museum| accessdate=January 10, 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303013738/http://www.mcwm.org/history_germans.html| archivedate=March 3, 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other [[German-American]] groups, the American Turners experienced discrimination during World War I. The German language was banned in schools and universities, and German language journals and newspapers were shut down, but the Turner societies continued to function.&lt;ref name=Hofmann /&gt;

In 1948, the [[United States Post Office|U.S. Post Office]] issued a 3-cent [[commemorative stamp]] marking the 100th anniversary of the movement in the United States.

[[Cultural assimilation]] and the two World Wars with Germany took a gradual toll on membership, with some halls closing and others becoming regular dance halls, bars or bowling alleys.&lt;ref name=LeCompte /&gt; Fifty-four Turner societies still existed around the U.S. as of 2011. The current headquarters of the American Turners is in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.americanturners.com/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx| title=Welcome to American Turners| publisher=American Turners| accessdate=January 9, 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110406032743/http://www.americanturners.com/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx| archivedate=April 6, 2011| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Uniforms of the Italian Armed Forces''' are categorized by the four different branches of the Italian military: the [[Italian Army]], the [[Italian Navy]], the [[Italian Air Force]] and the [[Carabinieri|Carabinieri Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://armedforces.eu/Italy|title=Italy-Army, Navy, Air Force and Carabinieri|last=|first=|date=|website=ArmedForces|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each one of these [[Military|armed forces]] and their subsections have their own [[Uniform|uniforms]]. The style of these historical uniforms can be traced back to the [[Royal Sardinian Army]] in the mid-19th Century, which was the predecessor of the current Italian Armed Forces.&lt;ref name="Historical uniforms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esercito.difesa.it/en/Equipment/Militaria/Uniforms/Pagine/Uniformi-Storiche.aspx|title=Historical uniforms|last=|first=|date=|website=Italian Army|publisher=Ministry of Defence|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The uniforms of the Italian Armed Forces, at first, had symbolic meanings and, later on, became more function and grades based. The [[Expedition of the Thousand|Spedizione dei Mille]] was an event during the war for [[Risorgimento]] (Italian Unification), where [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Giuseppe Garibaldi's]] thousand volunteer troops helped him liberate the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. All of the troops wore red shirts, following the example of Garibaldi's Italian Legion that had fought in the [[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]] in South America. This earned the volunteer troops the nickname, the [[Redshirts (Italy)|Camicie rosse]]. The first historical records of the actual Italian military uniform dates back to the Constitution (called [[Statuto Albertino]]) of the [[Royal Italian Army]] ({{lang-it|Regio Esercito Italiano}}) in 1861, the year of [[Italian Unification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Illustrated-Encyclopaedia-Military-Uniforms-Century/dp/B00FAUOECK/ref=sr_1_77?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1542619437&amp;sr=1-77&amp;keywords=italian+uniforms|title=An Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Military Uniforms of the 19th Century|last=Smith|first=Digby|publisher=LORENZ BOOKS|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=|asin=B00FAUOECK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers of the Royal Army dressed in green colored uniforms with black boots and helmets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Regio esercito: the italian royal army in mussolini's wars, 1935-1943|last=Cloutier|first=Patrick|publisher=lulu.com|year=2013|isbn=9781105074011|location=|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black uniforms of [[Mussolini]]'s militia, the [[Blackshirts|Camicie Nere]], is another symbolic army uniform in Italian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.regioesercito.it/uniformi/unimilizia.htm|title=Regio Esercito-Uniforms of M.V.S.N.-Regulations|last=|first=|date=|website=Regio Esercito|publisher=Ministry of Defence|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duce|Il Duce]] based these black uniforms on the uniforms of the [[Arditi]], a special unit of the Italian Royal Army that fought in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="Arditi"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Italian Arditi: Elite Assault Troops 1917-20|last=Pirocchi|first=Angelo|last2=Vuksic|first2=Velimir|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2004|isbn=9781841766867|location=|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the World Wars, uniforms were prepared and manufactured in military factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sartoriarecchia.it|title=Military factories|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=Sartoria Recchia|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uniforms of WWII"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uniforms of World War II - Over 250 Uniforms of Armies, Navies and Air Forces of the World|last=Darman|first=Peter|publisher=Amber Books|year=2016|isbn=9781782743293|location=|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the voluntary military service for women was started and female uniforms now represent 7% of all Italian military uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.difesa.it/Legislazione/Norme_in_rete/Pagine/urn_nir_parlamento_legge_1999-10-20_380_2003-06-0901_06_2011_15_08_22.aspx|title=LEGGE 20 ottobre 1999 n.380|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Defence|publisher=Gazzetta Ufficiale|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica/mimetica-e-rossetto-lesercito-delle-signore-fa-guerra-ai-1372569.html|title=Mimetica e rossetto.

The '''Italian Navy''' ({{lang-it|Marina Militare}}, abbreviated as '''MM''') is the [[Navy]] of the [[Italy|Italian Republic]]. The Italian Navy is divided into different corps: Corps of Staff Officers ('''SM'''), [[Corps of Naval Engineering]] ('''GN'''), Corps of the Naval Arms ('''AN'''), Maritime Military Medical Corps ('''MD''') for medics and for Pharmacists ('''FM'''), Corps of Military Maritime Commissariat ('''CM'''),  [[Corps of the Port Captaincies – Coast Guard|Corps of the Port Captaincies]] ('''CP'''), Corps of the Military Maritime Crews ('''CEMM''').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Army-Navy-Uniforms-Insignia-Countries/dp/B009KDH2UE|title=Army and Navy Uniforms and Insignia: How to Know Rank, Corps and Service in the Military and Naval Forces of the United States and Foreign Countries|last=Williams|first=Dion|publisher=Ulan Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|page=512|asin=B009KDH2UE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1861, the materials and uniforms used by the Italian Navy have been adjusted and often re-designed as the service evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marina.difesa.it/EN/history/Pagine/default.aspx|title=History and culture|last=|first=|date=|website=Italian Navy|publisher=Ministry of Defence|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Navy 1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.rodorigoeditore.it/prodotto/le-uniformi-della-marina-militare-vol-dal-1861-al-1918/|title=Le Uniformi della Marina Militare – Vol. I, Dal 1861 al 1918|last=Galuppini|first=Gino|publisher=Rodorigo|year=1997|isbn=|location=|page=248|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current uniforms are based on the [[Italian Navy ranks|Marina Militare rank system]], and come with variations in rank and on a seasonal basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uniforms and Insignia of the Navies of World War Two|last=Mollo|first=Andrew|publisher=Greenhill Books|year=1991|isbn=9781853670978|location=|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; This uniforms also vary depending on the the location where the personnel are serving, with different uniforms for serving on ships, naval planes, [[Submarine|submarines]] or land locations.&lt;ref name="Navy uniforms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marina.difesa.it/conosciamoci/uniformi/Pagine/default.aspx|title=Uniforms-Italian Navy|last=|first=|date=|website=Italian Navy|publisher=Ministry of Defence|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Navy 1"/&gt;

===Design===     
The design of the uniforms are based on the rank of the personnel ([[Official|officials]], [[Marshal (Italy)|marshals]], [[Troop|troops]] and [[Cadet|cadets]]).&lt;ref name="Military uniforms from 1861"/&gt; The uniforms change seasonally for summer and winter, and have different uniforms for the different departments of the Navy. The uniforms are also made of different textile materials. There is also an operational uniform that the Navy uses.&lt;ref name="Italian Navy &amp; Air Force Elite Units &amp; Special Forces"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://ospreypublishing.com/italian-navy-air-force-elite-units-special-forces-1940-45|title=Italian Navy &amp; Air Force Elite Units &amp; Special Forces 1940–45|last1=Crociani|first1=Piero|last2=Battistelli|first2=Pier Paolo|date=20 January 2013|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1849088572|location=|page=64|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Navy uniforms"/&gt;

====Regular Uniform====
The standard uniform used by regular troops is the same for male and female personnel, with the exception of the jacket in the winter version (six-buttons for male and a three-buttons for female personnel), and it presents two seasonal variations for summer and winter. The winter uniform is fully colored in a dark-blue, with the same color for its accessories, such as the [[Boonie hat|hat’s brim]] (the hat itself is white on top, with the MM symbol sewn on it), the gloves, shoes and tie. A white shirt is worn underneath. The female personnel are also allowed to carry a bag and substitute the classic cut trousers with a skirt. The summer uniform is composed of a short-sleeved white shirt, worn with another white t-shirt underneath, both of which are tucked into the classical-cut white trousers and tightened by a belt with a golden colored [[buckle]]. The shoes are white, as well as the hat (whose brim remains black like the winter version). As for for the winter version, female personnel can carry a white bag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marina.difesa.it/conosciamoci/uniformi/Pagine/stagione_graduati.aspx|title=Regular uniform-Navy|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Italian Navy|publisher=Ministry of Defence|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ceremonial Uniform====
The ''Ceremonial Uniform'' has two seasonal variations for summer and winter.  There are some common features such as the hat, which remains white on top with a black brim and the Italian Navy symbol sewn on the front; the light blue band passing from the right shoulder and tied to the opposite hip; the black shoes and a [[sword]], the [[hilt]] of which is coloured in gold. The different variations are mainly based on the choice of the color and in the weight of the material used. The summer version is lighter and almost entirely white colored, with black and golden shoulder pads. The winter version comes with a six-button black jacket, classical cut black trousers and a white shirt worn underneath. A black tie completes the uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marina.difesa.it/conosciamoci/uniformi/Pagine/stagioni_ufficiali.aspx|title=Ceremonial uniform-Navy|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Italian Navy|publisher=Ministry of Defence|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Forces===

====GOI====
The Operational Raider Group ({{lang-it|Gruppo Operativo Incursori}}, abbreviated as '''GOI''') is part of the [[Italian special forces|Italian Special Forces]] and is one of the two sections that form the [[Comando Raggruppamento Subacquei e Incursori Teseo Tesei|COMSUBIN]]. The GOI have different uniforms, including a [[scuba diving]] one. After being transported in a submarine, they use diving in order to stealthily reach places while remaining undercover.

====Service Combat Uniform====
The ''Service Combat Uniform'' is the most used uniform, and it is distributed to all soldiers with the same mimetic [[pattern]] ([[Paratrooper|paratroopers]] have a different model with a strengthening on the shoulders). It is composed of a [[beret]], a five button closure jacket with two internal pockets, and trousers with four pockets: two posterior and one in the middle of each thigh.&lt;ref name="Special"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Italian Army Elite Units &amp; Special Forces 1940–43|last=Battistelli|first=Pier Paolo|last2=Shumate|first2=Jhonny|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781849085953|location=|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accessories completing the uniform include gloves, special footwear and a t-shirt with short or long sleeves, depending on the season.

===Historical Uniforms===
Historical uniforms are used in [[Military high school|Military schools]], the [[Military academy|Military Academy]], [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] schools and some [[Regiment|regiments]]. They recall the light blue uniforms of the Savoy army.&lt;ref name="Historical uniforms" /&gt; The Armed Force’s choice of headgear is the [[beret]], used since the 1980s (adapted from the [[side cap]]), and is the most worn headdress by Italian troops.&lt;ref name="Soldier"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/intelligence-report/italian-soldier.html|title=The individual soldier (Italy)|last=US War department|first=|date=December 1942|work=Intelligence bulletin|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each color or model has an historical reason and it also exists in a female version.

====Grey-green====
Italian military troops adopted the ''grey-green uniform'' during the World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Italian Army during World War I|last1=Nicolle|first1=David|publisher=BAM – Biblioteca d’arte militare|year=2014|isbn=9788861021815|edition=Soldati, n. 77|location=|page=90|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Luigi Brioschi, president of the Milanese section of the C.A.I.

====Model 40====
It was possible to update the grey-green uniforms in order to adjust them for [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/arma/ieri/equipaggiamento-e-materiali/1910-1940/le-uniformi/la-riforma-baistrocchi|title=Riforma Baistrocchi|last=Baistrocchi|first=Federico|date=1933|website=Carabinieri|publisher=Ministry of Defence|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Officials, NCOs and troops uniforms differed from each other in the cloth’s quality &amp;nbsp;and workmanship.&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; The Model 40 uniform abolished the colored or black velvet [[Collar (clothing)|collars]].&lt;ref name="Uniforms of WWII" /&gt; Troops had a three-button jacket (known also as a sahariana), which included four patch-pockets with a central pleat closed by small buttons, and it was partially lined.

====Khaki====
During the Italian War of Liberation in 1943, the personnel received [[Khaki drill|khaki]] uniforms from the [[British Army|British Army,]] including a short jacket with a button panel in sight and two large pockets with a button and turn-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tynan |first1=Jane |title=Why First World War soldiers wore khaki |url=http://ww1centenary.oucs.ox.ac.uk/material/why-first-world-war-soldiers-wore-khaki/ |accessdate=20 November 2018 |publisher=WW1 centenary |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trousers had six pockets and they were secured to the ankles through two [[canvas]] buckles.&lt;ref name="Military uniforms from 1861"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.abebooks.it/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=22774989235&amp;cm_mmc=gmc-_-nonisbn-_-PLA-_-v01&amp;product=bi:%2022774989235&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA28nfBRCDARIsANc5BFBK4uzyGqVAkxhfR_g8PpEK-fkENw0R_BlbLDIheIJbyHGQgbQizlwaAueDEALw_wcB|title=Italian Military Uniforms from 1861 until now|last=Del Giudice|first=Elio|last2=Del Giudice|first2=Vittorio|publisher=Bramante|year=2000|isbn=|location=Milan|pages=|language=Italian|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The footwear used were long black boots that came up to the ankle.

===Special Forces===

====Folgore====
On 10 June 1967, the Paratroopers Brigade granted the name “[[Paratroopers Brigade Folgore|Folgore]]” to the Battaglione Paracadutisti, and the beret’s color subsequently changed to [[Amaranth (color)|amaranth]] (a colour adopted by many military departments all over the world).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.folgore.it|title=Folgore-paratroopers and militaria|last=|first=|date=|website=Folgore|publisher=Italian Army (special forces)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:1st Sardinia Grenadiers Bastille Day 2007 n1.jpg|thumbnail|227x227px|Uniform of the first Sardinia Grenadiers|alt=|left]]

In 1997, Col Moschin re-adopted the traditional insignia of the Arditi in the Great War.&lt;ref name="Special" /&gt; It was added to the bomb with a flame on the left, overlapped by two crossed [[Dagger|daggers]], the paratrooper’s [[Parachute|canopy]] and the right wing of the Aviotruppe’s medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esercito.difesa.it/en/equipment/militaria/patches/pagine/infantry-and-specialties-paratroopers.aspx|title=Infantry and specialities-Paratroopers|last=|first=|date=|website=Italian Army|publisher=Ministry of Defence|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Granatieri di Sardegna====
The [[Granatieri di Sardegna Mechanized Brigade|Granatieri di Sardegna]] is one of the oldest regiments in the Italian army. The force originated in [[Sardinia]] is now based in Rome. This corp is responsible for the guarding of the [[President of Italy|president]]. The regiment has its own traditional uniform. The uniform is black with red ornaments and contains a big black hat almost similar to that of the [[Queen's Guard|British Queen's Guard]].&lt;ref name="Special" /&gt;

====Alpini====
The [[Alpini]] are the oldest mountain infantry in the world and one of the Italian special forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1917/12/14/archives/fought-till-death-to-delay-austrians-bersaglieri-and-alpini-in-the.html|title=FOUGHT TILL DEATH TO DELAY AUSTRIANS; Bersaglieri and Alpini in the Mountains|last=Gibbon|first=Perceval|date=14 December 1917|work=New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special feature of their uniform is the ''[[Cappello Alpino]]'', that carries a black [[raven]] feather, a garment that gave this force the nickname: "The Black feathers" ({{lang-it|"Le Penne Nere"}}). Officers traditionally had a white [[eagle]] feather instead of the black one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smalp155.org/curiosita/enciclopedia/cappello-alpino.php|title=Cappello Alpino|last=|first=|date=|website=Small 155|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the force was created, the hat worn was made of black [[felt]]. This was changed when the new green-grey uniform was adopted in 1909. Since then, the hat was changed to the distinctive grey felt that is currently being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vecio.it/cms/index.php/armiequipaggiamento/divise-ed-equipaggiamento|title=Vecio.it - Alpini's history - Uniforms and equipment|last=|first=|date=|website=Vecio|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alpini has distinctive green [[Cuff|cuffs]] on the dark blue tunics worn for full dress and barrack dress before 1915, and by the green piping on their light blue/grey trousers. When grey-green service uniforms were tried out by the Alpini in 1906, before the entire army adopted them in 1909, the distinctive green collar patches and typical headdress were retained and are still in service.

[[File:Italian Air Force uniform.jpg|thumb|365x365px|Historical Italian Air Force Uniform of WWII|alt=]]

===Design===
The uniforms of the '''Italian Air Force''' ({{lang-it|Aeronautica Militare}}, abbreviated as '''AM''') includes a hand-tailored dress [[tunic]] that is made of a medium blue-grey colored [[wool]]. The uniform consists of a buttoned jacket and trousers, with a double buckled belt holding the jacket together to make the appearance of the serviceman more neat and trimmed down. It is worn with a white shirt and a blue or black tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Royal Italian Air Force, 1923-1945|last=Coil|first=Spencer|publisher=Schiffer Pub Ltd|year=2009|isbn=9780764333736|location=|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first planes of the Italian Air Force were not equipped with a closed cabin for the [[Aircraft pilot|pilots]], so earlier versions of the uniforms for pilots included helmets and goggles.&lt;ref name="Uniforms of WWII"/&gt;

The uniform that the [[Gendarmerie]] wore in 1814 consisted of a [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]] fabric buttoned suit with a blue collar and padded gloves.&lt;ref name="Uniforme dei Carabinieri Ministero della Difesa"/&gt; Since 1822, some small changes have been made to the uniform. Officials and Marshals had silver swords and sabers, both in a black leather [[scabbard]]. At the beginning of the 20th Century, the rules of the dress code were reinforced because of World War I.&lt;ref name="Military uniforms from 1861"/&gt; Troops had three different types of uniforms: the ''Complete uniform'', the ''Ordinary uniform'', and the ''Effort uniform''. In 1940, Italy was one of the many countries that fought in World War II. The Carabinieri's uniform at that time was made of a green-grey cloth material, and was used by all soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/arma/ieri/equipaggiamento-e-materiali/1910-1940/le-uniformi/l%27uniforme-di-guerra---1940|title=War uniform - 1940|last=|first=|date=|website=Carabinieri|publisher=Ministry of Defence|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
====Ceremonial Uniform====
For historical and ceremonial use, the Carabinieri uniform consists of a distinctive black uniform made of silver [[Braid|braids]] around the collar and cuffs, edges trimmed in scarlet and [[epaulettes]] in silver. The fringes of the mounted division are white, and the infantry has light blue. The headgear used is the traditional two-pointed hat for Carabinieri, known as the Lucerna, also called a [[bicorne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.relicmilitaria.com/product/italy-italian-carabinieri-lucernabicorne-hatceremonial-headdress-circa-1970s-scarce/|title=Bicorne hat, ceremonial headdress|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Relic Militaria|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Eighties [[Giorgio Armani]] designed the new more modern uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/jul/10/giorgio-armani-80-eight-facts-fashion-designer|title=Giorgio Armani at 80: eight things you didn't know about the fashion designer|last=Cochrane|first=Lauren|date=10 July 2014|work=The Guardian|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regular Uniform====
The modern Carabinieri Force uniform is colored in black for every seasonal version, with small variations on weather basis (coat or wind jacket), and is composed of a four-button jacket with [[Shoulder pads (fashion)|shoulder pads]]: all buttons on the uniform are silvered. The shirt underneath is white, with two pockets. The trousers have a classic cut, with four pockets and has two vertical red stripes along the outer side of both legs, stretching from the hips to the ankles.&lt;ref name="Military uniforms from 1861"/&gt; Flat black shoes are worn. The uniform is accompanied by accessories such as the black tie and, occasionally, black leather gloves. The rigid hat presents the Arma’s frieze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/arma/oggi/uniformi/classificazione|title=Regular uniform-Carabinieri|last=|first=|date=|website=Carabinieri|publisher=Ministry of Defence|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Firenze.Carabinieri01.JPG|thumb|195px|Uniforms of Carabinieri at a manifestation|alt=]]

===Special Forces===
Under the Carabinieri, there are also special police forces in charge with both internal and external security, each with their own uniforms. 

====GIS====
The Carabinieri's section of [[Gruppo di intervento speciale|Special Intervention Group]] ({{lang-it|Gruppo di Intervento Speciale}}, abbreviated as '''GIS''') is an [[Counter-terrorism|anti-terrorism]] unit founded in 1978. The color of the uniform utilized by this élite force is usually the dark blue, even though mimetic and desert variations exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208033140/http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/Italy/GIS.htm|title=GIS|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Special Operations|publisher=Carabinieri|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reinforcements such as helmets, [[Knee pad|knee pads]], [[Elbow pad|elbow pads]] or bulletproof jackets are composed of fireproof and insulating materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/multilingua/en/english/the-nuclei-investigativi-carabinieri-r-o-s-and-g-i-s-|title=THE NUCLEI INVESTIGATIVI, CARABINIERI R.O.S. AND G.I.S.|last=|first=|date=|website=Carabinieri|publisher=Ministry of Defence|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Calabrian and Sardinian Hunters====
[[Carabinieri Helicopter Squadron "Cacciatori di Calabria"|Calabrian and Sardinian Hunters]] ({{lang-it|Cacciatori di Calabria, Cacciatori di Sardegna}})  are one of the special section of support for the Arma dei Carabinieri. Due to the generally milder weather and the rocky features of the southern landscape, the Hunters' uniforms consist of a lighter battle dress with a dark green [[camouflage]] pattern, together with leather gloves and combat boots. Also present with the uniform is a distinctive bright red beret, with the Carabinieri symbol sewn onto it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.difesaonline.it/evidenza/approfondimenti/squadrone-eliportato-carabinieri-cacciatori-di-calabria-al-poligono-di-tiro|title=CARABINIERI SQUADRON.

====Sicilian Hunters====
The [[Carabinieri Helicopter Squadron "Cacciatori di Sicilia"|Sicilian Hunters]] ({{lang-it|Cacciatori di Sicilia}}) are a special paratroop unit of the Carabinieri based in [[Sicilly|Sicily]]. This unit is mainly tasked to search for fugitives in the Sicilian mountains. Besides the normal Carabinieri uniforms, this troop also possesses operational uniforms like the other Hunter squadrons. The operative uniform has an extra blue [[neckerchief]], leather gloves and combat boots.&lt;ref name="AccessoriUniOpCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carabinieri.it/arma/oggi/uniformi/classificazione/accessori-uniforme-operativa|title=Operative uniform's accessories|last=|first=|date=|website=Carabinieri|publisher=Ministry of Defence|language=Italian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Witsand Solar Desalination Plant''' ('''WSDP'''), is a water purification project, under construction in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="2R"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=23 July 2018 |date=18 July 2018 |url=https://www.news24.com/Green/News/revolutionary-solar-power-desalination-plant-could-provide-cheaper-option-but-it-needs-space-20180718 |title=Revolutionary Solar-Power Desalination Plant Could Provide Cheaper Option, but It Needs Space | author=Melanie Gosling | publisher=News24Wire.com |location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="3R"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=23 July 2018 | url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2018-07-16-france-to-help-drought-hit-witsand-with-solar-power-desalination-plant/ |date=16 July 2018 |publisher=[[Business Day (South Africa)]] |
title=France to help drought-hit Witsand with solar-power desalination plant |first=Linda |last=Ensor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The water treatment facility is under construction in the seaside town of [[Witsand]], in [[Hessequa Local Municipality]], in the [[Western Cape|Western Cape Province]], at the mouth of the [[Breede River]].&lt;ref name="2R"/&gt; This is approximately {{convert|305|km|0}}, by road, south-east of [[Cape Town]], the nearest large city.&lt;ref name="4R"&gt;{{cite web|date=23 July 2018 | url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/South_Africa_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Cape%20Town%20City%20Centre%2C%20Cape%20Town%2C%20South%20Africa&amp;toplace=Witsand%2C%20South%20Africa&amp;dt1=ChIJ6U_uo2NnzB0R9eheP_JsUZU&amp;dt2=ChIJ6fOqquJG0R0REXGBzh5BKc0&amp;sr=dc |title=Distance between Cape Town City Centre, Cape Town, South Africa and Witsand, South Africa |access-date=23 July 2018 | author=Globefeed.com |publisher=Globefeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The town of Witsand is a tourist attraction, with a low-season population of approximately 300 people. During the tourist high-season, the population swells to over 3,000 people, leading to freshwater scarcity in the town.To address that scarcity, the government of the Western Cape and the French government, decided to jointly develop and fund he Witsand water purification project.&lt;ref name="2R"/&gt;

==Technology==
The WSDP is the first desalination plant in South Africa, that uses solar energy to power its processes. Its new technology applications, allow for the elimination of storage batteries in the design.&lt;ref name="3R"/&gt; The plant's new '''Osmosun technology''', involves the use of a specialized "intelligent" membrane that is able to continue delivering [[reverse osmosis]], even when the sun goes behind a cloud, thus reducing the amount of solar energy delivered. The energy delivered would increase again when the clouds moved away. That ability to "soften" the variability in the energy delivered, preserves the reverse osmosis membrane. At night, when there is no sun, the design allows the plant to switch to conventional grid-electricity and continue working all through the darkness, until the sun rises the next morning.&lt;ref name="2R"/&gt;

==Construction and cost==
The budgeted cost of the plant is ZAR:8.6 million (approx. US$650,000), to be shared equally between the governments of the Western Cape and that of France.&lt;ref name="1R"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/western-cape/france-co-funds-r86m-desalination-plant-in-western-cape-16055049 | title=France co-funds R8.6 million desalination plant in Western Cape |publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)]] (IOL) |
date=16 July 2018 |access-date=23 July 2018 |last=Ferreira |
first=Emsie |location=South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit cost of the purified water at this plant is between ZAR:7 to ZAR:8 (US$0.52 to US$0.60) for every {{convert|1000|liters|0}}. In comparison, the  temporary diesel-fueled desalination plant at [[Strandfontein, Cape Town|Strandfontein]], in Cape Town, produces potable water at ZAR:35 to ZAR:40 (US$2.62 to US$3.00) for every 1,000 liters. If this project is a success, it might be reproduced in other parts of the country, where drought is a problem.&lt;ref name="2R"/&gt;

==Challenges==
In order to generate enough solar energy for its internal processes, the plant needs {{convert|3.5|ha|acre}} to accommodate the requisite solar panels. This requirement for large areas to install solar panels, may restrict the project's reproducibility in crowded cities like Cape Town.&lt;ref name="2R"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7489">The '''Zeitgeschichtliche Forschungsstelle Ingolstadt e. V.''' (''Ingolstadt Research Institute for Contemporary Historical Research [[Eingetragener Verein|registered association]]'', ''ZFI'', also known as ''Institut für Zeitgeschichtsforschung Ingolstadt'') is a [[Historical revisionism|historical revisionist]] association located in [[Dunsdorf]], [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Anton Maegerle, Daniel Hörsch: ''„Der Kampf um die Köpfe“ hat begonnen. Vordenker, Strategen und Wegbereiter rechter Netzwerke''. In: Stephan Braun, Daniel Hörsch (Hrsg.): ''Rechte Netzwerke, eine Gefahr''. VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, Wiesbaden 2004, {{ISBN|3-8100-4153-X}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political orientation==

The ZFI was founded in 1981 and shaped by [[Alfred Schickel]], [[Hellmut Diwald]] and {{illm|Alfred Seidl|de|Alfred Seidl}}, in opposition to the renowned [[Institut für Zeitgeschichte]] (Institut für Contemporary History) in [[Munich]].&lt;ref name="redok 06-12-14"&gt;[http://www.redok.de/content/view/493/36/ ''Geschichtsrevisionistischer Verein'']. redok, 14 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It has about 500 to 600 members. It organizes large meetings twice a year, and publishes the ''Zeitgeschichtliche Bibliothek'' and the ''ZFI-Informationen''.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Angerstorfer, Annemarie Dengg: ''Rechte Strukturen in Bayern. Eine Dokumentation mit Schwerpunkt Oberbayern, Oberpfalz und Niederbayern.'' Second revised edition, Munich 2005, p.131&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen E. Atkins has stated that the ZFI is a Holocaust denial institution in Germany, while the head of the ZFI, Alfred Schickel, is careful to avoid German restrictions against disputing the Holocaust and has concentrated on what Atkins describes as “so-called [[Allied war crimes during World War II|Allied atrocities]] against the Germans”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Stephen E.|last=Atkins|authorlink=Stephen E. Atkins|title=Holocaust denial as an international movement|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2009|page=105|ISBN=978-0-313-34538-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Schickel wrote in 1980 that the number of six millions Jews killed in the [[Holocaust]] was “no longer advocated seriously today in contemporary historical science”.&lt;ref&gt;“heute in der zeitgeschichtlichen Wissenschaft nicht mehr ernsthaft vertreten”, Alfred Schickel in ''Deutschland in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 1980, cited from: Geschichtsrevisionistischer Verein, ''redok'', 14 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; "The ZFI rejects the findings of historical research, and uses ideologically based [[pseudohistory]]. In doing so, it creates a "parallel universe" isolated from scholarly discourse by self-referencing to its own publications."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Benz  |first1=Wolfgang  |authorlink1=Wolfgang Benz |last2=Reif-Spirek |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Reif-Spirek|title=Geschichtsmythen|publisher=Metropol|year=2003|ISBN=978-3-936411-28-7|pages=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conferences and meetings, [[Nazism|National Socialism]] is trivialized, and the German guilt for the [[Second World War]] is denied. This happens in close collaboration with periodicals such as ''[[Europa Vorn]]'', ''[[Nation und Europa]]'' and ''{{illm|Deutschland in Geschichte und Gegenwart|de|Grabert_Verlag#Geschichte}}'', which pursue similar goals.&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Bernd|author=Wagner|title=Handbuch Rechtsextremismus. Netzwerke, Parteien, Organisationen, Ideologiezentren, Medien|location=Reinbek bei Hamburg|year=1994|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders of ZFI, who except for Schickel have died, have collaborated with historical revisionist and [[Radical right (Europe)|Radical right]] organizations.&lt;ref name="redok 06-12-14"/&gt; Former [[GDR]] policeman {{illm|Bernd Wagner|de|Bernd Wagner (Kriminalist)}} regarded the ZFI in 1994 as "one of the intellectual centers of [[Far right in Germany|far right]] [[historical revisionism]] in Germany".&lt;ref name="Wagner" /&gt;

==Criticism==

The ZFI was previously observed by the intelligence service of the Bavarian government. However, the ZFI no longer features in the yearly reports of the intelligence service, that depict extremist and anti-constitutional activities. In February 2007, the service stated, though, that "Publications belonging to the far right refer to the Head of the ZFI and his articles in order to propagate thoughts which are not compatible with the free democratic order." &lt;ref&gt;„Dagegen propagieren einschlägige rechtsextremistische Publikationen unter Berufung auf die Person des Leiters der ZFI und seine Artikel vereinzelt auch ein mit der freiheitlichen demokratischen Grundordnung nicht vereinbares Gedankengut.“, ''Bayerischer Landtag'', [http://www.bayern.landtag.de/ElanTextAblage_WP15/Drucksachen/Schriftliche%20Anfragen/15_0007335.pdf Drucksache 15/7335], 22 February 2007, Answer to a written inquiry by the deputy Florian Ritter, [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and others have made allegations that {{illm|Alfred Lehmann|de|Alfred_Lehmann_(Politiker,_1950)}} ([[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]), Lord Mayor of Ingolstadt, has participated several times in  ZFI conferences, while [[Horst Seehofer]] (CSU), the minister for food, agriculture and consumer protection, had sent a laudatory greeting to the organization.&lt;ref name="redok 06-12-14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SPD-Pressestelle: [http://www.spd-landtag.de/aktuell/presse_anzeigen.cfm?mehr=7135 ''SPD-Rechtspolitiker Florian Ritter sieht Zeitgeschichtliche Forschungsstelle Ingolstadt (ZFI) im Zwielicht''], 22 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the more active critics of the institution include the left-wing journalist [[Anton Maegerle]], who published his portrait of the ZFI in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnr.de/content/kaempfer-fuer-eine-neue-zeitgeschichte Kämpfer für eine neue Zeitgeschichte] in Blick nach Rechts 29.05.1996&lt;/ref&gt; Its publications are widely considered to be of [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] nature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Wippermann]]:''Verdiente Revisionisten. Alfred Schickel und die "Zeitgeschichtliche Forschungsstelle Ingolstadt (ZFI)"''. In: Johannes Klotz, Ulrich Schneider (eds.): ''Die selbstbewußte Nation und ihr Geschichtsbild.'' Köln 1997, {{ISBN|3-89438-137-X}}, pp. 78-95.&lt;/ref&gt;
