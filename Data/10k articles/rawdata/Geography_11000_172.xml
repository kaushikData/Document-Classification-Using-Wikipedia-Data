'''The Baptist College, Stepney''', was opened in [[Stepney]] in the East End of London in 1810 by the [[Particular Baptists]]. Its buildings included rooms for tutors and students, a refectory, a library and a chapel. The college relocated to larger premises at [[Holford House]] in 1856 and became [[Regent's Park College, Oxford|Regent's Park College]].&lt;ref name="Dissenting Academies"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dissacad.english.qmul.ac.uk/sample1.php?*detail=achist&amp;histid=25&amp;acadid=183|title=Baptist College, Stepney (1810-1856) and Regent's Park College, London (1856-1927)|publisher=dissacad.english.qmul.ac.uk|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only remaining structure is the largely-destroyed Baptist Academical Institution chapel. The building remained until it was damaged during [[World War 2]]; only three parts of the college estate remain.&lt;ref name="WinfieldNigel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Winfield|first=Nigel|title=Stepping Stones: Community Farm Project in Stepney, East London|year=1986|publisher=British Association of Settlements and Social Action Centres|location=UK|isbn=0950345253|pages=32}}2&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is currently part of the [[Stepney City Farm]].  [[Crossrail]] works are taking place there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://74f85f59f39b887b696f-ab656259048fb93837ecc0ecbcf0c557.r23.cf3.rackcdn.com/assets/library/document/0/original/0003-r-stepneygreen.pdf Structures at King John Street, Stepney Green, London E1 (Stepney College and Stepney Meeting, or Congregational Church)] Museum of London Archaeology Service&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bukovinian Subcarpathians''' ({{lang-ro|Subcarpaţii Bucovinei}}, ''Obcinele Bucovinei'') is a geographic area in the NNE of [[Romania]] ([[Suceava County]]) and SWW of [[Ukraine]] ([[Chernivtsi Oblast]]), situated to the east and north-east of the [[Eastern Carpathian Mountains]]. It is a subunit of the [[Carpathian Foothills]].

Bucovinian Subcarpathians are bounded by the [[Suceava Plateau]] on the low side, and the [[Carpathian Mountains]] on the upper side.

It consists of:
* Great Ridge (''Obcina Mare'')
* Feredeu Ridge (''Obcina Feredeu'')
* [[Obcina Mestecăniș Mountains]] (''Obcina Mestecăniș'')

[[File:Claudius Ptolemy- The World.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A medieval depiction of the [[Ecumene]] (1482, Johannes Schnitzer, engraver), constructed after the coordinates in Ptolemy's [[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]] and using his second map projection. The translation into Latin and dissemination of ''Geography'' in Europe, in the beginning of the 15th century, marked the rebirth of scientific cartography, after more than a millennium of stagnation.]]

'''Cartography''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑːr|ˈ|t|ɒ|g|r|ə|f|i}}; from [[Greek language|Greek]] χάρτης ''chartēs'', "papyrus, sheet of paper, map"; and γράφειν ''graphein'', "write") is the study and practice of making [[map]]s. Combining [[science]], [[aesthetics]], and technique, cartography builds on the premise that reality can be modeled in ways that communicate spatial information effectively.

The fundamental problems of traditional cartography are to:
* Set the map's agenda and select traits of the object to be mapped. This is the concern of map editing. Traits may be physical, such as roads or land masses, or may be abstract, such as [[Toponomy|toponyms]] or political boundaries.
* Represent the terrain of the mapped object on flat media. This is the concern of [[map projection]]s.
* Eliminate characteristics of the mapped object that are not relevant to the map's purpose. This is the concern of [[Cartographic generalization|generalization]].
* Reduce the complexity of the characteristics that will be mapped. This is also the concern of generalization.
* Orchestrate the elements of the map to best convey its message to its audience. This is the concern of [[#Map design|map design]].

Modern cartography constitutes many theoretical and practical foundations of [[geographic information system]]s.

===Ancient times===
What is the earliest known map is a matter of some debate, both because the term "map" is not well-defined and because some artifacts that might be maps might actually be something else. A wall painting that might depict the ancient Anatolian city of [[Çatalhöyük]] (previously known as Catal Huyuk or Çatal Hüyük) has been dated to the late 7th millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Tale of two obsessed archeologists, one ancient city, and nagging doubts about whether science can ever hope to reveal the past |author=Robert Kunzig |journal=Discover Magazine |date=May 1999 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1999/may/archeologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A bird's eye view – of a leopard's spots.

In [[ancient China]], geographical literature dates to the 5th century BCE. The oldest extant Chinese maps come from the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]], dated back to the 4th century BCE, during the [[Warring States period]].

The [[Geography in medieval Islam|Arab geographer]] [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] produced his medieval atlas ''[[Tabula Rogeriana]] (Book of Roger)'' in 1154. By combining the knowledge of [[Africa]], the [[Indian Ocean]], [[Europe]], and the [[Far East]] (which he learned through contemporary accounts from Arab merchants and explorers) with the information he inherited from the classical geographers, he was able to write detailed descriptions of a multitude of countries. Along with the substantial text he had written, he created a world map influenced mostly by the Ptolemaic conception of the world, but with significant influence from multiple Arab geographers. It remained the most accurate world map for the next three centuries.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;S. P.

As part of this work, a smaller, circular map was made depicting the south on top and Arabia in the center. Al-Idrisi also made an estimate of the circumference of the world, accurate to within 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parry|first=James|date=01/2004|title=Mapping Arabia|url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200401/mapping.arabia.htm|journal=Saudi Aramco World|volume=55|pages=20–37|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Age of Exploration]], from the 15th century to the 17th century, European cartographers both copied earlier maps (some of which had been passed down for centuries) and drew their own, based on explorers' observations and new [[surveying]] techniques. The invention of the [[magnetic compass]], [[telescope]] and [[sextant]] enabled increasing accuracy. In 1492, [[Martin Behaim]], a German cartographer, made the oldest extant globe of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/guide/gmillgtm.html Globes and Terrain Models – Geography and Maps: An Illustrated Guide], Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1507, [[Martin Waldseemüller]] produced a globular world map and a large 12-panel world wall map (''[[Universalis Cosmographia]]'') bearing the first use of the name "America". [[Portugal|Portuguese]] cartographer [[Diego Ribero]] was the author of the first known planisphere with a graduated Equator (1527). [[Italy|Italian]] cartographer [[Battista Agnese]] produced at least 71 manuscript atlases of sea charts. [[Johannes Werner]] refined and promoted the [[Werner projection]]. This was an equal-area, heart-shaped world map projection (generally called a cordiform projection) which was used in the 16th and 17th centuries. Over time, other iterations of this map type arose; most notable are the [[sinusoidal projection]] and the [[Bonne projection]]. The Werner projection places its standard parallel at the North Pole; a sinusoidal projection places its standard parallel at the equator; and the Bonne projection is intermediate between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Bottomley, « Between the Sinusoidal projection and the Werner: an alternative to the Bonne », ''Cybergeo : European Journal of Geography'' [Online], Cartography, Images, GIS, document 241, Online since 13 June 2003, connection on 27 July 2018.

In 1569, mapmaker [[Gerardus Mercator]] first published [[Mercator 1569 world map|a map based on his Mercator projection]], which uses equally-spaced parallel vertical lines of longitude and parallel latitude lines spaced farther apart as they get farther away from the equator. By this construction, courses of constant bearing are conveniently represented as straight lines for navigation. The same property limits its value as a general-purpose world map because regions are shown as increasingly larger than they actually are the further from the equator they are. Mercator is also credited as the first to use the word "atlas" to describe a collection of maps. In the later years of his life, Mercator resolved to create his Atlas, a book filled with many maps of different regions of the world, as well as a chronological history of the world from the Earth's creation by God until 1568. He was unable to complete it to his satisfaction before he died. Still, some additions were made to the Atlas after his death and new editions were published after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Mercator-projection|title=Mercator Projection|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=01-25-2018|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gerardus-Mercator|title=Gerardus Mercator|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=02-26-2018|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern times===
Due to the sheer physical difficulties inherent in cartography, map-makers frequently lifted material from earlier works without giving credit to the original cartographer. For example, one of the most famous early maps of North America is unofficially known as the "Beaver Map", published in 1715 by [[Herman Moll]]. This map is an exact reproduction of a 1698 work by [[Nicolas de Fer]]. De Fer in turn had copied images that were first printed in books by [[Louis Hennepin]], published in 1697, and [[François Du Creux]], in 1664. By the 18th century, map-makers started to give credit to the original engraver by printing the phrase "After [the original cartographer]" on the work.&lt;ref&gt;"Map Imitation" in [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/forgery/002035-3000-e.html Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological changes==
[[File:Fernão Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|right|A pre-Mercator nautical chart of 1571, from Portuguese cartographer [[Fernão Vaz Dourado]] (c. 1520–c. 1580).

[[File:Structureforet.jpg|thumb|right|Mapping can be done with [[GPS]] and [[laser rangefinder]] directly in the field. Image shows mapping of forest structure (position of trees, dead wood and canopy).]]

In cartography, technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users. The first maps were produced manually, with brushes and parchment; so they varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of magnetic devices, such as the [[compass]] and much later, [[magnetic storage]] devices, allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to [[digital mapping|store and manipulate them digitally]].

Advances in mechanical devices such as the [[printing press]], [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and [[vernier scale|vernier]], allowed the mass production of maps and the creation of accurate reproductions from more accurate data. [[Hartmann Schedel]] was one of the first cartographers to use the printing press to make maps more widely available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-12-29|title=Hartmann Schedel|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hartmann_Schedel&amp;oldid=817640765|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optical technology, such as the [[telescope]], [[sextant]] and other devices that use telescopes, allowed accurate land surveys and allowed mapmakers and navigators to find their [[latitude]] by measuring angles to the [[North Star]] at night or the Sun at noon.

Advances in photochemical technology, such as the [[lithography|lithographic]] and [[photography|photochemical processes]], make possible maps with fine details, which do not distort in shape and which resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving, which further speeded up map production.

In the 20th century, [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and [[remote sensing]] provided efficient, precise methods for mapping physical features, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and topography. The United States Geological Survey has devised multiple new map projections, notably the Space Oblique Mercator for interpreting satellite [[ground track]]s for mapping the surface. The use of satellites and space telescopes now allows researchers to map other planets and moons in outer space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp1395|title=Map projections: A Working Manual|last=Snyder|first=John|date=1987|website=United States Geological Survey|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in electronic technology ushered in another revolution in cartography: ready availability of [[Computer hardware|computers and peripherals]] such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also [[digital raster graphic]].

These days most commercial-quality maps are made using [[software]] of three main types: [[computer-aided design|CAD]], [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and specialized illustration [[software]]. Spatial information can be stored in a [[database]], from which it can be extracted on demand. These tools lead to increasingly dynamic, interactive maps that can be manipulated digitally.

[[rugged computer|Field-rugged computers]], [[GPS]], and [[laser rangefinder]]s make it possible to create maps directly from measurements made on site.

==Deconstruction==

There are technical and cultural aspects to producing maps. In this sense, maps can sometimes be said to be biased. The study of bias, influence, and agenda in making a map is what comprise a map's [[deconstruction]]. A central tenet of deconstructionism is that maps have power. Other assertions are that maps are inherently biased and that we search for metaphor and rhetoric in maps.&lt;ref name=Harley/&gt;

It is claimed that the Europeans promoted an "[[epistemology|epistemological]]" understanding of the map as early as the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Harley&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008/--deconstructing-the-map?rgn=main;view=fulltext Harley, J. B. (1989). "Deconstructing the Map". Cartographica, Vol. 26, No. 2. pp 1-5]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this understanding is that "[&lt;nowiki /&gt;European reproduction of terrain on maps] reality can be expressed in mathematical terms; that systematic observation and measurement offer the only route to cartographic truth…".&lt;ref name=Harley/&gt; 17th century map-makers were careful and precise in their strategic approaches to maps based on a scientific model of knowledge. Popular belief at the time was that this scientific approach to cartography was immune to the social atmosphere.{{Fix|text=gobbledegook}}

A common belief is that science heads in a direction of progress, and thus leads to more accurate representations of maps. In this belief European maps must be superior to others, which necessarily employed different map-making skills. "There was a 'not cartography' land where lurked an army of inaccurate, heretical, subjective, valuative, and ideologically distorted images. Cartographers developed a 'sense of the other' in relation to nonconforming maps."&lt;ref name=Harley/&gt;

Although cartography has been a target of much criticism in recent decades, a cartographer's 'black box' always seemed to be naturally defended to the point where it overcame the criticism. However, to later scholars in the field, it was evident that cultural influences dominate map-making.&lt;ref name=Harley/&gt; For instance, certain abstracts on maps and the map-making society itself describe the social influences on the production of maps. This social play on cartographic knowledge "…produces the 'order' of [&lt;nowiki /&gt;maps'] features and the 'hierarchies of its practices.'"&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences. A Translation of Les mots et les choses. New York: Vintage Books, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Fix|text=incomprehensible waffle}}

Depictions of Africa are a common target of [[deconstructionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Jeffrey C. (1988). "Imperialism, Colonialism and Cartography". Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, N.S. 13. Pp 57.&lt;/ref&gt; According to deconstructionist models, cartography was used for strategic purposes associated with imperialism and as instruments and representations of power&lt;ref name="Basset"&gt;Bassett, J. T. (1994). "Cartography and Empire Building in the Nineteenth-Century West Africa". Geographical Review, Vol. 84, No. 3. Pp 316.&lt;/ref&gt; during the conquest of Africa. The depiction of Africa and the low latitudes in general on the [[Mercator projection]] has been interpreted as imperialistic and as symbolic of subjugation due to the diminished proportions of those regions compared to higher latitudes where the European powers were concentrated.&lt;ref name="Monmonier"&gt;Monmonier, Mark (2004). ''Rhumb Lines and Map Wars: A Social History of the Mercator Projection'' p. 152. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. (Thorough treatment of the social history of the Mercator projection and Gall–Peters projections.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Maps furthered imperialism and colonization of Africa in practical ways by showing basic information like roads, terrain, natural resources, settlements, and communities. Through this, maps made European commerce in Africa possible by showing potential commercial routes, and made natural resource extraction possible by depicting locations of resources. Such maps also enabled military conquests and made them more efficient, and imperial nations further used them to put their conquests on display. These same maps were then used to cement territorial claims, such as at the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–1885.&lt;ref name="Basset" /&gt;

Before 1749, maps of the African continent had African kingdoms drawn with assumed or contrived boundaries, with unknown or unexplored areas having drawings of animals, imaginary physical geographic features, and descriptive texts. In 1748, Jean B. B. d'Anville created the first map of the African continent that had blank spaces to represent the unknown territory.&lt;ref name="Basset" /&gt; This was revolutionary in cartography and the representation of power associated with map making.

==Map types==

===General vs. thematic cartography===
[[File:Orienteringskort bygholm 2005 detail.jpg|thumb|Small section of an orienteering map.]]
[[File:Easter Island map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map of [[Easter Island]].]]
[[File:Maps-for-free Sierra Nevada.png|thumb|Relief map [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]]]

In understanding basic maps, the field of cartography can be divided into two general categories: general cartography and thematic cartography. General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000 (replacing the older 1&amp;nbsp;inch to 1 mile) "[[Ordnance Survey]]" maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail. Many private mapping companies have also produced thematic map series.

[[Thematic map|Thematic cartography]] involves maps of specific geographic themes, oriented toward specific audiences. A couple of examples might be a [[Thematic map#Dot|dot map]] showing corn production in Indiana or a shaded area map of Ohio counties, divided into numerical [[Choropleth map|choropleth]] classes. As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.

A third type of map is known as an "orienteering," or special purpose map. This type of map falls somewhere between thematic and general maps. They combine general map elements with thematic attributes in order to design a map with a specific audience in mind. Oftentimes, the type of audience an orienteering map is made for is in a particular industry or occupation. An example of this kind of map would be a municipal utility map.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/1848|title=Cartography and Visualization Part I: Types of Maps|last=Dutton|first=John|date=|website=Penn State University E-Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topographic vs. topological===
A [[topographic map]] is primarily concerned with the [[topography|topographic]] description of a place, including (especially in the 20th and 21st centuries) the use of [[contour line]]s showing elevation. [[Terrain]] or relief can be shown in a variety of ways (see [[Cartographic relief depiction]]). In the present era, one of the most widespread and advanced methods used to form topographic maps is to use computer software to generate digital elevation models which show shaded relief. Before such software existed, cartographers had to draw shaded relief by hand. One cartographer who is respected as a master of hand-drawn shaded relief is the Swiss professor Eduard Imhof whose efforts in hill shading were so influential that his method became used around the world despite it being so labor-intensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennelly|first=Patrick|date=2006|title=A Uniform Sky Illumination Model to Enhance Shading of Terrain and Urban Areas|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1559/152304006777323118|journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science|volume=33|pages=21–36|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icaci.org/eduard-imhof-1895-1986/|title=Eduard Imhof (1895–1986)|last=Ormeling|first=F.J.|date=12/31/1986|website=International Cartographic Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[topological map]] is a very general type of map, the kind one might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. [[Harry Beck|Beck's]] [[Tube map|London Underground map]] is an iconic example. Although the most widely used map of "The Tube," it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the [[River Thames]], letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ovenden|2007|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfils its purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Devlin, Keith |title=The Millennium Problems |location=New York, New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2002 |pages=162–163 |isbn=978-0-465-01730-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Map design==
[[File:Livingston-Greenwich-map.jpg|thumb|right|Illustrated map.]]

===Map purpose and selection of information===
[[Arthur H. Robinson]], an American cartographer influential in thematic cartography, stated that a map not properly designed "will be a cartographic failure." He also claimed, when considering all aspects of cartography, that "map design is perhaps the most complex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, A.H. |title=Elements of Cartography |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1953 |isbn=0-471-72805-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson codified the mapmaker's understanding that a map must be designed foremost with consideration to the audience and its needs.

From the very beginning of mapmaking, maps "have been made for some particular purpose or set of purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, A.H. |title=Early Thematic Mapping: In the History of Cartography |location=Chicago |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=1982 |isbn=0-226-72285-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the map should be illustrated in a manner in which the percipient acknowledges its purpose in a timely fashion. The term ''percipient'' refers to the person receiving information and was coined by Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Alan MacEachren|MacEachren, A.M.]] |title=How Maps Work |location=New York |publisher=The Guilford Press |year=1995 |isbn=1-57230-040-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of [[Figure-ground in map design|figure-ground]] refers to this notion of engaging the user by presenting a clear presentation, leaving no confusion concerning the purpose of the map. This will enhance the user's experience and keep their attention. If the user is unable to identify what is being demonstrated in a reasonable fashion, the map may be regarded as useless.

Making a meaningful map is the ultimate goal. [[Alan MacEachren]] explains that a well designed map "is convincing because it implies authenticity" (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;9). An interesting map will no doubt engage a reader. Information richness or a map that is multivariate shows relationships within the map. Showing several variables allows comparison, which adds to the meaningfulness of the map. This also generates hypothesis and stimulates ideas and perhaps further research. In order to convey the message of the map, the creator must design it in a manner which will aid the reader in the overall understanding of its purpose. The title of a map may provide the "needed link" necessary for communicating that message, but the overall design of the map fosters the manner in which the reader interprets it (Monmonier, 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;93).

In the 21st century it is possible to find a map of virtually anything from the inner workings of the [[human body]] to the [[virtual world]]s of [[cyberspace]]. Therefore, there are now a huge variety of different styles and types of map – for example, one area which has evolved a specific and recognisable variation are those used by [[public transport]] organisations to guide [[passenger]]s, namely [[urban rail and metro maps]], many of which are loosely based on 45 degree angles as originally perfected by [[Harry Beck]] and [[George Dow]].

===Naming conventions===
{{main|Toponymy|Cartographic labeling}}
Most maps use text to [[Labeling (map design)|label]] places and for such things as the map title, legend and other information. Although maps are often made in one specific language, place names often differ between languages. So a map made in English may use the name ''Germany'' for that country, while a German map would use ''Deutschland'' and a French map ''Allemagne''. A non-native term for a place is referred to as an [[exonym]].

In some cases the correct name is not clear. For example, the nation of Burma officially changed its name to [[Myanmar]], but many nations do not recognize the ruling junta and continue to use ''Burma''. Sometimes an official name change is resisted in other languages and the older name may remain in common use. Examples include the use of ''Saigon'' for [[Ho Chi Minh City]], ''Bangkok'' for [[Bangkok|Krung Thep]] and ''Ivory Coast'' for [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]].

Difficulties arise when [[transliteration]] or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] between [[writing system]]s is required. Some well-known places have well-established names in other languages and writing systems, such as ''Russia'' or ''Rußland'' for Росси́я, but in other cases a system of transliteration or transcription is required. Even in the former case, the exclusive use of an exonym may be unhelpful for the map user. It will not be much use for an English user of a map of Italy to show Livorno ''only'' as "Leghorn" when road signs and railway timetables show it as "Livorno". In transliteration, the characters in one script are represented by characters in another. For example, the [[Cyrillic]] letter ''Р'' is usually written as ''R'' in the [[Latin script]], although in many cases it is not as simple as a one-for-one equivalence. Systems exist for transliteration of [[Arabic script|Arabic]], but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukhā, Mocca and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is now usually converted to the Latin alphabet through the [[Pinyin]] phonetic transcription systems. Other systems were used in the past, such as [[Wade-Giles]], resulting in the city being spelled ''Beijing'' on newer English maps and ''Peking'' on older ones.

Further difficulties arise when countries, especially former colonies, do not have a strong national geographic naming standard. In such cases, cartographers may have to choose between various phonetic spellings of local names versus older imposed, sometimes resented, colonial names. Some countries have multiple official languages, resulting in multiple official placenames. For example, the capital of Belgium is both ''Brussel'' and ''Bruxelles''. In Canada, English and French are official languages and places have names in both languages. [[British Columbia]] is also officially named ''la Colombie-Britannique''. English maps rarely show the French names outside of Quebec, which itself is spelled ''Québec'' in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Illustrated Atlas of the World |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |year=1992 |isbn=0-528-83492-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of placenames is called [[toponymy]], while that of the origin and historical usage of placenames as words is [[etymology]].

In order to improve legibility or to aid the illiterate, some maps have been produced using pictograms to represent places. The iconic example of this practice is [[Lance Wyman]]'s early plans for the [[Mexico City Metro]], on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos. Wyman also prototyped such a map for the [[Washington Metro]], though ultimately the idea was rejected. Other cities experimenting with such maps are [[Fukuoka]], [[Guadalajara]] and [[Monterrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ovenden|2007|pages=60, 131, 132, 135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Map symbology===
Cartographic [[symbology]] encodes information on the map in ways intended to convey information to the map reader efficiently, taking into consideration the limited space on the map, models of human understanding through visual means, and the likely cultural background and education of the map reader. Symbology may be implicit, using universal elements of design, or may be more specific to cartography or even to the map.

A map may have any of many kinds of symbolization. Some examples are:
* A [[#Map key or legend|legend, or key]], explains the map's pictorial language.
* A title indicates the region and perhaps the theme that the map portrays.
* A neatline frames the entire map image.
* A [[compass rose]] or north arrow provides orientation.
* An overview map gives global context for the primary map.
* A [[bar scale]] translates between map measurements and real distances.
* A map projection provides a way to represent the curved surface on the plane of the map.

The map may declare its sources, accuracy, publication date and authorship, and so forth. The map image itself portrays the region.

[[Map coloring]] is another form of symbology, one whose importance can reach beyond aesthetic. In complex thematic maps, for example, the color scheme's structure can critically affect the reader's ability to understand the map's information. Modern computer displays and print technologies can reproduce much of the [[gamut]] that humans can perceive, allowing for intricate exploitation of human visual discrimination in order to convey detailed information.

Quantitative symbols give a visual indication of the magnitude of the phenomenon that the symbol represents. Two major classes of symbols are used to portray quantity. Proportional symbols change size according to phenomenon's magnitude, making them appropriate for representing statistics. [[Choropleth map]]s portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of the color is evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration.

====Map key or legend====
[[File:Legenda Michelin kaart 1940.jpg|thumb|Legend or key of a Belgian road map (Michelin 1940)]]

The map key, or legend, describes how to interpret the map's symbols and may give details of publication and authorship.

===Map generalization===
{{main|Cartographic generalization}}
A good map has to compromise between portraying the items of interest (or [[thematic map|themes]]) in the right place on the map, and the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a ''slightly'' incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space ''on the ground''. A good example from the late 1980s was the [[Ordnance Survey]]'s first digital maps, where the ''absolute'' positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of metres away from [[ground truth]], when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.

===Map projections===
{{main|Map projection}}

The Earth being spherical, any flat representation generates distortions such that shapes and areas cannot both be conserved simultaneously, and distances can never all be preserved.&lt;ref name="Albrecht 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/lectures/lec6concepts/map%20coordinate%20systems/how%20to%20choose%20a%20projection.htm|last=Albrecht|first=Jochen|series=[http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/201syllabusSp05.htm Introduction to Mapping Sciences, 2005]|title=Maps projections|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mapmaker must choose a suitable ''map projection'' according to the space to be mapped and the purpose of the map.

==Cartographic errors==
Some maps contain deliberate errors or distortions, either as [[Cartographic propaganda|propaganda]] or as a "[[watermark]]" to help the copyright owner identify infringement if the error appears in competitors' maps. The latter often come in the form of nonexistent, misnamed, or misspelled "[[trap streets]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Monmonier | first = Mark | title = How to Lie with Maps | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-226-53421-9 | page = 51 |editor=2nd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names and forms for this are [[paper townsite]]s, [[fictitious entry|fictitious entries]], and copyright [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Copyright_Easter_Eggs Openstreetmap.org Copyright Easter Eggs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another motive for deliberate errors is cartographic "vandalism": a mapmaker wishing to leave his or her mark on the work. Mount Richard, for example, was a fictitious peak on the [[Rocky Mountains]]' [[continental divide]] that appeared on a [[Boulder County, Colorado]] map in the early 1970s. It is believed to be the work of draftsman Richard Ciacci. The fiction was not discovered until two years later.

[[Sandy Island (New Caledonia)]] is an example of a fictitious location that stubbornly survives, reappearing on new maps copied from older maps while being deleted from other new editions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1824">'''Clement Lemprière''' (1683-1746) was an artist, military draughtsman and cartographer.

==Life==
The eldest son of Thomas Lempriere and Joan or Jeanne Beach, he was born in [[St Helier]] on [[Jersey]] and baptised in the Town Church on 18 January 1683. He was a captain, though it is unclear if this was a military, naval or merchant naval rank - his obituary in the ''[[Gentlemen's Magazine]]'' called him "captain of a marching regiment", but Thieme calls him "by profession a ship's captain". He made sketches in Scotland, Portugal, Bermuda and the [[Balearics]], which were posthumously published.&lt;ref&gt;George Balleine, ''[https://www.theislandwiki.org/index.php/Clement_Lempriere_(1683-1746) A Biographical Dictionary of Jersey]'', 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1725 he created an official map of roads in the Scottish Highlands. In 1727 he was made a draughtsman to the [[Ordnance Office]]'s Civil Branch, with an annual salary of £100 and an office in the [[Tower of London]] - he held that post until his death and his pupils included [[Leonard Smelt]]. He also published engravings after his own paintings of warships and a map of Bermuda. His portrait was engraved by [[John Faber Junior]] after [[William Fry (engraver)|William Fry]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp50713/clement-lempriere&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor '''David Leslie Linton''' (12 July 1906 &amp;ndash; 11 April 1971), British geographer and geomorphologist, was professor of geography at [[University of Sheffield|Sheffield]] and [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]], best remembered for his work on the landscape development of south-east England with [[Sidney William Wooldridge|S. W. Wooldridge]], and on the development of [[Tor (rock formation)|tors]].

==Early life and education==
David Linton was born in 1906 in [[New Cross]], London, the second of three children of  parents from northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=goudie&gt;{{cite web |author=Andrew S. Goudie|title=Linton, David Leslie (1906–1971)|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/67421|accessdate=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the nearby [[Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham College|Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham School]] and [[King's College London]]. He received  a first class general honours degree in chemistry, physics, and geology in 1926 and a first class special honours degree in geography in 1927.&lt;ref name=kcl&gt;{{cite web |title=LINTON, Professor David Leslie (1906-1971) | url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/iss/archives/collect/10li50-1.html |publisher=King's College London Archives Services|year=2000|accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
On graduation Linton initially worked at King's as demonstrator in geology, taking over from  [[Sidney William Wooldridge|S.W.Wooldridge]] (later the first professor of geography at King's), who had recently completed his doctorate. In 1929 Linton moved to [[Edinburgh University]]. He nevertheless continued to collaborate with Wooldridge on a number of publications on the geology and geomorphology of south-east England during the 1930s, culminating in ''Structure, Surface and Drainage in South-east England'' (1939, republished 1955).

During [[World War II]] Linton carried out [[photo reconnaissance]] with the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]], later publishing ''The Interpretation of Air Photographs'' (1947). Following the war he was appointed professor of geography at [[Sheffield University]] in 1945. In 1958 he became professor at [[Birmingham University]], where he remained until his death in 1971.

Much of his published post-war work was on the geomorphology of Scotland, including a series of papers on [[river capture]]. He identified the importance of glacial breaching of main watersheds (divides), and recognised that this process had been more intense in the west, with glacial dissection of the mountains declining eastwards (although his synthesis of this was published posthumously by Keith Clayton, see Publications). Concerned with denudation chronology (the reconstruction of long-term landform history), he became involved with study of the origin of [[Tor (rock formation)|tors]] in Scotland, on [[Dartmoor]], the [[Pennines]] and [[South Africa]]. His view was that the British tors were a product of deep chemical weathering under a tropical climate in the [[Tertiary]], exposed by erosion in the [[Pleistocene]]. This contrasted sharply with the views of others that tors are essentially arctic features produced by [[periglacial]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;French, H.M. (1976), ''The Periglacial environment'', London: Longman, {{ISBN|0-582-48079-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of his wider view of the importance of pre-glacial events and forms. However his attribution of the prevailing eastward flow of the major rivers of Scotland to emergence and tilted uplift of a fresh chalk seabed in the early Tertiary was dismissed in the PhD studies of French geomorphologist Alain Godard (later Professor at Paris).&lt;ref&gt;Jarman D (2007): Alain Godard on the NW Highlands of Scotland: present relevance for long-term landscape evolution studies. Géomorphologie, 177-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting in Sheffield (with Wooldridge and others) in 1958, he was a founder member of what became the [[British Geomorphological Research Group]],&lt;ref name=bsg1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geomorphology.org.uk/pages/about/history/ |title=History of the BSG |publisher=British Society for Geomorphology |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate=2008-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820001049/http://www.geomorphology.org.uk/pages/about/history/ |archivedate=20 August 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which he chaired in 1961.

Linton was honorary editor of ''Geography'' (1947–1965) and president of section E of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] (1957), the [[Institute of British Geographers]] (1962) and the [[Geographical Association]] (1964).

==Personal life==
Linton married Vera Tebbs in 1929. They had three sons and a daughter. He was a devoted family man, an able artist and musician. Though shy he was highly regarded as a lecturer and writer. He could be arrogant and disinclined to accept opposition, but was also capable of kindness. He died of cancer at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]], [[Edgbaston]], [[Birmingham]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=goudie /&gt;

==Legacy==
Like Wooldridge, Linton was a fieldworker whose approach has been superseded by the study of processes and quantitative analysis. Their major work on the development of south-east England has been shown to be based on too simplistic a view of tectonic history. It nonetheless remains as an enduring monument to one of the most distinctive phases of British geomorphology.&lt;ref name=goudie /&gt;

The David Linton Award of the British Society for Geomorphology (which incorporates the British Geomorphological Research Group) is given to a geomorphologist who has made a leading contribution to the discipline over a sustained period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geomorphology.org.uk/pages/awards/ |title=Awards |publisher=British Society for Geomorphology |date=31 July 2007 |accessdate=2008-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225084727/http://www.geomorphology.org.uk/pages/awards/ |archivedate=25 February 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among many notable recipients have been [[Ralph A.

'''Dimictic lakes''' mix from the surface to bottom twice each year. Dimictic lakes are [[holomictic]], a category which includes all lakes which mix one or more times per year. During winter, they are covered by ice. During summer, they are thermally stratified, with temperature-derived density differences separating the warm surface waters (the [[epilimnion]]), from the colder bottom waters (the [[hypolimnion]]). 
[[Image:LSE Stratification.png|thumb|300px|left|Typical mixing pattern for a [[dimictic]] lake]]
{{clearleft}}
Mixing (overturning) typically occurs during the spring and autumn, when the lake is "isothermal" (i.e. at the same temperature from the top to the bottom). At this time, the water throughout the lake is about 4&amp;nbsp;°C, and, in the absence of any temperature or density differences, the lake readily mixes from top to bottom. These lakes are common in regions with temperate climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1139/f83-207 | last = Lewis | first = William M., Jr. | year = 1983 | title = A revised classification of lakes based on mixing | journal = Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences | volume = 40 | issue = 10 | pages = 1779–1787 | url = http://cires.colorado.edu/limnology/pubs/pdfs/Pub058.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090306140542/http://cires.colorado.edu/limnology/pubs/pdfs/Pub058.pdf | archivedate = 2009-03-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Downhill mountain biking|mountain biking]] and [[alpine skiing|skiing]], a '''fall line''' refers to the line down a [[mountain]] or [[hill]] which is most directly downhill. That is, the direction a ball would accelerate if it were free to move on the slope under [[gravity]]. In mountain biking, a [[Single track (mountain biking)|trail]] follows the "fall line" if it generally descends in the most downward direction, rather than traversing in a sideways direction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rootsrated.com/brevard-nc/mountain-biking/farlow-gap https://rootsrated.com] Farlow Gap - Mountain Biking: fall line (2nd paragraph) — "The trail becomes loose and rocky, and becomes fall line into a wide open rock garden..."&lt;/ref&gt; A skier is said to be "skiing the fall line" if he or she is moving generally down, making turns either side of the fall line, rather than moving across the slope. Mathematically the fall line, the [[line of greatest slope]], is the negative of the [[gradient]] (which points uphill) and perpendicular to the [[contour line]]s.

The '''geography of the Netherlands''' in [[Europe]] is unusual in that much of its land has been reclaimed from the sea and is below [[sea level]], protected by [[dike (construction)|dikes]]. Another factor that has influenced its physical appearance is that the country is among the most densely populated on Earth. It is [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density|ranked 30th]]&lt;!--excluding dependent territories, but including Aruba and Sint Maarten which have the same status ("country") as the Netherlands--&gt; overall on that scale, but is behind only three countries having a population over 16 million. Consequently, the [[Netherlands]] is highly urbanized.

== Statistics ==
'''Geographic coordinates''': 5.45°E and 50.30°N 

The Dutch RD coordinate system (''Rijksdriehoeksmeting'') is also in common use; see [https://rdinfo.kadaster.nl/pdf/rd_brochure.pdf] (pdf, in Dutch; see little map on p.&amp;nbsp;1) and [https://web.archive.org/web/20050121103434/http://web.inter.nl.net/users/F.Kissels/gps/conversie.html converter]. There is a west-east coordinate between 0 and 280&amp;nbsp;km, and a south-north coordinate between 300 and 620&amp;nbsp;km.

The reference point is the ''Onze-Lieve-Vrouwentoren'' (Our Lady's Tower) in [[Amersfoort]], with RD coordinates (155.000, 463.000) and geographic coordinates approximately {{coord|52|9|N|5|23|E|}}.

==Landscape==

The European part of the country can be split into two areas: the low and flat lands in the west and north, and the higher lands with minor hills in the east and south. The former, including the reclaimed [[polder]]s and [[river delta]]s, make up about half of its surface area and are less than {{convert|1|m|ft}} above sea level, much of it actually below sea level. An extensive range of [[seawall]]s and coastal [[dune]]s protect the Netherlands from the sea, and levees and dikes along the rivers protect against river flooding. The rest of the country is mostly flat; only in the extreme south of the country does the land rise to any significant extent, in the foothills of the [[Ardennes]] mountains. This is where [[Vaalserberg]] is located, the highest point on the European part of the Netherlands at {{convert|322.7|m|ft}}&lt;!-- good reason for [[using Template:convert]] --&gt; above sea level. The highest point of the entire country is [[Mount Scenery]] (887 metres or 2,910 ft), which is located outside the European part of the Netherlands, on the island of [[Saba]]. The Netherlands is located at mouths of three major European rivers ([[Rhine]], [[Meuse (river)|Maas]] or Meuse, and [[Scheldt]]).

In November 2016, the Netherlands and [[Belgium]] agreed to cede small, uninhabited parcels of land to reflect a change in course of the river [[Meuse]] (or Maas, in Dutch). The land swap is to take effect as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/belgium-and-the-netherlands-agree-to-swap-land-to-restore-border|title=Belgium and Netherlands agree to swap land to simplify border|last=Reuters|date=2016-11-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3393">The '''geology of Eritrea''' in east [[Africa]] broadly consists of [[Precambrian]] rocks in the west, [[Paleozoic]] glacial sedimentary rocks in the South and [[Cenozoic]] [[sedimentary rocks|sediments]] and [[volcanic rocks|volcanics]] along the coastal zone adjoining the [[Red Sea]]. The Precambrian rocks been involved with the orogeny process, which is when a section of the Earth's crust is deformed to form a mountain range. Mesozoic sediments in the [[Danakil Alps|Danakil]] and Aysha horsts, which are raised blocks of the Earth's crust that have been lifted, were deformed.&lt;ref name= "geoatlas" /&gt; The older rocks include [[metamorphic rocks|meta-sediments]] and older [[gneiss]]ic [[basement (geology)|basement]] belonging to different [[Proterozoic]] [[terrane]]s. [[Mesozoic]] sediments of marine origin occur in the coastal area along the Red Sea. A number of thin [[Miocene]] age [[basalt]] flows occur within the sediments of this zone whilst the basalts of the [[Aden Series]] date from [[Pliocene]] to [[Holocene]] times, some being extruded at the time of a major phase of uplift and rifting during the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eisourcebook.org/1419_Geology.html|title=Eritrea, geology Extractive Industries Source Book|access-date=October 19, 2016|website=Extractive Industries|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130704003945/http://www.eisourcebook.org/1419_Geology.html|archivedate=July 4, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eisourcebook.org/cms/Jan%202013/Eritrea,%20Simplified%20Geological%20Map.jpg|title=Eritrea, geological map Extractive Industries Source Book|website=Extractive Industries|access-date=October 19, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304140153/http://www.eisourcebook.org/cms/Jan%202013/Eritrea%2C%20Simplified%20Geological%20Map.jpg|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hispaniola''' ({{lang-es|La Española}}; [[Latin language|Latin]] and {{lang-fr|Hispaniola}}; {{lang-ht|Ispayola}}; {{lang-tnq|Haiti}})&lt;ref name="anghiera"/&gt;&lt;ref name="casas"/&gt; is an island in the [[Caribbean]] [[island group]] known as the [[Greater Antilles]]. It is the second largest island in the [[Caribbean]] after [[Cuba]], and the most populous island in the Caribbean; it is also the eleventh [[List of islands by population|most populous island]] in the world.

The {{convert|76192|km2|adj=on}} island is divided between two separate, sovereign nations: the Spanish-speaking [[Dominican Republic]] (48,445&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 18,705 sq mi) to the east, and French Creole-speaking [[Haiti]] (27,750&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 10,710 sq mi) to the west. The only other shared island in the Caribbean is [[Saint Martin (island)|Saint Martin]], which is shared between [[France]] ([[Collectivity of Saint-Martin|Saint-Martin]]) and [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] ([[Sint Maarten]]).

Hispaniola is the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas, founded by [[Christopher Columbus]] on his voyages in 1492 and 1493.&lt;ref name=embassy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domrep.org/gen_info.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524150608/http://www.domrep.org/gen_info.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 24, 2007 |title=Embassy of the Dominican Republic, in the United States |accessdate=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html |title=Haiti |work=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===

The island was called by various names by its native people, the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]]. No known [[Taíno language|Taíno texts]] exist, hence, historical evidence for those names comes to us through three European [[historian]]s: the Italian [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera|Pietro Martyr d‘Anghiera]], and the Spaniards [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] and [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés|Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo]]. Fernández de Oviedo and de las Casas both recorded that the island was called ''Quizqueia'' (supposedly "Mother of all Lands") by the Taíno. D'Anghiera added another name, ''Haiti'' ("Mountainous Land"), but later research shows that the word does not seem to derive from the original [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]] Taíno language.&lt;ref name="anghiera"&gt;{{cite book| last = Anglería| first =  Pedro Mártir de| title = Décadas del Nuevo Mundo, Tercera Década, Libro&amp;nbsp;VII| publisher = Editorial Bajel| year = 1949| location = Buenos Aires| language = Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Quisqueya'' is today mostly used in the [[Dominican Republic]].) Although the Taínos' use of ''Quizqueia'' is verified, and the name was used by all three historians, evidence suggests that it probably was the Taíno name of the whole island, and for a region (now known as ''[[Los Haitises National Park|Los Haitises]]'') in the northeastern section of the present-day Dominican Republic.

When Columbus took possession of the island in 1492, he named it ''Insula [[Hispania|Hispana]]'' in [[Latin]]&lt;ref&gt;"Quam protinus Hispanam dixi": [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/columbus.html Epistola De Insulis Nuper Repertis] (Letter to Lord Raphael Sanchez, March 14, 1493).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''La Isla Española'' in Spanish,&lt;ref name=McIntosh&gt;{{cite book |title=The Piri Reis Map of 1513 |first=Gregory C |last=McIntosh |publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8203-2157-8 |page=88 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgRXuOWah7MC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=Hispaniola+Espa%C3%B1ola}}&lt;/ref&gt; with both meaning "the Spanish island". De las Casas shortened the name to "Española", and when d‘Anghiera detailed his account of the island in [[Latin]], he rendered its name as ''Hispaniola''.&lt;ref name=McIntosh/&gt; In the oldest documented map of the island, created by Andrés de Morales, Los Haitises is labeled ''Montes de Haití'' ("Haiti Mountains"), and de las Casas apparently named the whole island Haiti on the basis of that particular region,&lt;ref name="casas"&gt;{{cite book| last = Las Casas| first =  Fray Bartolomé de| title = Apologética Histórica Sumaria| publisher = UNAM| year = 1966| location = Mexico| language = Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; as d'Anghiera states that the name of one part was given to the whole island.&lt;ref name="anghiera" /&gt;

Due to Taíno, Spanish and French influences on the island, historically the whole island was often referred to as ''Haiti,'' ''Hayti,'' ''Santo Domingo,'' ''St. Domingue,'' or ''San Domingo.'' The colonial terms ''[[Saint-Domingue]]'' and ''[[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]]'' are sometimes still applied to the whole island, though these names refer, respectively, to the colonies that became Haiti and the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Albert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hL2JlqVLuP4C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=names+of+hispaniola&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0srHDtycs8&amp;sig=aYjtKeSsFWQVsDKfCG_atFNDIS4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rNkqVYj-LI33yQTd04HgAg&amp;ved=0CGYQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=names%20of%20hispaniola&amp;f=false |title=The Butterflies of Hispaniola |page=10 |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-8130-0902-5 |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Anghiera's literary work was translated into [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] soon after being written, the name Hispaniola became the most frequently used term in English-speaking countries for the island in scientific and cartographic works. In 1918, the United States occupation government, led by [[Harry Shepard Knapp]], obliged the use of the name Hispaniola on the island, and recommended the use of that name to the [[National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Castillo Pantaleón|first1=Juan Miguel|title=La Nacionalidad Dominicana|date=2012|publisher=Editora Nacional, Ministerio de Cultura|location=Santo Domingo|isbn=978-9945-469-97-4|page=329|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcJBAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA328|accessdate=15 June 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Haïti'' was adopted by Haitian revolutionary [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] in 1804, as the official name of independent Saint-Domingue, as a tribute to the Amerindian predecessors. It was also adopted as the official name of independent Santo Domingo, as the ''[[Republic of Spanish Haiti]],'' a state that existed from November 1821 until its annexation by Haiti in February 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=conflict_haiti_dominican|title=The Conflict Between Haiti and the Dominican Republic|last=Lancer|first=Jalisco|date=|website=www.allempires.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flag"&gt;{{cite web | title = Haiti – Historical Flags | work = Flags of the World | url = http://www.flag.de/FOTW/flags/ht-hist.html#span | accessdate = 2007-12-24 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050505041710/http://www.flag.de/FOTW/flags/ht-hist.html#span | archivedate = May 5, 2005 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-Columbian ===
&lt;br /&gt;The primary indigenous group on the island of Hispaniola was the Arawak/Taino people.&lt;ref name="Poole"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poole|first=Robert|date=2011|title=What Became of the Taíno?|url=http://proxy.library.georgetown.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/897718111?accountid=11091|journal=Smithsonian|volume=70|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arawak tribe originated in the [[Orinoco Delta]], spreading from Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Poole" /&gt; They travelled to Hispaniola around 1200 CE.&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Noble David|date=2005|title=Taino (Arawak) Indians|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?resultListType=RELATED_DOCUMENT&amp;userGroupName=wash43584&amp;inPS=true&amp;contentSegment=9780028659923&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;isETOC=true&amp;docId=GALE&amp;#124;CX3434600333|journal=Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity|volume=3|pages=|via=GVRL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each society on the island was a small independent kingdom with a lead known as a [[cacique]].&lt;ref name="Corbett"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/43a/100.html|title=The History of Haiti|last=Corbett|first=Bob|date=1995|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1492, which is considered the peak of the Taino, there were five different kingdoms on the island,&lt;ref name="Poole" /&gt; the Xaragua, Higuey (Caizcimu), Magua (Huhabo), Ciguayos (Cayabo or Maguana), and Marien (Bainoa).&lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt; Many distinct Taino languages also existed in this time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berman|first=Mary|date=2008|title=The Greater Antilles and Bahamas|url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/estarch/the_greater_antilles_and_bahamas/0|journal=Encyclopedia of Archaeology|volume=|pages=|via=Credo}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still heated debate over the population of Taino people on the island of Hispaniola in 1492, but estimates range upwards ofThe 750,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=21st Century Anthropology: A Reference Handbook|last=Holguín|first=|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2010|isbn=- 9781412957380|location=Thousand Oaks, CA, USA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Arawak/Taino home consisted of a circular building with woven straw and palm leaves as covering.&lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt; Most individuals slept in fashioned hammocks, but grass beds were also used.&lt;ref name="Poole" /&gt; The cacique lived in a different structure with larger rectangular walls and a porch.&lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt; The Taino village also had a flat court used for ball games and festivals.&lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt; Religiously, the Arawak/Taino people were polytheists, and their gods were called zemí.&lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt; Religious worship and dancing were common, and medicine men or priests also consulted the zemí for advise in public ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt; For food, the Arawak/Taino relied on meat and fish as a primary source for protein;&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt; some small mammals on the island were hunted such as rats, but ducks, turtles, snakes, and bats as a common food source.&lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt; The Taino also relied on agriculture as a primary food source.&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt; The indigenous people of Hispaniola raised crops in a conuco, which is a large mound packed with leaves and fixed crops to prevent erosion.&lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt; Some common agricultural goods were [[cassava]], maize, squash, beans, peppers, peanuts, cotton, and tobacco, which was used as an aspect of social life and religious ceremonies. &lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt;  

The Arawak/Taino people travelled often and used hollowed canoes with paddles when on the water for fishing or for migration purposes,&lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt; and upwards of 100 people could fit into a single canoe.&lt;ref name="Poole" /&gt; The Taino came in contact with the Caribs, another indigenous tribe, often.&lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt; The caribs lived mostly in modern day Puerto Rico and northeast Hispaniola and were known to be hostile towards other tribes.&lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt; The Arawak/Taino people had to defend themselves using bow and arrows with poisoned tips and some war clubs.&lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt; When Columbus landed on Hispaniola, many Taino leaders wanted protection from the Caribs.&lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt;

===Post-Columbian===
[[File:Columbus landing on Hispaniola adj.jpg|thumbnail|left|Columbus landing on Hispaniola]]

[[Christopher Columbus]] inadvertently landed on the island during his first voyage across the Atlantic in 1492, where his flagship, the ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa Maria]]'', sank after running aground on December 25. A contingent of men were left at an outpost christened [[La Navidad]], on the north coast of present-day Puerto Plata. On his return the following year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/articles/some-facts-about-christopher-columbus.html|title=What Are Some Facts About Christopher Columbus?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the destruction of La Navidad by the local population, Columbus quickly established a second compound farther east in present-day [[Dominican Republic]], [[La Isabela]].

The island was inhabited by the [[Taíno people|Taíno]], one of the indigenous [[Arawak peoples]]. The Taino were at first tolerant of Columbus and his crew, and helped him to construct [[La Navidad]] on what is now [[Môle-Saint-Nicolas]], Haiti, in December 1492. European colonization of the island began in earnest the following year, when 1,300 men arrived from [[Spain]] under the watch of [[Bartolomeo Columbus]]. In 1496, the town of ''Nueva Isabela'' was founded. After being destroyed by a [[hurricane]], it was rebuilt on the opposite side of the Ozama River and called [[Santo Domingo]]. It is the oldest permanent European settlement in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/526|title=Colonial City of Santo Domingo|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish believed Africans would be more capable of performing physical labor. From 1519 to 1533, the indigenous uprising known as Enriquillo's Revolt ensued, resulting from escaped African slaves on the island possibly working with the Taino people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ldhi.library.cofc.edu/exhibits/show/african_laborers_for_a_new_emp/early_trans_atlantic_slave_tra|title=The Early Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade: Nicolas Ovando · African Laborers for a New Empire: Iberia, Slavery, and the Atlantic World  · Lowcountry Digital History Initiative|website=ldhi.library.cofc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher Columbus brought sugar cane on his second voyage to the island. Molasses was the chief product. Diego Colon's plantation had 40 African slaves in 1522. By 1526, 19 mills were in operation from Azua to Santo Domingo.&lt;ref name=Floyd/&gt;{{rp|224}}

In 1574, a census taken of the Greater Antilles reported 1,000 Spaniards and 12,000 African slaves on Hispaniola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Morison |first = Samuel Eliot |authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison |coauthors = |title = The Oxford History of the American People |publisher = [[Mentor]] |year = 1972 |location = New York City |page = 71 |isbn = 0-451-62600-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Spain conquered new regions on the mainland of the Americas ([[Spanish Main]]), its interest in Hispaniola waned, and the colony’s population grew slowly. By the early 17th century, the island and its smaller neighbors (notably [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]]) became regular stopping points for [[Piracy in the Caribbean|Caribbean pirates]]. In 1606, the government of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] ordered all inhabitants of Hispaniola to move close to Santo Domingo, to avoid interaction with pirates. Rather than secure the island, his action meant that French, English and Dutch pirates established their own bases on the abandoned north and west coasts of the island.

[[File:Map of Hispaniola.JPG|thumb|300px|French map of Hispaniola by Nicolas de Fer]]
In 1665, French colonization of the island was officially recognized by [[Louis XIV|King Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV]]. The French colony was given the name [[Saint-Domingue]]. In the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], Spain formally ceded the western third of the island to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266962/Hispaniola |title=Hispaniola Article |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cardiostart.org/blog/ |title=Dominican Republic 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint-Domingue quickly came to overshadow the east in both [[wealth]] and [[population]]. Nicknamed the "Pearl of the Antilles," it became the richest and most prosperous colony in the [[West Indies]], with a system of human enslavement used to grow and harvest sugar cane, during a time when demand for sugar was high in Europe. Slavery kept prices low and profit was maximized at the expense of human lives. It was an important port in the Americas for goods and products flowing to and from France and Europe.

With the treaty of [[Peace of Basel]], revolutionary France emerged as a major European power. In the second 1795 Treaty of Basel (July 22), Spain ceded the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, later to become the Dominican Republic. French settlers had begun to colonize some areas in the Spanish side of the territory.

European colonists often died young due to tropical fevers, as well as from violent slave resistance in the late eighteenth century.

Thousands of the French troops sent by Napoleon to reestablish slavery succumbed to [[yellow fever]] during the summer months, and more than half of the French army died because of disease.&lt;ref name=Bollet_2004&gt;{{cite book | last= Bollet | first= A.J. |  title= Plagues and Poxes: The Impact of Human History on Epidemic Disease | pages=48–49 | publisher= Demos Medical Publishing | year= 2004 | isbn = 1-888799-79-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the French removed the surviving 7,000 troops in late 1803, the leaders of the revolution declared western Hispaniola the new nation of independent Haiti in early 1804. France continued to rule Spanish Santo Domingo. In 1805, Haitian troops of General [[Henri Christophe]] tried to conquer all of Hispaniola. They invaded Santo Domingo and sacked the towns of Santiago de los Caballeros and Moca, killing most of their residents, but news of a French fleet sailing towards Haiti forced General Christophe to return to Haiti, leaving the eastern Spanish side of the island in French hands. In 1808, following Napoleon's invasion of Spain, the [[Criollo people|criollos]] of Santo Domingo revolted against French rule and, with the aid of the United Kingdom (Spain's ally) returned Santo Domingo to Spanish control.

Fearing the influence of a society that had successfully fought and won against their enslavers, the United States and European powers refused to recognize Haiti, the second republic in the western hemisphere. France demanded a high payment for compensation to slaveholders who lost their property, and Haiti was saddled with unmanageable debt for decades.&lt;ref name="natural"&gt;Diamond, Jared M. and Robinson, James A.

==Geography==
{{see also|Geography of Haiti|Geography of the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:Hispaniola lrg.jpg|thumb|300px|Topographic map of Hispaniola]]
Hispaniola is the second-largest island in the [[Caribbean]] (after [[Cuba]]), with an area of {{convert|76192|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, {{convert|48440|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/dr.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which is under the sovereignty of the [[Dominican Republic]] occupying the eastern portion and {{convert|27750|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; under the sovereignty of [[Haiti]] occupying the western portion.

The island of Cuba lies {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} to the northwest across the [[Windward Passage]]; 190&amp;nbsp;km to the southwest lies [[Jamaica]], separated by the [[Jamaica Channel]]. [[Puerto Rico]] lies 130&amp;nbsp;km east of Hispaniola across the [[Mona Passage]]. [[The Bahamas]] and [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] lie to the north. Its westernmost point is known as Cap Carcasse.

Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico are collectively known as the [[Greater Antilles]].

The island has five major mountain ranges: The Central Range, known in the Dominican Republic as the ''[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]]'', spans the central part of the island, extending from the south coast of the Dominican Republic into northwestern Haiti, where it is known as the ''Massif du Nord''. This mountain range boasts the highest peak in the Antilles, [[Pico Duarte]] at {{convert|3098|m|ft|sp=us}} above [[sea level]]. The ''[[Cordillera Septentrional]]'' runs parallel to the Central Range across the northern end of the Dominican Republic, extending into the Atlantic Ocean as the [[Samaná Peninsula]]. The ''Cordillera Central'' and ''Cordillera Septentrional'' are separated by the lowlands of the [[Cibao|Cibao Valley]] and the Atlantic coastal plains, which extend westward into Haiti as the ''Plaine du Nord'' (Northern Plain). The lowest of the ranges is the ''Cordillera Oriental'', in the eastern part of the country.&lt;ref name="Bowin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowin|first1=Carl|editor1-last=Nairn|editor1-first=Alan|editor2-last=Stehli|editor2-first=Francis|title=The Geology of Hispaniola, in The Ocean Basins and Margins|date=1975|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media, LLC|location=New York|isbn=9781468485370|page=503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sierra de Neiba'' rises in the southwest of the Dominican Republic, and continues northwest into Haiti, parallel to the ''Cordillera Central'', as the ''Montagnes Noires'', ''Chaîne des Matheux'' and the ''Montagnes du Trou d'Eau''. ''The Plateau Central'' lies between the ''[[Massif du Nord]]'' and the ''[[Montagnes Noires, Haiti|Montagnes Noires]]'', and the ''Plaine de l‘Artibonite'' lies between the ''Montagnes Noires'' and the ''Chaîne des Matheux'', opening westward toward the [[Gulf of Gonâve]], the largest gulf of the Antilles.&lt;ref name=Bowin/&gt;

The southern range begins in the southwestern most Dominican Republic as the [[Baoruco Mountain Range|Sierra de Bahoruco]], and extends west into Haiti as the [[Massif de la Selle]] and the [[Massif de la Hotte]], which form the mountainous spine of Haiti’s southern peninsula. [[Pic la Selle|Pic de la Selle]] is the highest peak in the southern range, the third highest peak in the Antilles and consequently the highest point in Haiti, at {{convert|2680|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level. A [[Depression (geology)|depression]] runs parallel to the southern range, between the southern range and the ''Chaîne des Matheux''-''Sierra de Neiba''. It is known as the ''[[Plaine du Cul-de-Sac]]'' in Haiti, and Haiti’s capital [[Port-au-Prince]] lies at its western end. The depression is home to a chain of [[salt lake]]s, including [[Etang Saumâtre|Lake Azuei]] in Haiti and [[Lake Enriquillo]] in the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref name=Bowin/&gt;

The island has four distinct [[ecoregion]]s. The [[Hispaniolan moist forests]] ecoregion covers approximately 50% of the island, especially the northern and eastern portions, predominantly in the lowlands but extending up to {{convert|2100|m|ft|sp=us}} elevation. The [[Hispaniolan dry forests]] ecoregion occupies approximately 20% of the island, lying in the [[rain shadow]] of the mountains in the southern and western portion of the island and in the [[Cibao]] valley in the center-north of the island. The [[Hispaniolan pine forests]] occupy the mountainous 15% of the island, above {{convert|850|m|ft}} elevation. The [[flooded grasslands and savannas]] ecoregion in the south central region of the island surrounds a chain of lakes and lagoons in which the most notable include that of [[Etang Saumatre|Lake Azuei]] and [[Trou Caïman]] in Haiti and the nearby [[Lake Enriquillo]] in the Dominican Republic.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

===Fauna===
There are many [[List of birds of Hispaniola|bird species in Hispaniola]], and [[List of amphibians of Hispaniola|the island's amphibian species]] are also diverse. Numerous land species on the island are endangered and could become extinct. There are many species endemic to the island including insects and other invertebrates, reptiles, and mammals. The most famous endemic mammal on the island is the Hispaniola Hutia (Plagiodontia aedium). There are also many avian species on the island. The six endemic genera are Calyptophilus, Dulus, Nesoctites, Phaenicophilus, Xenoligea and Microligea. More than half of the original ecoregion has been lost to habitat destruction impacting the local fauna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/nt0305|title=The island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean  {{!}} Ecoregions {{!}} WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haiti deforestation.jpg|thumbnail|235x235px|right|Satellite image depicting the border between [[Haiti]] (left) and the [[Dominican Republic]] (right)]]

In Haiti, [[Deforestation in Haiti|deforestation]] has long been cited by scientists as a source of ecological crisis; the timber industry dates back to French colonial rule.

Haiti has seen a dramatic reduction of forests due to the excessive and increasing use of [[charcoal]] as fuel for cooking. Recent in-depth studies of satellite imagery and environmental analysis regarding forest classification conclude an accurate estimate of approximately 30% tree cover,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.envirosociety.org/2016/05/haiti-is-covered-with-trees/ |title=Haiti is Covered with Trees |website=EnviroSociety|publisher=Tarter, Andrew|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a stark decrease in the 60% [[forest cover]] in 1925. Despite recent in-depth studies, the notoriously unsubstantiated 2% forest cover estimate has been widely circulated in media and in discourse concerning the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/story/one-of-the-most-repeated-facts-about-deforestation-in-haiti-is-a-lie |title=One of the Most Repeated Facts about Haiti is a Lie |editor=O'Connor, M. R. |date=13 October 2016 |publisher=Vice News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the drastic underestimation of Haiti's forest cover, the country has been significantly deforested over the last 50 years, resulting in the desertification of portions of the Haitian territory.

In the [[Dominican Republic]] the forest cover has increased. In 2003 the Dominican forest cover had been reduced to 32% of the territory, but in 2011 the trend towards reducing reverts to increase [[forest]] cover by eight percentage points to stand at nearly 40% of territory. The success of the Dominican forest growth is due to several Dominican government policies and private organizations for the purpose, and a strong educational campaign that has resulted in increased awareness on the [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican people]] of the importance of forests for their welfare and in other forms of life on the [[island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funglode.org/notice/republica-dominicana-aumenta-su-cobertura-boscosa-a-39-7/|title=República Dominicana aumenta su cobertura boscosa a 39.7% - Fundación Global Democracia y Desarrollo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Cordillera Central.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]], Dominican Republic]]
Owing to its mountainous topography, Hispaniola’s climate shows considerable variation over short distances, and is the most varied of all the [[Antilles]].&lt;ref name="areal"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alpert |first=Leo |title=The Areal Distribution of Mean Annual Rainfall Over the Island of Hispaniola|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1941)069&lt;0201:TADOMA&gt;2.0.CO;2|year=1941|volume=69|pages=201|journal=Monthly Weather Review|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except in the Northern Hemisphere summer season, the predominant winds over Hispaniola are the northeast [[trade winds]]. As in Jamaica and Cuba, these winds deposit their moisture on the northern mountains, and create a distinct [[rain shadow]] on the southern coast, where some areas receive as little as {{convert|400|mm|in|0}} of rainfall, and have [[semi-arid climate]]s. Annual rainfall under {{convert|600|mm|in|0}} also occurs on the southern coast of Haiti’s northwest peninsula and in the central Azúa region of the ''Plaine du Cul-de-Sac''. In these regions, moreover, there is generally little rainfall outside hurricane season from August to October, and droughts are by no means uncommon when hurricanes do not come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Camberlin |first=Pierre |doi=10.3354/cr00856|url=http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/49/82/26/PDF/camberlin_CR_revised.pdf|title=More variable tropical climates have a slower demographic growth|year=2010|journal=Climate Research|volume=41|pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:View of Haitian Landscape hispaniola.jpg|thumbnail|[[Les Cayes]], [[Sud (department)|Sud]], Haiti]]

On the northern coast, in contrast, rainfall may peak between December and February, though some rain falls in all months of the year. Annual amounts typically range from {{convert|1700|to|2000|mm|in|0}} on the northern coastal lowlands;&lt;ref name="areal"/&gt; there is probably much more in the [[Cordillera Septentrional]], though no data exist.

The interior of Hispaniola, along with the southeastern coast centered around Santo Domingo, typically receives around {{convert|1400|mm|in|0}} per year, with a distinct wet season from May to October. Usually, this wet season has two peaks: one around May, the other around the hurricane season. In the interior highlands, rainfall is much greater, around {{convert|3100|mm|in}} per year, but with a similar pattern to that observed in the central lowlands.

As is usual for tropical islands, variations of temperature are much less marked than rainfall variations, and depend only on altitude. Lowland Hispaniola is generally oppressively hot and humid, with temperatures averaging {{convert|28|C|F}}. with high humidity during the daytime, and around {{convert|20|C|F}} at night. At higher altitudes, temperatures fall steadily, so that [[frost]]s occur during the dry season on the highest peaks, where maxima are no higher than {{convert|18|C|F}}.

==Demographics==
The Dominican Republic is a [[Hispanophone]] nation of approximately 10 million people. Spanish is spoken by all Dominicans as a primary language. Roman Catholicism is the official and dominant religion.

Haiti is a [[Geographical distribution of French speakers|Francophone]] nation of roughly 10 million people. Although French is spoken as a primary language by the educated and wealthy minority, virtually the entire population speaks [[Haitian Creole]], one of several French-derived creole languages. Roman Catholicism is the dominant religion, practiced by more than half the population, although in some cases in combination with [[Haitian Vodou]] faith. Another 25% of the populace belong to [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook|website=Cia.gov|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haiti emerged as the first Black republic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Palmbeachschools.org|title=Haitians Heroes|url=http://www.palmbeachschools.org/pao/creole/documents/HaitiansHeroesandHaitiPostersPDF.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021081618/http://www.palmbeachschools.org/pao/Creole/documents/HaitiansHeroesandHaitiPostersPDF.pdf|archivedate=October 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the world.

===Ethnic composition===
The ethnic composition of the Dominican population is 73% [[mulatto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOMINICAN REPUBLIC|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/Dominican-Republic.html|website=Encyclopedia of the Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; 16% white and 11% black. Descendants of early Spanish settlers and of black slaves from West Africa constitute the two main racial strains.

The ethnic composition of Haiti is estimated to be 95% black and 5% white and mulatto.

==Economics==
The island has the largest economy in the [[Greater Antilles]], however most of the economic development is found in the Dominican Republic, the Dominican economy being nearly 800% larger than the Haitian economy.

The estimated [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|annual per capita income]] is US$1,300 in Haiti and US$8,200 in Dominican Republic.&lt;ref name="usat201001"&gt;{{Cite news| first=Marisol | last=Bello | title=Hispaniola comparison | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-01-21-Haiti-Dominican_N.htm?csp=34| work= | publisher=USA Today | pages=  | date=January 21, 2010  | accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The divergence between the level of economic development between [[Haiti]] and [[Dominican Republic]] makes its border the higher contrast of all western land borders and is evident that the Dominican Republic has one of the highest migration issues in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/07/dominican-republic-haiti-long-history-conflict|title=The Dominican Republic and Haiti: one island riven by an unresolved past {{!}} Carrie Gibson|last=Gibson|first=Carrie|date=2013-10-07|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island also has an economic history and current day interest and involvement in precious metals. Writing in 1860, Courtney observed that the island contained a large supply of gold, of which the early Spaniards had hardly developed.&lt;ref name="Courtney"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Courtney|first1=W.S.|title=The Gold Fields of St. Domingo|date=1860|publisher=Anson P. Norton|location=New York|pages=123–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1919, Condit and Ross noted much of the island is covered by government granted concessions for mining different types of minerals. Besides gold, these minerals included silver, manganese, copper, magnetite, iron and nickel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Condit|first1=D. Dale|last2=Ross|first2=Clyde P.|title=Economic Geology, Chapter X, in A Geological Reconnaissance of the Dominican Republic|date=1921|publisher=United States Geological Survey|location=Washington|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mining operations in 2016 have taken advantage of the [[volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit]]s (VMS) around [[Maimón]]. To the northeast, the Pueblo Viejo Gold Mine was operated by state-owned Rosario Dominicana from 1975 until 1991. In 2009, Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Corporation, formed by [[Barrick Gold]] and [[Goldcorp]], started [[open-pit mining]] operations of the Monte Negro and Moore oxide deposits. The mined ore is processed with [[gold cyanidation]]. [[Pyrite]] and [[sphalerite]] are the main [[sulfide minerals]] found in the 120 m thick [[volcanic]] [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] and [[agglomerate]]s, which constitute the world's second largest sulphidation gold deposit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pueblo Viejo Gold Mine, Dominican Republic|url=http://www.mining-technology.com/projects/pueblo-viejo-gold-mine/|publisher=mining-technology.com|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between [[Bonao]] and Maimon, [[Falconbridge Ltd.|Falconbridge Dominicana]] has been mining [[nickel]] [[laterite]]s since 1971. The Cerro de Maimon copper/gold open-pit mine southeast of Maimon has been operated by Perilya since 2006. Copper is extracted from the sulfide ores, while gold and silver are extracted from both the sulfide and the oxide ores. Processing is via [[froth flotation]] and cyanidation. The ore is located in the VMS [[Early Cretaceous]] Maimon [[formation (geology)|Formation]]. [[Goethite]] enriched with gold and silver is found in the 30 m thick oxide cap. Below that cap is a [[supergene (geology)|supergene]] zone containing pyrite, [[chalcopyrite]], and sphalerite. Below the supergene zone is found the unaltered massive sulphide mineralization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cerro de Maimon|url=http://www.perilya.com.au/our-business/operations/cerro-de-maimon|publisher=Perilya.com|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precious metals==
Christopher Columbus, noting "the land and trees resembled those of Spain, and that the sailors caught in their nets many fish like those of Spain...named it Espanola on Sunday, December 9th." One of the first inhabitants he came across on this island was "a girl wearing only a gold nose plug." Columbus later learned that the "land of gold was farther east." Soon the Tainos were trading pieces of gold for hawk's bells with their [[cacique]] declaring the gold came from [[Cibao]]. Traveling further east from Navidad, Columbus came across the [[Yaque del Norte River]], which he named Rio de Oro because its "sands abound in gold dust."&lt;ref name=Ferdinand&gt;{{cite book|last1=Columbus|first1=Ferdinand|title=The Life of the Admiral Christopher Columbus by his son Ferdinand|date=1959|publisher=Rutgers, The State University|location=New Brunswick|pages=76–77, 83, 87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Columbus' return during his second voyage he learned it was the cacique Caonabo, "lord of the mines", who had massacred his settlement at Navidad. While Columbus established a new settlement at [[La Isabela]] on Jan. 1494, he sent [[Alonso de Ojeda]] and 15 men to search for the mines of Cibao. After a six-day journey, Ojeda came across an area containing gold, in which the gold was extracted from streams by the Taino people. Columbus himself visited the mines of Cibao on 12 March 1494. He constructed the Fort of Santo Tomas, present day [[Janico]], with Captain Pedro Margarit in command of 56 men.&lt;ref name=Ferdinand/&gt;{{rp|119,122–126}}

On 24 March 1495, Columbus with his ally [[Guacanagarix]], embarked on a war of revenge against Caonabo, capturing him and his family while killing and capturing many natives. Afterwards, every person over the age of fourteen had to produce a hawksbill of gold.&lt;ref name=Ferdinand/&gt;{{rp|149–150}}

Miguel Diaz and [[Francisco de Garay]] discovered large [[gold nugget]]s on the lower [[Haina River]] in 1496. These San Cristobal mines were later known as the Minas Viejas mines. Then, in 1499, the first major discovery of gold was made in the [[cordillera]] central, which led to a mining boom. By 1501, Columbus' cousin Giovanni Colombo, had discovered gold near Buenaventura, the deposits were later known as Minas Nuevas. Two major mining areas resulted, one along [[San Cristobal, Dominican Republic|San Cristobal]]-Buenaventura, and another in Cibao within the [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|La Vega]]-Cotuy-[[Bonao]] triangle, while [[Santiago de los Caballeros]], [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|Concepcion]], and Bonao became mining towns. The [[gold rush]] of 1500–1508 ensued.&lt;ref name="Floyd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Floyd|first1=Troy|title=The Columbus Dynasty in the Caribbean, 1492–1526|date=1973|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|pages=44, 50, 57–58, 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ovando expropriated the gold mines of Miguel Diaz and Francisco de Garay in 1504, as pit mines became royal mines for [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]], who reserved the best mines for himself, though [[placer mining|placers]] were open to private prospectors. Furthermore, Ferdinand kept 967 natives in the San Cristobal mining area supervised by salaried miners.&lt;ref name=Floyd/&gt;{{rp|68,71,78,125–127}}

Under [[Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres]]' governorship, the Indians were made to work in the gold mines, where, according to Pons, they were overworked and underfed. By 1503, the Spanish Crown legalized the distribution of Indians to work the mines as part of the [[encomienda]] system. Pons says that once the Indians entered the mines, they were often wiped out by hunger and difficult conditions. By 1508 the Indian population of about 400,000 was reduced to 60,000, and by 1514, only 26,334 remained. About half were located in the mining towns of Concepcion, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and Buenaventura. The [[repartimiento]] of 1514 accelerated emigration of the Spanish colonists, coupled with the exhaustion of the mines. In 1516, a smallpox epidemic killed an additional 8,000, of the remaining 11,000 Indians, in one month.&lt;ref name="Pons"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pons|first1=Frank|title=The Dominican Republic, A National History|date=1995|publisher=Hispaniola Books|location=New Rochelle|isbn=1885509014|pages=33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Floyd/&gt;{{rp|191–192}}

A '''horticultural flora''', also known as a [[garden]] flora, is a plant identification aid structured in the same way as a [[native plant]]s [[Flora (publication)|flora]]. It serves the same purpose: to facilitate plant identification; however, it only includes plants that are under cultivation as [[ornamental plant]]s growing within the prescribed climate zone or region. Traditionally published in book form, often in several volumes, such floras are increasingly likely to be produced as websites or CD ROMs.

==Scope and contents==
Horticultural floras include both [[cultigen]]s (plants deliberately altered in some way by human activity) and those wild plants brought directly into cultivation that do not have cultigen names. They might also include colour images and useful information specific to the zone or region including:
* historical details about outstanding public and private cultivated plant collections
* exceptional trees (age, history, rarity, size etc.)
* prominent nurserymen and plant breeders
* references to the taxonomic and other literature on the plant groups
* easy "spotting" or "field" characters useful for quick identification
* notes on [[ecology]] (especially the potential of plants to naturalise and become [[Invasive species|invasive]])
* horticultural history of introduction

==Uses==
Written by a professional plant [[taxonomist]] or [[Plantsman|plantsperson]], a horticultural flora assists clarification of scientific and common names, the identification of plant characteristics that occur in cultivated plants that are additional to those in wild counterparts, and descriptions of [[cultivar]]s.

Although horticultural floras may include a range of food plants, their emphasis is generally on ornamental plants and so these floras are sometimes referred to as "garden floras". Increasingly they provide data for [[sustainable landscaping]], such as:
* [[xeriscape|drought tolerance]] and irrigation needs
* food sources of native and migratory bird and [[butterfly]] species
* [[companion planting]]
* invasive species notation
* local [[ecological restoration|habitat restoration]] aspects.

'''Iceberg B-31''' is a large [[iceberg]] that formed in November 2013, when it separated from the [[Pine Island Glacier]]. B-31 is heading into the [[Antarctic ocean]], which may have possible repercusions for international shipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlowicz|first1=Michael|title=Drifting with ice island B31|url=http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=83519|website=www.nasa.gov|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/22/world/asia/antarctic-iceberg/index.html|title=Iceberg is twice the size of Atlanta - CNN.com|first=By Brad Lendon|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1284243/watch-iceberg-six-times-of-manhattan-on-the-move-in-antarctic/|title=WATCH: Iceberg 6 times the size of Manhattan on the move in Antarctic|first=Nicole|last=Mortillaro|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyjoe.com/2014/04/22/news/city-sized-iceberg-drifting-into-southern-ocean/|title=City-Sized Iceberg Drifting Out to Sea|date=22 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon it would not be possible to track the iceberg as the winter darkness completely hides it. The ice island is 20 miles by 12 miles and 500 m of height. It was first observed by [[Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer]] (MODIS), an instrument on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites of NASA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7526">The '''Indices of deprivation 2004''' ('''ID 2004''') is a [[deprivation index]] at the small [[area]] level, created by the British [[Department for Communities and Local Government]](DCLG).

It is unusual in its inclusion of a measure of geographical access as an element of deprivation and in its direct measure of [[poverty]] (through data on benefit receipts). The ID 2004 is based on the idea of distinct dimensions of deprivation which can be recognised and measured separately. These are then combined into a single overall measure. The Index is made up of seven distinct dimensions of deprivation called Domain Indices. Whilst it is known as the ID2004, most of the data actually dates from 2001.

==History==
Communities and Local Government (previously the Office of Deputy Prime Minister) commissioned the Social Disadvantage Research Centre (SDRC) at the Department of Social Policy and Social Work at the University of Oxford to update the Indices of  deprivation 2004 (ID 2004) for England. Following an extensive public consultation (see Annex A), an independent academic peer review and a significant programme of work, the new Indices of Deprivation 2007 were produced in December 2007.

The new Index of Multiple Deprivation 2007 (IMD 2007) is a Lower layer Super Output Area (LSOA) level measure of multiple deprivation, and is made up of seven LSOA level domain indices. There are also two supplementary indices (Income Deprivation Affecting Children and Income Deprivation Affecting Older People). Summary measures of the IMD 2007 are presented at local authority district level and county council level. The LSOA level Domain Indices and IMD 2007, together with the local authority district and county summaries are referred to as the Indices of Deprivation 2007 (ID 2007).(Rusty 2009)

The ID 2007 are based on the approach, structure and methodology that were used to create the previous ID 2004. The ID 2007 updates the ID 2004 using more up-to-date data. The new IMD 2007 contains seven domains which relate to income deprivation, employment deprivation, health deprivation and disability, education skills and training deprivation, barriers to housing and services, living environment deprivation, and crime.

==Domain Indices==

*'''Income'''

:The purpose of this Domain is to capture the proportions of the population experiencing income deprivation in an area. 
*'''Employment'''

:This Domain measures employment deprivation by considering people of working age who are involuntarily excluded from the world of work, either through unemployment. ill health or family circumstances. 

*'''Health and disability'''

:This Domain identifies areas with relatively high rates of people who die prematurely or whose quality of life is impaired by poor health or who are disabled, across the whole population. 

*'''Education, skills and training'''

:The purpose of the Domain is to capture the extent of deprivation in education, skills and training in a local area. The indicators fall into two sub-domains: one relating to lack of attainment among children and young people and one relating to lack of qualifications in terms of skills. These two sub-domains are designed to reflect the ‘flow’ and ‘stock’ of educational disadvantage within an area respectively. That is, the children/young people sub-domain measures the deprivation in the attaining of qualifications, while the skills sub-domain measures the deprivation in the resident working age adult population. 

*'''Barriers to Housing and Services'''

:The purpose of this Domain is to measure barriers to housing and key local services. The indicators fall into two sub-domains: ‘geographical barriers’ and ‘wider barriers’ which includes issues relating to access to housing such as affordability. 

*'''Living environment'''

:This Domain focuses on deprivation in the living environment. It comprises two sub-domains: the ‘indoors’ living environment which measures the quality of housing and the ‘outdoors’ living environment which contains two measures about air quality and road traffic accidents. 

*'''Crime'''

:This Domain measures the rate of recorded crime for four major crime themes – burglary, theft, criminal damage and violence - representing the occurrence of personal and material victimisation at a small area level.

Each Domain contains a number of indicators, totalling 37. Two supplementary indexes have been created as a subset of the Income domain. These relate to income deprivation affecting children and income deprivation affecting older people.

==Geography==

The Indices of deprivation 2004 are measured at the Lower Layer Super Output Area level. [[Super Output Areas]] were developed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) from the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|Census 2001]] Output Areas. There are two levels, the lowest (which the Index is based upon) being smaller than wards and containing a minimum of 1,000 people and 400 households. The middle layer contains a minimum of 5,000 people and 2,000 households. Earlier proposals to introduce Upper Layer Super Output Areas were dropped due to lack of demand. 

In addition to Super Output Areas, Summaries of the ID 2004 are presented at District level, County level and Primary Care Trust (PCT) level.

While each SOA is of higher resolution than the highest resolution ''ward'' index data of the IMD2000 and therefore better at identifying "pockets" of deprivation within wards the 2004 system has its problems. Some areas of deprivation can still be hidden because of the size of SOAs. Examples of this can be found by comparing central areas of [[Keighley]] using the Bradford District Deprivation Index (a [[Deprivation index]] developed by [[City of Bradford|Bradford Council]] produced at 1991 Census [[Enumeration District]] level) with the ID2004.
Additionally SOAs were tasked with providing complete coverage of England and Wales - this combined with the minimum population and household counts within each SOA means that large areas of agricultural, commercial and industrial land have to be included within a residential area that borders them - thus when some very deprived residential areas are mapped, a large area of supposed deprivation emerges, however most of it may not be so but rather has a wide area of relative affluence around it - these can appear to be a greater problem than many smaller completely residential SOAs in which higher concentrations of deprived people live but mixed with more affluent neighbours.

'''Leonard Borejko Chodźko''' (1800–1871) was a [[Poland|Polish]] historian, geographer, cartographer, publisher, archivist, and activist of Poland's post-[[November Uprising|November-1830-Uprising]] [[Great Emigration]].

==Life==
Chodźko was educated at the [[University of Vilnius]], where he was a member of the [[Philomath]]s, a secret organization established in 1816 by Vilnius University students including [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Tomasz Zan]] and [[Józef Jeżowski]].&lt;ref&gt;"''Filomaci''," ''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1826 he lived in Paris. During France's [[July Revolution|July 1830 Revolution]], he served as [[aide-de-camp]] to General [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|La Fayette]].

This fight echoes others throughout the season (though not always bare-knuckle), through which [[SAMCRO]] members (e.g., [[Tig Trager]] and [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Herman Kozik|Herman Kozik]]) express their tensions and bond. In his recap of "Orca Shrugged",  [[Hitfix]]'s Geoff Berkshire writes: "The bare knuckle brawl between Jax and Galen O'Shay made me wonder if anyone on the "Sons" staff was influenced by the documentary "Knuckle." (That wouldn't be a bad thing.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Hitfix|title=''Sons of Anarchy'' recap: 'Orca Shrugged' goes to extremes|author=Berkshire, Geoff|date= October 9, 2012 |url= http://www.hitfix.com/monkeys-as-critics/sons-of-anarchy-recap-orca-shrugged-goes-to-extremes#Ki64bWwI5rwzChpu.99 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Singin' Bernie Walsh'' — Character created and played by Irish comedian [[Katherine Lynch]], who is known for her album ''Friends In Hi Aces'' and her singles "Dundalk, Dundalk", "Don't Knock Knock 'Til You've Tried It", and "Stand By Your Van".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5211">Before the [[Athenian democracy]], the [[tyrant]]s, and the [[Archon]]s, the [[city-state]] of '''[[Athens]] was ruled by [[monarch|kings]]'''. Most of these are probably [[mythology|myth]]ical or only semi-historical.

==Earliest kings==
These three kings were supposed to have ruled before the [[Ancient Greek flood myths|flood of Deucalion]].

| [[Ogyges]]&lt;ref&gt;King of Agea, not Athens; The name of Ogyges is also connected with Attic mythology, for in Attica too an Ogygian flood is mentioned, and he is described as the father of the Attic hero [[Eleusis (mythology)|Eleusis]] ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.38.7 1.38.7])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology: Oarses-Zygia.

==Erechtheid dynasty==
The early Athenian tradition, followed by the 3rd century BC [[Parian Chronicle]], made Cecrops, a mythical half-man half-serpent, the first king of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, pp. 20&amp;ndash;22; Gantz, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The dates for the following kings were conjectured centuries later, by historians of the [[Hellenistic era]] who tried to backdate events by cross-referencing earlier sources such as the Parian Chronicle. Tradition says that King Menestheus took part in the [[Trojan War]].

The following list follows that of 1st Century BC [[Castor of Rhodes]] ([[Fragmente der griechischen Historiker|''FGrHist'']] 250), with Castor's dates given in modern terms.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Melanthid dynasty==
Melanthus having been driven from his kingdom in [[Pylos]] came to Athens where Thymoestes resigned the crown to him. Codrus, the last king, repelled the [[Dorian Invasion]] of [[Attica]].

After Codrus's death, his sons Medon and Acastus either reigned as kings, or became hereditary [[archons]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias's Description of Greece – Volume 3 – [https://books.google.com/books?id=LjNPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA64 Page 64]. (cf. ''The successors of Codrus were Medon (son of Codrus), Acastus (son of Medon) [...]'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'' §3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 753 BC the hereditary archonship was replaced by a non-hereditary system (see [[Archons of Athens]]).

MAVEN was launched aboard an [[Atlas V]] [[launch vehicle]] at the beginning of the first [[launch window]] on November 18, 2013.  Following the first engine burn of the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] second stage, the vehicle coasted in [[low Earth orbit]] for 27 minutes before a second Centaur burn of five minutes to insert it into a [[heliocentric orbit|heliocentric]] Mars [[Hohmann transfer orbit|transit orbit]].

On September 22, 2014, MAVEN reached Mars and was inserted into an [[Areocentric orbit|areocentric]] [[elliptic orbit]] {{convert|6200|km|mi|abbr=on}} by {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the planet's surface. The [[principal investigator]] for the spacecraft is [[Bruce Jakosky]] of the [[Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics]] at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140921" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140921" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140917"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hansen |first=Izumi |last2=Zubritsky |first2=Elizabeth |title=NASA Mars Spacecraft Ready for Sept. 21 Orbit Insertion |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-314 |date=September 17, 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=September 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasas-maven-spacecraft-makes-final-preparations-for-mars/|title=NASA's MAVEN Spacecraft Makes Final Preparations For Mars|work=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 2015, NASA announced that data from MAVEN shows that the deterioration of Mars' atmosphere increases significantly during [[solar flare|solar storms]]. That loss of atmosphere to space likely played a key role in Mars' gradual shift from its [[carbon dioxide]]-dominated atmosphere – which had kept Mars relatively warm and allowed the planet to support liquid surface water – to the cold, arid planet seen today. This shift took place between about 4.2 and 3.7 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="NASA-15217"&gt;{{cite web |last=Northon |first=Karen |title=NASA Mission Reveals Speed of Solar Wind Stripping Martian Atmosphere |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-mission-reveals-speed-of-solar-wind-stripping-martian-atmosphere |date=November 5, 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Mars Lost Atmosphere to Space as Life Took Hold on Earth |url= http://www.space.com/31031-mars-atmosphere-discovery-nasa-maven.html?adbid=662349226177761280&amp;adbpl=tw&amp;adbpr=15431856 |date=November 5, 2015 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission was spawned by [[NASA]]'s [[Mars Scout Program]], which, although discontinued in 2010, yielded [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]], MAVEN, and numerous missions' studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/NASA-s-Scout-Program-Discontinued-149866.shtml|title=NASA's Scout Program Discontinued|author=Tudor Vieru|date=July 30, 2010|work=softpedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mars Scout missions target a cost of less than US$485 million, not including launch services, which cost approximately $187 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/oct/HQ_C10-065_Maven_Services.html NASA Awards Launch Services Contract for Maven Mission] (October 21, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The total project costs up to $671 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/09/140919-mars-maven-nasa-space-missions-science-ngspace/ | title=With NASA Probe's Arrival, International Mars Invasion Gets Under Way | work=[[National Geographic Magazine]] | date=19 September 2014 | accessdate=24 September 2014 | author=Vergano, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NASA's Maven Craft Beats India's Mangalyaan in Space Race to Mars|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/09/22/nasas-maven-craft-beats-indias-mangalyaan-in-space-race-to-mars/|accessdate=22 September 2014|publisher=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India Satellite Mangalyaan Reaches Mars Orbit on First Try|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/09/24/indias-mangalyaan-enters-mars-orbit/?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsForth|accessdate=24 September 2014|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, 2008, NASA announced that it had selected MAVEN to be the Mars Scout 2013 mission.&lt;ref name=selection&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/news/maven_20080915.html|title=NASA – NASA Selects 'MAVEN' Mission to Study Mars Atmosphere|work=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Thumbs Up Given for 2013 NASA Mars Orbiter | date = October 5, 2010 | url = http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-323 | accessdate = October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was one other finalist and eight other proposals that were competing against MAVEN. The name is a deliberate use of the word ''[[maven]]'', "a person who has special knowledge or experience; an expert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA's MAVEN Mission @MAVEN2Mars|url=https://twitter.com/maven2mars/status/394917251918618624|website=Twitter.com|accessdate=7 March 2015|quote=Fittingly, from #Hebrew, via #Yiddish, a "maven" is a trusted expert who understands and seeks to pass knowledge on to others. #MAVEN #Mars}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink1=Houghton Mifflin |title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |date=2000 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=0-395-82517-2 |page=1082 |edition=4th |url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=maven |accessdate=7 March 2015 |quote=A person who has special knowledge or experience; an expert.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2, 2013, the MAVEN spacecraft arrived at [[Kennedy Space Center]] [[Florida]] to begin launch preparations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.nasa.gov/press/2013/august/nasa-begins-launch-preparations-for-next-mars-mission/index.html |title=NASA Begins Launch Preparations for Next Mars Mission |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |date=August 5, 2013 |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA scheduled the launch of MAVEN from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] on November 18, 2013, using an [[Atlas V]] 401 rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=31905 |title=NASA Awards Launch Services Contract for MAVEN Mission | accessdate=October 21, 2010 | publisher=SpaceRef}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The probe arrived in Mars orbit in September 2014, at approximately the same time as India's [[Mars Orbiter Mission]].

On October 1, 2013, only seven weeks before launch, a [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|government shutdown]] caused suspension of work for two days and initially threatened to force a 26-month postponement of the mission. With the spacecraft nominally scheduled to launch on November 18, a delay beyond December 7 would have caused MAVEN to miss the launch window as [[Mars]] moved too far out of alignment with the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elliott|first=Danielle|title=Government shutdown could delay NASA's Mars MAVEN mission to 2017|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57605688/government-shutdown-could-delay-nasas-mars-maven-mission-to-2017/|accessdate=October 3, 2013|newspaper=CBS News|date=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, two days later, a public announcement was made that NASA had deemed the 2013 MAVEN launch so essential to ensuring future communication with current NASA assets on Mars—the [[Opportunity (rover)|Opportunity]] and [[Curiosity rover]]s—that emergency funding was authorized to restart spacecraft processing in preparation for an on-time launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jakosky |first=Bruce |url=http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/maven/2013/10/03/maven-reactivation-status-update/ |title=MAVEN reactivation status update |publisher=Laboratory of Atmospheric and Space Physics |date=September 20, 2013 |accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Richard A. | last = Kerr | title = Shutdown Won't Prevent NASA's MAVEN Mission From Lifting Off | date = October 4, 2013 | url = http://news.sciencemag.org/people-events/2013/10/shutdown-wont-prevent-nasas-maven-mission-lifting | work = Science Magazine | accessdate = October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 2014, at approximately 2:24 UTC, MAVEN spacecraft entered orbit around Mars, completing an interplanetary journey of 10 months and 442 million miles (711 million kilometers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/maven/main/ |title=MAVEN Arrives at Mars |work=NASA |date=21 September 2014 |accessdate=2014-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Features on Mars that resemble dry [[Stream bed|riverbeds]] and the discovery of minerals that form in the presence of water indicate that Mars once had a [[Atmosphere of Mars|dense enough atmosphere]] and was warm enough for [[Water on Mars|liquid water]] to flow on the surface. However, that thick atmosphere was somehow lost to space. Scientists suspect that over millions of years, Mars lost 99% of its atmosphere as the planet's core cooled and its magnetic field decayed, allowing the [[solar wind]] to sweep away most of the water and volatile compounds that the atmosphere once contained.&lt;ref name=sun-steals&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/maven/news/confirmation.html MAVEN Mission to Investigate How Sun Steals Martian Atmosphere] By Bill Steigerwald (October 5, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of MAVEN is to determine the history of the loss of atmospheric gases to space, providing answers about [[Climate of Mars|Martian climate]] evolution.  By measuring the rate with which the atmosphere is currently escaping to space and gathering enough information about the relevant processes, scientists will be able to infer how [[Atmosphere of Mars|the planet's atmosphere]] evolved over time. The MAVEN mission has four primary scientific objectives:

Mars loses water into its thin atmosphere by evaporation. There, solar radiation can split the water molecules into their components, hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen, as the lightest element, then tends to rise far up to the highest levels of the Martian atmosphere, where several processes can strip it away into space, to be forever lost to the planet. This loss was thought to proceed at a fairly constant rate, but MAVEN's observations of Mars's atmospheric hydrogen through a full Martian year (almost two Earth years) show that the escape rate is highest when Mars's orbit brings it closest to the Sun, and only one-tenth as great when it is at its farthest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |date=2016-10-22 |title=NASA's MAVEN Mission Observes Ups and Downs of Water Escape from Mars |url= http://www.astrobio.net/also-in-news/nasas-maven-mission-observes-ups-downs-water-escape-mars/ |work= Astrobiology Magazine |location= |access-date= 2016-10-23 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ang |first=Brian |date=2016-10-21 |title=NASA: MAVEN mission probes 'water-escaping' occurrences on Mars |url= http://www.hngn.com/amp/articles/212920/20161021/nasa-s-maven-mission-probes-mars-water-spilling-space-puzzle.htm  |work=HNGN |location= |access-date= 2016-10-23  | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malkumba-Coongie Lakes National Park''' is a [[protected area]] located in the north-east of [[South Australia]] about {{convert|110|km|abbr=off}} north-west of [[Innamincka, South Australia|Innamincka]].  The national park was proclaimed on 31 March 2005 as the Coongie Lakes National Park under ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]'' over a parcel of land previously part of the [[Innamincka Regional Reserve]] to "conserve significant wetlands, provide experiences for visitors and ensure that the core component of the Coongie Lakes system was protected."  The national park is located on land that was included on the [[List of Wetlands of International Importance]] under the [[Ramsar Convention]] under the name, [[Coongie Lakes]] in 1987.  In 2014, the national park was renamed as the Malkumba-Coongie Lakes National Park.  The national park is co-managed by the [[Department of Environment and Water (South Australia)|Department of Environment and Water]] (DEW), the Yandruwandha Yawarrawarrka Parks Advisory Committee and South Australian Arid Lands Natural Resources Management Board.  It is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category II — National Park|Category II protected area]].&lt;ref name=gazateer&gt;{{Gazetteer of Australia|name= Coongie Lakes National Park|feature= SA0016973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MP&gt;{{cite web|title= Malkumba-Coongie Lakes National Park Management Plan 2014 |url= http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/ade01b4c-5dcb-4a5c-b261-a41900bf0b40/malkumba-coongie-lakes-management-plan.pdf|publisher= Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources |accessdate=15 January 2015|date= 2014|pages =2,4&amp;9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Coongie Lakes Ramsar wetlands; a plan for wise use |url= http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/ca6cccb1-b4d2-4529-9cc7-9e3100cab00c/coongie.pdf |publisher= Department of Environment, Heritage &amp; Aboriginal Affairs|accessdate=15 January 2015|date= 1999|page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New name for the Coongie Lakes National Park|url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/92fe6dbd-94de-45ec-bf71-a38e01174861/140807-coongie-lakes-name-change-nws.pdf|publisher=Government of South Australia|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CAPAD2012SASum&gt;{{cite web|title= Terrestrial Protected Areas of South Australia (see 'DETAIL' tab)|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/0f927a4e-336a-490c-a896-ec37874a5c73/files/capad2012sa.xlsx|work=CAPAD 2012|publisher=Australian Government - Department of the Environment|accessdate=6 February 2014|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mars 2''' was an unmanned space probe of the [[Mars program]], a series of unmanned [[Mars]] [[Lander (spacecraft)|landers]] and [[orbiter]]s launched by the [[Soviet Union]] May 19, 1971. The Mars 2 and [[Mars 3]] missions consisted of identical spacecraft, each with an orbiter and an attached lander. The orbiter is identical to the [[Venera 9]] bus or orbiter. The type of bus/orbiter is the 4MV. They were launched by a [[Proton-K]] heavy launch vehicle with a Blok D upper stage. The lander of Mars 2 became the first man-made object to reach the surface of Mars, although the landing system failed and the lander was lost.

==Overview==
* Launch Date/Time:
** Mars 2: 19 May 1971 at 16:22:44 UTC
* Launch mass (including fuel):
** Combined: {{convert|4650|kg|lb|abbr=on}}
** Orbiter: {{convert|3440|kg|lb|abbr=on}}
** Lander: {{convert|1210|kg|lb|abbr=on}}
* On-orbit dry mass: {{convert|2265|kg|lb|abbr=on}}
* Dimensions: {{convert|4.1|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|2|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} across ({{convert|5.9|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} across with solar panels deployed)

==Launch==
On May 19, 1971, the [[Proton-K]] heavy launch vehicle launched the probe from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]]. After the first stage separated the second stage was ignited. The third stage engine blasted Mars 2 into parking orbit, then the Blok D upper stage sent Mars 2 on the trans-Mars trajectory.

==Orbiter==
The Orbiter type was the 4MV, used also for Mars-3 and later Mars and Venera Probes. The orbiter engine performed a burn to put the spacecraft into a {{nowrap|1380 x 24,940 km}}, 18-hour orbit about Mars with an inclination of 48.9 degrees. Scientific instruments were generally turned on for about 30 minutes near periapsis.

The orbiter's primary scientific objectives were to image the Martian surface and clouds, determine the temperature on Mars, study the topography, composition and physical properties of the surface, measure properties of the atmosphere, monitor the [[solar wind]] and the interplanetary and Martian [[magnetic field]]s, and act as a communications relay to send signals from the landers to the Earth.

By coincidence, a particularly large [[Storm#Extraterrestrial storms|dust storm]] on Mars adversely affected the mission.  When [[Mariner 9]] arrived and successfully orbited Mars on 14 November 1971, just two weeks prior to Mars 2 and Mars 3, [[Planetary science|planetary scientists]] were surprised to find the [[celestial body's atmosphere|atmosphere]] was thick with "a planet-wide robe of [[dust]], the largest storm ever observed."  The surface was totally obscured.  Unable to reprogram the mission computers, both Mars 2 and Mars 3 dispatched their landers immediately, and the orbiters used up a significant portion of their available data resources in snapping images of the featureless dust clouds below, rather than the surface mapping intended.&lt;ref name=Pyle2012-M9&gt;
{{cite book |last=Pyle|first=Rod |title=Destination Mars |year=2012 |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |isbn=978-1-61614-589-7 |pages=73–78 |quote=''...Mars 2 and Mars 3.  Both reached Mars shortly after Mariner 9.  Unfortunately, these Soviet ships were not reprogrammable, as was the case with Mariner 9, and rather than wait out the huge, planet-wide dust storm, they proceeded to follow their programming right on schedule.  Landers were dispatched from each, the first crashing and the second apparently reaching the surface intact but losing radio contact immediately.  The orbiters fared little better; following their simple logic, both used up their available resources snapping images of the featureless dust clouds below.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mars 2 orbiter sent back data covering the period from December 1971 to March 1972, although transmissions continued through August. It was announced that Mars 2 and Mars 3 had completed their missions by 22 August 1972, after 362 orbits. The probe, combined with Mars 3, sent back a total of 60 pictures. The images and data revealed mountains as high as 22&amp;nbsp;km, atomic hydrogen and oxygen in the upper atmosphere, surface temperatures ranging from −110&amp;nbsp;°C to +13&amp;nbsp;°C, surface pressures of 5.5 to 6 mbar (0.55 to 0.6 [[kilopascal|kPa]]), water vapor concentrations 5,000 times less than in the Earth's atmosphere, the base of the ionosphere starting at 80 to 110&amp;nbsp;km altitude, and grains from dust storms as high as 7&amp;nbsp;km in the atmosphere. The images and data enabled the creation of surface [[Raised-relief map|relief map]]s,&lt;ref name=Perminov1&gt;{{cite book|last=Perminov|first=V.G.|title=The Difficult Road to Mars - A Brief History of Mars Exploration in the Soviet Union|year=July 1999|publisher=NASA Headquarters History Division|isbn=0-16-058859-6|pages=34–60|url=https://history.nasa.gov/monograph15.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave information on Martian [[gravity]] and magnetic fields. The orbiter remains in Martian orbit.

===Lander spacecraft system===
The Mars 2 descent module was mounted on the bus/orbiter opposite the propulsion system. It consisted of a spherical 1.2 m diameter landing capsule, a 2.9 m diameter conical aerodynamic braking shield, a parachute system and retro-rockets.

The entire descent module had a fueled mass of 1210&amp;nbsp;kg, the spherical landing capsule accounting for 358&amp;nbsp;kg of this. An automatic control system consisting of gas micro-engines and pressurised nitrogen containers provided attitude control. Four "gunpowder" engines were mounted to the outer edge of the cone to control pitch and yaw.

The main and auxiliary parachutes, the engine to initiate the landing, and the radar [[altimeter]] were mounted on the top section of the lander. Foam was used to absorb shock within the descent module. The landing capsule had four triangular petals which would open after landing, righting the spacecraft and exposing the instrumentation.

The lander was equipped with two television cameras with a 360 degree view of the surface as well as a [[mass spectrometer]] to study atmospheric composition; temperature, pressure, and wind sensors; and devices to measure mechanical and chemical properties of the surface, including a mechanical scoop to search for organic materials and signs of life. It also contained a pennant with the [[State Emblem of the Soviet Union]].

Four aerials protruded from the top of the sphere to provide communications with the orbiter via an onboard radio system. The equipment was powered by batteries which were charged by the orbiter prior to separation. Temperature control was maintained through thermal insulation and a system of radiators. The landing capsule was sterilised before launch to prevent contamination of the Martian environment.

====Prop-M Rover====
[[File:Mars propm rover.jpg|thumb|right|Mars Prop-M Rover]]
Mars 2 lander had a small 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg [[Mars rover]] on board, which would move across the surface on skis while connected to the lander with a 15-meter umbilical. Two small metal rods were used for autonomous obstacle avoidance, as radio signals from Earth would take too long to drive the rovers using remote control. The rover carried a dynamic penetrometer and a radiation densitometer.&lt;ref name=Perminov1/&gt;

The main PROP-M frame was a squat box with a small protrusion at the center. The frame was supported on two wide flat skis, one extending down from each side elevating the frame slightly above the surface.

The rover was planned to be placed on the surface after landing by a manipulator arm and to move in the field of view of the television cameras and stop to make measurements every 1.5 metres. The traces of movement in the Martian soil would also be recorded to determine material properties.

Because of the demise of the lander, the rover was not deployed.

===Entry, descent, and crash landing===
The descent module separated from the orbiter on 27 November 1971 about 4.5 hours before reaching Mars. After entering the atmosphere at approximately 6&amp;nbsp;km/s, the descent system on the module malfunctioned, possibly because the angle of entry was too steep. The descent sequence did not operate as planned and the parachute did not deploy.&lt;ref name=Perminov1/&gt;
The descent module became the first man-made object to impact the surface of Mars. The exact crash site is unknown, but it is estimated to be at {{Coord|45|S|313|W|display=inline,title|globe:Mars}}.&lt;ref name=Pyle2012-M9/&gt;&lt;ref name="coord"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/space-missions/missions-to-mars.html#mars2 |title=Missions to Mars |publisher=[[The Planetary Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to contact the probe after the crash were unsuccessful.

{{Contains Khmer text}}

The city now known as [[Ho Chi Minh City]] ({{lang-vi|Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh|links=no}} {{Audio|Thanh Pho Ho Chi Minh.ogg|listen|help=no}}), or Saigon (its antecedent), has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups. Originally known as ''Prey Nôkôr'' while a part of the [[Khmer Empire]],&lt;ref group="nb" name="warhope-sihanouk" /&gt; it came to be dubbed ''Sài Gòn'' ({{Audio|Saigon.ogg|listen|help=no}}) informally by Vietnamese settlers fleeing the [[Trịnh–Nguyễn War]] to the north. In time, control of the city and the area passed to the Vietnamese, who gave the city the name of ''Gia Định''. This name remained until the time of [[Cochinchina Campaign|French conquest]] in the 1860s, when the occupying force adopted the name ''Saïgon'' for the city, a [[westernization|westernized]] form of the traditional Vietnamese name.&lt;ref name="salkin-96-354" /&gt; The current name was given after the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975, and honors [[Ho Chi Minh|Hồ Chí Minh]], the first leader of [[North Vietnam]].&lt;ref group="nb" name="hcm-pc" /&gt; Even today, however, the informal name of ''Sài Gòn'' remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the [[overseas Vietnamese|Vietnamese diaspora]] and local southern Vietnamese.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

[[File:GrongPreyNokor colour.png|thumb|right|''Krŭng Prey Nôkôr'', [[Khmer language|Khmer]] for [[Ho Chi Minh City]]. "Prey Nôkôr" is highlighted in red.]]
The area where present-day [[Ho Chi Minh City]] is located was likely inhabited long since prehistory; the empire of [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] and later [[Chenla]] maintained a presence in the [[Mekong Delta]] for centuries.&lt;ref name="salkin-96-353"&gt;{{cite book|title=Asia and Oceania|series=International Dictionary of Historic Places|volume=5|page=353|author1=Robert M.

== Vietnamese names ==

=== Sài Gòn ===
[[File:Ga-saigon2.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Saigon Railway Station|Sài Gòn Railway Station]] retains the traditional name used informally since the 1620s.]]
Beginning in the 1620s, Prey Nôkôr was gradually settled by Vietnamese refugees fleeing the [[Trịnh–Nguyễn War]] further to the north. In 1623, Khmer king [[Chey Chettha II]] (1618–1628) allowed the Vietnamese to settle in the area, which they colloquially referred to as ''Sài Gòn'', and to set up a [[custom house]] at Prey Nôkôr.&lt;ref name="nghiamvo-1623"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sacei07.org/women10.jsp|title=The Women of Vietnam|series=Saigon Arts, Culture &amp; Education Institute Forum|author1=Nghia M. Vo |author2=Chat V. Dang |author3=Hien V. Ho |publisher=Outskirts Press|date=2008-08-29|isbn=1-4327-2208-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers which followed overwhelmed the Khmer kingdom—weakened as it was due to war with Thailand—and slowly Vietnamized the area. Upon capturing the city during the [[Cochinchina Campaign]] in 1859, the French officially westernized the city's traditional name into "Saigon" ({{lang-fr|Saïgon|links=no}}).&lt;ref name="salkin-96-354"&gt;{{cite book|title=Asia and Oceania|series=International Dictionary of Historic Places|volume=5|page=354|author1=Robert M. Salkin |author2=Trudy Ring |editor1=Paul E. Schellinger |editor2=Robert M. Salkin |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the time of original Vietnamese settlement, the informal name of ''Sài Gòn'' has remained in daily speech; apart from official matters, it is still the most common way to refer to the city inside Vietnam, despite an official name change after the end of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1975. ''Sài Gòn'' is still used to refer to the central district, [[District 1, Ho Chi Minh City|District 1]].&lt;ref name="salkin-96-353" /&gt; [[Saigon Railway Station|Sài Gòn Railway Station]] in [[District 3, Ho Chi Minh City|District 3]], the main railway station serving the city, retains the name. The name is also found in company names, book titles and even on airport departure boards: the [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] code for [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport|Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport]] is SGN.&lt;ref name="theairdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theairdb.com/airport/SGN.html|title=Ho Chi Minh City, Tan Son Nhat (SGN)|publisher=theAirDB.com|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is much debate about the origins of the name, the etymology of which is analyzed below. The Vietnamese most often write the name as ''Sài Gòn'', in two words, following the traditional convention in Vietnamese spelling. Some, however, exceptionally write the name of the city as "SaiGon" or "Saigon" in order to save space or give the name a more Westernized look.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==== Etymology ====
[[File:Kapok tree Honolulu.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''Sài Gòn'' may refer to the [[Kapok tree|kapok]] (''bông gòn'') trees that are common around [[Ho Chi Minh City]].]]
;Sino-Vietnamese etymology
A frequently heard, and reasonable, explanation is that Sài is a Chinese [[loanword]] ({{zh|[[wikt:柴|柴]]}}, pronounced chái in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]) meaning “firewood, lops, twigs; palisade”, while Gòn is another Chinese loanword (Chinese: [[wikt:棍|棍]], pronounced gùn in Mandarin) meaning “stick, pole, bole”, and whose meaning evolved into “cotton” in Vietnamese (''bông gòn'', literally “cotton stick”, i.e., “cotton plant”, then shortened to ''gòn'').&lt;ref name="TruongVinhKy"&gt;[[Truong Vinh Ky]], ''Souvenirs historiques sur Saigon et ses environs'', trong ''Excursions et Reconnaissance X. Saigon, Imprimerie Coloniale 1885''&lt;/ref&gt;

This name may have originated from the many cotton ([[Kapok tree|kapok]]) plants that the [[Khmer people]] had planted around Prey Nôkôr, and which can still be seen at Cây Mai temple and surrounding areas.&lt;ref name="TruongVinhKy"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="ouatiers"&gt;"Saigon, signifieraient bois des ouatiers, contenant ainsi une allysion aux nombreux kapokiers qui se rencontraient, parait-il, autregois dans la région. [...] Lê Van Phát avait cru pouvoir pousser cette interprétation très loin, et en déduire que là Plaine des Tombeaux avait été jadis une forêt inépuisable. [...] Sài Gòn pouvait être dérivé du nom cambodgien Prei Kor qui signigie fores des kapokiers ''(sic)''. Il pouvait être aussi l'adaptation des mots siamois Cai-ngon, c'est-àdire brousse des kapokiers, que les Laotiens emploient encore, affirmait-il, pour désigner la capitale de la Cochinchine." {{cite book|title=Tuyển tập Vương Hồng Sến|url=https://www.scribd.com/Lich-Su-Thu-Do-Sai-Gon/d/7230907|author1=Hồng Sến Vương|author2=Q. Thắng Nguyễn|publisher=Nhà xuất bản Văn học|year=2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505043006/http://www.scribd.com/Lich-Su-Thu-Do-Sai-Gon/d/7230907|archivedate=2010-05-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation is that the etymological meaning “twigs” (''sài'') and “boles” (''gòn'') refers to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In Chinese, the city is referred to as [[wikt:西|西]][[wikt:貢|貢]] (a transcription of the Vietnamese name), pronounced ''Sāigung'' in Cantonese, ''Sai-kòng'' in Teochew and ''Xīgòng'' in Mandarin.

;Cantonese etymology
Another reasonable etymology was offered by Vương Hồng Sển, a Vietnamese scholar in the early 20th century, who asserted that ''Sài Gòn'' had its origin in the [[Cantonese]] name of [[Cholon]] (Vietnamese: [[quoc ngu]] Chợ Lớn; [[chữ nôm]] [[File:Cholon.png|30px]]) , the Chinese district of Saigon. The Cantonese (and original) name of Cholon is "Tai-Ngon" ([[wikt:堤|堤]][[wikt:岸|岸]]), which means "embankment" (French: ''quais''). The theory posits that "Sài Gòn" derives from "Tai-Ngon".&lt;ref group="nb" name="vhs-taingon"&gt;"Un siècle plus tard (1773), la révolte des TÁYON ''(sic)'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[qu’éclata]&lt;/nowiki&gt; tout, d’abord dans les montagnes de la province de Qui-Nhon, et s’étendit repidement dans le sud, chassa de Bien-Hoa le mouvement commercial qu’y avaient attiré les Chinois. Ceux-ci abandonnèrent Cou-lao-pho, remontèrent de fleuve de Tan-Binh, et vinrent choisir la position actuele de CHOLEN. Cette création date d’envinron 1778. Ils appelèrent leur nouvelle résidence TAI-NGON ou TIN-GAN. Le nom transformé par les Annamites en celui de SAIGON fut depuis appliqué à tort, par l’expédition francaise, au SAIGON actuel dont la dénomination locale est BEN-NGHE ou BEN-THANH." Francis Garnier, quoted in: {{cite book|title=Tuyển tập Vương Hồng Sến|author1=Hồng Sến Vương|author2=Q. Thắng Nguyễn|url=https://www.scribd.com/Lich-Su-Thu-Do-Sai-Gon/d/7230907|publisher=Nhà xuất bản Văn học|year=2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505043006/http://www.scribd.com/Lich-Su-Thu-Do-Sai-Gon/d/7230907|archivedate=2010-05-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Thai etymology
According to Lê Van Phát, a Vietnamese military officer, a similar source for the name may have developed from the Thai words ''Cai-ngon'', meaning "cotton bush" or "cotton plant". Lê stated that [[Lao people|Laotians]] refer to Saigon as "Cai-ngon".&lt;ref group="nb" name="ouatiers" /&gt;

;Khmer etymology
Another etymology often proposed, although held now as a least-likely etymology, is that “Saigon” comes from “Sai Côn”, which would be the [[transliteration]] of the Khmer word, ''Prey Nôkôr'' ({{lang-km|ព្រៃនគរ}}), meaning "forest city" or "forest kingdom",&lt;ref group="nb" name="warhope-sihanouk" /&gt; or ''Prey Kôr'', meaning "forest of kapok trees".&lt;ref group="nb" name="ouatiers" /&gt;

This Khmer etymology theory is quite interesting, given the Khmer context that existed when the first Vietnamese settlers arrived in the region. However, it fails to completely explain how Khmer “''prey''” led to Vietnamese "sài", since these two syllables appear phonetically quite distinct and as the least reasonable and least likely candidate from the Khmer etymology.

;Cham etymology
The Khmer etymology is considered to be the least likely candidate above because of the complex onset of "Prey" as opposed to the simple onset of "Sài". Furthermore, there is voice distinction between the onsets of "kôr" and "gòn", not to mention syllabic syncope of the [no] in "Nôkôr" without the accompanying tone rise as normally occurs during monosyllabification in Southeast Asian tone languages (Thurgood, 1992; Thurgood and Li, 2002). However, if the word passed directly from Cham into Vietnamese without a Khmer intermediary stage, the complex onset, apocope and voice distinctions would be eliminated. Furthermore, the [au]~[o] alternation is well established in Vietnamese, and is still active today. For example, "không" as [χomɰ] or [χawmɰ] meaning "no" is not dialectal according to region, but is used in free variation throughout present day Ho Chi Minh City (Lopez, 2010). Therefore, the historical chronology given by Nghia M. Vo&lt;ref&gt;Nghia M. Vo (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0oeEpKDCmV4C&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;ots=u66wKiTzO7&amp;dq=The%20Viet%20Kieu%20in%20America%3A%20Personal%20Accounts%20of%20Postwar%20Immigrants%20from%20Vietnam%20By%20Nghia%20M.%20Vo&amp;pg=218#v=onepage&amp;f=false ''The Viet Kieu in America: Personal Accounts of Postwar Immigrants from Vietnam'']. McFarland &amp; Co.. p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; is corroborated by linguistic evidence as NPD (Normal Phonological Development) would lead to the Cham name of Bai Gaur being adopted into Vietnamese as "Sài Gòn". The nasalization of coda sonorants such as [r] to [n] is well established in Vietnamese, and serves as a strong indication of Vietnamese "Sài Gòn" and Khmer "Prey Nôkôr" as doublets of a Cham original. Analogy usually postdates the etymological source, such as in the morphism of "Gaur" into "Nôkôr" by analogy with the Sanskrit "Nagara" as well as in the imaginative but highly speculatory attributions given above alleging Sinitic etymologies in a Southeast Asian context. Further ethnolinguistic and historical linguistic studies on this subject are currently underway. (Lopez, 2011)

=== Gia Định ===
The name of Prey Nôkôr, along with Cambodia's rule over the area, remained until the 1690s, when [[Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh]], a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyen rulers of [[Huế]] to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the Mekong Delta and its surroundings. This act formally detached the area from Cambodia, which found itself too weak to intervene due to its ongoing conflict with Thailand. Prey Nôkôr was officially renamed ''Gia Định'' ([[chữ nôm]]: [[wikt:嘉|嘉]][[wikt:定|定]]), and the region was placed firmly under Vietnamese administrative control. With the city's capture by the French in 1859, the name ''Gia Định'' was discarded and replaced by the name "Saigon", which had always been the popular name.&lt;ref name="salkin-96-354"/&gt; Most [[sinitic]] maps were not updated to use the newer name until at least 1891, with the name of the city written as [[wikt:嘉|嘉]][[wikt:定|定]] until then.&lt;ref name="mapofvietnam1891"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/226/zoom.html|title=Comprehensive Map of Vietnam’s Provinces|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|work=World Digital Library|year=1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Etymology ====
The origin of the name ''Gia Định'' has not been firmly established. One possible etymology may relate to the [[Chinese characters]] used to spell the name in Chữ Nôm: [[wikt:嘉|嘉]], which means "joyful", "auspicious", or "pretty", and [[wikt:定|定]], which means "decide" or "pacify". Another possible etymology, based on the fact that [[Malay language|Malay]] speakers existed in the region during the era of Vietnamese settlement, relates the name to the Malay words ''ya dingin'' or ''ya hering'', meaning "cool and cold" or "cold and clear", respectively—perhaps referring to the appearance of the area's many waterways.&lt;ref name="cbwook04"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foZAdRgB-nwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=xfkjUciisR&amp;dq=Southern%20Vietnam%20under%20the%20reign%20of%20Minh%20M%E1%BA%A1ng&amp;pg=20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Southern Vietnam under the reign of Minh Mạng (1820-1841): Central Policies and Local Response|author=Choi Byung Wook|publisher=Cornell University Southeast Asia Program|isbn=0-87727-138-0|year=2004|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh ===
On July 2, 1976, upon the formal establishment of the modern-day [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]], the new government [[Geographical renaming|renamed the city]] after [[Ho Chi Minh|Hồ Chí Minh]], the first leader of [[North Vietnam]].&lt;ref group="nb" name="hcm-pc"&gt;The text of the resolution is as follows:

"By the National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 6th tenure, 1st session, for officially renaming Saigon-Gia Dinh City as Ho Chi Minh City.
The National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam
Considering the boundless love of the people of Saigon-Gia Dinh City for President Ho Chi Minh and their wish for the city to be named after him;
Considering the long and difficult revolutionary struggle launched in Saigon-Gia Dinh City, with several glorious feats, deserves the honor of being named after President Ho Chi Minh;
After discussing the suggestion of the Presidium of the National Assembly’s meeting;
Decides to rename Saigon-Gia Dinh City as Ho Chi Minh City."

The official name is now ''Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh''; ''Thành phố'' is the Vietnamese word for "city". In [[English language|English]], this is translated as ''Ho Chi Minh City''; in [[French language|French]] it is translated as ''Hô-Chi-Minh-Ville'' (the [[circumflex]] and [[hyphen]]s are sometimes omitted). Due to its length, the name is often abbreviated or made into an [[acronym]]; "Tp. HCM" and the acronym "TPHCM" are used interchangeably in the original [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], along with "HCM City" or "HCMC" in English and "HCMV" in French.&lt;ref group="nb" name="hcm-web"&gt;The [http://www.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/default.aspx official website] of [[Ho Chi Minh City]] uses both "TP HCM" and "TPHCM" in Vietnamese, and uses mainly "HCM City" in English, though many linked articles ([http://www.eng.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/eng/news/default.aspx?cat_id=0&amp;news_id=9595#content example 1], [http://www.eng.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/eng/news/default.aspx?cat_id=0&amp;news_id=9020#content example 2]) use "HCMC". The French acronym "HCMV" is less common, although it is used on the [http://www.consulfrance-hcm.org/article.php3?id_article=1035 official website] of the French consulate in Ho Chi Minh City.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Etymology ====
As noted, the now-official name commemorates [[North Vietnam]]ese leader [[Ho Chi Minh|Hồ Chí Minh]], who, although deceased by the time of the [[Fall of Saigon]], was instrumental in the establishment of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. "Hồ Chí Minh" was not his original name; he was born as Nguyễn Sinh Cung, and only began using the new name around 1940.&lt;ref name="Quinn Judge"&gt;Sophie Quinn-Judge, ''Hồ Chí Minh: The Missing Years'', University of California Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0-520-23533-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name, which he favoured throughout his later years, combines a common Vietnamese surname (Hồ, [[wikt:胡|胡]]) with a given name meaning "enlightened will" (from [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] [[wikt:志|志]][[wikt:明|明]]; Chí meaning 'will' (or spirit), and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning "bringer of light".&lt;ref name="bbc-bacho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/ho_chi_minh.shtml|title=Historic Figures: Ho Chi Minh (1890-1969)|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other names ==
The kingdom of [[Champa]], though mainly based along the coast of the [[South China Sea]], is known to have expanded west into the Mekong Delta.&lt;ref group="nb" name="salkin-96-b"&gt;"Such a trading center was bound to be one of the prizes in the struggle for power that developed in the thirteenth century between the declining Khmer Empire and the expanding kingdom of Champa, and by the end of that century the Cham people had seized control of the town." {{cite book|title=Asia and Oceania|series=International Dictionary of Historic Places|volume=5|page=353|author1=Robert M.

Vo implies that a Cham presence existed in the area prior to Khmer occupation, and that the name ''Baigaur'' was given to the village that would later come to be known as Prey Nokor.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;"Saigon began as the Cham village of Baigaur, then became the Khmer Prey Nôkôr before being taken over by the Vietnamese and renamed Gia Dinh Thanh and then Saigon." {{cite book|title=The Viet Kieu in America: Personal Accounts of Postwar Immigrants from Vietnam|author=Nghia M.

== Controversy ==

=== Khmer nationalism ===
The area now known as [[Ho Chi Minh City]] was part of several historical empires connected to modern-day Cambodia, including [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]], [[Chenla]] and the [[Khmer Empire]].&lt;ref name="salkin-96-353" /&gt; Formal settlements by the Khmers likely date back to the 11th century.&lt;ref group="nb" name="salkin-96" /&gt; In comparison, the first [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] presence in the area dates back to the late 15th century.&lt;ref name="salkin-96-353" /&gt; The gradual encroachment of the Vietnamese onto what were once Khmer lands, culminating in the creation of the unified [[State of Vietnam]] in 1949 and the associated [[cession]] of [[Cochinchina]] (known to the [[Khmer people|Khmers]] as ''Kampuchea Krom'', or "Lower [[Cambodia]]") to Vietnam has resulted in significant bitterness directed towards the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] on the part of the Khmers. As a result, many of those who consider themselves Khmer nationalists would refer to Ho Chi Minh City as ''Prey Nôkôr'', a reference to its former status as a Khmer port city.&lt;ref name="soeung-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondintractability.org/reflections/personal_reflections/khmer_nationalism_and_peacebuilding.jsp?nid=6810|title=A Personal Struggle to Balance Khmer Nationalism and Peacebuilding|author=Sophat Soeung|date=March 2008|publisher=The Beyond Intractability Knowledge Base Project|accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overseas Vietnamese ===
Of the about 3 million [[Overseas Vietnamese]], a majority left Vietnam as political refugees after 1975 as a result of the [[Fall of Saigon]] and the resulting takeover by the Communist regime, taking up residence in North America, Western Europe, and Australia. The majority are opposed to the existing government of Vietnam,&lt;ref name=hardy&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M49D0SRTM24C&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=vietnamese+diaspora&amp;ei=0WfCSvn8BZ_4lASv5PS2Aw#v=onepage&amp;q=vietnamese%20diaspora&amp;f=false|chapter=Internal transnationalism and the formation of the Vietnamese diaspora|title=State/nation/transnation: perspectives on transnationalism in the Asia-Pacific|author=Andrew Hardy|editor1=Brenda S.

'''Naomi Zack''' is a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Oregon]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |title=Naomi Zack {{!}} Department of Philosophy |url= http://philosophy.uoregon.edu/profile/nzack/ |publisher= University of Oregon |accessdate= 30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a prolific author, having published seven books in addition to a large number of papers and contributed chapters in feminist ethics, particularly in areas having to deal with race or disaster.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; Zack has taken on a number of professional roles related to the representation of women and other under-represented groups in philosophy.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; Zack is also a member of the editorial boards of multiple journals, including ''[[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy]]'', ''The Journal of Race and Policy'', ''Ethnic Studies: an Interdisciplinary Journal of Culture, Race and Ethnicity'', and the ''[[Radical Philosophical Review]]''.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Education and career==
Zack received her bachelor's degree from [[New York University]] in 1966, and received a doctorate from [[Columbia University]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; She served as an adjunct assistant professor of philosophy at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] for the 1990-91 school year, and accepted an appointment as an assistant professor of philosophy at the [[University of Albany]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; She accepted an appointment as an affiliated member in the Department of Women's Studies at the [[University of Albany]] in 1993, and was promoted to Associate Professor of Philosophy in 1998.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  She was promoted to full professor for the 2000-1 school year (while she also served as the Director of the Doctor of Arts in Humanistic Studies Program), before accepting a position as Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Oregon]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Research areas and publications==
Zack's research has ranged broadly over such fields as [[critical race theory|philosophy of race]], [[Identity (philosophy)|philosophy of identity]], [[feminist theory]], and the [[history of philosophy]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;  Zack has published five academic books: ''Race and Mixed Race'' in 1993, ''Bachelors of Science: Seventeenth Century Identity, Then and Now'' in 1996, ''Philosophy of Science and Race'' in 2002, and ''Inclusive Feminism: A Theory for the Third Wave'' in 2009.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web |last= Zack |first=Naomi |title= Curriculum Vitae |url= https://casadmin.uoregon.edu/profile/sites/casadmin.uoregon.edu.profile/files/cv/cv-595.pdf |publisher= University of Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; She's also published one textbook, ''Thinking About Race'', in 1998, and one pop philosophy book, ''The Handy Philosophy Answer Book,'' in 2010.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

In ''Ethics for Disaster'', Zack examined the social construction of disasters and attempted to produce a model of disasters and a cohesive set of "[[disaster ethics]]."&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;&lt;ref name=d1/&gt; Zack assumes an optimistic view of the [[social contract]].&lt;ref name=d1/&gt;  Zack views governments not only as having an obligation to step in and assist after disaster has occurred, but also as having a positive obligation to plan for how to respond to likely types of disasters in advance.  Zack views governments not as having an ethical obligation to provide their citizenry with the best assistance they can during a disaster scenario, but as having an obligation to provide them with the best assistance that the government ''could have potentially planned for.''&lt;ref name=d1&gt;{{cite journal |last= Elliott |first= James R |title= Building the Road Ahead: From 'Ethics for Disaster' to 'Obligation from Disaster' |journal= Review Journal of Political Philosophy |year= 2010 |volume=8 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zack also goes to great lengths to highlight the differences in how "disasters" are portrayed depending on the political, racial, and socio-economic class to which they occur.&lt;ref name=d2&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lawson |first= Bill E |title= Zack, Race, and the Language of Disasters |journal= Review Journal of Political Philosophy |date=January 1, 2010 |volume=8 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[National Address Gazetteer infrastructure]]''' is a database designed to provide a definitive source of publicly owned spatial address data for Great Britain. It is a culmination of Local Land and Property Gazetteers (collectively known as the [[National Land and Property Gazetteer]] (NLPG)) and other datasets: [[OS MasterMap|Address Layer 2 (AL2)]] and Royal Mail [[Postcode Address File|PAF]] data. The LLPGs, which make up a portion of the data, are created and maintained with input from all [[local government|local authorities]] in England and Wales.

Following the setting up of GeoPlace, NLPG data has been brought together with Ordnance Survey, Valuation Office Agency and Royal Mail data into the National Address Gazetteer infrastructure. The National Address Gazetteer infrastructure is the single source from which the AddressBase products from Ordnance Survey are developed. Through agreement between Ordnance Survey and Scotland’s Improvement Service, working on behalf of Scottish Local Government, the National Address Gazetteer includes Scottish address data.

[[GeoPlace]] is an organisation (LLP) that oversees the production and maintenance of the National Address Gazetteer.  GeoPlace is joint owned by the Local Government Association and Ordnance Survey.

==History==
At the creation of the National Address Gazetteer in autumn 2011, the dataset only included spatial address data for England and Wales. However, through agreement with Scotland's Improvement Service Company, coverage is extended to include Scotland.

[[File:FMIB 43953 Bahama Archipelago.jpeg|thumb|290px|Navidad Bank in the lower right corner of an 1873 map of the Bahamas.]]
'''Navidad Bank''' ({{lang-es|Banco de la Navidad}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmarcano.com/ecohis/areas/categoria1/bancos.html Áreas protegidas de la República Dominicana - Santuario de los Bancos de la Plata y de la Navidad]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[submerged bank]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] north of the [[Dominican Republic]] and southeast of the Territory of [[Turks &amp; Caicos]]. It is separated from [[Silver Bank]] by the wide Navidad Bank Passage.

==Geography==
The bank is a shallow underwater area composed of coral and sand that almost reaches the ocean's surface, but is wholly submerged. It covers an area of {{convert|650|km²|0|abbr=on}}. At low tide, a few small locations appear awash at the water's surface. General depths are less than {{convert|36.6|m|1|abbr=off}}. There is a least known depth of {{convert|12.8|m|1|abbr=off}} located on the east side of the north end of the bank. It is not suitable for boating navigation of any kind, except by small craft, whose operators must be extremely careful. From the earliest colonial times, the Navidad Bank has been the scene of various [[shipwreck]]s.

This area is considered part of the Dominican Republic. A Dominican presidential decree on July 5, 1996, included the area as part of the [[Sanctuary for the Marine Mammals of the Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20161025195726/http://www.ambiente.gob.do/ambienterd/eco-parque/reserva-cientifica-santuario-de-mamiferos-marinos-bancos-de-la-plata-y-navidad/ Reserva Cientifica Santuario de Mamiferos Marinos Bancos Bancos de la Plata y Navidad]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Navidad Bank has a wealth of [[coral]]s and is a safe haven for marine mammals, including the [[humpback whale]]. The humpback whales have long used the Bank as a breeding and calving ground.

As such, tourism focuses on tours to view the whales and other sea life.  The Bank is visited by scuba divers.

Just to the northwest is the [[Silver Bank]] ({{lang-es|Banco de la Plata}}), also under the jurisdiction of the Dominican Republic.

The Navidad Bank, the [[Silver Bank]], as well as the [[Mouchoir Bank]] further northwest, plus the Turks and Caicos Islands, are geographically considered a continuation of [[Lucayan Archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carew|first1=James|last2=Mylroie|first2=John|editor1-last=Vacher|editor1-first=H.L.|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=T.|title=Geology of Bahamas, in Geology and Hydrology of Carbonate Islands, Developments in Sedimentology 54|date=1997|publisher=Elsevier Science B.V.|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780444516442|pages=91-139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Seahorse''' is a marine conservation organization committed to the conservation and sustainable use of coastal marine ecosystems in general, and seahorses in particular.

==Operations==

[[File:Researcher studying seahorses underwater.jpg|thumb|left|A Project Seahorse Researcher studying a seahorse underwater.]]

By working to protect [[seahorses]], Project Seahorse supports marine conservation more broadly. These fish are affected by similar environmental and over-fishing pressures as all marine organisms, and benefit from similar conservation measures.  The organization's work focuses on not just biological seahorse research,  but  marine fish populations, ecosystems, fishing communities, national and global trade issues, and policy and public outreach.

It was founded in 1996 by the seahorse researchers [[Amanda Vincent]] and [[Heather Koldewey]]. Today, Vincent is the Director,  Koldewey  the   Associate Director, and there are about 35 team members.  Field work began in the Philippine community of Handumon on Jandayan Island off the northern tip of [[Bohol]], and has expanded to  Europe, Central America, east and southeast Asia, Africa, and North America. Project Seahorse is the [[IUCN Red List]] authority on seahorses and their related species.

The project works in cooperation with the [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] at the [[University of British Columbia]], where Vincent holds a Canada Research Chair in Marine Conservation; the [[Zoological Society of London]], where Koldewey is Head of Global Programmes; the [[John G. Shedd Aquarium]]; and the [[TRAFFIC]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ProjectSeahorse.org|url=http://seahorse.fisheries.ubc.ca/who-we-are/history|work=History|accessdate=20 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902134139/http://seahorse.fisheries.ubc.ca/who-we-are/history#|archive-date=2011-09-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the project published a history of its first decade, [http://seahorse.fisheries.ubc.ca/sites/seahorse.fisheries.ubc.ca/files/documents/news/uploads/ProjectSeahorse10years.pdf Project Seahorse at 10]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

==Research==
Researchers study the biology, distribution, ecology, habitat, and population numbers of seahorse species around the world. 
Species researched include these:
* [[Dwarf seahorse]]
* [[Great seahorse]]
* [[Japanese seahorse]]
* [[Lined seahorse]]
* [[Pacific seahorse]]
* [[Pygmy seahorse]]s
* [[Slender seahorse]]
* [[Spiny seahorse]]
* [[West African seahorse]]

== Achievements ==

In the Philippines, the project has established 34 locally managed marine protected areas in the Philippines, and encouraged an alliance of 1,000 families of small-scale fishers,  KAMADA, active in establishment of marine reserves and enforcement against illegal fishing.&lt;ref&gt;"Philippine Seahorses fall victim to overfishing" Philippine Center For Investigative Journalism, 1999 [http://pcij.org/stories/1999/seahorse.html]&lt;/ref&gt;   The project has obtained  an agreement  under [[CITES]], the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, to limit export of seahorses to sustainable levels,   the first global export controls under ([[CITES]]  for any commercially important marine fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guylian.com|url=http://www.guylian.com/en/project-seahorse/about-project-seahorse/|work=About Project Seahorse|publisher=Guylian Belgian Chocolate|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Protected areas of Brazil''' included various classes of area according to the National System of Conservation Units (SNUC), a formal, unified system for federal, state and municipal parks created in 2000.

==Types of protected area==
[[File:Passeio de barco ao cânion do Xingó -Rio São Francisco 02.jpg|thumb|Canyon in the [[Rio São Francisco Natural Monument]] ]]
Protected areas, also called conservation units, are divided into different categories according to their goals.
These are defined by Law No. 9.985 of 18 July 2000, which established the National System of Conservation Units (SNUC).
Objectives include conservation of nature, sustainable development, scientific research, education and eco-tourism,
Fully protected units are expected to maintain the natural ecosystem without human interference.
Sustainable use units allow sustained use of renewable environmental resources while maintaining biodiversity and other ecological attributes.{{sfn|Áreas protegidas – Apremavi}}
The [[Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation]], which administers Federal units, defines the fully protected (''proteção integral'') classes of unit as:{{sfn|Categorias – Chico Mendes}}

*[[Ecological station (Brazil)|Ecological stations]] ({{lang-pt|Estações Ecológicas}})
*[[Biological reserve (Brazil)|Biological reserves]] ({{lang-pt|Reservas Biológicas}})
*[[National park (Brazil)|National parks]] ({{lang-pt|Parques nacionais}}), [[State park (Brazil)|State parks]] ({{lang-pt|Parques estaduais}}) and [[Municipal nature park (Brazil)|Municipal nature parks]] ({{lang-pt|Parques naturais municipais}})
*[[Natural monument (Brazil)|Natural monuments]] ({{lang-pt|Monumentos Naturais}})
*[[Wildlife refuge (Brazil)|Wildlife refuges]] ({{lang-pt|Refúgios de Vida Silvestre}})

[[File:Vale dos Dinossauros na cidade de Souza sertão da Paraíba Brasil.jpg|thumb|Fossilised tracks in the [[Valley of the Dinosaurs, Paraíba]] ]]
The sustainable use units are:{{sfn|Categorias – Chico Mendes}}

*[[Environmental protection area (Brazil)|Environmental protection areas]] ({{lang-pt|Áreas de Proteção Ambiental}})
*[[Area of relevant ecological interest (Brazil)|Areas of relevant ecological interest]] ({{lang-pt|Áreas de Relevante Interesse Ecológico}})
*[[National forest (Brazil)|National forests]] ({{lang-pt|Florestas Nacionais}}) and [[State forest (Brazil)|State forests]] ({{lang-pt|Florestas Estaduais}})
*[[Extractive reserve (Brazil)|Extractive reserves]] ({{lang-pt|Reservas Extrativistas}})
*[[Wildlife reserve (Brazil)|Wildlife reserves]] ({{lang-pt|Reservas de Fauna}})
*[[Sustainable development reserve (Brazil)|Sustainable development reserve]]s ({{lang-pt|Reservas de Desenvolvimento Sustentável}})
*[[Private natural heritage reserve (Brazil)|Private natural heritage reserves]] ({{lang-pt|Reservas Particular do Patrimônio Natural}})

In addition, some states designate areas as [[Ecological reserve (Brazil)|ecological reserve]] ({{lang-pt|Reserva Ecológica}}).

Although not technically protected areas, [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territories]] ({{lang-pt|Terras Indígenas}}) give the indigenous people full rights over the area, and serve as an obstacle to deforestation, mining and large-scale agriculture. As of 2016 there were 700 Indigenous Territories in Brazil, covering about 13.8%% of the country's land area. 
Most of them were in the Amazon Legal.{{sfn|Indigenous Lands – Location and extension – ISA}}

==Mosaics and corridors==
[[File:Casa de pescadores - Rio São Francisco.JPG|thumb|Fishing houses in the [[Piaçabuçu Environmental Protection Area]] ]]
The SNUC law defines a [[Protected area mosaic (Brazil)|protected area mosaic]] as a collection of protected areas of the same or different categories that are near to each other, adjoining each other or overlapping, and that should be managed as a whole. 
Given the different categories of conservation unit and other protected areas in a mosaic, the different conservation goals must be considered.{{sfn|Mosaicos de áreas protegidas – ISA}}
In addition to fully protected and sustainable use conservation units a mosaic may include private lands and indigenous territories.{{sfn|Mosaicos de áreas protegidas – ISA}}

The SNUC law also recognises [[Ecological corridor (Brazil)|ecological corridor]]s as portions of natural or semi-natural ecosystems linking protected areas that allow gene flow and movement of biota, recolonization of degraded areas and maintenance of viable populations larger than would be possible with individual units.
The federal Ecological Corridor Project has its roots at least as far back as 1993.
It has identified seven major corridors, with focus on implementing and learning from the [[Central Amazon Corridor]] and the Central Atlantic Forest Corridor.{{sfn|Corredor ecológico – ISA}}

==Degree of coverage==

As of 2004 federally-administered conservation units covered 7.23% of Brazilian territory, below the level of 10% recommended by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].{{sfn|Barbosa Monteiro|Soares do Prado|Dias|2009|p=14}}
Federal coverage was:{{sfn|Barbosa Monteiro|Soares do Prado|Dias|2009|p=15}}
{|class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:right;"
|-
!Type !! Protected area (ha) !! Total area (ha) !! Percentage&lt;br/&gt;Protected
|-
| Fully protected || 28,147,214.93 || 854,546,635.67 || 3.29%
|-
| Sustainable use || 33,663,938.75 || 854,546,635.67 || 3.94%
|-
|totals || 61,811,153.68 || 854,546,635.67 || 7.23%
|}
Levels of protection vary considerably depending on the [[biome]]. Federal coverage as of 2005 was:{{sfn|Barbosa Monteiro|Soares do Prado|Dias|2009|p=15}}
{|class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:right;"
|-
!Biome !! Total area (km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) !! Percentage&lt;br/&gt;Protected
|-
|style="text-align:left;"| [[Amazon biome|Amazon]] || 4,239,000 || 13.40%
|-
|style="text-align:left;"| [[Cerrado]] || 2,116,000 || 4.10%
|-
|style="text-align:left;"| [[Atlantic Forest]] || 1,.076,000 || 2.01%
|-
|style="text-align:left;"| [[Pantanal]] || 142,500 || 1.10%
|-
|style="text-align:left;"| [[Caatinga]] || 736,800 || 0.91%
|}
Protected areas are subject to reduction, reclassification or declassification (RRD). 
Between 1981 and 2010 an area of {{convert|45000000|ha}} was downgraded or lost in this way, with almost 70% of cases occurring since 2008.
The main cause was making land available for hydroelectric dams in the Amazon region.
Other reasons were property speculation and agribusiness.{{sfn|Bruno Deiro|Herton Escobar|2012}}

The '''relief ratio''' is a number calculated to describe the [[Grade (slope)|grade]] of a [[river]] or [[stream]].

The calculation is just the difference in [[elevation]] between the river's [[source (river or stream)|source]] and the river's [[confluence (geography)|confluence]] or [[river delta|mouth]] divided by the total [[length]] of the river or stream. This gives the average drop in elevation per unit length of river.&lt;ref name="Streams II"&gt;

'''Section lines''' in the [[United States]] are one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) apart. When surveyors originally mapped an area, for instance a [[Survey township|township]], it was their custom to divide the new township into 36 {{convert|1|sqmi|km2|adj=mid| [[Section (United States land surveying)|sections]]}}. Property ownership often followed this layout. A section is a {{nowrap|1-by-}}{{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} area. A half section is a 1/2-mile by {{nowrap|1-mile}} area. It is proper to continue this division down to a 1/4-by-1/4 section which is 1/16 of a section, or {{convert|40|acre|ha}}. The next smaller division is {{convert|10|acre|ha}}, and then {{convert|2.5|acre|m2}}. Besides property ownership, roads called [[section line road]]s often followed the section lines, and one can often still see them in modern maps, even in urban areas. In rural areas, these roads are called section roads, and often exist primarily so that farmers can access their land.

A '''space force''' is a [[military branch]] that conducts [[space warfare]]. Currently, one [[Sovereign state|country]] has previously had an independent space force. The [[Russian Space Forces]] was an independent organization that existed from 1992 to 1997 and from 2001 to 2011; it was reestablished in 2015 as a branch of the [[Russian Aerospace Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2018/06/21/as-trump-pushes-for-separate-space-force-russia-moves-fast-the-other-way/|title=As Trump pushes for separate space force, Russia moves fast the other way|first=Matthew|last=Bodner|date=22 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A space force is almost always a part of the [[air force]], which may function as an air and space force or as an aerospace force, as the [[United States Air Force]] does.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.afspc.af.mil/About-Us/ About Us]".

'''Squaw's Tit''' is an outlier of Mount Charles Stewart in the [[Canadian Rockies]] of [[Alberta]]. It is located at Lat/Lon: 51.13°N, 115.33°W and is one of the most prominent landmarks in the vicinity of [[Canmore, Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dowclimbing.com/SquawsTit.html&lt;/ref&gt;

"Squaw's Tit" is an unofficial name for the high point of a ridge that lies southwest of the [[Mount Charles Stewart]] summit and northwest of [[Mount Lady Macdonald]] near [[Canmore, Alberta|Canmore]]. The peak owes its name to the resemblance it shares with a woman's upturned [[breast]]. Due to its [[politically incorrect]] name, it is unlikely to receive official status{{according to|date=January 2016}}, but is in common use.

Belonging to the [[Fairholme Range]] in [[Peter Lougheed Provincial Park|Kananaskis Provincial Park]], Squaw's Tit is located {{convert|4000|ft}} above the [[Bow River]] valley. It is {{convert|2|km}} northwest of Lady Macdonald, just east of the [[Banff National Park]] gates.

==Routes==
The scrambling route is graded moderate but includes exposure and thus is strongly recommended that the ascent only be done in dry conditions. Follow the major drainage ditch behind Harvey Heights and stay close along the right (south) side of the ditch. Follow this up to the North West ridge all the way to the slabs just below the protruding summit nipple.

'''Sylhet''' ({{lang-bn|সিলেট}}, {{lang-syl|ꠍꠤꠟꠐ}}) is a geographical and cultural region in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent and comprises the [[Sylhet Division]] in [[Bangladesh]], which includes the [[Sylhet District|Surma Valley]], and the three districts of the [[Barak Valley]] in [[Assam]], [[India]]. Among these three districts, North Cachar belonged to the [[Kachari Kingdom]] before the [[British Raj]] now Dima Hasao rules here, whereas Karimganj and Hailakandi belonged to the [[Sylhet district]] of then Bengal. Karimganj was separated from [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]] after the 1947 referendum, with the rest of Sylhet falling under [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]) and Karimganj under India. In 1947, when a [[Sylhet referendum, 1947|plebiscite]] was held in [[Sylhet]], the region was divided into two; the eastern part of [[Sylhet]] which is known as [[Barak Valley]] remained with [[India]] whereas the other part fell under [[East Pakistan]]. Geographically the region is surrounded by hills from all three sides except its western plain boundary with Bangladesh. Nihar Ranjan Roy, author of Bangalir Itihash, says that "South Assam / Northeastern Bengal or Barak Valley is the extension of the Greater Surma/Meghna Valley of [[Bengal]] in every aspect from culture to geography".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IciEHAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Bangalir+Itihas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRgvD4xLXTAhXCJCYKHVLdD_kQ6AEIJDAA|title=Bangalir itihas|last=Ray|first=Niharranjan|date=1980-01-01|publisher=Paschimbanga Samiti|language=bn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5275">'''Syngas fermentation''', also known as '''synthesis gas fermentation''', is a microbial process.  In this process, a mixture of [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], and [[carbon dioxide]], known as [[syngas]], is used as [[carbon]] and [[energy]] sources, and then converted into [[fuel]] and [[chemicals]] by [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The main products of syngas [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] include [[ethanol]], [[butanol]], [[acetic acid]], [[butyric acid]], and [[methane]].&lt;ref name="Worden"&gt;Worden, R.M., Bredwell, M.D., and Grethlein, A.J. (1997). Engineering issues in synthesis gas fermentations, Fuels and Chemicals from Biomass. Washington, DC: American Chemical Society, 321-335&lt;/ref&gt;
Certain industrial processes, such as petroleum refining, steel milling, and methods for producing [[carbon black]], [[Petroleum coke|coke]], [[ammonia]], and [[methanol]], discharge enormous amounts of waste gases containing mainly CO and {{chem|H|2}} into the atmosphere either directly or through combustion. Biocatalysts can be exploited to convert these waste gases to chemicals and fuels as, for example, ethanol.&lt;ref name="Abubackar"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/bbb.256 | last1 = Abubackar | first1 = H.N. | last2 = Veiga | first2 = M.

There are several microorganisms, which can produce fuels and chemicals by syngas utilization.

Syngas fermentation process has advantages over a [[chemical process]] since it takes places at lower [[temperature]] and [[pressure]], has higher [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] [[Chemical specificity|specificity]], tolerates higher amounts of [[sulfur]] compounds, and does not require a specific ratio of CO to {{chem|H|2}}.&lt;ref name="Worden" /&gt; On the other hand, syngas fermentation has limitations such as:
* Gas-liquid mass transfer limitation&lt;ref name="Henstra"/&gt;
* Low volumetric [[productivity]]
* Inhibition of [[organisms]].&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Worden" /&gt;

Aruba now uses country code [[+297]], and Sint Maarten uses the [[North American Numbering Plan]] (NANP) country code +1 with [[area code 721]].&lt;ref name="Sint Maarten NANP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanpa.com/pdf/PL_418.pdf |title=PL-418: Introduction of NPA 721 (Sint Maarten)|publisher=North American Numbering Plan Administration |date=2011-01-05 |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Area codes ==
Originally each island had an area code each with the length of the local numbering varying from island to island (Curaçao had six while Bonaire had only four), however beginning in 1999, the numbers were modified so that each local number was seven digits long. This change left the islands without any area codes, except for Curaçao, which has the area code of 9 along with the seven digit local number.

On October 2, 2009, the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) announced that it had approved the request of Sint Maarten's government to join the NANP and had assigned the territory [[area code 721]]. Effective September 30, 2011, Sint Maarten's country code changed to the NANP standard of +1. A permissive dialing period of one full year (to September 30, 2012) was in place when both area code 721 and +599 could be used.&lt;ref name="Sint Maarten NANP update"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanpa.com/pdf/PL_423.pdf |title=PL-423: Updated Information - Introduction of NPA 721 (Sint Maarten) |publisher=North American Numbering Plan Administration |date=2011-07-23 |accessdate=2011-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of  +1-721 is now mandatory; a recorded message reminding callers to the +599 numbers to use +1-721 remained active until September 30, 2013.&lt;ref name="Sint Maarten NANP update"/&gt;
