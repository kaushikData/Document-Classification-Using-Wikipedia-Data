The {{nihongo|'''Akashi pedestrian bridge accident'''|明石歩道橋事故|Akashi hodōkyō jiko}} was a human [[stampede]] that occurred on 21 July 2001 in [[Akashi, Hyōgo]], Japan. In the incident, a large crowd of people packed into a partially enclosed pedestrian overpass leading to [[Asagiri Station (Hyōgo)|Asagiri Station]] after a fireworks show. The resulting crush killed 11 people, including two adults and nine children, and injured 247 others. Five civic and security officials were later convicted of professional negligence for not preventing the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120120a2.html Ex-cop pleads not guilty in fatal '01 Akashi crush]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 20 January 2012, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, George, "[http://safercrowds.com/CrowdDisasters.html 2.1 Crowd Disasters] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313234345/http://safercrowds.com/CrowdDisasters.html |date=2012-03-13 }}", Crowd Modelling Ltd., 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], "[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/07/21/national/main302723.shtml Crowd Crush Proves Fatal In Japan]", ''[[CBS News]]'', 11 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20070407a6.html Sentences stand for four in fatal Akashi crush]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 7 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/02/21/national/ex-cop-off-hook-for-akashi-01-fatal-crush/#.USVLh2dy1yI Ex-cop off hook for Akashi ’01 fatal crush]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 21 February 2013, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albanian Canadians''' ({{lang-sq|Shqiptarë Kanadezë}}) are [[Canadians|Canadian citizens]] of [[Albanians|Albanian]] descent or Albanian people who are citizens of [[Canada]]. According to the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census]] there were 28,270 Canadians who claimed Albanian ancestry, an increase compared to the 22,395 in the 2006 Census.&lt;ref name="Albanian Canadians"/&gt;

== History ==
The first Albanians who settled in Canada arrived in the early 20th century, due to internal uprisings that occurred in their country of origin. However, after World War II (1938–1943) very few Albanians moved to Canada, and most arrived from the former Yugoslavia, due to a communist regime in Albania, which prohibited foreign travel. Most Albanians who emigrated to Canada country after the war decided to settle in [[Montreal]] or [[Toronto]]. There were also some Albanian workers who resided in [[Calgary]] and [[Ontario]] (e.g.
[[Peterborough]]).&lt;ref name="Canadian Encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/albanians/ "Albanians"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''. Published by Vladislav A. Tomovic. Retrieved on November 29, 2011, 0:36 pm at.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this migration, by 1986, the number of Albanians was recorded at just under 1,500. However, in 1991, these figures nearly doubled. The number of Albanians in Canada peaked in the late 1990s as they fled economic and political crisis in both Albania and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="Heritage Toronto"&gt;[http://www.heritagetoronto.org/discover-toronto/community-stories/albanians-toronto The Albanians in Toronto] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415035949/http://www.heritagetoronto.org/discover-toronto/community-stories/albanians-toronto |date=2012-04-15 }}. Retrieved on November 29, 2011, 0:36 pm at. Published by Krystyna Cap.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 21st century, a new war prompted a second wave of immigration of Albanians in Canada. This armed conflict was a clash between Albanian and Serb military and police, which caused many Albanians to feel compelled to leave [[Kosovo]] as refugees, many of them emigrating to Canada. Thus, in 1999, the Government of Canada established a residency program to allow 7,000 refugee Kosovar Albanians.&lt;ref name="Canadian Encyclopedia"/&gt;

As with professionals from other countries, there has been a large influx of young Albanian professionals who immigrate to Canada for a better life.

== Demography ==
According to the 2006 census, there were 22,395 people of ethnic Albanian descent living in Canada, most of whom 11,385 (51%) resided in Toronto.&lt;ref name="Canadian Encyclopedia"/&gt; [[Hamilton, Canada|Hamilton]], [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], [[London, Ontario|London]], Ottawa and [[Peterborough]] are areas on the outskirts of Toronto which also have Albanian communities.&lt;ref name="Heritage Toronto"/&gt;

Most socio-cultural activities and festivals represent local communities and family groups. Albanians are very patriarchal and often live in extended family households. Albanian Canadians appreciate their ethnicity, and the national history of their country of origin, although their ancestors may have been gone from Albania for centuries. Albanians work on their business and social organizations, and are often found in the food industry.&lt;ref name="Canadian Encyclopedia"/&gt; Albanians do not come only from Albania and Kosovo, as they come, at least, also from others five different countries: [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. The Albanian-Canadians belong (as the Albanians) to five religious groups – Christian (Orthodox, Catholic and Evangelical) and Muslim (Sunni and Bektashi).&lt;ref name="Heritage Toronto"/&gt;

== Organizations ==
Over the years, Albanian Canadians established many organizations in Canada, to maintain their language, traditions and culture. These association  have also helped other immigrants adapt to Canadian life. Many of these partnerships are in Toronto, a major city of the Albanian population. In this city, the largest associations are the Albanian Muslim Society of Toronto (founded in 1954) and the Albanian-Canadian Community Association of Toronto (founded in 1990).&lt;ref name="Heritage Toronto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albcan.org Albanian-Canadian community Association]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also other notable organizations, such as the Albanian Canadian Organization of Ottawa. www.albcanorg.ca

In 1619, a set organisation was finally established for the Austrian Imperial court which came to be the characteristic organisation of the Austrian-Habsburg court roughly kept from this point onward.&lt;ref name = akkerman/&gt; 
The first rank of the female courtiers was the ''[[Obersthofmeisterin]]'', who was second in rank after the empress herself, and responsible for all the female courtiers.&lt;ref name=akkerman&gt;Nadine Akkerman &amp; Birgit Houben, eds. ''The Politics of Female Households: Ladies-in-Waiting Across Early Modern Europe'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever absent, she was replaced by the ''Fräuleinhofmeisterin'', normally in charge of the unmarried female courtiers, their conduct and service.&lt;ref name=akkerman/&gt;

The early modern Danish court was organized according to the German court model, in turn inspired by the Imperial Austrian court model, from the 16th century onward.&lt;ref name=persson&gt;Fabian Persson (1999). ''Servants of Fortune. The Swedish Court between 1598 and 1721''. Lund: Wallin &amp; Dalholm. {{ISBN|91-628-3340-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest rank female courtier to a female royal was the ''[[hofmesterinde]]'' (Court Mistress) from 1694/98 onward named ''[[Overhofmesterinde]]'' (Chief Court Mistres), equivalent to the Mistress of the Robes, normally an elder widow, who supervised the rest of the ladies-in-waiting.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Kjølsen: Det Kongelige Danske Hof 1660–2000: en forvaltningshistorisk oversigt, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  

When the office was vacant the tasks where taken over by the second in command, the ''[[kammarfröken]]'', and this was also the case when the office of hofmesterinde to the queen was left vacant in 1808-23 and 1839-45, and was handled by Friederiche Amalie Marie Hedevig von der Manfe and Marie Ernestine Wilhelmine von Walterstorf respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Kongelig dansk hof- og statskalender&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The Austrian court model was the role model for the princely courts in Germany,&lt;ref name=akkerman/&gt; and the post of Obersthofmeisterin, or only ''hofmeisterin'', existed in the princely (and later royal) German courts as well. 

The German court model in turn became the role model of the early modern Scandinavian courts of Denmark and Sweden.&lt;ref name=persson&gt;Fabian Persson (1999). ''Servants of Fortune. The Swedish Court between 1598 and 1721''. Lund: Wallin &amp; Dalholm. {{ISBN|91-628-3340-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Netherlands==
In the 16th-century, the principal lady-in-waiting in the courts of the Habsburg governors of the Netherlands, Margaret of Austria and [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)]], was named ''hofmesterees'' ('Court mistress') or ''dame d'honneur''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Kerkhoff: Maria van Hongarije en haar hof 1505–1558: tot plichtsbetrachting uitverkoren&lt;/ref&gt; 

The principal female office holder in the royal court of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in the 19th-century was named ''Grootmeesteres'' ('Grand Mistress').&lt;ref&gt;Dianne Hamer: Sophie: biografie van Sophie van Würtemberg (1818–1877) op basis van brieven en dagboken, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Gravenhaagsche” Stads-Almanak: voor 1857&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norway==
During the union of Sweden-Norway in 1814–1905, Sweden and Norway shared the same royal family. At that time, there were two Chief Court Mistress for the same queen: one as Queen of Sweden at the Swedish royal court when she lived in Sweden, and a separate Chief Court Mistress as Queen of Norway at the Norwegian royal court, who served in her post during the visits of the Swedish-Norwegian royal family to Norway. 

Presently, the ''overhoffmesterinne'' in Norway acts as a vice hostess at the Norwegian royal court when the queen and the other female members of the royal family are absent.

In Sweden, the Chief Court Mistress is the second highest-ranking official of the royal household, preceded only by the [[Marshal of the Realm (Sweden)|Marshal of the Realm]]. She ranks immediately below the members of the [[Swedish Royal Family|royal family]], the [[speaker of the Parliament of Sweden|speaker of the Parliament]] and the [[Prime Minister of Sweden|prime minister]], and has precedence over former speakers of the Parliament and former prime ministers. The incumbent is [[Kirstine von Blixen-Finecke]], who has served from 2016.

The title and position have changed over time. Before the reign of [[Queen Christina of Sweden|Queen Christina]] (1632–1654), the title was generally referred to as ''hovmästarinna'' (Court Mistress), but during and after the reign of Christina, it became the custom to have two such Court mistresses subordinate to one ''överhovmästarinna'' (Chief Court Mistress).&lt;ref name="Persson1999"&gt;Fabian Persson (1999). Servants of Fortune. The Swedish court between 1598 and 1721. Lund: Wallin &amp; Dalholm. {{ISBN|91-628-3340-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the Queen and the Queen Dowager had a Chief Court Mistress called ''överhovmästarinna'' (the Chief Court Mistress) while the equivalent at the courts of other female members of the royal house was called ''hovmästarinna'' (Court Mistress). 

The position was the highest a female courtier could have in the Swedish royal court, and the ''överhovmästarinna'' was ranked an [[Excellency]], something unusual for a woman in the 17th century, which placed her immediately after the female members of the royal house in rank. Her role was to uphold etiquette at court, and receive and carry out the instructions of the Queen in the management of the court. She managed the employment of new members to the court of the Queen, and every meeting and letter to the Queen passed through her.&lt;ref name="Persson1999"/&gt; She also managed the ceremony of the court presentation, in which nobles were presented to the royal family and thus allowed to show themselves officially at court.&lt;ref&gt;Tydén-Jordan Astrid, red (1987).

'''Chileans in France''' consist mostly of refugees, but also other migrants such as students or economic workers, from [[Chile]] and their descendants in France.

== History ==
The overthrow of [[Salvador Allende]] on 11 September 1973, by a military junta, constitutes a major rupture in Chilean contemporary history. The violence of the Pronunciamento and the implementation of the tenets of the national security doctrine, supplemented by an ad hoc legislation, caused an enormous political, then economic migration, quite extraordinary for a [[Latin American]] country. In [[Europe]], [[France]] as well as [[Sweden]] were part of the main host countries. The exiles were given a particularly good reception in France because of the positive echo of the Popular Unity experience. Yet, banishment was an additional act of violence for these people who were seriously weakened by the events they had experienced. The effects of the temporality of exile and the individual reconstruction imposed by its extension will lead these [[Chileans]] to redefine the roles of each member of the family unit and accept a long denied reality, in order to try to achieve the integration process. Thus, even if the conditions of reception were favorable, the exiles had to rebuild their social connections, adapt to an unknown form of socialization and to often consent to be deskilled and resign themselves to remaining outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;http://alhim.revues.org/3833&lt;/ref&gt;

In the future, the system will no longer rely on the [[Government of Iran#Budget|government budget]], and shift focus toward a (privately) funded system. The pension system will have three major pillars such as:&lt;ref name=CSPO/&gt;

An '''''ex officio'' member''' is a member of a body (a board, committee, council, etc.) who is part of it by virtue of holding another office. The term ''[[List of Latin phrases (E)#ex officio|ex officio]]'' is [[Latin]], meaning literally "from the office", and the sense intended is "by right of office"; its use dates back to the [[Roman Republic]].

According to ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'', the term denotes only how one becomes a member of a body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite parl|title = RONR|edition = 11th|year = 2011|pages = 483–484}}(RONR)&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory rights of ''ex officio'' members may or may not be limited by the body's regulations or bylaws. In some groups ''ex officio'' members may frequently abstain from voting. Unless specifically stated in regulations or bylaws the rights, of an ex officio member, are constrained to purely advisory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#2 |title=Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 2) |date= |accessdate= |website=The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site |publisher=The Robert's Rules Association |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112102258/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html |archivedate=2004-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===prehistory===
[[File:Location greek ancient.png|300px|left|thumb|Greek population 6th century BC]]
The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] presence in Georgia, specifically in its western part (ancient [[Colchis]]), is attested to the 7th century BC, as part of the Old Greek Diaspora and has traditionally been concentrated in the [[Black Sea]] coast. According to one version, which nowadays doesn't enjoy much currency, the English name of the country (which is called ''Sakartvelo'' in [[Georgian language|Georgian]]) is Greek in origin and means ''agriculture''.&lt;ref name=Prevelakis&gt;George Prevelakis,[http://www.transcomm.ox.ac.uk/working%20papers/prevelakis.PDF  "Finis Greciae or the Return of the Greeks? State and Diaspora in the Context of Globalisation"], p.4, UFR de Géographie, Université de Paris-Sorbonne (Paris IV).&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks are known as ''[[Saberdzneti|Berdzeni]]'' (ბერძენი) in [[Georgian language|Georgian]], a unique [[exonym]], deriving from the Georgian word for "wise," a name commonly attributed to the notion that [[philosophy]] was born in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/translation/Georgian/%25E1%2583%25A1%25E1%2583%2590%25E1%2583%2591%25E1%2583%2594%25E1%2583%25A0%25E1%2583%25AB%25E1%2583%259C%25E1%2583%2594%25E1%2583%2597%25E1%2583%2598 | title= Websters thesaurus | accessdate= October 14, 2006 | work= Greece | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181114/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/translation/Georgian/%E1%83%A1%E1%83%90%E1%83%91%E1%83%94%E1%83%A0%E1%83%AB%E1%83%9C%E1%83%94%E1%83%97%E1%83%98 | archivedate= September 30, 2007 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Eastmond| first= A. | year= 2004 | title= Art and Identity in Thirteenth-Century Byzantium: Hagia Sophia and the Empire of Trebizond | publisher= Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | isbn= 0-7546-3575-9 | page= 137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Rapp, Jr. | first= S.

Greek artists, artisans, and Greek Orthodox clergymen were frequently seen in medieval Georgia. There was also a high degree of intermarriages between noble families, and several Georgian aristocratic houses, such as the [[Andronikashvili]], claimed [[Pontic Greek]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhailidis, Christos &amp; Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
Far more significant in increasing the Greek presence in Georgia was the settlement there of [[Pontic Greeks]] and [[Pontic Greeks|Eastern Anatolia Greeks]]. Large-scale Pontic Greek settlement in Georgia followed the Ottoman conquest of the [[Empire of Trebizond]] in 1461, when Greek refugees from the eastern [[Black Sea]] coastal districts, the [[Pontic Alps]], and then [[Eastern Anatolia]] fled or migrated to neighbouring Georgia and established the early nucleus of those later defined as [[Caucasus Greeks]]. These Pontic Greeks and their descendants who settled in [[Medieval Georgia]] often intermarried with their fellow-[[Eastern Orthodox]] Georgians and with those local [[Armenians]] and [[Ossetians]] who were mainly [[Oriental Orthodox]], as well as with later waves of Greek refugees and Russian settlers following the annexation of Georgia by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1801. However, it is difficult to verify the numbers of all such waves of Pontic Greeks from the Pontic Alps region to Georgia and the South Caucasus in general between circa 1520 and 1800, which according to [[Anthony Bryer]] is the most obscure period in the history of Pontus and the Pontic Greeks, owing to the scarcity of contemporary Greek and Ottoman Turkish sources on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Bryer, 'The Empire of Trebizond and the Pontus' (Variourum, 1980), XI., p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians suggest that following the Ottoman conquest of 1461, many, if not most Pontic Greeks retreated up into the highlands, where it was easier to maintain their culture and freedom from the encroachments of the Ottoman authorities. This movement was reinforced in the early 1600s by the growing power along the coastal valleys districts of the ''derebeys'' ('valley lords'), which further encouraged Pontic Greeks to retreat away from the coast deeper into the highlands and up onto the eastern Anatolian plateau, before some moved further east into the neighbouring Lesser Caucasus around Kars and southern Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;See also Anthony Bryer, 'The Empire of Trebizond and the Pontus' (Variourum, 1980), V., p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians also suggest that a major migratory movement of Pontic Greeks onto the eastern Anatolian plateau and the Lesser Caucasus occurred in the reign of [[Sultan Mehmed IV]] (1648–1687), during which a common pattern was initiated in Ottoman history: the Ottomans and their clients the [[Crimean Tatars]] suffered a string of severe defeats at the hands of the expansionist [[Russian Empire]] and followed this up with a wave of repression against the Greeks of both the southern Balkans and the Pontic Alps region, on the pretext that Greek statesmen and traders had colluded with the Tsar. As a result, many Pontic Greeks felt pressured into following their cousins who had left Pontus as refugees in previous generations, and so they too decided to migrate to southern Russia or neighbouring Georgia and the South Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;See also Anthony Bryer, 'The Empire of Trebizond and the Pontus' (Variourum, 1980), XI, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the pre-19th century presence of Pontic Greeks ih Georgia was complicated by the fact that following the Ottoman conquest of Georgia in 1578 during [[Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign]] many [[Greek Muslims]] (usually Pontic Greeks from northeastern Anatolia who had "turned Turk") settled in the country as representatives of Ottoman authority.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhailidis, Christos &amp; Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; These islamized and turkicized Pontic Greeks generally either assimilated into Georgia's Turkish-/Azeri-speaking population (such as those later defined as [[Meskhetian Turks]], many of whom were actually of islamized Georgian origin), emigrated as refugees back into Anatolia following the Russian annexation of Georgia in 1801, or reverted to their Greek Orthodoxy following the annexation and reintegrated into the country's other Christian communities, including those in the [[South Caucasus]] region later defined as [[Caucasus Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;Mikhailidis, Christos &amp; Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Group of workers harvesting tea Chakva Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg|thumb|340px|[[Greek people|Ethnic Greek]] women and children harvesting tea in [[Chakva]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], between 1905 and 1915. ''Photograph by [[Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii]]"]]

However, the largest number of Pontic Greeks who settled in Georgia according to widely attested documentary evidence did so in the early modern period and first half of the 19th century. In 1763, 800 Greek households from the [[Ottoman Empire]]’s [[Gümüşhane Province]] were transplanted by King [[Heraclius II of Georgia]] to develop silver and lead mining at [[Akhtala]] and [[Alaverdi, Armenia|Alaverdi]] (now in [[Armenia]]). Their descendants survive in Georgia’s [[Marneuli]] district. The next major movement into Georgia of [[Pontic Greeks]] fleeing Ottoman repression occurred following the [[Greek War of Independence]]. Many of these were the Christian, but largely [[Turcophone]] Greeks known as [[Urums]], who settled in the latter-day [[Tsalka]] district on the territory of the depopulated medieval Georgian province of [[Trialeti]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. But the largest wave that is widely attested and also traditionally cited by many Greeks in Georgia themselves was that of [[Pontic Greeks]] from the regions of [[Gumushane]] and [[Erzurum]] who had fled with their families to avoid likely Turkish reprisals following the withdrawal of the Russian army many of them had welcomed or collaborated with during its occupation of eastern Anatolia in the [[Russo-Turkish War]] of 1828–1829.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Anderson, 'The Eastern Question', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; These later waves of Pontic Greek refugees generally settled in villages in southern Georgia, where the main centres Armenian settlement were also concentrated, and assimilated into the preexisting Pontic Greek refugee communities that had already established themselves in the country between the late-15th and late-18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Topalidis, 'A Pontic Greek History' (2006), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

When these later migrants and refugees settled in Georgia they naturally assimilated through intermarriage with the smaller nucleus of Pontic Greeks settled there in the post-Byzantine and Ottoman period, as well as with the other Christian communities in the country, particularly with their fellow [[Greek Orthodox]] Georgians and Russians, and to a lesser extent also with those [[Ossetians]] and [[Armenians]] who were [[Oriental Orthodox]]. But because of the prestige and domineering nature of [[Byzantine]] and [[Christian Greek]] culture, these Pontic Greek communities tenaciously maintained their Greek culture and identity and their use of the Pontic Greek language, generally disregarding the language and culture of any other non-Hellenic but Christian ethnic groups of Georgia and the South Caucasus they had intermarried with, with the exception of Russian, which the Pontic Greeks of Georgia had had to learn for official and everyday purposes in the [[Russian Empire]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhailidis, Christos &amp; Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic Greek]] refugees also settled in the former Russian Caucasus province of [[Kars Oblast]] following the Russian empire's acquisition of a large area of northeastern Anatolia from the Ottoman Empire in 1878, and also along Georgia’s [[Black Sea]] coastline, where they formed a substantial and active community in the maritime towns. Many of these [[Caucasus Greeks]] who settled in the now Russian-controlled province of Kars Oblast had actually come from the communities settled in Georgia rather than directly from their ancestral homes in northeastern Anatolia. They were settled in [[Kars Oblast]] as a part of a planned Russian policy to Christianise a hitherto largely Muslim province, from which many Muslims had abandoned their lands following the Russian conquest and resettled in Ottoman territory.&lt;ref name=CAC&gt;[http://www.ca-c.org/journal/2005-06-eng/17.komprimen.shtml CA-C.org: The Greeks of Georgia: Migration and socioeconomic problesm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= EurasiaNet/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewGeorgia&gt;Gachechiladze, Revaz G. (1995), ''The New Georgia: Space, Society, Politics'', p. 93. Texas A&amp;M University Press, {{ISBN|0-89096-703-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1989, the largest Greek communities of Georgia were concentrated in Tsalka, [[Tbilisi]], and [[Abkhazia]], comprising 38.6%, 21.6% and 14.6% of all Georgian Greeks, respectively.&lt;ref name=NewGeorgia/&gt; Although Georgians and Greeks share many cultural traits, the Greek community of Georgia became more integrated with the Russians in the later centuries of the Russian empire and during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Many of them attended Russian schools, and spoke Russian as their secondary or even primary language, and frequently intermarried with partners of Russian origin. The post-Soviet civil strife and economic crisis forced many Greeks to emigrate abroad permanently, or on seasonal works.&lt;ref name=NewGeorgia/&gt; As a result, their number dropped to 15.166 (3,792 of them living in Tbilisi) as of the 2002 Georgia census (which does not include the data from a large part of breakaway Abkhazia).

=== Greeks in Abkhazia ===

Sukhumi once had the Greek names Sevastopolis and Dioskurias, however the Greek population of Abkhazia dates mostly from the [[Ottoman-Russian wars|Ottoman-Russian wars of the 19th century]]. They consisted mostly of [[Pontic Greeks]] from the southeast corner of the Black sea known as the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] near the ancient city of Trebizond. The Soviet authorities referred to them as ''greki'', although in their own Greek dialect they called themselves ''Romaioi'', meaning they were descendants of the ''Roman'' empire of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas de Waal, ''The Caucasus, an Introduction'' Oxford University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], ethnic Greeks of the [[Abkhaz ASSR]] were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported]] from 1949-1950 on the order of [[Joseph Stalin]] who referred to them as "stateless cosmopolitans". They were allowed to return in the late 1950s, however their number never reached pre-deportation level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethnic Cleansing in the USSR, 1937–1949|last= Otto Pohl|first= J.|year= 1999|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn= 0-313-30921-3|pages= 119–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Greeks fled Abkhazia (mostly to [[Greek Macedonia]] and [[Southern Russia]]) during and after the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–93)|1992–1993 war]] so that their number dropped from 14,664 in 1989 to just 1,486 in 2003.&lt;ref name = "2003 Census statistics (in Russian)"&gt;[http://www.ethno-kavkaz.narod.ru/rnabkhazia.html 2003 Census statistics] {{Ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece carried out a humanitarian operation, [[Operation Golden Fleece]], evacuating 1,015 Greeks who had decided to abandon their homes in Abkhazia on August 15, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Kathimerini, [http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_100003_09/08/2003_32859 The anniversary of Operation Golden Fleece to evacuate diaspora Greeks from war in Abkhazia], Dionyssis Kalamvrezos {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060603002653/http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_100003_09/08/2003_32859 |date=June 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greeks in Tsalka ===
Until thirty years ago Greeks made up 70% of the 30,000 strong population of  the Georgian city of [[Tsalka]] and villages in the surrounding plateau. Many of these were actually Turkish-speaking but [[Eastern Orthodox]] Greeks referred to as [[Urums]]. Today only about 2,000 of the Tsalka Greeks remain, mostly elderly, as most chose to migrate to Greece, and in particular to [[Greek Macedonia]] in [[Northern Greece]]. Many Greek Georgians returning to the country for [[Easter|Greek Easter]] find their homes looted or occupied by squatters, mostly immigrants from other regions of the country, who refuse to allow them entry. Consequently, the number of Greeks returning to Georgia has decreased. Some have claimed that the difficulties they face in reclaiming the homes are part of a deliberate attempt by the Georgian government to uproot the community in favour of ethnic [[Georgian people|Georgians]].&lt;ref name= EurasiaNet&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/eav072106.shtml EurasiaNet: Georgia's Greeks: Trying to come home]&lt;/ref&gt; Instances of violence, related to the above have sometimes resulted in the death of elderly Greeks while more have been injured.&lt;ref name= EurasiaNet/&gt; The Georgian government had to twice dispatch a Special Forces unit to prevent further outbreaks of inter-communal violence. In 2005 the Council of Greeks in Georgia has appealed to the World Council of Hellenes, SAE, registering their fear caused by the increasing instances of previously rare ethnic violence against them. The matter was also discussed in the parliament of Greece.&lt;ref name=HRI&gt;[http://www.hri.org/news/greek/mpab/2005/05-04-19.mpab.html HRI: The hardships of the Greeks in Tsalka]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Helen Louise Bullock.jpg|thumb|right|Helen Louise Bullock]]
'''Helen Louise Bullock''' (née '''Helen Louise Chapel'''; April 29, 1836 – ?) was a musical educator, temperance reformer, women's prison reformer, suffragist, and philanthropist from the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. For 35 years, she taught piano, organ and guitar. She gave up her profession of music, in which she had achieved some prominence, to become a practical volunteer in the work for [[suffrage]] and [[Temperance movement|temperance]]. In 1889, she was appointed national organizer of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU) and in that work went from [[Maine]] to [[California]], traveling {{convert|13000|miles}} in one year. During the first five years of her work, she held over 1,200 meetings, organizing 108 new unions and secured over 10,000 new members, active and honorary.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=671}} She received in one year the largest two prizes ever given by the national WCTU for organizing work.{{sfn|Clarke|1902|p=124-127}}

==Early years and education==
Bullock was born in [[Norwich, New York]], in 1836. She was the youngest daughter of Joseph (d. 1861) and Phebe Wood Chapel (d. 1871), of Connecticut and Rhode Island, respectively. Her maternal grandfather, Rev. John Chapel, was a soldier of the Revolutionary war. He was born in New England of English ancestry, and died in [[Chenango County, New York]], about 1830. Bullock's father was a cabinetmaker and wood carver by trade, and took an active part in local politics, serving as [[sheriff of Chenango County, New York]]. Her parents were regular attendants of the Presbyterian church. They were married in 1821 and became the parents of eight children, of whom five died in early childhood. Antoinette became the wife of Charles S. La Hotte, who served in the Eighth New York Cavalry during the Civil war, and they spent their lives in Norwich, New York. [[Francis Chapel]] (d. 1884, [[Sioux City, Iowa]]), the only son who reached maturity, was born in Chenango county, and in 1864 went west, being one of the seven men who founded Sioux City, and also one of the founders of [[Yankton, South Dakota]]. Helen completed the family.{{sfn|Clarke|1902|p=124-127}}

Bullock took an elective course in the Norwich Academy and was graduated from that institution in 1854. Some years later she studied the piano with [[Sebastian Bach Mills|S. B. Mills]], and the guitar with Count Lepcowshi, both of [[New York City]].{{sfn|Clarke|1902|p=124-127}}

==Music educator and composer==
At 18 years of age, she began to teach piano and vocal music. In November 1885, Bullock came to Elmira, and as a music teacher organized a large class, which she successfully conducted for some time. With the exception of two years, she taught music from 1854 to 1886, and was for many years a member of the [[National Music Teachers' Association]]. In 1881, she published two books of musical studies, "Scales and Chords" and "Improved Musical Catechism", both of which had a large sale. When William A. Pond, who purchased the copyrights, was arranging for their publication, he requested the author's name to be given as H. L. Bullock, in order that the foreign teachers might not know they were written by a woman, and therefore be prejudiced against or undervalue them. It was very hard for her to give up her music profession, but after great consideration she devoted her life to temperance reform.{{sfn|Clarke|1902|p=124-127}}{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=606}} For 35 years, she taught piano, organ and guitar.{{sfn|Eagle|1895|p=143}}

==Woman's Christian Temperance Union==
[[File:HelenLouiseBullock.png|thumb|Helen Louise Bullock]]
From 1871 to 1885 her home was in [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York|Fulton, New York]], but after a serious illness of [[pneumonia]] her physician recommended a milder climate, and the family moved to [[Elmira, New York]].{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=606}}

In April 1886 she was made president of the city WCTU, which was organized with 30 members, and held that position for two years and ten months. Attending the first state convention at [[Albany, New York]] in that year, she was chosen state organizer of the work, which position she filled for three years.{{sfn|Clarke|1902|p=124-127}} In September of that year [[Mary T. Burt]], president of the New York State WCTU, organized [[Chemung County, New York|Chemung County]] and urged Bullock to go into the adjoining counties of Broome, Schuyler, Tioga and Yates and organize them, which she did.

In 1889, she was appointed national organizer of the WCTU, and in that work went from [[Maine]] to [[California]], traveling {{convert|13000|miles}}  in one year. In that department, she achieved marked success; during the first five years, she held over 1,200 meetings, organizing 180 new unions, and securing over 10,000 members, active and honorary. {{sfn|Willard|1893|p=606}} Also in 1889, she resigned the presidency of the local union and took up national work, being made national organizer at [[Chicago]] the same year. She  served as such, and was a delegate to every national convention, attending all except the one held at [[Seattle]] in 1900. Her work took her all over the US, becoming one of the most instructive lecturers in the temperance field. At the world's convention, held at [[Toronto]] in 1897, she was appointed "around the world missionary," but met with an accident in a street car which prevented her from going, and was in a sanitarium for some months. She met with another serious accident while in Chicago in 1899. During the World's Fair in that city, in 1893, she delivered an interesting lecture before the Woman's Congress.{{sfn|Clarke|1902|p=124-127}}

Bullock was assisted by her daughter, Florence, and since 1899 they had charge of the national headquarters of the WCTU, at [[Chautauqua, New York]], conducting conferences in the different departments. Both were prominent speakers. The daughter was connected with the Loyal Legion, was acting secretary, and was appointed national associate in the purity work, having charge of the home office. In the national union, Bullock was a member of the executive committee, and was chairman of the standing committee on Sabbath meetings since 1896, seeing that all pulpits were filled where speakers had been invited to fill them during the national conventions. In 1902, she again received this appointment, but was obliged to decline, as the purity conference demanded her time during the conventions. During the 16 years of her organizing work, she  secured over 25,000 members for the organization, all of whom have received the white ribbon badge from Bullock.{{sfn|Clarke|1902|p=124-127}}

==Activist==
In 1887, she was named WCTU New York State superintendent of the department of narcotics, and in 1888, national lecturer on that subject. She was instrumental in securing the New York State law against selling cigarettes and tobacco to minors. In the interest of that department, she wrote the leaflet "The Tobacco Toboggan." She was deeply interested in prison and police matron work, and was president, since its organization, of the Anchorage of Elmira, a rescue home for young girls; its name was subsequently changed to the Helen L. Bullock Industrial Training School for Girls. In 1892, she was appointed superintendent of the school of methods of the New York State WCTU. She held the office of national superintendent of purity and mothers meetings, and state superintendent of purity. For a time she was superintendent of narcotics in New York and secured the passage of the anti-cigarette bill. The curfew law came under her national department of purity, and she became instrumental in having it secured in hundreds of towns and cities throughout the country. In local work, Bullock was president of the Anchorage, in which many a fallen girl has become a self-respecting woman and a useful member of society. She received in one year the largest two prizes ever given by the national WCTU for organizing work.{{sfn|Board of Charities|1917|p=234, 1045, 1069}}{{sfn|Clarke|1902|p=124-127}}{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=606}}

She was active in Elmira's politics, as well as the suffrage movement.{{sfn|Byrne|2000|p=5208}}

==Personal life==
At Norwich, she was married in 1856 to Daniel S. Bullock, son of Rev. Seymour Bullock, of [[Prospect, New York]], a Methodist Episcopal minister. He was born in [[Oneida County, New York]], in 1833, and was for a number of years a merchant at [[Bainbridge, New York]]. Daniel subsequently spent two years in the west and then located in [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York]], where he engaged in the carriage business. There Bullock taught music, remaining at that place 14 years. By this marriage, she had three children: Frank C., who was educated at Falley Seminary, became the editor of the Fulton Times, and died in Fulton in 1884, at the age of 27 years, leaving a wife but no children; Phoebe L. died in infancy; and Florence L., born April 22, 1879, who made her home with her mother in Elmira. She was a graduate of the high school of this city, and also took a c≤ourse in kindergarten work at Providence, Rhode Island.Soon after the death of her son, in 1884, Bullock adopted a little motherless girl, five years of age.

Bullock's religious training was in the Presbyterian Church and Sunday-school, but, when converted, her ideas on baptism led her to unite with the Baptist Church. She was active in the Sunday school and missionary work.{{sfn|Clarke|1902|p=124-127}}{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=606}}

The '''Hypomania Checklist''' ('''HCL-32''') is a [[questionnaire]] developed by Dr. [[Jules Angst]] to identify [[hypomania|hypomanic]] features in patients with [[major depressive disorder]] in order to help recognize [[bipolar disorder|bipolar II disorder]] and other bipolar spectrum disorders&lt;ref name="Bowling A 281–91"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bowling A |title=Mode of questionnaire administration can have serious effects on data quality |journal=Journal of Public Health |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=281–91 |year=2005 |pmid=15870099 |doi=10.1093/pubmed/fdi031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when people seek help in primary care and other general medical settings. It asks about 32 behaviors and mental states that are either aspects of hypomania or features associated with mood disorders. It uses short phrases and simple language, making it easy to read. The [[University of Zurich]] holds the copyright, and the HCL-32 is available for use at no charge. More recent work has focused on validating translations and testing whether shorter versions still perform well enough to be helpful clinically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forty L, Kelly M, Jones L, Jones I, Barnes E, Caesar S, Fraser C, Gordon-Smith K, Griffiths E, Craddock N, Smith DJ |title=Reducing the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32) to a 16-item version |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=124 |issue=3 |pages=351–6 |year=2010 |pmid=20129673 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2010.01.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent meta-analyses find that it is one of the most accurate assessments available for detecting hypomania, doing better than other options at recognizing bipolar II disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carvalho|first=André F.|last2=Takwoingi|first2=Yemisi|last3=Sales|first3=Paulo Marcelo G.|last4=Soczynska|first4=Joanna K.|last5=Köhler|first5=Cristiano A.|last6=Freitas|first6=Thiago H.|last7=Quevedo|first7=João|last8=Hyphantis|first8=Thomas N.|last9=McIntyre|first9=Roger S.|date=2015-02-01|title=Screening for bipolar spectrum disorders: A comprehensive meta-analysis of accuracy studies|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165032714006466|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|language=English|volume=172|pages=337–346|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2014.10.024|issn=0165-0327|pmid=25451435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takwoingi|first=Yemisi|last2=Riley|first2=Richard D.|last3=Deeks|first3=Jonathan J.|date=2015-11-01|title=Meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies in mental health|url=http://ebmh.bmj.com/content/18/4/103|journal=Evidence Based Mental Health|language=en|volume=18|issue=4|pages=103–109|doi=10.1136/eb-2015-102228|issn=1468-960X|pmc=4680179|pmid=26446042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and history==
The Hypomania Checklist was built as a more efficient screening measure for hypomania, to be used both in epidemiological research and in clinical use. Existing measures for bipolar disorder focused on identifying personality factors and symptom severity instead of the episodic nature of hypomania or the possible negative consequences in behavioral, affective, or cognitive changes associated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These measures were mostly used in non-clinical populations to identify individuals at risk and were not used as screening instruments. The HCL-32 is a measure intended to have high sensitivity to direct clinicians from many countries to diagnosing individuals in a clinical population with bipolar disorder, specifically bipolar II disorder.

Initially developed by Jules Angst and Thomas Meyer in German, the questionnaire was translated into English and translated back to German to ensure accuracy. The English version of the HCL has been used as the basis for translation in other languages through the same process. The original study that used the HCL in an Italian and a Swiss sample noted the measure's high sensitivity and a lower sensitivity than other used measures.

The scale includes a checklist of 32 possible symptoms of hypomania, each rated yes or no.  The rating "yes" would mean the symptom is present or this trait is "typical of me," and "no" would mean that the symptom is not present or "not typical" for the person.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Angst J, Adolfsson R, Benazzi F, Gamma A, Hantouche E, Meyer TD, Skeppar P, Vieta E, Scott J |title=The HCL-32: towards a self-assessment tool for hypomanic symptoms in outpatients |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=217–33 |year=2005 |pmid=16125784 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2005.05.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations==
The HCL suffers from the same problems as other [[self-report inventories]], in that scores can be easily exaggerated or minimized by the person completing them. Like all questionnaires, the way the instrument is administered can influence the final score. If a patient is asked to fill out the form in front of other people in a clinical environment, for instance, social expectations may elicit a different response compared to administration via a postal survey.&lt;ref name="Bowling A 281–91"/&gt;

Similar [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]] scores were found when only using 16 item assessments versus the traditional 32-item format of the HCL-32{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. A score of at least 8 items was found valid and reliable for distinguishing Bipolar Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. In a study, 73% of patients who completed the HCL-32 R1 were true bipolar cases identified as potential bipolar cases. However, the HCL-32 R1 does not accurately differentiate between Bipolar I and Bipolar II.&lt;ref name=AngstWeb&gt;{{cite web|last1=Angst|date=June 2007|title=Hypomania Check List (HCL-32 R1) Manual|url=http://www.lakarhuset.com/docs/HCL_32_R1_Manual.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the 16-item HCL has not been tested as a standalone section in a hospital setting. In addition, while the HCL-32 is a sensitive instrument for hypomanic symptoms, it does not distinguish between [[bipolar I]] and bipolar-II disorders{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. The HCL-32 has not been compared with other commonly used screening tools for bipolar disorder, such as the [[Young Mania Rating Scale]] and the [[Parent General Behavior Inventory|General Behavior Inventory]]. The online version of the HCL has been shown to be as reliable as the paper version.&lt;ref name=AngstWeb /&gt;

'''Igbo Canadians''' are citizens of [[Canada]] that are of whole or part [[Igbo people|Igbo]] descent. The Igbo are an ethnic group from [[Nigeria]]. The 2001 Canadian census put the number of people who identified as Igbo at 1,200. Because of nationality, many Igbo people would have identified as Nigerian. The number of self-identified Nigerians according to the same census was 9,530.&lt;ref name="statcan2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&amp;PID=62911&amp;APATH=3&amp;GID=431515&amp;METH=1&amp;PTYPE=55440&amp;THEME=44&amp;FOCUS=0&amp;AID=0&amp;PLACENAME=0&amp;PROVINCE=0&amp;SEARCH=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GK=0&amp;VID=0&amp;FL=0&amp;RL=0&amp;FREE=0 |title=Ethnic Origin (232), Sex (3) and Single and Multiple Responses (3) for Population, for Canada, Provinces, Territories, Census Metropolitan Areas 1 and Census Agglomerations, 2001 Census - 20% Sample Data |publisher=statcan.ca |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Indians in Chile''' form one of the smaller populations of the Indian diaspora. The large majority of them of Sindhi descent. A few Indians went to Chile in the 1920s. Later more Indians migrated there about 30 years ago - not only from [[India]], but also from [[Hong Kong]], [[Spain]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Indonesia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Panama]], [[the Philippines]] and [[Singapore]].

==History==
Some migrants from [[British India]] (including [[Pakistan]]) arrived to work in mining, railroads, and agriculture in the early 20th century, usually under [[United Kingdom|British]]-owned corporations. However most Indians in Chile are new arrivals in the 1980s and the 1990s for economic reasons. Today, about 1,500 Indians live in Chile, mostly in [[Santiago]].

The first immigrants from India (mostly of Sindhi descent) arrived to Magallanes (present-day [[Punta Arenas]]) in 1904 and worked as traders. Their descendants moved to different parts of the country, though mostly to [[Santiago]]. Descendants of Sindhi migrants to Chile also live on the northern coast (i.e. [[Arica]], [[Iquique]] and [[Antofagasta]]). A second large wave of Indian immigration occurred in the 1980s. These are the people who set up the '''Indian Association of Santiago'''.

There are 90 families which amount to 400 people in Santiago alone. Nationally, there are about 1500 people of Indian origin (mainly Sindhi) living in the country. There are also many Chileans who are interested in Indian culture.

==Business and employment==
There are various commercial opportunities in Chile for Indian immigrants and multinational firms have begun to arrive and along with them Indian engineers.

The '''Innocents''' were an alleged gang of outlaw [[Highwayman|road agents]] in [[Montana Territory]] who  operated during the [[gold rush]] of the 1860s, preying on shipments and travelers carrying gold from [[Virginia City, Montana]]. According to the early chronicler Thomas Dimsdale, the gang attempted to steal gold while it was being transported; they killed many travelers who resisted. Sheriff [[Henry Plummer]] of [[Bannack, Montana]] was accused of leading the group, and was executed by a group of [[vigilante]]s from Virginia City in January 1864, along with several other alleged gang members.

==Criminal activities==
Early historians, originating with Dimsdale, stated that the gang consisted of over one hundred members at its height. Their headquarters was supposedly based at the Rattlesnake Ranch, twelve miles outside of [[Virginia City, Montana]]. The gang allegedly killed over one hundred people (only eight deaths have been confirmed by documented sources) and stole a significant amount of gold while it was being transported the seventy-mile distance between [[Virginia City, Montana|Virginia City]] and Bannack.&lt;ref name=Millerp142&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|Miller|2008|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers believed the gang operated in small units in order to prey upon travelers from different towns. The gang was said to place watchmen in mine offices and gambling offices to determine when gold would be shipped. The members of the gang were believed to use secret code words for identification, as well as a secret knot in their ties. Many residents soon became frustrated by the rate of robberies and murders. In late 1863 they formed a committee of vigilantes (the [[Montana Vigilantes]]) to combat the rash of murders and robberies.&lt;ref name=Clarkp47&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|1999|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vigilante justice==
Plummer was initially suspected of criminal activity after two residents who had been robbed claimed that they had recognized him during the robberies. Another local robbing victim said that, after he confronted Sheriff Plummer about the danger of the roads, Plummer offered to return some of his money to him.&lt;ref name=Millerp142/&gt; The vigilante committee arrested three men in [[Nevada City, Montana|Nevada City]] in December 1863, charging them with murder. One man was executed, and the group banished the other two.

After learning of this event, boot-maker [[Clubfoot George|George Lane]] rode to Bannack to tell Plummer about the incident. For the next month, the vigilante committee arrested many local men suspected of being part of Plummer's gang. They passed sentences ranging from execution to flogging to banishment. Shortly before one man was hanged, he told the assembled crowd that Plummer was the ringleader behind the recent crime spree.

This confirmed the suspicions held by the vigilantes, and they soon arrested Plummer. After being arrested, he tried to bribe his captors but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Millerp146/&gt; Between December 1863 and February 1864 the vigilante committee executed Plummer and twenty-two alleged members of his gang, including [[Clubfoot George|George Lane]]. At one point the vigilantes assembled a force of over 500 men and sealed off Virginia City in order to catch gang members.&lt;ref name=Clarkp47/&gt; The gallows on which Plummer was hanged had been built at his request as sheriff in relation to an earlier case.&lt;ref name=Millerp146&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|Miller|2008|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 5,000 people assembled to watch the hangings of the gang members.&lt;ref name=Clarkp47/&gt;

==Modern scholarship==

Scholars have noted a lack of documentation and other historical evidence pertaining to the Innocents. The earliest accounts of the gang have been shown to be unreliable. The descriptions of activities and secret codes conform to a common pattern of frontier mythography. (The number of members was "over a hundred," the number of victims also "over a hundred," their secret password was "I am innocent"). Frederick Allen and other modern scholars have questioned whether the gang was as influential as told. Mather and Boswell are among scholars who deny that any gang conducted the relatively few documented robberies in the area, saying they were more likely the work of a small number of independent (or at most loosely organized) outlaws.

, is a [[trade show]] that features industrial [[machinery]] and technology. It is the largest manufacturing technology trade show in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www10.mcadcafe.com/nbc/articles/1/867946/IMTS-%E2%80%93-International-Manufacturing-Technology-Show-2010-Sets-Stage-Strong-Comeback-Manufacturing?interstitial_displayed=Yes|title=IMTS – The International Manufacturing Technology Show 2010 Sets the Stage for a Strong Comeback in Manufacturing|author=|date=2010-09-24|work= |publisher=Internet Business Systems, Inc|accessdate= 2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1990 was renamed from the original "International Machine Tool Show" to reflect the growing scope of the show to additional technologies such as [[welding]], [[lubrication]], and [[materials engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imts.com/show/history1978.html|title=IMTS History|publisher=The Association for Manufacturing Technology|accessdate= 2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six-day show is held in even-numbered years at [[Chicago]]'s [[McCormick Place]] and draws attendees and exhibitors from the U.S. and some 119 other countries. The 2012 show registered 102,000 attendees and 1,909 exhibitors across four buildings and {{convert|1,240,863|sqft|m2}} of exhibit space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.thomasnet.com/companystory/IMTS-2010-sets-stage-for-strong-manufacturing-comeback-584552|title=IMTS 2010 sets stage for strong manufacturing comeback|author= |date=2010-09-23|work= |publisher=Thomas Publishing Company, LLC|accessdate= 2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being an exhibition for suppliers of machinery and other manufacturing technology, since 2004 IMTS has sponsored the Emerging Technology Center, where new developments from both academia and industry are showcased.  IMTS 2012, for example, featured a [[Local Motors Rally Fighter]] car built live right on the show floor, [[MTConnect]], the open-source communication and interconnectivity standard, and MT''Insight'', the game-changing customized manufacturing business intelligence system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfrtech.com/articles/2997.html|title=SME and IMTS Unveil Plans for IMTS 2010 Emerging Technology Center|publisher=Manufacturers Group Inc|accessdate=2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is managed by the [[Association for Manufacturing Technology]].

An agreement between the AMT and the CECIMO (European Machine Tool Industry Association), which organizes the European-based [[EMO (trade show)|EMO]] trade show for the metal working industry, coordinates the IMTS and the EMO such that every even-numbered year the IMTS is held in Chicago, and every odd-numbered year the EMO is held in Europe.

Statistics for '''Kidnapping in the United Kingdom''' are often hard to discover, due to the country's policies around the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.child-safety-for-parents.com/missing-children-statistics.html |title=Missing Children Statistics At A Glance: Listed By Country |publisher=Child-safety-for-parents.com |date=2013-05-14 |accessdate=2014-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708140127/http://www.child-safety-for-parents.com/missing-children-statistics.html |archivedate=2013-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==

Notably, U.K. has special categorization for the crime of child abduction, it is categorized under the violence against the person, in place of kidnapping. According to the ''Offender Management Caseload Statistics'', UK had recorded about 57 convicted kidnappings cases between 2007-2008. On 2008-2009, it was 21. The ''Caseload Statistics'' further notes that out of 98,820 prisoners in England and Wales, 217 were convicted of kidnapping. Of these 217 kidnappers, 208 were men, and 9 were women. Other analysis speaks about the criminal histories, using the official records as the source. About 7042 males and 545 females who had been jailed for their convicted kidnapping between 1979 and 2001. Only 10 men and 14 women had been sentenced for more than 1 convicted kidnapping. The average age of kidnappers is around mid 20s, and more than 1/2 of the men, and 1/3 of the women kidnappers had been convicted of other offenses, usually thieving and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology and Crime: An Introduction to Criminological Psychology|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|first=Clive R.|last=Hollin|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
A 2004 Home Office research study presented 798 police reports regarding child abduction in England and [[Wales]]. Of those reports, that 56% (447) involved a stranger, about 375 were attempted abductions while 72 were successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/02/child-abduction-cases-stranger-research|title=More than half of all reported child abduction cases involve a stranger|first=Amelia|last=Hill|publisher=Guardian|date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kidnapping figures published by the [[Office for National Statistics]] recorded about 532 cases of child abductions that were reported to police in 2011/12. Figures do not include Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers |first=Simon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/oct/04/child-abduction-statistics-england-wales |title=Child abduction in England &amp; Wales: the key numbers &amp;#124; UK news |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2012-10-04 |accessdate=2014-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated of 500 cases of parental kidnapping are reported in the country, every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=When Parents Kidnap|page=4|author1=Geoffrey L. Greif|author2=Rebecca L. Hegar|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Original caption in his 1912 book: ''Klemantans making fire in the jungle by sawing one piece of bamboo across another.'']]
The '''Klemantan people''' were a purported ethnic group indigenous to the island of [[Borneo]]. The term was established in Western literature by [[United Kingdom|British]] scientist and colonial administrator [[Charles Hose]] in the early 20th century, but has since been rejected as an invented term of convenience that does not properly represent the people it claims to describe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rousseau|first1=Jérôme|title=Central Borneo: Ethnic Identity and Social Life in a stratified Society|date=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, New York|isbn=0198277164|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term has fallen largely out of use.

==Origin==
Hose had decades-long experience as a colonial administrator of [[Sarawak]], at that time an independent kingdom ruled by the British [[White Rajahs|Brooke dynasty]] on the northwestern coast of Borneo. When describing the native people of Sarawak, Hose categorized them into six different "principal groups": [[Iban people|Ibans]], [[Kayan people (Borneo)|Kayans]], [[Kenyah people|Kenyahs]], [[Lun Bawang|Muruts]], Punans, and the "Klemantans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hose|first1=Charles|last2=McDouggall|first2=William|title=The Pagan Tribes of Borneo: A Description of Their Physical Moral and Intellectual Condition with Some Discussion of Their Ethnic Relations, Volume I|date=1912|publisher=MacMillan and Co.|location=London|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the other five groupings are considered to be valid ethnic groups, "Klemantan" was basically a catch-all category that contained every native group that could not otherwise be fitted into the existing 5 categories. Thus, by his definition, a ''Klemantan'' was every native Bornean who was not an Iban, a Kayan, a Kenyah, a Murut or a Punan. This in Hose's eyes did not only include numerous smaller groups and communities within Sarawak, but also the native groups living in the [[Kalimantan|Dutch part of Borneo]] at that time, about whom Charles Hose had no first-hand knowledge.

Later scholars disclaimed the existence of the Klemantan people as a valid ethnic category, as the term merely represents a European view-point rather than the people's own and ultimately was made up for pure convenience. French cultural anthropologist Jérôme Rousseau, for example, forwarded the question why Hose "felt compelled to invent a concept which corresponds to no social, cultural, geographical, or historical reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rousseau|first1=Jérôme|title=Central Borneo: Ethnic Identity and Social Life in a stratified Society|date=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, New York|isbn=0198277164|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Klemantan and Kalimantan==
The modern-day Indonesian name for Borneo island, [[Kalimantan]], is derived from the same root as ''Klemantan''.

'''Kusunda''' (Kusanda) is a [[language isolate]] spoken by a handful of people in western and central [[Nepal]]. It has only recently been described in any detail.

==Rediscovery==
For decades the Kusunda language was thought to be on the verge of extinction, with little hope of ever knowing it well. The little material that could be gleaned from the memories of former speakers suggested that the language was an isolate, but without much evidence either way it was often classified along with its neighbors as [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]. However, in 2004 three [[Kusunda people|Kusunda]]s, Gyani Maya Sen, Prem Bahadur Shahi and Kamala Singh,&lt;ref name=3Kusundas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://listserv.emich.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0410&amp;L=endangered-languages-l&amp;P=439 |title=Kusunda language does not fall in any family: Study |accessdate=2007-09-12 |last=Rana |first=B.K. |date=2004-10-12 |work=email with pasted news article |publisher=Himalayan News Service, Lalitpur, 2004-10-10 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; were brought to [[Kathmandu]] for help with citizenship papers. There, members of [[Tribhuvan University]] discovered that one of them, a native of Sakhi VDC in southern [[Rolpa District]], was a fluent speaker of the language. Several of her relatives were also discovered to be fluent. There are now known to be at least seven or eight fluent speakers of the language, the youngest in her thirties.&lt;ref name="Watters2006"/&gt; However, the language is [[moribund language|moribund]], with no children learning it, as all Kusunda speakers have married outside their ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Watters2006"&gt;Watters, David E. 2005. ''Kusunda: a typological isolate in South Asia.'' In Yogendra Yadava, Govinda Bhattarai, Ram Raj Lohani, Balaram Prasain and Krishna Parajuli (eds.), Contemporary issues in Nepalese linguistics p.&amp;nbsp;375-396. Kathmandu: Linguistic Society of Nepal.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was presumed that with the death of Rajamama Kusunda on 19 April 2018 the language went extinct though Gyani Maiya Sen could be the only surviving speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-04-19/rajamama-lone-kusunda-language-speaker-dies.html|title=Rajamama, lone Kusunda language speaker, dies|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
[[David E. Watters|Watters]] (2005) published a mid-sized grammatical description of the language, plus vocabulary, which shows that Kusunda is indeed a language isolate, not just genealogically but also lexically, grammatically, and phonologically distinct from its neighbors. It appears that Kusunda is a remnant of the languages spoken in northern India before the influx of Tibeto-Burman- and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]-speaking peoples, however it is not classified as a [[Munda language|Munda]] or a [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] language. It thus joins [[Burushaski]], [[Nihali]] and (potentially) the substrate of the [[Vedda language]] in the list of South Asian languages which do not fall into the main categories of Indo-European, Dravidian, [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Austroasiatic]].

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Phonetically, Kusunda has six vowels in two [[vowel harmony|harmonic]] groups, which are arguably three vowels phonemically: a word will normally have vowels from the upper (pink) or lower (green) set, but not both simultaneously.  There are very few words that consistently have upper or lower vowels; most words may be pronounced either way, though those with [[uvular consonant]]s require the lower set (as in many languages). There are a few words with no uvular consonants that still bar such dual pronunciations, though these generally only feature the distinction in careful enunciation.&lt;ref name=Watters/&gt;

|-
|align="center" | [[Open vowel|Open]] || || align="center" bgcolor="#ccffcc"| {{IPA|a}} || 
|}

===Consonants===
Kusunda consonants seem to only contrast the active articulator, not where that articulator makes contact. For example, apical consonants may be [[dental consonant|dental]], [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]], [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]], or [[palatal consonant|palatal]]: {{IPA|/t/}} is dental {{IPA|[t̪]}} before {{IPA|/i/}}, alveolar {{IPA|[t͇]}} before {{IPA|/e, ə, u/}}, retroflex {{IPA|[ʈ]}} before {{IPA|/o, a/}}, and palatal {{IPA|[c]}} when there is a following uvular, as in {{IPA|[coq]}} ~ {{IPA|[t͇ok]}} ('we').&lt;ref name=Watters/&gt;

In addition, many consonants vary between [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[fricative consonant|fricative]]s; for instance, {{IPA|/p/}} seems to surface as {{IPA|[b]}} between vowels, while {{IPA|/b/}} surfaces as {{IPA|[β]}} in the same environment. [[Aspiration (phonetics)|Aspiration]] appears to be recent to the language. Kusunda also lacks the [[retroflex consonant]] phonemes common to the region, and is unique in the region in having [[uvular consonant]]s.&lt;ref name=Watters/&gt;

{{IPA|[ʕ]}} does not occur initially, and {{IPA|[ŋ]}} only occurs at the end of a syllable, unlike in neighboring languages. {{IPA|[ɴʕ]}} only occurs between vowels; it may be |{{IPA|ŋ+ʕ}}|.&lt;ref name=Watters/&gt;

==Pronouns==

Kusunda has several cases, marked on nouns and pronouns three of which are [[nominative]] (Kusunda, unlike its neighbors, has no [[ergativity]]), [[genitive]], and [[accusative case|accusative]] [[Grammatical person|persons]].&lt;ref name=Watters&gt;Watters (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other case suffixes include '''-ma''' "together with", '''-lage''' "for", '''-əna''' "from", '''-ga, -gə''' "at, in".

There are also [[demonstrative pronoun]]s '''na''' and '''ta'''. Although it is not clear what the difference between them is, it may be [[animacy]].

Subjects may be marked on the verb, though when they are, they may either be prefixed or suffixed. An example with ''am'' "eat", which is more regular than many verbs, in the present tense (''-ən'') is,

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! am "eat"
! Singular
! Plural
|-
|First person|| align="center"| t-əm-ən || align="center"| t-əm-da-n
|-
|Second person|| align="center"| n-əm-ən || align="center"| n-əm-da-n
|-
|Third person|| align="center"| g-əm-ən || align="center"| g-əm-da-n
|}

Other verbs may have a prefix '''ts-''' in the first person, or zero in the third.

==Long-range comparisons==
Before the recent discovery of active Kusunda speakers, there were several attempts to link the language to an established language family. B. K. Rana (2002) maintains that Kusunda is a [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman language]] as traditionally classified. Others have linked it to [[Munda languages|Munda]] (see [[David E. Watters|Watters]] 2005); [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]] (Gurov 1989); [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]] and [[Caucasian languages|Caucasian]] (Reinhard and Toba 1970; this would be a variant of Gurov's proposal if [[Sino-Caucasian]] is accepted); the [[Nihali language|Nihali]] isolate in central India (Fleming 1996, Whitehouse 1997); and again with Nihali, as part of the [[Indo-Pacific languages|Indo-Pacific]] hypothesis (Whitehouse et al. 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

None of these proposals took Watters' more recent data into consideration, and none is widely accepted. Kusunda pronouns do resemble those of the languages of the [[Andamanese languages|Andaman Islands]] and [[West Papuan languages|West New Guinea]]: Compared to [[Oko-Juwoi language|Juwoi]], we have ''tsi'' (likely from *ti) vs. ''tui'' "I", ''tsi-yi'' (*ti-ye) vs. ''tii-ye'' "my", ''nu'' vs. ''ŋui'' "thou" (Kusunda has no initial ŋ), ''ni-yi'' (*ni-ye) vs. ''ŋii-ye'' "thy", ''gi-na'' "that" vs. ''kitɛ'' "this". (See a summary [[Merritt Ruhlen#Kusunda as an Indo-Pacific language|here]].)

The '''''Landstände''''' (singular ''Landstand'') or '''''Landtage''''' (singular ''Landtag'') were the various [[estates of the realm|territorial estates or diets]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[early modern period]], as opposed to their respective [[territorial lord]]s (the ''Landesherrn'').

== Usage ==
The structure of the ''Landstände'' was highly variable depending on the country and period of history. Furthermore, both the representatives of the older system, the ''Ständeordnung'', where the estates were predominant, and the parliaments of the newer people's representative systems were called ''Landstände''. The term ''Landtag'' was used, both under the ''Ständeordnung'' as well as the newer representative structures, for a general assembly of the estates or the parliament. The totality of the ''Landstände'' in a sovereign territory was also called the ''Landschaft''.

In the older feudal system the estates originally consisted of the assembly of deputies of the privileged estates of a country, the [[nobility]] and the [[clergy]], who had joined together to form an organised body. Later, representatives of the towns were added. In some cases (for example, in [[Vienna]], [[Württemberg]] or [[Mecklenburg]]) [[yeomen]] (''Freibauer'') were also given the right to participate as representatives of the [[peasant]]s.&lt;ref name="Herders"&gt;Herders Conversations-Lexikon. Freiburg im Breisgau 1855, Vol. 3, p. 704.&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual exception were the estates in the land of [[Land Hadler|Hadler]], which were formed almost exclusively of the farmers of large farms (''Großbauer'').&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Rüther: „Hadler Chronik. Quellenbuch zur Geschichte des Landes Hadeln.“ 1932. Neu heraus gegeben Bremerhaven 1979. pp. 37 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

At the ''Landtage'' the ''Landstände'' were divided into separate ''curiae'' (divisions). As a rule, three ''curiae'' were usually distinguished: the [[prelate]]s, the [[knight]]s and the [[town]]s.&lt;ref name="Götzinger"&gt;Götzinger, E.: Reallexicon der Deutschen Altertümer. Leipzig, 1885., pp. 943-944.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the early ''Landstände'' initially only represented the rights of their own estate and could only indirectly be considered to represent the whole population in their domain at the same time. In the ''Ständeordnungen'', unlike [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] systems of rule, the prince could not raise new taxes or adopt new laws outside his own personal estate (''chamber goods'' or ''Kämmergüter'') without the consent of the ''Landstände''.&lt;ref name="Herders" /&gt; In some cases, the estates also shared in the administration of justice and other public affairs. The limits of their powers were not usually accurately determined.

Sometimes the term ''Landstände'' was retained even for the constitutional assemblies of newer representative systems, which in many countries took the place of the privileged assemblies of the ''Ständeordnung'' during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Michael EHRLE: Volksvertretung im Vormärz. Studien zur Zusammensetzung, Wahl und Funktion der deutschen Landtage im Spannungsfeld zwischen monarchischem Prinzip und ständischer Repräsentation, 2 Bde., Frankfurt a. M., 1979 [=Europ. Hochschulschriften III/127].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Precursor ===
The ''Landstände'' first emerged in the 14th century, although the term itself was not used in [[Middle High German]] and was probably first translated later from the [[French language|French]] word ''états''.&lt;ref name="Götzinger" /&gt;  But it was not a new concept. The records of the Roman historian, [[Tacitus]], show that co-determination was already being practised in the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]] at important public occasions. And according to the old Germanic law, public meetings and court hearings - the so-called ''[[thing (assembly)|things]]'' - were held, in the open. Even in the later [[Francia|Frankish Empire]], alongside the general assemblies of the [[nobility]] and [[clergy]], so-called ''[[placita]]'' are recorded; a form of representation of the people.

In individual tribes, for example the [[Bavaria]]ns and [[Saxons]], there were such meetings too. However, these gatherings did not represent a formal grouping of the estates, as had evolved by the 14th century. Even the [[Hoftag|imperial and knightly assemblies]] and the state ''things'' of the 12th and 13th centuries were structures that dealt with the general welfare of the land, but these meetings still lacked the character of an independent body.

=== Entstehung der Landstände ===
Seit dem 14. Jahrhundert bildeten sich mit der Entwicklung der [[Landeshoheit]] und mit der festeren [[Territorialisierung|Begrenzung des Territorialbestandes]] der einzelnen Herrschaften die eigentlichen Landstände aus den eingesessenen Herren, [[Vasall]]en und [[Ministeriale]]n heraus.&lt;ref name="Pierer"&gt;Pierer's Universal-Lexikon, Band 10. Altenburg 1860, S. 91-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Diese fingen an, sich über ihre Rechte und Freiheiten von den Landesherrn urkundliche Zusicherungen erteilen zu lassen und schlossen untereinander Bündnisse zur Wahrung ihrer eigenen Rechte und Freiheiten.&lt;ref name="Götzinger" /&gt;

Für den Zusammenschluss zu festen Organisationen bestanden verschiedene Gründe. Zum einen verlangten die Landesherren jetzt häufig Steuern und die größeren Grundbesitzer, wollten sich von dem Landesherrn bestimmtere Versprechungen über die künftige Anlegung der Steuern geben lassen.&lt;ref name="Pierer" /&gt; Zum anderen waren Streitigkeiten über [[Sukzession]]sverhältnisse, der Übergang des Landes an einen neuen Herrn oder die Wiedervereinigung getrennter Landesteile Veranlassung zur Bildung einer festen Vereinigung.&lt;ref name="Pierer" /&gt; Aus den dabei gewonnenen Privilegien bildete sich nach und nach eine Summe von Landesfreiheiten der Landstände gegenüber den Landesherren heraus.

Im 15. und 16. Jahrhundert wuchs der Einfluss der Landstände. Die [[Landesherr]]en waren wegen der Beschränktheit ihrer eigenen Mittel oft auf die Unterstützung ihrer Landstände angewiesen, womit diese an Bedeutung gewannen. Daher traten die Landstände im 15. und 16. Jahrhundert häufig sogar als wirkliche [[Mitregent]]en auf und beschäftigten sich mit allen wichtigeren Angelegenheiten, selbst solchen, die zunächst nur die fürstliche Familie angingen.&lt;ref name="Pierer" /&gt; Aus der ursprünglichen Pflicht der Vasallen, ihren Lehnsherrn in bestimmten Fällen mit besonderen Leistungen zu unterstützen, entwickelte sich das Steuerbewilligungsrecht der Landstände.&lt;ref name="Meyers"&gt;Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon, Band 12. Leipzig 1908, S. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Es folgte die Gründung eigener landschaftlicher Kassen, in die zunächst die bewilligten Steuern eingezahlt wurden, um von da aus erst in die fürstlichen Kassen übergeführt zu werden. Für die Abwicklung setzten die Landstände vielfach ständig tagende Gremien (genannt Collegium, Ausschuss, Kommissariat, Verordnung usw.) ein und bauten repräsentative Gebäude.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_45078 Maximilian Lanzinner, Landstände, in: Historisches Lexikon Bayerns]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Niedergang der Landstände ===
Im 17. Jahrhundert begann durch den [[Dreißigjähriger Krieg|Dreißigjährigen Krieg]] der Niedergang der Landstände in den meisten deutschen Staaten.&lt;ref name="Herders" /&gt; Dieser setzte sich im 18. Jahrhundert fort.

Mit der wachsenden Macht des Landesfürstentums (gemäß den Vorstellungen des [[Absolutismus]]) und der Entwickelung eines fürstlichen Beamtenstandes sank die Macht der Landstände, die in vielen Territorien fast bedeutungslos wurde, in andern Gebieten aber auch im 18. Jahrhundert noch großen Einfluss auf die Landesverwaltung besaßen.&lt;ref name="Meyers" /&gt; Dazu trug besonders die völlige Veränderung des Kriegswesens bei, welche die Macht in den Händen der Landesherren konzentrierte. Zudem beschränkte die Reichsgesetzgebung die Selbständigkeit der Landstände.&lt;ref name="Pierer" /&gt;

In Württemberg erhielt sich ihre volle Wirksamkeit bis 1805.&lt;ref name="Herders" /&gt; Im [[Königreich Sachsen]] behielten die Landstände bis zur Einführung der konstitutionellen Verfassung 1831 ihre Vormachtstellung. In [[Geschichte Mecklenburgs|Mecklenburg]] konnten die Landstände sogar bis 1918 ihre Macht erhalten. In Niedersachsen existieren „[[Landschaften und Landschaftsverbände in Niedersachsen|Landschaften]]“ mit ständischer Verfassung bis heute fort.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18737">The official languages of Belarus are equally Belarusian and Russian.

The language situation in [[Belarus]] is characterized by a co-existence of several linguistic codes. The two most widespread codes are [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and the so-called [[trasianka]], a form of mixed speech in which Belarusian and Russian elements and structures alternate in rapid succession.&lt;ref name="Congruence"&gt;Hentschel, G. (2014) Belarusian and Russian in the Mixed Speech of Belarus. In: Besters-Dilger, J. et al. (eds.): Congruence in Contact-Induced Language Change: Language Families, Typological Resemblance, and Perceived Similarity. Berlin/Boston, 93-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest known documents from ethnic Belarusian territories date from the 12th century.&lt;ref name="McMillin"&gt;McMillin, A. (1980): Belorussian. In: Schenker, A. &amp; E. Stankiewicz (ed.): The Slavic literary languages. Formation and development. New Haven, 105-117.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them are saints' vitae and sermons written in the [[Church Slavonic language]]. In the 13th and 14th century an increasing number of texts, mainly official records and other types of documents, show phonetic, grammatical and lexical characteristics regarded as typically Belarusian.&lt;ref name="Pryhodzič"&gt;Pryhodzič, M. (1998): Z historyi belaruskaj movy i jaje vyvučėnnja. In: Lukašanec, A. et al. (rėd.): Belaruskaja mova. Opole, 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ongoing scientific discussion about the share of elements from, on one hand, Church Slavonic, on the other hand from autochthonous East Slavonic vernaculars in early East Slavonic texts. In general, however, it can be said that these shares depended on text genres and their evaluation as "high" or "low": In "high" - mainly religious - text genres Church Slavonic prevailed, while in "low" text genres - texts of an everyday nature - the influence of East Slavonic vernaculars dominated.&lt;ref name="Uspenskij"&gt;Uspenskij, B. (1987): Istorija russkogo literaturnogo jazyka (XI-XVII vv.), München.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 14th and in the 15th century the Church Slavonic religious writings in East Slavonic territories underwent an archaization known as [[rebulgarisation]]. The purpose of this archaization was to counteract the "falsification" of the divine word which allegedly had been caused by the influence of vernaculars.&lt;ref name="Birnbaum"&gt;Birnbaum, H. (1975): On the significance of the second south Slavic influence for the evolution of the Russian literary language. In: International Journal of Slavic Linguistics and Poetics 21 (1975), 23-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Rebulgarisation made Church Slavonic even less comprehensible to the population at large than it already was due to its complex syntax structures and its high share of abstract lexicon. This and the political rise of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] with its Slavic majority population contributed to the emergence of a written language on an autochthonous East Slavonic basis. This language emerged as a [[Koiné language]] from vernaculars bordering the administrative centers of the Grand Duchy.&lt;ref name="Koine"&gt;Cychun, H. (2002): Weißrussisch. In: Okuka, M. (Hrsg.): Lexikon der Sprachen des europäischen Ostens. Klagenfurt, 563-579.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the [[official language]] of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and was used in particular by the authorities, in offices and in diplomatic correspondence, but in the course of time it entered former "exclusive" domains of Church Slavonic as well.  In contemporary sources it was referred to as "ruskij jazyk", which serves pro-Russian linguistic historiography as an argument to claim it as a part of the history of the [[Russian language]].&lt;ref name="Unentbehrliches Russisch"&gt;Brüggemann, M. (2013): Unentbehrliches Russisch, entbehrliches Weißrussisch? Russophone zur Sprachgeschichte und Sprachverwendung in Weißrussland. In: Kempgen, S. et al. (Hrsg.): Deutsche Beiträge zum 15. Internationalen Slavistenkongress Minsk 2013. München etc., 89-98.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, pro-Belarusian linguistic historiography claims "ruskij jazyk" as "Old Belarusian language" ("starabelaruskaja mova"), which is problematic as well insofar as at that time no distinct Belarusian identity in today's sense of the term had evolved.&lt;ref name="Plokhy"&gt;Plokhy, S. (2006): The origins of the Slavic nations: Premodern identities in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from that the term [[Ruthenian language]] is in use, although the latter often refers only to the southern (from today's perspective: Ukrainian) variant of the state language of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

After the [[Union of Lublin]] and the [[Union of Brest]] the influence of [[Polish language]] and culture in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania increased at the cost of Ruthenian, the use of which in official documents of the Grand Duchy was forbidden in 1696. Subsequently, linguistic elements of Belarusian were perpetuated mainly in vernaculars and folklore passed on by word of mouth. After the [[Partitions of Poland]] initially Polish remained the social dominant language in Belarus being more and more replaced in this role by Russian, in particular after the [[November Uprising]].

As part of the movement of [[Romanticism]] in the 19th century poets and intellectuals with origin from today's Belarus were inspired by the language use of the peasantry and contributed to a new basis for a modern Belarusian literary language, which was only partly connected to the official language of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.&lt;ref name="Dingley"&gt;Dingley, J. (2001): Sprachen in Weißrußland bis zum Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts. In: Beyrau, D. &amp; R. Lindner. (Hrsg.): Handbuch der Geschichte Weißrußlands. Göttingen, 437-450.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[language policy]] of the [[Russian Empire]] treated Belarusian as a dialect of Russian. After the [[January Uprising]] of 1863, in which Belarusians participated as well, all - for the time being tentative - steps toward a Belarusian linguistic and cultural emancipation were blocked by the authorities.&lt;ref name="Dissertation Brüggemann"&gt;Brüggemann, M. (2014): Die weißrussische und die russische Sprache in ihrem Verhältnis zur weißrussischen Gesellschaft und Nation. Ideologisch-programmatische Standpunkte politischer Akteure und Intellektueller 1994-2010. Oldenburg (Studia Slavica Oldenburgensia 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts for the creation of a modern Belarusian literary language intensified after the liberalizations following the [[1905 Russian Revolution]] when inter alia the ban on printed texts in Belarusian was lifted.&lt;ref name="Gutschmidt"&gt;Gutschmidt, K. (2000): Sprachenpolitik und sprachliche Situation in Weißrußland seit 1989. In: Panzer, B. (Hrsg.): Die sprachliche Situation in der Slavia zehn Jahre nach der Wende. Frankfurt/Main etc., 67-84.&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental role for the development of literary norms in modern Belarusian played the newspaper [[Nasha Niva]] (published 1906-1915), contributors of which were the leading intellectuals of the Belarusian national movement at that time. As a school subject and language of instruction Belarusian was first introduced under German occupation in the district [[Ober Ost]], which existed from 1915 to 1918.&lt;ref name="Koine"/&gt;

According with the principles of Lenin's nationality policy in the early years of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (BSSR), i.e. in the 1920s, a policy was carried out which aimed at the [[Belarusization]] of public life as well as at the terminological development of the Belarusian language.&lt;ref name="Gutschmidt"/&gt;  In the early 1930s Soviet state and party leaders began their ideological struggle against alleged "local nationalisms", putting an end to Belarusization and resulting in grave repressions and physical elimination of the pro-Belarusian intelligentsiya in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name="Plotnikau"&gt;Plotnikaŭ, B. (2000): Äußere Ursachen für die begrenzte Verwendung der weißrussischen Sprache. In: Die Welt der Slaven 45 (2000), 49-58.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 Russian was declared language of interethnic communication for the whole territory of the [[Soviet Union]], and in 1938 Russian was introduced as an obligatory subject in all schools in non-Russian Soviet republics.&lt;ref name="Koine"/&gt; In [[West Belarus]], which in the inter-war period was part of the Polish territory, policy aimed at a long-term assimilation of Belarusians through the medium of Polish education and the influence of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="Bieder 2000"&gt;Bieder, H. (2000): Konfession, Ethnie und Sprache in Weißrußland im 20. Jahrhundert. In: Zeitschrift für Slawistik 45 (2000), 200-214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of great importance for the development of the linguistic situation in the decades after [[World War II]] were the [[industrialisation]] and [[urbanization]] of the BSSR, part of which became the Western Belarusian territories formerly belonging to Poland. For the first time Belarusians became the majority population in the urban centers, in which Russian, Jewish and Polish influences had prevailed before World War II.&lt;ref name="Europa ethnica"&gt;Brüggemann, M. (2014): Zwischen Anlehnung an Russland und Eigenständigkeit: Zur Sprachpolitik in Belarus'. In: Europa ethnica 3-4 (2014), 88-94.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the BSSR became the Soviet republic with the highest share of immigrants from the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR). Specialists from the RSFSR as well as other Russian-speaking "non-Belarusians" often held leadership positions in the post-war BSSR, thus contributing to the role of Russian as the language of social advance. This caused migrants from the Belarusian countryside to the cities to give up their dialectal Belarusian and adjust to the Russian-speaking environment. This way the Belarusian-Russian mixed speech [[trasianka]] spread and was perpetuated to the following speaker generation.&lt;ref name="Inzest"&gt;Hentschel, G. et al. (2014): Trasjanka und Suržyk - gemischte weißrussisch-russische und ukrainisch-russische Rede: Sprachlicher Inzest in Weißrussland und der Ukraine? Frankfurt/Main etc.&lt;/ref&gt; A law passed by the [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus|Supreme Soviet of the BSSR]] in 1959 allowed pupils taught in schools with Russian as medium of instruction to opt out of Belarusian as a school subject. In 1978 the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union]] decided to introduce Russian as a school subject already in all first grades of "non-Russian" schools, thus further weakening the position of Belarusian.&lt;ref name="Zaprudski"&gt;Zaprudski, S. (2007): In the grip of replacive bilingualism: the Belarusian language in contact with Russian. In: International Journal of the Sociology of Language 183 (2007), 97-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of [[perestroika]] an improvement of the legal and actual status of the Belarusian language became an important demand of the nationally orientated intelligentsiya, which began to organize itself in the Belarusian Popular Front and, with a narrower focus on language, the [[Frantsishak Skaryna Belarusian Language Society]]. Under the pressure of this "national rebirth" movement in 1990 the Supreme Soviet of the BSSR passed a language law which declared Belarusian the sole official language of the BSSR.

== Development since the collapse of the Soviet Union ==

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991 the Belarusian language law remained in force, and a Belarusization policy was initiated which aimed at linguistic Belarusization of the most important areas of public life within ten years. Particular attention was drawn to the educational system.&lt;ref name="Zaprudski 2000"&gt;Zaprudski, S. (2000): Language policy in the Republic of Belarus in the 1990s, http://www.belarusguide.com/culture1/literature/Belarusian_Language_Prosecution_in_Belarus.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This policy, however, was rejected by large parts of the society, and this prompted [[Alexander Lukashenko]] to take up the issue of allegedly "forceful Belarusization" in his first presidential campaign in 1994. After being elected, in 1995 Lukashenko initiated - under democratically disputable circumstances - a [[Belarusian referendum, 1995|referendum]] in which according to official data 88.3% of the participants supported an equal status for the Russian and Belarusian language.&lt;ref name="Zaprudski 2000"/&gt; The revised language law names Russian in addition to Belarusian as official language of Belarus. Following the referendum, the policy of positive discrimination in favor of Belarusian came to an end, as according to the revised language law in all substantial domains of public life either Russian or Belarusian could be used. Due to the long-lasting dominance of Russian in Belarus this legal "equality" of the two official languages in fact resulted in an almost exclusive use of the Russian language in public life, except for few niches. In particular in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s the public use of Belarusian outside the spheres of education and culture became a symbol of an oppositional ("Anti-Lukashenko") attitude. This was reinforced by some disrespectful statements Lukashenko made about the Belarusian language.&lt;ref name="Dissertation Brüggemann"/&gt; In light of several political and economic conflicts with [[Russia]] since the middle of the 2000s and, more recently, the role of Russia in the [[war in Donbass]] Belarusian officials have started to use a more favourable rhetoric with respect to the Belarusian language. However, this has not resulted in a fundamental change of the actual language policy in Belarus.&lt;ref name="Europa ethnica"/&gt;

In the Belarusian population [[census]]es of 1999 and 2009 respondents were asked about their native language and about the language they usually speak at home. In 1999 85.6% of the citizens with Belarusian nationality declared Belarusian, 14.3% declared Russian as their native language, in 2009 these shares were 60.8% for Belarusian and 37.0% for Russian. As language they usually speak at home in 1999 41.3% of Belarusians declared Belarusian, 58.6% Russian, in 2009 these shares were 26.1% for Belarusian and 69.8% for Russian.&lt;ref name="Europa ethnica"/&gt; A recent research project at the [[University of Oldenburg]] has pointed out the unreliability of the language-related questions in the Belarusian censuses and included in its own surveys [[trasianka]] (named neutrally as "Belarusian-Russian mixed language") as an answer category in addition to Russian and Belarusian. Moreover, multiple answers were allowed. Asked about their native language, around 49% of Belarusians chose Belarusian, 38% trasianka and 30% Russian.&lt;ref name="Wien"&gt;Hentschel, G. &amp; B. Kittel (2011): Weißrussische Dreisprachigkeit? Zur sprachlichen Situation in Weißrussland auf der Basis von Urteilen von Weißrussen über die Verbreitung ihrer Sprachen im Lande. In: Wiener Slawistischer Almanach 67 (2011), 107-135.&lt;/ref&gt; As language(s) of their first socialization, around 50% of Belarusians named trasianka, 42% Russian and 18% Belarusian. As language predominantly used - in this category multiple answers were not allowed - 55% of the respondents with Belarusian national identity chose Russian, 41% trasianka and 4% Belarusian.

Apart from Russian, Belarusian and trasianka the languages of national minorities are used in Belarus, but to a much lesser extent. According to the Belarusian census of 2009 the overwhelming majority of non-Belarusians use Russian in their everyday life.

{{Lebanese people}}

The arrival of [[immigrants]] of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] origin to [[Paraguay]] consisted of a large number of people who have settled in this country, bringing their customs and way of life.  Many were the reasons which prompted these people to leave their native [[Lebanon]] and migrate to several Latin American countries, with the aim to seek a better quality of life after the [[World War I]] and the [[Second World War]]. In modern day, the large amount of Lebanese immigrants to Paraguay reside in [[Ciudad del Este]], alongside neighbor city [[Foz do Iguaçu]] in Brazil, which has a large population of Lebanese immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.viajeabrasil.com/foz-de-iguazu/mezquita-musulmana-en-foz-de-iguazu.php&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanon has an embassy in the city of Asunción,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mre.gov.py/v2/Contenido/327/embajada-de-la-republica-libanesa&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Paraguay has an embassy in the city of Beirut.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mre.gov.py/v2/Noticia/2812/embajada-de-paraguay-en-libano-ofrecio-una-recepcion-por-los-204-anos-de-la-independencia-patria&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1943–1960===
[[Image:Libaneses en Paraguay.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Lebanese in Paraguay]]
After the First World War it passed to the hands of the [[French people|French]], from which it gained its independence on October 22, 1943, even though it declared its independence, the actions of the Second World War did not allow that this were fully effective until 1946. The intervention of Lebanon in the [[Arab-Israeli War]] 1948, its moral support to the Arabs in the Arab-Israeli [[Six Days of War|War of Six Days]] (1967) and the arrival in the country of many Palestinians, have meant a constant hostility with neighboring [[Israel]], first in 1970 and then in 1982, triggering the latter occasion in a bout in [[Beirut]], which did not cease until the departure from Lebanon of Palestinian guerrillas. This situation resulted from immigration of many Lebanese in the late nineteenth century and the beginning of the century in search of a better perspective of life. With effort they managed to succeed in a different society from their culture. The immigration of the Lebanese to Paraguay can be divided into two eras: ancient and modern. Among the reasons which prompted the uprooting  are included both the political reason, and also the economic one. The political reason responds to the need to escape the troubled relations that have emerged during the Ottoman Empire in the region. 
The economic reason lies in the many disappointments and poverty, the consequences of [[World War I]]. The strategic position of Lebanon in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] has meant ongoing invasions. It was part of [[Syria]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] until 1918. In a second term after the Second World War, where thousands of people, mostly men, took the decision to leave the mother homeland because of the havoc that the war had caused. In this journey towards finding a better future, they had to undertake long voyages in boats, often without knowing where they embark and disembark where it was even worse. In these trips they had to deal with many troubles, diseases and nostalgia. They were forced to withstand natural disasters of all kinds in the middle of the sea.

===Arrival to Paraguay (1960–1970)===
[[Image:Libaneses en Paraguay 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Group of Lebanese immigrants]] 
Their first destination was the harbour of [[Buenos Aires]] [[Argentina]] where they arrived without even speaking Spanish and without knowing its customs. But they did not take much to adapt and strive to rebuild a decent life, forming households and having children without forgetting their roots. They were organized in groups and communities, in order to find the best place to settle. Following trips by rivers or on trains until they came to Paraguay and then distributed in various places of the country where trade could be a prominent occupation. They settle in [[Asuncion]], the country's capital, and also in [[Concepción, Paraguay|Concepcion]], [[Puerto Rosario]], [[Villarrica, Paraguay|Villarrica]], [[Itacurubi del Rosario]], [[Encarnación, Paraguay|Encarnacion]], [[San Estanislao]], [[Pedro Juan Caballero, Paraguay|Pedro Juan Caballero]], [[Caraguatay, Paraguay|Caraguatay]] and other cities. Mixing with Paraguayan society and after much effort and work they could open shops, factories or cultivate the land. They dedicated not only learn the Castilian but also the Guaraní, they fought in the [[Chaco War]], participated with their civilization and helped build the country. They joined their lives in marriage to men and women of Paraguay and respected the cultural identity of the country that hosted them. They taught their children the values of love for the two cultures, which created clubs and associations that still preserve their traditions. The last major contingent of immigrants arrived in Paraguay in the late 60s and early 70s.

===1970–onwards===
The majority of Lebanese-Paraguayans are [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christians]] who belong to the [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite Church]], [[Roman Catholicism in Lebanon|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Melkite Christianity in Lebanon|Melkite Catholic]]. A scant number are [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslims]]. In addition to being of Lebanese descent, there are Paraguayans of Syrian and Palestinian origin as well.&lt;ref&gt;John Tofik Karam, "On the Trail and Trial of a Palestinian Diaspora: Mapping South America in the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1967-1972" http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9070730&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1970s, Sunni Muslim Arabs moved to the Ciudad del Este. This changed in the 1980s to Shia Muslim Arabs from South Lebanon.

In 2010, Ciudad del Este's INTERPOL office had captured a Lebanese man of 37 years, Moussa Ali Hamdan, accused of terrorism in the city centre of Ciudad del Este. He was under an order of capture by the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aquiagora.net/noticias/ver/8500/&lt;/ref&gt; It was also suspected that Hamdan financed terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.com.py/articulos/la-interpol-detuvo-en-ciudad-del-este-al-libanes-moussa-hamdan-supuesto-financista-del-terrorismo-117366.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emol.com/noticias/internacional/2010/06/15/419150/libanes-reclamado-por-eeuu-fue-detenido-en-paraguay.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://americaeconomia.com/politica-sociedad/sociedad/paraguay-detiene-libanes-buscado-por-eeuu&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a Lebanese man was arrested at the regional office of Interpol in Ciudad del Este because of identification problems, having been explused from [[France]]. The man said that his name was Toufic Harb but his real identity is Zidane Khaleb.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ultimahora.com/libanes-doble-identidad-esta-preso-interpol-n409867.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured at the [[Guaraní International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ultimahora.com/libanes-doble-identidad-esta-preso-interpol-n409867.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 article published on terrorists in Paraguay, [[Al Jazeera English|Al Jazeera]] reported that Hezbollah "remained especially active" in the tri-border area of Argentina–Paraguay–Brazil. José Almada, a superior officer in the Paraguayan Special Operations Group (GEO) said that they had not uncovered any evidence of terrorist cells in Ciudad del Este.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/05/2013512105822488194.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, ABC Color published an article in which the Lebanese community question the utilization of students of the Lebanese Educational Centre of Paraguay in Ciudad del Este, in acts of political movements linked to terrorist group Hezbolá. Members of the Lebanese community in the region expressed their disagreement with the way the institute is run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/interior/consideran-que-colegio-libanes-aplica-un-regimen-tipo-taliban-1218878.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 November 2015, [[International Islamic News Agency]] announced Paraguay's president [[Horacio Cartes]] inaugurated the largest mosque, which was built in Ciudad del Este. The opening ceremont of the mosque saw the involvement of a large amount of political officials, as well as diplomats. The mosque itself costed US$1 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iinanews.com/page/public/news_details.aspx?id=104424#&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beautifulmosque.com/Ibrahim-Mosque-in-Ciudad-del-Este-Paraguay&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surnames==
Many Arabic surnames from [[Lebanon]] today stand out in Paraguayan society as political leaders, national authorities, businessmen, writers and people dedicated to the arts in general. Some of these surnames were modified to improve their pronunciation in Spanish but many retain their original identity.

Common surnames are:

Aboud, Aid, Armel, Arar, Rossi, Atat, Ayala, Azar, Barchini, Buzarquis, Canan/Kanan, Nader, Cofure, Curi/Kuri/Juri, Daher, Damus, Diaz, Dibb, Elias, Esgaib/Zgaib, Esquef/Skef, Fadlala, Fadul, Farah, Garcia, Ghobril, Giral, Gosen/Gosn/Ghosn/Hosen, Haddad, Haitter/Haidar, Harare, Host, Ismael/Ysmail, Kalfat, Mohur, Maluff, Mancos, Mende, Musi, Ouchana, Rahi, Resck/Risk, Rosas, Sabag, Safua, Sardi, Seif din, Serrano, Yambay/Yampey, Yanho, Yauhari, Yore, Yunis.

Button &amp; Sons, Waterford NY - Lyman &amp; Merrie Wood Museum of Springfield History - DSC04148]]

'''Lysander Button''' (September 2, 1810 – July 29, 1898) was the inventor of many of the early improvements made on hand and steam [[fire engines]]. Many of those improvements made their way to the modern fire engines of today.

Button was born in [[North Haven, Connecticut]] on September 2, 1810 but moved with his parents to [[Albany, New York|Albany]] by 1825. After John Rogers relocated his machine shop from Albany to a spot on King’s Canal in [[Waterford (town), New York|Waterford]], [[Saratoga County, New York]], Button found a job there as a machinist. Rogers manufactured fire engines and had even submitted two [[patents]] in the 1830s (the copies of which have unfortunately been lost). Rogers sold the shop to William Platt and Judge Nicholas Doe, who expanded the product line to include other castings such as iron water wheels. Without the advantages of a formal education, Button became foreman in the shop by 1833 and was named a partner the following year.

In 1841, Platt sold his share of the business to Button, who became the sole owner after Judge Doe died. For the next fifteen years the business was known as L. Button &amp; Company, which continued to operate on Kings Canal. Button later moved to a steam-powered building on Third Street in the Village of [[Waterford (village), New York|Waterford]].&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Modern Steam Fire Engines, Roper, 1897&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of his innovations were for the so-called “hand-pumper” fire engines. He possessed remarkable gifts in mechanical engineering, since by 1838 he had developed the first “piano engine” which delivered water from the front end of the trunk of the device. Another notable improvement was the “runaround” that returned water to the suction to relieve pressure on the hose. In 1841 he developed the first fire engine water pump, with valves set at an angle of 45 degrees and straight-level waterways from the inlet to the outlet.&lt;ref&gt;Standard of the Age, Utter, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon coming of age, Lysander’s eldest son Theodore became involved with the company, and the name was changed to Button &amp; Son. From 1873 to 1891 Theodore submitted some half a dozen patents, including improvements in hose and pipe couplings, feed water regulators, and steam engines. Two patents were assigned to his brother Charles, who seems to have remained affiliated with the [[fire engine]] business even after it was sold to other parties.

In 1876, the Button Steamer won the Centennial Award at the [[Philadelphia]] International Exhibition for its simplicity, strength, and reliability. However, after spending almost half a century manufacturing fire engines, Lysander decided to retire in 1882 and sell the entire works, including the rights to his many patents, to Holroyd &amp; Company of [[Waterford]].

Years later, Button fire engines continued to be manufactured by the American Fire Engine Company, which was formed in 1891 by the consolidation of the Button Fire Engine Works, Silsby Manufacturing Company, Ahrens Manufacturing Company, and Clapp &amp; Jones. In 1900, a group of New York investors formed the International Fire Engine Company, which included American Fire Engine, LaFrance Fire Engine Company, and Thomas Manning Jr. &amp; Company.

Button and his wife Abigail Ranney had five children: May Josephine, Eliza, Theodore, Julia, and Charles. After retiring, Lysander took a special interest in local schools by serving on the Board of Trustees and advocating for clean water in the school system. He was also prominent in the [[Presbyterian]] Church, becoming a ruling elder. He was superintendent of the Sunday school for 25 years and was a teacher there until within one year of his death, which occurred on July 29, 1898. Thousands of Button fire engines were sold throughout the world, and many still exist in working condition, used for parades and in contests. The [[Waterford]] Historical Museum was able to obtain the Button &amp; Blake hand pumper called the “Converse” in 2005 so that history fans now and in the future may see an original Button fire engine in person.&lt;ref&gt;Invented in Saratoga County, Starr, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Madeleine May Kunin''' (born September 28, 1933) is an American diplomat, author and politician. She served as the [[List of Governors of Vermont|77th]] [[Governor of Vermont]] from 1985 until 1991, as a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. She also served as [[United States Ambassador to Switzerland]] from 1996 to 1999. She was Vermont's first and, to date, only [[List of female state governors in the United States|female governor]] as well as the first [[Jewish]] governor of Vermont. She was also the first Jewish woman to be elected governor of a U.S. state. Kunin is currently a James Marsh Professor-at-Large at the [[University of Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/president/marsh/|title=James Marsh Professors-at-Large Program : University of Vermont|first=University of|last=Vermont|publisher=|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
Kunin was born in [[Zürich]], the daughter of Renee (Bloch) and Ferdinand May. Her family was Jewish. She moved to the United States as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/madeleine-may-kunin|title=Madeleine May Kunin Facts|publisher=|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her bachelor's degree in history from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] (1956), a master's degree from the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]], and a master's degree in English from the [[University of Vermont]]. Prior to seeking elective office, she worked as a journalist for ''[[The Burlington Free Press]]'', as a tour guide at the World's Fair, and as a part-time college professor.  She was also involved in community activities, particularly in the area of women's rights, children, and literature. In 2012 her book, ''The New Feminist Agenda: Defining the Next Revolution for Women, Work, and Family'', was published by Chelsea Green Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyjournalofbooks.com/review/new-feminist-agenda-defining-next-revolution-women-work-and-family|title=a book review by Elayne Clift: The New Feminist Agenda: Defining the Next Revolution for Women, Work, and Family|last=Clift|first=Elayne|date=|website=New York Journal of Books|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political career ===
In 1972, Kunin was defeated in her bid to join the [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]] [[Board of Aldermen]].  Later that year she was elected a [[Vermont State Representative]], where in her first term she served as a member of the Government Operations Committee.  Following her reelection in 1974, she was elected [[Minority Whip]] of the State House and appointed to the Appropriations Committee.  After being elected to a third term in 1976, she was appointed Chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, the first woman to assume this position.  Kunin has written that when she served on the Appropriations Committee during his chairmanship, [[Emory A. Hebard]], a conservative Republican who later served as [[Vermont State Treasurer]], was a mentor, and gave her significant responsibilities despite her status as a member of the minority Democrats.  When Hebard left the House, he successfully lobbied his former colleagues to name Kunin as chairwoman of the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kunin |first=Madeleine |date=2012 |title=The New Feminist Agenda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8LPgkZm6rsC&amp;pg=PA177 |location=White River Junction, VT |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing |pages=176–177 |isbn=978-1-60358-425-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 she was elected to the first of two terms as the [[List of lieutenant governors of Vermont|74th Lieutenant Governor of Vermont]]. Serving with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Richard Snelling]], Kunin primarily served as President of the State Senate and worked with citizens around the state.  She produced various studies in areas such as energy and day care and made policy recommendations to the Governor and Legislature.  Kunin was a frequent speaker statewide during her time as lieutenant governor.

Kunin did not run for reelection as lieutenant governor in 1982, instead challenging Snelling for the governorship.  She was unsuccessful, but in 1984 Snelling did not run for reelection, and Kunin was the successful Democratic nominee, defeating Republican [[John J. Easton, Jr.]] to win the first of her three terms as governor.

In 1986 Kunin ran for her second term as governor. Her opponents were Republican [[Peter Plympton Smith]] and independent [[Bernie Sanders]]. Smith received 38 percent of the vote, Sanders 14 percent, and Kunin won with 47 percent of the vote.&lt;ref name="When Bernie Sanders ran against me in Vermont"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kunin|first1=Madeleine May|title=When Bernie Sanders ran against me in Vermont|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/02/04/when-bernie-sanders-ran-against-vermont/kNP6xUupbQ3Qbg9UUelvVM/story.html|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=3 April 2016|date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the first woman in U.S. history to have been elected governor of a U.S. state three times. As governor she focused on the environment, education, and children's issues.  She appointed the first woman to the [[Vermont Supreme Court]] and created her state's [[family court]] system.  She declined to seek reelection in 1990.

She was a member of the administration of President [[Bill Clinton]], serving as [[United States Deputy Secretary of Education|deputy secretary of education]] of the United States from 1993 until 1997, when she became the ambassador to her native Switzerland, as well as to [[Liechtenstein]]. Prior to joining the Clinton Administration she worked in Clinton's campaign as a member of the search committee for the Vice Presidential nominee and on the transition team.

== Personal life ==
Kunin is the author of the books [http://www.chelseagreen.com/bookstore/item/the_new_feminist_agenda ''The New Feminist Agenda: Defining the Next Revolution for Women, Work, and Family''] (2012), ''[http://www.chelseagreen.com/bookstore/item/pearls_politics_and_power:paperback Pearls, Politics, and Power: How Women Can Win and Lead]'' (2008) and  ''Living a Political Life'' (1995) which chronicles her career prior to joining the U.S. Department of Education. She is a resident of [[Burlington, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madeleinekunin.org/Excerpt.htm|title=Pearls, Politics, and Power - How Women Can Win and Lead - Introduction|last=Kunin|first=Madeleine|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kunin is the mother of four children: Julia, Peter, Adam, and Daniel. She divorced her first husband, professor and former First Gentleman of Vermont Arthur Kunin, in 1995. She married [[John W. Hennessey Jr]], a professor at [[Dartmouth College]], in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/fashion/weddings/26vows.html|title=Madeleine Kunin and John Hennessey|last=Calta|first=Marialisa|date=February 26, 2006|work=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Kunin was the sister of the late [[Edgar May]], who was a [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning journalist and a member of both the [[Vermont House of Representatives]] and [[Vermont State Senate]].

== Awards and honors ==
Governor Kunin has received more than twenty honorary degrees.

Kunin is a recipient of the International Center in New York's Award of Excellence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In addition to its classical and literary form, [[Malayan languages|Malay]] had various regional dialects established before the rise of the [[Malaccan Sultanate]]. Also, Malay spread through interethnic contact and trade across the Malay archipelago as far as the Philippines. That contact resulted in a [[lingua franca]] that was called ''Bazaar Malay'' or ''low Malay'' and in Malay ''Melayu Pasar''. It is generally believed that Bazaar Malay was a [[pidgin]], influenced by contact among Malay, Chinese, Portuguese, and Dutch traders.

Besides the general simplification that occurs with pidgins, the Malay lingua franca had several distinctive characteristics. One was that possessives were formed with ''punya'' 'its owner'; another was that plural pronouns were formed with ''orang'' 'person'. The only Malayic affixes that remained productive were ''tər-'' and ''bər-''.

Other features:
*''Ada'' became a [[progressive aspect|progressive]] particle.
*Reduced forms of ''ini'' 'this' and ''itu'' 'that' before a noun became determiners.
*The verb ''pərgi'' 'go' was reduced, and became a preposition 'towards'.
*[[Causative]] constructions were formed with ''kasi'' or ''bəri'' 'to give' or ''bikin'' or ''buat'' 'to make'.
*A single preposition, often ''sama'', was used for multiple functions, including direct and indirect object.&lt;ref name=wurm&gt;Wurm, Mühlhäusler, &amp; Tryon, ''Atlas of languages of intercultural communication in the Pacific, Asia and the Americas'', 1996:673''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example,&lt;ref name=sabri&gt;[http://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/library/dialectresearch.pdf MALAY DIALECT RESEARCH IN MALAYSIA: THE ISSUE OF PERSPECTIVE1.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Rumah-ku'' 'my house' becomes ''Saya punya rumah''
* ''Saya pukul dia'' 'I hit him' becomes ''Saya kasi pukul dia''
* ''Megat dipukul Robert'' 'Megat is hit by Robert' becomes ''Megat dipukul dek Robert''

Bazaar Malay is used in a limited extent in Singapore and Malaysia, mostly used among the older generation or people with no working knowledge of English. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apics-online.info/surveys/67|title=APiCS Online - Survey chapter: Singapore Bazaar Malay|last=|first=|date=|website=apics-online.info|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important reason that contributed to the decline of Bazaar Malay is that pidgin Malay has [[creole (linguistics)|creolised]] and created several new languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{glotto|vehi1234|Vehicular Malay}}&lt;/ref&gt;Another reason is due to language shift in both formal and informal contexts, Bazaar Malay is gradually being replaced by English, with English being the lingua franca among the younger generations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Baba Malay''' or '''Peranakan Malay''', once a diverse group of [[pidgin]]s, is spoken in [[Melaka]] but is now almost extinct. These are Malay varieties spoken by the [[Peranakan]], descendants of Chinese settlers who have lived in Melaka since the 15th Century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/malacca.html Baba Malay of Malacca.]&lt;/ref&gt; Baba Malay is close to the trade pidgins which became creolised across the Malay Archipelago, producing the variety of Malay creoles seen today. A kind of Baba Malay, called '''Peranakan''', is spoken among Chinese living in East [[Java]]. It is a mixture of Malay or [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] with local [[Javanese language|Javanese]] (East Javanese dialect) and Chinese elements (particularly [[Hokkien]]). This particular variety is found only in East Java, especially in [[Surabaya]] and surrounding areas. While other Chinese tend to speak the language varieties of the places in which they live (the Chinese of Central Java speak High or Standard Javanese in daily conversation even among themselves; in West Java, they tend to speak [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]), in [[Surabaya]] younger ethnic Chinese people tend to speak pure Javanese (Surabaya dialect) and learn [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] in courses.

There are currently fewer 1,000 Baba Malay speakers in [[Melaka]], and fewer than 1,000 Baba Malay speakers in [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Nala Huiying. 2014. ''A Grammar of Baba Malay with Sociophonetic Considerations''. PhD Dissertation: University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa.&lt;/ref&gt;  Baba Malay is mostly spoken among the older populations.&lt;u&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/mbf|title=Malay, Baba|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

Example (Spoken in [[Surabaya]]):
* ''Kamu mbok ojok gitu!'' : Don't act that way!
* ''Yak apa kabarnya si Eli?'' : How's Eli?
* ''Ntik kamu pigio ambek cecemu ae ya.'' : Go with your sister, okay?
* ''Nih, makanen sakadae.'' : Please have a meal!
* ''Kamu cariken bukune koko ndhek rumahe Ling Ling.'' : Search your brother's book in Ling Ling's house.

==Betawi Malay==
{{main article|Betawi language}}
Betawi Malay, also known as Jakarta or Java Malay, is a creolised-Malay which is spoken in [[Jakarta]] (the modern name for Betawi) and its surroundings. Betawian or ''Omong Betawi'' is based on Bazaar Malay (Melayu Pasar) but influenced by various languages such as [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] (the area is surrounded by Sundanese speaking area), Chinese (especially Hokkien), Portuguese, Dutch, [[Balinese language|Balinese]] and others.  Betawian creole began to be used after 1750 in Batavia, and replaced [[Portuguese creole]] as the ''lingua franca''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://email.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil/12/abstracts/Gil.pdf Why Malay/Indonesian Undressed: Contact, Geography, and the Roll of the Dice, by David Gil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426175057/http://email.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil/12/abstracts/Gil.pdf |date=26 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Betawian Malay was also influenced by Chinese-style Malay spoken by the Chinese settlers who had come earlier.

It has now become a very popular language particularly amongst the younger generations in Indonesia due largely to its use on television (such as ''sinetron'' or ''sitcom'').

Betawi Malay was the ancestor of [[Cocos Malay]].

==Sri Lanka Malay==
{{Main article|Sri Lankan Malay language}}

The [[Sri Lankan Creole Malay language]] is a unique mixture of the [[Sinhalese language]] and the [[Tamil language]] with Malay. Sri Lanka Malay (SLM) is a restructured vernacular of Malay base spoken by at least five different communities in Sri Lanka which has evolved to be significantly divergent from other varieties of Malay due to intimate contact with the dominant languages of Sinhala and Tamil. The Malays in [[Sri Lanka]], whose ancestry include labourers brought by the Dutch and British, as well as soldiers in the Dutch garrison, now constitute 0.3% of the population, numbering some 46,000. It is spoken exclusively by the Malay ethnic minority in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/31/IIASN31_28SilvaJayasuriya.pdf Malays contact with Sri Langka.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singapore Bazaar Malay ==
Singapore Bazaar Malay, also known as Bazaar Malay, Pasar Malay, or Market Malay, is a Malay-lexified pidgin, which is spoken in Singapore. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apics-online.info/surveys/67|title=APiCS Online - Survey chapter: Singapore Bazaar Malay|last=|first=|date=|website=apics-online.info|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamil and Hokkien contributed to the development of Bazaar Malay, with Hokkien being the dominant substrate language of Bazaar Malay, with Malay being the lexifier language. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Platt, John &amp; Weber, Heidi|first=|date=1980|title=English in Singapore and Malaysia: Status, features, functions.|url=|journal=Oxford: Oxford University Press|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many input languages spoken by immigrants that also contributed to the development of Bazaar Malay, including languages spoken by Malays, Chinese, Indians, Eurasians, and Europeans. Singapore Bazaar Malay emerged along with the opening of Singapore's free trade port in 1819, to overcome barriers in communication and business transactions. Since Singapore have four official languages (English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil), Singapore Bazaar Malay not only is a lingua franca in interethnic communication, it is also used in intra-group communication. Singapore Bazaar Malay is mostly spoken by elders and middle-aged workers today, but its language status is declining due to education policies and language campaigns with less than 10,000 speakers. &lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==East Indonesian Malay==
The creoles of eastern Indonesia&lt;ref&gt;{{glotto|east2743|Eastern Indonesia Trade Malay}}&lt;/ref&gt; appear to have formed as Malays and Javanese, using lingua franca Malay, established their monopoly on the spice trade before the European colonial era. They have a number of features in common:
*''ə'' becomes ''a'', ''e'', or assimilates to the following vowel
*''i, u'' lower to ''e, o'' in some environments
*there is a loss of final plosives ''p, t, k'', and the neutralisation of final nasals in part of the lexicon
*the [[perfective]] marker ''sudah'' reduces to ''su'' or ''so''&lt;ref name=wurm/&gt;

For example,&lt;ref name=sabri/&gt;
* ''makan'' becomes ''makang''
* ''pergi'' becomes ''pigi'' or ''pi''
* ''terkejut'' becomes ''takajo''
* ''lembut'' becomes ''lombo''
* ''dapat'' becomes ''dapa''

Bacan (next) is perhaps the most archaic, and appears to be closely related to [[Brunei Malay]] (which is not a creole).

===Manado Malay===
{{main article|Manado Malay}}
Manado Malay is another creole which is the [[lingua franca]] in [[Manado]] and Minahasa, [[North Sulawesi]]. 
It is based on Ternatean Malay and highly influenced by Ternatean, Dutch, Minahasa languages and some Portuguese words.

Examples :
* ''Kita''	= I
* ''Ngana''	= you
* ''Torang''	= we
* ''Dorang''	= they
* ''Io''	= yes
* ''Nyanda' ''	= no (' = glottal stop)

Sentences :
* ''Kita pe mama ada pi ka pasar'' : My mother is going to the market
* ''Ngana so nyanda' makang dari kalamareng'' : You haven't eaten since yesterday.
* ''Ngana jang badusta pa kita'' : Don't lie to me
* ''Torang so pasti bisa'' :  we can surely do that

Gorap is lexically 85% Malay, but has many [[Ternate language|Ternate]] words as well, and word order differs from both Austronesian and [[Halmahera languages]]. Children no longer acquire the language.

===Ternate / North Moluccan Malay===
{{main article|North Moluccan Malay}}
This creole resembles Manado Malay, but with different accents and vocabulary. A large percentage of its vocabulary is borrowed from Ternatean, such as:
ngana : you (sg)
ngoni : you (pl)
bifi  : ant
ciri  : to fall
Spoken in [[Ternate]], [[Tidore]] and [[Halmahera]] islands, [[North Maluku]] for intergroup communications, and in the [[Sula Islands]].

Example :
* ''Jang bafoya'' : Don't lie!

Spoken in [[Kupang]], [[East Nusa Tenggara]], on the west end of Timor Island. It is based on archaic Malay which mixed mostly with Dutch, Portuguese and local languages. Similar to Ambonese Malay with several differences in vocabulary and accent. Its grammatical system resembles that of other East Indonesian Malay Creoles.

Examples :
* ''beta''	= I
* '' lu ''	= You
* '' sonde''	= No
* ''Beta sonde tau, lai'' = I don't know

===Alor Malay===
Alor Malay is spoken in the [[Alor archipelago]]. Speakers perceive Alor Malay to be a different register of standard Indonesian, but both of these are prestige varieties of the archipelago. Many people are able to understand standard Indonesian, but cannot speak it fluently and choose to use Alor Malay on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Baird"&gt;Baird, Louise. 2008. A grammar of Klon: a non-Austronesian language of Alor, Indonesia. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alor Malay is based on Kupang Malay; however, Alor Malay differs significantly from Kupang Malay, especially in its pronouns.&lt;ref name="Klamer_2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Klamer, Marion|editor1-last=Klamer|editor1-first=Marian|contribution=The Alor-Pantar languages: Linguistic context, history and typology.|title=Alor Pantar languages: History and Typology|date=2014|publisher=Language Sciences Press|location=Berlin|pages=5–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambonese Malay===
{{main article|Ambonese Malay}}

Malay was first brought to Ambon by traders from Western Indonesia, then developed into a creole when the Dutch Empire colonised the Molluccas.  Ambonese Malay was the first example of the transliteration of Malay into Roman script, and used as a tool of the missionaries in Eastern Indonesia.

}}

A distinct variant of Moluccan Malay, spoken in [[Banda Islands]], [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]]. Significantly different from Ambonese Malay and for Ambonese, Bandanese Malay tends to be perceived as sounding funny due to its unique features.

Example :
* ''Beta'' : I
* ''pane'' : you
* ''katorang'' : we
* ''mir'' : ants (deviated from Dutch : ''mier'')

===Papuan/Irian Malay===

}}

Originally a contact language among tribes in Indonesian New Guinea ([[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]) for trading and daily communication, now a growing number of native speakers. Papuan and Irian declared Malay as their language since 1926, before the Sumpah Pemuda declaration. Nowadays, they tend to speak more formal [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. This variant is also understood in Vanimo, [[Papua New Guinea]] near Indonesian border.

Example :
* ''Ini tanah pemerintah punya, bukan ko punya!'' = It's governmental land, not yours!
* ''Tong tra pernah bohong'' = We don't lie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25382">'''Mine action''' is a domain within [[humanitarian aid]] and [[development studies]] concerned with activities which aim to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines and the [[Unexploded ordnance|explosive remnants of war]] (ERW). Mine action deals with the many effects of [[landmine]] and ERW contamination on people and societies.
{{TOC limit|4}}

==Description==
Mine action is commonly represented as comprising five complementary groups of activities:
*Humanitarian [[demining]], i.e. mine and ERW survey, land release, mapping, marking and clearance
*Risk education (RE), i.e. the communication to the public of the risk of ERW and how to act in the presence of ERW
*Victim assistance, including rehabilitation and reintegration
*Stockpile destruction
*[[Advocacy]] to promote policies and practices that will reduce the threat from landmines and ERW, usually in the context of [[disarmament]] and [[international humanitarian law]]. The most commonly applied treaties including the [[Ottawa Treaty|1997 anti-personnel Mine Ban Treaty]], the [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]], the [[Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].

The objective of mine action is to reduce the risk caused by landmines and ERW to a level where people can live safely. This state is a situation in which economical, social and health development can occur free from the constraints imposed by landmine and ERW contamination,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mineactionstandards.org/ International Mine Action Standards], Chapter 04.10 - Glossary of mine action terms, definitions and abbreviations&lt;/ref&gt; and in which the victims’ needs can be addressed.[[Gender mainstreaming in mine action]] will ensure that the needs of affected women, girls, boys and men are taken into account and the response tailored accordingly.

The coordination of mine action activities in affected countries is commonly conducted by [[Mine Action Coordination Center]]s (MACC) managed either by the [[United Nations]] or the host country government.

== Pillars ==

=== Clearance of mines and explosive remnants of war ===
In its broad sense, mine clearance includes surveys, mapping and minefield marking, as well as the actual clearance of mines from the ground. This range of activities is also sometimes referred to as [[demining]].

Humanitarian mine clearance aims to clear land so that civilians can return to their homes and their everyday routines without the threat of landmines and unexploded remnants of war (ERW), which include unexploaded ordnance and abandoned explosive ordnance. This means that all the mines and ERW affecting the places where ordinary people live must be cleared, and their safety in areas that have been cleared must be guaranteed.  Mines are cleared and the areas are thoroughly verified so that they can say without a doubt that the land is now safe, and people can use it without worrying about the weapons.   The aim of humanitarian demining is to restore peace and security at the community level.

==== Mine clearance methods ====

===== Surveying =====
Non-technical surveying, or the formal gathering of mine-related information, is required before actual clearance can begin. Impact surveys assess the socio-economic impact of the mine contamination and help assign priorities for the clearance of particular areas. Impact surveys make use of all available sources of information, including minefield records (where they exist), data about mine victims, and interviews with former combatants and local people. Technical surveys then define the minefields and provide detailed maps for the clearance operations.

===== Maps =====
Maps resulting from the impact surveys and technical surveys are stored in an information management system, including a variety of programme databases, and provide baseline data for clearance organisations and operational planning.

===== Minefield marking =====

Minefield marking is carried out when a mined area is identified, but clearance operations cannot take place immediately. Minefield marking, which is intended to deter people from entering mined areas, has to be carried out in combination with mine awareness, so that the local population understands the meaning and importance of the signs.

===== Manual clearance =====
Manual clearance relies on trained deminers using metal detectors and long thin prodders to locate the mines, which are then destroyed by controlled explosion.

===== Mine detection dogs =====
[[File:Dog search for mines in Bosnia.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Dog search for mines in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]
Mine detection dogs, which detect the presence of explosives in the ground by smell. Dogs are used in combination with manual deminers.

===== Mechanical clearance =====
Mechanical clearance relies on [[Mine flail|flail]]s, [[Mine roller|roller]]s, vegetation cutters, and excavators, often attached to armoured bulldozers, to destroy the mines in the ground. These machines can only be used in certain terrains, and are expensive to operate. In most situations they are also not 100% reliable, and the work needs to be checked by other techniques.

=== Mine-risk education (MRE) ===

Mine-risk education, or MRE, refers to educational activities aimed at reducing the risk of injury from mines and unexploded ordnance by raising awareness and promoting behavioural change through public-information campaigns, education and training, and liaison with communities.

MRE ensures that communities are aware of the risks from mines, unexploded ordnance and/or abandoned munitions and are encouraged to behave in ways that reduce the risk to people, property and the environment. Objectives are to reduce the risk to a level where people can live safely and to recreate an environment where economic and social development can occur free from the constraints imposed by landmine contamination.

MRE, along with demining (which includes technical surveys, mapping, clearance of unexploded ordnance and mines, marking unsafe areas, and documenting areas that have been cleared), contributes to mine-risk reduction, or limiting the risk of physical injury from mines and unexploded ordnance that already contaminates the land.   Advocacy and the destruction of landmine stockpiles focus on preventing future use of mines.

According to the Landmine Monitor Report (2009),&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.the-monitor.org/index.php/publications/display?url=lm/2009/ Landmine Monitor Report (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008, MRE was provided in 57 states and areas, compared to 61 states and areas in 2007. However, in the 1999 MRE programs were identified in just 14 states. MRE activities increased significantly in Yemen and Somaliland, and also increased to some degree in 10 other states. In Palestine, RE decreased in 2008 but rose sharply in response to conflict in Gaza in December 2008–January 2009. Some of the main players in MRE include [[Catholic Relief Services]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yen|first=Ta Thi Hai (Catholic Relief Services)|year=2013|title=Catholic Relief Services Develops MRE Materials|journal=[[Journal of ERW and Mine Action]]|volume=17|issue=1|issn=2154-1485|url=http://maic.jmu.edu/journal/17.1/notes/yen.htm|accessdate=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caritas International|German Caritas international]], the [[Mines Advisory Group]], [[Handicap International]], [[Save the Children]], [[INTERSOS]], [[DanChurchAid]], [[Norwegian People's Aid]], the [[Mines Awareness Trust]], Association for Aid and Relief, Japan and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]. Within the UN system [[UNICEF]] is the lead agency for MRE and supports programmes in 30 countries.

International standards have been developed to guide the management of MRE programmes.&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.mineactionstandards.org/imas.htm#english Link to the standards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201144222/http://www.mineactionstandards.org/imas.htm |date=2010-02-01 }})&lt;/ref&gt; These standards emphasize that MRE should typically not be a stand-alone activity; it is an integral part of overall mine-action planning and implementation.

==== Public information dissemination ====

"Public information" in the context of mine action describes landmine and unexploded ordnance situations and informs and updates a broad range of stakeholders.   Such information may focus on local risk-reduction messages, address broader national issues such as complying with legislation or raise public support for mine-action programmes.

Public information "dissemination", however, refers primarily to public-information activities that help reduce the risk of injury from mines and unexploded ordnance by raising awareness of the risk to individuals and communities, and by promoting behavioural change. It is primarily a one-way form of communication transmitted through mass media.   Public information-dissemination initiatives may be stand-alone MRE projects that are implemented in advance of other mine-action activities.

==== Education and training ====

"Education and training" in MRE encompasses all educational and training activities that reduce the risk of injury from mines, unexploded ordnance and/or abandoned munitions by raising awareness of the threat to individuals and communities and promoting behavioural change.    Education and training is a two-way process, which involves the imparting and acquiring of knowledge, changing attitudes and practices through teaching and learning.

Education and training activities may be conducted in formal and non-formal environments: teacher-to-child education in schools, information shared at home from parents to children or from children to their parents, child-to-child education, peer-to-peer education in work and recreational environments, landmine safety training for humanitarian aid workers&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.mineaction.org/overview.asp?o=29 Learn about the Landmine and ERW Safety Project])&lt;/ref&gt; and the incorporation of landmine safety messages in occupational health and safety practices.

==== Community liaison ====

Community liaison refers to the systems and processes used to exchange information between national authorities, mine-action organisations and communities on the presence of mines, unexploded ordnance and abandoned munitions.  It enables communities to be informed about planned demining activities, the nature and duration of the tasks, and the exact locations of marked or cleared areas. Furthermore, it enables communities to inform local authorities and mine-action organizations about the location, extent and impact of contaminated areas.   This information can greatly assist the planning of related activities, such as technical surveys, marking and clearance operations, and survivor-assistance services. Community liaison ensures that mine-action projects address community needs and priorities. Community liaison should be carried out by all organizations conducting mine-action operations.

Community liaison services may begin far in advance of demining activities and help the development of local capacities to assess the risks, manage information and develop risk-reduction strategies.

=== Stockpile destruction ===

Stockpiled [[anti-personnel mine|anti-personnel landmines]] (APM) far outnumber those actually laid in the ground. In accordance with Article 4 of the [[Ottawa Treaty|anti-personnel mine-ban treaty]], State Parties must destroy their stockpiled mines within four years after their accession to the convention. Sixty-five countries have now destroyed their stockpiles of antipersonnel landmines, destroying a combined total of more than 37 million mines. Another 51 countries have officially declared not having a stockpile of antipersonnel mines and a further  three countries are scheduled to destroy their stockpiles by the end of the year.

There are many options available to states in destroying their stockpiles. Stockpiles are usually destroyed by the military, but an industrial solution can also be employed. The techniques used vary depending on the make-up of the mines and the conditions in which they are found. The complete destruction cycle involves aspects such as transportation and storage, processing operations, equipment maintenance, staff training and accounting, as well as the actual physical destruction.

==== Pre-process technology ====

It is may be necessary to disassemble or breakdown anti-personnel mines prior to the destruction process. This is necessary because of limitations on the amount of contained explosive that can be incinerated, the [[anti-personnel mine]] design or the requirement for different components to have separate destruction methods. All of these methods require the movement of exposed bare explosive to the final destruction facility. Available technology includes: manual disassembly, mechanical disassembly (pull apart, defuzing and depriming), robotic disassembly, mechanical breakdown (bandsaw, guillotine, cracker mill, rock crusher, punch), cryofracture, hydro abrasive cutting, laser cutting, and microwave explosive melt-out. The following are brief descriptions of these techniques:

=====Manual disassembly=====

This technique implies the use of human resources to physically dismantle APM by manual labour using simple hand tools. It has the advantage of requiring limited capital investment required, but is a labour-intensive process which results in relatively slow production rates. This method requires well-trained, yet semi-skilled staff.

=====Mechanical disassembly=====

The use of mechanically operated systems to dismantle APM. The different technologies are available, as noted above are: Pull Apart, Defuzing and Depriming. In contrast to manual disassembly, mechanical disassembly has the advantages of high production rates, it is an efficient system of work and has low staff requirements. It is environmentally friendly for this stage of the demilitarisation cycle and the technology is readily available. A major disadvantage, however, is the requirement for high capital investment. This is further complicated by the need for a wide range of equipment necessary to cope with all pre-processing requirements.

=====Robotic disassembly=====

A fully automated disassembly system. Similar advantages and disadvantages to mechanical disassembly, however the initial capital costs are much greater. This system would only be economically efficient for very large production runs due to the high start-up costs.

=====Mechanical breakdown=====

This process is mainly concerned with techniques required to expose the explosive fillings of APMs prior to the destruction phase. There are low staff requirements for mechanical breakdown, and it is an environmentally friendly operation during this stage of the demilitarisation cycle. The technology is now readily available and there is no secondary waste stream, which reduces scrap salvage and disposal costs. A major disadvantage is the requirement for high capital investment. This is further complicated by the need for a wide range of equipment necessary to cope with all pre-processing requirements. Production rates per machine can be slow and there is always the danger of induced initiation of the target APM during processing.

=====Cryofracture=====

This process is used to break down an APM into small enough pieces to be processed through an incineration destruction method. It involves the use of liquid nitrogen to change the mechanical properties of the munition casing to a more brittle phase by cooling it to -130 C. The munition can then be easily shattered using simple mechanical shear or press techniques. A cryogenic wash out system is in the early stages of development. The principle is similar to cryogenic fracture; except that the filling is attacked with liquid nitrogen in order to make its removal easier.

Cryofracture is an environmentally friendly technique during this stage of the demilitarisation cycle with low staff requirements. The technique can also be used for any other type of munition, explosive or propellant with limited pre-preparation of the munition required. There is no secondary waste stream, hence cutting final disposal costs. In financial terms low capital investment only is required for set up costs. Sensitivity tests have shown that even at -196C there is little change to the insensitiveness of the munition.

The disadvantage of high operating costs for liquid nitrogen usage must also be considered, however. Today there is only one proven production system in place. APMs with metal or aluminium casings are not susceptible to embrittlement and variations in the shear forces or pressures are required to fracture the munition casing. Further trials are necessary, as analysis has shown that the failure modes for the munition casings involved a mixture of brittle fracture, plastic deformation and shearing. Results are currently unpredictable and there is an obvious low temperature hazard to personnel.

======Hydro abrasive cutting (HAC)======

The use of water and abrasives at pressures from 240 to 1000 BAR to cut open APM bodies by an erosive process. There are two distinct technologies; 1) "entrainment" or 2) "direct injection". Research has now proven that the direct injection technology should be the preferred option for safety reasons. There are low staff requirements for HAC systems and a wide range of target munitions can be attacked. The explosive safety of systems is well proven and it is a cost effective technique in comparison to other pre-processing methods.The major disadvantage is the requirement for initial high capital investment for infrastructure. The systems also produce contaminated waste-water, which requires a complex filtration system to clean it up. In terms of post-process operations, the explosive content is "grit sensitised" and requires careful handling during any further processing or destruction.

=====Laser cutting=====

Still in the research phase in the USA.

=====Microwave melt-out=====

This technology is also under development in the USA. It utilises microwaves to heat up TNT based explosive fillings. It is a rapid, clean technique but has one major disadvantage, the lack of control over heating can lead to the formation of "hot spots" with a resultant initiation of the filling. Work continues on its development, but it is not yet a feasible production technique. It is more energy efficient that steam and improves the value of any recovered explosives.

==== Destruction technology ====

There are a wide range of industrial technologies available for the final destruction of anti-personnel mines. The selection of the most suitable principle depends primarily on the pre-processing techniques to be utilised, and vice versa. The system must be designed to result in efficient production rates.

=====Open-pit incineration=====
Waste material is placed on a tiled floor in a purpose built pit equipped with perforated air pipes to supply forced air to the system. A turbulent air current is created above the fire that re-circulates the combustion gases and particulates, which assists in full oxidation of the evolving gases. The principle has been tested, but no large scale trials have yet been conducted.

=====Rotary kiln incineration=====

This is perhaps the most common, and certainly most mature demilitarisation destruction technology available. The rotary kiln is an unlined rotary furnace originally designed to destroy small arms and bulk explosives. The kiln is made up of four 1.6 metre long, 1 metre outer diameter retort sections bolted together. The 6 to 8&amp;nbsp;cm thick walls of the kiln are designed to withstand small detonations. The kiln contains internal spiral flights, which move the waste in an auger-like fashion through the retort as the kiln rotates. The flights also provide charge separation for the in-process materials, and discourage [[sympathetic detonation]]s and scattering of materials. The kiln is equipped with a variable speed drive, which allows varying rotation speeds and material residence time.

=====Car bottom furnace=====

Car bottom [[furnace]]s are used to destroy small amounts of explosive or explosive residue left after flush-out pre-processing techniques.

=====Directly heated retort=====

A thin walled and ceramic lined [[furnace]] in which the feed system uses an auger. Pre-processed by a crusher. Used to process general chemical waste and explosive in solution. A typical production rate of 10,000 tonnes per year.

=====Plasma arc=====

A plasma torch, at temperatures in the region of 4000C to 7000C, is used to heat a container into which waste products are fed. The plasma is an ionised gas at extremely high temperature, which is used to initiate rapid chemical decomposition by the action of this extreme heat. The material is currently fed in a slurry form, although research is ongoing for the destruction of entire munitions. It is a complex production system that has a high power requirement.

=====Mechanical destruction=====

The use of high strength and capacity commercial crushing or shredding machines. Only suitable for APMs with a very low net explosive content.

====="Silver II"=====
An electro-chemical oxidation process. The organic waste is treated by the generation of highly oxidising species in an electro-chemical cell. The cell is separated into two compartments by a membrane that allows ion flow but prevents bulk mixing of the anolyte and catholyte. In the anolyte compartment a highly reactive species of silver ion attacks organic material ultimately converting it to CO2, H2O and non-toxic inorganic compounds.

=====Biological degradation=====

This technology has been demonstrated at the pilot level for the destruction of perchlorate contaminated aqueous streams. The potential exists for bacteria to be used to consume the explosive content of APM, converting it into inert material. It requires extensive storage capacity whilst bio-remediation is taking place and only has limited applications. There is also a requirement for an element of mechanical breakdown prior to the addition of the bacteria.

=====Contained detonation=====

The destruction of ammunition and explosives by detonation in an enclosed chamber. The evolving gases are then processed by an integral pollution control system. Limited pre-processing is required and a wide variety of ammunition natures can be destroyed. However, the available systems are currently limited to 15&amp;nbsp;kg Net Explosive Content. There is also a requirement for a donor charge for each detonation, therefore the process is expensive in serviceable ammunition usage.

=====Molten salt oxidation=====

Only demonstrated at prototype scale. Can destroy finely divided and consistent organic waste, therefore significant pre-processing required. These wastes can be destroyed by incineration anyway. A purely technical solution, but too expensive and impracticable at the moment.

==== Scrap processing technology ====

The final disposal of arisings from any of the above systems will require some form of scrap processing facility. Commercial advice is required in this area to determine the production rates, technical capability and availability of systems.

Industrial scrap processing systems work by crushing, shredding, cracking or compressing the feed material into an easily manageable form for further salvage or recycling processes. There may be a requirement for a combination of techniques for scrap that is difficult to process.

=== Mine victim assistance ===

Mine victim assistance is a humanitarian effort which aims to organize a collaborative support for injured victims from mine and ERW as well as their families, thus enabling them to live normal lives. The approaches include physical rehabilitation, psychological support, and recovery of the victimized family and community. The work involves different level of actors, various organizations and State Parties who are obliged to perform the task under the Article 6 of the [[Mine Ban Treaty]] and Article 5 of the [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]]. [[United Nations Mine Action Service]] (UNMAS) is another active participant cooperating with other actors under United Nations, recently presenting the 6-year plan according to mine action, "The Strategy of the United Nations on Mine Action 2013-2018".&lt;ref name="UN Mine Action Gateway"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Mine Action Gateway : Victim Assistance|url=http://www.mineaction.org/issues/victimassistance|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tiny community of '''Nepalis in South Africa''' consisting mainly of immigrants and expatriates from [[Nepal]].

==Overview==
Migration from Nepal to South Africa began in the 1980s'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepaleseabroad.com/south-africa/811/ NepalesAbroad.com: NRNA – South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there are about 150 Nepalis living in different cities of South Africa. Of them, 27 families belong to the medical profession. It is expected that the flow of Nepalis in South Africa will continue after the opening of the Embassy of Nepal in [[Pretoria]].

===Organizations===
In 2008, about 70 Non-Resident Nepalis from different parts of the country had gathered in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]] to form the [[Non Resident Nepali Association|NRNA-NCC]] of South Africa.

'''Noy''', or '''Loo''', is a [[Language death|nearly extinct]] [[language]] of [[Chad]].  In 1993 it had a population of 36 speakers, who lived in the Moyen-Chari and Mandoul regions, between Sarh, Djoli, Bédaya, Koumra, and Koumogo villages.  Speakers are shifting to [[Sar language|Sar]], the [[lingua franca]] of regional capital [[Sarh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = Endangered Languages in Central Africa | pages = 163–178 | first = Bruce | last = Connell | year = 2008 | title = ''Language Diversity Endangered'' | editor-first = Matthias | editor-last = Brenzinger | publisher = Mouton de Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Opposition to the [[Mauna Kea Observatories]]''' has existed since the first telescope was built in the late 1960s. Originally part of research begun by [[Gerard Kuiper]] of the [[University of Arizona]], the site has expanded into the world's largest observatory for infrared and submillimeter telescopes. Opposition to the telescope from residents in the city of [[Hilo, Hawaii]] were concerned about the visual appearance of the mountain and [[Native Hawaiians]] voiced concerns over the site being sacred to the [[Hawaiian religion]] as the home of several deities. Environmental groups and activists have been expressing concern over endangered species habitat.

The [[Outrigger Telescopes Project]], intended to build from four to six comparatively small telescopes for interferometry, was to surround the Keck telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keckobservatory.org/record_of_decision_issued_for_outrigger_telescope_project/|title= Record of Decision for the Outrigger Telescope Project|website=W. M.

An ongoing proposal for one of the world's largest optical telescopes, the [[Thirty Meter Telescope]] (TMT) was the focus of protests concerning the continued development of the mountain Hawaiians consider the most sacred peak in the island chain.  On October 30, 2018, the [[Supreme Court of Hawaii]] approved the resumption of construction of the TMT.&lt;ref name="bbc201810313"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46046864 Hawaii top court approves controversial Thirty Meter Telescope] BBC News, 2018-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2018/10/30/state-supreme-court-rules-favor-thirty-meter-telescopes-construction/|title=State Supreme Court rules in favor of Thirty Meter Telescope’s construction|accessdate = 2018-10-31|agency=Hawaii News Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After studying photos for NASA's [[Apollo program]] that contained greater detail than any ground-based telescope, Gerard Kuiper began seeking an arid site for infrared studies.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Inc.1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.|title=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gcAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35|date=November 1964|publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.|page=35|issn=0096-3402}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he first began looking in Chile, he also made the decision to perform tests in the Hawaiian Islands. Tests on [[Maui]]'s [[Haleakalā]] were promising but the mountain was too low in the inversion layer and often covered by clouds. On the "Big Island" of Hawaii, Mauna Kea is considered the highest island mountain in the world. While the summit is often covered with snow the air itself is extremely dry.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt; Kuiper began looking into the possibility of an observatory on Mauna Kea. After testing, he discovered the low humidity was perfect for infrared signals. He persuaded then Governor, [[John A. Burns]] to bulldoze a dirt road to the summit where he built a small telescope on Pu{{okina}}u Poli{{okina}}ahu, a cinder cone peak.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yount1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Yount|title=Who Runs the University?: The Politics of Higher Education in Hawaii, 1985-1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtnBE9CcxOAC&amp;pg=PA232|date=1 January 1996|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1821-0|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Astronomy Now|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CB7yAAAAMAAJ|year=1991|publisher=Intra Press|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peak was the second highest on the mountain with the highest peak being holy ground, so Kuiper avoided it.&lt;ref name="PARKER2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry R. PARKER|title=Stairway to the Stars: The Story of the World’s Largest Observatory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbkACAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|date=11 November 2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4899-6052-8|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, Kuiper tried enlisting NASA to fund a larger facility with a large telescope, housing and other needed structures. NASA, in turn decided to make the project open to competition. Professor of physics, John Jefferies of the [[University of Hawaii]] placed a bid on behalf of the university.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leverington2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Leverington|title=A History of Astronomy: from 1890 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r47qBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA276|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4471-2124-4|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KaminsPotter1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert M.

The proposal was for a two-meter telescope to serve both the needs of NASA and the university. While large telescopes are not ordinarily awarded to universities without well established astronomers, Jefferies and UH were awarded the NASA contract, infuriating Kuiper who felt that "his mountain" had been "stolen" from "him".&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tatarewicz1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph N. Tatarewicz|title=Space Technology &amp; Planetary Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MnXQtlBcRFIC&amp;pg=PA82|year=1990|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-35655-5|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuiper would abandon his site (the very first telecope on Mauna Kea) over the competition and begin work in Arizona on a different NASA project. After considerable testing by Jefferies' team, the best locations were determined to be near the summit at the top of the cinder cones. Testing also determined Mauna Kea to be superb for nighttime viewing due to many factors including the thin air, constant trade winds and being surrounded by sea. Jefferies would build a 2.24 meter telescope with the State of Hawaii agreeing to build a reliable, all weather roadway to the summit. Building began in 1967 and first light seen in 1970.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. B.

==Expansion renews opposition==
In Honolulu, the governor and legislature, enthusiastic about the development, set aside an even larger area for the observatory causing opposition in the main city of the Big Island, [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]]. Native [[kānaka ʻōiwi]] believed the entire site was sacred and that developing the mountain, even for science, would spoil the area. Environmentalists were concerned about rare native bird populations and other citizens of Hilo were concerned about the sight of the domes from the city. Using town hall meetings, Jefferies was able to overcome opposition by weighing the economic advantage and prestige the island would receive.&lt;ref name="Zirker2005" /&gt; There has been substantial opposition to the Mauna Kea observatories that continues to grow.&lt;ref name="Oswalt2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry D. Oswalt|title=The Future of Small Telescopes in the New Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZqLBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|year=2003|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-010-0253-0|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the opposition to the observatories may have become the most visible example of the conflict western science has encountered over access and use of environmental and culturally significant sites.&lt;ref name="DearKetchum2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Dear|author2=Jim Ketchum|author3=Sarah Luria|author4=Doug Richardson|title=GeoHumanities: Art, History, Text at the Edge of Place|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zwrJBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT476|date=13 April 2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-88347-7|page=476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to development grew shortly after expansion of the observatories commenced. Once access was opened up by the roadway to the summit, skiers began using it for recreation and objected when the road was closed as a precaution against vandalism when the telescopes were being built. Hunters voiced concerns, as did the Hawaiian [[Audubon Society]], which was supported by Governor [[George Ariyoshi]].&lt;ref name="PARKER2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry R. PARKER|title=Stairway to the Stars: The Story of the World’s Largest Observatory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbkACAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56|date=11 November 2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4899-6052-8|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Audubon Society objected to further development on Mauna Kea over concerns to habitat of the endangered [[palila]], an [[endemic]] species to only specific parts of this mountain. The bird is the last of the finch billed honeycreepers existing on the island. Over 50% of native bird species had been killed off due to loss of habitat from early western settlers, or the introduction of non-native species competing for resources. Hunters and sportsmen were concerned that the hunting of feral animals would be effected by the telescope operations.&lt;ref name="Gordon2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Gordon|title=Recollections of "Tucson Operations": The Millimeter-Wave Observatory of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWPbIrwEKpMC&amp;pg=PA136|date=18 July 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-3236-3|pages=136–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Save Mauna Kea" movement was inspired by the proliferation of telescopes, with opposition believing development of the mountain to be sacrilegious.&lt;ref name="Oaks2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert F. Oaks|title=Hawaii:: A History of the Big Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HDVNJ5wzcisC&amp;pg=PA131|date=1 November 2003|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-1-4396-1403-7|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Hawaiian non-profit groups, such as Kahea, (whose goals are the protection of cultural heritage and the environment), oppose development on Mauna Kea as a sacred space to the Hawaiian religion.&lt;ref name="Kaufman2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ned Kaufman|title=Place, Race, and Story: Essays on the Past and Future of Historic Preservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5fCTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14|date=11 September 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-88972-2|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Mauna Kea hosts the world's largest location for telescope observations in infrared and submillimeter astronomy. The land itself is protected by the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966|U.S. Historical Preservation Act]] due to its significance to Hawaiian culture, but this still allowed development.&lt;ref name="Schachter2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith Schachter|title=The Legacies of a Hawaiian Generation: From Territorial Subject to American Citizen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OTTUAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|date=15 September 2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-78238-012-2|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outrigger telescopes==

Development of the Mauna Kea observatories is still opposed by environmental groups and Native Hawaiians. A 2006 proposal for the [[Navy Precision Optical Interferometer|Outrigger Telescopes]] to become extensions of the [[Keck Observatory]] was canceled after a judge's determination that a full environmental impact statement must be prepared before any further development of the site.&lt;ref name="Campbell2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeff Campbell|title=Hawaii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRXR69wo-rYC&amp;pg=PA97|date=15 September 2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74220-344-7|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "outrigger" would have linked the [[Keck I]] and [[Keck II]] telescopes. Environmental groups and Native Hawaiian activists were much stronger in their opposition this time than they had been in the past, but NASA went ahead with the proposal for lack of an alternate site. The group ''Mauna Kea Anaina Hou'' made several arguments against the development, including that Mauna Kea was a sacred mountain to Native Hawaiians where many deities live, and that the cinder cone location being proposed was holy in Hawaiian tradition as a burial site for a demi-god. The group raised several other concerns, such as environmental, concern for the preservation of native insects, the question of [[Ceded lands]], and an audit report critical of the mountain's management.&lt;ref name="Takahashi2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Kenji Takahashi|title=Simple Solutions for Humanity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNBF9eqXUzYC&amp;pg=PA164|date=29 February 2008|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4678-3517-6|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thirty Meter Telescope proposal==
{{Main|Thirty Meter Telescope protests}}
[[File:Kealoha Pisciotta.JPG|left|thumb|Kealoha Pisciotta, a former Mauna Kea Observatory employee, testifies at a State hearing in 2011.]]
The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) is a controversial proposal for an extremely large, segmented, mirror telescope, planned for the summit of Mauna Kea. It is now the focal point of further development of the observatory site, and a legal battle was fought through the Hawaii court system. The [[Supreme Court of Hawaii]] approved the resumption of construction of the telescope on 31 October 2018.&lt;ref name="bbc201810313" /&gt;

The TMT project is a response to a recommendation in 2000 from the [[US National Academy of Sciences]] that a thirty-meter telescope be the top priority and be built within the decade.&lt;ref name="LobanovZensus2007"&gt;{{cite book |author1=A.P.

Among other criteria, the development may not "cause substantial adverse impact to existing natural resources within the surrounding area, community, or region,” and the "existing physical and environmental aspects of the land must be preserved or improved upon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.hi.us/dlnr/swat/Land/Ch13-5.pdf |title=Conservation District |publisher=State.hi.us |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native Hawaiian activists such as Kealoha Pisciotta, a former employee of the [[Mauna Kea Observatories]], have raised concerns over the telescopes on Mauna Kea desecrating what some Native Hawaiians consider to be their most sacred mountain.&lt;ref name="LaDuke2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Winona LaDuke]]|title=Recovering the Sacred: The Power of Naming and Claiming|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8je1uCLLRvgC&amp;pg=PA30|year=2005|publisher=South End Press|isbn=978-0-89608-712-5|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pisciotta, a former telescope systems specialist technician at [[James Clark Maxwell telescope]], is one of several people suing to stop the construction,&lt;ref name=Worth&gt;{{cite news|last1=Worth|first1=Katie|title=World’s Largest Telescope Faces Opposition from Native Hawaiian Protesters|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/world-s-largest-telescope-faces-opposition-from-native-hawaiian-protesters/|accessdate=22 April 2015|agency=Scientific American|publisher=Scientific American, a Division of Nature America, Inc.|date=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also director of Mauna Kea Anaina Hou.&lt;ref name="Huliau"&gt;{{cite book|title=Huliau: Time of Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_torGEMuDyYC|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Kuleana 'Oiwi Press|isbn=978-0-9668220-3-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April, 2015, two separate appeals were still pending.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Molly|title=Construction Of Giant Telescope In Hawaii Draws Natives' Ire|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/04/21/400390724/construction-of-giant-telescope-in-hawaii-draws-natives-ire|agency=National Public Radio|publisher=NPR|date=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1998 study ''Mauna Kea Science Reserve and Hale Pohaku Complex Development Plan Update'' stated that "...nearly all the interviewees and all others who participated in the consultation process (Appendices B and C) called for a moratorium on any further development on the summit of Mauna Kea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.envirowatch.org/MKoverview.htm |title=overview of info |work= Mauna Kea Science Reserve and Hale Pohaku Complex Development Plan Update:|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources|Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources]] conditionally approved the Mauna Kea site for the TMT in February 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4125">'''Paul Gordon Hiebert''' (13 November 1932 – 11 March 2007) was an American [[missiologist]]. He was "arguably the world's leading missiological anthropologist."&lt;ref name=Priest&gt;{{cite news|last1=Priest|first1=Robert J.|title=Paul Hiebert: A Life Remembered|url=http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/2007/sepoct/9.9.html?paging=off|accessdate=7 February 2015|work=Books and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiebert was born in India to missionary parents, and studied at [[Tabor College (Kansas)|Tabor College]], [[Mennonite Brethren Biblical Seminary]], and the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=Priest /&gt; Subsequently Hiebert went on an overseas mission to [[India]] and was Principal of the [[Mennonite Brethren Centenary Bible College]], [[Shamshabad]].  After a period of missionary service, he proceeded to [[Pasadena, California]] where he taught at [[Fuller Theological Seminary]] before becoming Distinguished Professor of Mission and Anthropology at [[Trinity Evangelical Divinity School]].

Hiebert was best known for his concept of the "excluded middle". He argued that most [[Western world|Westerners]] see the universe as consisting of two tiers - the invisible things of the other world, and the visible things of this world. In this way, they exclude the part in between - namely, the invisible things of this world, and in particular the unseen personal beings, such as angels and demons. Hiebert suggested that non-Westerners are much more likely to accept this "excluded middle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hiebert|first1=Paul G.|title=The Flaw of the Excluded Middle|url=http://www.michaelsheiser.com/UFOReligions/FlawofExcludedMiddle.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207083930/http://www.michaelsheiser.com/UFOReligions/FlawofExcludedMiddle.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 February 2015|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Croucher|first1=Rowland|author-link=Rowland Croucher|title=Flaw of the Excluded Middle|url=http://www.jmm.org.au/articles/14692.htm|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=Pierre|title=Further Reflections on Paul Hiebert's "The Flaw of the Excluded Middle"|journal=Direction|date=Fall 2007|volume=36|issue=2|pages=206–218|url=http://www.directionjournal.org/issues/gen/art_1487_.html|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Festschrift]]'' in his honor, ''Globalizing Theology: Belief and Practice in an Era of World Christianity'', was published in 2006. Hiebert died of cancer in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wan|first1=Enoch|title=Legacy of Paul G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4600">The '''Poppleton manuscript''' is the name given to the fourteenth century [[codex]] likely compiled by Robert of [[Upper Poppleton|Poppleton]], a [[Carmelite]] friar who was the Prior of [[Hulne Priory|Hulne]], near [[Alnwick]]. The manuscript contains numerous works, such as a [[World map|map of the world]] (with index), and works by [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] and [[Gerald of Wales]]. It is now in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], [[Paris, France|Paris]] (Ms Latin 4126).

The manuscript is famous because it contains seven consecutive documents concerning medieval [[Scotland]], some of which are unique to the manuscript, and regarded as important sources. The first six, at least, had probably been compiled previously in Scotland, in the early thirteenth century. They comprise:

# ''[[de Situ Albanie]]''; which appears to be an introduction to the following five or six texts. The Poppleton MS preserves the only copy of this.
# ''[[Cronica de origine antiquorum Pictorum]]'' (i.e. ''Chronicle on the Origins of the Ancient Picts''); part of the [[Pictish Chronicle]], this is largely a [[pastiche]] of wider Latin learning regarding the [[Picts]] and [[Scoti|Scots]]. It contains extracts from the ''Etymologiae'' of [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Nennius]]'s ''Historia Brittonum''.
# A [[List of Kings of the Picts|Pictish King List]]; part of the Pictish Chroncle, this is a largely un-Gaelicized list of Pictish Kings, containing an opening mythological section not present in many other Pictish king lists. Unlike related Pictish king-lists, it gets cut off at the accession of [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Cináed mac Ailpín]]. It reveals its origins at [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]] by preserving a spurious foundation "charter" for the monastery there, reputedly granted by King [[Nechtan II of the Picts|Nechtan]] (fl. early seventh century), whom it calls ''Nectonius magnus filius Uuirp''.
# ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]''; it is a short chronicle of the [[Kings of Scots|Kings]] of [[Alba]], from the period of King [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Cináed mac Ailpín]] (d. 858) until the reign of King [[Kenneth III of Scotland|Cináed mac Maíl Coluim]] (r. d. 995). As for the ''de Situ Albanie'', the Poppleton MS preserves the only copy.
# A List of [[Dál Riata]]n and [[Kings of Scots|Scottish monarchs]]; this joined pair of king-lists starts from the legendary [[Fergus Mór mac Eirc]], and ends with [[William I of Scotland|William I]].
# A [[genealogy]] of William I; this genealogy goes all the way back to Adam, via [[Gaidhel Glas]]. It is just a record or partial translation of a Gaelic genealogy, in which ''mac'' and ''meic'' have been replaced with ''filius'' and ''filii''. Virtually all ancestors before [[David I of Scotland|David I]] have their names in the [[Middle Irish language|Middle Irish]] [[genitive case|genitive form]].
# A foundation legend of [[St Andrews]]; it may not have been compiled by the author of ''de Situ Albanie'' in the thirteenth century, simply because it does not fit in with the logic presented by documents one to six, and is unrelated to the legend or topic is mentioned in ''de Situ Albanie''.

The value of the manuscript has been shown in the publications of [[William Forbes Skene]], Alan Orr Anderson, and his wife Marjory Anderson. Dozens of articles have been written in the last half-century about various aspects of the Scottish content, although studies of the whole manuscript have been rarer.

The '''Republican Generation''' is an identified generational cohort within the [[Strauss Howe generational theory]], born between 1742 and 1766.

This generation is known for participating in several global revolutionary movements during the [[Age of Revolution]]. 

This generation witnessed political turmoil in response to growing [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and the vast [[Social inequality|social inequalities]] exacerbated by ruthless competition between European Monarchists.

They came of age during British imperialism and during a time when the viability of [[mercantilism]] was being questioned.

Relying on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment philosophy]], they unleashed violent episodes of revolution, vilified Monarchy, and promoted [[Republicanism]].

In [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial America]], they participated in the [[American Revolutionary War]], secured Independence from British rule, and established a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] system of governance, based on [[Federal republic|constitutional republicanism]] and [[representative democracy]].

==Notable Persons==

Notable persons affiliated with this generation include [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], [[Maximilien Robespierre]], and [[Camille Desmoulins]].

'''Ronald Weitzer''' (born 1952)&lt;ref&gt;''Sex for Sale: Prostitution, Pornography, and the Sex Industry'', edited by Ronald Weitzer, Routledge, 2000. {{ISBN|0-415-92294-1}} (hc), {{ISBN|0-415-92295-X}} (pb).&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[sociologist]] specializing in [[criminology]] and a professor at [[George Washington University]], known for his publications on [[police]]-[[minority group|minority]] relations and on the [[sex industry]].&lt;ref name=gwu1/&gt;

==Research and views==

===Prostitution and sex trafficking===
Weitzer has authored a number of papers on the [[sex industry]], with a focus on laws and policies regarding [[prostitution]] and [[sex trafficking]].&lt;ref name=gwu1/&gt; He published a 1999 article evaluating US policies as well as a 2009 study of [[Prostitution in Australia#Western Australia|prostitution in Western Australia]], whose state legislature voted to legalize brothel and escort prostitution in 2008.

In 2012 he published a book on legal prostitution systems, ''Legalizing Prostitution: From Illicit Vice to Lawful Business''. The book is based on Weitzer's review of studies of legal prostitution in various nations (New Zealand, Australia, Mexico, and the US state of Nevada) as well as his own research on Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. Weitzer notes that the notion of "legal prostitution" is not monolithic: it varies considerably from place to place. First, nations differ in the kinds of prostitution that they permit. Some allow brothels only, others restrict it to escort services, while others allow only independent operators (i.e., those who self-employed and have no connections to a third-party manager or business establishment). A few societies, such as New Zealand, permit all types of consensual adult prostitution, but most continue to criminalize street prostitution because it is considered more risky and more of a public nuisance than indoor prostitution. In addition, in places where the trade has been decriminalized, at least some types of participants remain illegal. For example, minors are not allowed to work legally, exploitative pimping and trafficking are outlawed, and some societies prohibit migrants or persons infected with HIV from working legally. So, even where prostitution has been decriminalized and is now government-regulated, some types of participants are excluded from the legal regime.

Second, nations differ in the kinds of regulations imposed on legal actors. Some restrict it to designated parts of the city, while others allow it to be more dispersed. Some mandate regular health examinations to check for [[Sexually transmitted infections|STD]]s. Some require condom use, while others simply encourage it. Some require sex workers to be registered with the authorities, although this is widely opposed by the workers, who fear that this information may become publicly available. Most require business owners (of brothels, escort agencies, saunas) to be licensed, and the authorities conduct periodic site visits to ensure that the regulations are being followed. Where such licensing exists, officials often screen applicants to make sure that they have no criminal record nor connections to organized crime.

''Legalizing Prostitution'' examines a wide variety of regulations that differ from nation to nation. One of Weitzer's objectives is to assess which kinds of regulations are (1) most sensible, (2) most likely to win public support, (3) best suited to reducing risks and harms, and (4) most likely to preserve public order. There is much room for debate here, and each nation that has legalized prostitution has had to grapple with these difficult questions. Weitzer's book advocates about 30 "best practices" that he thinks should be taken into account by any nation considering legalization. The first step, he writes, is that "consensual adult prostitution be officially recognized as work and that participants be accorded the rights and protections available to those involved in other occupations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weitzer|first1=Ronald|title=Legalizing Prostitution: From Illicit Vice to Lawful Business|date=2012|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814794647}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|207}}

The book also evaluates existing legal systems. While no system is problem-free, Weitzer finds that several have registered a good measure of success. New Zealand scores well, as does Queensland, Australia, where a 2004 government assessment concluded that its legal brothels "provide a sustainable model for a healthy, crime-free, and safe legal licensed brothel industry" and are a "state of the art model for the sex industry in Australia." While positive outcomes are by no means automatic or guaranteed, Weitzer finds that legal, well-regulated prostitution can be superior to blanket criminalization.

Blanket decriminalization and government regulation of prostitution is not currently possible in the United States. Given this, Weitzer advocates what he calls a "two-track" policy toward enforcement of prostitution laws. One track involves intensified law enforcement of [[street prostitution]] (targeting both street prostitutes and their customers), arguing that street prostitution victimizes host communities and leaves the prostitutes themselves open to victimization. The second track involves what he calls "de facto decriminalization" of indoor prostitution, that is, the non-enforcement by police departments of laws against various forms of indoor prostitution, such as [[call girl|escort services]], [[massage parlors]], and [[brothels]], even while such laws stay on the books. Weitzer holds that these kinds of activities typically have little effect on the surrounding community and that enforcing laws against such practices involves time-consuming [[sting operations]] that waste police resources. Weitzer argues that this two track approach reflects public preferences regarding the proper focus of law enforcement, is a more efficient use of law enforcement resources, and is guided by the principle of [[harm reduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Weitzer | first = Ronald | title = Prostitution control in America: rethinking public policy | journal = Crime, Law and Social Change | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–102 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1023/A:1008305200324 | date = September 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008305200324 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Weitzer | first = Ronald | title = Why prostitution initiative misses / Measure Q in Berkeley fails on 3 counts | url = http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Why-prostitution-initiative-misses-Measure-Q-in-2691330.php | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | publisher = [[Hearst Corporation]] | date = September 26, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indoor prostitution is quite different from street prostitution. Weitzer views street prostitution as a serious social problem. Many streetwalkers are underage or runaways or homeless or economically distressed—selling sex out of desperation and for reasons of survival. They are at high risk of drug abuse and victimization and street prostitution has a negative impact on surrounding communities. The push factors that lead individuals into street prostitution (such as poverty, drug addiction, or being runaways from abusive parents) will not be alleviated if street prostitution is decriminalized. At the same time, it is clear that arrests, fines, and incarceration do little to address the root causes of street prostitution. Weitzer advocates far more local government resources be devoted to helping streetwalkers leave prostitution and to facilitating their reintegration into society—requiring a holistic program of temporary housing, drug treatment, health care, counseling, job training, and other needed services.

Weitzer has been highly critical of the prohibitionist position on prostitution (which seeks to eradicate it entirely) and the conflation of all [[sex work]] with sex trafficking. While agreeing that sex trafficking is a real and serious problem, he argues that the scale of it has been greatly exaggerated by ideological organizations such as the [[Coalition Against Trafficking in Women]]. He also argues against claims that prostitution universally involves coercion and violence and that [[legalization]] would make such problems worse, claiming that research has shown that carefully regulated legal prostitution, in parts of the world where it exists, greatly increases the safety and [[job satisfaction]] of sex workers. He also argues against what he views as the [[demonization]] of customers in anti-prostitution arguments. He has stated that the exaggeration of the scale of violence and trafficking in the sex industry, the demonization of customers, and the call for a punitive response to such problems by prostitution abolitionists amounts to a [[moral panic]].&lt;ref name=criminologist&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Weitzer | first = Ronald | title = The growing moral panic over prostitution and sex trafficking | journal = The Criminologist | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 1, 3–5 | publisher = [[American Society of Criminology]] | date = September–October 2005 | url = http://www.asc41.com/Criminologist/2005/September-October%202005.htm | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.bayswan.org/traffick/Weitzer_Criminologist.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amsexuality&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Weitzer | first = Ronald | title = Prostitution panic: the growing hysteria over sex trafficking | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516092458/http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/MagArticle.cfm?Article=566 | archive-date = 16 May 2008 | url = http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/MagArticle.cfm?Article=566 | work = American Sexuality (online journal) | publisher = National Sexuality Resource Center, [[San Francisco State University]] | date = February 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weitzer2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Weitzer | first = Ronald | title = The social construction of sex trafficking: ideology and institutionalization of a moral crusade | journal = [[Politics &amp; Society]] | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 447–475 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0032329207304319 | date = September 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0032329207304319 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/The%20social%20construction%20of%20sex%20trafficking%20Weitzer%20Pol%20Soc%202007%20%2035(3)%20%20447-475.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628043556/http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/The%20social%20construction%20of%20sex%20trafficking%20Weitzer%20Pol%20Soc%202007%20%2035%283%29%20%20447-475.pdf |date=2011-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He further argues that prostitution abolitionists are largely motivated by ideology, generally [[radical feminism]] or [[Christian right]] views, and this ideologically driven view taints research and statistics about prostitution and trafficking offered by researchers and groups that advocate this position.&lt;ref name=criminologist/&gt;&lt;ref name=amsexuality/&gt;&lt;ref name=weitzer2007/&gt; He has been particularly critical of the claims of anti-prostitution writers such as [[Janice Raymond]], [[Donna M. Hughes]], and [[Melissa Farley]] for such reasons.&lt;ref name=weitzervaw1&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weitzer | first = Ronald | title = Flawed theory and method in studies of prostitution | journal = [[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 934–949 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077801205276986 | date = July 2005 | doi = 10.1177/1077801205276986 | pmid = 16043578 | ref = harv | postscript = . | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060111065947/http://www.woodhullfoundation.org/content/otherpublications/WeitzerVAW-1.pdf | archivedate = January 11, 2006 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weitzer points out that the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] and its [[United States Congress|congressional]] allies strongly embraced prostitution abolitionist views as a justification for a much broader crackdown on the sex industry.&lt;ref name=criminologist/&gt;&lt;ref name=amsexuality/&gt;&lt;ref name=weitzer2007/&gt;

Weitzer analyzes these and other issues in a journal article that critically evaluates many of the popular claims about human trafficking. Such claims are often devoid of verifiable data but typically get treated as factual by the mass media, politicians, pundits, and activists—and government policies and expenditures regarding trafficking are often based on these highly dubious claims. As an alternative, Weitzer advocates that policies and legislation be based strictly on solid evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weitzer | first = Ronald | title = Sex trafficking and the sex industry: the need for evidence-based theory and legislation | journal = [[Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology]] | volume = 101 | issue = 4 | pages = 1337–1370 | publisher = [[Northwestern University School of Law]] | date = Fall 2011

===Police-minority relations===
Weitzer has done research on [[police]]-[[minority group|minority]] relations in Israel, [[Northern Ireland]], [[South Africa]], and the [[United States]],&lt;ref name=gwu1/&gt; including studies of [[racial profiling]] and police misconduct and racially biased policing.&lt;ref&gt;"Perceptions of Racial Profiling: Race, Class, and Personal Experience" by Ronald Weitzer and Steven Tuch, ''Criminology'' 40(2):435–456, May 2002. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1745-9125.2002.tb00962.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~bygeorge/051503/profiling.html " GW Study Explores Profiling Response: Professors Weitzer and Tuch Find Racial Profiling Viewed as Widespread Across America"] by Eric Solomon, ''ByGeorge! Online'', George Washington University, May 15, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; His research has used multiple research methods including quantitative surveys of the public, in-depth interviews, archival research, and systematic observations of police-citizen interactions at "community policing" meetings. He conducted in-depth interviews and observations of police-citizen interactions in a major study of three neighborhoods in Washington, DC—funded by the [[National Science Foundation]]. Each neighborhood was either racially or economically distinct—a black middle-class community, white middle-class community, and an impoverished black community. Major differences were found between the three neighborhoods in their perceptions of the DC police and the kinds of interactions and experiences neighborhood residents had with police officers. Prior to this study, Weitzer conducted major research on police-community relations in Northern Ireland, comparing four types of Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods and the impact of policing on each. The study resulted in his 1995 book, ''Policing Under Fire: Ethnic Conflict and Police-Community Relations in Northern Ireland''. Recently, Weitzer has analyzed survey data on Arabs and Jews opinions of the [[Israel Police]]. In 2006, he published a book on Americans' views and personal experiences with the police, entitled ''Race and Policing in America: Conflict and Reform''. This research project was followed by several studies of African Americans and the police in St Louis and East St Louis, published in ''Urban Affairs Review'', ''[[Sociological Quarterly]]'', and ''Journal of Contemporary Ethnography''.

In addition, Weitzer has examined the effects of highly publicized incidents of [[police misconduct]] (such as [[Police brutality|brutality]] and [[Police corruption|corruption]]) on the [[public opinion|public's opinion]] of the police in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]]. This study found that public confidence in the police eroded dramatically after each incident that was given intensive media coverage. Although satisfaction with the police gradually rebounded years after the incident, this process took longer for [[African-Americans]] and [[Hispanics]] than for [[White American|white]] residents of the two cities.&lt;ref&gt;"Incidents of Police Misconduct and Public Opinion" by Ronald Weitzer, ''Journal of Criminal Justice'', 30(5):397–408, 2002. {{DOI|10.1016/S0047-2352(02)00150-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weitzer's earliest research focused on Zimbabwe, where he conducted field research in the early 1980s. At that time, he documented the trend toward a de facto one-party state headed by President Robert Mugabe, whose ruling party relied on repressive security measures and institutions to cripple the political opposition. Mugabe's ruling party (ZANU-PF) used laws inherited from its predecessor—the white-minority regime, which collapsed in 1980 and gave way to majority rule.  The pattern of de facto one-party rule and repression of political opposition has continued for 30 years, up to the present time. Weitzer's research was published in a groundbreaking 1984 article titled "In Search of Regime Security: Zimbabwe since Independence" in the ''Journal of Modern African Studies'' and in his book, ''Transforming Settler States: Communal Conflict and Internal Security in Northern Ireland and Zimbabwe'' (published by University of California Press, 1990). This early research set the stage for his subsequent investigation of counterinsurgency policing and ethnic conflict in Northern Ireland and his many studies of police relations with minority groups in the United States.

'''Sex-positive feminism''', also known as '''pro-sex feminism''', '''sex-radical feminism''', or '''sexually liberal feminism''', is a movement that began in the early 1980s centering on the idea that [[sexual freedom]] is an essential component of women's freedom.

Some became involved in the [[sex-positive]] feminist movement in response to efforts by [[Feminist views on pornography#Anti-pornography feminism|anti-pornography feminists]] to put [[pornography]] at the center of a feminist explanation of women's oppression.&lt;ref name="McElroy_1995" /&gt; This period of intense debate and acrimony between sex-positive and anti-pornography feminists during the early 1980s is often referred to as the [[feminist sex wars]]. Other feminists identifying as sex-positive became involved in the debate, not in opposition to other feminists, but in direct response to what they saw as patriarchal control of sexuality.

Some radical feminists reject the dichotomy of "sex-positive" and "sex-negative" feminism, suggesting that instead, the real divide is between [[liberal feminism]] and [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Meghan. "[http://www.feministcurrent.com/2014/04/11/the-divide-isnt-between-sex-negative-and-sex-positive-feminists-its-between-liberals-and-radicals/ The divide isn't between 'sex negative' and 'sex positive' feminists — it's between liberal and radical feminism]". ''Feminist Current''. Published April 11, 2014. Retrieved December 24, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who have advocated sex-positive feminism include [[Kathy Acker]], [[Camille Paglia]], [[Megan Andelloux]], [[Susie Bright]], [[Rachel Kramer Bussel]], [[Diana Cage]], [[Avedon Carol]], [[Patrick Califia]], [[Betty Dodson]], [[Nancy Friday]], [[Jane Gallop]], [[Laci Green]], [[Nina Hartley]], [[Josephine Ho]], [[Amber L. Hollibaugh]], [[Brenda Howard]], [[Laura Kipnis]], [[Wendy McElroy]], [[Inga Muscio]], [[Joan Nestle]], [[Carol Queen]], [[Candida Royalle]], [[Gayle Rubin]], [[Annie Sprinkle]], [[Tristan Taormino]] and [[Ellen Willis]].

Sex-positive feminism centers on the idea that [[sexual freedom]] is an essential component of women's freedom. As such, sex-positive feminists oppose legal or social efforts to control sexual activities between consenting adults, whether they are initiated by the government, other feminists, opponents of feminism, or any other institution. They embrace sexual minority groups, endorsing the value of [[coalition]]-building with marginalized groups. Sex-positive feminism is connected with the [[sex-positive movement]].

[[Gayle Rubin]] summarizes the conflict over sex within feminism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...There have been two strains of feminist thought on the subject. One tendency has criticized the restrictions on women's sexual behavior and denounced the high costs imposed on women for being sexually active. This tradition of feminist sexual thought has called for a sexual liberation that would work for women as well as for men. The second tendency has considered sexual liberalization to be inherently a mere extension of male privilege. This tradition resonates with conservative, anti-sexual discourse.&lt;ref name="Rubin_1984" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The sex-positive feminism cause brings together anti-[[censorship]] activists, [[LGBT]] activists, feminist scholars, sex radicals, producers of pornography and [[erotica]], among others (though not all members of these groups are necessarily both feminists and sex-positive people). Sex-positive feminists reject the [[vilification]] of male sexuality that many attribute to [[radical feminism]], and instead embrace the entire range of human sexuality. They argue that the patriarchy limits sexual expression and are in favor of giving people of all genders more sexual opportunities, rather than restricting pornography.&lt;ref name="Queen_1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Queen | first = Carol | author-link = Carol Queen | title = Real live nude girl: chronicles of sex-positive culture | publisher = Cleis Press | location = Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania | year = 1997 | isbn = 9781573440738 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-positive feminists generally reject [[sexual essentialism]], defined by Rubin as "the idea that sex is a natural force that exists prior to social life and shapes institutions". Rather, they see sexual orientation and gender as social constructs that are heavily influenced by society.&lt;ref name="Rubin_1984" /&gt;

Sex-radical feminists in particular, come to a sex-positive stance from a deep distrust in the patriarchy's ability to secure women's best interest in sexually limiting laws. Other feminists identify women's sexual liberation as the real motive behind the women's movement. [[Naomi Wolf]] writes, "Orgasm is the body's natural call to feminist politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Wolf | first = Naomi | author-link = Naomi Wolf | title = Feminist Fatale: a reply to Camille Paglia | work = [[The New Republic]] | date = 16 March 1992 | url = https://www.unz.org/Pub/NewRepublic-1992mar16-00023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sharon Presley]], the National Coordinator of the Association of Libertarian Feminists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140731170021/http://www.alf.org/ | archive-date = 31 July 2014 | url = http://www.alf.org/  | website = alf.org | publisher = Association of Libertarian Feminists }}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that in the area of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], government blatantly discriminates against women.

The social background in which sex-positive feminism operates must also be understood: Christian societies are often influenced by what is understood as 'traditional' sexual morality: according to the Christian doctrine, sexual activity must only take place in marriage, and must be vaginal intercourse; sexual acts outside marriage and 'unnatural sex' (i.e. oral, anal sex, termed as "[[sodomy]]") are forbidden; yet [[marital rape|forced sexual intercourse within marriage]] is not seen as immoral by a few social and religious conservatives, owing to the existence of so-called 'conjugal rights'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conjugal%20rights|title=Conjugal Rights (definition) | website = merriam-webster.com |publisher= [[Merriam-Webster]] | accessdate = 22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bonimy | first = Jasmin | title = Marital rape ban ‘tragically wrong’ says the Christian Council | url = http://crisiscentrebahamas.wordpress.com/2009/09/07/marital-rape-ban-tragically-wrong-says-the-christian-council/

In addition, in certain cultures, particularly in [[List of Mediterranean countries|Mediterranean]] countries influenced by [[Roman Catholicism]], traditional ideas of [[masculinity]] and female purity. This has led to what many interpret as a [[double standard]] between [[male sexuality|male]] and [[female sexuality]]; men are expected to be sexually assertive as a way of affirming their [[masculinity]], but for a woman to be considered 'good', she must remain pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Aboim | first = Sofia | contribution = Of pleasure and violence: sex and sexuality in men's discourses | editor-last = Aboim | editor-first = Sofia | title = Plural masculinities: the remaking of the self in private life | pages = 137–156 | publisher = Ashgate Pub.

== Historical roots ==
[[File:Carol Queen, 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carol Queen]], a sociologist, sexologist and sex-positive feminist]]

Authors such as [[Gayle Rubin]] and [[Wendy McElroy]] see the roots of sex-positive feminism stemming from the work of sex reformers and workers for sex education and access to contraception, such as [[Havelock Ellis]], [[Margaret Sanger]], [[Mary Dennett]] and, later, [[Alfred Kinsey]] and [[Shere Hite]].&lt;ref name="Rubin_1984"&gt;{{citation | last = Rubin | first = Gayle S. | author-link = Gayle Rubin | contribution = Thinking sex: notes for a radical theory of the politics of sexuality | editor-last = Vance | editor-first = Carole | title = Pleasure and danger: exploring female sexuality | pages = 267–319 | publisher = Routledge &amp; K. Paul | location = Boston | year = 1984 | isbn = 9780710202482 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McElroy_1995"&gt;{{cite book | last = McElroy | first = Wendy | author-link = Wendy McElroy | title = XXX: a woman's right to pornography | publisher = St. Martin's Press | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780312136260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the contemporary incarnation of sex-positive feminism appeared more recently, following an increasing feminist focus on pornography as a source of women's oppression in the 1970s. The rise of [[second-wave feminism]] was concurrent with the [[sexual revolution]] and rulings that loosened legal restrictions on access to pornography. In the 1970s, [[radical feminists]] became increasingly focused on issues around sexuality in a [[patriarchal]] society. Some feminist groups began to concern themselves with prescribing what proper feminist sexuality should look like. This was especially characteristic of [[lesbian separatist]] groups, but some heterosexual women's groups, such as [[Redstockings]], became engaged with this issue as well. On the other hand, there were also feminists, such as [[Betty Dodson]], who saw women's sexual pleasure and masturbation as central to women's liberation. Pornography was not a major issue during this era; radical feminists were generally opposed to pornography, but the issue was not treated as especially important until the mid-1970s. There were, however, feminist prostitutes-rights advocates, such as [[COYOTE]], which campaigned for the decriminalization of [[prostitution]].

The late 1970s found American culture becoming increasingly concerned about the aftermath of a decade of greater sexual freedom, including concerns about explicit violent and sexual imagery in the media, the mainstreaming of pornography, increased sexual activity among teenagers, and issues such as the dissemination of [[child pornography]] and the purported rise of "[[snuff films]]".{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} (Critics maintain that this atmosphere amounted to a [[moral panic]], which reached its peak in the mid-1980s.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}). These concerns were reflected in the feminist movement, with radical feminist groups claiming that pornography was a central underpinning of patriarchy and a direct cause of [[violence against women]]. Robin Morgan summarized this idea in her statement, "Pornography is the theory; rape the practice."

Andrea Dworkin and Robin Morgan began articulating a vehemently anti-porn stance based in radical feminism beginning in 1974, and anti-porn feminist groups, such as [[Women Against Pornography]] and similar organizations, became highly active in various US cities during the late 1970s. As anti-porn feminists broadened their criticism and activism to include not only pornography, but prostitution and sadomasochism, other feminists became concerned about the direction the movement was taking and grew more critical of anti-porn feminism. This included feminist [[BDSM]] practitioners (notably [[Samois]]), prostitutes-rights advocates, and many liberal and anti-authoritarian feminists for whom free speech, sexual freedom, and advocacy of women's [[Moral agency|agency]] were central concerns.

One of the earliest feminist arguments against this anti-pornography trend amongst feminists was [[Ellen Willis]]'s essay ''"Feminism, Moralism, and Pornography"'' first published in October 1979 in the ''[[Village Voice]]''.&lt;ref name="Willis_1992a"&gt;{{cite news | last =Willis | first = Ellen | author-link =Ellen Willis | title = Feminism, moralism, and pornography | work = [[The Village Voice]] |date= October 1979 }}

Rubin criticizes anti-pornography feminists who she claims "have condemned virtually every variant of sexual expression as anti-feminist," arguing that their view of sexuality is dangerously close to anti-feminist, conservative sexual morality. Rubin encourages feminists to consider the political aspects of sexuality without promoting [[sexual repression]]. She also argues that the blame for women's oppression should be put on targets who deserve it: "the family, religion, education, child-rearing practices, the media, the state, psychiatry, job discrimination, and unequal pay..." rather than on relatively un-influential sexual minorities.&lt;ref name="Rubin_1984" /&gt;

McElroy (1995) argues that for feminists in the 1970s and 1980s, turning to matters of sexual expression was a result of frustration with feminism's apparent failure to achieve success through political channels: in the United States, the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA) had failed, and [[abortion]] rights came under attack during the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration.

China scholar Elaine Jeffreys observes that the 'anti-prostitute' position gained increased critical purchase during the establishment of the international movement for prostitutes in 1985, demanding recognition of prostitutes' rights as an emancipation and labor issue rather than of criminality, immorality or disease. By the 2000s, the positive-sex position had driven various international human rights NGOs to actively pressure the Chinese government to abandon its official policy of banning prostitution in post-reform China and recognize voluntary prostitution as legitimate work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jeffreys | first = Elaine | title = Sex and sexuality in China | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780415546973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Jeffreys | first = Elaine | contribution = Feminist prostitution debates: are there any sex workers in China? | editor-last1 = Edwards | editor-first1 = Louise | editor-last2 = Roces | editor-first2 = Mina | title = Women in Asia: critical concepts in Asian studies | pages = 301–325 | publisher = Routledge | location = Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780415445290 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related major political issues ==

===Pornography===
{{further|Feminist views on pornography|Opposition to pornography}}
The issue of pornography was perhaps the first issue to unite sex-positive feminists, though current sex-positive views on the subject are wide-ranging and complex. During the 1980s, Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon, as well as activists inspired by their writings, worked in favor of anti-pornography ordinances in a number of U.S. cities, as well as in Canada. The first such ordinance was passed by the city council in [[Minneapolis]] in 1983. MacKinnon and Dworkin took the tactic of framing pornography as a [[civil rights]] issue, arguing that showing pornography constituted sex [[discrimination]] against women. The sex-positive movement response to this argument was that legislation against pornography violates women's right to free speech. Soon after, a coalition of anti-porn feminists and right-wing groups succeeded in passing a similar ordinance in [[Indianapolis]]. This ordinance was later declared unconstitutional by a Federal court in [[American Booksellers v. Hudnut]].

Rubin writes that anti-pornography feminists exaggerate the dangers of pornography by showing the most shocking pornographic images (such as those associated with [[sadomasochism]]) out of context, in a way that implies that the women depicted are actually being raped, rather than emphasizing that these scenes depict fantasies and use actors who have consented to be shown in such a way.&lt;ref name="Rubin_1984" /&gt; Sex-positive feminists argue that access to pornography is as important to women as to men and that there is nothing inherently degrading to women about pornography.&lt;ref name="McElroy_1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = McElroy | first = Wendy | author-link = Wendy McElroy | title = Sexual correctness: the gender-feminist attack on women | publisher = McFarland | location = Jefferson, N.C | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780786402267 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strossen_2000"&gt;{{cite book | last = Strossen | first = Nadine | author-link = Nadine Strossen | title = Defending pornography: free speech, sex, and the fight for women's rights | publisher = New York University Press | location = New York London | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780814781494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-pornography feminists , however , disagree, often arguing that the very depiction of such acts leads to the actual acts being encouraged and committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last = Dworkin | first = Andrea | author-link = Andrea Dworkin | contribution = Pornography is a civil rights issue: 1986 | editor-last = Dworkin | editor-first = Andrea | editor-link = Andrea Dworkin | title = Letters from a War Zone: Writings, 1976-1989 | pages = 276–307 | publisher = E.P.

===Sex work===
{{further|Feminist views on prostitution}}
Some sex-positive feminists believe that women and men can have positive experiences as sex workers and that where it is illegal, prostitution should be decriminalized. They argue that prostitution is not necessarily bad for women if prostitutes are treated with respect and if the professions within sex work are destigmatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/28/a-feminists-argument-on-how-sex-work-can-benefit-women|title=A Feminist's Argument on How Sex Work Can Benefit Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627041717/http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/28/a-feminists-argument-on-how-sex-work-can-benefit-women|archive-date=2016-06-27|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Comte|first=Jacqueline|date=2014-03-01|title=Decriminalization of Sex Work: Feminist Discourses in Light of Research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-013-9174-5|journal=Sexuality &amp; Culture|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=196–217|doi=10.1007/s12119-013-9174-5|issn=1095-5143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sex-positive feminists hold a range of views on prostitution, with widely varying views on prostitution as it relates to [[Social class|class]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[human trafficking]], and many other issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Sexuality, Gender, and the Body|url=https://genderbodyreligion.wordpress.com/2008/09/22/sex-positive-feminism/|title=Sex-positive feminism (blog)|website=genderbodyreligion.wordpress.com | publisher = [[WordPress]] | date = 22 September 2008|access-date=3 February 2017}} {{Self published inline|certain=yes|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-positive feminists generally agree that prostitutes themselves should not be criminalized or penalized.

===BDSM===
{{main|Feminist views on BDSM}}
[[File:Bondage riggers at nuit blanche.png|thumb|Women acting as [[bondage rigger]]s for other women.]]
[[Sadomasochism]] (BDSM) has been criticized by [[anti porn]] feminists for eroticizing power and violence and for reinforcing [[misogyny]] (Rubin, 1984). They argue that women who choose to engage in BDSM are making a choice that is ultimately bad for women. Sex-positive feminists argue that consensual BDSM activities are enjoyed by many women and validate these women's sexual inclinations. They argue that feminists should not attack other women's sexual desires as being "anti-feminist" or internalizing oppression and that there is no connection between consensual sexually [[kink (sexual)|kinky]] activities and sex crimes. While some anti-porn feminists suggest connections between consensual BDSM [[Scene (BDSM)|scenes]] and [[rape]] and [[sexual assault]], sex-positive feminists find this to be insulting to women. It is often mentioned that in BDSM, roles aren't fixed to [[gender]], but personal preferences. Furthermore, many argue that playing with power (such as rape scenes) through BDSM is a way of challenging and subverting that power, rather than reifying it.

===Sexual orientation===
McElroy argues that many feminists have been afraid of being associated with [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name="McElroy_1995" /&gt; [[Betty Friedan]], one of the founders of second-wave feminism, warned against [[lesbianism]] and called it "the lavender menace" (a view she later renounced).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/02/4-big-problems-with-the-feminine-mystique/273069/|title=4 Big Problems With The Feminine Mystique|last=Fetters|first=Ashley|date=2013-02-12|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-positive feminists believe that accepting the validity of all sexual orientations is necessary in order to allow women full sexual freedom. Rather than distancing themselves from homosexuality and [[bisexuality]] because they fear it will hurt mainstream acceptance of feminism, sex-positive feminists believe that women's liberation cannot be achieved without also promoting acceptance of homosexuality and bisexuality.

===Gender identity===
Some feminists, such as [[Germaine Greer]], have criticized [[transgender]] women ([[male-to-female]]) as men attempting to appropriate female identity while retaining [[male privilege]], and [[transgender]] men ([[female-to-male]]) as women who reject solidarity with their gender. One of the main exponents of this point of view is [[Janice Raymond]].&lt;ref name="Raymond_1979"&gt;{{cite book | last = Raymond | first = Janice | author-link = Janice Raymond | title = The transsexual empire: the making of the she-male | publisher = Beacon Press | location = Boston | year = 1979 | isbn = 9780807021644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Whole Woman]]'',&lt;ref name="Greer_1999"&gt;{{cite book | last = Greer | first = Germaine | author-link = Germaine Greer | title = The whole woman | publisher = A.A. Knopf | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780375407475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greer went so far as to explicitly compare transgender women to rapists for forcing themselves into women's spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Lydia|title=Transgender rights versus feminism: What makes a woman?|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/transgender-rights-versus-feminism-what-makes-woman-1501487 | work = [[International Business Times]] |accessdate=13 November 2016|date=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many transgender people see gender identity as an innate part of a person. Some feminists also criticize this belief, arguing instead that gender roles are societal constructs, and are not related to any natural factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6923912.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Are sex change operations justified? | date=1 August 2007 | accessdate=23 May 2010 | first=Innes | last=Bowen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-positive feminists support the right of all individuals to determine their own gender and promote [[gender fluidity]] as one means for achieving [[gender equality]]. [[Patrick Califia]] has written extensively about issues surrounding feminism and transgender issues, especially in ''Sex Changes: Transgender Politics''.&lt;ref name="Califia_2000"&gt;{{cite book | last = Califia | first = Patrick | author-link = Patrick Califia | title = Sex changes: the politics of transgenderism | publisher = Cleis Press | location = San Francisco | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781573448925 | edition = 2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debates ==

Like feminism itself, sex-positive feminism is difficult to define, and few within the movement (particularly the academic arm of the movement) agree on any one ideology or policy agenda.

An example of how feminists may disagree on whether a particular cultural work exemplifies sex-positivity is Betty Dodson's critique of [[Eve Ensler]]'s ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''. Dodson argues that the play promotes a negative view of sexuality, emphasizing sexual violence against women rather than the redemptive value of female sexuality. Many other sex-positive feminists have embraced Ensler's work for its encouragement of openness about women's bodies and sexuality.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Statutory rape laws===
{{Further|Age of consent|Statutory rape}}
There is debate among sex-positive feminists about whether [[statutory rape]] laws are a form of [[sexism]].&lt;ref name="faqs"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = NOTES | title = Feminist legal analysis and sexual autonomy: using statutory rape laws as an illustration | journal = [[Harvard Law Review]] | volume = 112 | issue = 5 | pages = 1065–1081 | publisher = The Harvard Law Review Association via [[JSTOR]] | doi = 10.2307/1342276 | jstor = 1342276 | date = March 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1342276 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.readabstracts.com/Law/Feminist-legal-analysis-and-sexual-autonomy-using-statutory-rape-laws-as-an-illustration.html Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; As illustrated by the controversy over "The Little Coochie Snorcher that Could" from the Vagina Monologues, some sex-positive feminists do not consider all consensual activity between young adolescents and older people as inherently harmful. There has been debate among feminists about whether statutory rape laws benefit or harm teenage girls, and whether the gender of the participants should influence the way the sexual encounter is dealt with.&lt;ref name="faqs" /&gt; The argument that is brought by some sex-positive feminists against these statutory rape laws is that they were made with non-gender neutral intentions and are presently enforced as such, with the assumption that teenage girls are naive and nonsexual and need to be protected. Sex-positive feminists with this view believe that "teen girls and boys are equally capable of making informed choices in regard to their sexuality",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Oberman | first = Michelle | title = Turning girls into women: re-evaluating modern statutory rape law | journal = [[Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology]] | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = | publisher = [[Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law]] | date = 1994 | url = http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol85/iss1/2 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6807&amp;context=jclc Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; and that statutory rape laws are actually meant to protect "good girls" from sex. In "''Sex-Bias Topics in the Criminal Law Course: A Survey of Criminal Law Professors''" 24 U. Mich. J.L. Ref. 189 (1990),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erickson|first1=Nancy S.|last2=Lamanna|first2=Mary Ann|date=Fall 1990|title=Sex Bias Topics in the Criminal Law Course: A Survey of Criminal Law Professors|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/umijlr24&amp;div=9&amp;src=home|journal=[[University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform]]|publisher=[[University of Michigan Law School]]|volume=24|issue=1|pages=189–252|postscript=.|ref=harv|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is said: "Other feminists are opposed to or ambivalent about strengthening statutory rape statutes because such protection also precludes a young woman from entering a consensual sexual relationship, to which she may be competent to consent. These feminists view statutory rape laws as more controlling than protective – and of course part of the law's historic role was protecting the female's chastity as valuable property". She also noted that, at that time, in some states, the previous sexual experience of a teenager could be used as a defense by one accused of statutory rape. She argued that this showed that the laws were intended to protect ideas of chastity rather than issues of consent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Critiques ==
Works that critique sex-positive feminism includes those of [[Catharine MacKinnon]],&lt;ref name="MacKinnon_1987"&gt;{{cite book | last = MacKinnon | first = Catharine | author-link = Catharine MacKinnon | title = Feminism unmodified: discourses on life and law | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1987 | isbn = 9780674298743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germaine Greer]],&lt;ref name="Greer_1999" /&gt; [[Pamela Paul]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Paul | first = Pamela | author-link = Pamela Paul | title = [[Pornified|Pornified: how pornography is transforming our lives, our relationships, and our families]] | publisher = Times Books | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780805081329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the essays by [[Dorchen Leidholdt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Leidholdt | first1 = Dorchen | last2 = Raymond | first2 = Janice | author-link1 = Dorchen Leidholdt | author-link2 = Janice Raymond | title = The sexual liberals and the attack on feminism | publisher = Pergamon Press | location = New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780807762394 }}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Their main arguments are that certain sexual practices (such as prostitution and pornography) exploit women and have historically benefited men rather than women and that the indiscriminate promotion of all kinds of sexual practices merely contributes to female oppression. Catharine MacKinnon argues that any concept of sexual liberation must be understood within the framework of male domination in society, in the context of an imbalance of power between men and women, and with due regard to the history of male and female sexuality; she writes: "Men have eroticized the idea that their sexuality has been denied, but their sexuality has been nothing but expressed and expressed and expressed. Sexual liberation, from this perspective, looks like a male rationalization for forcing sex on women."&lt;ref name="MacKinnon_1987"/&gt;

In her 2005 book ''[[Female Chauvinist Pigs]]'', [[Ariel Levy (journalist)|Ariel Levy]] also critiques sex-positive feminism. While not opposed to sex-positive feminism per se, nor wishing specifically to prescribe certain forms of sexual behavior, she sees a popularized form of sex-positivity as constituting a kind of "raunch culture" in which women internalize [[sexual objectification|objectifying]] male views of themselves and other women. Levy believes it is a mistake to see this as empowering and further holds that women should develop their own forms of sexual expression.&lt;ref name="Levy_2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Levy | first = Ariel | author-link = Ariel Levy (journalist) | title = Female chauvinist pigs: women and the rise of raunch culture | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780743249898 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The response by sex-positive feminists to Levy's book has been mixed; [[Susie Bright]] viewed the book quite favorably, stating that much of what can be seen as "raunch culture" represents a bastardization of the work of earlier sex-positive feminists such as herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bright | first = Susie (blog) | author-link = Susie Bright | title = Susie Bright's Journal: ''Female Chauvinist Pigs'' at the trough | url = http://susiebright.blogs.com/susie_brights_journal_/2005/09/female_chauvini.html | website = susiebright.blogs.com | publisher = [[Susie Bright]] via Blogs.com | date = 30 September 2005 }} {{Self published inline|certain = yes|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Rachel Kramer Bussel]], see Levy as largely ignoring much of the female-empowered sexual expression of the last 20 years, or misinterpreting it as internalization of male fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lusty Lady (blog) | title = Beyond ''Pornified'' and ''Female Chauvanist Pigs'' | url = http://lustylady.blogspot.com/2005/09/beyond-pornified-and-female-chauvinist.html | website = lustylady.blogspot.com | publisher = [[Rachel Kramer Bussel]] via [[Blogspot]] | date = 21 September 2005 }} {{Self published inline|certain = yes|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lusty Lady (blog) | title = Tristan Taormino interview at suicide + ''Female Chauvanist Pigs'' | url = http://lustylady.blogspot.com/2005/09/tristan-taormino-interview-at-suicide.html | website = lustylady.blogspot.com | publisher = [[Rachel Kramer Bussel]] via [[Blogspot]] | date = 19 September 2005 }} {{Self published inline|certain = yes|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kara Jesella argued that sex-positivity may not necessarily be empowering, but it may also not be disempowering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Jesella | first =Kara | title = Revolution girl style now! | url = http://www.nerve.com/screeningroom/books/femalechauvinistpigs | work = [[Nerve (website)|Nerve]] | publisher = [[HowAboutWe]] | date = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorchen Leidholdt argues that "sex" (the way sexuality is expressed in society) must be understood as a social construct defined by patriarchal social structures, and therefore must be scrutinized; she writes, "If you understand that sex is socially constructed—which we do—and if you see that male supremacy does the constructing—which we see—and if the sex in question is the sex men use to establish their dominance over women, then yes we're against it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Leidholdt | first = Dorchen | author-link = Dorchen Leidholdt | title = When women defend pornography | url = http://www.anusha.com/leidholdt.htm | website = anusha.com | publisher = [[Sam Sloan]] |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ann Ferguson]], sex-positive feminists' only restriction on sexual activity should be the requirement of consent, yet she argues that sex-positive feminism has provided inadequate definitions of consent.&lt;ref name="Ferguson_1984"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ferguson | first = Ann | author-link = Ann Ferguson | title = Sex war: the debate between radical and libertarian feminists | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]] | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 110–111 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | doi = 10.1086/494117 | jstor = 3174240 | date = Autumn 1984| url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/494117 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in an effort to reconcile radical and libertarian feminism, Ferguson argues that sexual behavior should be either basic, risky, or forbidden, specifying that forbidden sexual practices "include incest, rape, domestic violence, and sexual relations between very young children and adults,"&lt;ref name="Ferguson_1984" /&gt; as well as any other activities for which there is evidence of resulting subordination.  This evidence is key for Ferguson in identifying a forbidden sexual activity.  Since consent is so problematically defined, Ferguson's categorization of forbidden sexual activity circumvents the issue of consent entirely.

Authors and activists who have written important works about sex-positive feminism, and/or contributed to educating the public about it, include [[Kathy Acker]], [[Megan Andelloux]], [[Susie Bright]], [[Rachel Kramer Bussel]], [[Diana Cage]], [[Avedon Carol]], [[Patrick Califia]], [[Betty Dodson]], [[Nancy Friday]], [[Jane Gallop]], [[Nina Hartley]], [[Josephine Ho]], [[Amber L. Hollibaugh]], [[Brenda Howard]], [[Laura Kipnis]], [[Wendy McElroy]], [[Inga Muscio]], [[Joan Nestle]], [[Erika Lust]], [[Carol Queen]], [[Candida Royalle]], [[Gayle Rubin]], [[Annie Sprinkle]], [[Tristan Taormino]] and [[Ellen Willis]]. Several of these have written from the perspective of feminist women working in the sex industry.

Information on formal organizations that endorse sex-positive feminism seems lacking but one major outpost of sex-positive feminism is the former cooperative business [[Good Vibrations (business)|Good Vibrations]] founded by [[Joani Blank]] in 1977 in order to sell sex toys and publications about sex in an environment welcoming to women. Blank also founded Down There Press which has published various educational publications inspired by sex-positivity. There are a number of other sex-positive feminist businesses who thrive on a combination of sex toy sales and distribution of educational materials. Good For Her, a woman-owned sex-toy shop in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], holds an annual [[Feminist Porn Award]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Van Deven | first = Mandy | title = Moving beyond the money shot: feminist porn awards | work = [[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]] | publisher = Bitch Media | date = 2 May 2009 | url = http://bitchmagazine.org/post/moving-beyond-the-money-shot-feminist-porn-awards | accessdate = 3 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonprofit groups supporting sex-positive feminism include the currently defunct Feminist Anti-Censorship Task Force associated with Carole Vance and Ann Snitow, Feminists for Free Expression, and [[Feminists Against Censorship]] associated with anti-censorship and civil liberties campaigner [[Avedon Carol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Carol | first = Avedon | author-link = Avedon Carol | title = Nudes, prudes, and attitudes: pornography and censorship | publisher = New Clarion Press | location = Cheltenham | year = 1994 | isbn = 9781873797136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist pornography]] is a small but growing{{fact|date=October 2018}} segment of the [[pornography industry]]. A [[Feminist Porn Award]] was established in 2006. The equivalent in Europe is the [[PorYes]] award for feminist porn, established in 2009. The magazine ''[[On Our Backs]]'' was founded in 1986 to promote a more positive attitude towards erotica within the community of lesbian and bisexual women. It flourished until 1994, struggled with financial problems and changing ownership and the final edition was published in 2006.

A '''superstate''' is defined as "a large and powerful [[State (polity)|state]] formed when several smaller countries unite",&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/it/dizionario/inglese/superstate "Superstate"], Cambridge dictionaries online&lt;/ref&gt; "A large and powerful state formed from a [[federation]] or union of nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/superstate|title=superstate - Definition of superstate in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is distinct from the concept of [[superpower]], although these are sometimes seen together. It is also distinct from the concept of [[empire]], where one nation dominates other nations through military, political, and economic power.

== Use ==
In the early 20th century, "superstate" had a similar definition as today's [[supranational organisation]]s. In a 1927 article by Edward A. Harriman on the [[League of Nations]], a superstate was defined as merely "an organisation, of which a state is a member, which is superior to the member themselves", in that "[a] complete superstate has legislative, executive and judicial organs to make, to execute and to interpret its laws". According to this definition, Harriman saw the League of Nations as a "rudimentary superstate", and the [[United States]] as "an example of a complete and perfect superstate".&lt;ref&gt;Edward A. Harriman, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8716222&amp;fileId=S000305540002373X The League of Nations a Rudimentary Superstate], ''American Political Science Review'' / Volume 21 / Issue 01 / February 1927, pp 137-140&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[World Order of Bahá'u'lláh]],'' first published in 1938, [[Shoghi Effendi]], the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], described the anticipated world government of that religion as the "world’s future super-state" with the Bahá'í Faith as the "State Religion of an independent and Sovereign Power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink= Shoghi Effendi |year=1938 |title=The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA | page=7| chapter= Local and National Houses of Justice| chapter-url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-3.html#pg7| isbn=0-87743-231-7 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, academic literature used the term "superstate" to indicate a particularly rich and powerful state, in a similar fashion to the term [[superpower]].&lt;ref&gt;V. K. WICKRAMASINGHE, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1746-1049.1973.tb00306.x/abstract JAPAN — THE EMERGING SUPERSTATE ? Some Thoughts on Herman Kahn]. ''The Developing Economies'', Volume 11, Issue 2, pages 196–210, June 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary political debate, especially the one centred on the [[European Union]], the term "superstate" is used to indicate a development in which the Union develops from its current ''[[de facto]]'' status&lt;ref&gt;Kiljunen, Kimmo (2004). The European Constitution in the Making. Centre for European Policy Studies. pp. 21–26. {{ISBN|978-92-9079-493-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  as a [[confederation]] to become a fully-fledged [[federation]].
For instance, [[Glyn Morgan (academic)|Glyn Morgan]] contrasts the perspective of a "European superstate" to the ones of "a Europe of nation-states" and of "a post-sovereign European polity".&lt;ref name=morgan&gt;Glyn Morgan, [https://books.google.it/books?id=9WuDA3H3KMwC The Idea of a European Superstate: Public Justification and European Integration] Princeton University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|9781400828050}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|202}} In her definition, a "European superstate is nothing more than a sovereign state - a tried and tested type of polity that predominates in the modern world - operating on a European wide scale",&lt;ref name=morgan/&gt;{{rp|204}} i.e., "a unitary European state".&lt;ref name=morgan/&gt;{{rp|ix}} Especially after the European debt crisis, economic literature started to discuss the role of European union as a European superstate. In particular, &lt;ref name=erkut&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299468883_A_Super_Indebted_European_Superstate|title=A Super Indebted European Superstate|first=Burak|last=Erkut|date=24 December 2015|publisher=|journal=Review of Applied Socio-Economic Research|volume=10|pages=4–10|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared the emergence of a debt union to the federal structure of Germany.  

The term was famously used by [[Margaret Thatcher]] in her 1988 [[Bruges Group (United Kingdom)|Bruges speech]], when she decried the perspective of "a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels",&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Thatcher, [http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107332 Speech to the College of Europe ("The Bruges Speech")], 20 September 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and has since entered the [[euroscepticism|eurosceptic]] lexicon.
[[Tony Blair]] argued in 2000 that he welcomed an EU as a "superpower, not a superstate".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Haseler, [https://books.google.it/books?id=E8eOpF_qZzYC Super-State: The New Europe and Its Challenge to America], p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- All these lack references --
Another examples of superstate include :
* The [[British Empire]] came close to becoming a superstate in the late 19th century when there was an attempt to re-organize both [[dominion]]s and colonies into a single body as an [[Imperial Federation]].
* The [[European Union]], as argued by many [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptics]], is a current example of an emerging superstate.
* The [[Soviet Union]], though being constitutionally defined as [[Republics of the Soviet Union|a union of republics]], was ''de facto'' a superstate due to a major cultural and linguistic diversity between its inhabited ethnicities and they never really identified themselves as the single [[Soviet people|Soviet nation]] despite the official doctrine.
* [[Yugoslavia]] before [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|its breakup]] at the end of the [[Cold War]].

'''Tania''' (1920, Warsaw, Poland, '''Tatiana Lewin''' &amp;ndash; 1982, Brooklyn, New York) was a Polish-born, New York based, Jewish American abstract painter, sculptor, collage artist and painter of city walls.&lt;ref name="Tania obituary"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/26/obituaries/tania-58-designed-paintings-on-city-walls.html?scp=1&amp;sq=tania%2058%20obit&amp;st=cse | title=Tania, 58, Designed Paintings on City Walls | work=New York Times | date=January 26, 1982 | accessdate=5 March 2011 | last=Fraser | first=C.

She was active in the New York art world from 1949 to 1982, but is perhaps best known for her 13-story geometric wall painting of 1970, which still stands at the corner of Mercer St. &amp; 3rd St. in Greenwich Village, New York. In 1966, she became a founding member of City Walls, Inc., a non-profit organization that commissioned abstract artists to paint walls around New York City, and which (when consolidated with the Public Arts Council in 1977) would later become the [[Public Art Fund]].

== Early life and education ==
Tania was born in 1920 in Warsaw, Poland, to Mischa (Michael) and Rosalia (Rose) Lewin. Around 1931, the family emigrated to Paris, where Tania spent the rest of her childhood. The family fled to Montréal, Canada in 1941 following Germany's invasion of France. There, Tania received a Master of Arts from [[McGill University]] before relocating to New York City with her parents in 1943. She began a PhD in French Literature at [[Columbia University]], but left the program with ABD status. In 1949, she began courses at the [[Art Students League of New York]], where she studied painting with [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]], [[Morris Kantor]] and [[Vaclav Vytlacil]].

== Career ==
Over the course of her career, Tania worked in a number of styles before settling on her characteristic geometric abstract style featuring hard-edged triangles. Her early paintings from the late 1940s evidence the influence of her teacher Yasuo Kuniyoshi, both in terms of their subject matter and color palette. In her student years, she exhibited in juried student exhibitions at the Art Students' League. In 1951, she was included in a group show of newcomers at the Creative Gallery. From 1954 to 1958, she made a living designing wallpaper, fabrics and carpets while raising her young children.

Tania had her first "one-man show" at Albert Landry Gallery in 1959. She asked [[Ad Reinhardt]] to help her hang the show. Through the early 1960s, she worked primarily in collage and assemblage. This phase featured abstract collages of corrugated cardboard and paint as well as more heavily Pop-influenced collages and wood assemblages featuring signage, advertising and other found materials. She exhibited several of these colorful wood sculptures in her 1963 solo show at Bertha Schaefer Gallery under the name "Color Structures."  During this time, Tania also exhibited what she called her "complementary paintings," works comprising two abutted canvases. These "complementary" (or "binary" works) typically combined collaged canvases with monochrome ones. In a related set of works on paper, she mounted collages opposite her own poetry in French. Her 1961 show at Landry Gallery included complementary paintings and corrugated board collages, but also several large-scale "environments." In 1962, sponsored by Ad Reinhardt, [[Philip Pearlstein]] and Pandolfini, she was elected as a member of [[9th Street Art Exhibition|The Artists' Club]]. She began teaching at [[New York University]] in 1963.

Two drawings housed in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art show that Tania had arrived at her geometric style at least by 1967. She produced paintings and prints featuring variations on her characteristic "overlapping triangles" composition. In this period, she also produced large-scale aluminum sculptures that translated the overlapping triangles composition into multi-planar, three-dimensional form. Examples of this type of sculpture can be seen in the Kingsborough Community College  Marine &amp; Academic Center building in Brooklyn and on the library at  Albright College in Reading, PA. In a statement from 1978, Tania likened her triangles to rooftops, seen from above: "For a few years now I have been thinking of my paintings (always executed on the floor) as roof tops seen from the air - in the clouds - in the sun - in the night. The paintings have become sketches for buildings planned from the top down...The [[Spiral Jetty]] of [[Robert Smithson|Smithson]] could be done in the City."

From roughly 1966, when she co-founded City Walls Inc., Tania had begun to devote much of her energy to public and outdoor art projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nostradamusnews.net/wp0.htm|deadurl=bot: unknown|title=NYC WallPainting 1967-69|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723230049/http://www.nostradamusnews.net/wp0.htm|archivedate=2011-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the sponsorship of City Walls, she painted walls at Evergreen &amp; Weirfield Aves in Brooklyn (1968), Bryant &amp; Lafayette Aves in the Bronx (1968), and at Mercer &amp; 3rd St. in Manhattan (1970), but only the Manhattan wall remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bromberg|first=David H.|title=List of NYC Walls, 1967-1969|url=http://www.nostradamusnews.net/Wall%20List1.jpg|accessdate=28 February 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723230111/http://www.nostradamusnews.net/Wall%20List1.jpg|archivedate=23 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972, she collaborated with [[Nassos Daphnis]] to produce a temporary "environment in process" by painting various surfaces at the construction site of a high-rise in Times Square—from the building's skeleton, to the surrounding plywood scaffolding, to construction workers' shoes and toolboxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Way Things Could Be|journal=New York Magazine|date=13 September 1971|volume=4|issue=37|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lelyveld|first=Joseph|title=Painting Adorns Building Frame|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 5, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author="", Tania | title=Artist's Resume | year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tania commented in her writings about the difficulty of being a woman artist who painted geometric abstractions. In one unpublished autobiographical text she writes, "My paintings were 'too large for a woman,' said the New York Times ...I painted like a man... I guess I was supposed to paint flowers."

'''Turks in Moldova''' are [[Turkish people]] who live in [[Moldova]] even though having been born outside Moldova, or are Moldovan-born, but have Turkish roots. By Turkish roots, this could mean roots linking back to [[Turkey]], the island of [[Cyprus]] or the communities of the [[Turkish diaspora]].

== Facts and figures ==
According to Moldova figures, the number of residents born in Turkey is steadily increasing (note that these figures do not include the Moldova born Turks):

The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] is involved with a wide spectrum of public works projects:  environmental protection, water supply, recreation, flood damage and reduction, beach nourishment, homeland security, military construction, and support to other Governmental agencies. Through 19 [[Flood Control Act]]s since 1917, Congress has authorized the Corps of Engineers to be involved with flood protection and damage reduction in almost every state of the union.

Corps of Engineers' projects are either authorized specifically by Congress or as part of a Congressionally authorized category of projects. Projects are authorized and built in all fifty states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usace.army.mil |title=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Home Page |publisher=Usace.army.mil |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local citizen, special interest, and political groups can lobby Congress for authorization and appropriations for specific projects in their area. In contrast, locals have also opposed corps projects or parts of projects.&lt;ref name=GAOReport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d051050t.pdf |title=GAO-05-1050T Army Corps of Engineers: Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity Hurricane Protection Project |format=PDF |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Corps of Engineers' civil works projects have been characterized as being riddled with patronage (see [[pork barrel]]) or a waste of money and resources (see [[boondoggle (project)]]), such as the [[New Madrid Floodway Project]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grunwald |first=Michael |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1663903,00.html?xid=feed-cnn-topics |title=Reining in the Corps of Engineers |work=TIME |date=20 September 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the New Orleans flood protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grunwald |first=Michael |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1646611_1646683_1648904,00.html |title=The Threatening Storm – Hurricane Katrina – Two Years Later |work=TIME |date=2 August 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects have allegedly been justified based on flawed or manipulated analyses during the planning phase. Some projects are said to have created profound detrimental environmental effects and/or provided questionable economic benefit such as the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet in southeast Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mrgomustgo.org/ |title=Close the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet – The Hurricane Highway |publisher=Mrgomustgo.org |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faulty design and substandard construction have been cited in the failure of levees in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|page=707 |author=J.

One of the difficulties of making changes, however, is the political process itself.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/featurex/2007/08/broken-the-army-corps-of-engineers.html |title=Broken: The Army Corps of Engineers |publisher=Mother Jones |date=26 August 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://archive.is/20081031075451/http://feingold.senate.gov/~feingold/statements/06/07/20060719corpsreform.htm Statement of U.S. Senator Russ Feingold On Reforming the Army Corps of Engineers]&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending on the point of view of any debate on these projects, they may or may not be considered sound from an engineering standpoint (see below). Whether or not USACE planners and engineers actually do the best they can with what they are directed to do is part of the controversy.

==Levee Failures in New Orleans During Hurricane Katrina==
{{see also|2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans|Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil works controversies (New Orleans)}}

===Description of Failures===
On August 29, 2005, [[Hurricane Katrina]] passed to the east of New Orleans, the Corps's flood protection failed catastrophically with [[levee]] breaches in over 50 places. The levee failures caused massive flooding in New Orleans with associated property loss and drownings. When Katrina arrived, the hurricane protection authorized was between 60–90% complete; the projected date of completion was estimated to be 2015.

===Authorization in the Flood Control Act of 1965===
The [[Flood Control Act of 1965]] (FCA 1965), enacted after [[Hurricane Betsy]] flooded large sections of New Orleans, mandated the US Army Corps of Engineers as the Federal agency responsible for levee design and construction. Among other projects and studies, FCA 1965 authorized the Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity, Louisiana Hurricane Protection Project. The project was to construct a series of control structures, concrete floodwalls, and levees to provide hurricane protection to areas around Lake Pontchartrain. Although federally authorized, it was a joint federal, state, and local effort.&lt;ref name="GAOReport"/&gt;  The state and local effort was handled by the [[Orleans Levee Board]] which provided operational control and maintenance of the levees after the corps turned completed structures over to it.

=== Investigations of the levee failures ===
In October 2005, Lt. Gen. Carl Strock, [[Chief of Engineers]] and the Commander of the Corps of Engineers, established the Interagency Performance Evaluation Task Force (IPET) to "provide credible and objective scientific and engineering answers to fundamental questions about the performance of the hurricane protection and flood damage reduction system in the New Orleans metropolitan area.&lt;ref name=IPET&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/Portals/70/docs/projects/29Jan07/IPET_Summary_USGS.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Final Draft, Vol I_2Jun08_mh.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPET membership consisted of multiple employees of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, past and present, as well as individuals from academia, other states, water experts, and other Federal agencies.

An October 2005, [[Washington Post]] article reported that "...local officials often resisted proposals to protect their communities from storms because they did not want to pay their share of federal projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grunwald|first=Michael|last2=Glasser|first2= Susan|title=The Slow Drowning of New Orleans|publisher=The Washington Post|date=February 10, 2016|accessdate=2016-02-10|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/08/AR2005100801458_pf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this claim was refuted in an August 2015 report published in Water Policy, the official journal of [[World Water Council.]] The authors concluded, "... we have not uncovered any information that would suggest that the members of the OLB who served on the Engineering Committee or the OLD staff engineers behaved irresponsibly or in a manner that did not place the interests of the city residents at the forefront...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|page=721 |author=J.

In June 2006, General Strock accepted responsibility on behalf of the Corps for the failure of the flood protection, calling it "a system in name only." Faulty design specifications and incomplete or substandard construction of levee segments contributed to the failure of the flood protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwartz |first=John |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/01/us/01cnd-corps.html

In April 2007, the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE) began referring to the flooding as the worst engineering catastrophe in US history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/katrina/reports/ERPreport.pdf |title=The New Orleans Levees: The Worst Engineering Catastrophe in US History – What Went Wrong and Why |publisher=Eng.auburn.edu |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 1, 2007, the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] issued its External Peer Review (ERP) report,&lt;ref&gt;http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/katrina/reports/ERPreport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the peer review of the Corps-sponsored IPET and also an accompanying press release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buhrman|first=Joan|title=Move Beyond Sound-bites and "Armchair" Theories to Make the Nation Safer from Disaster, Engineers Say|publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers|date=June 1, 2007|accessdate=2016-02-10|url= http://levees.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ASCE_Press_Release_June.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the press release was criticized because it contained information that was not present in the report, included information that conflicted with the report, and minimized the Army Corps' involvement in the catastrophe. The press release stated, “Even without breaching, Hurricane Katrina’s rainfall and surge overtopping would have caused extensive and severe flooding—and the worst loss of life and property loss ever experienced in New Orleans.” Meanwhile, the ERP report stated that had levees and pump stations not failed, “far less property loss would have occurred and nearly two-thirds of deaths could have been avoided.”

On 9 July 2007, retired LtG Elvin "Vald" Heiberg III, stated in a letter to the New Orleans Times Picayune that people should blame him for the Katrina disaster. He says that, as Commander of the New Orleans District and later as the Commander of the Corps of Engineers in the mid 1980s, he gave in to local interests{{snd}} notably, ''Save Our Wetlands''{{snd}} too easily after various legal challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pope|first=John|title=Lt.

The corps had not been forced to do anything against its will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | page=179 | author=Douglas A. Kysar, Tomas O. McGarityl | title=Did NEPA Drown New Orleans?

The IPET draft findings indicate that, {{quote|With the exception of four foundation design failures, all of the major breaches were caused by overtopping and subsequent erosion. Reduced protective elevations increased the amount of overtopping, erosion, and subsequent flooding, particularly in eastern New Orleans. The structures that ultimately breached performed as designed, providing protection until overtopping occurred and then becoming vulnerable to catastrophic breaching. The levee-floodwall designs for the 17th Street and London Avenue Outfall Canals and IHNC were inadequate. In these cases, the structures failed catastrophically prior to water reaching design elevations. A significant number of structures that were subjected to water levels beyond their design limits performed well. Typically, in the case of floodwalls, they represented more conservative design assumptions and, for levees, use of higher quality, less erodible materials.&lt;ref name=IPET /&gt;}}

In October 2007, Dr. Ray Seed, University of California-Berkeley civil engineering Professor and ASCE member submitted an ethics complaint to the ASCE alleging that the corps with the help of the ASCE sought to minimize the corps' mistakes in the flooding, intimidate anyone who tried to intervene and delay the final results until the public's attention had turned elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.nola.com/times-picayune/2007/11/WFMarcusonIII_a_.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - W F Marcuson III_a_.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=26 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609203324/http://blog.nola.com/times-picayune/2007/11/WFMarcusonIII_a_.pdf |archivedate=9 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The corps acknowledged receiving a copy of the letter but has refused to comment until after the ASCE's Committee on Professional Conduct (CPC), led by Rich Hovey, comments on the complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Charpentier|first=Colley|title=Critic: Corps tried to thwart inquiry New Orleans Times-Picayune | publisher=The Times-Picayune | date=November 19, 2007 | accessdate=2016-02-10|url=http://blog.nola.com/times-picayune/2007/11/critic_corps_tried_to_thwart_i.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It took over a year for the ASCE to announce the results of the CPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://levees.org/2/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Levee-group-slams-ASCE-investigation.pdf |title=Levee group slams ASCE investigation |publisher=NOLA.com |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=27 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the results of the internal ethics investigation were announced, the ASCE panel did not file any charges of ethical misconduct against any of its staffers. They blamed their errors in their June press release on "staff level and not by review panel members."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schleifstein |first=Mark |title=American Society of Civil Engineers finds no ethical violations in its own Katrina review |publisher=The Times-Picayune |date=April 6, 2009 |accessdate=2016-02-10 |url=http://content.asce.org/files/pdf/BoehlertReport.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304215333/http://content.asce.org/files/pdf/BoehlertReport.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An external task force led by retired congressman Sherwood Boehlert (R, NY) also conducted an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boehlert|first=Sherwood|title=Report on Engineering Reviews: Recommendations to the American Society of Civil Engineers|publisher=Task Force on Engineering Reviews|date=September 12, 2008 | accessdate=2016-02-10|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/us/decade-after-katrina-pointing-finger-more-firmly-at-army-corps.html?_r=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boehlert's task force was assembled at the request of ASCE in response to Dr. Seed's ethics complaint and also a video produced by Levees.org spoofing the apparent conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nola.com/national/t-p/index.ssf?/base//news-0/122128325453780.xml&amp;coll=1 |title=New Orleans, Louisiana Local News |publisher=Nola.com |accessdate=26 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305235837/http://www.nola.com/national/t-p/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2F%2Fnews-0%2F122128325453780.xml&amp;coll=1 |archivedate=5 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The task force consisted of members from the [National Science Foundation], the [National Academy of Sciences], the [National Institute of Standards and Technology], and the [American Water Works Association].&lt;ref name=Boehlert&gt;http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=MnokuWBvi3gNd20QOoc0iViW3gAm4nN%2B{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The task force's report criticized how ASCE conducts its peer reviews and recommended improvements. Most notably throughout the document was the inadequate "consideration of real or perceived conflict of interest". The task force acknowledged that the "[P]otential conflicts of interest in ASCE's engineering review process are not unique to ASCE and can be addressed through procedures utilized by many government agencies charged with providing unbiased assessments to the public" Mr. Boehlert's task force also praised ASCE by writing, "ASCE has long been respected for its investigatory skill and expertise, and its work on assessments is held in high regard by those in the engineering profession. ... The Task Force believes ASCE remains the best option for conducting post disaster engineering assessments."

The grassroots group, Levees.Org, claimed that the IPET investigation and an expert review panel (ERP) convened by ASCE lacked credibility because of the involvement and management of the Corps of Engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/05/AR2007020501233.html |title=Group Wants 9-11-Style Panel on Levees |work=The Washington Post  |accessdate=26 May 2011 |first=Cain |last=Burdeau |date=6 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group contended that the ERP validating the IPET process was an apparent conflict of interest because the Corps selected the ASCE, directly paid the ASCE over $2 million and awarded the panel members Outstanding Civilian Service Medals (OCSM) before their work was complete. Levees.org was not successful in convincing members of Congress to create an independent levee investigation commission.

===Lawsuits Against the Corps in New Orleans===
In March 2007, the City of New Orleans filed a $77&amp;nbsp;billion claim against the USACE for damages sustained from faulty levee construction and resultant flooding during Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Simmons|first=Ann|title=Katrina Compensation Claims Flood Army Corps of Engineers|publisher= San Francisco Chronicle |date=March 3, 2007 | accessdate= February 22, 2016| url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Katrina-compensation-claims-flood-Army-Corps-of-2614260.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hundreds of thousands of individual claims were also received in the New Orleans branch office of the USACE. In addition to the City of New Orleans, other claimants include Entergy New Orleans, the city's now-bankrupt electric utility, and New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heath |first=Brad |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-08-katrina-corps_N.htm |title=Katrina Claims Stagger Corps |work=USA Today  |date=9 April 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, the [[U.S. District Court]] ruled that the [[Flood Control Act of 1928]] did not apply to cases involving navigational projects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burdeau|first=Cain| title= Rebuking Agency, Judge Dismisses Katrina Lawsuit Against Corps| publisher= Insurance Journal | date= February 1, 2008| accessdate=February 22, 2016| url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southcentral/2008/02/01/86940.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that the Corps may be sued over alleged defects in its Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet navigation channel.

In January 2008, the District Court ruled that even though the US Army Corps of Engineers was negligent and derelict in their duty to provide flood protection for the citizens of New Orleans, he was compelled to dismiss a class action lawsuit filed against the Corps for levee breaches after Hurricane Katrina due to FCA 1928 which protects the federal government from lawsuits over flood control projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burdeau |first=Cain |last2=Kunzelman |first2=Michael |title=Katrina levee lawsuit dismissed |publisher=Associated Press |date=January 31, 2008 |accessdate=2016-02-11 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080131/ap_on_re_us/katrina_levee_suit_20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205115833/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080131/ap_on_re_us/katrina_levee_suit_20 |archivedate=5 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was not appealed.

In November 2009, the US District Court for Eastern Louisiana held the US Army Corps of Engineers responsible for the flooding from the two east IHNC levee breaches (and dozens of others) because the federal agency failed to properly maintain the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO). As of June 2011, the federal government has appealed the ruling.

In April 2010, scholars with the Louisiana State Office of Historic Preservation approved the text for a Historic Plaque for the 17th Street Canal.  After receiving permission from city agencies and the Corps of Engineers, the flood protection group Levees.org installed the Plaque at ground zero, on New Orleans city property, in the Lakeview neighborhood.

The text of the plaque read as follows:

{{cquote|On August 29, 2005, a federal floodwall atop a levee on the 17th Street Canal, the largest and most important drainage canal for the city, gave way here causing flooding that killed hundreds.   This breach was one of 50 ruptures in the federal Flood Protection System that occurred that day.  In 2008, the US District Court placed responsibility for this floodwall's collapse squarely on the US Army Corps of Engineers; however, the agency is protected from financial liability in the Flood Control Act of 1928.}}

===Internet Online Commenting Controversy===
In December 2008, the [[Sandy Rosenthal]] leader of the group Levees.org called a New Orleans CBS affiliate television station and offered to give them an exclusive to publicize several incidences in which employees of the corps used taxpayer-funded computers to post derogatory blog comments deriding citizen activists' efforts. In response to the news story, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers described the event as an isolated incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | title = Corps used the internet to attack its critics | medium = Youtube Video | publisher = Levees.org | location = New Orleans | date = June 18, 2009 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXFK8z9WXo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after the incident was publicized, the Commander of the New Orleans District of the Corps of Engineers, Colonel Alvin Lee, issued a formal apology.  “Please accept my apology for the unprofessional comments someone in my District posted to your web site,” said the letter. “I have reinforced with my entire staff that this was an inappropriate and unacceptable use of our computers and time.”&lt;ref&gt;http://levees.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/document2008-12-18-131845-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 June 2009, US Senator Mary Landrieu ordered a Pentagon investigation into the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=BREAKING NEWS: US Senator will urge the Pentagon to review alleged Corps campaign against critics|publisher=Levees.org|date=June 23, 2009|accessdate=2016-02-11|url= http://levees.org/2009/06/23/breaking-news-us-senator-will-urge-the-pentagon-to-review-alleged-corps-campaign-against-critics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 September 2009, the Department of Defense Inspector General's Office closed its investigation. "We believe that (corps New Orleans District office) officials took appropriate actions once informed of the allegations at issue," Assistant Inspector General John Crane said in a letter to U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. "Accordingly, further review by this agency is not warranted."  Those actions included strongly worded messages to corps employees telling them comments that demeaned corps critics were not allowed. In addition, access to the site of the Levees.org group was blocked from corps computers, preventing employees from commenting there. Lastly, the employee of a contractor—who was a former corps employee himself and was identified as using a government computer to post disparaging remarks on NOLA.com—was barred from working on corps projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/09/department_of_defense_inspecto.html Department of Defense Inspector General closes investigation into allegations of derogatory postings to NOLA.com by Army Corps of Engineers employees | NOLA.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public Relations Controversy===
In 2007, the New Orleans District hired a PR firm, Outreach Process Partners (OPP), allegedly to develop educational materials and set up public meetings that the Corps is required by law to hold in order to get feedback from residents about corps' projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/georgianne-nienaber/army-corps-of-engineers-i_b_199344.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Georgianne | last=Nienaber | title=Army Corps of Engineers in New Orleans: Buying Advice or Spin? | date=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this work, OPP received nearly $5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=OMB Watch |url=http://www.fedspending.org/fpds/fpds.php?datype=T&amp;database=fpds&amp;fiscal_year=2007&amp;maj_agency_cat=97&amp;stateCode=LA&amp;detail=-1&amp;pop_cd=LA02&amp;sum_expand=CA |title=Federal Contracts for Federal Fiscal Year : 2007, Place of Performance State : Louisiana, Place of Performance Cong.

In May 2009, an internet blogger discovered that OPP had a bar graph on its website that boasted how it helped reduce negative news coverage that plagued the Corps following Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Malbran|first=Pia|title=Outrage Over Army Corps' $4.7M PR Contract|publisher=CBS News|date=December 16, 2008|accessdate=2016-02-11|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/outrage-over-army-corps-47m-pr-contract/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group Levees.org publicly stated that corps' should not be spending taxpayer dollars trying to repair its reputation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailycomet.com/article/20090509/ARTICLES/905099949&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water supply issues==
Army involvement in works "of a civil nature," including water resources, goes back almost to the origins of the U.S. Over the years, as the Nation's needs have changed, so have the Army's Civil Works missions. Water resources controlled by the Corps of Engineers are used for navigation, hydroelectric power generation, and recreation as well as water supply. The Corps first got involved in water supply in the 1850s, when they built the Washington DC aqueduct. Today USACE reservoirs supply water to nearly 10 million people in 115 cities. In the drier parts of the Nation, water from Corps' reservoirs is also used for agriculture.

[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], and Florida have been wrangling over how to allocate water from the Chattahoochee watershed for years as metro Atlanta's population has doubled since 1980. In October 2007, the governor of Georgia, [[Sonny Perdue]], indicating an impending crisis with the water supply from Lake Lanier, declared a state of emergency and confirmed that the state would sue the US Army Corps of Engineers who administers the water supply for Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/10/18/pip.atlantadrought/ |publisher=CNN | title=Drought-stricken Georgia says it will sue over water | date=19 October 2007 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Corps acknowledged that they made a mistake in 2006 when they relied on a faulty gauge to measure [[Lake Lanier#Drought|Lake Lanier's level]] by nearly two feet. This mistake led to an overestimation of the amount of water left in the lake and the Corps accidentally released about {{convert|22|e9USgal|m3}} of water: enough to supply metro Atlanta's needs for about a month and a half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2007/10/10/wateruse_1011.html|title=Lake Lanier has three months of water storage left {{!}} ajc.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=20 October 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012104144/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2007/10/10/wateruse_1011.html|archivedate=12 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, USACE's analysis of the situation differed from the Governor's, indicating that even without rain for nine months, water supplies would still be adequate. The corps sent a letter to Perdue assessing the situation and pointing out that they are "not going to run out [of water] any time soon,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/10/20/georgia.drought/index.html |publisher=CNN | title=Georgia governor, corps differ over extent of water emergency | date=20 October 2007 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In mid-November 2007, the Corps made adjustments to its water retention policies to keep more water in the Chattahoochee watershed. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service expedited its study of an interim drought plan submitted two weeks ago by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and concluded that freshwater mussels and sturgeon in Florida and Alabama—kept alive by water from Georgia's Chattahoochee watershed under federal law—will not be jeopardized under the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/11/16/southern.drought/index.html#cnnSTCOther1 |publisher=CNN | title=Feds OK drought deal letting Georgia keep more water | date=16 November 2007 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The governors of the three states indicated that they would continue to meet and negotiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/11/16/southern.drought/index.html |publisher=CNN | title=Feds OK drought deal letting Georgia keep more water | date=16 November 2007 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wetlands jurisdiction==
One of the major responsibilities of the Corps of Engineers is administering the wetlands permitting program under Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972.  (also known as "The [[Clean Water Act]]"). This Act authorized the Secretary of the Army to issue permits for the discharge of dredged and fill material.

Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (codified in Chapter 33, Section 403 of the [[United States Code]]) gave the Corps authority over [[Navigability|navigable]] waters of the United States. As navigable waters are defined as "navigable waters of the United States are those waters that are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide and/or are presently being used, or have been used in the past, or may be susceptible for use to transport interstate or foreign commerce", the Corps has broad authority to enforce this, including licensing of bridges over navigable waters, and the maintenance of pierhead and [[bulkhead line]]s.

There is some disagreement over the extent of the Corps' reach into the wetlands, whether USACE or the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) should have jurisdiction, and how the wetlands should be regulated.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Often, it is difficult to describe the problem or make jurisdictional determinations. Many times, people are frustrated because the process isn't transparent or easy. In some cases, it appears that Corps (and EPA) regulators are searching for excuses to justify decisions in allegedly difficult circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.sws.org/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/2756008642/m/8561001604 |title=Corps of Engineers Regulatory Horror Stories? – Topic Powered by eve community |publisher=Forum.sws.org |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] has addressed environmental regulation by the Corps of Engineers three times in the last two decades. In 1985, the Supreme Court ruled 9–0 that the Clean Water Act extended to wetlands adjacent to open waters. They left open the question about wetlands not adjacent to Federal waters (United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121 (1985)) (see [[Regulatory takings#Bayview Homes|Bayview Homes]] in [[Regulatory takings]]). In 2001, the Court further decided 5–4 that the CWA does not cover areas that had filled with water (Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159 (2001)). The Corps of Engineers had claimed authority over the site by saying that migratory birds used the pond as habitat but were overruled by the Supreme Court because they were claiming powers not granted by Congress by attempting to extend its jurisdiction to ponds with no connection to navigable waters.

The Court's most recent ruling was in June 2006 in [[Rapanos v. United States]]. At issue was the way the Federal government regulates the nation's wetlands under the Clean Water Act. The law has been contentious with property owners because it requires a permit for filling and dredging wetlands that empty into navigable waters and their tributaries. Developers have long challenged the Corps' right to regulate wetlands that are not free-flowing into navigable waters. Narrowly avoiding gutting of the Clean Water Act, the Supreme Court voted 5–4 to send the case back to the lower courts for a ruling.

[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] wrote, "It is unfortunate that no opinion commands a majority of the court on precisely how to read Congress' limits on the reach of the Clean Water Act. Lower courts and regulated entities will now have to feel their way on a case-by-case basis."

Wetlands jurisdiction by the Corps of Engineers will, for the foreseeable future, remain contentious.

== Beach renourishment ==
{{main|Beach nourishment}}
The beach nourishment work by the Corps of Engineers is another area of controversy since the temporary replenishment of beach sand is extremely expensive and profitable. The reasons for [[beach nourishment]] are often misunderstood. USACE beach nourishment projects are authorized under Section 111 of the 1968 Rivers and Harbors Act (P.L. 90-483 as amended by Sec 940, WRDA '86(P.L. 99-662)) as mitigation for the damage caused by Federal navigation projects interrupting the littoral flow of beach material along shorelines. These laws require that authorized project be cost-shared; and the Federal share of costs for any one project may not exceed $2&amp;nbsp;million. Many people believe that it is only done for the benefit of well-heeled adjacent land-owners rather than for erosive or littoral purposes. One lobbying firm, Marlowe &amp; Company, charges 40 clients $40,000 each just to lobby for continued support for this controversial effort to save beaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/earth/4217981.html?page=2 |title=Beach Nourishment Problems – Taxpayer Dollars – Harmed Wildlife – Army Corps of Engineers |publisher=Popular Mechanics |date=1 October 2009 |accessdate=26 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224043238/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/earth/4217981.html?page=2 |archivedate=24 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many homeowners are disgruntled with the huge annual costs associated with this temporary fix; typical fees are $2,000 per month for a 3 bedroom beachfront condominium (such fees are most probably locally authorized since the Corps of Engineers does not assess fees because of the nature of its Congressionally approved funding). However, many coastal residents are not willing to pay the price. For example, in 2001, the Corps authorized a proposal for a $94&amp;nbsp;million project {{convert|14|mi|km|sigfig=2}} long in Nags Head, N.C. In an attempt to fund the local share of the project, local county commissioners passed a 1 percent sales tax; voters rejected it. Nags Head officials proposed a cheaper, locally funded plan. Again, voters rejected it.  "Why," asked WCU program director Rob Young, "should federal taxpayers bail out a beachfront when local residents won't?"{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

== Barrier Islands in Louisiana and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill ==
Reacting to the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], on 23 May 2010, [[Louisiana Attorney General]] [[Buddy Caldwell]] wrote a letter to Lieutenant General [[Robert L. Van Antwerp]] of the US Army Corps of Engineers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/052310caldwellletter.pdf |title=Letter to Lt. General Robert L. Van Antwerp, US Army Corps of Engineers |publisher=Louisiana Attorney General's Office |author=James D. "Buddy" Caldwell |date=23 May 2010 |accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that [[Louisiana]] has the right to dredge sand to build [[barrier islands]] to keep the [[oil spill]] from its [[wetlands]] without the approval of the Corps, as the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|10th Amendment]] to the Constitution does not grant the federal government the authority to deny a state the right to act in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0524/BP-oil-spill-pushes-Louisiana-to-desperate-massive-berm-plan |title=BP oil spill pushes Louisiana to desperate, massive 'berm' plan |publisher=Christian Science Monitor |author=Bill Sasser |date=24 May 2010 |accessdate=25 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nola.com/news/gulf-oil-spill/index.ssf/2010/05/attorney_general_buddy_caldwel.html |title=Attorney General Buddy Caldwell tells Corps of Engineers state has emergency powers to build barrier islands |publisher=Times-Picayune |author=Times-Picayune staff |date=24 May 2010 |accessdate=25 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote that if the Corps "persists in its illegal and ill-advised efforts" to prevent the state from building the barriers that he would advise [[Louisiana Governor]] [[Bobby Jindall]] to proceed with the plans and challenge the Corps in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2010/05/25/will-the-gulf-cleanup-effort-yield-a-constitutional-smackdown? |title=Will the Gulf Cleanup Effort Yield a Constitutional Smackdown? |work=Wall Street Journal |author=Ashby Jones |date=25 May 2010 |accessdate=25 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Jersey Beach Project 2017==
Despite court actions and an election where Margate NJ voters rejected a planned beach replenishment project,
in the Summer of 2017, Corp engineers began work creating dunes in Ventnor and Margate City, New Jersey. They made a very big mess, and additionally, beaches which are tested weekly in the summer for bacteria and toxins experienced unprecedented closings due to dangerous levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philly.com/philly/news/new_jersey/margate-in-uproar-about-lake-christie-may-go-to-court-to-halt-dune-work-20170731.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/top_three/crowds-protest-margate-dunes-over-public-health-concerns/article_d375fcbe-7ace-5a15-856f-326a268c4cbe.html#tncms-source=article-nav-next&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dune Problems Cause Flooding July 29, 2017.jpg|alt=Margate Dune Flooding|thumb|Trapped Contaminated Water behind Margate Dunes]]
On Aug 2, 2017, Margate Commissioners voted to go back to court in order to seek an injunction. They wanted an immediate work stoppage by the NJ DEP &amp; Army Corp of Engineers. Mistakes in building the dunes, caused substantial flooding and contaminated, standing water between the new dune and the bulkheads.

==Calls for Corps reform==
Some in Congress feel that reforms are necessary in the way the Corps operates. The Corps has been criticized as being mismanaged and lacking oversight and accountability, especially since Hurricane Katrina and the failure of the [[Flood Control Act of 1965|Army Corps built levees]] in New Orleans.

Senator [[Russ Feingold]] and Senator [[John McCain]] pushed to establish two amendments; one an independent review of Corps projects from planning and design to construction, and a second that would require that Corps projects be ranked in importance based on national priorities. In 2006, they succeeded in adding the peer review of corps projects to the [[Water Resources Development Act of 2007|Water resources development bill]] that was working its way through Congress.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

In August 2007, Senator Feingold himself tried to block passage of the bill because he felt the reforms it contained would not do enough to change the way the Corps does business.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012232742/http://feingold.senate.gov/]
{{quote|After a decade of government and independent reports calling for reforming the corps and pointing out stunning flaws in corps projects and project studies, and after the tragic failures of New Orleans levees during Hurricane Katrina, the American people deserve meaningful reform. How many more flawed projects or wasted dollars will it take before we say enough is enough?|Senator Feingold from the Senate Floor&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/25/washington/25water.html?_r=1&amp;8br&amp;oref=slogin Feingold blocks reform bill passage because it doesn't go far enough]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Calls for reform go back decades; the Corps' credibility had been challenged as early as the late 1920s. Herbert Hoover, then Secretary of Commerce, declared the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]] as “greatest disaster of peace times in our history”, which covered {{convert|26000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} in seven states. More than 700,000 people were driven from their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://140.194.76.129/publications/eng-pamphlets/ep870-1-29/entire.pdf |title=The Evolution of the Flood Control Act of 1936 |format=PDF |accessdate=26 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529061103/http://140.194.76.129/publications/eng-pamphlets/ep870-1-29/entire.pdf |archivedate=29 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent attempts at reform have been made in the 106th, 107th, 108th, and 109th Congresses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  But as Senator Feingold indicated by quoting the Times-Picayune:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;{{cquote|"Unfortunately, not everyone in Congress is interested in changing the way the corps does business. The McCain-Feingold amendments face opposition and a rival set of measures by the main authors of the water resources bill, Sens. James Inhofe and Kit Bond.... Sham reform won't do anything to restore confidence in the corps, and Congress must do better."}}

On 8 November 2007, the [[Water Resources Development Act of 2007]] became law over President Bush' veto of the bill.

In 2012, President Obama issued [[List of United States federal executive orders 13489 and above|Executive Order 13604]], Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects, to streamline and reduce the time required for review and permitting of infrastructure projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-03-28/pdf/2012-7636.pdf Executive Order 13604], Federal Register.&lt;/ref&gt; The feasibility study and environmental assessment for the deepening of [[Charleston Harbor]] was the first project to be completed under this new process.&lt;ref&gt;Segrist, Liz.

The '''Wakhi people''', or the '''Khik''',&lt;ref name="Hermann"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kreutzmann|first=Hermann|date=3 September 2003|title=Ethnic minorities and marginality in the Pamirian Knot: survival of Wakhi and Kirghiz in a harsh environment and global contexts|journal=The Geographical Journal|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|volume=169|pages=215–235}}&lt;/ref&gt; are an [[ethnic group]] living in adjacent, remote regions of [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[China]]. They are predominantly centered in Afghanistan's [[Wakhan Corridor]], the northern-most part of Pakistan's [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], the [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region|Gorno-Badakhshan]] region of Tajikistan, and the southwestern region of China's [[Xinjiang]].&lt;ref name="el"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elalliance.org/languages/iranic/wakhi/|title=Wakhi|work=Endangered Language Alliance|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are native speakers of [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]], an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] of the [[Iranian languages|Iranian branch]].

== Name ==
The Wakhi people refer to themselves as ''Khik'' and to their language as ''Khik zik''.&lt;ref name="Hermann" /&gt; The [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] ''Wakhī'', which is given to them by their neighbors, is based on ''Wux̌'', the local name of the region of [[Wakhan]], deriving from *''Waxšu'', the old name of the [[Amu Darya|Oxus River]] (Amu Darya), which is a major river formed by the junction of the [[Vakhsh River|Vakhsh]] and [[Panj River|Panj]] rivers on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

== Demographics ==
[[File:Wakhan,_Badakhshan.jpg|thumb|The [[Wakhan Corridor]] under light snow, with a Wakhi man collecting firewood.]]
[[File:Gulmit_-_GB_-_04_-_Nasr_Rahman.jpg|thumb|Wakhi musicians in [[Gulmit]], [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], [[Pakistan]].]]
Ethnic Wakhi-speakers have a total population of about 50,000–58,000.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ethnologue" /&gt; The population is divided between four countries: [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[China]]'s [[Xinjiang]]. Due to wars, heavy taxation, and oppression by the local rulers, the Wakhi people have migrated south to form the Wakhi settlements present today in northwestern Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shafiq|first1=Nadeem|title=The Wakhi Community Settlements in Northern Pakistan|journal=Journal of Political Studies|page=1|quote=The major Wakhi Community settlements in Pakistan are found in Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan areas. Their ancestors fled to these regions due to a couple of reasons including wars, heavy taxation and oppression by the local rulers and Afghan officials.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, the Wakhi people, together with the [[Sarikoli language|Sarikoli people]], are officially recognized as "[[Tajiks of Xinjiang|Tajiks]]", with ethnic-minority autonomous status. In Afghanistan, they are officially called "[[Pamiris|Pamiri]]". In Tajikistan, they are recognized by the state as "Tajiks", but self-identify as "Pamiri". In Pakistan, they refer to themselves as "Pamiri" or "[[Gojal|Gujali]]".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The Wakhi predominantly adhere to [[Nizari]] [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] [[Shia Islam]], which is regarded as their [[ethnic religion]], and are followers of the [[Aga Khan IV|Aga Khan]].&lt;ref name="Hermann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="West, Barbara 2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania|last=West|first=Barbara|publisher=Facts on File|year=2008|ISBN=0816071098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6aXloa1QsEC|title=The Kirghiz and Wakhi of Afghanistan|last=Shahrani|first=M. Nazif Mohib|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2002|ISBN=0-295-98262-4|location=Seattle|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
The Wakhi are primarily nomadic, depending on their herds of yaks and horses.&lt;ref name="KPK=PT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khyberpakhtunkhwa.gov.pk/aboutus/People-Tribles.php|title=Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: People and Tribes|work=Government of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316183221/http://www.khyberpakhtunkhwa.gov.pk/aboutus/People-Tribles.php|archivedate=16 March 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often have two residences—one for winter and one for summer. Their houses are built of stone and sod.&lt;ref name="Hermann" /&gt;

== Cultural preservation ==
Activists and researchers have been working to preserve and record the language of the Wakhi people, and have developed Wakhi orthographies using the Arabic, Cyrillic, and Latin scripts.&lt;ref name="el" /&gt;

In 1990, the Gojali Wakhis of Pakistan established the "Wakhi Tajik Cultural Association", which aimed to preserve, document, and publish their "local culture". The association introduced a script that was applied into linguistic and literary textbooks, and organized cultural festivals. [[Radio Pakistan]]'s Radio Gilgit also aired a daily Wakhi-language program named ''Bam-e Dunya'' ("Roof of the World").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqwYDQAAQBAJ|title=Disappearing Peoples?: Indigenous Groups and Ethnic Minorities in South and Central Asia|last1=Brower|first1=Barbara|last2=Johnston|first2=Barbara Rose|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7au4-y3Q-AC|title=The Iranian Languages|last=Windfuhr|first=Gernot|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=826}}&lt;/ref&gt;
