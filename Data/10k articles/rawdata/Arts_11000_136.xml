'''Artificial leather''' is a material intended to substitute for [[leather]] in fields such as [[upholstery]], clothing, footwear and [[fabrics]] and other uses where a leather-like finish is desired but the actual material is cost-prohibitive or unsuitable. Artificial leather is marketed under many names, including "leatherette", "faux leather", "vegan leather", "PU leather" and "pleather".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire Shaeffer|title=Sew Any Fabric: A Quick Reference to Fabrics from A to Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTadZIhgtUoC&amp;pg=PA37|date=10 November 2003|publisher=Krause Publications Craft|isbn=1-4402-2033-6|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
[[File:Synthetic PU leather HC1.jpg|thumb|Steps to make synthetic [[polyurethane]] leather:&lt;br&gt; 1) The base fabric&lt;br&gt; 2) A polyurethane coating is applied&lt;br&gt; 3)A color coat is added&lt;br&gt; 4) A textured finish is added&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gofar.co.kr/eng/info/info_12_2.php|title=PU Synthetic Leather||website=Gofar Synthetic Co., Ltd  |accessdate=11 May 2005  |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050511001137/http://www.gofar.co.kr/eng/info/info_12_2.php|archivedate=11 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Many different methods for the manufacture of imitation leathers have been developed.

One of the earliest was ''[[Presstoff]]''. Invented in 19th century Germany, it is made of specially layered and treated paper pulp. It gained its widest use in Germany during the Second World War in place of leather, which under wartime conditions was rationed. ''Presstoff'' could be used in almost every application normally filled by leather, excepting items like footwear that were repeatedly subjected to flex wear or moisture. Under these conditions ''Presstoff'' tends to delaminate and lose cohesion.

''Poromerics'' are made from a plastic coating (usually a [[polyurethane]]) on a fibrous base layer (typically a [[polyester]]). The term poromeric was coined by [[DuPont]] as a derivative of the terms ''porous'' and ''polymeric''. The first poromeric material was DuPont's Corfam, introduced in 1963 at the Chicago Shoe Show. Corfam was the centerpiece of the DuPont pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] in New York City. After spending millions of dollars marketing the product to shoe manufacturers, DuPont withdrew Corfam from the market in 1971 and sold the rights to a company in [[Poland]].

''Leatherette'' is also made by covering a fabric base with a plastic. The fabric can be made of natural or synthetic fiber which is then covered with a soft [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] layer. Leatherette is used in [[bookbinding]] and was common on the casings of 20th century cameras.

Cork leather is a natural-fiber alternative made from the bark of [[cork oak]] trees that has been compressed, similar to ''Presstoff''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://goblackwood.co.uk/cork-leather/|title=Cork Leather – The Best Alternative to Animal Leather?|last=Oskar|first=Zieba|date=5 July 2017|work=Blackwood Blog|access-date=3 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803212739/https://goblackwood.co.uk/cork-leather/|archive-date=3 August 2017|dead-url=yes|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fermentation method of making [[collagen]], the main chemical in real leather, is under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/09/modern-meadow-and-evonik-are-brewing-leather-in-a-lab.html|title=This leather is made in a lab, not from livestock|last=Kolodny|first=Lora|date=2018-03-09|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clothing and fabric uses==
[[File:HM Queen Paola, Princess of Belgium.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Paola of Belgium]] wearing artificial leather]]
Artificial leathers are often used in clothing fabrics, furniture upholstery, and automotive uses.&lt;ref name=faux&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mitchellfauxleathers.com/Default/ViewPoint/Read/faux-leather-viewpoint/2014/04/07/what-is-faux-leather|title=What is Faux Leather?|first=Jim|last=Blesius|date=April 7, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One disadvantage of plastic-coated artificial leather is that it is not porous and does not allow air to pass through; thus, sweat can accumulate if it is used for clothing, car seat coverings, etc. One of its primary advantages, especially in cars, is that it requires little maintenance in comparison to leather, and does not crack or fade easily.&lt;ref name=faux/&gt;

The '''Atlas Fountain''' stands in the grounds of [[Castle Howard]], [[North Yorkshire]], England.  It has been designated a Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[listed building]] and is now recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]], maintained by [[Historic England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1148973|desc=Atlas Fountain and Pond|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Atlas Fountain and pond dates from 1850. It was exhibited at [[The Great Exhibition]] prior to installation.&lt;ref&gt;Castle Howard Guidebook, G. Howard. 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed by [[William Andrews Nesfield]] and the sculpted figures were carved in Portland stone by [[John Thomas (sculptor)|John Thomas]] who was paid £1183 10s 3d (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1183.5|1853|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} for his work. The figures were transported by rail from London to [[Castle Howard railway station]].

The tazza, pedestals, shells and basin were made by local craftsmen. The water engineering was completed by James Easton,&lt;ref&gt;English Gardens and Landscapes, Christopher Hussey. 1700–1750, Country Life. 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; taking water from a stream in [[Coneysthorpe]] and using a steam engine to pump it uphill to the Ray Wood reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Fountains and Water Features: From Ancient Springs to Modern Marvels. Rosalind Hopwood, Frances Lincoln Ltd, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The fountain was turned on for the first time in October 1853.

The fountain was overhauled in 1983 and again by The Earth Stone and Lime in 2012.

==Description==

A large globe of bronze dominates the fountain supported on the shoulders of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]. Four recumbent [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]] blow water through shells over [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] kneeling on a pedestal in the central tazza. Other jets fill the lower scallop shell basins, which overflow into the central basin producing a dramatic cascade of white water.

The fountain is fed from the half-million gallon Ray Wood reservoir, to the east of the main house. Gravity feeds water into a chamber beneath the pond basin where pipes direct it to the main outlets in the Triton's shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castlehoward.co.uk/DB/Latest-News/Atlas-Fountain-Restoration.html |title=Atlas Fountain Restoration :: Castle Howard – Historic Estate, House and Gardens, Yorkshire |publisher=Castle Howard |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=1 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091434/http://www.castlehoward.co.uk/DB/Latest-News/Atlas-Fountain-Restoration.html |archivedate=7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pond is approximately {{convert|27|m|ft}} in diameter.

'''''Black Like Me''''', first published in [[1960 in literature|1961]], is a nonfiction book by [[White people|white]] journalist [[John Howard Griffin]] recounting his journey in the [[Deep South]] of the United States, at a time when [[African-Americans]] lived under [[Racial_segregation#United_States|racial segregation]]. Griffin was a native of [[Dallas, Texas]], who had his skin temporarily darkened to pass as a black man. He traveled for six weeks throughout the [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] states of [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to explore life from the other side of the [[color line (civil rights issue)|color line]]. ''[[Sepia (magazine)|Sepia Magazine]]'' financed the project in exchange for the right to print the account first as a series of articles.

Griffin kept a journal of his experiences; the 188-page diary was the genesis of the book. When he started his project in 1959, race relations in America were particularly strained. The title of the book is taken from the last line of the [[Langston Hughes]] poem "Dream Variations".

In 1964, a film version of ''[[Black Like Me (film)|Black Like Me]],'' starring [[James Whitmore]], was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Black Like Me (1964) James Whitmore Stars in Book's Adaptation|first=Bosley|last=Crowther|date=May 21, 1964|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0CE5DD1F3AE13ABC4951DFB366838F679EDE}}&lt;/ref&gt; A generation later, Robert Bonazzi published a biographical book about Griffin, these events, and his life: ''Man in the Mirror: John Howard Griffin and the Story of Black Like Me'' (1997).

==Account of the trip==
In late 1959, John Howard Griffin went to a friend's house in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].  Once there, under the care of a dermatologist, Griffin underwent a regimen of large oral doses of the anti-[[vitiligo]] drug [[methoxsalen]], and spending up to fifteen hours daily under an ultraviolet lamp.&lt;ref name="snopes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/freakish/griffin.asp|title=Death of John Howard Griffin : snopes.com|author=snopes|date=18 October 2015|work=Snopes}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he could pass as an African American, Griffin began a six-week journey in the South. Don Rutledge traveled with him, documenting the experience with photos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanleyleary.com/blacklikeme/ "Black Like Me"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606064457/http://www.stanleyleary.com/blacklikeme/ |date=June 6, 2015 }}, Stanley Leary&lt;/ref&gt; 

During his trip, Griffin abided by the rule that he would not change his name or alter his identity; if asked who he was or what he was doing, he would tell the truth.&lt;ref&gt;"I decided not to change my name or identity. ... If asked who I was or what I was doing, I would answer truthfully." (page 4) ''Black Like Me'', Signet &amp; New American Library, a division of Penguin Group publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning, he decided to talk as little as possible&lt;ref&gt;"I had made it a rule to talk as little as possible at first." (page 23)&lt;/ref&gt; to ease his transition into the social milieu of southern U.S. blacks. He became accustomed everywhere to the "hate stare" received from whites.

After he disguised himself, many people who knew Griffin as a white man did not recognize him. Sterling Williams, a black shoeshine man in the [[French Quarter]] whom Griffin regarded as a casual friend, did not recognize him. Because Griffin wanted assistance in entering into the black community, he decided to tell Sterling about his identity and project. He first hinted that he wore the same unusual shoes as somebody else,&lt;ref&gt;He looked up without a hint of recognition. ... He had shined them many times and I felt he should certainly recognize them.(page 26)&lt;/ref&gt; but Sterling still did not recognize him until Griffin told him.

In New Orleans, a black counterman at a small restaurant chatted with Griffin about the difficulties of finding a place to go to the bathroom, as facilities were segregated and blacks were prohibited from many. He turned a question about a Catholic church into a joke about "spending much of your time praying for a place to piss".

On a bus trip, Griffin began to give his seat to a white woman, but disapproving looks from black passengers stopped him. He thought he had a momentary breakthrough with the woman, but she insulted him and began talking with other white passengers about how impudent the blacks were becoming.

==Reaction==
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
After his book was published, Griffin received many letters of support. He said they helped him understand the experience.&lt;ref&gt;"There were six thousand letters to date and only nine of them abusive." (page 184)&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffin became a national celebrity for a time. In a 1975 essay included in later editions of the book, he recounted encountering hostility and threats to him and his family in his hometown of [[Mansfield, Texas]]. He moved to Mexico for a number of years for safety.&lt;ref name=bbc20091025&gt;{{citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8318628.stm | title = Exposing the colour of prejudice | author = Kevin Connolly | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WP20070317&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/16/AR2007031602173.html | title = John Howard Griffin Took Race All the Way to the Finish | author = Jonathan Yardley | date = March 17, 2007 | publisher = [[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precedent==
Journalist [[Ray Sprigle]] had undertaken a similar project more than a decade earlier. In 1948, Sprigle disguised himself as a black man and travelled in the [[Deep South]] with [[John Wesley Dobbs]], a guide from the [[NAACP]]. Sprigle wrote a series of articles under the title, "I Was a Negro in the South for 30 Days," which was published in many newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Sprigle's secret journey | journal = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | author = Bill Steigerwald|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sprigle/Sprigleintroduction.asp|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The articles formed the basis of Sprigle's 1949 book ''[[In the Land of Jim Crow]]''.

{{Byzantine culture}}
'''Byzantine literature''' is the [[Greek literature]] of the [[Middle Ages]], whether written in the territory of the [[Byzantine Empire]] or outside its borders.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica - "Greek literature: Byzantine literature"&lt;/ref&gt; It forms the second period in the history of Greek literature after [[Ancient Greek literature]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Although ''popular'' Byzantine literature and early [[Modern Greek literature]] both began in the 11th century, the two are indistinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;"The Modern Greek language in its relation to Ancient Greek", [[E. M. Geldart]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Many of the classical Greek genres, such as drama and choral lyric poetry, had been obsolete by late antiquity, and all medieval literature in the [[Greek language]] was written in an archaizing style, which imitated the writers of [[ancient Greece]]. This practice was perpetuated by a long-established system of Greek education where [[rhetoric]] was a leading subject.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; A typical product of this Byzantine education was the Greek [[Church Fathers]], who shared the literary values of their pagan contemporaries. Consequently, the vast Christian literature of the 3rd to 6th centuries established a synthesis of [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] and [[Christian]] thought. As a result, Byzantine literature was largely written in a style of [[Atticism|Atticistic]] Greek, far removed from the popular [[Medieval Greek]] that was spoken by all classes of Byzantine society in their everyday lives. In addition, this literary style was also removed from the [[Koine Greek]] language of the [[New Testament]], reaching back to [[Homer]] and the writers of ancient [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

In this manner, the culture of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was marked for over 1000 years by a [[diglossia|diglossy]] between two different forms of the same language, which were used for different purposes.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; However, the relations between the "high" and "low" forms of Greek changed over the centuries. The prestige of the Attic literature remained undiminished until the 7th century AD, but in the following two centuries when the existence of the Byzantine Empire was threatened, city life and education declined, and along with them the use of the classicizing language and style. The political recovery of the 9th century instigated a literary revival, in which a conscious attempt was made to recreate the Hellenic-Christian literary culture of late antiquity.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Simple or popular Greek was avoided in literary use and many of the early saints' lives were rewritten in an archaizing style. By the 12th century the cultural confidence of the [[Byzantine Greeks]] led them to develop new literary genres, such as romantic fiction, in which adventure and love are the main elements.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Satire made occasional use of elements from spoken Greek. The period from the [[Fourth Crusade]] to the [[Fall of Constantinople]] saw a vigorous revival of imitative classicizing literature, as the Greeks sought to assert their cultural superiority over the militarily more powerful West.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; At the same time there was the beginning of a flourishing literature in an approximation to the vernacular [[Modern Greek]]. However the vernacular literature was limited to poetic romances and popular devotional writing. All serious literature continued to make use of the archaizing language of learned Greek tradition.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

Byzantine literature has two sources: [[ancient Greece|Classical Greek]] and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Each of those sources provided a series of models and references for the Byzantine writer and his readers. In occasion, both sources were referred to side by side, for example when emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexius Comnenus]] justified his actions of seizing church property to pay his soldiers by referring to the earlier examples of [[Pericles]] and the biblical king [[King David|David]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

=== Greek ===
The oldest of these three civilizations is the Greek, centered not in [[Athens]] but in [[Alexandria]] and Hellenistic civilization. Alexandria through this period is the center of both Atticizing scholarship and of Graeco-Judaic social life, looking towards Athens as well as towards [[Jerusalem]]. This intellectual dualism between the culture of scholars and that of the people permeates the Byzantine period. Even Hellenistic literature exhibits two distinct tendencies, one rationalistic and scholarly, the other romantic and popular: the former originated in the schools of the Alexandrian [[Sophism|sophists]] and culminated in the rhetorical romance, the latter rooted in the idyllic tendency of [[Theocritus]] and culminated in the idyllic novel. Both tendencies persisted in Byzantium, but the first, as the one officially recognized, retained predominance and was not driven from the field until the fall of the empire. The reactionary linguistic movement known as [[Atticism]] supported and enforced this scholarly tendency. Atticism prevailed from the 2nd century BC onward, controlling all subsequent Greek culture, so that the living form of the Greek language was obscured and only occasionally found expression in private documents and popular literature.

=== Roman ===
Alexandria, the intellectual center, is balanced by Rome, the center of government. It is as a Roman Empire that the Byzantine state first entered history; its citizens were known as Romans (''Rhomaioi''), its capital as New Rome (Constantinople). Its laws were Roman; so were its government, its army, and its official class, and at first also its language and its private and public life. The organization of the state was very similar to that of the Roman imperial period, including its hierarchy and bureaucratic elite.

=== Christian ===
It was in Alexandria that Graeco-Oriental Christianity had its birth. There the [[Septuagint]] translation had been made; there that that fusion of Greek philosophy and Jewish religion took place which culminated in [[Philo]]; there flourished the mystic speculative [[Neoplatonism]] associated with [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry of Tyros|Porphyry]]. At Alexandria the great Greek ecclesiastical writers worked alongside pagan rhetoricians and philosophers; several were born here, e.g. [[Origen]], [[Athanasius]], and his opponent [[Arius]], also [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]] and [[Synesius]]. On Egyptian soil [[monasticism]] began and thrived. After Alexandria, [[Antioch]] held great prestige, where a school of Christian commentators flourished under [[St. John Chrysostom]] and where later arose the Christian universal chronicles. In surrounding Syria, we find the germs of Greek ecclesiastical poetry, while from neighboring [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] came [[St. John of Damascus]], one of the [[Church Fathers|Greek Fathers]].

=== Oriental ===
Greek Christianity had of necessity a pronounced Oriental character; [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid Syria]] are the real birthplaces of the Graeco-Oriental church and Byzantine civilization in general. Egypt and Syria, with [[Asia Minor]], became for the autochthonous Greek civilization a place where hundreds of flourishing cities sprang into existence, where energies confined or crippled in the impoverished homeland found release; not only did these cities surpass in material wealth the mother country, but soon also cultivated the highest goods of the intellect ([[Karl Krumbacher|Krumbacher]]). Under such circumstances it is not strange that about nine-tenths of all the Byzantine authors of the first eight centuries were natives of Egypt, Syria, Palestine, and Asia Minor.

== Genres ==
The following account classifies Byzantine literature into five groups. The first three include representatives of those kinds of literature which continued the ancient traditions: historians and [[chronicle]]rs, encyclopedists and essayists, and writers of secular poetry. The other two include new literary genres, ecclesiastical and theological literature, and popular poetry.

=== Historians and annalists ===
{{further information|Greek historiography|List of Greek historiographers}}
The two groups of secular prose literature show clearly the dual character of Byzantine intellectual life in its social, religious, and linguistic aspects. From this point of view historical and annalistic literature supplement each other; the former is aristocratic and secular, the latter ecclesiastical and monastic; the former is classical, the latter popular. The works of the historians belong to scholarly literature, those of the annalists (or chroniclers) to the literature of the people. The former are carefully elaborated, the latter give only raw material, the former confine themselves to the description of the present and the most recent past, and thus have rather the character of contemporary records; the latter cover the whole history of the world as known to the Middle Ages. The former are therefore the more valuable for political history; the latter for the history of civilization.

==== Historians ====
[[File:A Thracesian woman kills a Varangian.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An illumination of a scene from the ''[[Skylitzes Chronicle]]'', depicting a [[Thracesian Theme|Thracesian]] woman killing a Varangian who tried to rape her, whereupon his comrades praised her and gave her his possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Wortley|editor-first=John|title=John Skylitzes: A Synopsis of Byzantine History, 811-1057|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-76705-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGE8Xq832A0C|page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Classical literary tradition set the standard for Byzantine historians in their grasp of the aims of history, the manner of handling their subjects, and in style of composition. Their works are thoroughly concrete and objective in character, without passion, and even without enthusiasm. Ardent patriotism and personal convictions are rarely evident. They are diplomatic historians, expert in the use of historical sources and in the polished tact called for by their social position; they are not cIoset-scholars, ignorant of the world, but men who stood out in public life: jurists like [[Procopius]], [[Agathias]], [[Evagrius Scholasticus|Evagrius]], [[Michael Attaliates]], statesmen like [[John Kinnamos|Joannes Cinnamus]], [[Nicetas Acominatus]], [[Georgius Pachymeres]], [[Laonicus Chalcondyles]]; generals and diplomats like [[Nicephorus Bryennius the Younger]], [[George Acropolites]], [[Georgius Phrantzes]]; and even crowned heads, like [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]], [[Anna Comnena]], [[John VI Cantacuzene]], and others. The Byzantine historians thus represent not only the social but also the intellectual flower of their time, resembling in this their Greek predecessors, [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Xenophon]], and [[Polybius]], who became their guides and models. Sometimes a Byzantine chooses a classic writer to imitate in method and style. The majority, however, took as models several authors, a custom which gave rise to a peculiar mosaic style, quite characteristic of the Byzantines. While often the result of a real community of feeling, it effectively prevented development of an individual style.

Had such a preëminent historian as Procopius modeled his work after Polybius rather than Thucydides, Byzantine histories may have followed a natural continuity in style and method with the Hellenic era. The Hellenistic "Atticists" however had impressed their tastes thoroughly on later centuries, celebrating the style of the Athenian golden age. It is no accident that military characters like Nicephorus Bryennius (11th and 12th centuries) and Joannes Cinnamus (12th century) emulated Xenophon in the precision of their diction, or that a philosopher like Nicephorus Gregoras (13th century) took [[Plato]] as his model. On the other hand, it is doubtless due to chance that writers trained in theology like [[Leo Diaconus]] and Georgius Pachymeres chose to emulate [[Homer]]ic turns. On the whole it is in the later historians that the dualism of Byzantine civilization—ecclesiastico-political matter in classical form—becomes most apparent.

While Byzantine historians were mostly dependent on foreign models, and seem to form a continuous series in which each succeeds the last, they do not blend into a uniform whole. Most of the historians come in either the period embracing the 6th and 7th centuries during the reigns of the East-Roman emperors, or that extending from the 11th to the 15th century under the [[Comneni]] and the [[Palaeologi]]. At its zenith under the [[Byzantine Empire#Golden era|Macedonian dynasty]] (the 9th and 10th centuries) the Byzantine world produced great heroes, but no great historians, excepting the solitary figure of the Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]].

The first period is dominated by Procopius because of his subject matter and his literary importance. Typically Byzantine, his ''[[Anekdota]]'' depreciates Emperor [[Justinian I]] as emphatically as his ''[[Peri Ktismaton]]'' apotheosizes him. In literature and history though, he follows classical models, as is evident in the precision and lucidity of his narrative acquired from Thucydides, and in the reliability of his information, qualities of special merit in the historian. Procopius and to a great degree his successor Agathias remain the models of descriptive style as late as the 11th century. Procopius is the first representative of the ornate Byzantine style in literature and in this is surpassed only by [[Theophylaktos Simokattes]] in the 7th century. Despite their unclassical form, however, they approach the ancients in their freedom from ecclesiastical and dogmatic tendencies.

Between the historical writings of the first period and those of the second, there is an isolated series of works which in matter and form offer a strong contrast to both the aforesaid groups. These are the works under the name of the Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] (10th century), dealing respectively with the administration of the empire, its political division, and the ceremonies of the Byzantine Court. They treat of the internal conditions of the empire, and the first and third are distinguished by their use of a popular tongue. The first is an important source of ethnological information, while the last is an interesting contribution to the history of civilization.

The second group of historians present a classical eclecticism veiling an unclassical partisanship and theological fanaticism. Revelling in classical forms, the historians of the period of the Comneni and Palaeologi were devoid of the classical spirit. While many had stronger, more sympathetic personalities than the school of Procopius, the very vigor of these individuals and their close ties to the imperial government served to hamper their objectivity, producing subjective, partisan works. Thus the "[[Alexiad]]", the pedantic work of Princess [[Anna Comnena]], glorifies her father [[Alexius I Comnenus|Alexius]] and the imperial reorganization he began; the historical work of her husband, Nicephorus Bryennius, describes the internal conflicts that accompanied the rise of the Comneni in the form of a family chronicle (late 11th century); John VI Cantacuzene self-complacently narrates his own achievements (14th century). This group exhibits striking antitheses both personal and objective. Beside Cinnamus, who honestly hated everything Western, stand the broad-minded [[Nicetas Acominatus]] (12th century) and the conciliatory but dignified [[Georgius Acropolites]] (13th century); beside the theological polemicist Pachymeres (13th century), stands the man of the world, Nicephorus Gregoras (14th century), well versed in philosophy and the classics. Though subjective in matters of internal Byzantine history, these and others of this period are trustworthy in their accounts of external events, and especially valuable as sources for the first appearance of the Slavs and Turks.

==== Chroniclers ====
[[Image:Musee du Moyen Age A09.JPG|thumb|right|A Byzantine [[Gospel]] of the 13th century, it shows the increasing trend towards the use of [[Ivory]] as an artistic tool.]]
Unlike the historical works, Byzantine chronicles were intended for the general public; hence the difference in their origin, development, and diffusion, as well as in their character, method, and style. While the roots of the chronicle have not yet been satisfactorily traced, their comparatively late appearance (6th century) and total remove from Hellenistic tradition places their origins as fairly recent. The chronicle literature is originally foreign to Greek civilization, the first of which was composed by uneducated Syrians. Its presumable prototype, the "Chronography" of [[Sextus Julius Africanus]], points to an Oriental Christian source. Unconnected with persons of distinction and out of touch with the great world, it follows models bound within its own narrow sphere. The 9th century saw the zenith of the Byzantine chronicle, during the nadir of historical literature. Afterwards it declines abruptly; the lesser chroniclers, seen as late as the 12th century, draw partly from contemporary and partly, though rarely, from earlier historians. In the Palaeologi period no chroniclers of note appear.

Not only important sources for the history of Byzantine civilization, the chronicles themselves contributed to the spread of civilization, passing Byzantine culture to the arriving Slavic, [[Hungarian people|Magyar]], and [[Turkic peoples]]. Depicting as they did what lay within the popular consciousness—events wonderful and dreadful painted in glaring colours and interpreted in a Christian sense—their influence was considerable. The method of handling materials is primitive—beneath each section lies some older source only slightly modified, so that the whole resembles a patchwork of materials rather than the ingenious mosaic of the historians. They are a rich store for comparative linguistics, as their diction is purely the popular tongue, bespeaking the poor education of author and audience.

Representative Byzantine chronicles are the three of [[Joannes Malalas]], [[Theophanes Confessor]], and [[Joannes Zonaras]], respectively. The first is the earliest Christian Byzantine monastic chronicle, composed in the Antioch in the 6th century by a hellenized Syrian and [[Monophysite]] theologian. Originally a city chronicle, it was expanded into a world-chronicle. It is a popular historical work, full of historical and chronological errors, and the first monument of a purely popular Hellenistic civilization. The chief source for most of the later chroniclers as well as for a few church historians, it is also the earliest popular history translated into [[Old Church Slavonic]] (c. early 10th century). Superior in substance and form, and more properly historical, is the ''Chronicle'' of Theophanes, a 9th-century monk of Asia Minor, and in its turn a model for later chronicles. It contains much valuable information from lost sources, and its importance for the Western world is due to the fact that by the end of the 9th century it had to be translated into Latin. A third guide-post in the history of Byzantine chronicles is the 12th-century ''Universal Chronicle'' of [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]]. It reflects somewhat the atmosphere of the Comneni renaissance; not only is the narrative better than that of Theophanes, but many passages from ancient writers are worked into the text. It was translated not only into Slavic and Latin, but into [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] as well (16th century).

=== Encyclopedists and essayists ===
[[Image:Suda.jpg|thumb|right|A page from a 16th-century edition of the vast Byzantine [[encyclopaedia]], the ''[[Suda]]''.]]
The spirit of antiquarian scholarship awoke in Byzantium earlier than in the West, but begun by lay theologians, not laymen. For this reason it always had a scholastic flavor; the Byzantine [[Humanism|humanistic]] spirit savored of antiquity and the Middle Ages in equal proportion. Primarily directed to the systematic collection and sifting of [[manuscript]]s, a pronounced interest in the literature of Greek antiquity first manifested at Constantinople in the late 9th century. With the 12th century begins the period of original works imitating antique models, a revival of the [[Alexandrian essay]] and [[rhetoric]]al literature, a number of writers showing vigorous originality. Quite isolated between the two periods stands [[Michael Psellus]] (11th century), a universal genius who bridges the periods. While the humanism of the 9th and 10th centuries retained a theological coloring and a hostile attitude towards the West, the 12th to the 14th century saw several writers seeking to break away from orthodox classicism to attain a true humanism, becoming the forerunners of the [[Italian Renaissance]].

The new spirit first found expression in an academy founded for classical studies at Constantinople in 863. About the same time the broadly trained and energetic [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], patriarch of the city and the greatest statesman of the Greek Church (820-897), enthusiastically collected forgotten manuscripts, revived forgotten works of antiquity, and re-discovered lost works; his attention was chiefly directed to prose works, indicative of his pragmatism. Photius made selections or excerpts from all the works he discovered, forming the beginning of his celebrated ''Bibliotheca'' ("Library"), which while dry and schematic remains the most valuable literary compendium of the Middle Ages, containing trustworthy summaries of many ancient works now lost, together with good characterizations and analyses such as those of [[Lucian]] and [[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]]. This encyclopedic activity was more assiduously pursued in the 10th century, particularly in the systematic collecting of materials associated with Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]]. Scholars also formed great compilations, arranged by subject, on the basis of older sources. Among these was a now-fragmentary encyclopedia of political science containing extracts from the classical, Alexandrian, and Roman Byzantine periods. These, with the collection of ancient epigrams known as the ''[[Anthologia Palatina]]'' and the scientific dictionary known as the ''[[Suda]]'', make the 10th century that of the encyclopedias.

A typical representative of the period appears in the following century in the person of the greatest encyclopedist of Byzantine literature, Michael Psellus. Standing between the Middle Ages and modern times, he is a jurist and a man of the world with a mind both receptive and productive. Unlike Photius, who was more concerned with individual philosophic arguments, Psellus does not undervalue the old philosophers, and is himself of a philosophic temperament. He was the first of his intellectual circle to raise the philosophy of Plato above that of Aristotle and to teach philosophy as a professor. Surpassing Photius in intellect and wit, he lacks that scholar's dignity and solidity of character. A restless brilliance characterized his life and literary activity. At first a lawyer, then a professor; now a monk, now a court official; he ended his career the prime minister. He was equally adroit and many-sided in his literary work; in harmony with the polished, pliant nature of the courtier is his elegant [[Platonism|Platonic]] style of his letters and speeches. His extensive correspondence furnishes endless material illustrating his personal and literary character. The ennobling influence of his Attic models mark his speeches and especially his funerary orations; that delivered on the death of his mother shows deep sensibility. Psellus had more of a poetic temperament than Photius, as several of his poems show, though they owe more to satirical fancy and occasion than to deep poetic feeling. Though Psellus exhibits more formal skill than creativity, his endowments shone forth in a time particularly backward in aesthetic culture. The intellectual freedom of the great scholars (''[[polyhistor]]es''), both ecclesiastical and secular, of the following centuries would be inconceivable without the triumph of Psellus over Byzantine [[scholasticism]].
[[Image:Horologe1.jpg|thumb|left|A Modern copy of a Byzantine [[Horologion]], showing the daily cycle of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].]]
While among his successors—such as [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]] and [[Hyrtakenos]]—are natures as corrupt as Psellus' own, the majority are marked by their rectitude of intention, sincerity of feeling, and their beneficently broad culture. Among these great intellects and strong characters of the 12th century several theologians are especially conspicuous, for example [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], [[Michael Italicus]], and [[Michael Acominatus]]; in the 13th and 14th centuries several secular scholars, like [[Maximus Planudes]], [[Theodore Metochites|Theodorus Metochites]], and above all, [[Nicephorus Gregoras]].

The three theologians may best be judged by their letters and minor occasional writings. Eustathius seems to be the most important, writing learned commentary on Homer and [[Pindar]] alongside original works that are candid, courageous, and controversial, intent upon the correction of every evil. In one of his works he attacks the corruption and intellectual stagnation of the monastic life of that day; in another polemic, he assails the hypocrisy and sham holiness of his time; in a third he denounces the conceit and arrogance of the Byzantine priests.

The rhetorician Michael Italicus, later a bishop, attacks the chief weakness of Byzantine literature, external imitation; this he did on receiving a work by a patriarch, which was simply a disorderly collection of fragments from other writers, so poorly put together that the sources were immediately recognizable.

The pupil and friend of Eustathius, Michael Acominatus (12th and 13th centuries) Archbishop of Athens and brother of the historian [[Nicetas Acominatus]]. His inaugural address, delivered on the Acropolis, exhibits both profound classical scholarship and high enthusiasm despite the material and spiritual decay of his times. These pitiful conditions moved him to compose an elegy, famous because unique, on the decay of Athens, a sort of poetical and antiquarian apostrophe to fallen greatness. [[Gregorovius]] compared the inaugural address with [[Gregory the Great]]'s to the Romans, and this with the lament of Bishop [[Hildebert of Tours]] on the demolition of Rome by the [[Normans]] (1106). His funeral orations over Eustathius (1195) and his brother Nicetas, though wordier and rhetorical, still evinced a noble disposition and deep feeling. Michael, like his brother, remained a fanatical opponent of the Latins. They had driven him into exile at [[Ceos]], whence he addressed many letters to his friends illustrating his character. Stylistically influenced by Eustathius, his otherwise classical diction sounded an ecclesiastical note.

With [[Theodore Metochites]] and [[Maximus Planudes|Maximos Planoudes]] we come to the universal scholars (polyhistores) of the time of the Palaeologi. The former displays his humanism in his use of hexameter, the latter in his knowledge of the Latin; both of which are otherwise unknown in Byzantium, and foreboding a broader grasp of antiquity. Both men show a fine sense of poetry, especially of nature poetry. Metochites composed meditations on the beauty of the sea; Planudes was the author of a long poetic idyll, a genre uncultivated by Byzantine scholars. While Metochites was a thinker and poet, Planudes was chiefly an imitator and compiler. Metochites was more speculative, as his collection of philosophical and historical miscellanies show; Planudes was more precise, as his preference for mathematics proves. Contemporary progress in philosophy was at a point where Metochites could openly attack Aristotle. He deals more frankly with political questions, such as his comparison of democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy. While his breadth of interest was large, Metochites's culture rests wholly on a Greek basis, though Planudes, by his translations from the Latin ([[Cato the Elder|Cato]], [[Ovid]], [[Cicero]], [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], and [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]), vastly enlarged the Eastern intellectual horizon.

This inclination toward the West is most noticeable in Nicephorus Gregoras, the great pupil of Metochites. His project for a reform of the calendar ranks him among the modern intellects of his time, as will be proven if ever his numerous works in every domain of intellectual activity are brought to light. His letters, especially, promise a rich harvest. His method of exposition is based on that of Plato, whom he also imitated in his ecclesiastico-political discussions, e.g. in his dialogue "Florentius, or Concerning Wisdom." These disputations with [[Barlaam of Calabria|Barlaam]] dealt with the question of church union, in which Gregoras took the Unionist part. This brought him bitter hostility and the loss of his teaching living; he had been occupied chiefly with the exact sciences, whereby he had already earned the hatred of orthodox Byzantines.

While the Byzantine essayists and encyclopedists stood wholly under the influence of ancient rhetoric, still they embodied in the traditional forms their own characteristic knowledge, and thereby lent it a new charm.

=== Secular poetry ===
Poetry likewise had its prototypes, each genre tracing its origins to an ancient progenitor. Unlike the prose, these new genres do not follow from the classical Attic period, for the Byzantines wrote neither Iyrics nor dramas, imitating neither Pindar nor Sophocles. Imitating the literature of the Alexandrian period, they wrote romances, [[panegyric]]s, [[epigram]]s, [[satire]]s, and didactic and hortatory poetry, following the models of [[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]] and [[Achilles Tatius]], [[Asclepiades of Samos|Asclepiades]] and [[Posidippus]], Lucian and [[Longus]]. Didactic poetry looks to an earlier prototype by [[Isocrates]]' ''Ad Demonicum''. The poetic temperament of the Byzantines is thus akin to that of the Alexandrian writers. Only one new type evolved independently by the Byzantines—the begging-poem. The six genres are not contemporaneous: the epigram and the panegyric developed first (6th and 7th centuries), then, at long intervals, satire, next didactic and begging poetry, finally the romance. Only after the 12th century, the period of decay, do they appear side by side. The epigram was the only form of secular poetry that had an independent revival in Byzantine literature, and this at the very time when ecclesiastical poetry also reached its highest perfection, in the 6th and 7th centuries. This age is therefore the most flourishing period of Byzantine scholarly poetry; its decline in the 12th century is contemporary with the rise of popular poetry. The chief kinds of poetry during the period of the decline (11th to 13th century) were satire and parody, didactic and hortatory poetry, the begging-poem, and the erotic romance. In form this literature is characterized by its extensive use of the popular forms of speech and verse, the latter being the "political" verse (Greek ἡμαξευμένοι στίχοι, called "that abominable make-believe of a metre" by [[Charles Peter Mason]] in [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]'s ''Dictionary''), an iambic verse of fifteen syllables, still the standard verse of modern Greek popular poetry &lt;!-- as of 1913 --&gt;. In content, however, all this literature continues to bear the imprint of Byzantine erudition.

==== Epigram ====
The epigram suited the Byzantine taste for the ornamental and for intellectual ingenuity. It corresponded exactly to the concept of the minor arts that attained high development in the Byzantine period. Making no lofty demands on the imagination of the author, its chief difficulty lay rather in technique and the attainment of the utmost possible pregnancy of phrase. Two groups may be distinguished among the Byzantine epigrammatists: one pagan and humanistic, the other Christian. The former is represented chiefly by [[Agathias]] (6th century) and [[Christophorus of Mitylene]] (11th century), the latter by the ecclesiastics [[Georgius Pisides]] (7th century) and [[Theodorus Studites]] (9th century). Between the two groups, in point of time as well as in character, stands [[Joannes Geometres]] (10th century).

The chief phases in the development of the Byzantine epigram are most evident in the works of these three. Agathias, who has already been mentioned among the historians, as an epigrammatist, has the peculiarities of the school of the semi-Byzantine Egyptian [[Nonnus]] (about AD 400). He wrote in an affected and turgid style, in the classical form of the [[hexameter]]; he abounds, however, in brilliant ideas, and in his skillful imitation of the ancients, particularly in his erotic pieces, he surpasses most of the epigrammatists of the imperial period. Agathias also prepared a collection of epigrams, partly his own and partly by other writers, some of which afterwards passed into the ''[[Anthologia Palatina]]'' and have thus been preserved. The abbot Theodorus Studites is in every respect the opposite of Agathias, a pious man of deep earnestness, with a fine power of observation in nature and life, full of sentiment, warmth, and simplicity of expression, free from servile imitation of the ancients, though influenced by Nonnus. While touching on the most varied things and situations, his epigrams on the life and personnel of his monastery offer special interest for the history of civilization. Joannes Geometres combines aspects of the previous two. During the course of his life he filled both secular and ecclesiastical offices and his poetry had a universal character; of a deeply religious temper, still he appreciated the greatness of the ancient Greeks. Alongside epigrams on ancient poets, philosophers, rhetoricians, and historians stand others on famous Church Fathers, poets, and saints. Poetically, the epigrams on contemporary and secular topics are superior to those on religious and classic subjects. His best works depict historical events and situations he himself experienced, and reflect his own spiritual moods (Krumbacher).
[[File:Porphyrogenetus.jpg|right|thumb|The Scholar Emperor [[Constantine VII]], being crowned by Christ.]]

==== Panegyrics ====
Even the best writers often could not escape composing the official panegyrics on emperors and their achievements. Typical of this kind of literature are the commemorative poem of [[Paulus Silentiarius]] on the dedication of the [[Hagia Sophia|church of St. Sophia]], and that of [[Georgius Pisides]] on the glory of the prince. Unfavorable conclusions must not be drawn as to the character of these poets, for such eulogies were composed by not only courtiers like Psellus and [[Manuel Holobolos]] (13th century), but also by independent characters like Eustathius and Michael Acominatus. It had become traditional, and so handed down from imperial Rome to Byzantium as a part of ancient rhetoric with all the extravagance of a thoroughly decadent literature (F. Gregorovius). It was a sort of necessary concession to despotism; popular taste was not in general offended by it.

==== Satires ====
The father of Byzantine satire is [[Lucian]]. His celebrated "Dialogues of the Dead" furnished the model for two works, one of which, the "[[Timarion]]" (12th century) is marked by more rude humour, the other, "[[Mazaris]]" (15th century), by keen satire. Each describes a journey to the underworld and conversations with dead contemporaries; in the former their defects are lashed with good-natured raillery; in the latter, under the masks of dead men, living persons and contemporary conditions, especially at the Byzantine Court, are sharply stigmatized. The former is more a literary satire, the latter a political pamphlet, with keen personal thrusts and without literary value, but with all the greater interest for the history of civilization; the former is in a genuinely popular tone, the latter in vulgar and crude [Cf. [[Henry Fanshawe Tozer|Tozer]] in ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' (1881), II.233-270; [[Krumbacher]], op. cit., 198-211.]

Two popular offshoots of the "Timarion", the "Apokopos" and the "Piccatoros" are discussed below. Another group of satires takes the form of dialogues between animals, manifestly a development from the Christian popular book known as the ''[[Physiologus]]''. Such satires describe assemblages of quadrupeds, birds, and fishes, and recite their [[parody|lampoon]]ing remarks upon the clergy, the bureaucracy, the foreign nations in the Byzantine Empire, etc. See also ''[[An Entertaining Tale of Quadrupeds]]''

Here belong also the parodies in the form of church poems, and in which the clergy themselves took part, e.g. Bishop [[Nicetas of Serræ]] (11th century). One example of this sacrilegious literature, though not fully understood, is the "Mockery of a Beardless Man," in the form of an obscene [[liturgy]] (14th century).

==== Didactic ====
Didactic poetry found its model in the "To Demonikos" ascribed to Isocrates. The greatest example of this type of literature in Byzantium is the "Spaneas" (12th century), a hortatory poem addressed by an emperor to his nephew, a sort of "[[Mirror for Princes]]". Some few offshoots from this are found in the popular literature of Crete in the 15th and 16th centuries, handed down under the names of [[Stephanos Sahlikis|Sahlikis]] and Depharanus. Here also belong the ranting theological exhortations resembling those of the Capuchin in [[Schiller]]'s "Wallenstein". Such, for instance, are that of Geogillas after the great plague of Rhodes (1498) and the oracular prophecies on the end of the Byzantine empire current under the name of [[Leo VI the Wise|Emperor Leo]] (886-911). (Krumbacher, 332, 336, 343, 352, 366.) &lt;!-- Huh? --&gt;

==== Begging-poem ====
A late Byzantine variety of the laudatory poem is the begging-poem, the poetical lament of hungry authors and the parasites of the court. Its chief representatives are [[Theodorus Prodromus]] and the grossly flattering [[Manuel Philes]], the former of whom lived under the Comneni (12th century), the latter under the Palaeologi (13th century). For historians such poetical wails of distress as Prodromus addressed to the emperor are of value because they give interesting pictures of street and business life in the capital. (Cf. Krumbacher, 324, 333.)

====Romance novel====
{{main article|Byzantine novel}}
The ancient Greek novel was imitated by four writers of the 12th century: [[Eustathios Makrembolites]], [[Theodore Prodromos]], [[Niketas Eugenianos]], and [[Constantine Manasses]].

=== Ecclesiastical and theological literature ===
The first flowering of ecclesiastical literature of Byzantium is Hellenistic in form and Oriental in spirit. This period falls in the 4th century and is closely associated with the names of the Greek Fathers of Alexandria, Palestine, Jerusalem, Cyrene, and [[Cappadocia]]. Their works, which cover the whole field of ecclesiastical prose literature—dogma, [[exegesis]], and [[homiletics]]—became canonical for the whole Byzantine period; the last important work is the ecclesiastical history of [[Evagrius Scholasticus|Evagrius]]. Beyond controversial writings against sectarians and the [[iconoclasm|Iconoclasts]], later works consist merely of compilations and commentaries, in the form of the so-called ''Catenae''; even the ''Fountain of Knowledge'' of [[John of Damascus]] (8th century), the fundamental manual of Greek theology, though systematically worked out by a learned and keen intellect, is merely a gigantic collection of materials. Even the homily clings to a pseudo-classical, rhetorical foundation, and tends more to external breadth, not to inwardness and depth.

Only three kinds of ecclesiastical literature, which were as yet undeveloped in the 4th century, exhibit later an independent growth. These were the ecclesiastical poetry of the 6th century, popular lives of the saints of the 7th, and the mystic writings of the 11th and 12th centuries. The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' suggests that classical forms were insufficient to express Christian thought to best effect: in several collections of early Christian correspondence it is not the rhythmic laws of Greek rhetorical style which govern the composition, but those of Semitic and Syriac prose. [[Cardinal Pitra]] hypothesizes that the rhythmic poetry of the Byzantines originates in the Jewish Psalms of the Septuagint. This rhythmic principle accords with the linguistic character of the later Greek, which used a stress accent as it had already been developed in Syriac poetry rather than the classical tonal accent.

[[Romanos the Melodist]] was the first great ecclesiastical poet of the Greeks to fully embrace the stress accent as a rhythmic principle. A contemporary and countryman of the chronicler Malalas, also a reformer of the Greek literary language, Romanos was a Syrian of Jewish descent, Christianized at an early age. What Malalas is to prose, Romanos is to the Christian poetry of the Greek Middle Ages. Though he did not go so far as Malalas, he released poetry from meters based on quantitative and tonal scansion; he brought it into harmony with the latest poetics prevailing in Syria as well as with the evolving character of the Greek language. Romanos soon went to Constantinople, where he became a deacon of the [[Hagia Sophia]], and where he is said to have first developed his gift for hymn-writing.

[[Image:RossanoGospelsFolio007vGoodSamaritan.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration of the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] from the Rossano Gospels, believed to be the oldest surviving illustrated New Testament.]]

Romanos borrowed the form of his poems, the material, and many of their themes partly from the Bible and partly from the (metrical) homilies of the Syrian Father [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] (4th century). He wrote hymns on the Passion of the Lord, on the betrayal by Judas, Peter's denial, Mary before the Cross, the Ascension, the Ten Virgins, and the Last Judgment, while his Old Testament themes mention the history of Joseph and the three young men in the fiery furnace. He is said to have composed about a thousand hymns, of which only eighty have survived, evidently because in the 9th century the so-called ''canones'', linguistically and metrically more artistic in form, replaced much of his work in the Greek Liturgy. Thenceforth his hymns held their own in only a few of the remoter monasteries. Characteristic of his technique is the great length of his hymns, which are regularly composed of from twenty to thirty stanzas (τροπαρια) of from twelve to twenty-one verses each, very finely wrought and varied in metrical structure, and in construction transparent and diverse. They do not resemble contemporary Latin hymns so much as the oratorios of the early 20th century, also using antiphonal rendering by alternative choirs. This also explains the dramatic character of many hymns, with their inserted dialogues and choric songs, as in "Peter's Denial", a little drama of human boastfulness and weakness, and the last part of the "History of Joseph", the "Psalm of the Apostles", and the "Birth of Jesus". Other pieces, like the hymn on the [[Last Judgment]], are purely descriptive in character, though even in them the rhetorical and dogmatic elements seriously impair the artistic effect.

Some, like Bouvy and Krumbacher, place him among the greatest hymn-writers of all times; others, like Cardinal Pitra, are more conservative. For a final judgment a complete edition of the hymns is needed. Compared to Latin church poets such as Ambrose and Prudentius, his surviving works tend towards a more rhetorically flowery, digressive, and dogmatic verse. He is fond of symbolic pictures and figures of speech, antitheses, assonances, especially witty ''jeux d'esprit'', which contrast with his characteristic simplicity of diction and construction. These embellishments interrupt the smooth flow of his lines, and often the sequence of thought in his hymns is clouded by the dragging in of dogmatic questions—in the celebrated Christmas hymn the question of the miraculous birth of Jesus is discussed four times, with a comfortable amplitude that betrays the theologian thrusting the poet aside. The theologian is also too evident in his allusions to the Old Testament when dealing with New Testament incidents; Mary at the birth of Jesus compares her destiny to that of Sarah, the Magi liken the star that went before the Israelites in the wilderness, and so on. The frequent citation of passages from the prophets seem more like unimpassioned paraphrases than like inspired poetry. In fact Romanos does not possess the abundant and highly coloured imagery of the earliest Greek church poets, nor their fine grasp of nature. The reader also gathers the impression that the height of the poet's imagination is not in proportion with the depth of his piety—there often appears in him something naive, almost homely, as when Mary expresses her pleasure in the Magi and calls attention to their utility for the impending Flight into Egypt. There are passages, however, in which devout fervor carries the imagination along with it and elevates the poetic tone, as in the jubilant invitation to the dance (in the Easter-song), in which thoughts of spring and of the Resurrection are harmoniously blended:

:Why thus faint-hearted?
:Why veil ye your faces?
:Lift up your hearts!
:Christ is arisen!
:Join in the dances,
:And with us proclaim it:
:The Lord is ascended,
:Gleaming and gloried,
:He who was born
:Of the giver of light.
:Cease then your mourning,
:Rejoice in blessedness:
:Springtime has come.
:So bloom now, ye lilies,
:Bloom and be fruitful!
:Naught bringeth destruction.
:Clap we our hands
:And shout: Risen is He
:Who helpeth the fallen ones
:To rise again.

Ecclesiastical poetry did not long remain on the high level to which Romanos had raised it. The "Hymnus Acathistus" (of unknown authorship) of the 7th century, a sort of [[Te Deum]] in praise of the Mother of God, is the last great monument of Greek church poetry, comparable to the hymns of Romanos, which it has even outlived in fame. It has had numerous imitators and as late as the 17th century was translated into Latin.

The rapid decline of Greek hymnology begins as early as the 7th century, the period of [[Andrew of Crete]]. Religious sentiments in hymns were choked by a classical formalism which stifled all vitality. The overvaluation of technique in details destroyed the sense of proportion in the whole. This seems to be the only explanation for the so-called canones first found in the collection of Andrew of Crete. While a canon is a combination of a number of hymns or chants (generally nine) of three or four strophes each, the "Great Canon" of Andrew actually numbers 250 strophes, a "single idea is spun out into serpentine arabesques".

Pseudo-classical artificiality found an even more advanced representative in [[John of Damascus]], in the opinion of the Byzantines the foremost writer of canones, who took as a model [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], even reintroducing the principle of quantity into ecclesiastical poetry. Religious poetry was in this way reduced to mere trifling, for in the 11th century, which witnessed the decline of Greek hymnology and the revival of pagan humanism, Michael Psellus began parodying church hymns, a practice that took root in popular culture. Didactic poems took this form without being regarded as blasphemous.

Religious drama did not thrive in the Byzantine era. The only example is the ''Suffering of Christ'' (''Christus Patiens'', ''Χριστὸς пάσχων ''), written in the 11th or 12th century; of its 2,640 verses, about one-third are borrowed from ancient dramas, chiefly from those of [[Euripides]], and Mary, the chief character, sometimes recites verses from the "Medea" of Euripides, again from the "Electra" of [[Sophocles]], or the "Prometheus" of [[Aeschylus]]. The composition is evidently the production of a theologian trained in the classics, but without the slightest idea of dramatic art. It is made up chiefly of lamentations and reports of messengers. Even the most effective scenes, those which precede the Crucifixion, are described by messengers; almost two-thirds of the text are given to the descent from the Cross, the lament of Mary, and the apparition of Christ. (Cf. Van Cleef, "The Pseudo-Gregorian Drama ''Christos paschon'' in its relation to the text of Euripides" in ''Transactions of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences'', VIII, 363-378; Krumbacher, 312.)

Between ecclesiastical poetry and ecclesiastical prose stands the theologico-didactic poem, a favorite species of ancient Christian literature. One of its best examples is the "Hexaemeron" of Georgius Pisides, a spirited hymn on the universe and its marvels, i.e. all living creatures. Taken as a whole, it is somewhat conventional; only the description of the minor forms of life, especially of the animals, reveals the skill of the epigrammatist and nature-lover's gift of affectionate observation.

Besides sacred poetry, [[hagiography]] flourished from the 6th to the 11th century. This species of literature developed from the old [[Martyrology|martyrologies]], and became the favorite form of popular literature. It flourished from the 8th to the 11th century, and was concerned principally with monastic life. Unfortunately, the rhetorical language was in violent contrast with the simple nature of the contents, so that the chief value of this literature is historical.

More popular in style are the biographers of saints of the 6th and 7th centuries. The oldest and most important of them is [[Cyril of Scythopolis]] (in Palestine), whose biographies of saints and monks are distinguished for the reliability of their facts and dates. Of great interest also for their contributions to the history of culture and of ethics and for their genuinely popular language are the writings of Leontius, Archbishop of Cyprus (7th century), especially his life of the Patriarch John (surnamed The Merciful), Eleemosynarius of Alexandria. (Cf. [[Heinrich Gelzer]], ''Kleine Schriften'', Leipzig, 1907.) This life describes for us a man who in spite of his peculiarities honestly tried "to realize a pure Biblical Christianity of self-sacrificing love", and whose life brings before us the customs and ideas of the lower classes of the people of Alexandria.

The romance of Balaam and Joasaph (also [[Barlaam and Josaphat]]) was another popular work of Byzantine origin now elevated to universal literature. It is the "Song of Songs" of Christian asceticism, illustrated by the experience of the Indian prince Joasaph, who is led by the hermit Barlaam to abandon the joys of life, and as a true Christian to renounce the world. The material of the story is originally Indian, indeed [[Buddhism|Buddhistic]], for the origin of Joasaph was [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The Greek version originated in the Sabbas monastery in Palestine about the middle of the 7th century. It did not circulate widely until the 11th century, when it became known to all Western Europe through the medium of a Latin translation [Cf. [[F. C. Conybeare]], "The Barlaam and Josaphat legend," in ''Folk-lore'' (1896), VII, 101 sqq.]

The ascetic conception of life was embedded in the Byzantine character and was strengthened by the high development of monastic institutions. The latter in turn brought forth a broad ascetic literature, though it does not further deepen the asceticism of its great exponent, St. [[Basil of Caesarea]].

Less extensively cultivated, but excelling in quality, are Byzantine mystical writings. The true founder of a distinctively ''Byzantine'' [[mysticism]] was [[Maximus the Confessor]] (7th century), who deepened the tradition of Christian Neoplatonism, as found in the Pseudo-Dionysius, with the resources of Orthodox Christology. No other writer in Eastern Christian tradition surpasses Maximus in speculative range and originality. Later representatives of this mystical tradition were [[Symeon the New Theologian]] and [[Nicetas Stethatos]] in the 11th, and [[Nikolaos Kavasilas]] in the 14th century. The Byzantine mystical writers differ from those of Western Europe chiefly in their attitude to ecclesiastical ceremonies, to which they adhered implicitly, seeing in it a profound symbol of the spiritual life of the church, where Occidentals see an attempt to displace the inner life with external pomp. Accordingly, Symeon strictly observed the ceremonial rules of the church, regarding them, however, only as a means to the attainment of ethical perfection. His principal work (published only in Latin) is a collection of prose pieces and hymns on communion with God. He is akin to the chief [[German mystic]]s in his tendency towards pantheism. Of Symeon's equally distinguished pupil, Nicetas Stethatos, we need only say that he cast off his teacher's [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] tendencies. The last great mystic Kavasilas, Archbishop of Saloniki, revived the teaching of [[Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite]], but in the plan of his principal work, "Life in Christ", exhibits a complete independence of all other worlds and is without a parallel in Byzantine asceticism.

=== Popular poetry ===
The [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|capture of Constantinople]] and establishment of the [[Latinokratia|Latin kingdoms]] in the year 1204 displaced or supplanted aristocratic and ecclesiastic controls on literary taste and style. In response to new influences from the [[Greek East and Latin West|Latin West]], Byzantine popular literature moved in different directions. Whereas literary poetry springs from the rationalistic, classical atmosphere of the Hellenistic period, popular poetry, or folk-song, is an outgrowth of the idyllic, romantic literature of the same period. As the literary works had their prototypes in Lucian, Heliodorus, Achilles Tatius, and Nonnus, the popular works imitated [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], [[Callimachus]], [[Theocritus]], and [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]].

The chief characteristic of folk-song throughout the Greek Middle Ages is its lyric note, which constantly finds expression in emotional turns. In Byzantine literature, on the other hand, the refinement of erotic poetry was due to the influence of the love-poetry of [[chivalry]] introduced by Frankish knights in the 13th century and later. The Byzantines imitated and adapted the romantic and legendary materials these westerners brought. Italian influences led to the revival of the drama. That celebration of the achievements of Greek heroes in popular literature was the result of the conflicts which the Greeks sustained during the Middle Ages with the border nations to the east of the empire. Popular books relating the deeds of ancient heroes had long-standing and widespread currency throughout the East; these too revived heroic poetry, though imparted with a deep romantic tinge. The result was a complete upheaval of popular ideals and a broadening of the popular horizon as Atticist tendencies were gradually eroded.

There was, consequently, a complete reconstruction of the literary types of Byzantium. Of all the varieties of artistic poetry there survived only the romance, though this became more serious in its aims, and its province expanded. Of metrical forms there remained only the political (fifteen-syllable) verse. From these simple materials there sprang forth an abundance of new poetic types. Alongside of the narrative romance of heroism and love there sprang up popular love lyrics, and even the beginnings of the modern drama.
[[Image:Troodos mountains.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Troodos Mountains]], from which [[Digenis Akritas]] used to jump to [[Asia Minor]] in the epic poem]]
The only genuine heroic epic of the Byzantines is the ''[[Digenis Akritas]]'', a popular poetic crystallization of the 10th- and 11th-century conflicts between the Byzantine wardens of the [[marches]] (ακρίτης, [[akrites]]) and the [[Saracens]] in Eastern Asia Minor. The nucleus of this epic goes back to the 12th or 13th century, its final literary form to the 15th. Though the [[schoolmen]] edited the original poems beyond recognition, an approximate idea of the original poem may be gathered from the numerous echoes of it extant in popular poetry. The existing versions exhibit a blending of several cycles, modeled after the Homeric poems. Its principal subjects are love, adventures, battles, and a patriarchal, idyllic enjoyment of life; it is a mixture of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the majority of the material being drawn from the latter, suffused with a Christian atmosphere. Genuine piety and a strong family feeling combine with an intimate sympathy with nature. Artistically, the work lacks the dramatic quality and diverse characters of the Germanic and classical Greek epics; it must be compared with the Slavic and Oriental heroic songs, among which it properly belongs.

The love-romance of the Greek Middle Ages is the result of the fusion of the sophistical Alexandro-Byzantine romance and the medieval French popular romance, on the basis of a Hellenistic view of life and nature. This is proved by its three chief creations, composed in the 13th and 14th centuries. ''[[Kallimachos and Chrysorrhoe]]'', ''[[Belthandros and Chrysantza]]'', ''[[Lybistros and Rhodamne]]''. While the first and the last of these are markedly influenced by Byzantine romance in thought and manner of treatment, the second begins to show the aesthetic and ethical influence of the Old-French romance; indeed, its story often recalls the [[Tristan]] legend. The style is clearer and more transparent, the action more dramatic, than in the extant versions of the Digenis legend. The ethical idea is the romantic idea of knighthood—the winning of the loved one by valour and daring, not by blind chance as in the Byzantine literary romances. Along with these independent adaptations of French material, are direct translations from "Flore et Blanchefleur", "Pierre et Maguelonne", and others, which have passed into the domain of universal literature.

To the period of [[Frangokratia|Frankish conquest]] belongs also the metrical ''[[Chronicle of the Morea]]'' (14th century). It was composed by a Frank brought up in Greece, though a foe of the Greeks. Its object was, amid the constantly progressing hellenization of the Western conquerors, to remind them of the spirit of their ancestors. Therefore, it is only Greek in language; in literary form and spirit it is wholly Frankish. The author "describes minutely the feudal customs which had been transplanted to the soil of Greece, and this perhaps is his chief merit; the deliberations of the High Court are given with the greatest accuracy, and he is quite familiar with the practice of feudal law" (J. Schmitt). As early as the 14th century the Chronicle was translated into Spanish and in the 15th into French and Italian.

About the same time and in the same locality the small islands off the coast of Asia Minor, appeared the earliest collection of neo-Greek love songs, known as the "''Rhodian Love-Songs''". Besides songs of various sorts and origins, they contain a complete romance, told in the form of a play on numbers, a youth being obliged to compose a hundred verses in honor of the maiden whom he worships before she returns his love, each verse corresponding to the numbers one to one hundred.

Between the days of the French influence in the 13th and 14th centuries and those of Italian in the 16th and 17th, there was a short romantic and popular revival of the ancient legendary material. There was neither much need nor much appreciation for this revival, and few of the ancient heroes and their heroic deeds are adequately treated. The best of these works is the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'', based on the story of [[Alexander the Great]], a revised version of the [[Pseudo-Callisthenes]] of the Ptolemaic period, which is also the source of the western versions of the ''Alexander Romance''. The ''[[Achilleis byzantina|Achilleis]]'', on the other hand, though written in the popular verse and not without taste, is wholly devoid of antique local colour, and is rather a romance of French chivalry than a history of Achilles. Lastly, of two compositions on the [[Trojan War]], one is wholly crude and barbarous, the other, though better, is a literal translation of the old French poem of [[Benoît de Sainte-More]].

To these products of the 14th century may be added two of the 16th, both describing a descent into the lower world, evidently popular offshoots of the Timarion and Mazaris already mentioned. To the former corresponds the ''Apokopos'', a satire of the dead on the living; to the latter the ''Piccatores'', a metrical piece decidedly lengthy but rather unpoetic, while the former has many poetical passages (e.g. the procession of the dead) and betrays the influence of Italian literature. In fact [[Italian literature]] impressed its popular character on the Greek popular poetry of the 16th and 17th centuries, as [[French literature]] had done in the 13th and 14th.

==== Cretan popular poetry ====
As a rich popular poetry sprang up during the last-mentioned period on the islands off the coast of Asia Minor, so now a similar literature developed on the island of [[Crete]]. Its most important creations are the romantic epic ''[[Erotokritos]]'' and the dramas ''[[Erophile]]'' and ''The Sacrifice of Abraham'' with a few minor pictures of customs and manners. These works fall chronologically outside the limits of Byzantine literature; nevertheless, as a necessary complement and continuation of the preceding period, they should be discussed here.

The ''Erotokritos'' is a long romantic poem of chivalry, lyric in characters and didactic in purpose, the work of [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]], a hellenized Venetian of the 16th century. It abounds in themes and ideas drawn from the folk-poetry of the time. In the story of Erotokritos and Arethusa the poet glorifies love and friendship, chivalric courage, constancy, and self-sacrifice. Although foreign influences do not obtrude themselves, and the poem, as a whole, has a national Greek flavour, it reveals the various cultural elements, Byzantine, Romance, and Oriental, without giving, however, the character of a composite.

The lyrical love tragedy ''Erophile'' is more of a mosaic, being a combination of two Italian tragedies, with the addition of lyrical intermezzos from [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', and choral songs from his ''Aminta''. Nevertheless, the materials are handled with independence, and more harmoniously arranged than in the original; the father who has killed his daughter's lover is slain not by his daughter's hand, but by the ladies of his palace, thus giving a less offensive impression. Owing to the lyric undertone of the works some parts of it have survived in popular tradition until the present time.

The [[mystery play]] of ''The Sacrifice of Abraham'' is a little psychological masterpiece, apparently an independent work. The familiar and trite Biblical incidents are reset in the patriarchal environment of Greek family life. The poet emphasizes the mental struggles of Sarah, the resignation of Abraham to the Divine will, the anxious forebodings of Isaac, and the affectionate sympathy of the servants, in other words, a psychological analysis of the characters. The mainspring of the action is Sarah's fore-knowledge of what is to happen, evidently the invention of the poet to display the power of maternal love. The diction is distinguished by high poetic beauty and by a thorough mastery of versification.

Other products of Cretan literature are a few adaptations of Italian pastorals, a few erotic and idyllic poems, like the so-called "''Seduction Tale''" (an echo of the Rhodian Love-Songs), and the lovely, but ultra-sentimental, pastoral idyll of the ''Beautiful Shepherdess''.

== The legacy of Byzantine literature ==
The Roman supremacy in governmental life did not disappear. The subjection of the Church to the power of the State led to a governmental ecclesiasticism, causing friction with [[Roman Catholic Church]], which had remained relatively independent.

Greek eventually overtook [[Latin]] as the [[official language]] of the government, the "Novellae" of [[Justinian I]] being the last Latin monument. As early as the 7th century [[Greek language]] had made great progress, and by the 11th Greek was supreme, though it never supplanted the numerous other languages of the empire.

The Eastern Roman Empire divided European civilization into two parts: one [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], the other Greek and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]. These cultures differed ethnographically, linguistically, ecclesiastically, and historically. Imperial [[Russia]], the [[Balkans]], and [[Ottoman Empire]] were the direct heirs of Byzantine civilization; the first two particularly in ecclesiastical, political, and cultural respects (through the translation and adaptation of sacred, historical, and popular literature); the third in respect to civil government.

Indirectly, the Empire protected western Europe for centuries from war, fighting off various invaders and migratory populations. Byzantium was also a treasury of ancient Greek literature. During the Middle Ages, until the capture of the Constantinople, the West was acquainted only with Roman literature. Greek antiquity was first carried to Italy by the treasures brought by fugitive Greek humanists, many of whom were delegates at the [[Council of Florence]] from 1431 to 1449.

Byzantine culture had a direct influence upon southern and central Europe in church music and church poetry, though this was only in the very early period (until the 7th century).

Byzantine culture had a definite impact upon the Near East, especially upon the [[Persian people|Persians]], and the [[Arabs]].

There is no comprehensive history of Byzantine literature written in English, although the [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] provides excellent coverage of individual authors and topics. The chapters of Horrocks that cover the medieval period are useful for the "language question." The ''History'' of Kazhdan covers only the early period. Beaton and Lauxtermann are useful on "low" and "high" verse, respectively.

The study of Byzantine literature as a self-sufficient discipline originated in the German-speaking world, and the most important general surveys are written in this language. Beck and Hunger remain the standard works on theological and secular literature, respectively, although Krumbacher and Moravcsik are still valuable. Rosenqvist is a recent and useful introduction to the subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5030">The following is '''a list of unproduced [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] projects''' in roughly chronological order. During his long career, American film director [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects, are officially scrapped or fell in [[development hell]].
== 1980s ==

=== ''Indiana Jones and the Monkey King'' ===
In 1985, Columbus wrote an script for a third ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' film entitled ''Indiana Jones and the Monkey King''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5932803/100-wonderful-and-terrible-movies-that-never-existed|title=100 Wonderful and Terrible Movies That Never Existed|first=Charlie Jane|last=Anders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus' script was about the trip of Indy along his assistant Betsy to a secret city protected by soldier gorillas and governed by the evil [[Monkey King]]. According to Columbus, he wrote the script so that the story doesn't look like the previous film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/31313/lost-scripts-part-i-indiana-jones-and-monkey-king|title=The Lost Scripts, Part I: Indiana Jones and the Monkey King|date=26 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the end, Columbus' script was rejected and the film was finally released in 1989 under the title ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' and directed by [[Steven Spielberg]].

== 1990s ==

=== ''Fantastic Four'' ===
In 1995, Columbus wrote for [[20th Century Fox]] a script for the long time planned ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' feature-length film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1995/voices/columns/columbus-seeing-red-after-nine-reviews-1117862735/|title=Columbus seeing red after ‘Nine’ reviews|first=Army|last=Archerd|date=13 July 1995|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was supposed to be released around the 2001 summer. [[Peter Segal]] was attached to direct it, but later, he dropped the project, so [[Raja Gosnell]]  took the director's chair, but he dropped it after being hired by [[Warner Bros.]] to direct ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' and [[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed|its sequel]]. After this, director [[Peyton Reed]] entered into the project and wanted to cast [[Renée Zellweger]] as [[Invisible Woman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therobotsvoice.com/2015/02/fantastic_four_marvel_chris_columbus_dr_doom_miles_teller_kate_mara_michael_b_jordan_tim_story.php|title=9 Things Fox Got Right With Their 1996 Fantastic Four Script...That We Never Got to See - The Robot's Voice|date=11 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|film]] was finally released in 2005, directed by [[Tim Story]] and written by [[Michael France]] and [[Mark Frost]].

=== ''Galaxy High School'' ===
Plans for a live-action film adaptation of his own 1986 animated TV series [[Galaxy High]] was planned in partnership with [[John H. Williams]] of [[Vanguard Films &amp; Animation|Vanguard Films]], and reteamed with Chris Columbus to develop the big screen version of ''Galaxy High School''. After various development deals with both [[DreamWorks]] and [[Paramount Pictures]], Sofare nothing ever came out of it, either being scrapped or in [[development hell]].

=== ''Daredevil'' ===
In 1997, Columbus was hired by [[Columbia Pictures]] to write an script for a ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'' feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/04/26/daredevil-the-man-without-ed|title=Daredevil: The Man Without Ed|first=|last=Stax|date=26 April 2001|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus' script was later leaked on Internet in 1999. Despite this, Columbia dropped the project and [[20th Century Fox]] bought the rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/movies|title=Movie Reviews, Trailers, Interviews, Wikis &amp; Posters for Movies - IGN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was finally released in 2003 and directed by [[Mark Steven Johnson]].

== 2000s ==

=== ''The Sub-Mariner'' ===
In July 2004, Columbus was hired to direct a film adaptation of [[Namor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/news/columbus-off-to-sea-1117914347/|title=Columbus off to sea|first=Claude|last=Brodesser|date=3 December 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was supposed to be released in 2007 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/87061-marvels-film-slate-from-3rd-quarter-report|title=Marvel's Film Slate From 3rd Quarter Report - SuperHeroHype|date=28 October 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2005, Columbus abandoned the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/features/89791-chris-columbus-passes-on-sub-mariner|title=Chris Columbus Passes on Sub-Mariner - SuperHeroHype|date=12 November 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cirebon Mask Dance''' or ''tari topeng Cirebon'' is a local indigenous art form of [[Cirebon]] in Java, including [[Indramayu]] and [[Jatibarang, Indramayu|Jatibarang]], [[West Java]] and [[Brebes]], [[Central Java]]. It is called mask dance because the dancers use masks when dancing. There is a lot of variety in Javanese mask dance, both in terms of the dance style and the stories to be conveyed. Sometimes the mask dance can be performed by solo dancers, or it can also be performed by several people.

'''''Cloud Atlas''''' is a 2004 novel, the third book by British author [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]]. It consists of six nested stories that take the reader from the remote South Pacific in the nineteenth century to a distant, [[post-apocalyptic]] future. It won the [[British Book Awards]] Literary Fiction Award and the [[Richard &amp; Judy]] Book of the Year award, and was short-listed for the 2004 [[Booker Prize]], [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Nebula Award]], and [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]], among other awards.

[[Cloud Atlas (film)|A film adaptation of the same name]] was released in 2012.

== Plot summary ==
The book consists of six nested stories, whereof each is read (or observed) by a main character of the next. The first five stories are each interrupted at a pivotal moment. After the sixth story, the other five stories are closed, in reverse chronological order, and each ends with the main character reading or observing the chronologically previous work in the chain. Each story contains a document, movie, or tradition that appears in a previous story.

=== The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing (Part 1) ===

The first story begins in the [[Chatham Islands]] in the mid-nineteenth century where Adam Ewing, a guileless American [[notary]] from [[San Francisco]] during the [[California Gold Rush]], awaits repairs to his ship. Ewing witnesses a [[Moriori people|Moriori]] slave being flogged by a [[Māori people|Maori]] overseer. During the punishment, the victim, Autua, sees pity in the eyes of Adam Ewing and smiles.  Later Ewing ascends a high hill called Conical Tor and stumbles into its crater, where he finds himself surrounded by faces carved into trees. Reasoning that those who carved the faces must have had egress from the crater, he escapes. As the ship gets underway, Dr. Goose, Ewing's only friend aboard the ship, examines the injuries sustained on the volcano and Ewing also mentions his chronic ailment. The doctor diagnoses it as a fatal parasite and recommends a course of treatment. Meanwhile, Autua has stowed away in Ewing's cabin; and Ewing breaks this news to the Captain, to whom Autua proves himself a first class seaman, whereupon the Captain puts him to work for his passage to [[Hawaii]].

=== Letters from Zedelghem (Part 1) ===

The next story is set in [[Zedelgem|Zedelghem]], near [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]], in 1931. It is told in the form of letters from Robert Frobisher, a recently disowned and penniless bisexual young English musician, to his lover Rufus Sixsmith, after Frobisher journeys to Zedelghem to become an [[amanuensis]] to the reclusive once-great composer Vyvyan Ayrs, who is dying of [[syphilis]] and nearly blind. Soon, Frobisher produces  ''Der Todtenvogel'' ("The Death Bird") from a basic melody that Ayrs gives him. It is performed nightly in Kraków, and Ayrs is much praised. Frobisher takes pride in this and has begun composing his own music again.  Frobisher and Ayrs' wife Jocasta become lovers, but her daughter Eva remains suspicious of him. Frobisher sells rare books from Ayrs' collection to a fence, including half of ''The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing'', and has suspicions that Dr. Goose is poisoning Adam. Once, Ayrs has Frobisher write a song inspired by a dream of a "nightmarish cafe", deep underground, wherein "the waitresses all had the same face", and ate soap.&lt;ref&gt;Thus prefiguring the Sonmi fabricants, whose restaurant is underground and whose only food is called "Soap".&lt;/ref&gt; As the summer comes to an end, Jocasta thanks Frobisher for "giving Vyvyan his music back", and Frobisher agrees to stay until next summer.

=== Half-Lives&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; The First Luisa Rey Mystery (Part 1) ===

The third story is written in the style of a mystery/thriller novel, set in the fictional city of Buenas Yerbas, [[California]], in 1975, with Luisa Rey, a young journalist. She meets Rufus Sixsmith in a stalled elevator, and she tells him about her late father, one of the few incorruptible policemen in the city, who became a famous war correspondent. Later, when Sixsmith tells Luisa his concern that the Seaboard HYDRA [[nuclear power plant]] is not safe, he is found dead of apparent suicide. Luisa believes that the businessmen in charge of the plant are assassinating potential whistle-blowers. From Sixsmith's hotel room, Luisa acquires some of Frobisher's letters. Another plant employee gives her a copy of Sixsmith's report, and then the plane he is on explodes. Before Luisa can report her findings on the nuclear power plant or the murders, a Seaboard-hired assassin who has been following her forces her car — along with Sixsmith's incriminating report — off a bridge.

=== The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish (Part 1) ===

The fourth story is comic in tone, jarring after the previous story, and is set in Britain in the present day, wherein Timothy Cavendish, a 65-year-old [[vanity press]] publisher, flees the brothers of his gangster client, whose book is experiencing high sales after the murder of a book critic. They threaten violence if monetary demands are not met. Timothy's own brother, exasperated by his frequent previous pleas for financial aid, books him into a menacing nursing home. Timothy signs custody papers thinking that he is registering into a hotel, where he can stay until his personal and financial problems can be solved. Learning the truth that he is here indefinitely without the ability to leave or communicate with anyone, and subject to the staff's complete control, he attempts flight but is stopped by a security guard and confined. Timothy briefly mentions reading a manuscript entitled ''Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery'', but is not impressed by the prospective author's manuscript. Timothy settles into his new surroundings, while still trying to plot a way out. One day, he is struck by a seizure, just as the chapter ends.

=== An Orison of Sonmi~451 (Part 1) ===

The fifth story is set in Nea So Copros,&lt;ref&gt;A future version of the proposed [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] with the [[Juche]] as the highest power.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[dystopia]]n futuristic state in [[Korea]], derived from [[corporate culture]]. It is told in the form of an interview between Sonmi~451 and an "archivist" recording her story after her arrest and trial. Several small spelling and grammatical changes are made, to represent the change in language. Sonmi~451 is a [[Clone (genetics)|fabricant]] waitress at a fast-food restaurant called Papa Song's.&lt;ref&gt;Papa Song's appears to be a future [[McDonald's]]: mention is made of [[Golden Arches]] and a red/yellow color scheme.&lt;/ref&gt; Clones grown in vats are revealed to be the predominant source of cheap labor. The "pureblood" (natural-born) society retards the fabricants' consciousness by chemical manipulation, using a food she refers to as "Soap". After twelve years as slaves, fabricants are promised retirement to a fabricant community in Honolulu. In her own narration, Sonmi encounters members of a university faculty and students, who take her from the restaurant for study and assist her to become self-aware, or "ascended"; she describes watching ''The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish'' as a pre-Skirmishes film (wherein the "Skirmishes" are a major global disaster or war that destroyed most of the world except Nea So Copros ([[East Asia]]), which foreshadows "The Fall" in the subsequent chapter "Sloosha's Crossin", in which Nea So Copros, and most of humanity's technological ability, have ended in disaster; the destroyed areas are identified as "deadlands" full of disease, ruins, and [[radioactive contamination]]). During the scene when Cavendish suffers his seizure, a student interrupts to tell Sonmi and her rescuer Hae-Joo Im that Professor Mephi, Hae-Joo's professor, has been arrested, and that policy enforcers have orders to interrogate Hae-Joo and kill Sonmi on sight. Hae-Joo then reveals that they are members of an antigovernment rebel movement called Union.

=== Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After ===
The sixth story occupies the central position in the novel and is the only one not interrupted, wherein Zachry, an old man, tells a story from his youth, speaking an imagined future English dialect. It is gradually revealed that he lived in a post-apocalyptic society on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of [[Hawaii]]. His people, called the valley folk, are peaceful farmers but are often raided by the [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona]] tribe, who are cannibalistic slavers. Zachry is plagued by moral doubts stemming from his wrongly blaming himself for his father's death years ago.  Zachry's people worship a goddess called Sonmi and recall a 'Fall' in which the civilized peoples of Earth — known as the 'Old Uns' — were destroyed, and left the survivors to [[primitivism]]. Big Island is occasionally visited and studied by a technologically sophisticated people known as the Prescients, whereof a woman called Meronym, who has come to learn their ways, is assigned to live with Zachry's family. Zachry becomes suspicious of her, believing that her people are gaining trust before doing harm, and sneaks into her room, where he finds an 'orison': an egg-shaped device for recording and holographic [[videoconferencing]]. Later, Zachry's sister Catkin is poisoned by a [[scorpion fish]], and he persuades Meronym to break her people's rules and give him medicine. When Meronym later requests a guide to the top of [[Mauna Kea]] volcano, Zachry reluctantly guides her there to the ruins of the [[Mauna Kea Observatories]]. Here, Meronym explains the orison and reveals Sonmi's history (introduced in the prior chapter). Upon their return, they go with most of the valley-folk to trade at Honokaa; but Zachry's people are attacked and imprisoned by the Kona who are conquering the territory. Zachry and Meronym eventually escape, and she offers to let Zachry come with them, but he tells her he cannot leave. Wounded, he is taken to a safer island. The story ends with Zachry's child recalling that his father told many unbelievable tales; whereas this one may be true because he has inherited Zachry's copy of Sonmi's orison, which he often watches, even though he does not understand her language.

=== An Orison of Sonmi~451 (Part 2) ===

Guided by Hae-Joo Im, Sonmi goes in disguise to a ship, where she witnesses retired fabricants butchered and recycled into soap, the fabricant food source. The rebels plan to raise all fabricants to self-awareness and thus disrupt the workforce that keeps the corporate government in power. They want her to write a series of abolitionist ''Declarations'' calling for rebellion. She does, knitting in the themes of greed and oppression first brought up in the diary of Adam Ewing, and this final tale agrees with Ewing's ideas that if greed and corruption are allowed to take over, with the selfish overwhelming the weak successively, it will bring down all.

She is then arrested in an elaborately filmed government raid and finds herself telling her tale to the archivist. Sonmi believes that everything that happened to her was instigated by the government to encourage the fear and hatred of fabricants by purebloods. She thinks that Union is run by the government to attract malcontents so that they can be watched and controlled.  However, even knowing that she will be executed, she feels that her show trial and well publicized ''Declarations'' will be inspirational nonetheless to those who will one day change things. Her last wish before her death is to finish watching Cavendish's story, which she is presumed to do.

=== The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish (Part 2) ===

Having mostly recovered from his mild stroke, Cavendish meets a small group of residents also anxious to escape the nursing home: Ernie, Veronica, and the extremely senile Mr. Meeks. He assists their conspiracy to trick Johns Hotchkiss, a fellow patient's grown son, into leaving his car vulnerable to theft. They seize the car and escape, stopping at a bar to celebrate their freedom. They are nearly recaptured by Hotchkiss and the staff but are rescued when Mr. Meeks exhorts the local drinkers to come to their aid.

It is thereafter revealed that Cavendish's secretary Mrs. Latham blackmailed the gangsters with a video-record of their attack upon his office, allowing him to return to his former life in safety. Subsequently, Cavendish obtains the second half of Luisa Rey's story intending to publish it, and he considers having his own recent adventures turned into a film script.

=== Half-Lives&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; The First Luisa Rey Mystery (Part 2) ===

Rey escapes from her sinking car but loses the report. When her newspaper is bought by a subsidiary of Seaboard, she is fired, and Luisa believes that they no longer see her as a threat. She orders a copy of Robert Frobisher's obscure ''Cloud Atlas Sextet'' which she has read about in his letters and is astonished to find that she recognizes it, even though it is a very rare piece. However, Smoke the assassin still pursues her and lures her with a copy of Rufus Sixsmith's report about the power plant. Joe Napier, a security man who knew her father, comes to her rescue, and Smoke and Napier kill each other in a gun fight. Later, Rey exposes the corrupt corporate leaders to the public. At the end of the story, she receives a package from Sixsmith's niece, which contains the remaining eight letters from Robert Frobisher to Rufus Sixsmith.

=== Letters from Zedelghem (Part 2) ===

Frobisher continues to pursue his work with Ayrs while developing his own ''Cloud Atlas Sextet''. He finds himself falling in love with Eva, after she confesses a crush on him, though he is still having an affair with her mother. Jocasta suspects this and threatens to destroy his life if he so much as looks at her daughter. Ayrs also becomes more bold with his plagiarism of Frobisher, now demanding he compose full passages, which Ayrs intends to take credit for. Ayrs also informs him that if he leaves, Ayrs will have him blacklisted claiming he raped Jocasta. In despair, Frobisher leaves anyway, but finds a hotel nearby working to finish his ''Sextet'' and hoping to be reunited with Eva. He convinces himself that they are being kept apart from her parents, but when he finally manages to talk to her he realizes that the man she was talking about being in love with was her Swiss fiancé. Mentally and physically ill Frobisher ultimately decides, with his magnum opus finished and his life now empty of meaning, to kill himself. Before committing [[suicide]] in a bathtub, he writes one last letter to Sixsmith and includes his ''Sextet'' and ''The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing''.

=== The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing (Part 2) ===

Ewing visits the island of [[Raiatea]], where he observes missionaries oppressing the indigenous peoples. On the ship, he falls further ill and realizes at the last minute that Dr. Goose is poisoning him to steal his possessions. He is rescued by Autua and resolves to join [[Abolitionism in the United States|the abolitionist movement]]. In conclusion (of his own journal and of the book), Ewing writes that history is governed by the results of vicious and virtuous acts precipitated by belief: wherefore "a purely predatory world shall consume itself" and "The devil take the hindmost until the foremost is the hindmost", and imagines his father-in-law's response to his becoming an abolitionist, as a warning that Adam's life would amount to one drop in a limitless ocean; whereas Ewing's proposed reply is: "Yet what is any ocean but a multitude of drops?"

== Reception ==
''Cloud Atlas'' had positive reviews from most critics, who felt that it managed to successfully interweave its six stories. The [[BBC]]'s Keily Oakes said that although the structure of the book could be challenging for readers, "David Mitchell has taken six wildly different stories ... and melded them into one fantastic and complex work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Cloud Atlas |author=Oakes, Keily|date=17 October 2004|publisher=[[BBC]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3744012.stm|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called the book "sheer storytelling brilliance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cloud Atlas Review|date=15 May 2004|publisher=''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-mitchell/cloud-atlas/#review|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Miller of ''[[The New York Times]]'' compared it to the "perfect crossword puzzle," in that it was challenging to read but still fun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cloud Atlas Review|date=14 September 2004|work=The New York Times |author=Miller, Laura|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/19/books/review/19MILLERL.html|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]''{{'}}s Hephzibah Anderson called the novel "exhilarating" and commented positively on the links between all six stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Observer Review: Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell|date=28 February 2004|publisher=''[[The Observer]]'' |author=Anderson, Hephzibah|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/feb/29/fiction.davidmitchell|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and [[Booker Prize]] winner [[A. S.

Cloud Atlas|last = Murphy|first = Richard|date = 2004|journal = The Review of Contemporary Fiction|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism focused on the book's failure to meet its lofty goals. ''[[F&amp;SF]]'' reviewer Robert K. J. Killheffer praised Mitchell's "talent and inventiveness and willingness to adopt any mode or voice that furthers his ends," but noted that "for all its pleasures, ''Cloud Atlas'' falls short of revolutionary."&lt;ref&gt;"Books", ''[[F&amp;SF]]'', April 2005, pp.35-37&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave the novel a mixed review, focusing on its clashing themes, with Theo Tait noting: "In short, ''Cloud Atlas'' spends half its time wanting to be ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and the other half the Bible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From Victorian travelogue to airport thriller|date=1 March 2004|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |author=Tait, Theo|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3613044/From-Victorian-travelogue-to-airport-thriller.html|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linking themes ==
Mitchell has said of the book:

{{Quote|title = |quote = Literally all of the main characters, except one, are [[reincarnation]]s of the same soul in different bodies throughout the novel identified by a birthmark ... that's just a symbol really of the universality of [[human nature]]. The title itself ''Cloud Atlas'', the cloud refers to the ever changing manifestations of the Atlas, which is the fixed human nature which is always thus and ever shall be. So the book's theme is predacity, the way individuals prey on individuals, groups on groups, nations on nations, tribes on tribes. So I just take this theme and in a sense reincarnate that theme in another context&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/bookclub/ram/bookclub_20070603.ram |title=Bookclub |date=June 2007 |access-date=19 April 2008 |publisher=BBC Radio 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Structure and style ==
In an interview, Mitchell stated that the title was inspired by the piece of music of the same name by the Japanese composer [[Toshi Ichiyanagi]]: "I bought the CD just because of that track's beautiful title." Mitchell's previous novel, ''[[number9dream]]'', had also been inspired by a piece of music by [[John Lennon]]; Mitchell has said this fact "pleases me ... though I couldn’t duplicate the pattern indefinitely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6034/the-art-of-fiction-no-204-david-mitchell|title=Paris Review - The Art of Fiction No. 204, David Mitchell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's style was inspired by [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''[[If on a winter's night a traveler]]'', which contains several incomplete, interrupted narratives. Mitchell's innovation was to add a '[[mirror]]' in the centre of his book so that each story could be brought to a conclusion.&lt;ref name="Mullan"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/12/book-club-mitchell-cloud-atlas | title=Guardian book club: Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell| date=12 June 2010 | accessdate=6 August 2010 | work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=John | last=Mullan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17232-2004Aug19.html | title=Washington Post| date=22 August 2004 | accessdate=19 April 2008 | work=The Washington Post | first=Jeff | last=Turrentine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell said that Vyvyan Ayrs and Robert Frobisher were inspired by  English composer [[Frederick Delius]] and his [[amanuensis]] [[Eric Fenby]].&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost" /&gt;

The book contains links to Mitchell's other works. ''The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish'' and ''Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery'' revisit minor characters from his novel ''[[Ghostwritten (novel)|Ghostwritten]]'', and Eva, the daughter of Ayrs in ''Letters from Zedelghem,'' reappears in ''[[Black Swan Green]]'' as an elderly woman befriended by the main character.{{original research inline|date=August 2014}}

==Textual variations==

An academic Martin Paul Eve noticed significant differences in the American and British editions of the book while writing a paper on the book. He noted "an astonishing degree" of variance and that "one of the chapters was almost entirely rewritten".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eve|first=Martin Paul|date=2016-08-10|title="You have to keep track of your changes": The Version Variants and Publishing History of David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas|url=http://doi.org/10.16995/olh.82|journal=Open Library of Humanities|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.16995/olh.82|issn=2056-6700}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mitchell, who authorized both editions, the differences emerged as the US version was not initially edited after an editor left, while Mitchell and his editor and copy editor made changes to the manuscript. However, the changes were not passed on to the US.  When a new US editor also made his own changes,  Mitchell did not apply those changes to the British edition. Mitchell said: "Due to my inexperience at that stage in my three-book ‘career’, it hadn’t occurred to me that having two versions of the same novel appearing on either side of the Atlantic raises thorny questions over which is definitive, so I didn’t go to the trouble of making sure that the American changes were applied to the British version (which was entering production by that point probably) and vice versa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/10/cloud-atlas-astonishingly-different-in-us-and-uk-editions-study-finds |title=Cloud Atlas 'astonishingly different' in US and UK editions, study finds |author=Alison Flood|date= 10 August 2016 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film adaptation ==
{{main|Cloud Atlas (film)}}

The novel was adapted to film by directors [[Tom Tykwer]] and [[the Wachowskis]]. With an ensemble cast to cover the multiple storylines, production began in September 2011 at [[Studio Babelsberg]] in Germany. The film was released in North America on 26 October 2012. In October 2012, Mitchell wrote an article in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' called "Translating 'Cloud Atlas' Into the Language of Film" in which he describes the work of the adapters as being like translating a work into another language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443675404578060870111158076 |title=Translating 'Cloud Atlas' Into the Language of Film |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=David |last=Mitchell |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3928">The '''Commonwealth Literary Fund (CLF)''' was an Australian Government initiative founded in 1908 to assist needy Australian writers and their families. It was Federal Australia's first systematic support for the arts. Its scope was later broadened to encompass non-commercial literary projects.

==History==
In 1908 the [[Alfred Deakin|Deakin]] government established the fund, using Britain's [[Royal Literary Fund]] as a model, appointed a Committee and allocated ₤500 for grants for the first year. Its purpose was to provide a modest income for writers who were doing good work but had inadequate means to support themselves, and for widows and dependent families of writers who died destitute. A committee consisting of Sir [[Langdon Bonython]], the Rev. [[E. H. Sugden]], B.A., master of Queen's College, [[Melbourne University]], and Professor [[Mungo William MacCallum|Mungo McCallum]], M.A., [[Challis Professor]] of Modern Literature at the [[University of Sydney]], formed the committee which framed its regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5057976 |title=A Literary Fund |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |volume=XLIX, |issue=15,097 |location=South Australia |date=8 March 1907 |accessdate=16 March 2016 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the Fund, which had increased incrementally to ₤1500, was trebled by the government in response to agitation by the [[Fellowship of Australian Writers]] and ex-Prime Minister [[Jim Scullin]]. The scope of the Fund was broadened to grant [[scholarship|fellowship]]s to writers, and to provide guarantees against loss to Australian publishers of works approved by the Committee. It also provided assistance to Australian literary magazines ''[[Meanjin]]'', ''[[Overland (magazine)|Overland]]'', ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'' and ''[[Southerly (journal)|Southerly]]''. The Committee was replaced by a Board comprising the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and one other, with an Advisory Board comprising leading writers, publishers and academics, which in practice was responsible for all decisions and disbursements.&lt;ref name=Dunlevy&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110683348 |title=Writers' World: How valuable are fellowships? |author=Dunlevy, Maurice |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=46, |issue=12,949 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=23 October 1971 |accessdate=16 March 2016 |page=14 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership of the Advisory Board was generally confined to older (mostly) male writers of long-established reputations: [[Grenfell Price]], [[Vance Palmer]], [[T. Inglis Moore]], [[Douglas Stewart (poet)|Douglas Stewart]], [[Geoffrey Blainey]], [[Kenneth Slessor]], [[Flora Eldershaw]] and [[Kylie Tennant]].
Maurice Dunlevy, in his article for the Canberra Times, echoed Grenfell Price in saying that the Fund may have enabled works to be published which otherwise would not have been written, or would have been of lesser quality, and helped in the careers of a few great writers ([[Les A. Murray]], [[David Ireland (author)|David Ireland]], [[Alex Buzo]], [[William Leonard Marshall|William Marshall]], [[H. M. Green]], and [[Judith Wright]]), but much of the work produced was of mediocre quality, and no book sponsored by the Fund could be called a work of genius.&lt;ref name=Dunlevy/&gt;

In 1973, by which time its budget had grown to $300,000, the functions of the CLF were taken over by the Literature Board, an arm of the [[Australia Council for the Arts]].

'''''Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening''''' (1944) is a [[Surrealism|surrealist]] painting by [[Salvador Dalí]]. A short, alternate title for the painting is '''''Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee'''''. It was painted in 1944, while Dalí and his wife, [[Gala Dalí|Gala]], were living in America.&lt;ref name=fulcrum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulcrumgallery.com/Salvador-Dali/Dream-Caused-by-the-Flight-of-a-Bee-Around-a-Pomegranate-A-Second-Before-Awakening_24430.htm|title=Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate, A Second Before Awakening|publisher=Fulcrum Gallery|accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

In this "hand-painted dream photograph", as Dalí generally called his paintings, there is a seascape of distant horizons and calm waters, perhaps [[Port Lligat]], amidst which Gala is the subject of the scene. Next to the naked body of the sleeping woman, which levitates above a flat rock that floats above the sea, Dalí depicts two suspended droplets of water and a [[pomegranate]], a Christian symbol of fertility and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Peter|title=A Dictionary Of Christian Art (Oxford Paperback Reference)|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location="Pomegranate"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above the pomegranate flies a bee, an insect that traditionally symbolizes the Virgin.&lt;ref name="World History Of Beekeeping"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crane|first=Eva|title=The World History OF Beekeeping And Honey Hunting|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-92467-2|pages=600–610|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ANTSvKj1AZEC&amp;pg=PA605&amp;dq=bee+christian+virginity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fMa5TdLvFtS_gQe63eET&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bee%20christian%20virginity&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the upper left of the painting what seems to be a [[yelloweye rockfish]] bursts out of the pomegranate, and in turn spews out a tiger that then spews out another tiger and a rifle with a bayonet that is about to sting Gala in the arm. Above them is Dalí's first use of an elephant with long flamingo legs, found in his later compositions such as ''[[The Temptation of St. Anthony (Dalí)|The Temptation of St. Anthony]]''. The elephant carries on its back an obelisk, inspired by Bernini’s ''[[Elephant and Obelisk]]'' in Rome's Piazza [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dahlberg|first=Kristina|title=Bernini's Little Chick|url=http://honorsaharchive.blogspot.com/2007/02/berninis-elephant-obelisk-pulcino-della.html|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thyssen&gt;{{cite web|last=Thyssen|first=Museo|title=Permanent Collection|url=http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/ficha_obra/352|work=Museo Thyssen Permanent Collection|publisher=Museo Thyssen|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and symbolism==

The bayonet, as a symbol of the [[Bee sting|stinging bee]], may represent the woman's abrupt awakening from her otherwise peaceful dream. This is  an example of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s influence on surrealist art and Dalí's attempts to explore the world of [[dream]]s in a dreamscape.&lt;ref name=fulcrum /&gt;

The elephant is a distorted version of the [[Piazza della Minerva]] sculpture ''[[Elephant and Obelisk]]'' by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] facing the church of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] in Rome.&lt;ref name=Leroy&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBZbhP3rW-YC&amp;pg=RA1-PA44&amp;lpg=RA1-cioooo |title=Surrealism|year=2004|author=Cathrin Klingsöhr-Leroy|accessdate=2008-01-08 | isbn=978-3-8228-2215-9 | publisher=Taschen}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--publisher=TaschenISBN=3822822159--&gt; The smaller pomegranate floating between two droplets of water may symbolize Venus, especially because of the heart-shaped shadow it casts.&lt;ref name=Leroy /&gt; It may also be used as a Christian symbol of fertility and resurrection.&lt;ref name=Paloma /&gt; This female symbolism may contrast with the phallic symbolism of the threatening creatures.&lt;ref name=Leroy /&gt;

It has also been suggested that the painting is "a surrealist interpretation of the [[Theory of Evolution]]."&lt;ref name=ijdb&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/contents.php?vol=47&amp;issue=7-8|title=Evolution &amp; Development|year=2003|author=Jaume Baguñà and Jordi García-Fernández|journal=The International Journal of Developmental Biology|accessdate=2012-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819224327/http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/contents.php?vol=47&amp;issue=7-8|archivedate=2012-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Dalí said this painting was intended "to express for the first time in images [[Freud]]'s discovery of the typical dream with a lengthy narrative, the consequence of the instantaneousness of a chance event which causes the sleeper to wake up. Thus, as a bar might fall on the neck of a sleeping person, causing them to wake up and for a long dream to end with the guillotine blade falling on them, the noise of the bee here provokes the sensation of the sting which will awaken Gala."&lt;ref name=Paloma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museothyssen.org/thyssen_ing/coleccion/obras_ficha_texto388.html|title=Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee around a Pomegranate a Second before Waking up|author=Paloma Alarcó|publisher=Museo de Arte Thyssen-Bornemisza|accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guillotine anecdote refers to a dream reported by [[Alfred Maury]] in ''[[Le sommeil et les rêves]]'' ("Sleep and Dreams") and related by Freud in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1484">The '''Eadred Reliquary''' was one of the wide-ranging [[Art forgery|art forgeries]] produced by [[Shaun Greenhalgh]] and his family, of [[Bolton, Greater Manchester]].

Shaun, who had crafted the object, intended it to resemble a known missing Anglo-Saxon piece, dating back to the time of [[Eadred]], the [[King of England]] from 946 to 955.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16961">[[Image:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A traveller puts his head under the edge of the [[firmament]] in the original (1888) printing of the Flammarion engraving.]]

The '''Flammarion engraving''' is a [[wood engraving]] by an unknown artist, so named because its first documented appearance is in [[Camille Flammarion]]'s 1888 book ''L'atmosphère: météorologie populaire'' ("The Atmosphere: Popular Meteorology").&lt;ref name="Flammarion"&gt;{{cite book| first=Camille | last=Flammarion | authorlink=Camille Flammarion | title=L'atmosphère: météorologie populaire | location=Paris | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ScDVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA163 | publisher=Hachette | year= 1888 | page=163 }} The text is also available [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k408619m here].&lt;/ref&gt; The engraving has often, but erroneously, been referred to as a [[woodcut]]. It has been used to represent a supposedly medieval cosmology, including a [[flat earth]] bounded by a solid and opaque sky, or [[firmament]], and also as a metaphorical illustration of either the [[Science|scientific]] or the [[Mysticism|mystical]] quests for knowledge. 

In fact, even in the Early Middle Ages, almost all Christian scholars agreed the Earth was round, not flat (see [[Myth of the flat Earth]]), though until the [[Copernican Revolution]] of the 1500s, they still believed in a [[geocentric model]] with the Earth at the center of the Universe.

==Description==
The engraving depicts a man, clothed in a long robe and carrying a staff, who is at the edge of the Earth, where it meets the sky. He kneels down and passes his head, shoulders, and right arm through the star-studded sky, discovering a marvellous realm of circling clouds, fires and suns beyond the heavens. One of the elements of the cosmic machinery bears a strong resemblance to traditional pictorial representations of the "[[Ophanim|wheel in the middle of a wheel]]" described in the visions of the Hebrew prophet [[Ezekiel]]. The caption that accompanies the engraving in Flammarion's book reads: {{quote|A missionary of the Middle Ages tells that he had found the point where the sky and the Earth touch...&lt;ref name="Flammarion" /&gt;}}

== Attribution ==
In 1957, [[Astronomy|astronomer]] [[Ernst Zinner]] claimed that the image dated to the [[German Renaissance]], but he was unable to find any version published earlier than 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Zinner, in ''Börsenblatt für den Deutschen Buchhandel'', Frankfurt, 18 March 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Further investigation, however, revealed that the work was a composite of images characteristic of different historical periods, and that it had been made with a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], a tool used for [[wood engraving]] only since the late 18th century. The image was traced to Flammarion's book by [[Arthur Beer]], an astrophysicist and historian of German science at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and, independently, by Bruno Weber, the curator of rare books at the [[Zürich]] central library.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Weber, "Ubi caelum terrae se coniungit: Ein altertümlicher Aufriß des Weltgebäudes von Camille Flammarion", ''[[Gutenberg-Jahrbuch]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;381-408 (1973) [http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/resolveppn/?PID=GDZPPN000484709 online link].&lt;/ref&gt;

Flammarion had been apprenticed at the age of twelve to an engraver in [[Paris]] and it is believed that many of the illustrations for his books were engraved from his own drawings, probably under his supervision. Therefore, it is plausible that Flammarion himself created the image, though the evidence for this remains inconclusive. Like most other illustrations in Flammarion's books, the engraving carries no attribution. Although sometimes referred to as a forgery or a hoax, Flammarion does not characterize the engraving as a medieval or renaissance woodcut, and the mistaken interpretation of the engraving as an older work did not occur until after Flammarion's death. The decorative border surrounding the engraving is distinctly non-medieval and it was only by cropping it that the confusion about the historical origins of the image became possible.

According to Bruno Weber and to astronomer [[Joseph Ashbrook]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Ashbrook, "Astronomical Scrapbook: About an Astronomical Woodcut," ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]'', '''53''' (5), pp. 356-407, May 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; the depiction of a spherical heavenly vault separating the earth from an outer realm is similar to the first illustration in [[Sebastian Münster]]'s ''[[Cosmographia (Sebastian Münster)|Cosmographia]]'' of 1544,&lt;ref&gt;The image is shown [http://www.istitutodatini.it/biblio/images/it/lazzer/munster/dida/dida2.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; a book which Flammarion, an ardent bibliophile and book collector, might have owned.

== Context in Flammarion's book ==

In Flammarion's ''L'atmosphère: météorologie populaire'', the image refers to the text on the facing page (p.&amp;nbsp;162), which also clarifies the author's intent in using it as an illustration:

{{quote|Whether the sky be clear or cloudy, it always seems to us to have the shape of an elliptic arch; far from having the form of a circular arch, it always seems flattened and depressed above our heads, and gradually to become farther removed toward the horizon. Our ancestors imagined that this blue vault was really what the eye would lead them to believe it to be; but, as [[Voltaire]] remarks, this is about as reasonable as if a silk-worm took his web for the limits of the universe. The Greek astronomers represented it as formed of a solid crystal substance; and so recently as [[Copernicus]], a large number of astronomers thought it was as solid as plate-glass. The Latin poets placed the divinities of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] and the stately mythological court upon this vault, above the planets and the fixed stars. Previous to the knowledge that the earth was moving in space, and that space is everywhere, theologians had installed the Trinity in the [[empyrean]], the glorified body of Jesus, that of the Virgin Mary, the [[Christian angelic hierarchy|angelic hierarchy]], the saints, and all the heavenly host.... A naïve missionary of the Middle Ages even tells us that, in one of his voyages in search of the [[Garden of Eden|terrestrial paradise]], he reached the horizon where the earth and the heavens met, and that he discovered a certain point where they were not joined together, and where, by stooping his shoulders, he passed under the roof of the heavens...&lt;ref name="Glaisher"&gt;{{cite book| first=Camille | last=Flammarion | authorlink=Camille Flammarion | title=The Atmosphere | location=New York | year= 1873 | page=103 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iGYAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The same paragraph had already appeared, ''without'' the accompanying engraving, in an earlier edition of the text published under the title of ''L'atmosphère: description des grands phénomènes de la Nature'' ("The Atmosphere: Description of the Great Phenomena of Nature," 1872).&lt;ref name="Phenomenes"&gt;{{cite book| first=Camille | last=Flammarion | authorlink=Camille Flammarion | title=L'atmosphère: description des grands phénomènes de la Nature | location=Paris | year= 1872 | page=138 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDwAAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correspondence between the text and the illustration is so close that one would appear to be based on the other. Had Flammarion known of the engraving in 1872, it seems unlikely that he would have left it out of that year's edition, which was already heavily illustrated. The more probable conclusion therefore is that Flammarion commissioned the engraving specifically to illustrate this particular text, though this has not been ascertained conclusively.

==Literary sources==

The idea of the contact of a solid sky with the earth is one that repeatedly appears in Flammarion's earlier works. In his ''Les mondes imaginaires et les mondes réels'' ("Imaginary Worlds and Real Worlds," 1864), he cites a legend of a Christian saint, Macarius the Roman, which he dates to the 6th century. This legend includes the story of three monks (Theophilus, Sergius, and Hyginus) who "wished to discover the point where the sky and the earth touch"&lt;ref name="Mondes"&gt;{{cite book| first=Camille | last=Flammarion | authorlink=Camille Flammarion | title=Les mondes imaginaires et les mondes réels | location=Paris | year=1865 | page=246 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDMJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA246#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in Latin: ''ubi cœlum terræ se conjungit'').&lt;ref name="Vitae"&gt;{{cite book| title=De Vitis Patrum Liber Primus | location=Paris | year=1860 | page=415 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePYUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PT98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; After recounting the legend&lt;ref&gt;The legend of St. Macarius may be read in English translation at [http://www.vitae-patrum.org.uk/page33.html ''Vitae Patrum''].&lt;/ref&gt; he remarks that "the preceding monks hoped to go to heaven without leaving the earth, to find 'the place where the sky and the earth touch,' and open the mysterious gateway which separates this world from the other. Such is the cosmographical notion of the universe; it is always the terrestrial valley crowned by the canopy of the heavens."

In the legend of St. Macarius, the monks do not in fact find the place where earth and sky touch. In ''Les mondes imaginaires'' Flammarion recounts another story:

{{quote|This fact reminds us of the tale which Le Vayer recounts in his ''Letters''. It appears that an [[anchorite]], probably a relative of the Desert Fathers of the East, boasted of having been as far as the end of the world, and of having been obliged ''to stoop his shoulders'', on account of the joining of the sky and the earth in that distant place.&lt;ref name="Mondes2"&gt;{{cite book| first=Camille | last=Flammarion | authorlink=Camille Flammarion | title=Les mondes imaginaires et les mondes réels | location=Paris | year=1865 | page=328 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDMJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA328#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Flammarion also mentioned the same story, in nearly the same words, in his ''Histoire du Ciel'' ("History of the Sky"):

{{quote|"I have in my library," interrupted the deputy, "a very curious work: Levayer's letters. I recall having read there of a good anchorite who bragged of having been 'to the ends of the earth,' and of having been obliged to stoop his shoulders, because of the union of the sky and of the earth at this extremity."&lt;ref name="Ciel"&gt;{{cite book| first=Camille | last=Flammarion | authorlink=Camille Flammarion | title=Histoire du Ciel | location=Paris | year=1872 | page=299 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZsOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=ciel%20terre%20%C3%A9paules%20Flammarion&amp;pg=PA299#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Letters'' referred to are a series of short essays by [[François de La Mothe Le Vayer]]. In letter 89, Le Vayer, after mentioning [[Strabo]]'s scornful opinion of [[Pytheas]]'s account of a region in the far north where land, sea, and air seemed to mingle in a single gelatinous substance, adds:

{{quote|That good anchorite, who boasted of having been as far as the end of the world, said likewise, that he had been obliged to stoop low, on account of the joining of the sky and earth in that distant region.&lt;ref name="Levayer"&gt;{{cite book| first=François | last=de La Mothe Le Vayer | title=Oeuvres de François de La Mothe Le Vayer, Volume 3 | location=Paris | year=1662 | page=777 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jj0_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA777#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Le Vayer does not specify who this "anchorite" was, nor does he provide further details about the story or its sources. Le Vayer's comment was expanded upon by Pierre Estève in his ''Histoire generale et particuliere de l'astronomie'' ("General and Particular History of Astronomy," 1755), where he interprets Le Vayer's statement (without attribution) as a claim that Pytheas "had arrived at a corner of the sky, and was obliged to stoop down in order not to touch it."&lt;ref name="Esteve"&gt;{{cite book| first=Pierre | last=Estève | title=Histoire generale et particuliere de l'astronomie | location=Paris | year=1755 | page=242 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4CAuAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA142#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of the story of St. Macarius with Le Vayer's remarks seems to be due to Flammarion himself. It also appears in his ''Les terres du ciel'' ("The Lands of the Sky"):

{{quote|With respect to the bounds (of the Earth)... some monks of the tenth century of our era, bolder than the rest, say that, in making a voyage in search of the terrestrial paradise, they had found the point where the heaven and earth touch, and had even been obliged to lower their shoulders!&lt;ref name="Terres"&gt;{{cite book| first=Camille | last=Flammarion | authorlink=Camille Flammarion | title=Les terres du ciel | location=Paris | year=1884 | page=395 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efnH7h33qmYC&amp;pg=PA395#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Later uses and interpretations ==
[[File:Flammarion Colored.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A modern colorized version of the engraving.]]
The Flammarion engraving appeared in [[C. G. Jung]]'s ''Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies'' (1959). The first color version to be published was made by [[Roberta Weir]] and distributed by Berkeley's [[Print Mint]] in 1970.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} That color image spawned most of the modern variations that have followed since.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} [[Donovan]]'s 1973 LP, ''[[Cosmic Wheels]]'', used an extended black and white version on its inner sleeve (an artist added elements extending the image to fit the proportions of the record jacket). The image also appeared in "The Compleat Astrologer" (pg. 25) by Derek and [[Julia Parker (astrologer)|Julia Parker]] in 1971.

The Flammarion engraving appeared on the cover of [[Daniel J. Boorstin]]'s bestselling history of science ''[[The Discoverers]]'', published in 1983. Other books devoted to science that used it as an illustration include ''[[The Mathematical Experience]]'' (1981) by [[Philip J. Davis]] and [[Reuben Hersh]], ''Matter, Space, and Motion: Theories in Antiquity and Their Sequel'' (1988) by [[Richard Sorabji]], ''Paradoxes of Free Will'' (2002) by [[Gunther Stent]], and ''Uncentering the Earth: Copernicus and On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres'' (2006) by [[William T. Vollmann]]. Some books devoted to mysticism which have also used the engraving include ''Love and Law'' (2001) by [[Ernest Holmes]], ''Gnosticism: New Light on the Ancient Tradition of Inner Knowing'' (2002) by [[Stephan A. Hoeller]], and ''Practical Astrology'' (2008) by Priscilla Costello.

The image was reproduced on the title page of the score of [[Brian Ferneyhough]]'s "Transit: Six Solo Voices and Chamber Orchestra", published by Edition Peters in 1975.

An interpretation of the image was used for the animated sequence about the cosmological vision of [[Giordano Bruno]] in the March 9, 2014 premiere of the TV series ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'', hosted by the astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]]. That TV series was dedicated to the popularization of science and astronomy, as had Flammarion's own work 150 years before.

In the German-language video series "Von Aristoteles zur Stringtheorie", ("From Aristotle to String Theory"), which is hosted on YouTube and produced by Urknall, Weltall, und das Leben&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.urknall-weltall-leben.de/|website=Urknall, Weltall und das Leben}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and features Professor Joseph Gaßner as lecturer, a colored Flammarion engraving was selected as a logo, but the man is peering at a background filled with the important equations of physics.

Some commentators have claimed that Flammarion produced the image to propagandize the myth that medieval Europeans widely believed the [[Myth of the Flat Earth|Earth to be flat]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.satrakshita.be/earliest_woodcut_source.htm here], and [http://hsci.ou.edu/exhibits/exhibit.php?exbgrp=-999&amp;exbid=45&amp;exbpg=22 here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714013023/http://hsci.ou.edu/exhibits/exhibit.php?exbgrp=-999&amp;exbid=45&amp;exbpg=22 |date=July 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, however, Flammarion never discusses the history of beliefs about the shape of the Earth. His text suggests that the image is simply a fanciful illustration of the false view of the sky as an opaque barrier.

'''Gothic architecture''' is a [[architectural style|style]] that flourished in [[Europe]] during the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages|Late]] [[Middle Ages]]. It evolved from [[Romanesque architecture]] and was succeeded by [[Renaissance architecture]]. Originating in 12th-century [[France]], it was widely used, especially for cathedrals and churches, until the 16th century.

Its most prominent features included the use of the [[rib vault]] and the [[flying buttress]], which allowed the weight of the roof to be counterbalanced by buttresses outside the building, giving greater height and more space for windows.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}} Another important feature was the extensive use of stained glass, and the [[rose window]], to bring light and color to the interior. Another feature was the use of realistic statuary on the exterior, particularly over the portals, to illustrate biblical stories for the largely illiterate parishioners. These technologies had all existed in [[Romanesque architecture]], but they were used in more innovative ways and more extensively in Gothic architecture to make buildings taller, lighter and stronger.

The first notable example is generally considered to be the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]], near Paris, whose choir and facade were reconstructed with Gothic features. The choir was completed in 1144. The style also appeared in some civic architecture in northern Europe, notably in town halls and university buildings. A [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] began in mid-18th-century England, spread through 19th century Europe and continued, largely for ecclesiastical and university structures, into the 20th century.

==Name==
Gothic architecture was known during the period as {{lang|la|opus francigenum}} ("French/[[Franks|Frankish]] work"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Colin|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVNGNIojGgMC&amp;pg=PA90|date=28 May 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66992-4|page=90|quote=The style was widely referred to as {{lang|la|opus francigenum}} - "[[Franks]]' work".}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Gothic architecture" originated in the 16th century, and was originally very negative, suggesting barbaric. [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term "barbarous German style" in his 1550 ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' to describe what is now considered the Gothic style,{{sfn|Vasari|1991|pp=117, 527}} and in the introduction to the ''Lives'' he attributed various architectural features to "[[Goths|the Goths]]" whom he held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered [[Rome]], and erecting new ones in this style.{{sfn|Vasari|Brown|Maclehose|1907|p=83}}

==History==
===Origins – Early Gothic (1130–1200)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Gothic style originated in the [[Ile-de-France]] region of northern France in the first half of the 12th century. A new dynasty of French Kings, the [[Capetians]], had subdued the feudal lords, and had become the most powerful rulers in France, with their capital in Paris. They allied themselves with the bishops of the major cities of northern France, and reduced the power of the feudal abbots and monasteries. Their rise coincided with an enormous growth of the population and prosperity of the cities of northern France. The Capetian Kings and their bishops wished to build new cathedrals as monuments of their power, wealth, and religious faith.{{sfn|Raeburn|1980|p=102}}

The church which served as the primary model for the style was the [[Abbey of St-Denis]], which underwent reconstruction by the Abbot [[Suger]], first in the choir and then the facade (1140–44), Suger was a close ally and biographer of the French King, [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], who was a fervent Catholic and builder, and the founder of the [[University of Paris]]. Suger remodeled the ambulatory of the Abbey, removed the enclosures that separated the chapels, and replaced the existing structure with imposing pillars and [[rib vault]]s. This created created higher and wider bays, into which he installed larger windows, which filled the end of the church with light. Soon afterwards he rebuilt the facade, adding three deep portals, each with a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], an arch filled with sculpture illustrating biblical stories. The new facade was flanked by two towers. He also installed a small circular [[rose window]] over the central portal. This design became the prototype for a series of new French cathedrals.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=17–18}}

[[Sens Cathedral]] (begun between 1135 and 1140) was the first Cathedral to be built in the new style (St. Denis was an abbey, not a Cathedral). Other versions of the new style soon appeared in [[Noyon Cathedral]] (begun 1150); [[Laon Cathedral]] (begun 1165); and the most famous of all, [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], where construction had begun in 1160.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=20–22}}

The Gothic style was also adapted by some French monastic orders, notably the [[Cistercian]] order under [[Saint Bernard of Clairvaux]] It was used in an austere form without ornament at the new Cistercian [[Abbey of Fontenay]] (1139–1147) and the church of [[Clairvaux Abbey]], whose site is now occupied by a French prison.{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=24–26}}

The new style was also copied outside the Kingdom of France in the [[Duchy of Normandy]]. Early examples of Norman Gothic included [[Coutances Cathedral]] (1210–1274); [[Bayeux Cathedral]] (rebuilt from Romanesque style in 12th century), [[Le Mans Cathedral]] (rebuilt from Romanesque 12th century) and [[Rouen Cathedral]]. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to [[England]] and spread from there to [[Low Countries]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]], northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].{{sfn|Ducher|1988|page=46}}{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=36}} The Gothic style did not immediately replace the Romanesque everywhere in Europe.{{sfn|Raeburn|1980|p=102}} The Late Romanesque continued to flourish in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] under the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufens]] and [[Rhineland]].

===High Gothic (1200–1270)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
From the end of the 12th century until the middle of the 13th century, the gothic style spread from the Île-de-France to appear in other cities of northern France. New structures in the style included [[Chartres Cathedral]] (begun 1200); [[Bourges Cathedral]] (1195 to 1230), [[Reims Cathedral]] (1211–1275), and [[Amiens Cathedral]] (begun 1250);{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=48}} At Chartres, the use of the flying buttresses allowed the elimination of the tribune level, which allowed much higher arcades and nave, and larger windows. The early type of [[rib vault]] used of Saint Denis and Notre Dame, with six parts, was modified to four parts, making it simpler and stronger. Amiens and Chartres were among the first to use the [[flying buttress]]; the buttresses were strengthened by an additional arch and with a supporting arcade, allowing even higher and walls and more windows. At Reims, the buttresses were given greater weight and strength by the addition of heavy stone pinnacles on top. These were often decorated with statues of angels, and became an important decorative element of the High Gothic style. Another practical and decorative element, the gargoyle, appeared; it was an ornamental rain spout which channeled the water from the roof away from the building. At Amiens, the windows of the nave were made larger, and an additional row of clear glass windows (the claire-voie) flooded the interior with light. The new structural technologies allowed the enlargement of the transepts and of the choirs at the east end of the cathedrals, creating the space for a ring of well-lit chapels. The transept of Notre-Dame was rebuilt with the new technology, and two spectacular rose windows added.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=48}}

===Rayonnant Gothic (1250–1370s)===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200"&gt;

File:Rose du transept Sud Notre-Dame de Paris 170208 04.jpg|Exterior of south rose window of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] (about 1250)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The next period was termed ''[[Rayonnant]]'' ("Radiant"), describing the tendency toward the use of more and more stained glass and less masonry in the design of the structure, until the walls seemed entirely made of glass. The most celebrated example was the chapel of [[Sainte-Chapelle]], the chapel attached to the royal residence on the [[Palais de la Cité]]. An elaborate system of exterior columns and arches reduced the walls of the upper chapel to a thin framework for the enormous windows. The weight of each of the masonry gables above the [[archivolt]] of the windows also helped the walls to resist the thrust and to distribute the weight.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=58}}

Another landmark of the Rayonnant Gothic are the two rose windows on the north and south of the transept of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]. Whereas earlier rose windows, like those of [[Amiens Cathedral]], were framed by stone and occupied only a portion of the wall, these two windows, with a delicate lace-like framework, occupied the entire space between the pillars.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=58}}

===Flamboyant Gothic (1350–1550)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[Flamboyant]] Gothic style appeared in the second half of the 14th century. Its characteristic features were more exuberant decoration, as the nobles and wealthy citizens of mostly northern French cities competed to build more and more elaborate churches and cathedrals. It took its name from the sinuous, flame-like designs which ornamented windows. Other new features included the ''arc en accolade'', a window decorated with an arch, stone pinnacles and floral sculpture. It also featured an increase in the number of ''nervures'', or ribs, that supported and decorated each vault of the ceiling, both for greater support and decorative effect. Notable examples of Flamboyant Gothic include the western facade of [[Rouen Cathedral]] and [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] in Paris, both built in the 1370s; and the Choir of [[Mont Saint Michel Abbey]] (1448 c.).{{sfn|Renault|Lazé|2006|p=37}} Subsequently, the style spread to Northern Europe. Notable example of Flamboyant Gothic in the Baltic region includes the [[Brick Gothic]] [[Church of St. Anne, Vilnius|Church of St. Anne]] in [[Vilnius]] (1490s).

File:Coupe.nef.eglise.Saint.Denis.png|Cross section of the nave wall and buttresses of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The plan of the Gothic cathedral was based on the model of the ancient Roman [[basilica]], which was a combined public market and courthouse; which was also the basis of the plan of the Romanesque cathedral. The cathedral is in the form of a Latin cross. The entrance is traditionally on the west end, has three portals decorated with sculpture, usually a rose window, and is flanked by two towers. The long nave, where the congregation worshiped, occupies the west end. This is usually divided from the nave by rows of pillars, which support the roof, flanked by one or two aisles, called ''collaérals''. There are usually small chapels on the two sides, placed between the buttresses, which provide additional support to the walls.

The cathedral usually has a [[transept]], a crossing, roughly in the middle, which sometimes projects outwards some distance, and in other cases, such as Notre-Dame, is minimal. The ''croisée'' or crossing of the transept, is the center of the church, and is surrounded by particularly massive pillars, which sometimes support a lantern tower, which brings light into the center of the cathedral. The north and south facades of the transept often feature rose windows, as at [[Notre Dame de Paris]].

To the east of the transept is the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], where the altar is located, where ceremonies take place, and where only the clergy was allowed. This space grew greatly in the 12th century, as ceremonies became more elaborate. Behind the choir is single or double a walkway called the [[ambulatory]]. At the eastern end of the church is the [[apse]] usually in the form of a half-circle, and the chevet. There is usually a chapel here dedicated to the Virgin Mary, which can be very large. Around chevet there are usually several other smaller chapels.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=18–19}}

The earlier Gothic cathedrals had four levels, from the floor to the roof. On the ground floor there were two rows grand arcades with large pillars, which received the weight of the vaults of the ceiling. Above these were the tribunes, a section of arched openings, giving more support. Above these was the ''triforium'', a section of small arches. On the top level, just below the vaults, were the upper windows, the main source of light for the Cathedral.The lower walls were supported by massive ''contreforts'' or buttresses placed directly up against them, with pinnacles on top which provided additional weight.

Later, with the development of the flying buttress, the supports moved further away from the walls, and the walls were built much higher. Gradually the tribunes and the triforium disappeared, and the walls above the arcades were occupied almost entirely with stained glass.{{sfn|Renault|Lazé|2006|p=33}}

The eastern arm shows considerable diversity. In England it is generally long and may have two distinct sections, both choir and presbytery. It is often square ended or has a projecting ''Lady Chapel'', dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]]. In France the eastern end is often polygonal and surrounded by a walkway called an [[ambulatory]] and sometimes a ring of chapels called a "[[chevet]]". While German churches are often similar to those of France, in Italy, the eastern projection beyond the transept is usually just a shallow apsidal chapel containing the sanctuary, as at [[Florence Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Swaan&gt;Wim Swaan, ''The Gothic Cathedral''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another characteristic feature of the Gothic style, domestic and ecclesiastical alike, is the division of interior space into individual cells according to the building's ribbing and vaults, regardless of whether or not the structure actually has a vaulted ceiling. This system of cells of varying size and shape juxtaposed in various patterns was again totally unique to antiquity and the [[Early Middle Ages]] and scholars, Frankl included, have emphasised the mathematical and geometric nature of this design. Frankl in particular thought of this layout as "creation by division" rather than the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]'s "creation by addition." Others, namely [[Viollet-le-Duc]], [[Wilhelm Pinder]], and [[August Schmarsow]], instead proposed the term "articulated architecture."{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=14}} The opposite theory as suggested by [[Henri Focillon]] and [[Jean Bony]] is of "spacial unification", or of the creation of an interior that is made for sensory overload via the interaction of many elements and perspectives.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|pp=14, 17}} Interior and exterior partitions, often extensively studied, have been found to at times contain features, such as thoroughfares at window height, that make the illusion of thickness. Additionally, the [[pier (architecture)|pier]]s separating the isles eventually stopped being part of the walls but rather independent objects that jut out from the actual aisle wall itself.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=17}}

===The pointed arch and the rib vault===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Both the pointed arch and the rib vault had been used in [[romanesque architecture]], but Gothic builders refined them and used them to much greater effect. They made the structures lighter and stronger, and thus allowed the great heights and expanses of stained glass found in Gothic cathedrals.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=46}}

In Romanesque architecture, the rounded arches of the barrel vaults that supported the roof pressed directly down on the walls with crushing weight. This required massive columns, thick walls and small windows, and naturally limited the height of the building. The pointed or broken arch, introduced during the Romanesque period, was stronger, lighter, and carried the thrust outwards, rather than directly downwards.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=46}}

The rib vault took advantage of the strength of the pointed arch. The vault was supported by thin ribs or arches of stone, which reached downwards and outwards to cluster around supporting pillars along the inside of the walls. The earlier rib vaults, used at Notre Dame, Noyon, and Laon, were divided by the ribs into six compartments, and could only cross a limited space. In later cathedral construction, the design was improved, and the rib vaults had only four compartments, and could cover a wider span; a single vault could cross the nave, and fewer pillars were needed. The four-part vault was used at Amiens, Reims, and the other later cathedrals, and eventually at cathedrals across Europe.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=46}}

In the later period of the Gothic style, the rib vaults lost their elegant simplicity, and were loaded with additional ribs, sculptural designs, and sometimes pendants and other purely decorative elements.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=46}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Another important feature of Gothic architecture was the [[flying buttress]], designed to support the walls by means of arches connected to counter-supports outside the walls. Flying buttresses had existed in simple forms since Roman times, but the Gothic builders raised their use to a fine art, balancing the thrust from the roof inside against the counter-thrust of the buttresses. The earliest Gothic cathedrals, including Saint-Denis and Notre-Dame in its beginning stages, did not have flying buttresses. Their walls were supported by heavy stone abutments placed directly against the walls, The roof was supported by the ribs of the vaults, which were bundled with the columns below.

In the later 12th and early 13th century, the buttresses became more sophisticated. New arches carried the thrust of the weight entirely outside the walls, where it was met by the counter-thrust of stone columns, with pinnacles placed on top for decoration and for additional weight. Thanks to this system of external buttresses, the walls could be higher and thinner, and could support larger stained glass windows. The buttresses themselves became part of the decoration; the pinnacles became more and more ornate, becoming more and more elaborate, as at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]]. The arches had an additional practical purpose; they contained lead channels which carried rain water off the roof; it was expelled from the mouths of stone [[gargoyles]] placed in rows on the buttresses.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=50–51}}

In the late Gothic periods the buttresses became extremely ornate, with a large amount of non-functional decoration in the form of pinnacles, curving arches, counter-curves, statuary and ornamental pendants.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

An important characteristic of Gothic church architecture is its height, both absolute and in proportion to its width, the verticality suggesting an aspiration to Heaven. The increasing height of cathedrals over the Gothic period was accompanied by an increasing proportion of the wall devoted to windows, until, by the late Gothic, the interiors became like cages of glass. This was made possible by the development of the flying buttress, which transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof to the supports outside the walls. As a result, the walls gradually became thinner and higher, and masonry was replaced with glass. The four-part elevation of the naves of early Cathedrals such as Notre-Dame (arcade, tribune, triforium, claire-voie) was transformed in the choir of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] to very tall arcades, a thin triforium, and soaring windows up to the roof.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|page=108}}

Beauvais Cathedral reached the limit of what was possible with Gothic technology. A portion of the choir collapsed in 1284, causing alarm in all of the cities with very tall cathedrals. Panels of experts were created in Sienna and Chartres to study the stability of those structures.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=86}} Only the transept and choir of Beauvais were completed, and in the 21st century the transept walls were reinforced with cross-beams. No cathedral built since exceeded the height of the choir of Beauvais.{{Sfn|Wenzler|2018|page=108}}

A section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide. In England the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at [[Cologne Cathedral]] with a ratio of 3.6:1. The highest internal vault is at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

One of the most prominent features of Gothic architecture was the use of stained glass window, which steadily grew in height and size and filled cathedrals with light and color. Historians including Viollet-le-Duc, Focillon, Aubert, and [[Max Dvořák]] contended that this is one of the most universal features of the Gothic style.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}}

Religious teachings in the Middle Ages, particularly the writings of Religious [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a 6th-century mystic whose book, ''[[The Celestial Hierarchy]]'', was popular among monks in France, taught that all light was divine. When the Abbot [[Suger]] ordered the reconstruction of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], he instructed that the windows in the choir admit as much light as possible.

Many earlier Romanesque churches had stained glass windows, and many had round windows, called ''oculi'', but these windows were necessarily small, due to the thickness of the walls. The primary interior decorations of Romanesque cathedrals were painted murals. In the Gothic period, the improvements in rib vaults and flying buttresses allowed Cathedral walls to be higher, thinner and stronger, and windows were consequently considerably larger, The windows of churches in the late Gothic period, such as [[Sainte Chapelle]] in Paris, filled the entire wall between the ribs of stone. Enormous windows were also an important element of [[York Minster]] and [[Gloucester Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=Swaan/&gt;

The main threat to cathedral windows was the wind; frames had to be extremely strong. The early windows were fit into openings cut into the stone. The small pieces of colored glass were joined together with pieces of lead, and then their surfaces were painted with faces and other details. and then the windows were mounted in the stone frames. Thin vertical and horizontal bars of iron, called ''vergettes'' or ''barlotierres'', were placed inside the window to reinforce the glass.

The stories told in the glass were usually episodes from the Bible, but they also sometimes illustrated the professions of the guilds which had funded the windows, such as the drapers, stonemasons or the barrel-makers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}

Much of the stained glass in Gothic cathedrals today dates from later restorations, but a few cathedrals, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Bourges Cathedral]], still have many of their original windows.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}

===Portals and the tympanum===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Early Gothic Cathedrals traditionally have their main entrance at the western end of the church, opposite the choir. Based on the model of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] and [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], there are usually three doorways with pointed arches, richly filled with sculpture. The [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], or arch, over each doorway is filled with realistic statues illustrating biblical stories, and the columns between the doors are often also crowded with statuary. Following the example of Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal traditionally depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.{{sfn|Renault|Lazé|2006|p=35}}

The iconography of the sculptural decoration on the facade was not left to the artists. An edict of the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 had set the rules: "The composition of religious images is not to be left to the inspiration of artists; it is derived from the principles put in place by the Catholic Church and religious tradition. Only the art belongs to the artist; the composition belongs to the Fathers."{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=79}}

The portals and interiors were much more colorful than they are today. Each sculpture on the tympanum and in the interior was painted by the ''peintre imagier'', or image painter, following a system of colors codified in the 12th century; yellow, called ''gold'', symbolized intelligence, grandeur and virtue; white, called ''argent'', symbolized purity, wisdom, and correctness; black, or ''sable'', meant sadness, but also will; green, or ''sinopole'', represented hope, liberty and joy; red or ''guelues'' meant charity or victory; blue, or ''azure'' symbolized the sky, faithfulness and perseverance; and violet, or ''pourpre'', was the color of royalty and sovereignty.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=54}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The plan for the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] called for two towers of equal height on the west facade, and this general plan was copied at Notre-Dame and most of the early cathedrals. The towers of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], 69 meters (226&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, were intended to be seen throughout the city; they were the tallest towers in Paris until the completion of the [[Eiffel Tower]] in 1889. An informal but vigorous competition began in northern France for the tallest Cathedral towers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=95–98}}

To make the churches taller and more prominent, and visible from a distance, heir builders often added a ''flèche'', a spire usually made of wood and covered with lead, to the top of each tower, or, as in [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], in the center of the transept. Later in the Gothic period, more massive towers were constructed over the transept, rivaling or exceeding in height the towers of the facade.

The towers were usually the last part of the Cathedral to be constructed. They were often built many years or decades after the rest of the building. Sometimes, by the time the towers were built, the plans had changed, or the money had run out. As a result, some Gothic cathedrals had just one tower, or two towers of different heights or styles. On the other hand, [[Laon Cathedral]], begun just before Notre-Dame, boasted five towers; two on the facade, two on the transept, and a central lantern. An additional two were planned but not built. The [[Abbey of Saint-Étienne, Caen]] originally built in the Romanesque style, was rebuilt with nine Gothic towers in the 13th century.

The informal competition for the [[List of tallest church buildings|tallest church in Europe]] went on throughout the Gothic period, sometimes with disastrous results. [[Beauvais Cathedral]] had the tallest tower (153 meters or 502 feet), completed in 1569, for a brief time, until its tower collapsed in the wind in 1573. [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (159.7 meters or 524 feet) also had the record from 1311 until 1549 until its tower also collapsed. Today the tallest cathedral tower in France is [[Rouen Cathedral]], and [[Cologne Cathedral]] (151.0 meters or 495 feet) is the tallest cathedral in Europe.

The Gothic [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] (1087–1314) had been the tallest cathedral in England until it was destroyed by the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. Today the tallest combined Gothic tower and spire in the UK belongs to [[Salisbury Cathedral]], (123 meters or 404 feet), built 1220–1258.

In [[Italy]], the tower, if present, is almost always detached from the building, as at [[Florence Cathedral]], and is often from an earlier structure. In [[France]] and [[Spain]], two towers on the front is the norm. In [[England]], [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]] this is often the arrangement, but an English cathedral may also be surmounted by an enormous tower at the crossing. Smaller churches usually have just one tower, but this may also be the case at larger buildings, such as [[Salisbury Cathedral]] or [[Ulm Minster]] in [[Ulm]], [[Germany]], completed in 1890 and possessing the tallest spire in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DtS2iD79NgEC|title=Cathedrals|author=Oggins, R.O.|year=2000|work=Metrobooks|publisher=Friedman/Fairfax Publishers|accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; slightly exceeding that of [[Lincoln Cathedral]], the tallest spire that was actually completed during the medieval period, at {{convert|160|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1950812_2018362,00.html|title=A Brief History of the World's Tallest Buildings|publisher=Time Magazine|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The exteriors and interiors of Gothic cathedrals, particularly in France, were lavishly ornamented with sculpture and decoration on religious themes, designed for the great majority of parishioners who could not read. They were described as "Books for the poor." To add to the effect, all of the sculpture on the facades was originally painted and gilded.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Viollet-le-Duc, Eugéne, ''Dictionnaire Raisonné de l'architecture Française du XIe au XVI siecle'', Volume 6. (Project Gutenburg).&lt;/ref&gt;

Each feature of the Cathedral had a symbolic meaning. The main portals at [[Notre Dame de Paris]], for instance, represented the entrance to paradise, with the [[last judgement]] depicted on the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the doors, showing Christ surrounded by the apostles, and by the signs of the zodiac, representing the movements of the heavens. The columns below the tympanum are in the form of statues of saints, literally reprinting them as "the pillars of the church." {{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158–59}}

Each Saint had his own symbol; a winged lion stood for [[Saint Mark]]; an eagle with four wings meant [[Saint John the Apostle]], and a winged bull symbolized [[Saint Luke]]. Sculpted angels had specific functions, sometimes as heralds, blowing trumpete, or holding up columns, as guardian angels; or holding crowns of thorns or crosses, as symbols of the crucifixion of Christ, or waving a container with incense, to illustrate theirfunction at the throne of God. Floral and vegetal decoration was also very common, representing the Garden of Eden; grapes represented the wines of [[Eucharist]].{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158–59}}

The [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the central portal on the west facade of [[Notre Dame de Paris]] vividly illustrates the [[Last Judgement]], with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven. The sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the [[Virgin Mary]], and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to Parisians, particularly [[Saint Anne]], the mother of the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Renault|Lazé|2006|p=35}}

The exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters. These included the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the [[Strix (mythology)|Strix]] or stryge, a creature resembling an [[owl]] or [[bat]], which was said to eat human flesh. The ''strix'' appeared in classical Roman literature; it was described by the Roman poet [[Ovid]], who was widely read in the Middle Ages, as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, and greyish white wings.&lt;ref name=fasti&gt;Frazer, James George (1933) ed., Ovid, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi007.perseus-lat1:6 ''Fasti''] VI. 131–, {{harvp|Riley|1851|p=216}}, tr.&lt;/ref&gt; They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshipers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=97–99}}

The [[gargoyle]]s, which were added to Notre Dame in about 1240, had a more practical purpose. They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows so that it would not erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Many of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from facade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]]. They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]], during the 19th century restoration. Similar figures appear on the other Gothic Cathedrals of France.

Another common feature of Gothic cathedrals in France was a [[labyrinth]] or maze on the floor of the nave near the choir, which symbolized the difficult and often complicated journey of a Christian life before attaining paradise. Most labyrinths were removed by the 18th century, but a few, like the one at [[Amiens Cathedral]], have been reconstructed, and the labyrinth at [[Chartres Cathedral]] still exists essentially in its original form.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=99–100}}

From the 12th century onwards, the Gothic style spread from Northern France to other regions of France and gradually to the rest of the Europe. It was often carried by the highly skilled craftsmen who had trained in the Ile-de-France and then carried their crafts to other cities. The style was adapted to local styles and materials.

In [[Normandy]], the new naves were usually very long, sometimes more than one hundred meters, and, from the long Romanesque tradition, the walls were thicker than in northern France, and had shorter buttresses. The interiors were narrower than in the north, and were given a strong sense of verticality by long and narrow bays and lancet arches. Rose windows were rare, replaced on the exterior by a large bay in ''tiers point''. The facades had less sculptural decoration; decoration in the interior was largely in geometric forms.Norman Gothic also usually featured a profusion of towers, lanterns and spires; spires and spires sometimes were seventy meters high. [[Bayeux Cathedral]], [[Rouen Cathedral]], and [[Coutances Cathedral]] are notable examples of Norman Gothic.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39–41}}

In [[Burgundy]], which had a long [[Romanesque style]] tradition, a [[lantern tower]] was often included, and cathedrals often had a narrow passage the length of the cathedral at the level of the stained glass windows. as in [[Auxerre Cathedral]].

In the Southwest of France, the walls were thicker, with narrow openings, and doubled with arches. The flying buttress were rarely used, replaced by heavy abutments with chapels between.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39–41}}

In the South of France, the Gothic cathedrals were often built with brick and tile rather than stone. They generally had thick walls and narrow windows, and were braced by heavy abutments rather than flying buttresses. The form of the tower of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] was copied by several cathedrals in the south. They generally had a single nave or two or three of equal height. Some Gothic cathedrals in the Midi took unusual form; the [[Cathedral of Albi]] (1282–1480) was originally built as fortress, then converted to a cathedral. Albi Cathedral has another very distinctive feature; a colorful interior and painted ceiling.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39–41}}

The facade of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] is unusual; it is the combination of two unfinished cathedral buildings, begun in the 13th century and finally put together. Toulouse Cathedral has no flying buttresses; it is supported by massive ''contreforts'' the height of the building, with chapels between.

The Gothic style was imported very early into England, in part due to the close connection with the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which until 1204 was still ruled by the Kings of England. The first period is generally called [[early English Gothic]], and was dominant from about 1180 to 1275. The first part of major English cathedral to feature the new style was the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], begun about 1175. It was created by a French master builder, [[William of Sens]]. He added several original touches, including colored marble pavement, double columns in the arcades, and engaged slender ''colonettes'' which reached up to the vaults, borrowed from the design of [[Laon Cathedral]].{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=34–35}} [[Westminster Abbey]] was rebuilt from 1245 to 1517. [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220–1320) is also a good example of early Gothic, with the exception of its tower and spire, which were added in 1320.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}

The second period of English Gothic is known as [[Decorated Gothic]]. It is customarily divided into two the "Geometric" style (1250–90) and the "Curvilinear" style (1290–1350), and it is similar to the French [[Rayonnant]] style, with an emphasis on curvilinear forms, particularly in the windows. This period saw detailed stone carving reach its peak, with elaborately carved windows and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], often with floral patterns, or with an accolade, a carved arch over a window decorated with pinnacles and a [[fleuron (architecture)|fleuron]], or carved floral element.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}

The rib vaults of the Decorated Gothic became extremely ornate, with a profusion of ribs which were purely ornamental. The vaults were often decorated with hanging stone pendants. The columns also became more ornamental, as at Peterborough Cathedral, with ribs spreading upward.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}

The [[Perpendicular Gothic]] (c. 1380–1520) was final phase of English Gothic, lasting into the 16th century. As the name suggests, its emphasis was on clear horizontal and vertical lines, meeting at right angles. Columns extended upwards all the way to the roof, giving the interior the appearance of a cage of glass and stone, as in the nave of [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The [[Tudor Arch]] appeared, wider and lower and often framed by moldings, which was used to create larger windows and to balance the strong vertical elements. The design of the rib vaults became even more complex, including the [[fan vault]] with pendants used in the Henry IV chapel at [[Westminster Abbey]] (1503–07).{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT/&gt;

A distinctive characteristic of English cathedrals is their extreme length, and their internal emphasis upon the horizontal, which may be emphasised visually as much or more than the vertical lines. Each English cathedral (with the exception of Salisbury) has an extraordinary degree of stylistic diversity, when compared with most French, German and Italian cathedrals. It is not unusual for every part of the building to have been built in a different century and in a different style, with no attempt at creating a stylistic unity. Unlike French cathedrals, English cathedrals sprawl across their sites, with double transepts projecting strongly and ''Lady Chapels'' tacked on at a later date, such as at Westminster Abbey. In the west front, the doors are not as significant as in France, the usual congregational entrance being through a side porch. The West window is very large and never a rose, which are reserved for the transept gables. The west front may have two towers like a French Cathedral, or none. There is nearly always a tower at the crossing and it may be very large and surmounted by a spire. The distinctive English east end is square, but it may take a completely different form. Both internally and externally, the stonework is often richly decorated with carvings, particularly the capitals.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT/&gt;

Between the 13th and 16th centuries, Gothic cathedrals were constructed in most of the major cities of northern Europe. For the most part, they followed the French model, but with variations depending upon local traditions and the materials available. The first Gothic churches in Germany were built from about 1230. They included ''[[Liebfrauenkirche, Trier|Liebfrauenkirche]]'' ( ca. 1233–1283) in [[Trier]], claimed to be the oldest Gothic church in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=UNESCO|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/367|title=UNESCO Cultural Heritage Sites; Liebfrukirche, Trier}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Freiburg Cathedral]], which was built in three stages, the first beginning in 1120, though only the foundations of the original cathedral still exist. It is noted for its 116-metre tower, the only Gothic church tower in Germany that was completed in the Middle Ages (1330).

[[Prague]], in the region [[Bohemia]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was another flourishing center for Gothic architecture. [[Charles IV of Bohemia]] was both King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Empire, and he had monumental tastes. He began construction of [[Prague]]'s [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in the Gothic style in 1344, as well as a Gothic palace, [[Karlštejn|Karlstein Castle]] in Central Bohemia, and Gothic buildings for the new [[Charles University|University of Prague]]. The nave of [[Prague Cathedral]] featured the filet vault, a decorative type of vault in which the ribs criss-crossed in a mesh pattern, similar to the vaults of [[Bristol Cathedral]] and other English churches. His other Gothic projects included the lavishly-decorated Chapel of the Holy Cross inside [[Karlštejn|Karlstein Castle]] (1357–1367), and the choir of [[Aachen Cathedral]] begun in 1355, which was built on the model of [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=221–230}} Gothic architecture in Germany and the kingdoms of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] generally followed the French formula, but the towers were much taller and, if completed, were often surmounted by enormous openwork spires. The distinctive character of the interior of German Gothic cathedrals is their breadth and openness. German and Czech cathedrals, like the French, tend not to have strongly projecting [[transept]]s. There are also many [[hall church]]es (''Hallenkirchen'') without [[clerestory]] windows.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Swaan /&gt; [[Cologne Cathedral]] is after [[Milan Cathedral]] the largest Gothic cathedral in the world. Construction began in 1248 and took, with interruptions, until 1880 to complete&amp;nbsp;– a period of over 600 years. It is 144.5 metres long, 86.5&amp;nbsp;m wide and its two towers are 157&amp;nbsp;m tall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koelner-dom.de/interessantes.html?&amp;L=1 Cologne Cathedral official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brick Gothic]] ({{Lang-de|Backsteingotik}}, {{Lang-pl|Gotyk ceglany}}) is a specific style common in [[Northern Europe]], especially in Northern Germany, Poland and in the regions around the [[Baltic Sea]] without natural rock resources. Prime examples of brick gothic include [[St. Mary's Church, Gdańsk]] (1379–1502),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bazylikamariacka.pl/historia-bazylika-mariacka-gdansk/opis-archikatedralna-bazylika-mariacka|title=Historia Bazyliki Mariackiej w Gdańsku|work=www.bazylikamariacka.pl|accessdate=2009-11-23|language=pl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031174354/http://www.bazylikamariacka.pl/historia-bazylika-mariacka-gdansk/opis-archikatedralna-bazylika-mariacka|archive-date=31 October 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków]] (1290–1365) and [[Malbork Castle]] (13th century).

[[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]] (1339–1365) has the distinctive feature of a polychrome roof. Another regional variation is the [[Brabantine Gothic]] a style found in Belgium and the Netherlands. It is characterized by using light-colored [[sandstone]] or limestone, which allowed rich detailing but was prone to erosion. Features included columns with sculpted cabbage-like foliage, arched windows whose points came right up into the vaults. and, sometimes, a wooden ceiling. Examples include [[Grote Kerk, Haarlem]], in [[Haarlem]], the Netherlands, originally built as a Catholic Cathedral, now a Protestant church, and the [[Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon]] in Brussels (15th century).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Strikingly different variations of the Gothic style appeared in southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal. Important examples of Spanish Gothic include [[Toledo Cathedral]], [[León Cathedral]], and [[Burgos Cathedral]].
The distinctive characteristic of Gothic cathedrals of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] is their spatial complexity, with many areas of different shapes leading from each other. They are comparatively wide, and often have very tall arcades surmounted by low clerestories, giving a similar spacious appearance to the ''Hallenkirche'' of Germany, as at the Church of the [[Batalha Monastery]] in Portugal. Many of the cathedrals are completely surrounded by chapels. Like English cathedrals, each is often stylistically diverse. This expresses itself both in the addition of chapels and in the application of decorative details drawn from different sources. Among the influences on both decoration and form are [[Islamic architecture]] and, towards the end of the period, Renaissance details combined with the Gothic in a distinctive manner. The West front, as at [[Leon Cathedral]], typically resembles a French west front, but wider in proportion to height and often with greater diversity of detail and a combination of intricate ornament with broad plain surfaces. At [[Burgos Cathedral]] there are spires of German style. The roofline often has pierced parapets with comparatively few pinnacles. There are often towers and domes of a great variety of shapes and structural invention rising above the roof.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;!---DO NOT CHANGE. READ DISCUSSION PAGE---&gt;

In the territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]] (Aragon, Catalonia, [[Roussillon]] in France, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Valencian Community]], among others in the Italian islands), the Gothic style suppressed the [[transept]] and made the [[Aisle#Church architecture|side-aisles]] almost as high as the main nave, creating wider spaces, and with few ornaments. There are two different Gothic styles in the Aragonese lands: [[Catalan Gothic]] and [[Valencian Gothic]], which are different from those in the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and France.

The most important samples of Catalan Gothic style are the cathedrals of [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]], [[Perpignan]] and [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]] (in [[Mallorca]]), the basilica of [[Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona|Santa Maria del Mar]] (in Barcelona), the [[Santa Maria del Pi, Barcelona|Basílica del Pi]] (in Barcelona), and the church of [[Santa Maria, Manresa|Santa Maria de l'Alba]] in [[Manresa]].

The most important examples of Valencian Gothic style in the old [[Kingdom of Valencia]] are the [[Valencia Cathedral]], [[Llotja de la Seda]] (Unesco World Heritage site), [[Torres de Serranos]], Torres de Quart, [[Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba]], in [[Alfauir]], [[Palace of the Borgias]] in [[Gandia]], [[Monastery of Santa María de la Valldigna]], [[Basilica of Santa Maria, Alicante|Basilica of Santa Maria]], in [[Alicante]], [[Orihuela Cathedral]], [[Castelló Cathedral]] and [[El Fadrí]], [[Segorbe Cathedral]], etc.

[[Italian Gothic architecture]] went its own particular way, departing from the French model. It was influenced by other styles, notably the [[Byzantine style]] introduced in [[Ravenna]]. Major examples include [[Milan Cathedral]], the [[Orvieto Cathedral]], and particularly [[Florence Cathedral]], before the addition of the Duomo in the Renaissance.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}

The Italian style was influenced by the materials available in the different regions; [[marble]] was available in great quantities in [[Tuscany]], and was lavishly used in churches; it was scarce in [[Lombardy]], and brick was used instead. But many of the architectural elements were used apparently mainly to be different from the French style.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|page=147}}

The [[Cistercian]] monastic order introduced some of the first Gothic churches into Italy, in [[Fossanova Abbey]] (consecrated 1208) and the [[Casamari Abbey]] (1203–1217). They followed the basic plan of the Gothic Cistercian churches of [[Burgundy]], particularly [[Cîteaux Abbey]].{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|page=148}}

The Italian plan is usually regular and symmetrical, Italian cathedrals have few and widely spaced columns. The proportions are generally mathematically equilibrated, based on the square and the concept of "''armonìa''", and except in Venice where they loved flamboyant arches, the arches are almost always equilateral. Italian Gothic cathedrals often retained Romanesque features; the nave of [[Orvieto Cathedral]] had Romanesque arches and vaults.

Italian Cathedrals also offered a variety of plans; [[Florence Cathedral]] (begun 1246) had a rectangular choir, based on the Cistercian model, but was designed to have three wings with polygonal chapels. Italian Gothic cathedrals were general not as tall as those in France; they rarely used flying buttresses, and generally had only two levels, an arcade and a claire-voie with small windows; but [[Bologna Cathedral]] (begun in 1388), rivaled [[Bourges Cathedral]] in France in height. The smallest notable Italian Gothic church is [[Santa Maria della Spina]] in [[Pisa]] (about 1330), which resembles a Gothic jewel box.{{sfn|Martindale|1993|page=148}}

A distinctive characteristic of Italian Gothic is the use of polychrome decoration, both externally as marble veneer on the brick façade and internally where the arches are often made of alternating black and white segments. The columns were sometimes painted red, and the walls were decorated with frescoes and the apse with mosaic. Italian cathedral façades are often polychrome and may include mosaics in the lunettes over the doors. The façades have projecting open porches and ocular or wheel windows rather than roses, and do not usually have a tower. The crossing is usually surmounted by a dome. There is often a free-standing tower and baptistery. The eastern end usually has an apse of comparatively low projection. The windows are not as large as in northern Europe and, although stained glass windows are often found, the favourite narrative medium for the interior is the [[fresco]].&lt;ref name=BF/&gt; The facade of [[Orvieto Cathedral]], begun in 1310, is a striking example of mosaic decoration. Another innovation of Italian Gothic is the bronze doorway covered with sculpture; the most famous examples are the doors of the Baptistry of Florence, by [[Andrea Pisano]] (1330–1336).{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=161–175}}

Italian Gothic cathedrals did not have the elaborate sculptural tympanums over the entrances of French cathedrals, but they had abundant realistic sculptural decoration. Some of the finest work was done by [[Nicola Pisano]] at the Baptistery of [[Pisa Cathedral]] (1259–60), and in [[Siena Cathedral]]; and by his son [[Giovanni Pisano]] on the west facade of Pisa Cathedral (1284–85).{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pages=152–176}}

While cathedrals were the most prominent structures in the Gothic style, Gothic features were also built for many monasteries across Europe. Prominent examples were built by the [[Benedictine order|Benedictines]] in England, France, and Normandy. They were the builders of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St Denis]], and [[Abbey of Saint-Remi]] in [[France]]. Later Benedictine projects (constructions and renovations) include [[Rouen]]'s [[Church of St. Ouen, Rouen|Abbey of Saint-Ouen]],the Abbey [[La Chaise-Dieu]], and the choir of [[Mont Saint-Michel]] in France.

English examples are [[Westminster Abbey]], originally built as a [[Benedictine]] order monastic church; and the reconstruction of [[Canterbury Cathedral|the Benedictine church at]] [[Canterbury]]. The [[Cistercian Order|Cistercians]] spread the style as far east and south as [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]].{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=28}} Smaller orders such as the [[Carthusian order|Carthusians]] and [[Premonstratensians]] also built some 200 churches, usually near cities.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|pp=29–30}} The [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] also carried out a transition to Gothic in the 13th and 14th centuries. The [[Teutonic Order]], a military order, spread Gothic art into [[Pomerania]], [[East Prussia]], and the Baltic region.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=30}}

The earliest example of Gothic architecture in Germany is [[Maulbronn Monastery]], a Romanesque [[Cistercian]] abbey in southwest Germany whose [[narthex]] was built in the early 12th century by an anonymous architect.{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=79}}

[[Batalha Monastery]] (1386–1517) is a Dominican monastery in [[Batalha, Portugal]]. The monastery was built in the [[Flamboyant Gothic]] style to thank the [[Virgin Mary]] for the Portuguese victory over the [[Kingdom of Castile]] in the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]] in 1385.

The Gothic style appeared in palaces in France, including the Papal Palace in Avignon and the [[Palais de la Cité]] in Paris, close to [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], begun in 1119, which was the principal residence of the French Kings until 1417. Most of the Palais de la Cité is gone, but two of the original towers along the Seine, of the towers, the vaulted ceilings of the Hall of the Men-at-Arms (1302), (now in the [[Conciergerie]]; and the original chapel, [[Sainte-Chapelle]], can still be seen.{{sfn|Texier|2012|p=12}}

The largest civic building built in the Gothic style in France was the [[Palais des Papes]] (Palace of the Popes) constructed between 1252 and 1364, when the Popes fled the political chaos and wars enveloping Rome. Given the complicated political situation, it combined the functions of a church, a seat of government and a fortress.

In the 15th century, following the late Gothic or flamboyant period, elements of Gothic decoration borrowed from cathedrals began to appear in the town halls of northern France, in Flanders and in the Netherlands. The Hôtel de Ville of [[Compiègne]] has an imposing gothic bell tower, featuring a spire surrounded by smaller towers, and its windows are decorated with ornate ''accolades'' or ornamental arches. Similarly flamboyant town halls were found in [[Arras]], [[Douai]], and [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne]], and in modern Belgium, in [[Brussels]] and [[Ghent]] and [[Bruges]].{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=64}}

Notable Gothic civil architecture in Spain includes the [[Llotja de la Seda|Silk Exchange]] in [[Valencia]], Spain (1482–1548), a major marketplace, which features a main hall with twisting columns beneath its vaulted ceiling. Another Spanish Gothic landmark is the [[Palace of the Kings of Navarre of Olite|Palace of the Kings of Navarre]] in [[Olite]] (1269–1512), which combining the features of a palace and a fortress.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The first universities in Europe were closely associated with the Catholic church, and in the late 15th century they adapted variations of the Gothic style for their architecture. The Gothic style was adapted from English monasteries for use in the first colleges of [[Oxford University]], including [[Magdalen College]]. It was also used at the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain. The use of the late Gothic style at Oxford and [[Cambridge University]] inspired the picturesque Gothic architecture in U.S. colleges in the 19th and 20th century.

By the late Middle Ages university towns had grown in wealth and importance as well, and this was reflected in the buildings of some of Europe's ancient universities. Particularly remarkable examples still standing nowadays include the [[Collegio di Spagna]] in the [[University of Bologna]], built during the 14th and 15th centuries; the [[Karolinum|Collegium Carolinum]] of the [[Charles University in Prague]] in Bohemia; the [[University of Salamanca|Escuelas mayores]] of the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain; the chapel of [[King's College, Cambridge]]; or the [[Collegium Maius]] of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]], Poland.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the 13th century, the design of the ''chateau fort'', or castle, was modified, based on the Byzantine and Moslem castles the French knights had seen during the [[Crusades]]. The new kind of fortification was called Phillipienne, after [[Philippe Auguste]], who had taken part in the Crusades. The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the center, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured. The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example. It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.

In the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other. The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''Crénaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings (''Merlons'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''Mâchicoulis''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''Échauguettes'' and ''Bretéches'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''Meurtriéres'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbalètes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=66–67}}

Castles were surrounded by deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge. The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed. The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers. One good surviving example is the [[Château de Dourdan]] in the Seine-et-Marne department, near [[Nemours]].&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé (2006), pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337–1453), with improvements in artillery, the castles lost most of their military importance. They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants; the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls. The tower of the Chateau of Vincennes became a royal residence.{{sfn|Renault|Lazé|2006|p=38}}

==Decline==
Beginning in the 16th century, as [[Renaissance architecture]] from Italy began to appear in France and other countries in Europe, the dominance of Gothic architecture began to wane. Nonetheless, new Gothic buildings, particularly churches, continued to be built; new Gothic churches built in Paris in this period included [[Saint-Merri]] (1520–1552); and [[Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois]]; The first signs of classicism in Paris churches, at [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]], did not appear until 1540. The largest new church, [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]] (1532–1560), rivaled Notre-Dame in size, 105 meters long, 44 meters wide, and 35 meters high. As construction of this church continued, elements of Renaissance decoration, including the system of classical orders of columns, were added to the design, making it an early Gothic-Renaissance hybrid.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=24–26}}

The Gothic style began to be described as outdated, ugly and even barbaric. The term "Gothic" was first used as a [[pejorative]] description. [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term "barbarous German style" in his 1550 ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' to describe what is now considered the Gothic style.{{sfn|Vasari|1991|pp=117, 527}} In the introduction to the ''Lives'' he attributed various architectural features to "[[Goths|the Goths]]" whom he held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered [[Rome]], and erecting new ones in this style.{{sfn|Vasari|Brown|Maclehose|1907|p=83}} In the 17th century, [[Molière]] also mocked the Gothic style in the 1669 poem ''La Gloire'': "...the insipid taste of Gothic ornamentation, these odious monstrosities of an ignorant age, produced by the torrents of barbarism..."{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=9}} The dominant styles in Europe became in turn [[Italian Renaissance architecture]], [[Baroque architecture]], and the grand classicism of the [[Louis XIV style]].

Nonetheless, Gothic architecture, usually churches or university buildings, continued to be built. Ireland was an island of Gothic architecture in the 17th and 18th centuries, with the construction of [[St Columb's Cathedral|Derry Cathedral]] (completed 1633), [[St John the Baptist Cathedral, Sligo|Sligo Cathedral]] (c. 1730), and [[Down Cathedral]] (1790–1818) are other notable examples.&lt;ref&gt;-Bob Hunter [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/plantation/transcripts/pa01_t06.shtml "Londonderry Cathedtral"]. BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th and 18th century several important Gothic buildings were constructed at [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]], including [[Tom Tower]] at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], by [[Christopher Wren]] (1681–82) It also appeared, in a whimsical fashion, in [[Horace Walpole]]'s [[Twickenham]] [[villa]], [[Strawberry Hill House|Strawberry Hill]] (1749–1776) The two western towers of [[Westminster Abbey]] were constructed between 1722 and 1745 by [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], opening a new period of [[Gothic Revival]].

In England, partly in response to a philosophy propounded by the [[Oxford Movement]] and others associated with the emerging revival of 'high church' or [[Anglo-Catholic]] ideas during the second quarter of the 19th century, neo-Gothic began to become promoted by influential establishment figures as the preferred style for ecclesiastical, civic and institutional architecture. The appeal of this [[Gothic revival]] (which after 1837, in Britain, is sometimes termed [[Victorian Gothic]]), gradually widened to encompass "low church" as well as "high church" clients. This period of more universal appeal, spanning 1855–1885, is known in Britain as [[High Victorian Gothic]].

The [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London by Sir [[Charles Barry]] with interiors by a major exponent of the early Gothic Revival, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]], is an example of the Gothic revival style from its earlier period in the second quarter of the 19th century. Examples from the ''High Victorian Gothic'' period include [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s design for the [[Albert Memorial]] in London, and [[William Butterfield]]'s chapel at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. From the second half of the 19th century onwards, it became more common in Britain for neo-Gothic to be used in the design of non-ecclesiastical and non-governmental buildings types. Gothic details even began to appear in working-class housing schemes subsidised by philanthropy, though given the expense, less frequently than in the design of upper and middle-class housing.

The middle of the 19th century was a period marked by the restoration, and in some cases modification, of ancient monuments and the construction of neo-Gothic edifices such as the nave of [[Cologne Cathedral]] and the [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clotilde]] of [[Paris]] as speculation of medieval architecture turned to technical consideration. London's Palace of Westminster, St. Pancras railway station, New York's Trinity Church and St. Patrick's Cathedral are also famous examples of Gothic Revival buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/gothic-architecture|title=Gothic Architecture and Churches {{!}} Architectural Digest|website=Architectural Digest|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such style also reached the [[Far East]] in the period, for instance, the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[St. John's Cathedral (Hong Kong)|St. John's Cathedral]] which was located at the centre of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria City]] in [[Central, Hong Kong]].

While some credit for this new ideation can reasonably be assigned to German and English writers, namely [[Johannes Vetter]], Franz Mertens, and Robert Willis respectively, this emerging style's champion was [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], whose lead was taken by archaeologists, historians, and architects like [[Jules Quicherat]], [[Auguste Choisy]], and [[Marcel Aubert]].{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=11}} In the last years of the 19th century, a trend among study in art history emerged in Germany that a building, as defined by [[Henri Focillon]] was an interpretation of space.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=13}} When applied to Gothic cathedrals, historians and architects used to the dimensions of 17th and 18th [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] or [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] structures, were astounded by the height and extreme length of the cathedrals compared to its proportionally modest width. [[Goethe]], in the preceding century, was mesmerised by the space within a Gothic church and succeeding historians like [[Georg Dehio]], Walter Ueberwasser, [[Paul Frankl]], and Maria Velte sought to rediscover the methodology used in their construction by making measurements and drawings of the buildings, and reading and making conjectures from documents and treaties pertaining to their construction.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=14}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
France had an abundance of original Gothic architecture, and therefore Gothic restoration largely replaced revival; few new buildings appeared in the Gothic style.

The [[French Revolution]] caused enormous damage to the Gothic architecture of France. [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and other cathedrals and churches were closed and stripped of much of their decoration. In the 1830s, under the new King, [[Louis-Philippe]], the historic and artistic value of Cathedrals and other Gothic monuments was recognized. Interest in the Gothic style was also stimulated by the huge success of the novel ''Notre Dame de Paris'' (known in English as ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'') by [[Victor Hugo]], published in 1831. The writings of the romantic author [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] also played an important part; he praised the religious sentiments inspired by of the Gothic style, and declaring that the Gothic style was "the true architecture of our country," as important in the history of France as the forests of ancient Gaul.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=99}} A Commission of Historic Monuments was created in 1837, and major program of cataloging, protection and restoration of Gothic monuments was organized by the writer [[Prosper Merimée]] and conducted largely by the architect [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]].{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=99}}

[[Viollet-le-Duc]] conducted the restoration of [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and many other churches, as well as the Gothic fortifications of [[Carcasonne]] and imaginatively finishing the castle of [[Château de Pierrefonds]], which had been only a ruin.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014}} He did not always limit himself to strict restoration of what had existed; in 1838 he designed he built a new Gothic west facade for the Parish church of Saint-Ouen in [[Rouen]]. The architects [[Franz Christian Gau]] and then [[Théodore Ballu]] built [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|The Basilica of Sainte-Clotilde]] (1846–57), the first entirely neo-Gothic church in Paris.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=101}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
German Gothic revival was born in 1785–86 in the [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]], an early landscape garden built by near [[Potsdam]], in the garden of the country house of [[Leopold III, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau]], designed by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Erdmannsdorff]]. The ''Gothic House'' displayed his collection of medieval stained glass. It inspired other Gothic-style country houses near Berlin and Kassel. {{sfn|Toman|2007|page=156}}

In Germany, the early 19th century Gothic revival had close ties to the movement of [[Romanticism]]. Beginning in 1814, the writer and historian [[Joseph Gorres]] launched a movement for the completion [[Cologne cathedral]], which had been halted in 1473. The work was begun in 1842, and the two towers were completed in 1880, six hundred years after the cathedral was begun. Similar projects were undertaken for [[Ulm Minster]], [[Heilsbronn Abbey]] and the [[Isartor]] gate in Munich. The Baroque decoration of these monuments was removed, and they were returned to at least an approximation, sometimes romanticized, of their original Gothic appearance. {{sfn|Toman|2007|page=156}}

The most picturesque example of Gothic revival is [[Neuschwanstein Castle]] (1869–1876) in Bavaria built by [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]]. For inspiration, Ludwig visited other Gothic reconstruction projects, [[Warburg]] and [[Château de Pierrefonds]], a castle which had been reconstructed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]]. The highly romantic Neuschwanstein Castle inspired, among other later buildings, the Sleeping Beauty Castle in [[Disneyland]] (1955).

Though Russia had no tradition of Gothic architecture, The Empress [[Catherine the Great]] chose the style in [[Tsaritsyno Palace]], a large palace complex she constructed south of Moscow from 1776 until her death in 1796. Later, Czar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] commissioned the German romantic writer and painter [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] to design a Gothic chapel for his park at [[Peterhof Palace]] near St. Petersburg. It was completed in 1834.

===Italy===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Gothic revival in Italy focused on the completion of earlier Cathedrals, which had been largely left to crumble. The most striking example was [[Milan Cathedral]], which received a new facade in 1806–1813 which almost completely covered the original; it was designed by Giuseppe Zanoia and [[Carlo Amati]]. In 1888 it received a Gothic crown on the front facade by [[Giuseppe Brentano]]. The famous spires and pinnacles of the building date to the 19th century.{{sfn|Toman|2007|page=123}}

A small but notable example of Gothic revival in Italy is the [[Pedrocchi Café]] in Padua, Italy (1837), by [[Giuseppe Jappelli]]. It borrowed the [[Venetian Gothic]] style plus the pinnacles of Milan Cathedral. It became famous as the meeting place of Italian patriots rebelling against Austrian rule in 1848.

The English Gothic revival style was imported from England beginning in the 1830s, and was used primarily for Anglican and Catholic churches, and for university buildings. The best-known Gothic revival buildings in Canada are those [[Centre Bloc]] and the [[Victoria Tower (Canada)|Victoria Tower]] of the [[Parliament of Canada]] on [[Parliament Hill]] in Ottawa, by [[Thomas Fuller (architect)|Thomas Fuller]] (1859–1927).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/appendix_a |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624082557/http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/appendix_a |archivedate=2015-06-24 |df= }} List of Dominion Architects of Canada&lt;/ref&gt; The architect [[William Thomas (architect)|William Thomas]] constructed [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Toronto|St. Michael's Cathedral]] in Toronto (1845–48), and several other Gothic revival churches in the Province of [[Ontario]].

The Gothic style was entirely contrary to the early [[Puritan]] architecture in the United States, which valued simplicity and a lack of ornament. It was also contrary to the Neoclassical style used for early U.S. government buildings. However, in the mid to late 19th century, large cathedrals and churches began to be built in the Gothic Revival style, modeled after European cathedrals. University buildings also adopted the style, using English colleges as a model. In the early 20th century, Gothic decorative elements appeared on the towers of the new skyscrapers, notably the [[Woolworth Building]] by [[Cass Gilbert]] in New York and the [[Chicago Tribune Building]] in [[Chicago]], by [[John Mead Howells]] and [[Raymond Hood]], symbolizing the role of these buildings as "cathedrals of commerce."&lt;ref&gt;Christen, Barbara S. and Flanders, Steven (editors).

''Raymond Hood, Architect – Form Through Function in the American Skyscraper''. Architectural Book Publishing Co Inc, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gothic architecture also inspired a popular style of residential architecture in the United States in the mid-19th century. It was known as [[Carpenter Gothic]], and featured pointed [[lancet windows]], a steep gable roof, and other simple Gothic elements, embellished with wooden ornament cut with a [[Jigsaw (tool)|jigsaw]] or a [[scroll saw]] in Gothic designs. Sometimes the wooden trim was attached to a brick house. It became a popular style for wooden churches in rural communities. An example of Carpenter Gothic house, the [[American Gothic House]], in [[Eldon, Iowa]] appears in the background of the celebrated painting ''[[American Gothic]]'' by [[Grant Wood]], and gave the painting its name.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;Fineman, Mia (June 8, 2005).

In the 19th century the Gothic style of church architecture was transported to Latin America by the Spanish and Portuguese, where it became a symbol of Christian values and traditions. It was also exported to Asia, largely for the churches of the European settlements there. The English Gothic style was a major influence in Australia, both for churches and civic buildings. [[Perth Town Hall]] (1867–70) was the only town hall in Australia (or perhaps anywhere) constructed by convicts.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, Delys (1969) ''100 years : a history of the Perth Town Hall'' originally printed in the [[Royal Western Australian Historical Society]]'s Journal. – reprinted by the Perth city council in 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Basilica of the Twenty-Six Holy Martyrs of Japan (Nagasaki)|Basilica of the Twenty=Six Holy Martyrs]] (1879) was an enlargement of the first Christian church in Japan, which had been built in 1864. It survived the dropping of an atomic bomb on [[Nagasaki]] in August 1945. The plan was taken from a Belgian model, and the stained glass was imported from France.

The [[Templo Expiatorio del Santísimo Sacramento|Church of the Holy Sacrament]] in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico was begun in 1897, but construction was halted by the [[Mexican Revolution]], and it was not completed until 1972.

[[St. Ignatius Cathedral|Shanghai Cathedral]] in [[China]] (1906–1910) was originally built by the [[Jesuits]] as their primary church in the trading port of Shanghai. In 1966, at the opening of the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] from Beijing vandalized the [[cathedral]], tearing down its [[spire]]s and ceiling, and smashing its roughly 300 square meters of stained glass. For the next ten years the Cathedral served as a state-owned grain warehouse. It was reopened in 1978 and the spires were restored in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/features/religion/la-tm-china29jul16,1,1569645.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true_no=1 Jesus in China]&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the city of [[Mumbai]] (formerly Bombay) has a rich collection of neo-Gothic architecture. The style is found in the University buildings, the courthouse, and in the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station]] (former Victoria Terminus), the main railway station.

==Influences==
===Political===
The roots of the Gothic style lie in those towns that, since the 11th century, had been enjoying increased prosperity and growth, began to experience more and more freedom from traditional [[Feudalism|feudal]] authority.{{sfn|Mitchell|1968|p=9}} At the end of the 12th century, Europe was divided into a multitude of [[city state]]s and kingdoms. The area encompassing modern [[Germany]], southern [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Austria]], [[Slovakia]], [[Czech Republic]] and much of northern [[Italy]] (excluding [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Papal State]]) was nominally part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], but local rulers exercised considerable autonomy under the system of [[Feudalism]]. [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Denmark]], [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]] were independent kingdoms, as was the [[Angevin Empire]], whose [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet kings]] ruled [[Kingdom of England|England]] and large domains in what was to become modern [[France]].{{efn|Section from "''L'art Gothique''," translated into English: "England was one of the first regions to adopt, during the first half of the 12th century, the new Gothic architecture born in France. Historic relationships between the two countries played a determining role: in 1154, Henry II (1154–1189) became the first of the Anjou Plantagenet kings to ascend to the throne of England."}} [[Norway]] came under the influence of [[England]], while the other Scandinavian countries and [[Poland]] were influenced by trading contacts with the [[Hanseatic League]]. [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] kings brought the Gothic tradition from France to [[Southern Italy]], while [[Lusignan]] kings introduced [[French Gothic]] architecture to [[Cyprus]]. Gothic art is sometimes viewed as the art of the era of feudalism but also as being connected to change in medieval social structure, as the Gothic style of architecture seemed to parallel the beginning of the decline of feudalism.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|pp=20, 24}} Nevertheless, the influence of the established feudal elite can be seen in the [[Chateaux]] of French lords and in those churches sponsored by feudal lords.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=24}}

Throughout Europe at this time there was a rapid growth in trade and an associated growth in towns,&lt;ref name=BF&gt;Banister Fletcher, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JH1&gt;John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''&lt;/ref&gt; and they would come to be predominate in Europe by the end of the 13th century.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=24}} Germany and the [[Low Countries]] had large flourishing towns that grew in comparative peace, in trade and competition with each other or united for mutual weal, as in the Hanseatic League. Civic building was of great importance to these towns as a sign of wealth and pride. England and France remained largely feudal and produced grand domestic architecture for their kings, dukes and [[bishops]], rather than grand [[town hall]]s for their [[Medieval bourgeoisie|burghers]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Viollet-le-Duc contended that the blossoming of the Gothic style came about as a result of growing freedoms in construction professions.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=24}}

The primary use of the Gothic style is in religious structures, naturally leading it to an association with the Church and it is considered to be one of the most formal and coordinated forms of the physical church, thought of as being the physical residence of God on Earth. According to [[Hans Sedlmayr]], it was "even the considered the temporal image of [[Paradise]], of the [[New Jerusalem]]." The horizontal and vertical scope of the Gothic church, filled with the light thought of as a symbol of the grace of God admitted into the structure via the style's iconic windows are among the very best examples of Christian architecture. [[Louis Grodecki|Grodecki]]'s ''[[#{{sfnref|Grodecki|1977}}|Gothic Architecture]]'' also notes that the glass pieces of various colors that make up those windows have been compared to "precious stones encrusting the walls of the New Jerusalem," and that "the numerous towers and pinnacles evoke similar structures that appear in the visions of [[John the Apostle|Saint John]]." Another idea, held by [[Georg Dehio]] and [[Erwin Panofsky]], is that the designs of Gothic followed the current theological scholastic thought.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}} The [[PBS]] show [[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]] explored the influence of the [[Bible]] in the dimensions and design of some cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Building the Great Cathedrals|series=[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]|last1=Tiffany|first1=Scott|last2=Tinworth|first2=Rob|last3=Barako|first3=Tristian|network=[[PBS]]|date=19 October 2010|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/building-gothic-cathedrals.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographic===
[[File:Durham Cathedral. Interior.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The transition from [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] to Gothic styles is visible at the [[Durham Cathedral]] in [[England]], where both pointed and round arches are used in the cathedral's design.]]
 
From the 10th to the 13th century, [[Romanesque architecture]] had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as [[Ireland]] and [[Croatia]], and [[Sweden]] and [[Sicily]]. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders did not define divisions of style. On the other hand, some regions such as [[England]] and [[Spain]] produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Many different factors like geographical/geological, economic, social, or political situations caused the regional differences in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period that would often become even more apparent in the Gothic. For example, studies of the population statistics reveals disparities such as the multitude of churches, abbeys, and cathedrals in northern [[France]] while in more urbanised regions construction activity of a similar scale was reserved to a few important cities. Such an example comes from Roberto López, wherein the French city of [[Amiens]] was able to fund its architectural projects whereas [[Cologne]] could not because of the economic inequality of the two.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25-26}} This wealth, concentrated in rich monasteries and noble families, would eventually spread certain Italian, Catalan, and Hanseatic bankers.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25}} This would be amended when the economic hardships of the 13th century were no longer felt, allowing [[Normandy]], [[Tuscany]], [[Flanders]], and the southern [[Rhineland]] to enter into competition with France.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=26}}

The local availability of materials affected both construction and style. In [[France]], [[limestone]] was readily available in several grades, the very fine white limestone of [[Caen]] being favoured for sculptural decoration. England had coarse limestone and red [[sandstone]] as well as dark green [[Purbeck marble]] which was often used for architectural features. In [[northern Germany]], [[Netherlands]], northern [[Poland]], [[Denmark]], and the Baltic countries local building stone was unavailable but there was a strong tradition of building in brick. The resultant style, [[Brick Gothic]] – called {{lang|pl|Gotyk ceglany}} in [[Poland]] and {{lang|de|Backsteingotik}} in [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]] – is also associated with the [[Hanseatic League]]. In [[Italy]], stone was used for [[fortifications]], so brick was preferred for other buildings. Because of the extensive and varied deposits of marble, many buildings were faced in marble, or were left with undecorated façade so that this might be achieved at a later date. The availability of timber also influenced the style of architecture, with timber buildings prevailing in [[Scandinavia]]. Availability of timber affected methods of roof construction across Europe. It is thought that the magnificent [[hammerbeam]] roofs of England were devised as a direct response to the lack of long straight seasoned timber by the end of the Medieval period, when forests had been decimated not only for the construction of vast roofs but also for ship building.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT&gt;Alec Clifton-Taylor, ''The Cathedrals of England''&lt;/ref&gt;

The pointed arch, one of the defining attributes of Gothic, was earlier incorporated into [[Islamic architecture]] following the [[Islamic conquest of Syria|Islamic conquests of]] [[Roman Syria]] and the [[Sassanid Empire]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref name=BF/&gt; The pointed arch and its precursors had been employed in [[Roman Architecture|Late Roman]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]] architecture; within the Roman context, evidenced in early church building in [[Syria]] and occasional secular structures, like the Roman [[Karamagara Bridge]]; in [[Sassanid]] architecture, in the parabolic and pointed arches employed in palace and sacred construction.&lt;ref name=Warren1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warren|first=John|year=1991|title=Creswell's Use of the Theory of Dating by the Acuteness of the Pointed Arches in Early Muslim Architecture|periodical=Muqarnas|volume=8|pages=59–65 (61–63)|doi=10.2307/1523154|jstor=1523154|publisher=BRILL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, Andrew (2002-03-11). Dictionary of Islamic Architecture, pp. 295-296. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-203-20387-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the pointed arch seems to have taken off dramatically after its incorporation into Islamic architecture. It begins to appear throughout the Islamic world in close succession after its adoption in the late Umayyad or early Abbasid period. Some examples are the [[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress|Al-Ukhaidir Palace]] (775 AD), the Abbasid reconstruction of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque|Al-Aqsa mosque]] in 780 AD, the [[White Mosque, Ramla|Ramlah Cisterns]] (789 AD), the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] (851 AD), and the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] (879 AD) in Cairo. It also appears in one of the early reconstructions of the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in Tunisia, and the Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba in 987 AD. [[David Talbot Rice]] points out that, "The pointed arch had already been used in Syria, but in the mosque of Ibn Tulun we have one of the earliest examples of its use on an extensive scale, some centuries before it was exploited in the West by the Gothic architects."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic Art|last=Rice|first=David T.|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=1979|isbn=9780500201503|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing military and cultural contacts with the [[Muslim world]], including the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman conquest]] of [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Islamic Sicily]] in 1090, the [[Crusades]] (beginning 1096), and the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic presence in Spain]], may have influenced [[Medieval Europe]]'s adoption of the pointed arch, although this hypothesis remains controversial.{{sfn|Scott|2003|p=113}}{{sfn|Bony|1983|p=17}} Certainly, in those parts of the [[Western Mediterranean]] subject to Islamic control or influence, rich regional variants arose, fusing [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and later Gothic traditions with [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] decorative forms, for example in [[Monreale Cathedral|Monreale]] and [[Cefalù Cathedral]]s, the [[Alcázar of Seville]], and [[Teruel Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, L.

A number of scholars have cited the [[Armenia]]n [[Cathedral of Ani]], completed 1001 or 1010, as a possible influence on the Gothic, especially due to its use of pointed arches and cluster [[pier (architecture)|piers]].{{sfn|Lang|1980|p=223|ps=: "With this experience behind him, it is not surprising that [[Trdat the Architect|Trdat]]'s creation of the Cathedral at [[Ani]] turned out to be a masterpiece. Even without its dome, the cathedral amazes the onlooker. Technically, it is far ahead of the contemporary [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Norman architecture]] of Europe. Already, pointed arches and clustered piers, whose appearance together is considered one of the hallmarks of mature Gothic architecture, are found in this remote corner of the Christian East."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kite|first=Stephen|title='South Opposed to East and North': Adrian Stokes and Josef Strzygowski.

[...] The most interesting features of this building are its pointed arches and vaults and the clustering or coupling of the columns in the Gothic manner."}}{{sfn|Rice|1972|p=179|ps=: "The interior of [[Ani Cathedral|Ani cathedral]], a longitudinal stone building with pointed vaults and a central dome, built about 1001, is astonishingly Gothic in every detail, and numerous other equally close parallels could be cited."}} However, other scholars such as [[Sirarpie Der Nersessian]], who rejected this notion as she argued that the pointed arches did not serve the same function of supporting the vault.{{sfn|Garsoïan|2015|p=300}} [[Lucy Der Manuelian]] contends that some [[Armenians]] (historically documented as being in Western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]]){{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=37}} could have brought the knowledge and technique employed at Ani to the west.{{sfn|Der Manuelian|2001|p=7}}

The view held by the majority of scholars however is that the pointed arch evolved naturally in Western Europe as a structural solution to a technical problem, with evidence for this being its use as a stylistic feature in Romanesque French and English churches.{{sfn|Scott|2003|p=113}}

'''''Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam''''' (1996) is a feature-length [[documentary film]] by [[Nick Broomfield]]. It concerns [[Heidi Fleiss]], then a [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] involved in a prostitution ring. In the film, Broomfield attempts to discover if Fleiss truly is a "horrible person"{{cq|date=October 2018}} and what made her that way.&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Heidi Fleiss, Hollywood Madam Movie Review|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/heidi-fleiss-hollywood-madam-1996|website=Roger Ebert|accessdate=29 January 2018|language=en|date=3 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam Movie Review|url=http://www.sky.com/tv/movie/heidi-fleiss-hollywood-madam-1995|website=Sky Cinema|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washington"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howe|first1=Desson|title=Heidi Fleiss Hollywood Madam|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/heidifleisshollywoodmadamnrhowe_c04be5.htm|website=Washington Post|accessdate=29 January 2018|date=12 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film documents the power struggle among Fleiss, another Madam known as Alex, and Fleiss' former lover [[Ivan Nagy (director)|Ivan Nagy]], himself allegedly involved in prostitution. The film also chronicles the destructive relationship between Fleiss and Nagy, a sort of mutual aggressiveness that both seem to find appealing.&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washington" /&gt; The documentary was co-funded by the [[BBC]], [[HBO]], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]].&lt;ref name="broomfield" /&gt;

==Box office==
Although it received positive reviews, ([[Roger Ebert]] called it one of the ten best films of the year),&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt; the film did not gain a large box-office return in its theatrical release.  Opening at two North American theatres on February 9, 1996, it grossed $14,321 ($7,160 per screen)&lt;ref name="mojo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madame (1996)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=heidifleiss.htm|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=29 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its opening weekend, on its way to a final gross of just $34,402.&lt;ref name="mojo" /&gt;

The '''Hudson Theatre''' is a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] theater located at 139–141 West 44th Street,&lt;ref name=landmark/&gt;{{rp|1}} between [[Times Square]] and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|6th Avenue]], [[New York City]]. Opened in 1903, it became a leading theatrical venue before also serving in later years as a network radio and television studio, a night club, a movie theater, and a corporate event space.

The Hudson Theatre reopened as a Broadway theater on February 11, 2017. The  UK-based [[Ambassador Theatre Group]] (ATG)  signed a long term lease on the theater in 2015 and invested in a complete refurbishment of the venue, bringing it back into full-time use as a Broadway playhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=ATG secures second Broadway theatre with reopening of historic Hudson| url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2015/atg-secures-second-broadway-theatre-with-reopening-of-historic-hudson/| last=Snow| first=Georgia| date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theater is owned by [[Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels]].

In 2016, the Hudson Theatre was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="NRHP listing"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places listings for December 9, 2016|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20161209.htm|publisher=[[U.S. National Park Service]]|date=December 9, 2016|accessdate=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The architectural firm of [[William H. McElfatrick|J. B. McElfatrick &amp; Son]] made initial drawings for the Hudson Theatre in 1902, but the firm of Israels &amp; Harder took the project over by 1903.&lt;ref name=landmark/&gt;{{rp|9}}
When the Hudson opened, on October 19 of that year with [[Ethel Barrymore]] starring in ''Cousin Kate'', it had a number of distinctive architectural features, including an unusually large foyer, a triple-domed ceiling, and a system of diffused lighting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/10/18/102026632.pdf "The New Hudson Theatre".] ''[[The New York Times]].'' October 18, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/10/20/104914409.pdf "Miss Ethel Barrymore in ''Cousin Kate''".] ''The New York Times.'' October 20, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924015151412;view=1up;seq=210 "The Hudson Theatre".] ''Architects' and Builders' Magazine.'' Vol. 36 No. 5 (February 1904). p. 200. Online at HathiTrust.&lt;/ref&gt; Built by theatrical producer [[Henry B. Harris]], the theatre was later managed by his wife [[Renee Harris (producer)|Renee Harris]] following his death on the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].

From the 1930s through the 1940s the theater often served as a [[CBS Radio]] studio in between theatrical engagements. In 1950, [[NBC]] purchased the theater and converted it for permanent use as a television studio. ''[[Broadway Open House]]'' and ''[[Kate_Smith#Television|The Kate Smith Hour]]'' were among the shows that originated there. In 1954, the Hudson became home to ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen|The Tonight Show]]'' which remained there, first with host [[Steve Allen]] and later [[Jack Paar]], until 1959.

Developer [[Abraham Hirschfeld]] purchased the structure in 1956, and returned it to use as a legitimate theater from 1960 to 1968. It became a movie house for adult films in 1974. Then in 1980 it became the Savoy rock club.&lt;ref name=landmark&gt;{{cite book| publication-date=November 17, 1987| publisher=New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission| url=http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/1987HudsonTheater.pdf| title=Hudson Theater Designation Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14–5}} In 1987, the building was granted landmark status by the City of New York.&lt;ref name=landmark/&gt;{{rp|1,18}}

When owner Henry Macklowe developed the surrounding lots into a new luxury hotel, the Macklowe Hotel, he incorporated the landmarked theater, using it as a conference center and auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/04/nyregion/hotel-is-macklowe-s-bid-for-a-shinier-image.html | work=The New York Times | accessdate = March 9, 2017 | date = August 4, 1990 | first = Sam | last = Roberts | title = Hotel Is Macklowe's Bid for a Shinier Image }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels]] bought the hotel and the Hudson in 1995, renaming the hotel the [[Millennium Broadway]]. During its time as a conference center for the hotel. the Hudson Theatre was also the site of stand-up comedy shows which were taped for broadcast on the [[Comedy Central]] cable network.

In 2015 it was announced that the British-based [[Ambassador Theatre Group]] would assume management of the Hudson from the hotel and convert it back into a legitimate Broadway theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2015/03/10/broadways-newest-landlord-is-a-colorful-mormon-loving-brit/| work=New York Post| first=Michael| last=Riedel| title=Broadway's newest landlord is a colorful, 'Mormon'-loving Brit| date=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reopening in 2017, the Hudson became the 41st theater operating on Broadway and also the oldest, having originally opened slightly earlier in 1903 than the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum]] and [[New Amsterdam Theatre|New Amsterdam]] Theatres.&lt;ref&gt;Viagas, Robert.

The Hudson reopened as a Broadway theater in 2017 with a revival of the [[Stephen Sondheim]] musical ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]''. The limited 10-week run featured [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] and opened February 11 for previews with an official opening on February 23, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, Michael.

The '''James Sewell Ballet''' is a [[Minneapolis, MN|Minneapolis, Minnesota]]-based ballet company of eight dancers founded in 1990 by James Sewell and Sally Rousse.

==History==
James Sewell Ballet (JSB) was founded in 1990 by James Sewell and Sally Rousse in New York City. In 1992, Sewell and Rousse moved the company to Minneapolis, Minnesota, Sewell’s hometown, where it has since resided for nearly two decades.

==Company==
'''James Sewell'''
Sewell is the Artistic Director and co-founder of James Sewell Ballet.  After moving to New York, Sewell trained at the School of American Ballet, where he performed with ABT II.  Sewell was a lead dancer with [[Feld Ballets/NY]] for six years, and has performed as a guest artist with New York City Ballet and Denishawn.  While in New York, Sewell joined forces with co-founder Sally Rousse to create James Sewell Ballet.  Sewell has since choreographed over 70 ballets for James Sewell Ballet and other companies world-wide.

'''Sally Rousse'''
Rousse began dancing in Barre, Vermont. She trained at the School of American Ballet and with David Howard before performing as a leading dancer with Ballet Chicago, the Royal Ballet of Flanders, and James Sewell Ballet. In 2001, Rousse was awarded a McKnight Artist Fellowship for Dancers.  She was also named a [[City Pages]] "Artist of the Year" in 2009 for her work in the Minneapolis dance community.  In addition to her work with James Sewell Ballet, Rousse also works as an independent choreographer in the Minneapolis area.

==Community Outreach==
Over the past few years, JSB has undertaken a series of outreach initiatives to integrate audiences into its programmatic events.

===SmArts Program===
	The SmArts – School Performance Curriculum program, developed with educational consultant Mitchell Korn, is James Sewell Ballet’s community dance education program for elementary and middle school students.  Serving 7,000-8,000 students annually, the SmArts program concentrates on the four life lessons of Communication, Coordination, Cooperation, and Discipline through an interactive dance demonstration and lecture program.

===First Chance Dance===
	JSB’s First Chance Dance Program offers reduced-price mainstage performances to families with young children.  These programs consist of an informal, 60-minute Saturday morning showing that provides young audiences an introduction to the dance community.

In addition to these programs, James Sewell Ballet also emphasizes mentorship activities with local dance students as part of its residency activities.

==Repertory==
The majority of works performed by James Sewell Ballet are the choreography of artistic director James Sewell.  Since 1990, James Sewell Ballet has performed over 70 of Sewell’s works.  Sewell and the JSB dancers work mostly in the contemporary ballet idiom, which incorporates the disciplines of classical ballet, modern, and jazz dance.  In accordance with its tagline “Sometimes controversial, sometimes funny, always innovative,” Sewell’s work is known for its frequent inclusion of satire and social commentary.

===Ballet Works Project===
In addition to Sewell’s choreography, the company also performs the work of other selected choreographers as part of its annual Ballet Works Project concert.  For the past sixteen years, the Ballet Works Project has been a collaboration between emerging and established choreographers and James Sewell Ballet.  The goal of this project is to provide artists a liberal space for exploration and discovery in dance, with the JSB dancers as their canvas.  Each year, the dancers choose the choreographers for the Ballet Works Project.  Past participants have included JSB company members (other than Sewell), as well as a myriad of local and national talents.  Since 2009, JSB’s Winter season concerts have been devoted to performances of the Ballet Works Project.

'''''Joseph and Potiphar's Wife''''' is a 1634 etching by [[Rembrandt]] ([[Adam Bartsch|Bartsch]] 39). It depicts a story from the [[Bible]], wherein [[Zuleika (tradition)|Potiphar's Wife]] attempts to seduce [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]].  It is signed and dated "Rembrandt f. 1634" (f. for ''fecit'' or "made this"), and exists in two [[state (printmaking)|states]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
According to the [[Book of Genesis]] 39:1–20, Joseph was bought as a slave by the Egyptian [[Potiphar]], an officer of the [[Pharaoh]].  [[Potiphar's Wife]] tried to seduce Joseph, who eluded her advances. As Joseph repelled her attempt to lure him into her bed, she grabbed him by his coat: "And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within. And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out" (Genesis 39: 11–12).&lt;ref name="B"&gt;British Museum&lt;/ref&gt; Citing his garment as evidence, Potiphar's wife falsely accused Joseph of having assaulted her, and he was sent to prison.

Rembrandt's etching is a dramatic presentation of the moment Potiphar's wife grabs the fleeing Joseph. Considered "unprecedented in its erotic candor",&lt;ref name="P"&gt;Perlove, Silver, 99&lt;/ref&gt; it shows Joseph averting his eyes from the frankly depicted nude lower body of his master's wife. Only an etching of 1600 by [[Antonio Tempesta]] had portrayed a comparable sexual aggressiveness.&lt;ref name="P"&gt;Perlove, Silver, 99&lt;/ref&gt; Despite compositional similarities to the Tempesta, Rembrandt's depiction of human emotions—Joseph's revulsion and the desperation of Potiphar's wife—is unique to him, and the work is more blunt in its suggestion of the woman's physical appetite.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="P"&gt;Perlove, Silver, 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="F"&gt;Fitzwilliam, 6&lt;/ref&gt; As in his 1638 etching of ''Adam and Eve'', the explicit depiction of the female's vulva is unusual, and emphasizes the seductress's lasciviousness; a persistent notion from antiquity to 17th century Holland was that a woman's genitals hungered insatiably for the male's seed.&lt;ref name="S1"&gt;Sluijter, 287&lt;/ref&gt; Of some 300 etchings that Rembrandt produced, ''Joseph and Potiphar's Wife'' was one of only four or five that may be classified as erotica; these prints were not widely disseminated during his life.&lt;ref name="R"&gt;Rohleder&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rembrandt - Joseph and Potiphar's wife, 1634 - copperplate (B39).JPG|left|thumb|The original copper plate of ''Joseph and Potiphar's Wife'', on loan to the [[Rembrandthuis]].]]
A context for Rembrandt's unidealized interpretation of the nude was proposed by [[Kenneth Clark]], who noted that the artist's female figures from the early 1630s marked a break with the abundant exuberance of his contemporary, [[Peter Paul Rubens]], and were at stark contrast with the classicism of the conventional nude.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;Clark, 338–340&lt;/ref&gt; Rembrandt's etchings offered a "defiant truthfulness", as well as a sense of pity for physical imperfections, the fat and wrinkles of the human body.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;Clark, 338–340&lt;/ref&gt;

Rembrandt may have intended moral implications in the dramatic use of light and shadow, with Joseph seen radiantly illuminated on the left side of the print and Potiphar's wife surrounded by the darkness of her bedchamber on the right.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="F"&gt;Fitzwilliam, 6&lt;/ref&gt; The rich tonal quality Rembrandt achieved in early etchings like ''Joseph and Potiphar's Wife'' was produced by his building dark areas with multiple overlays of hatched lines, gained through repeated work on successive states of the print.&lt;ref name="W"&gt;Ward, 204&lt;/ref&gt;

The original printing plate survives in a private collection. The changes between the two states are minor, with some extra touches being added to the bed and bedding.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;British Museum&lt;/ref&gt; Rembrandt made etchings of two earlier episodes in Joseph's story, in B 37 (1638) and B 38 (c. 1633), which are similar sizes but in a vertical "portrait" format.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, under those numbers.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Joy in the Morning''''' is a 1965 American film directed by [[Alex Segal]]. It was adapted from the 1963 [[Joy in the Morning (1963 novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Betty Smith]]. The film stars [[Richard Chamberlain]] as Carl Brown and [[Yvette Mimieux]] as Annie McGairy Brown. The musical score for the film is by [[Bernard Herrmann]], and the title song is sung by [[Richard Chamberlain]].

==Plot==
The story is set in the late 1920s, a time of rapidly changing social attitudes. Eighteen-year-old [[Brooklynite]] Annie McGairy has moved to [[the Midwest]] to marry her law-student love, Carl Brown. The couple must overcome many obstacles, including disapproval from their parents, who knew each other before emigrating to [[United States|America]] from [[Ireland]], financial problems, and Annie's sexual insecurities. These problems are all compounded when Annie discovers she is pregnant.

After a heated argument, Annie leaves Carl and returns to Brooklyn to live with her mother. She doesn't tell Carl she is pregnant because she doesn't want to burden him while he's working on his education.

Ultimately, Annie realizes that her family should be together, and Carl forgives her for leaving him because he believes that his child deserves happiness. The couple embraces at the train station and vow to stay together.

The '''Martinengo Altarpiece''' is a painting by the Italian [[High Renaissance]] painter [[Lorenzo Lotto]], finished in 1516. It is housed in the church of [[Santi Bartolomeo e Stefano (Bergamo)|Santi Bartolomeo e Stefano]] in [[Bergamo]] in northern Italy.

==History==
On 15 May 1516, Lotto was in Bergamo to sign a contract for a large altarpiece for the high altar of the church of San Bartolomeo, funded by Alessandro Martinengo Colleoni, who had chosen the church as the family's new burial place (the outstanding [[Colleoni Chapel]] is located nearby). It was finished three years later, as testified by the signature, and was paid 500 [[ducat (Italian coin)|ducats]].

The painting, the largest ever painted by Lotto, was once accompanied by a series of minor panels, which were dispersed in the following centuries and have been only partially identified - one is ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Lotto)|The Entombment of Christ]]'' (now in Bergamo).

==Description==
[[File:Lotto, pala martinengo 01.jpg|left|240px|thumb|Detail with an angel and the lion.]]
The subject of the painting is a [[Holy Conversation]], with the Virgin and the Child sitting on a throne surrounded by saints. The scene is set in a majestic architecture perhaps inspired by [[Bramante]] style. In the center, where the dome should be, is the [[tholobate]], whose pendentives decorated with Mark and John the Evangelists. Two angels are watching from a balaustrade, perhaps inspired by [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s [[Camera degli Sposi]]. Two other angels fly over Mary holding her crown.

The interpretation of the numerous symbols of the picture is disputed. Some of the objects could be taken from Francesco Colonna's ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'', alluding to the rule of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] in Bergamo, of which Martinengo was a supporter. The inscription in the upper part, saying ''Divina Suave'', would be a reference to Venice.

In the lower part, the Virgin sits on a throne having a zoomorphic base, whose lion paws are a reference to [[St. Mark's Lion]], symbol of Venice. The lion is also peeping from behind the throne, on the left. There is a total of ten saints, including St. Alexander, eponymous of the donor, portrayed with a scintillating armor and, perhaps, with the face of Martinengo himself. His wife Barbara is also portrayed next to him, as the saint with the same name.

The two child angels in the low foreground are a typical element in Lotto's works.

The work is signed and dated "Laurentius / Lotus / M.D.XVI".

'''Movie Theaters and hand painted Movie Posters in Ghana''' are a cultural component of this West African state.

== History ==
In the 1980s, thanks to the invention of video recorders, the first small cinemas came up in the Greater Accra Region in Ghana. In those years the cinemas were often mobile. Their operators used to travel in the whole region with a selection of movie cassettes, a TV set, a VCR and a generator, going from one village to the next to show their films. To draw attention to their performances, they announced them with colourful hand painted movie posters. These were provided by the local film distributors who collaborated with artists and sign painters like Daniel Anum Jasper, Heavy Jeaurs, Leonardo, Kwesi Blue, Salvation or Dallas who created for each movie a matching billboard.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe Ernie, Clive Barker: Extreme Canvas. Handpaintedd movie posters from Ghana. Los Angeles, Dilettante Press/Kesho Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sign painters ==
The artists and sign writers looked first at the films that were mostly made in Ghana or Nigeria, and then developed their film poster. For the mobile cinemas, these works had to be sturdy, cheap to produce, and light in weight because the cinema operators had to move around with the material. Therefore, the artists used a cheap, but very durable and light linen underlay which they gained from Ghanaian flour sacks. This material adhered very well with their oil and acrylic paints and the posters could even be hung outdoors when it rained. With their bright colors and an iconography adapted to the Ghanaian audiences, these paintings immediately caught the attention of the people and made them much more likely to go to the cinema than the normal posters that were printed in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Michelle: Shocking Images: Ghanaian Painted Posters. In: Ghana, Yesterday and Today, Musée Dapper 2003, pp.353-379.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New developments ==
Since Ghanaians now buy or rent their films on DVD and prefer to watch them at home, they no more go to the small cinemas. Most of the movie houses had to close in the recent years, and the few that are left can barely afford hand-painted movie posters, they rather use printed ones. Therefore, in the Region of Greater Accra, there are hardly any cinemas left who still use hand painted movie posters. Many artists who used to work for the film distributors have turned to other tasks. They are painting street signs that are still very popular in Ghana, and in the Greater Accra Region some are also assisting other artists like [[Paa Joe]] or [[Kudjoe Affutu]] in painting their [[Fantasy coffin|figurative coffins]], [[Figurative palanquin|palanquins]] and small sculptures. Some sign painters, such as Heavy J., Moses, Jasper, Farkira or Leonardo,&lt;ref&gt;Tschumi, Regula: Hors-Champs. Genèse de l'affiche de l'exposition. Exh. Cat. Hors-champs, Atelier PréTexte Neuchâtel, 2013, pp. 218-221.&lt;/ref&gt; also work for the international art market, where Ghanaian movie posters as well as the figurative coffins are shown in exhibitions of [[contemporary African art]] where they are getting more and more attention.&lt;ref&gt;Barlovic, Ingo, Wolfgang Stäbler: Faszinierende Werbekunst: Gemalte Filmplakate aus Ghana.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="69360">'''Music education''' is a field of study associated with the [[teaching]] and [[learning]] of [[music]].  It touches on all learning domains, including the psychomotor domain (the development of skills), the cognitive domain (the acquisition of knowledge), and, in particular and significant ways, the affective domain (the learner's willingness to receive, internalize, and share what is learned), including [[music appreciation]] and sensitivity.  Music training from preschool through post-secondary education is common in most nations because involvement with music is considered a fundamental component of human [[culture]] and [[human behavior|behavior]]. Cultures from around the world have different approaches to music education, largely due to the varying histories and politics. Studies show that teaching music from other cultures can help students perceive unfamiliar sounds more comfortably, and they also show that musical preference is related to the language spoken by the listener and the other sounds they are exposed to within their own culture.

During the 20th century, many distinctive approaches were developed or further refined for the teaching of music, some of which have had widespread impact. The Dalcroze method ([[eurhythmics]]) was developed in the early 20th century by [[Swiss people|Swiss]] musician and educator [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]]. The [[Kodály Method]] emphasizes the benefits of physical instruction and response to music. The [[Orff Schulwerk]] "approach" to music education leads students to develop their music abilities in a way that parallels the development of western music.

The [[Suzuki method]] creates the same environment for learning music that a person has for learning their native language.  Gordon Music Learning Theory provides the music teacher with a method for teaching musicianship through ''[[audiation]]'', Gordon's term for hearing music in the mind ''with understanding''. Conversational Solfège immerses students in the musical literature of their own culture, in this case American. The Carabo-Cone Method involves using props, costumes, and toys for children to learn basic musical concepts of staff, note duration, and the piano keyboard.  The concrete environment of the specially planned classroom allows the child to learn the fundamentals of music by exploring through touch.&lt;ref name="Madeleine"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED034358&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED034358|title=A Sensory-Motor Approach to Music Learning. Book I - Primary Concepts.|first=Carabo-Cone,|last=Madeleine|date=30 November 1968|website=ed.gov|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popular music pedagogy]] is the systematic teaching and learning of [[rock music]] and other forms of [[popular music]] both inside and outside formal classroom settings. Some have suggested that certain musical activities can help to improve breath, body and voice control of a child.&lt;ref&gt;Oaklander, Violet. (2006) Hidden Treasure : A Map to the Child's Inner Self. London,   Karnac Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[MMCP]] (Manhattanville Music Curriculum Project) aims to shape attitudes, helping students see music not as static content to be mastered, but as personal, current, and evolving. 

== Overview ==
In [[primary schools]] in [[Western world|European]] countries, children often learn to play instruments such as [[Music keyboard|keyboards]] or [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]], sing in small choirs, and learn about the elements of music and [[history of music]]. In countries such as [[India]], the [[harmonium]] is used in schools, but instruments like keyboards and violin are also common. Students are normally taught basics of [[Hindustani classical music|Indian Raga music]]. In [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s, students may often have the opportunity to perform in some type of [[musical ensemble]], such as a [[choir]], [[orchestra]], or [[school band]]: [[concert band]], [[marching band]], or [[jazz band]]. In some secondary schools, additional music classes may also be available. In [[junior high school]] or its equivalent, music usually continues to be a required part of the [[curriculum]].&lt;ref name="HDoM"&gt;Randel, D. (Ed.) (1986). Education in the United States. In '''''The New Harvard Dictionary of Music''''' (pp. 276–278). London/Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[university]] level, students in most arts and humanities programs receive academic credit for music courses such as music history, typically of Western art music, or [[music appreciation]], which focuses on listening and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities offer music ensembles – such as choir, concert band, marching band, or orchestra – that are open to students from various fields of study. Most universities also offer degree programs in music education, certifying students as primary and secondary music educators. Advanced degrees such as the [[D.M.A.]] or the [[Ph.D]] can lead to university employment. These degrees are awarded upon completion of music theory, music history, technique classes, private instruction with a specific instrument, ensemble participation, and in depth observations of experienced educators. Music education departments in North American and European universities also support interdisciplinary research in such areas as [[music psychology]], music education [[historiography]], educational [[ethnomusicology]], [[sociomusicology]], and [[International Society for Philosophy of Music Education|philosophy of education]].

The study of western art music is increasingly common in music education outside of North America and Europe, including Asian nations such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of outside the Western art music canon, including [[music of West Africa]], of Indonesia (e.g. [[Gamelan music]]), Mexico (e.g., [[mariachi]] music), Zimbabwe ([[marimba]] music), as well as [[popular music]].

Music education also takes place in individualized, lifelong learning, and in community contexts. Both amateur and professional musicians typically take [[music lessons]], short private sessions with an individual teacher.

==Instructional methodologies==
While instructional strategies are determined by the music teacher and the music [[curriculum]] in his or her area, many teachers rely heavily on one of many instructional [[methodology|methodologies]] that emerged in recent generations and developed rapidly during the latter half of the 20th Century.

===Major international music education methods===

====Dalcroze method====
{{Main|eurhythmics}}
The Dalcroze method was developed in the early 20th century by [[Swiss people|Swiss]] musician and educator [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]]. The method is divided into three fundamental concepts − the use of [[solfège]], improvisation, and [[eurhythmics]]. Sometimes referred to as "rhythmic gymnastics," eurhythmics teaches concepts of rhythm, structure, and musical expression using movement, and is the concept for which Dalcroze is best known. It focuses on allowing the student to gain physical awareness and experience of music through training that engages all of the senses, particularly kinesthetic. According to the Dalcroze method, music is the fundamental language of the human brain and therefore deeply connected to who we are. American proponents of the Dalcroze method include Ruth Alperson, Ann Farber, Herb Henke, Virginia Mead, Lisa Parker, Martha Sanchez, and Julia Schnebly-Black.  Many active teachers of Dalcroze method were trained by Dr. Hilda Schuster who was one of the students of Dalcroze.

====Kodály method====
{{Main|Kodály method}}
[[File:Curwen Hand Signs MT.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Curwen's Solfège hand signs. This version includes the tonal tendencies and interesting titles for each tone.]]
[[Zoltán Kodály]] (1882–1967) was a prominent [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] music educator and composer who stressed the benefits of physical instruction and response to music. Although not really an educational method, his teachings reside within a fun, educational framework built on a solid grasp of basic [[music theory]] and [[music notation]] in various verbal and written forms. Kodály's primary goal was to instill a lifelong love of music in his students and felt that it was the duty of the child's school to provide this vital element of education. Some of Kodály's trademark teaching methods include the use of [[solfège]] hand signs, musical shorthand notation (stick notation), and rhythm [[solmization]] (verbalization). Most countries have used their own folk music traditions to construct their own instruction sequence, but the United States primarily uses the Hungarian sequence. The work of Denise Bacon, Katinka S. Daniel, John Feierabend, Jean Sinor, Jill Trinka, and others brought Kodaly's ideas to the forefront of music education in the United States.

====Orff Schulwerk====
{{Main|Orff Schulwerk}}
[[Carl Orff]] was a prominent German composer. Orff Schulwerk is considered an "approach" to music education. It begins with a student's innate abilities to engage in rudimentary forms of music, using basic rhythms and melodies. Orff considers the whole body a percussive instrument and students are led to develop their music abilities in a way that parallels the development of western music. The approach fosters student self-discovery, encourages improvisation, and discourages adult pressures and mechanical drill. [[Carl Orff]] developed a special group of instruments, including modifications of the [[glockenspiel]], [[xylophone]], [[metallophone]], [[drum]], and other [[percussion instrument]]s to accommodate the requirements of the Schulwerk courses. Experts in shaping an American-style Orff approach include Jane Frazee, Arvida Steen, and Judith Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/orff-approach-emc/ "Orff Approach"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''.  Doreen Hall, Keith Bissell, Emily-Jane Orford. 02/07/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suzuki method====
{{Main|Suzuki method}}
The Suzuki method was developed by [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Shinichi Suzuki]] in Japan shortly after World War II, and uses music education to enrich the lives and [[moral character]] of its students.  The movement rests on the double premise that "all children can be well educated" in music, and that learning to play music at a high level also involves learning certain character traits or virtues which make a person's soul more beautiful.  The primary method for achieving this is centered around creating the same environment for learning music that a person has for learning their native language.  This 'ideal' environment includes love, high-quality examples, praise, rote training and repetition, and a time-table set by the student's developmental readiness for learning a particular technique. While the Suzuki Method is quite popular internationally, within Japan its influence is less significant than the Yamaha Method, founded by [[Genichi Kawakami]] in association with the [[Yamaha Music Foundation]].

===Other notable methods===
In addition to the four major international methods described above, other approaches have been influential. Lesser-known methods are described below:

====Gordon's Music Learning Theory====
{{Main|Gordon Music Learning Theory}}
Edwin Gordon's Music Learning Theory is based on an extensive body of research and field testing by Edwin E. Gordon and others in the larger field of [[Music Learning Theory]]. It provides music teachers with a comprehensive framework for teaching musicianship through [[Gordon Music Learning Theory#audiation|audiation]], Gordon's term for hearing music in the mind with understanding and comprehension when the sound is not physically present.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Azzara, Audiation, Improvisation, and Music Learning Theory. 1991, The Quarterly, 2(1–2), 106–109.&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of instructions is Discrimination Learning and Inference Learning. Discrimination Learning, the ability to determine whether two elements are the same or not the same using aural/oral, verbal association, partial synthesis, symbolic association, and composite synthesis. Inference Learning, students take an active role in their own education and learn to identify, create, and improvise unfamiliar patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Willie J. |title=Gordon's Music Learning on Piano |url=https://pianoin21days.com/how-to-play-piano/ |website=PI21 |publisher=Owensboro |accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skills and content sequences within the Audiation theory help music teachers establish sequential curricular objectives in accord with their own teaching styles and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giml.org/home.php GIML: The Gordon Institute for Music Learning&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824082226/http://www.giml.org/home.php |date=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There also is a Learning Theory for Newborns and Young Children in which the Types and Stages of Preparatory Audiation are outlined.

====World Music Pedagogy====
The growth of cultural diversity within school-age populations prompted music educators from the 1960s onward to diversify the music curriculum, and to work with ethnomusicologists and artist-musicians to establish instructional practices rooted in musical traditions.  'World music pedagogy' was coined by [[Patricia Shehan Campbell]] to describe world music content and practice in elementary and secondary school music programs.  Pioneers of the movement, especially Barbara Reeder Lundquist, William M. Anderson, and Will Schmid, influenced a second generation of music educators (including J. Bryan Burton, Mary Goetze, Ellen McCullough-Brabson, and Mary Shamrock) to design and deliver curricular models to music teachers of various levels and specializations. The pedagogy advocates the use of human resources, i.e., "culture-bearers," as well as deep and continued listening to archived resources such as those of Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Patricia Shehan, Teaching Music Globally (Oxford University Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conversational Solfège====
Influenced by both the Kodály method and Gordon's Music Learning Theory, Conversational Solfège was developed by Dr. John M. Feierabend, former chair of music education at the [[Hartt School]], [[University of Hartford]].  The program begins by immersing students in the musical literature of their own culture, in this case American.  Music is seen as separate from, and more fundamental than, notation.  In twelve learning stages, students move from hearing and singing music to decoding and then creating music using spoken syllables and then standard written notation. Rather than implementing the Kodály method directly, this method follows Kodály's original instructions and builds on America's own folk songs instead of on Hungarian folk songs.

==== Carabo-Cone Method ====
This early-childhood approach, sometimes referred to as the Sensory-Motor Approach to Music, was developed by the violinist Madeleine Carabo-Cone.  This approach involves using props, costumes, and toys for children to learn basic musical concepts of staff, note duration, and the piano keyboard.  The concrete environment of the specially planned classroom allows the child to learn the fundamentals of music by exploring through touch.&lt;ref name="Madeleine"/&gt;

====Popular Music Pedagogy====
{{Main|Popular music pedagogy}}
'Popular music pedagogy' — alternatively called rock music pedagogy, modern band, popular music education, or rock music education — is a recent development in music education consisting of the systematic teaching and learning of [[rock music]] and other forms of [[popular music]] both inside and outside formal classroom settings. Popular music pedagogy tends to emphasize group improvisation,&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Lee and Campbell, Patricia Shehan, Free to be Musical: Group Improvisation in Music (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and is more commonly associated with community music activities than fully institutionalized school music ensembles.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Lee, Community Music: In Theory and in Practice (Oxford University Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== MMCP ====
{{Main|MMCP}}
The Manhattanville Music Curriculum Project was developed in 1965 as a response to declining student interest in school music. This creative approach aims to shape attitudes, helping students see music not as static content to be mastered, but as personal, current, and evolving.  Rather than imparting factual knowledge, this method centers around the student, who learns through investigation, experimentation, and discovery.  The teacher gives a group of students a specific problem to solve together and allows freedom to create, perform, improvise, conduct, research, and investigate different facets of music in a spiral curriculum. MMCP is viewed as the forerunner to projects in creative music composition and improvisation activities in schools.

==History of music education in the United States==

===18th century===
After the preaching of Reverend Thomas Symmes, the first singing school was created in 1717 in [[Boston]]  for the purposes of improving singing and music reading in the church. These singing schools gradually spread throughout the colonies.  Music education continued to flourish with the creation of the Academy of Music in Boston. Reverend John Tufts published ''An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes Using Non-Traditional Notation'' which is regarded as the first music textbook in the colonies. Between 1700 and 1820, more than 375 tune books would be published by such authors as Samuel Holyoke, Francis Hopkinson, William Billings, and Oliver Holden.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201838/http://www.bsu.edu/classes/bauer/hpmused/colonial.html The Colonial Period: 1600-1800] - Timeline: Music Education History/Philosophy (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

Music began to spread as a curricular subject into other school districts. Soon after music expanded to all grade levels and the teaching of music reading was improved until the music curriculum grew to include several activities in addition to music reading. By the end of 1864 public school music had spread throughout the country.

===19th century===
In 1832, [[Lowell Mason]] and George Webb formed the [[Boston Academy of Music]] with the purposes of teaching singing and theory as well as methods of teaching music.  Mason published his ''Manuel of Instruction'' in 1834 which was based upon the music education works of Pestalozzian System of Education founded by Swiss educator [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]].  This handbook gradually became used by many singing school teachers. From 1837–1838, the Boston School Committee allowed Lowell Mason to teach music in the Hawes School as a demonstration.  This is regarded as the first time music education was introduced to public schools in the United States.  In 1838 the Boston School Committee approved the inclusion of music in the curriculum and Lowell Mason became the first recognized supervisor of elementary music.  In later years [[Luther Whiting Mason]] became the Supervisor of Music in Boston and spread music education into all levels of public education (grammar, primary, and high school).  During the middle of the 19th century, Boston became the model to which many other cities across the United States included and shaped their public school music education programs.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Martha Chrisman, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3344928 "Portrait of a Nineteenth-Century School Music Program"], Journal of Research in Music Education, Vol. 38, No. 2 (Summer, 1990), pp. 79–89, MENC: The National Association for Music Education&lt;/ref&gt; Music methodology for teachers as a course was first introduced in the [[Normal School]] in Potsdam. The concept of classroom teachers in a school that taught music under the direction of a music supervisor was the standard model for public school music education during this century. (See also: ''[[Music education in the United States]]'') While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, "later, it was accepted that [[Women in music|women would have a role in music education]], and they became involved in this field...to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt;

===Early 20th century===
In the United States, teaching colleges with four-year degree programs developed from the Normal Schools and included music.  [[Oberlin Conservatory]] first offered the Bachelor of Music Education degree. Osbourne G. McCarthy, an American music educator, introduced details for studying music for credit in Chelsea High School.  Notable events in the history of music education in the early 20th century also include:
* Founding of the Music Supervisor's National Conference (changed to Music Educators National Conference in 1934, later [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education]] in 1998, and currently [http://nafme.org/ The National Association for Music Education – NAfME]) in [[Keokuk, Iowa]] in 1907.
* Rise of the school band and orchestra movement leading to performance oriented school music programs.
* Growth in music [[method (music)|methods]] publications.
* [[Frances Elliot Clark]] develops and promotes phonograph record libraries for school use.
* [[Carl Seashore]] and his ''Measures of Musical Talent'' music aptitude test starts testing people in music.

Music course offerings and even entire degree programs in [[online music education]] developed in the first decade of the 21st century at various institutions, and the fields of [[world music pedagogy]] and [[popular music pedagogy]] have also seen notable expansion.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, social aspects of teaching and learning music came to the fore. This emerged as praxial music education,&lt;ref&gt;http://bern.library.nenu.edu.cn/upload/soft/0000/11.1goble{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[1].pdf&lt;/ref&gt; critical theory,&lt;ref&gt;http://users.rider.edu/~vrme/v6n1/visions/Regelski%20Critical%20Theory%20as%20a%20Foundation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and feminist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/1461380032000182849 | volume=6 | title=Feminist theory in music education research: grrl‐illa games as nomadic practice (or how music education fell from grace) | journal=Music Education Research | pages=67–79| year=2007 | last1=Gould | first1=Elizabeth }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of importance are the colloquia and journals of the MayDay Group, "an international think tank of music educators that aims to identify, critique, and change taken-for-granted patterns of professional activity, polemical approaches to method and philosophy, and educational politics and public pressures that threaten effective practice and critical communication in music education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maydaygroup.org/about-us/|title=About the MayDay Group – Mayday Group|author=|date=|website=www.maydaygroup.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a new focus on social aspects of music education, scholars have analyzed critical aspects such as music and race,&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Bradley5_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; gender,&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Lamb3_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; class,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0027432112442944 | volume=98 | issue=4 | title=Social Class and School Music | journal=Music Educators Journal | pages=33–37| year=2012 | last1=Bates | first1=Vincent C }}&lt;/ref&gt; institutional belonging,&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Froehlich6_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Bates10_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
Institutional music education was started in colonial India by [[Rabindranath Tagore]] after he founded the [[Visva-Bharati University]]. At present, most universities have a faculty of music with some universities specially dedicated to fine arts such as [[Indira Kala Sangeet University]], [[Swathi Thirunal College of Music]] or [[Rabindra Bharati University]].[[Indian classical music]] is based on the [[Guru Shishya parampara|gurushyshyaparampara]] system. The [[teacher]], known as [[Guru]], transmit the musical knowledge to the student, or shyshya. This is still the main system used in [[India]] to transmit musical knowledge. Although European art music became popularized in schools throughout much of the world during the twentieth century (East Asia, Latin America, Oceania, Africa), India remains one of the few highly populated nations in which non-European indigenous music traditions have consistently received relatively greater emphasis. That said, there is certainly much western influence in the popular music associated with [[Bollywood]] film scores.

==Africa==
The [[South African Department of Education]] and the ILAM Music Heritage Project SA teach African music using western musical framework. ILAM's ''Listen and Learn'' for students 11–14 is "unique" in teaching curriculum requirements for western music using recordings of traditional African music.&lt;ref&gt;''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology'' ed. Jonathan McCollum and [[David G. Hebert]], p.325&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time that Africa was colonized up to 1994, indigenous music and arts being taught in schools was a rare occurrence. The African National Congress (ANC) attempted to repair the neglect of indigenous knowledge and the overwhelming emphasis on written musical literacy in schools. It is not well known that the learning of indigenous music actually has a philosophy and teaching procedure that is different from western “formal” training. It involves the whole community because indigenous songs are about the history of its people. After the colonization of Africa, music became more centered on Christian beliefs and European folk songs, rather than the more improvised and fluid indigenous music.  Before the major changes education went through from 1994 to 2004, during the first decade of the democratic government, teachers were trained as classroom teachers and told that they would have to incorporate music into other subject areas. The few colleges with teaching programs that included instrumental programs held a greater emphasis on music theory, history of western music, western music notation, and less on making music. Up until 1999, most college syllabi did not include training in indigenous South African Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbst|first1=Anri|last2=de Wet|first2=Jacques|last3=Rijsdijk|first3=Susan|title=A Survey of Music Education in the Primary Schools of South Africa's Cape Peninsula|journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|date=2005|volume=53|issue=3|pages=260–283|doi=10.2307/3598684|jstor=3598684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In African cultures music is seen as a community experience and is used for social and religious occasions. As soon as children show some sign of being able to handle music or a musical instrument they are allowed to participate with the adults of the community in musical events. Traditional songs are more important to many people because they are stories about the histories of the indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nketia|first1=J. H. Kwabena|title=Music Education in Africa and the West: We Can Learn from Each Other|journal=Music Educators Journal|date=1970|volume=57|issue=3|pages=48–55|doi=10.2307/3392906|jstor=3392906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South America==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
Among the Aztecs, Mayans, and Incas, music was used in ceremonies and rituals to teach the history of their civilizations and was also used for worship. The Aztec people were mainly educated by their priests. Music remained an important way to teach religion and history and was taught by priests for many centuries.  When Spain and Portugal colonized parts of South America, music started to be influenced by European ideas and qualities. Several priests of European descent, such as Antonio Sepp, taught European systems of music notation and theory based on their knowledge of playing instruments throughout the 1700-1800s. Since music was taught to the general public by rote, very few knew how to read music other than those who played instruments until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  The development of music in South America mainly followed that of European development. Choirs were formed to sing masses, chants, psalms, but secular music also became more prevalent in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Couve|first1=Alicia C.|last2=Pino|first2=Claudia Dal|last3=Frega|first3=Ana Lucía|title=An Approach to the History of Music Education in Latin America|jstor=40214944|journal=The Bulletin of Historical Research in Music Education|pages=10–39|doi=10.2307/40214944|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music education in Latin America today has large emphasis on folk music, masses, and orchestral music. Many classrooms teach their choirs to sing in their native language as well as in English. Several Latin American Schools, specifically in Puerto Rico and Haiti, believe music to be an important subject and are working on expanding their programs. Outside of school, many communities form their own musical groups and organizations. Community performances are very popular with the local audiences. There are a few well-known Latin American choral groups, such as "El Coro de Madrigalistas" from Mexico. This famous choral group tours around Mexico, showing students around the country what a professional choral ensemble sounds like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawler|first1=Vanett|title=Music Education in Fourteen Latin-American Republics|jstor=3386758|journal=Music Educators Journal|pages=20–30|doi=10.2307/3386758|date=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-Cultural Music Education==
The music, languages, and sounds we are exposed to within our own cultures determine our tastes in music and affect the way we perceive the music of other cultures. Many studies have shown distinct differences in the preferences and abilities of musicians from around the world. One study attempted to view the distinctions between the musical preferences of English and Japanese speakers, providing both groups of people with the same series of tones and rhythms. The same type of study was done for English and French speakers. Both studies suggested that the language spoken by the listener determined which groupings of tones and rhythms were more appealing, based on the inflections and natural rhythm groupings of their language.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bicknell|first1=Jeanette|title=Cross-Cultural Research and the Nature of Music|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/why-music-moves-us/201303/cross-cultural-research-and-the-nature-music|website=Psychology Today|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study had Europeans and Africans try to tap along with certain rhythms. European rhythms are regular and built on simple ratios, while African rhythms are typically based on irregular ratios. While both groups of people could perform the rhythms with European qualities, the European group struggled with the African rhythms. This has to do with the ubiquity of complex polyrhythm in African culture and their familiarity with this type of sound.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

While each culture has its own musical qualities and appeals, incorporating cross-cultural curricula in our music classrooms can help teach students how to better perceive music from other cultures. Studies show that learning to sing folk songs or popular music of other cultures is an effective way to understand a culture as opposed to merely learning about it. If music classrooms discuss the musical qualities and incorporate styles from other cultures, such as the Brazilian roots of the Bossa Nova, the Afro-Cuban clave, and African drumming, it will expose students to new sounds and teach them how to compare their cultures’ music to the different music and start to make them more comfortable with exploring sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilari|first1=Beatriz|last2=Chen-Hafteck|first2=Lily|last3=Crawford|first3=Lisa|title=Singing and cultural understanding: A music education perspective|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0255761413487281|website=International Journal of Music Education|pages=202–216|language=en|doi=10.1177/0255761413487281|date=1 May 2013|volume=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards and assessment==
Achievement standards are curricular statements used to guide educators in determining objectives for their teaching. Use of standards became a common practice in many nations during the 20th century. For much of its existence, the curriculum for music education in the United States was determined locally or by individual teachers. In recent decades there has been a significant move toward adoption of regional and/or national standards. [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education]], created nine voluntary content standards, called the ''National Standards for Music Education''.{{ref|standardfoot}} These standards call for:
# [[Singing]], alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music.
# [[Performing]] on instruments, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music.
# [[Improvising]] melodies, variations, and accompaniments.
# [[Musical composition|Composing]] and arranging music within specified guidelines.
# [[Reading (activity)|Reading]] and notating music.
# Listening to, analyzing, and describing music.
# Evaluating music and music performances.
# Understanding relationships between music, the other arts, and disciplines outside the arts.
# Understanding music in relation to history and culture.

Many states and school districts have adopted their own standards for music education.

==Integration with other subjects==
[[File:2013 Orgelkids Doe-orgel pijpen plaatsen.jpg|thumb|200px|Children in primary school are assembling a do-organ of [[Orgelkids]]]]
Some schools and organizations promote integration of arts classes, such as music, with other subjects, such as math, science, or English, believing that integrating the different curricula will help each subject to build off of one another, enhancing the overall quality of education.

One example is the [[Kennedy Center]]'s "Changing Education Through the Arts" program. CETA defines arts integration as finding a natural connection(s) between one or more art forms (dance, drama/theater, music, visual arts, storytelling, puppetry, and/or creative writing) and one or more other curricular areas (science, social studies, English language arts, mathematics, and others) in order to teach and assess objectives in both the art form and the other subject area. This allows a simultaneous focus on creating, performing, and/or responding to the arts while still addressing content in other subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://surfaquarium.com/ceta.htm CETA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512034843/http://www.surfaquarium.com/ceta.htm |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]] has funded three projects that use music to support language learning. Lullabies of Europe (for pre-school and early learners),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lullabies-of-europe.org/ Lullabies of Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; FolkDC (for primary),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folkdc.eu/|title=home|author=|date=11 February 2011|website=folkdc.eu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the recent PopuLLar (for secondary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/PopuLLar-Music-and-Language-Learning/181858685219155|title=PopuLLar - Music and Language Learning|author=|date=|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ARTinED project is also using music for all subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artined.eu/home.html|title=ARTinED - A new approach to education using the arts|author=|date=|website=www.artined.eu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance===

A number of researchers and music education advocates have argued that studying music enhances [[academic achievement]],&lt;ref&gt;"Multiple studies link music study to academic achievement." [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/opinion/sunday/is-music-the-key-to-success.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=ISMR_AP_LO_MST_FB&amp;_r=0 Joanne Lipman, New York Times]. October 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; such as William Earhart, former president of the Music Educators National Conference, who claimed that "Music enhances knowledge in the areas of mathematics, science, geography, history, foreign language, physical education, and vocational training."&lt;ref name="Morrison, Steven J 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morrison | first1 = Steven J | year = 1994 | title = Music students and academic growth | url = | journal = Music Educators Journal | volume = 81 | issue = 2| pages = 33–36 | doi=10.2307/3398812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the University of Wisconsin suggested that students with piano or keyboard experience performed 34% higher on tests that measure spatial-temporal lobe activity, which is the part of the brain that is used when doing mathematics, science, and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rauscher | first1 = F. | last2 = Zupan | first2 = M.A. | year = 2000 | title = Classroom Keyboard Instruction Improves Kindergarten Children's Spatial-Temporal Performance: A Field Experiment | url = | journal = Early Childhood Research Quarterly | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 215–228 | doi=10.1016/s0885-2006(00)00050-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment by Wanda T. Wallace setting text to melody suggested that some music may aid in text recall.&lt;ref name="Wallace, W. 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wallace | first1 = W | year = 1994 | title = Memory for music: Effect of melody on recall of text | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 1471–1485 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.20.6.1471}}&lt;/ref&gt; She created a three verse song with a non-repetitive melody; each verse with different music.  A second experiment created a three verse song with a repetitive melody; each verse had exactly the same music.  A third experiment studied text recall without music.  She found the repetitive music produced the highest amount of text recall, suggesting music can serve as a mnemonic device.&lt;ref name="Wallace, W. 1994"/&gt;

Smith (1985) studied background music with word lists.  One experiment involved memorizing a word list with background music; participants recalled the words 48 hours later.  Another experiment involved memorizing a word list with no background music; participants also recalled the words 48 hours later.  Participants who memorized word lists with background music recalled more words demonstrating music provides contextual cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = S | year = 1985 | title = Background music and context-dependent memory | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 4| pages = 591–603 | doi=10.2307/1422512| jstor = 1422512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing studies that support music education's involvement in intellectual development and academic achievement, the United States Congress passed a resolution declaring that: "Music education enhances intellectual development and enriches the academic environment for children of all ages; and Music educators greatly contribute to the artistic, intellectual and social development of American children and play a key role in helping children to succeed in school."&lt;ref&gt;(H. Res. 266)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bobbett (1990) suggests that most public school music programs have not changed since their inception at the turn of the last century. "…the educational climate is not conducive to their continuance as historically conceived and the social needs and habits of people require a completely different kind of band program."&lt;ref&gt;Bobbett, G. C. (1990). Rural Appalachian Band Directors' Academic Preparation: Musical Preparation, Facilities, Monetary Resources, and Methods of Student Evaluation, and Their Students' Musical Independence. [S.l.]: Distributed by ERIC Clearinghouse.&lt;/ref&gt;    A 2011 study conducted by Kathleen M. Kerstetter for the Journal of Band Research found that increased non-musical graduation requirements, block scheduling, increased number of non-traditional programs such as magnet schools, and the testing emphases created by the No Child Left Behind Act are only some of the concerns facing music educators. Both teachers and students are under increased time restrictions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kerstetter | first1 = Kathleen M | year = 2011 | title = Investigating High School Band Recruitment Procedures Using Educational Marketing Principles | url = | journal = Journal of Band Research | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 1–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Patricia Powers states, "It is not unusual to see program cuts in the area of music and arts when economic issues surface.  It is indeed unfortunate to lose support in this area especially since music and the art programs contribute to society in many positive ways." &lt;ref name="Morrison, Steven J 1994" /&gt; Comprehensive music education programs average $187 per pupil, according to a 2011 study funded by the national Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fermanich | first1 = M. L. | year = 2011 | title = Money for music education: a district analysis of the how, what, and where of spending for music education | url = | journal = Journal of Education Finance | volume = 37 | issue = 2| page = 130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Texas Commission on Drugs and Alcohol Abuse Report noted that students who participated in band or orchestra reported the lowest lifetime and current use of all substances including alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensmusicworkshop.com/advocacy/benefits.html|title=Benefits of Music Education - How do students benefit from music?|author=|date=|website=childrensmusicworkshop.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-musical benefits===
Studies have shown that music education can be used to enhance cognitive achievement in students. In the United States an estimated 30% of students struggle with reading, while 17% are reported as having a specific learning disability linked to reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Register | first1 = D. | last2 = Darrow | first2 = A.A | last3 = Swedberd | first3 = O. | last4 = Standley | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = The use of music to enhance reading skills of second grade students and students with reading disabilities | url = | journal = Journal of Music Therapy | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 23–37 | doi=10.1093/jmt/44.1.23| pmid = 17419662 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using intensive music curriculum as an intervention paired alongside regular classroom activities, research shows that students involved with the music curriculum show increases in reading comprehension, word knowledge, vocabulary recall, and word decoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Register | first1 = D. | last2 = Darrow | first2 = A.A | last3 = Swedberd | first3 = O. | last4 = Standley | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = The use of music to enhance reading skills of second grade students and students with reading disabilities | url = | journal = Journal of Music Therapy | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 23–37 | pmid = 17419662 | doi=10.1093/jmt/44.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a student is singing a melody with text, they are using multiple areas of their brain to multitask. Music effects language development, increases IQ, spatial-temporal skills, and improves test scores. Music education has also shown to improve the skills of dyslexic children in similar areas as mentioned earlier by focusing on visual auditory and fine motor skills as strategies to combat their disability.&lt;ref&gt;Overy, K. (2000). Dyslexia, temporal processing and music: The potential of music as an early learning aid for dyslexic children. Psychology of Music 28(2). 218–229.&lt;/ref&gt; Since research in this area is sparse, we cannot convincingly conclude these findings to be true, however the results from research done do show a positive impact on both students with learning difficulties and those who are not diagnosed. Further research will need to be done, but the positive engaging way of bringing music into the classroom cannot be forgotten, and the students generally show a positive reaction to this form of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butzlaff | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = Can music be used to teach reading? | url = | journal = The Journal of Aesthetic Education | volume = 34 | issue = 3/4| pages = 167–178 | doi=10.2307/3333642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music education has also been noted to have the ability to increase someones overall IQ, especially in children during peak development years.&lt;ref name="Schellenberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schellenberg | first1 = E.G. | year = 2004 | title = Music lessons enhance IQ | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 8| pages = 511–514 | doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00711.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spacial ability, verbal memory, reading and mathematic ability are seen to be increased alongside music education (primarily through the learning of an instrument).&lt;ref name="Schellenberg"/&gt; Researchers also note that a correlation between general attendance and IQ increases is evident, and due to students involvement in music education, general attendance rates increase along with their IQ.

Fine motor skills, social behaviours, and emotional well being can also be increased through music and music education. The learning of an instrument increases fine motor skills in students with physical disabilities. Emotional well being can be increased as students find meaning in songs and connect them to their everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosacki | first1 = S. | last2 = O'Neill | first2 = S. | year = 2013 | title = Early adolescents' emotional perceptions and engagement with popular music activities in everyday life | url = | journal = International Journal of Adolescence and Youth | volume =  20| issue = 2| pages =  228–244| doi = 10.1080/02673843.2013.785438 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through social interactions of playing in groups like jazz and concert bands, students learn to socialize and this can be linked to emotional and mental well being.

===Music advocacy===
In some communities – and even entire national education systems – music is provided little support as an academic subject area, and music teachers feel that they must actively seek greater public endorsement for music education as a legitimate subject of study. This perceived need to change public opinion has resulted in the development of a variety of approaches commonly called "music advocacy". Music advocacy comes in many forms, some of which are based upon legitimate scholarly arguments and scientific findings, while other examples controversially rely on emotion, anecdotes, or unconvincing data.

Recent high-profile music advocacy projects include the "[[Mozart Effect]]", the [[National Anthem Project]], and the movement in  [[World Music Pedagogy]] (also known as  [[Cultural Diversity in Music Education]]) which seeks out means of equitable pedagogy across students regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic circumstance.  The Mozart effect is particularly controversial as while the initial study suggested listening to Mozart positively impacts [[spatial-temporal reasoning]], later studies either failed to replicate the results,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chabris | first1 = Christopher F | year = 1999 | title = Prelude or requiem for the 'Mozart effect'? | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 400 | issue = 6747| pages = 826–827 | doi = 10.1038/23608 | pmid = 10476958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steele | first1 = Kenneth M. | last2 = Bass | first2 = Karen E. | last3 = Crook | first3 = Melissa D. | year = 1999 | title = The Mystery of the Mozart Effect: Failure to Replicate | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 366–369 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.00169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested no effect on IQ or spatial ability,&lt;ref&gt;Rudi Črnčec, Sarah J. Wilson and Margot Prior, "No Evidence for the Mozart Effect in Children," ''Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Vol. 23, No. 4 (2006): 305–318. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/mp.2006.23.4.305]&lt;/ref&gt; or suggested the music of Mozart could be substituted for any music children enjoy in a term called "enjoyment arousal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = W.F. | last2 = Schellenberg | first2 = E.G. | last3 = Husain | first3 = G. | year = 2001 | title = Mood, arousal, and the Mozart effect | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 248–251 | doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggested that even if listening to Mozart may temporarily enhance a student's spatial-temporal abilities, learning to play an instrument is much more likely to improve student performance and achievement.&lt;ref&gt;(Rauscher, F. H., &amp; Hinton, S. C. (2006). The Mozart Effect: Music Listening is Not Music Instruction. Educational Psychologist, 41(4), 233–238.  Abstract: This paper clarifies the position of the author's earlier works.)&lt;/ref&gt; Educators similarly criticized the [[National Anthem Project]] not only for promoting the educational use of music as a tool for non-musical goals, but also for its links to [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Bradley, "Oh That Magic Feeling! Multicultural Human Subjectivity, Community, and Fascism's Footprints," ''Philosophy of Music Education Review,'' Vol. 17, No. 1 (2009): 56, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary music scholars assert that effective music advocacy uses empirically sound arguments that transcend political motivations and personal agendas. [[International Society for Philosophy of Music Education|Music education philosophers]] such as [[Bennett Reimer]], [[Estelle Jorgensen]], [[David J. Elliott]], [[John Paynter (composer)|John Paynter]], and [[Keith Swanwick]] support this view, yet many music teachers and music organizations and schools do not apply this line of reasoning into their music advocacy arguments. Researchers such as [[Ellen Winner]] conclude that arts advocates have made bogus claims to the detriment of defending the study of music,&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Wu, "Entrepreneurship in Research: Ellen Winner on Why We Need the Arts," ''Entrepreneurship Review,'' (2013): [2 http://miter.mit/edu/ellen-winner-on-why-we-need-the-arts/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}]&lt;/ref&gt; her research debunking claims that music education improves math, for example.&lt;ref name="David J 2015"&gt;David J. Elliot and Marissa Silverman, Music Matters, A Philosophy of Music Education, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015), 38&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers [[Glenn Schellenberg]] and [[Eugenia Costa-Giomi]] also criticize advocates [[Correlation does not imply causation|incorrectly associating correlation with causation]], Giomi pointing out that while there is a "strong relationship between music participation and academic achievement, the ''causal'' nature of the relationship is questionable."&lt;ref name="David J 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugenia Costa-Giomi, "Music Education and Intellectual Development in Children: Historical, Research, and Educational Perspectives," 2012, Conference Proceeding, Anais Do II Simpom 2012 – Simposio Brasileiro de Pos-Graduandos Em Musica, 21, [http://www.seer.unirio.br/index.php/simpom/article/viewFile/2601/1929]&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers [[David J. Elliott|David Elliott]] and [[Marissa Silverman]] suggest that more effective advocacy involves shying away from "[[dumbing down]]" values and aims through slogans and misleading data, energy being better focused into engaging potential supporters in active music-making and musical-affective experiences,&lt;ref&gt;David J. Elliott and Marissa Silverman, Music Matters, A Philosophy of Music Education, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015), 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; these actions recognizing that music and music-making are inherent to human culture and behavior, distinguishing humans from other species.&lt;ref name="Yudkin, J. 2008 p. 4"&gt;Yudkin, J. (2008). Understanding Music (p. 4). Upper Saddle River, NJ:Pearson/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of women==
{{Main|Women in music education}}
[[File:Roman Catholic Elementary School- Life at St Joseph's, Upper Norwood, 1943 D14456.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A music teacher leading a music ensemble in an elementary school in 1943.]]
While music critics argued in the 1880s that "...[[Women in music|women]] [composers] lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to "biological predisposition",&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php|title=Women Composers In American Popular Song, Page 1|author=|date=|website=parlorsongs.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, it was accepted that women would have a role in music education, and they became involved in this field "...to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt;"Traditional accounts of the history of music education [in the US] have often neglected the contributions of women, because these texts have emphasized bands and the top leaders in hierarchical music organizations." &lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking beyond these bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "...home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "...as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations." &lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"/&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on women's roles in music education in the 19th century, women were accepted as [[kindergarten]] teachers, because this was deemed to be a "private sphere". Women also taught music privately, in girl's schools, Sunday schools, and they trained musicians in school music programs. By the turn of the 20th century, women began to be employed as music supervisors in elementary schools, teachers in [[normal school]]s and professors of music in universities. Women also became more active in professional organizations in music education, and women presented papers at conferences. A woman, Frances Clarke (1860-1958) founded the [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors National Conference]] in 1907. While a small number of women served as President of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female Presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination."

After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female Presidents of this organization.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bigbadbariguru/a-historical-view-of-women-in-music-education-careers|title=A historical view of women in music education careers|first=|last=bigbadbariguru|date=5 July 2012|website=slideshare.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction .&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; More men tend to be hired as for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "[[glass ceiling]]" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt;

== Plot ==
[[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], 1963: Bob Ivanovich, a young son of [[Ukrainian-American]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-12/entertainment/ca-55854_1_real-life Looking for Meaning of 'Life' by KENNETH TURAN] - LA Times, November 12, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/mylifepg13kempley_a0a3d3.htm ‘My Life’ (PG-13) By Rita Kempley] - Washington Post, November 12, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; parents, prays one night for a [[circus]] in his backyard the next day after school. After school the next day, he runs home eagerly, followed by his friends. To his disappointment, no [[circus]] awaits. Angrily, Bob retreats to the closet in his room, his personal retreat space.

Bob has shunned his Ukrainian-born parents for their immigrant ways and decided to move away from his family in Detroit.&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt; Thirty years later, Bob Jones ([[Michael Keaton|Keaton]]) now runs a [[Los Angeles]] public relations firm. He is happily married to Gail ([[Nicole Kidman|Kidman]]), who is pregnant with their first child. Bob is horrified to learn that he has been diagnosed with a terminal form of [[kidney cancer]] and might not live to see their baby born.

Bob begins to make home movies, to immortalize himself, to be shown after his death to his son, so he'll know who his father was, showing him how to cook [[spaghetti]], how to drive, etc. He also begins to visit a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] healer named Mr. Ho (Dr. [[Haing S. Ngor]]), who urges him to listen to his heart, which is calling him to forgive, and that life is always giving him invitations if he would just listen. At his wife's urging, they fly to his hometown of Detroit to attend a traditional Ukrainian wedding of his brother Paul ([[Bradley Whitford|Whitford]]). While in the area, Bob visits his childhood home. Also while there, they attempt to mend fences with his estranged family, which does not go well. Bob criticizes his brother for not moving to [[California]] like he did, and his father ([[Michael Constantine|Constantine]]) resents Bob's moving thousands of miles away and changing his name.

Bob returns to [[California]] with a heavy heart, sadly saying to his wife, "This is my last trip home." During a visit with Mr. Ho, he advises Bob to go into his heart "soon." Bob teaches his son by camera how to shave, play basketball, and start a car by jumper cable. He also confronts a childhood fear by finally riding a formidable [[roller coaster]]. During the ride, a young companion urges him to let go of the railing as the descent begins, but Bob firmly holds on. (A metaphor of his fear of letting go of life.) He is living on borrowed time—beyond the date the doctors gave him, as he says to his wife after getting off the [[Roller coaster|coaster]], "Today is D-Day. Death Day. I was supposed to be [[Death|dead]] by today."

Gail's contractions increase, and soon she is in the hospital, to give birth to their baby. Bob and Gail have a happy time with their newborn, but soon Bob's condition worsens, now that the [[cancer]] has reached his brain. [[Hospice]] care is arranged for Bob. Bob makes a final visit to Mr. Ho, and asks him what the light is he keeps seeing. Mr. Ho replies it is "the life of the self" and urges him to get his "house in order (life and personal affairs)."

A [[hospice]] nurse, Theresa ([[Queen Latifah]]), moves in to help, but Bob is sinking fast. Bob and Gail finally call his family to inform them of what's going on. Bob's family comes west for the first time to visit. Bob makes peace with his family at last. Bob's childhood wish is finally granted by a circus in the backyard.

As his father shaves him, Bob shows that he has at last made peace by telling his father he loves him. Bob finally comes to terms with his life as he dies peacefully, surrounded by the loving, supportive bosom of his family. Next is shown Bob on a metaphysical roller coaster, this time letting go of the railing, raising his arms freely in the air this time, metaphorically letting go of life, and finally enjoying the ride of life. Bob rides toward a beautiful, shining, ethereal light (presumably [[heaven]]). A year later, his son and wife watch him on video, as she reads [[Dr. Seuss]]'s ''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]'' to him.

The '''Oldenburgisches Staatstheater''' (Oldenburg State Theatre) is a [[Germany|German]] [[theater]] in the city of [[Oldenburg]], [[Lower Saxony]].

==Beginnings==
The theatre was first opened in the times of the [[Duchy of Oldenburg|Grand Duchy of Oldenburg]], on 1 February 1833.  At that time it was a wooden structure built by local master carpenter Herman Wilhelm Muck, who also owned the building. Founder and first director of the theatre was Carl Christian Ludwig Starklof (1789–1850), a lawyer and writer who served as a [[privy councilor]] in Oldenburg. Also involved was actor Johann Christian Gerber (1785–1850) who had previously directed a theatre in the neighbouring city of Bremen.&lt;ref&gt;Kürschner, Joseph: [http://de.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=ADB:Gerber,_Johann_Christian&amp;oldid=1705991 Gerber, Johann Christian.] In: ''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie'',  Historische Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (ed.), vol. 8 (1878), p. 722. Digital full text: Wikisource (accessed 27 Jan 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The founding was supported by [[Princess Cecilia of Sweden (1807–1844)|Grand Duchess Cecilia]] (1807–1844). The theatre was named ''Großherzogliches Hoftheater'' (Grand Ducal Court Theatre) in 1842.

The wooden building was given up in 1881 when the theatre moved into the more  imposing new Renaissance-style stone building designed by court architect Gerhard Schnitger.{{fact|date=August 2015}} It was built next to the old structure.

Only ten years later, in November 1891, the new building burnt to the ground after a fire accident.{{fact|date=August 2015}} The theatre company continued to work in a temporary wood building nearby while the destroyed venue was rebuilt under the supervision of Oldenburg court architect Franz Noack and Paul Moritz Zimmer, an architect from [[Chemnitz]]. The reconstruction adhered to Gerhard Schnitger’s original design, but modifications were made to replace gas lighting with electrical lighting. A large dome roof was added in order to accommodate a water tank above the stage area – an important fire protection measure at the time. Workshop space was expanded. The interior walls and ceilings were lavishly decorated with baroque-style mouldings, wall sculptures, frescoes. The new electrical lighting was integrated into the decoration. The theatre then reopened in October 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Henneberg, Jörg Michael / Kreier, Peter: Musentempel des Historismus im neuen Glanze – Zur Baugeschichte des Oldenburgischen Staatstheaters.

==History==
By the early 1800s, live performance was increasing in popularity in Australia, although no entertainment venues existed to house performances. In the 1830s, both [[Sydney]] and [[Hobart]] received two theatres, the first in the Australian colonies.&lt;ref name="Illustrated" /&gt; 

Only four years following settlement of South Australia in 1836, attempts to build a substantial theatre in an increasingly prosperous Adelaide were made, with a declaration by the ''South Australian Register'' stating "...Mr Solomon, of Currie Street, is about to make an important addition to the quarter of Gilles Arcade, by the erection of a spacious and handsome edifice which he ends to fit up as a theatre".&lt;ref name="Illustrated" /&gt;  It was built for [[Emanuel Solomon]] (1800–1873) and his Sydney-based brother [[Vaiben Solomon]] (1802–1860)&lt;ref&gt;Two of Vaiben's brothers lived in Adelaide: Emanuel and Isaac.

Public appetite for entertainment had waned with the Depression brought on by [[Governor Grey]]'s fiscally responsible regime following the prosperity of [[Governor Gawler]]'s rule, when huge sums were invested in public infrastructure. 
After months of losing money, Lazar dismissed his company and converted the seating to something more appropriate to public meetings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71615222 |title=Theatricals in Adelaide |newspaper=[[Southern Australian]] |volume=IV, |issue=237 |location=South Australia |date=27 August 1841 |accessdate=18 June 2017 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some use was made of the theatre for public meetings and lectures, but did not renew his lease.
 
Solomon offered the government use of the theatre ''gratis'' if they would prohibit the building of further taverns in the vicinity (his Shakspere Tavern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50246683 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=7 February 1849 |accessdate=10 August 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently named Temple Tavern, was adjacent). This was rejected, but in 1843 the government signed a contract with Solomon for three years' rental at £200 per annum for use as Resident Magistrates Court, Supreme Court and offices for the Registrar General, the Advocate General, the Assistant Crown Solicitor and Assistant to the Bench of Magistrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37115150 |title=South Australia |newspaper=[[The Australian (1824 newspaper)|The Australian]] |location=Sydney |date=24 July 1843 |accessdate=8 August 2012 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1846 and 1847 Solomon, whose nephew [[Judah Moss Solomon]] (1818–1880) was an occasional partner, attempted to sell the theatre and tavern by lottery, but it was never fully subscribed so he refunded to the punters their stakes.

It reopened, re-using the name '''Royal Victoria Theatre''', under the management of [[John Lazar]] and [[George Coppin]], on 23 December 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38437326 |title=The Theatre |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=24 December 1850 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861 it closed for refurbishment and substantial remodelling, and reopened in July with A. J. Solomon the new lessee and Robert MacGowan the stage manager&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50084507 |title=Victoria Theatre |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=15 July 1861 |accessdate=30 August 2012 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; of what was Adelaide's only theatre until the opening of the Theatre Royal at 28 [[Hindley Street, Adelaide|Hindley Street]] on 13 April 1868,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55153409 |title=Old-Time Theatres |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=6 January 1921 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; which spelled the demise of the "Victoria".

===Recent development===

The building was purchased by the South Australian Asset Management Corporation and transferred to Heritage SA in the 1980s. Excavation revealed historically significant remains and numerous artefacts.

The Queen's Theatre was reopened as a performance venue at the 1996 Adelaide Festival of Arts, with a performance of [[The Magic Flute]] by [[Opera Australia]]. Following essential refurbishments, it was reopened  for the launch of the 1998 Festival of Arts by [[Robyn Archer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liveguide.com.au/Venues/6518/Queens_Theatre Queens Theatre in Adelaide, SA]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Theodor Kittelsen, Soria Moria.jpg|right|thumb|"[[Soria Moria Castle|Soria Moria]]" by [[Theodor Kittelsen]]:  a hero glimpses the end of his quest.]]
{{Fantasy}}
{{Speculative fiction|cTopic=Fantasy fiction}}

A '''quest''' is a journey toward a specific mission or a goal. The word serves as a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] device in [[mythology]] and [[fiction]]: a difficult [[Travel|journey]] towards a goal, often [[symbol]]ic or [[Allegory|allegorical]].  Tales of quests figure prominently in the [[folklore]] of every nation&lt;ref&gt;Josepha Sherman, ''Once upon a Galaxy'' p 142 {{ISBN|0-87483-387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic culture]].  In [[literature]], the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the [[hero]], who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel.  The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character).&lt;ref&gt;Michael O. Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, p 178-9, {{ISBN|0-7006-0832-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object of a quest may also have [[supernatural]] properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. The [[moral]] of a quest tale often centers on the changed [[Moral character|character]] of the hero.

==Quest objects==

[[Image:TheKnightAtTheCrossroads.jpg|left|thumb|''A Knight at the Crossroads'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]

The hero normally aims to obtain something or someone by the quest, and with this object to return home.&lt;ref&gt;
[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings: The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p35 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object can be something new, that fulfills a lack in his life, or something that was stolen away from him or someone with authority to dispatch him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale, p 36, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the hero has no desire to return; Sir [[Galahad]]'s quest for the [[Holy Grail]] is to find it, not return with it. A return may, indeed, be impossible: [[Aeneas]] quests for a homeland, having lost Troy at the beginning of [[Virgil]]'s ''Aeneid,'' and he does not return to Troy to re-found it but settles in Italy (to become an ancestor of the Romans).

If the hero does return after the culmination of the quest, he may face [[false hero]]es who attempt to pass themselves off as him,&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p60, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or his initial response may be a rejection of that return, as [[Joseph Campbell]] describes in his critical analysis of quest literature, ''[[The Hero With a Thousand Faces]]''.

If someone dispatches the hero on a quest, the overt reason may be false, with the dispatcher actually sending him on the difficult quest in hopes of his death in the attempt, or in order to remove him from the scene for a time, just as if the claim were sincere, except that the tale usually ends with the dispatcher being unmasked and punished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p77 {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories with such false quest-objects include the legends of [[Jason]] and [[Perseus]], the fairy tales ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', ''[[Go I Know Not Whither and Fetch I Know Not What]]'', and the story of [[Beren and Lúthien]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]''.

The quest object may, indeed, function only as a convenient reason for the hero's journey. Such objects are termed [[MacGuffin]]s. When a hero is on a quest for several objects that are only a convenient reason for his journey, they are termed plot coupons.

==Literary analysis==
The quest, in the form of the [[Monomyth#The Hero's Journey|Hero's Journey]], plays a central role in the [[Monomyth]] described by [[Joseph Campbell]]; the hero sets forth from the world of common day into a land of adventures, tests, and magical rewards.  Most times in a quest, the knight in shining armor wins the heart of a beautiful maiden/ princess.

==Historical examples==
An early quest story tells the tale of [[Gilgamesh]], who seeks a secret to eternal life after the death of [[Enkidu]], including the search for an [[emerald]].

Another ancient quest tale, [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', tells of [[Odysseus]], whom the gods have cursed to wander and suffer for many years before [[Athena]] persuades the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]] to allow him to return home.  Recovering the [[Golden Fleece]] is the object of the travels of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in the ''[[Argonautica]]''. [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], having lost Cupid, hunted through the world for him, and was set tasks by [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], including a descent into the [[underworld]].

Many [[fairy tale]]s depict the hero or heroine setting out on a quest, such as:

* ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'' where the heroine seeks her husband
* ''[[The Seven Ravens]]'' where the heroine seeks her transformed brothers
* ''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]''
* ''[[The Golden Bird]]'' where the prince sets out to find the golden bird for his father

Other characters may set out with no more definite aim than to "seek their fortune", or even be cast out instead of voluntarily leaving, but learn of something that could aid them along the way and so have their journey transformed from aimless wandering into a quest.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p63, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other characters can also set forth on quests — the hero's older brothers commonly do — but the hero is distinguished by his success.

[[Image:Galahad grail.jpg|left|360px|thumb|"Vision of the Holy Grail" (1890) by [[William Morris]]]]

Many medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] sent knights out on quests. The term "[[Knight-errant]]" sprang from this, as ''errant'' meant "roving" or "wandering".  Sir [[Thomas Malory]] included many in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.  The most famous—perhaps in all of western literature—centers on the [[Holy Grail]] in [[Arthurian legend]].  This [[monomyth|story cycle]] recounts multiple quests, in multiple variants, telling stories both of the heroes who succeed, like [[Percival]] (in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s [[Parzival]]) or Sir [[Galahad]] (in the [[Queste del Saint Graal]]), and also the heroes who fail, like Sir [[Lancelot]].  This often sent them into a bewildering [[enchanted forest|forest]].  Despite many references to its pathlessness, the forest repeatedly confronts knights with forks and crossroads, of a labyrinthine complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 177, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of their encounters is often explained to the knights—particularly those searching for the [[Holy Grail]]—by [[hermit]]s acting as [[wise old man|wise old men -- or women]].&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 179-81, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Still, despite their perils and chances of error, such forests, being the location where the knight can obtain the end of his quest, are places where the knights may become worthy; one romance has a maiden urging Sir Lancelot on his quest for the Holy Grail, "which quickens with life and greenness like the forest."&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 181, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So consistently did knights quest that [[Miguel de Cervantes]] set his [[Don Quixote]] on mock quests in a parody of chivalric tales. Nevertheless, while Don Quixote was a fool, he was and remains a hero of chivalry.

==Modern literature==
Quests continued in modern literature.  Analysis can interpret many (perhaps most) stories as a quest in which the main character is seeking something that he desires,&lt;ref&gt;Robert McKee, ''Story:  Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting'', p 196-7 {{ISBN|0-06-039168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the literal structure of a journey seeking something is, itself, still common.  Quests often appear in [[fantasy]] literature,&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Quest ", p 796 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Rasselas]] by [[Samuel Johnson]], or ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', where Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion go on a quest for the way back to Kansas, brains, a heart, and courage respectively.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 126-7, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quests, also, play a major role in [[Rick Riordan]]'s fantasy books, among them ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'', ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'', and ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]''.

A familiar modern literary quest is [[Frodo Baggins]]'s quest to destroy the [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings:  The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p45 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The One Ring, its baleful power, the difficult method which is the only way to destroy it, and the spiritual and psychological torture it wreaks on its Bearer; [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] uses all these elements to tell a meaningful tale of [[friendship]] and the inner struggle with [[temptation]], against a background of [[epic poetry|epic]] and supernatural warfare.

''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is often thought of as a quest plot, detailing Holden's search not for a tangible object but for a sense of purpose or reason.

Some writers, however, may devise arbitrary quests for items without any importance beyond being the object of the quest.  These items are known as [[MacGuffin]]s, which is sometimes merely used to compare quests and is not always a derogatory term.  Writers may also motivate characters to pursue these objects by meanings of a [[Self-fulfilling prophecy#Literature, media, and the arts|prophecy]] that decrees it, rather than have them discover that it could assist them, for reasons that are given.

[[File:Red herring.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Herrings [[kipper]]ed by smoking and salting until they turn reddish-brown, i.e., a "red herring". Prior to refrigeration kipper was known for being strongly [[pungency|pungent]]. In 1807, William Cobbett wrote how he used [[kipper]] (a strong-smelling smoked fish) to lay a false trail, while training [[hunting dog]]s—an [[apocrypha]]l story that was probably the origin of the idiom.]]

A '''red herring''' is something that misleads or distracts from a relevant or important issue.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. red herring, n. Third edition, September 2009; online version December 2011. http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/160314; accessed 18 December 2011. An entry for this word was first included in New English Dictionary, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be either a logical [[fallacy]] or a [[literary device]] that leads readers or audiences towards a false conclusion. A red herring might be intentionally used, such as in mystery fiction or as part of [[rhetorical strategies]] (e.g., in politics), or it could be inadvertently used during argumentation.

The term was popularized in 1807 by English polemicist [[William Cobbett]], who told a story of having used a [[kipper]] (a strong-smelling smoked fish) to divert hounds from chasing a hare.

== Logical fallacy ==

As an [[informal fallacy]], the red herring falls into a broad class of [[relevance]] fallacies. Unlike the [[straw man]], which is premised on a distortion of the other party's position,&lt;ref name="Hurley2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hurley, Patrick J.|title=A Concise Introduction to Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ikp2dGWT5O4C&amp;pg=PT155|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-8400-3417-5|pages=131–133|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222174516/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ikp2dGWT5O4C&amp;pg=PT155|archivedate=2017-02-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the red herring is a seemingly plausible, though ultimately irrelevant, diversionary tactic.&lt;ref name="Tindale2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tindale, Christopher W.|title=Fallacies and Argument Appraisal|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84208-2|pages=28–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', a red herring may be intentional, or unintentional; it is not necessarily a conscious intent to mislead.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

The expression is mainly used to assert that an argument is not relevant to the issue being discussed. For example, ''"I think we should make the academic requirements stricter for students. I recommend you support this because we are in a budget crisis, and we do not want our salaries affected."'' The second sentence, though used to support the first sentence, does not address that topic.

== Intentional device ==

A red herring is often used in legal studies and exam problems to mislead and distract students from reaching a correct conclusion about a legal issue, allegedly as a device that tests students' comprehension of underlying law and their ability to properly discern material factual circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheppard|first=Steve (ed.)|title=The history of legal education in the United States : commentaries and primary sources|date=2005|publisher=Lawbook Exchange|location=Clark, N.J.|isbn=1584776900|edition=2nd print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the idiom ==

{{quote box|author=-[[William Cobbett]], February 14, 1807|title=Continental War|source=''Cobbett's Political Register, Volume XI''&lt;ref name=cobbett/&gt;|quote="When I was a boy, we used, in order to draw oft' the [[Harrier (dog)|harriers]] from the trail of a [[hare]] that we had set down as our own private property, get to her haunt&lt;ref&gt;''haunt'' – Wiktionary defines [[wikt:haunt|haunt]] as a "place at which one is regularly found; a hangout", but it can also mean a "feeding place for animals", both senses would work here.&lt;/ref&gt; early in the morning, and drag a red-herring, tied to a string, four or five miles over hedges and ditches, across fields and through [[coppices]], till we got to a point, whence we were pretty sure the hunters would not return to the spot where they had thrown off; and, though I would, by no means, be understood, as comparing the editors and proprietors of the London daily press to animals half so sagacious and so faithful as hounds, I cannot help thinking, that, in the case to which we are referring, they must have been misled, at first, by some political deceiver."|width=30%|border=4px|align=right}}

In a literal sense, there is no such fish as a "red herring"; it refers to a particularly strong [[kipper]], a fish (typically a [[herring]]) that has been strongly [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] in [[brine]] and/or heavily [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]]. This process makes the fish particularly pungent smelling and, with strong enough brine, turns its flesh reddish.&lt;ref name=quinion2002&gt;{{cite web | author=Quinion, Michael | year=2002–2008 | title=The Lure of the Red Herring | work=[[World Wide Words]] | url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/herring.htm | accessdate=November 10, 2010 | authorlink=Michael Quinion | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104180714/http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/herring.htm | archivedate=November 4, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its literal sense as a strongly cured kipper, the term can be dated to the mid-13th century, in the poem ''[[The Treatise (Walter of Bibbesworth)|The Treatise]]'' by [[Walter of Bibbesworth]]: "He eteþ no ffyssh But heryng red."&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter de Bibbesworth|Bibbesworth, Walter de]] (c. 1250) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=hmocAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Femina&amp;dq=Femina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KcecUKrvNpGImQW0zIDoCw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCg ''Femina''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230213316/https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=hmocAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Femina&amp;dq=Femina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KcecUKrvNpGImQW0zIDoCw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCg |date=2017-12-30 }} Trinity College, Cambridge MS B.14.40. 27.

Prior to 2008,&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; the [[figurative sense]] of "red herring" was thought to originate from a supposed technique of training young [[scent hound]]s.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; There are variations of the story, but according to one version, the pungent red herring would be dragged along a trail until a puppy learned to follow the scent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Nashe|Nashe, Thomas]]. (1599) [http://www.oxford-shakespeare.com/Nashe/Nashes_Lenten_Stuff.pdf ''Nashes Lenten Stuffe''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715030947/http://www.oxford-shakespeare.com/Nashe/Nashes_Lenten_Stuff.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }} "Next, to draw on hounds to a sent, to a redde herring skinne there is nothing comparable." (Since Nashe makes this statement not in a serious reference to hunting but as an aside in a humorous pamphlet, the professed aim of which is to extol the wonderful virtues of red herrings, it need not be evidence of actual practice. In the same paragraph he makes other unlikely claims, such as that the fish dried and powdered is a prophylactic for kidney or gallstones.)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when the dog was being trained to follow the faint odour of a [[Fox hunting|fox]] or a [[badger]], the trainer would drag a red herring (whose strong scent confuses the animal) perpendicular to the animal's trail to confuse the dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jal.2008.09.004 |first=J.E.P |last=Currall  |year=2008 |title=Authenticity: a red herring? |journal=Journal of Applied Logic |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=534–544 |issn=1570-8683|last2=Moss |first2=M.S. |last3=Stuart |first3=S.A.J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dog eventually learned to follow the original scent rather than the stronger scent. A variation of this story is given, without mention of its use in training, in ''The Macmillan Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' (1976), with the earliest use cited being from W. F. Butler's ''Life of Napier'', published in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;[[Burton Stevenson|Stevenson, Burton]] (ed.) (1976) [1948] ''The Macmillan Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' New York: Macmillan. p.1139. {{ISBN|0-02-614500-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'' (1981) gives the full phrase as "Drawing a red herring across the path", an idiom meaning "to divert attention from the main question by some side issue"; here, once again, a "dried, smoked and salted" herring when "drawn across a fox's path destroys the scent and sets the hounds at fault."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Ivor H. (ed.) (1981) ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]] (Centenary edition, revised) New York: Harper &amp; Row. p.549. {{ISBN|0-06-014903-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation of the dog story is given by Robert Hendrickson (1994) who says escaping convicts used the pungent fish to throw off hounds in pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, Robert (2000). ''The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins''. United States: Checkmark.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a pair of articles by Professor Gerald Cohen and Robert Scott Ross published in ''Comments on Etymology'' (2008), supported by etymologist [[Michael Quinion]] and accepted by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the idiom did not originate from a hunting practice.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; Ross researched the origin of the story and found the earliest reference to using herrings for training animals was in a tract on horsemanship published in 1697 by Gerland Langbaine.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; Langbaine recommended a method of training horses (not hounds) by dragging the carcass of a cat or fox so that the horse would be accustomed to following the chaos of a hunting party.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; He says if a dead animal is not available, a red herring would do as a substitute.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; This recommendation was misunderstood by Nicholas Cox, published in the notes of another book around the same time, who said it should be used to train hounds (not horses).&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; Either way, the herring was not used to distract the hounds or horses from a trail, rather to guide them along it.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt;

The earliest reference to using herring for distracting hounds is an article published on 14 February 1807 by radical journalist [[William Cobbett]] in his polemical periodical ''[[Political Register]]''.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Red herring", [[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Sense 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cobbett&gt;"...we used, in order to draw oft' the harriers from the trail of a hare that we had set down as our own private property, get to her haunt early in the morning, and drag a red-herring, tied to a string, four or five miles over hedges and ditches..." For the full original story by Cobbett, see [https://archive.org/stream/cobbettspolitica11cobb#page/116/mode/2up "Continental War"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629152657/http://www.archive.org/stream/cobbettspolitica11cobb |date=2016-06-29 }} on pg. 231-33 of ''Political Register'', February 14, 1807. In [https://archive.org/details/cobbettspolitica11cobb ''Cobbett's political register, Volume XI, 1807''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803231251/https://archive.org/details/cobbettspolitica11cobb |date=2016-08-03 }} at [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cohen and Ross, and accepted by the OED, this is the origin of the figurative meaning of red herring.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; In the piece, William Cobbett critiques the English press, which had mistakenly reported Napoleon's defeat. Cobbett recounted that he had once used a red herring to deflect hounds in pursuit of a hare, adding "It was a mere transitory effect of the political red-herring; for, on the Saturday, the scent became as cold as a stone."&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; Quinion concludes: "This story, and [Cobbett's] extended repetition of it in 1833, was enough to get the figurative sense of ''red herring'' into the minds of his readers, unfortunately also with the false idea that it came from some real practice of huntsmen."&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt;

=== Real-world usage ===

Although Cobbett popularized the figurative usage, he was not the first to consider red herring for scenting hounds in a literal sense; an earlier reference occurs in the pamphlet ''Nashe's Lenten Stuffe'', published in 1599 by the Elizabethan writer [[Thomas Nashe]], in which he says "Next, to draw on hounds to a scent, to a red herring skin there is nothing comparable."&lt;ref name=Nashe&gt;[[Thomas Nashe|Nashe, Thomas]] (1599) [http://www.oxford-shakespeare.com/Nashe/Nashes_Lenten_Stuff.pdf ''Praise of the Red Herring''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715030947/http://www.oxford-shakespeare.com/Nashe/Nashes_Lenten_Stuff.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }} In: William Oldys and John Malham (Eds) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=JxOjdlsWMGcC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;lpg=PA331&amp;dq=%22on+hounds+to+a+scent%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LZlI9hToJr&amp;sig=aqRgPgjXnFakagAqVgvlw9YpOtY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3JUuT4rlGOa5iQfnoNjdDg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22on%20hounds%20to%20a%20scent%22&amp;f=false  ''The Harleian miscellany''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230213316/https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=JxOjdlsWMGcC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;lpg=PA331&amp;dq=%22on+hounds+to+a+scent%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LZlI9hToJr&amp;sig=aqRgPgjXnFakagAqVgvlw9YpOtY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3JUuT4rlGOa5iQfnoNjdDg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA |date=2017-12-30 }} Volume 2, Printed for R. Dutton, 1809. Page 331.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' makes no connection with Nashe's quote and the figurative meaning of red herring to distract from the intended target, only in the literal sense of a hunting practice to draw dogs towards a scent.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

The use of herring to distract pursuing scent hounds was tested on [[MythBusters (2010 season)#Episode 148 – Hair of the Dog|Episode 148]] of the series ''[[MythBusters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1683693|MythBusters: Season 9, Episode 1 - Hair of the Dog}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the hound used in the test stopped to eat the fish and lost the fugitive's scent temporarily, it eventually backtracked and located the target, resulting in the myth being classified by the show as "Busted".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythbustersresults.com/hair-of-the-dog Episode 148: Hair of the Dog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105122838/http://mythbustersresults.com/hair-of-the-dog |date=2012-11-05 }}, Mythbustersresults.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sailors Valentine.jpg|thumb|A sailor's valentine in the collection of the [[Mariners Museum]].]]

A '''sailor's valentine''' is a form of [[shellcraft]], a type of mostly [[antique]] [[souvenir]], or sentimental gift made using large numbers of small [[seashell]]s. These were originally made between 1830 and 1890, and they were designed to be brought home from a sailor's voyage at sea and given to the sailor's loved one or loved ones.&lt;ref name=fondas&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fondas |first1=John |title=Sailors' Valentines |year=2002 |publisher=Rizzoli |location=New York |isbn=9780847824144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sailor valentines are typically [[octagonal]], glass fronted, hinged wooden boxes ranging from {{convert|8|to|20|in|cm}} in width, displaying intricate symmetrical designs composed entirely of small [[sea shell]]s of various colors glued onto a backing. Patterns often feature a centerpiece such as a [[compass rose]] or a heart design, hence the name, and in some cases the small shells are used to spell out a motto or sentimental message.&lt;ref name="Folk Art Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Wertkin |editor-first=Gerard C. |last=Frank |first=Stuart M. |title=Sailors' Valentines |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of American Folk Art |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, NY |page=447 |isbn=9780415929868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the name seems to suggest that the sailors themselves made these objects, a large number of them originated in the island of [[Barbados]], which was an important seaport during this period. Historians believe that the women on Barbados made the valentines using local shells, or in some cases using shells imported from [[Indonesia]], and then the finished products were sold to the sailors.&lt;ref name=fondas/&gt;

In his book ''Sailors' Valentines'', John Fondas concludes that the primary source for sailor's valentines was the New Curiosity Shop, located in McGregor Street, [[Bridgetown]], Barbados, a popular shop where sailors would purchase souvenirs. The shop was owned by the English brothers B.H. and George Belgrave.&lt;ref&gt;See also Norma Faria, [http://www.caribbeancompass.com/scrimshaw.htm "Scrimshaw Art in Bequia"], ''Caribbean Compass'', March 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Fondas recounts that while an antique sailor's valentine was being repaired and reconstructed, pieces of a Barbados newspaper were found inside the backing material.&lt;ref name=fondas/&gt;

Today, antique sailor's valentines are collectibles, valued for their beauty and unusual qualities. Collector interest has sparked a resurgence in sailor's valentines as an art form, and because of this, shell kits and patterns are now sold at craft shops.&lt;ref name="Madeira et al"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Madeira |first1=Grace L. |last2=Miller |first2=Marshall |last3=Page |first3=Mary S. |last4=Schutt |first4=Ann T. |title=Sailors' Valentines: Their Journey Through Time |year=2006 |publisher=Schiffer Publishing |location=Atglen, PA |isbn=9780764323782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sailor's valentines, both new and old, can be found on [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]].

'''Site-specific art''' is [[work of art|artwork]] created to exist in a certain place. Typically, the artist takes the location into account while planning and creating the artwork. Site-specific art is produced both by commercial artists, and independently, and can include some instances of work such as [[sculpture]], [[stencil graffiti]], [[rock balancing]], and other art forms. Installations can be in urban areas, remote natural settings, or underwater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lataco.com/interview-rafael-schacter-author-amazing-new-book-world-atlas-street-art-graffiti/ http://www.lataco.com] Interview with Rafael Schacter, Author of ''The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/books/review/city-as-canvas-and-the-world-atlas-of-street-art-and-graffiti.html https://www.nytimes.com] Aerosol Art.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filippominelli.com/project/silence-shapes/ http://www.filippominelli.com] Filippo Minelli "''Silence/Shapes''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Schacter, author of "''The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti''", September, 2013; {{ISBN|9780300199420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynstreetart.com/theblog/2014/02/13/rafael-schacter-and-his-world-atlas-of-street-art-and-graffiti/ http://www.brooklynstreetart.com] Rafael Schacter and His "World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bANKhbe1Vg8 https://www.youtube] Gravity Glue 2015; (Underwater [[Rock balancing|Rock balance]] at 3:55).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "site-specific art" was promoted and refined by Californian artist [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The art of light + space|last=Butterfield|first=Jan|publisher=Abbeville|year=1993|isbn=1558592725|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robert Irwin: All the Rules Will Change|last=Hankins|first=Evelyn|publisher=Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden|year=2016|isbn=3791355147|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was actually first used in the mid-1970s by young sculptors, such as [[Patricia Johanson]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], and [[Athena Tacha]], who had started executing public commissions for large urban sites.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} For ''Two Jumps for Dead Dog Creek'' (1970), Oppenheim attempted a series of standing jumps at a selected site in Idaho, where "the width of the creek became a specific goal to which I geared a bodily activity," with his two successful jumps being "dictated by a land form."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Site-Specific Art: Performance, Place and Documentation|chapter=Embodying Site: Dennis Oppenheim and Vito Acconci|last=Kaye|first=Nick|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0-203-13829-5|location=New York|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Site specific environmental art was first described as a movement by architectural critic Catherine Howett and art critic [[Lucy Lippard]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Emerging out of [[minimalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Place After Another: Site-Specific Art and Locational Identity|chapter=|last=Kwon|first=Miwon|publisher=MIT|year=2002|isbn=0-203-13829-5|location=Cambridge (Massachusetts), London|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; site-specific art opposed the [[Modernism|Modernist]] program of subtracting from the artwork all cues that interfere with the fact that it is "art",&lt;ref&gt;Kaye (citing O'Docherty's ''Inside the White Cube'', 1986), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernist art objects were transportable,  nomadic, could only exist in the museum space and were the objects of the market and commodification. Since 1960 the artists were trying to find a way out of this situation, and thus drew attention to the site and the context around this site. The work of art was created in the site and could only exist and in such circumstances - it can not be moved or changed. '''Site''' is a current location, which comprises a unique combination of physical elements: depth, length, weight, height, shape, walls, temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Works of art began to emerge from the walls of the museum and galleries ([[Daniel Buren]], Within and Beyond the Frame, John Weber Gallery, New York, 1973), were created specifically for the museum and galleries ([[Michael Asher (artist)|Michael Asher]], untitled installation at Claire Copley Gallery, Los Angeles, 1974, [[Hans Haacke]], Condensation Cube, 1963–65, [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], Hartford Wash: Washing Tracks, Maintenance Outside, Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, 1973), thus criticizing the museum as an institution that sets the rules for artists and viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Max Albert]], created [[Sculptures Bachelard]] in [[Parc de la Villette]] related to the site, or ''Carlotta’s Smile'', a [[trellis (architecture)|trellis]] construction related to Ar. Co,’s architecture [[Lisbon]], and to a choreography in collaboration with Michala Marcus and [[Carlos Zingaro]], 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arcoabecedario.pt/entries/41?locale=en|title=Abecedário — AR.CO — Centro de Arte e Comunicação Visual|website=www.arcoabecedario.pt|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the public debate over ''[[Tilted Arc]]'' (1981) resulted in its removal in 1989, its author [[Richard Serra]] reacted with what can be considered a definition of site-specific art: "To move the work is to destroy the work."&lt;ref&gt;Kaye, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carlotta's Smile.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Max Albert]], ''Carlotta's Smile'', a trellis construction with a choreography, in collaboration with Michala Marcus and [[Carlos Zingaro]], Lisbon, 1979]]

==Examples==
Outdoor site-specific artworks often include [[landscaping]] combined with permanently sited [[sculpture|sculptural]] elements; it is sometimes linked with [[environmental art]]. Outdoor site-specific artworks can also include [[dance]] [[performance]]s created especially for the site. More broadly, the term is sometimes used for any work that is more or less permanently attached to a particular location. In this sense, a building with interesting [[Architecture (built environment)|architecture]] could also be considered a piece of site-specific art.

In Geneva, Switzerland, two Contemporary Art Funds of the city have been looking to integrate art into the architecture and the public space since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://institutions.ville-geneve.ch/fr/fmac/fmac/missions/|title=Missions {{!}} Fonds d'art contemporain {{!}} Ville de Genève : Sites des institutions|website=institutions.ville-geneve.ch|language=fr|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Neons Parallax project initiated in 2007 was conceived specifically for the Plaine de Plainpalais, located in the heart of the city. The challenge of the artists invited was to transpose commercial advertising signs of the harbour into artistic messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neons.ch Neons Parallax]&lt;/ref&gt; The project has received the Swiss [https://www.juliusbaer.com/global/en/news-insights/news-insights-detail-page/item/the-prix-visarte-2017-an-award-for-public-art/ Prix Visarte 2017].

Site-specific performance art, site-specific visual art and interventions are commissioned for the annual [[Infecting the City]] Festival in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. The site-specific nature of the work allows artists to interrogate the contemporary and historic reality of the Central Business District and create work that allows the city's users to engage and interact with public spaces in new and memorable ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africacentre.net/infecting-the-city/|title=Infecting The City - Africa Centre|date=2014-03-28|work=Africa Centre|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Strawberry shortcake.jpg|right|thumb|Sweet foods, such as this strawberry [[shortcake]], are often eaten for [[dessert]].]]

'''Sweetness''' is a [[basic taste]] most commonly [[Perception|perceived]] when [[eating]] [[food]]s rich in [[sugar]]s. Sweet tastes are regarded as a [[pleasure|pleasurable]] experience, except perhaps in excess.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In addition to sugars like [[sucrose]], many other [[chemical compound]]s are sweet, including [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s, and [[sugar alcohol]]s. Some are sweet at very low concentrations, allowing their use as non-caloric [[sugar substitute]]s. Such [[Sugar substitute|non-sugar sweeteners]] include [[saccharin]] and [[aspartame]]. Other compounds, such as [[miraculin]], may alter perception of sweetness itself.

The [[chemoreceptor|chemosensory]] basis for detecting sweetness, which varies between both individuals and species, has only begun to be understood since the late 20th century. One theoretical model of sweetness is the [[#MPA theory of sweetness|multipoint attachment theory]], which involves multiple binding sites between a sweetness receptor and a sweet substance.

Studies indicate that responsiveness to sugars and sweetness has very ancient evolutionary beginnings, being manifest as [[chemotaxis]] even in [[Motility|motile]] bacteria such as ''E. coli''.&lt;ref&gt;Blass, E.M. ''Opioids, sweets and a mechanism for positive affect: Broad motivational implications.'' {{harv|Dobbing|1987|pp=115–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newborn human infants also demonstrate preferences for high sugar concentrations and prefer solutions that are sweeter than [[lactose]], the sugar found in breast milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0034906 | last1 = Desor | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Maller | first2 = O. | last3 = Turner | first3 = R.E. | year = 1973 | title = Taste acceptance of sugars by human infants | journal = Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology | volume = 84 | issue = 3| pages = 496–501 | pmid = 4745817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2 June 1983 |last=Schiffman |first=Susan S.|last2=Schiffman|first2=Susan S. |title=Taste and smell in disease (Second of two parts) |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=308 |issue=22 |pages=1337–43 |pmid=6341845 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198306023082207 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweetness appears to have the highest taste recognition threshold, being detectable at around 1 part in 200 of sucrose in solution. By comparison, [[Taste#Bitterness|bitterness]] appears to have the lowest detection threshold, at about 1 part in 2 million for quinine in solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=McAleer, N. |title=The Body Almanac: Mind-boggling facts about today's human body and high-tech medicine |publisher=Doubleday  |location=New York |year=1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the natural settings that human primate ancestors evolved in, sweetness intensity should indicate [[energy density]], while bitterness tends to indicate [[toxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altman | first1 = S. | year = 1989 | title = The monkey and the fig: A Socratic dialogue on evolutionary themes | journal = American Scientist | volume = 77 | pages = 256–263 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Johns, T. |title=With Bitter Herbs They Shall Eat It: Chemical ecology and the origins of human diet and medicine |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Tucson |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Logue, A.W. |title=The Psychology of Eating and Drinking  |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=New York |year=1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high sweetness detection threshold and low bitterness detection threshold would have predisposed our primate ancestors to seek out sweet-tasting (and energy-dense) foods and avoid bitter-tasting foods. Even amongst leaf-eating primates, there is a tendency to prefer immature leaves, which tend to be higher in protein and lower in fibre and poisons than mature leaves.&lt;ref name=" encylopediahumanevolution"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jones, S. |author2=Martin, R. |author3=Pilbeam, D. |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Evolution |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'sweet tooth' thus has an ancient evolutionary heritage, and while food processing has changed consumption patterns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/053901848001900603 | last1 = Fischler | first1 = C. | year = 1980 | title = Food habits, social change and the nature/culture dilemma | journal = Social Science Information | volume = 19 | pages = 937–953 | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fischler, C.

==Examples of sweet substances==
{{further|Sugar substitute}}

A great diversity of [[chemical compound]]s, such as [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s are sweet. Among common biological substances, all of the simple [[carbohydrate]]s are sweet to at least some degree. [[Sucrose]] (table sugar) is the prototypical example of a sweet substance. Sucrose in solution has a sweetness perception rating of 1, and other substances are rated relative to this.&lt;ref name=Guyton91&gt;{{cite book |author=Guyton, Arthur C. |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1991 |edition=8th }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, another sugar, [[fructose]], is somewhat sweeter, being rated at 1.7 times the sweetness of sucrose.&lt;ref name=Guyton91/&gt;  Some of the [[amino acid]]s are mildly sweet: [[alanine]], [[glycine]], and [[serine]] are the sweetest. Some other amino acids are perceived as both sweet and bitter.

A number of plant species produce [[glycosides]] that are sweet at concentrations much lower than [[sugar]].  The most well-known example is [[glycyrrhizin]], the sweet component of [[licorice]] root, which is about 30 times sweeter than sucrose.  Another commercially important example is [[stevioside]], from the [[South America]]n shrub ''[[Stevia]] rebaudiana''.  It is roughly 250 times sweeter than sucrose. Another class of potent natural sweeteners are the sweet proteins such as [[thaumatin]], found in the [[West Africa]]n [[katemfe]] fruit.  Hen egg [[lysozyme]], an [[antibiotic]] protein found in [[chicken egg]]s, is also sweet.

The latter may have contributed to [[lead poisoning]] among the [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] aristocracy: the Roman delicacy ''sapa'' was prepared by boiling soured [[wine]] (containing [[acetic acid]]) in lead pots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Couper RTL. |title=The Severe Gout of Emperor Charles V |journal=N Engl J Med |year=2006 |volume=355 |issue=18 |pages=1935–36 |doi=10.1056/NEJMc062352 |pmid=17079773 |last2=Fernandez |first2=P.

Hundreds of synthetic organic compounds are known to be sweet. The number of these that are legally permitted as food additives is, however, much smaller. For example, [[chloroform]], [[nitrobenzene]], and [[Ethylene glycol]] are sweet, but also toxic. {{As of|2005}}, seven artificial sweeteners are in widespread use: [[saccharin]], [[cyclamate]], [[aspartame]], [[acesulfame potassium]], [[sucralose]], [[alitame]], and [[neotame]].

==Sweetness modifiers==

A few substances alter the way sweet taste is perceived.  One class of these inhibits the perception of sweet tastes, whether from sugars or from highly potent sweeteners. Commercially, the most important of these is [[lactisole]],&lt;ref name="Kinghorn-book3"&gt;Kinghorn, A.D. and Compadre, C.M. Alternative Sweeteners: Third Edition, Revised and Expanded, Marcel Dekker ed., New York, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8247-0437-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a compound produced by [[Domino Sugar]].  It is used in some [[Jelly (fruit preserves)|jellies]] and other fruit preserves to bring out their fruit flavors by suppressing their otherwise strong sweetness.

Two natural products have been documented to have similar sweetness-inhibiting properties: [[gymnemic acid]], extracted from the leaves of the [[India]]n vine ''[[Gymnema sylvestre]]'' and [[ziziphin]], from the leaves of the Chinese [[jujube]] (''Ziziphus jujuba'').&lt;ref name="crfsn-32-231"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10408399209527598 |author=Kurihara Y |title=Characteristics of antisweet substances, sweet proteins, and sweetness-inducing proteins |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=231–52 |year=1992 |pmid=1418601 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gymnemic acid has been widely promoted within [[herbal medicine]] as a treatment for sugar cravings and [[diabetes mellitus]].

On the other hand, two plant proteins, [[miraculin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.161.3847.1241 |vauthors=Kurihara K, Beidler LM |title=Taste-Modifying Protein from Miracle Fruit |journal=Science |volume=161 |issue=3847 |pages=1241–3 |year=1968 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/161/3847/1241 |pmid=5673432 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024122852/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/161/3847/1241 |archivedate=2007-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[curculin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/chemse/20.2.239 |vauthors=Yamashita H, Akabane T, Kurihara Y |title=Activity and stability of a new sweet protein with taste-modifying action, curculin |journal=Chem.

Once the tongue has been exposed to either of these proteins, sourness is perceived as sweetness for up to an hour afterwards.  While curculin has some innate sweet taste of its own, miraculin is by itself quite tasteless.

==The sweetness receptor==
[[File:Gray1018.png|right|thumb|Sweetness is perceived by the taste buds.]]
Despite the wide variety of chemical substances known to be sweet, and knowledge that the ability to perceive sweet taste must reside in [[taste bud]]s on the [[tongue]], the biomolecular mechanism of sweet taste was sufficiently elusive that as recently as the 1990s, there was some doubt whether any single "sweetness receptor" actually exists.

The breakthrough for the present understanding of sweetness occurred in 2001, when experiments with [[laboratory mice]] showed that mice possessing different versions of the [[gene]] T1R3 prefer sweet foods to different extents. Subsequent research has shown that the [[TAS1R3|T1R3 protein]] forms a complex with a related protein, called [[TAS1R2|T1R2]], to form a [[G-protein coupled receptor]] that is the sweetness receptor in mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Li XD, Staszewski L, Xu H, Durick K, Zoller M, Adler E | title=Human receptors for sweet and umami taste  | journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | year=2002 | volume=99 | pages=4692–6 | doi=10.1073/pnas.072090199 | pmid=11917125 | issue=7 | pmc=123709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human studies have shown that sweet taste receptors are not only found in tongue, but also in the lining of gastrointestinal tract as well as nasal epithelium, pancreatic islet cells, sperm and testes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohno|first=Daisuke|date=2017-04-04|title=Sweet taste receptor in the hypothalamus: a potential new player in glucose sensing in the hypothalamus|journal=The Journal of Physiological Sciences|volume=67|issue=4|pages=459–465|doi=10.1007/s12576-017-0535-y|pmid=28378265|issn=1880-6546}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that the presence of sweet taste receptors in the GI tract controls the feeling of hunger and satiety.

Another research has shown that the threshold of sweet taste perception is in direct correlation with the time of day. This is believed to be the consequence of oscillating leptin levels in blood that may impact the overall sweetness of food. Scientists hypothesize that this is an evolutionary relict of diurnal animals like humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakamura|first=Y.|last2=Sanematsu|first2=K.|last3=Ohta|first3=R.|last4=Shirosaki|first4=S.|last5=Koyano|first5=K.|last6=Nonaka|first6=K.|last7=Shigemura|first7=N.|last8=Ninomiya|first8=Y.|date=2008-07-15|title=Diurnal Variation of Human Sweet Taste Recognition Thresholds Is Correlated With Plasma Leptin Levels|journal=Diabetes|volume=57|issue=10|pages=2661–2665|doi=10.2337/db07-1103|pmid=18633111|pmc=2551675|issn=0012-1797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweetness perception may differ between species significantly.  For example, even amongst the [[primate]]s sweetness is quite variable. [[New World monkey]]s do not find [[aspartame]] sweet, while [[Old World monkey]]s and [[ape]]s (including humans) all do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/chemse/20.5.573 | last1 = Nofre | first1 = C. | last2 = Tinti | first2 = J.

The ability to taste sweetness often atrophies genetically in species of carnivores who do not eat sweet foods like fruits, including [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[sea lion]]s, [[spotted hyena]]s and [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/animals/zoo-animals/carnivores-taste-sweet-120312.htm|title=RebelMouse vs. WordPress VIP|date=10 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525124426/http://news.discovery.com/animals/zoo-animals/carnivores-taste-sweet-120312.htm|archivedate=25 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweet receptor pathway==
To depolarize the cell, and ultimately generate a response, the body uses different cells in the taste bud that each express a receptor for the perception of sweet, sour, salty, bitter or [[umami]]. Downstream of the [[taste receptor]], the taste cells for sweet, bitter and umami share the same intracellular signalling pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaudhari|first1=N|last2=Roper|first2=SD|title=The cell biology of taste.|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=9 August 2010|volume=190|issue=3|pages=285–96|pmid=20696704|doi=10.1083/jcb.201003144|pmc=2922655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incoming sweet molecules bind to their receptors, which causes a conformational change in the molecule. This change activates the G-protein, gustducin, which in turn activates [[PLCB2|phospholipase C]] to generate inositol trisphosphate ([[Inositol trisphosphate|IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]), this subsequently opens the IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-receptor and induces calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. This increase in intracellular calcium activates the [[TRPM5]] channel and induces cellular [[depolarization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Philippaert|first1=Koenraad|last2=Pironet|first2=Andy|last3=Mesuere|first3=Margot|last4=Sones|first4=William|last5=Vermeiren|first5=Laura|last6=Kerselaers|first6=Sara|last7=Pinto|first7=Sílvia|last8=Segal|first8=Andrei|last9=Antoine|first9=Nancy|last10=Gysemans|first10=Conny|last11=Laureys|first11=Jos|last12=Lemaire|first12=Katleen|last13=Gilon|first13=Patrick|last14=Cuypers|first14=Eva|last15=Tytgat|first15=Jan|last16=Mathieu|first16=Chantal|last17=Schuit|first17=Frans|last18=Rorsman|first18=Patrik|last19=Talavera|first19=Karel|last20=Voets|first20=Thomas|last21=Vennekens|first21=Rudi|title=Steviol glycosides enhance pancreatic beta-cell function and taste sensation by potentiation of TRPM5 channel activity|journal=Nature Communications|date=31 March 2017|volume=8|pages=14733|doi=10.1038/ncomms14733|pmid=28361903|pmc=5380970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=YA|last2=Roper|first2=SD|title=Intracellular Ca(2+) and TRPM5-mediated membrane depolarization produce ATP secretion from taste receptor cells.|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=1 July 2010|volume=588|issue=Pt 13|pages=2343–50|pmid=20498227|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2010.191106|pmc=2915511}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] release channel [[CALHM1]] gets activated by the depolarization and releases ATP neurotransmitter which activates the afferent [[neuron]]s innervating the taste bud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taruno|first1=A|last2=Vingtdeux|first2=V|last3=Ohmoto|first3=M|last4=Ma|first4=Z|last5=Dvoryanchikov|first5=G|last6=Li|first6=A|last7=Adrien|first7=L|last8=Zhao|first8=H|last9=Leung|first9=S|last10=Abernethy|first10=M|last11=Koppel|first11=J|last12=Davies|first12=P|last13=Civan|first13=MM|last14=Chaudhari|first14=N|last15=Matsumoto|first15=I|last16=Hellekant|first16=G|last17=Tordoff|first17=MG|last18=Marambaud|first18=P|last19=Foskett|first19=JK|title=CALHM1 ion channel mediates purinergic neurotransmission of sweet, bitter and umami tastes.|journal=Nature|date=14 March 2013|volume=495|issue=7440|pages=223–6|pmid=23467090|doi=10.1038/nature11906|pmc=3600154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ma|first1=Z|last2=Siebert|first2=AP|last3=Cheung|first3=KH|last4=Lee|first4=RJ|last5=Johnson|first5=B|last6=Cohen|first6=AS|last7=Vingtdeux|first7=V|last8=Marambaud|first8=P|last9=Foskett|first9=JK|title=Calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) is the pore-forming subunit of an ion channel that mediates extracellular Ca2+ regulation of neuronal excitability.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=10 July 2012|volume=109|issue=28|pages=E1963–71|pmid=22711817|doi=10.1073/pnas.1204023109|pmc=3396471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognition==
The [[color]] of food can affect sweetness perception. Adding more red color to a drink increases its perceived sweetness.  In a study darker colored solutions were rated 2–10% higher than lighter ones despite having 1% less sucrose concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = J. | last2 = Clydesdale | first2 = F. | year = 1982 | title = Perceived sweetness and redness in colored sucrose solutions | journal = Journal of Food Science | volume = 47 | pages = 747–752 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2621.1982.tb12706.x | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of color is believed to be due to cognitive expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shankar | first1 = MU | last2 = Levitan | first2 = CA | last3 = Spence | first3 = C. |name-list-format=vanc | year = 2010 | title = Grape expectations: the role of cognitive influences in color-flavor interactions | journal = Conscious Cogn. | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 380–90 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2009.08.008 | pmid = 19828330 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some odors smell sweet and memory confuses whether sweetness was tasted or smelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stevenson | first1 = RJ | last2 = Oaten | first2 = MJ. |name-list-format=vanc | year = 2010 | title = Sweet odours and sweet tastes are conflated in memory | journal = Acta Psychol (Amst). | volume = 134 | issue = 1| pages = 105–9 | doi = 10.1016/j.actpsy.2010.01.001 | pmid = 20097323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical theories==
[[File:Lugduname.svg|left|thumb|[[Lugduname]] is the sweetest chemical known.]]
The development of [[organic chemistry]] in the 19th century introduced many new chemical compounds and the means to determine their [[molecular structure]]s.  Early organic chemists tasted many of their products, either intentionally (as a means of characterization) or accidentally (due to poor laboratory [[hygiene]]).  One of the first attempts to draw systematic correlations between molecules' structures and their tastes was made by a German chemist, Georg Cohn, in 1914.  He hypothesized that to evoke a certain taste, a molecule must contain some structural motif (called a ''sapophore'') that produces that taste. With regard to sweetness, he noted that molecules containing multiple [[hydroxyl]] groups and those containing [[chlorine]] atoms are often sweet, and that among a series of structurally similar compounds, those with smaller [[molecular weight]]s were often sweeter than the larger compounds.

In 1919, Oertly and Myers proposed a more elaborate theory based on a then-current theory of [[color]] in synthetic [[dye]]s.  They hypothesized that to be sweet, a compound must contain one each of two classes of structural motif, a ''glucophore'' and an ''auxogluc''.  Based on those compounds known to be sweet at the time, they proposed a list of six candidate glucophores and nine auxoglucs.

From these beginnings in the early 20th century, the theory of sweetness enjoyed little further academic attention until 1963, when [[Robert Shallenberger]] and [[Terry Acree]] proposed the AH-B theory of sweetness.  Simply put, they proposed that to be sweet, a compound must contain a [[hydrogen bond]] [[Electron donor|donor]] (AH) and a [[Lewis base]] (B) separated by about 0.3 [[nanometre]]s.  According to this theory, the AH-B unit of a sweetener binds with a corresponding AH-B unit on the biological sweetness receptor to produce the sensation of sweetness.

B-X theory proposed by [[Lemont Kier]] in 1972.  While previous researchers had noted that among some groups of compounds, there seemed to be a correlation between [[hydrophobicity]] and sweetness, this theory formalized these observations by proposing that to be sweet, a compound must have a third binding site (labeled X) that could interact with a hydrophobic site on the sweetness receptor via [[London dispersion force]]s.  Later researchers have statistically analyzed the distances between the presumed AH, B, and X sites in several families of sweet substances to estimate the distances between these interaction sites on the sweetness receptor.

==MPA theory==
The most elaborate theory of sweetness to date is the multipoint attachment theory (MPA) proposed by [[Jean-Marie Tinti]] and [[Claude Nofre]] in 1991.  This theory involves a total of eight interaction sites between a sweetener and the sweetness receptor, although not all sweeteners interact with all eight sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2008|title=Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Sweetness|journal=Chemosensory Perception|volume=1|issue=1|pages=48–57|doi=10.1007/s12078-007-9003-z|pmid=|author=John E. Hayes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model has successfully directed efforts aimed at finding highly potent sweeteners, including the most potent family of sweeteners known to date, the [[guanidine]] sweeteners.  The most potent of these, [[lugduname]], is about 225,000 times sweeter than sucrose.

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}

'''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Some variation in values is not uncommon between various studies. Such variations may arise from a range of methodological variables, from sampling to analysis and interpretation. Indeed, the taste index of 1, assigned to reference substances such as sucrose (for sweetness), hydrochloric acid (for sourness), quinine (for bitterness), and sodium chloride (for saltiness), is itself arbitrary for practical purposes.&lt;ref name=Guyton&amp;Hall2006/&gt;

Some values, such as those for maltose and glucose, vary little. Others, such as aspartame and sodium saccharin, have much larger variation. Regardless of variation, the perceived intensity of substances relative to each reference substance remains consistent for taste ranking purposes. The indices table for McLaughlin &amp; Margolskee (1994) for example,&lt;ref name="McLaughlin&amp;Margolskee"/&gt; is essentially the same as that of Svrivastava &amp; Rastogi (2003),&lt;ref name=Svrivastava&amp;Rastogi2003/&gt; Guyton &amp; Hall (2006),&lt;ref name=Guyton&amp;Hall2006/&gt; and Joesten ''et al.'' (2007).&lt;ref name=JoestenEal2007/&gt; The rankings are all the same, with any differences, where they exist, being in the values assigned from the studies from which they are derived.

The '''Teatro Dal Verme''' is a theatre in [[Milan]],  Italy located on the Via San Giovanni sul Muro, on the site of the former private theatre the ''Politeama Ciniselli''. It was designed by Giuseppe Pestagalli to a commission from Count Francesco Dal Verme, and was used primarily for plays and [[opera]] performances throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, the theatre is no longer used for opera, and is a venue for concerts, plays and dance performances, as well as exhibitions and conferences.

The original 3,000-seat theatre, surmounted by a large [[cupola]], was constructed in the traditional horseshoe shape, with two tiers of boxes and a large gallery (or ''loggione'') which alone contained more than 1000 seats. It opened on September 14, 1872 with a production of [[Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' and soon established itself as one of Italy's most important opera houses. During its "golden years", the theatre saw the world premieres of [[Puccini]]'s ''[[Le Villi]]'' (May 31, 1884); [[Leoncavallo]]'s  ''[[Pagliacci]]'' (May 21, 1892) and ''[[I Medici]]'' (November 9, 1893); and [[Frederic Hymen Cowen|Cowen]]'s ''[[Signa (opera)|Signa]]'' (November 12, 1893). It also saw the Italian premiere of [[Franz Lehár|Lehár]]'s ''[[Merry Widow|The Merry Widow]]'' (April 27, 1907).

By the 1930s, the theatre was mainly being used as a cinema. It was then severely damaged by American aerial bombardment during World War II, after which its magnificent central cupola, which had survived the bombing, was stripped of all its metal parts by the occupying German army. It was partially rebuilt in 1946, and for a period in the 1950s it was used for the performance of [[Musical theatre|musicals]]. It then reverted to a cinema and a political conference hall.

In 1991, the theatre's interior underwent a major restructuring and renovation project which was completed in 1998. It now has a large modern auditorium, the ''Sala Grande'', with 1420 seats, a smaller performing space known as the ''Sala Piccola'', with 200 seats, and a space for exhibitions and conferences, the ''Sala Terrazzo''. Since September 2001, it has been administered by the ''Fondazione I Pomeriggi Musicali'', whose orchestra (the [[Orchestra i Pomeriggi Musicali]]) is resident at the theatre.

'''''The Brahmin and the Mongoose''''' (or '''''The Brahmin's Wife and the Mongoose''''') is a folktale from [[India]], and "one of the world's most travelled tales".&lt;ref name=b494&gt;Blackburn, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the rash killing of a loyal animal, and thus warns against hasty action. The story underlies certain legends in the West, such as that of Llywelyn and his dog [[Gelert]] in Wales,&lt;ref name=b494/&gt; or that of [[Saint Guinefort]] in France.&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt;&lt;ref name=b496/&gt; It is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 178A.&lt;ref&gt;D.

==The story==

The original version from the [[Panchatantra]] in [[Sanskrit]] goes as follows (translation from {{Harvnb|Ryder|1925}}):
{{quote|
The Loyal Mongoose{{efn|The source uses the spelling "mungoose" throughout; the spelling has been here modernized to "mongoose" for consistency with the rest of the article.}}

There was once a Brahman named Godly [orig. ''Devasharma''] in a certain town. His wife mothered a single son and a mongoose. And as she loved little ones, she cared for the mongoose also like a son, giving him milk from her breast, and salves, and baths, and so on. But she did not trust him, for she thought: “A mongoose is a nasty kind of creature. He might hurt my boy.” [...]

One day she tucked her son in bed, took a waterjar, and said to her husband: “Now, Professor, I am going for water. You must protect the boy from the mongoose.” But when she was gone, the Brahman went off somewhere himself to beg food, leaving the house empty.

While he was gone, a black snake issued from his hole and, as fate would have it, crawled toward the baby’s cradle. But the mongoose, feeling him to be a natural enemy, and fearing for the life of his baby brother, fell upon the vicious serpent halfway, joined battle with him, tore him to bits, and tossed the pieces far and wide. Then, delighted with his own heroism, he ran, blood trickling from his mouth, to meet the mother; for he wished to show what he had done.

But when the mother saw him coming, saw his bloody mouth and his excitement, she feared that the villain must have eaten her baby boy, and without thinking twice, she angrily dropped the water-jar upon him, which killed him the moment that it struck. There she left him without a second thought, and hurried home, where she found the baby safe and sound, and near the cradle a great black snake, torn to bits. Then, overwhelmed with sorrow because she had thoughtlessly killed her benefactor, her son, she beat her head and breast.

At this moment the Brahman came home with a dish of rice gruel which he had got from someone in his begging tour, and saw his wife bitterly lamenting her son, the mongoose. “Greedy! Greedy!” she cried. “Because you did not do as I told you, you must now taste the bitterness of a son’s death, the fruit of the tree of your own wickedness. Yes, this is what happens to those blinded by greed....”
}}

In Western variants of the story, other animals take the place of the mongoose, most often a dog. It is also found in other versions as a [[weasel]], cat (in Persia), bear, or lion, and the snake is sometimes replaced with a wolf (in Wales). The essence of the story, however, remains the same. Similarly, variants of the story sometimes have the man, instead of his wife, killing the loyal animal.&lt;ref name=b498&gt;Blackburn, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is sometimes placed within a frame story, where a saviour stands mistakenly accused and narrates this story, thereby preventing his own death.&lt;ref name=b&gt;Blackburn&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and travel==
The story was first studied in 1859 by [[Theodor Benfey]], the pioneer of comparative literature, when he compared the versions in India, the Middle East and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Benfey, Theodor S. 1859. Pantschatantra.2 vols. Leipzig: F. W. Brockhaus; Benfey, Theodor S. 1862. 'Ueber die alte deutsche Uebersetzung des Kalilah und Dimnah', Orient und Occident, 1: 138-187.&lt;/ref&gt;In 1884, W. A. Clouston showed how it had reached Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Clouston, W. A. 1884. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UnEAAAAAMAAJ The Book of Sindibad]. Glasgow: privately printed.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gelert.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Gelert]]'' by [[Charles Burton Barber]] (1845–1894)]] 
[[Murray B. Emeneau]] considers the migration of this story, through its steps from India to Wales, as "one of the best authenticated cases of such diffusions of folk-tales".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi =  10.2307/985117| jstor = 985117 | pages = 503–513 | title = A Classical Indian Folk-Tale as a Reported Modern Event: the Brahman and the Mongoose | journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | publisher = American Philosophical Society | year = 1940| author1 = Emeneau | first1 = M. B.}}, p.507&lt;/ref&gt;  It is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 178A.&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Ashliman, ''[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0178a.html Llewellyn and His Dog Gellert and other folktales of Aarne-Thompson type 178A]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The story occurs in all versions of the [[Panchatantra]], as well as the later Sanskrit works [[Hitopadesha]]&lt;ref name=hitopadesha&gt;
{{citation | year=2007 | title = "Friendly advice" by Nārāyaṇa and "King Vikrama's adventures" | author1=Nārāyaṇa | author2=Judit Törzsök (transl.) | publisher=NYU Press and [[Clay Sanskrit Library]] | isbn=978-0-8147-8305-4 | pages=513–515 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KdV9dMQci9sC&amp;pg=PA513}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kathasaritsagara]].
It also occurs in most of the languages of India (and South Asia) where it is extremely familiar.
For instance, in the [[South India]]n state of [[Karnataka]], the story occurs as a proverb in inscriptions,&lt;ref name=b496&gt;Blackburn, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; as a sculpture in a temple,&lt;ref&gt;
Mallikarjuna Temple at [[Pattadakal]], Karnataka, eighth century. See:
* C. S. Patil (1995), ''Panchatantra in Karnataka sculptures'', Mysore: Directorate of Archaeology and Museums.
&lt;/ref&gt; in narratives of travelling storytellers and singers,&lt;ref&gt;
Blackburn p.505 and 499. Found as ''The Sati of Sulochana'' in a collection of bard-stories:
* Kyathanahalli Rāmaṇṇa (1972), ''Gondalingara Kathegalu''. Mysore: Institute for Kannada Studies.
&lt;/ref&gt; and in film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0MHirNAR9o Nodiddu sullagabahudu (video)] ("Things are not always what they seem"), from ''Rama Lakshmana'' (1980). Note that here, too, the story is framed within another story of an unjustly accused animal (a pet tiger).&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] epic ''[[Silappatikaram]]'' recalls the story simply by its name.

Like the rest of the Panchatantra, in its westward migration it travelled from Sanskrit to Arabic (as ''Kalila wa Dimna''), Persian, [[Hebrew]], Greek, Latin, Old French, and eventually into all the major languages of Europe (as ''The Fables of Pilpay'' or ''Bidpai''), ranging from Russian to [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] to English. 
In its eastward migration, it appears in Chinese (ten versions, including in a redaction of the Vinaya Pitaka), and over a wide region from Mongolia to Malaysia.
It is also the only story found in all recensions of the Panchatantra, all versions of the 'Book of Sindibad' (not [[Sindbad]]),
and all versions of '[[Seven Wise Masters|The Seven Sages of Rome]]'.&lt;ref name=b495&gt;Blackburn, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also found in Mexico and the United States. Blackburn observes that the fable is not a dead tradition and is still current, as a Belgian newspaper reported it as an anecdote about a man who left his son and dog in a shopping trolley in his car.&lt;ref name=b495/&gt;

The motif also occurs, with a happy ending, in the Disney film ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955).&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt;

==Reception/influence==
The story is often used in culture as an [[exemplum]] cautioning against hasty action. In addition, it also serves as shorthand for sin, regret and grief.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

In Welsh it became the story of the nobleman Llywelyn who kills his loyal dog, [[Gelert]]. It was later interpreted as a legend about a true event, and small shrines to the dog exist in Wales (such as in the village of [[Beddgelert]], "Gelert's grave"). In France a similar metamorphosis took larger proportions, and the story became the cult of [[Saint Guinefort]] (a dog), which was popular until the 1930s.&lt;ref name=greenwood&gt;{{citation | author=Stephen Belcher | contribution=Panchatantra | title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales | editor=Donald Haase | year=2008 | volume=2 | pages=723–725 | isbn=978-0-313-33441-2 | quote=…is a saint's legend behind a pilgrimage site in France.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, p. 496. {{quote|When the dog replaced the mongoose, the tale was commonly interpreted as a legend (that is as a true event), and the loyal animal's undeserving death was commemorated by small shrines to the dog not only in Wales but also in north India […] On a larger scale, this tale inspired the cult of St. Guinefort in France…}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackburn points out that although in the many literary versions it is the man who kills the mongoose, in most ''oral'' versions (and even the literary version quoted above), it is the woman who does so. Further, ''both'' literary and oral versions place the woman at the centre of the story, emphasizing her maternal feelings toward the animal, her mixture of love and fear, and her grief at its death. Thus he asserts that "the tale is a drama enacted between a mother and her son" and proposes some interpretations.&lt;ref name=b501&gt;Blackburn, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Grace Lee Project''''' is a 2005 American documentary film directed and co-written by [[Grace Lee (director)|Grace Lee]].  It is about Lee's attempt to define a common set of stereotypes associated with the name that she shares with the film's subjects.

== Synopsis ==
Growing up in [[Columbia, Missouri]], director Grace Lee felt that she had a unique name and identity, as there were not many other Asians in her community.  When she moved to [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]], she found her name shared by many other people.  Dissatisfied with the "nice" personality commonly ascribed to the Asian-American women with this name, she sets out to find people who break the mold, including [[Grace Lee Boggs]], a Chinese-American philosopher and activist.

== Production ==
Lee traveled throughout the United States to meet other people with her name.  Although she heard from non-Asians, she chose to focus solely on people of Asian descent.  Funding was made possible through public television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2002/11/14/features/index.html|title=Exploring 'Grace' land|last=Kam|first=Nadine|work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|date=2002-11-14|accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==
''The Grace Lee Project'' opened in New York on December 14, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.documentary.org/magazine/hello-my-name-grace-lee|title=Hello, My Name is Grace Lee|last=Krinsky|first=Tamara|work=[[International Documentary Association]]|accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 95% of 21 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7.1/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1154355-grace_lee_project/|title=The Grace Lee Project (2005)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Metacritic]] rated it 63/100 based on twelve reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-grace-lee-project|title=The Grace Lee Project|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film's "trivial-sounding hook manages to float a funny but complex meditation on identity, ethnicity and cultural expectations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/reviews/the-grace-lee-project-1200526554/|title=Review: 'The Grace Lee Project'|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2005-04-12|accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  John Anderson of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "a journey of realization for anyone who's ever felt lost in the crowd."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/31/entertainment/et-grace31|title='Grace Lee' and company|last=Anderson|first=John|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2006-03-31|accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as a witty autobiography that is "really about cultural assimilation and a stereotype of virtue and subservience that has deep roots on both sides of the Pacific."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/14/movies/14proj.html?_r=0|title=Who Can Grace Lee Be?

'''Tympan''' means skin, and is used in a variety of technical meanings.

*Astrolabes
In an [[astrolabe]], a tympan is a [[metal]] [[plate (metal)|plate]] on which the [[coordinates]] of the [[celestial sphere]] ([[azimuth]] and [[altitude]]) are engraved in a [[stereographic projection]]. A tympan is specific to a particular [[latitude]], so most astrolabes come with a set of interchangeable tympans suitable for use at different latitudes, usually those of particular cities of importance ([[Cairo]], [[Mecca]], [[Medina]], [[Jerusalem]]...).

*Printing
&lt;!--What about a picture?--&gt;
In hand-operated [[letterpress]] printing, the '''bruzer tympan''' is the taut cloth or paper mounted in a frame which is placed over the sheet of paper immediately prior to lowering the [[platen]] to make the impression.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tympan&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruzer's Tympan refers to a sheet of oiled manilla paper which was securely fastened to the face of the platen of a letterpress printing machine. Underneath the tympan would be a packing which would vary in grade of firmness relevant to the type or image to be printed.
Pre-cut tympan papers were relatively expensive and, as such, were reused depending on their condition and the nature of the work.
The under packing consisted of loose fibre paper/board (sometimes known as saffron) which absorbed the impact of the letterpress principle thus avoiding damage to the hand-set or pre-cast typography or engravings.

The '''Video Standards Council''' (VSC) is an administrator of the [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] system of [[Video game rating|age rating for video games]]. It was established in 1989, and has been responsible for the age ratings of [[video game]]s sold in the UK since 2012.&lt;ref name="BBCVSC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Video Standards Council to take over games age ratings|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18017385|publisher=BBC News|date=10 May 2012|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation is accountable to the [[Department of Culture, Media and Sport]].

==History==
The VSC was established in 1989 following concerns from the [[Home Secretary]] about the video industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VSC - ParentPort|url=http://www.parentport.org.uk/find-out-more/VSC|website=www.parentport.org.uk|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation designed a [[Code of practice|code of practise]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origins of the VSC|url=http://www.videostandards.org.uk/VSC/origins.html|publisher=The Video Standards Council|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure that the video and [[video game industry|video games industries]] delivered their products to the public responsibly. It also provides [[retailer]]s with staff training courses concerning the supply of age restricted videos, DVDs, and video games.

Since 1994, the VSC has been responsible for the age ratings of video games. Initially, they worked on behalf of the [[UK Interactive Entertainment Association]] (formerly ELSPA). Since 2003, they have been administrators of the [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI system]], which was incorporated into [[Law of the United Kingdom|UK law]] in 2012. Since then, the VSC has been the [[statutory body]] responsible for the age rating of video games in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Video Standards Council|url=http://videostandards.org.uk/VSC/|website=videostandards.org.uk|accessdate=17 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it does through its sub-body, the Games Rating Authority (GRA). The GRA also rates games for at least 30 other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Games Rating Authority|url=http://www.videostandards.org.uk/GRA/|publisher=The Video Standards Council|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isn't the GRA a new company?|url=http://www.gamesratingauthority.org/pegi/gra.html|publisher=Games Rating Authority|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Standards Council Releases Annual Report on UK Video Games Ratings|url=http://gamepolitics.com/2013/07/23/video-standards-council-releases-annual-report-uk-video-games-ratings#.Uu45UHm2v4I|publisher=Game Politics|date=23 July 2013|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox artwork|title=Virgil Mosaic|caption=Virgil Mosaic|artist=Unknown|museum=Bardo National Museum|city=[[Le Bardo]]|image=Virgil mosaic in the Bardo National Museum (Tunis) (12241228546).jpg|medium=Mosaic}}
The '''Mosaic of Virgil''' is a [[mosaic]] found on the site of the ancient [[Hadrumetum]] and currently preserved in [[Bardo National Museum (Tunis)|Bardo National Museum]] in [[Tunis]], where it constitutes one of its key pieces. It is currently the oldest portrait of the [[Latin poet]] [[Virgil]].

== History ==
The mosaic&lt;ref&gt;A. 226&lt;/ref&gt; was discovered in 1896 in a garden of [[Sousse]] and constitutes the emblem of a larger mosaic.

== Description ==
It is included in a frame of 1.22-meter side.&lt;ref&gt;Hédi Slim, Ammar Mahjoubi et Khaled Belkhodja, ''Histoire générale de la Tunisie'', tome I " L'Antiquité ", éd.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Central character ===
[[File:Virgile_et_les_muses_02.jpg|thumb|Detail of the central character identified as Virgil]]
[[File:Virgile_et_les_muses_04.jpg|left|thumb|Detail of the parchment]]
It represents the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet Virgil, dressed in a white [[toga]] decorated with embroidery.

The poet holds in his hand, which is placed on his knees, a roll of [[parchment]] on which are written extracts of the [[Aeneid]], more precisely the eighth verse:&lt;ref&gt;Aïcha Ben Abed-Ben Khader, ''Le musée du Bardo'', éd.&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Musa, mihi causas memora, quo numine laeso, quidve..."''

=== Muses ===
He is surrounded by the [[muses]] [[Clio]] and [[Melpomene]]: Clio, the muse of history, is placed on the left of the poet and shown reading, while Melpomene, the muse of tragedy, is holding a tragic mask.

== Interpretation ==
The work is the oldest known representation of the poet to date. Some have seen it, according to [[Mohamed Yacoub]], a representation of the owner of the house, passionate about the poet. The dating of the pavement ranged from 1st to 4th century but can not exceed the 3rd century, due to the archaeological context of its discovery according to the same author.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Yacoub, ''Le Musée du Bardo : départements antiques'', éd. Agence nationale du patrimoine, Tunis, 1993, pp. 153–154&lt;/ref&gt;

'''François-Marie Arouet''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃swa maʁi aʁwɛ|lang}}; 21 November 1694{{snd}}30 May 1778), known by his ''[[Pen name|nom de plume]]'' '''Voltaire''' ({{IPAc-en|v|oʊ|l|ˈ|t|ɛər}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/voltaire "Voltaire"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|vɔltɛːʁ|lang}}), was a French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writer, historian and [[Philosophy|philosopher]] famous for his wit, his criticism of [[Christianity]], especially the [[Catholic Church]], and his advocacy of [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of speech]], and [[separation of church and state]].

Voltaire was a versatile and prolific writer, producing works in almost every literary form, including plays, poems, novels, essays and historical and scientific works. He wrote more than 20,000 letters and more than 2,000 books and pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographyonline.net/writers/voltaire.html|title=Voltaire – Biography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an outspoken advocate of civil liberties, despite the risk this placed him in under the strict censorship laws of the time. As a [[Satire|satirical]] [[polemic]]ist, he frequently made use of his works to criticize intolerance, religious dogma and the French institutions of his day.

== Biography ==
François-Marie Arouet was born in Paris, the youngest of the five children of François Arouet (19 August 1649{{snd}}1 January 1722), a lawyer who was a minor treasury official, and his wife, Marie Marguerite Daumard (c. 1660{{snd}}13 July 1701), whose family was on the lowest rank of the [[French nobility]].{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=9–14}} Some speculation surrounds Voltaire's date of birth, because he claimed he was born on 20 February 1694 as the illegitimate son of a nobleman, Guérin de Rochebrune or Roquebrune.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=9}} Two of his older brothers—Armand-François and Robert—died in infancy, and his surviving brother Armand and sister Marguerite-Catherine were nine and seven years older, respectively.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=10}} Nicknamed "Zozo" by his family, Voltaire was baptized on 22 November 1694, with {{ill|François de Châteauneuf|fr|lt=François de Castagnère, abbé de Châteauneuf}}, and Marie Daumard, the wife of his mother's cousin, standing as godparents.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=12}} He was educated by the [[Jesuits]] at the [[Collège Louis-le-Grand]] (1704–1711), where he was taught [[Latin]], theology, and [[rhetoric]];{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=24–25}} later in life he became fluent in Italian, Spanish, and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/voltaire.htm|title=Voltaire|website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri|last=Liukkonen|publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library|location=Finland|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217150230/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/voltaire.htm|archivedate=17 February 2015|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time he left school, Voltaire had decided he wanted to be a writer, against the wishes of his father, who wanted him to become a lawyer.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=32–33}} Voltaire, pretending to work in Paris as an assistant to a notary, spent much of his time writing poetry. When his father found out, he sent Voltaire to study law, this time in [[Caen]], [[Normandy]]. But the young man continued to write, producing essays and historical studies. Voltaire's wit made him popular among some of the aristocratic families with whom he mixed. In 1713, his father obtained a job for him as a secretary to the new French ambassador in the Netherlands, the {{ill|Pierre-Antoine de Châteauneuf|fr|lt=marquis de Châteauneuf}}, the brother of Voltaire's godfather.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=36}} At [[The Hague]], Voltaire fell in love with a [[Huguenot|French Protestant]] refugee named Catherine Olympe Dunoyer (known as 'Pimpette').{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=36}} Their affair, considered scandalous, was discovered by de Châteauneuf and Voltaire was forced to return to France by the end of the year.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=36–37}}

[[File:Bastille 1715.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Voltaire was imprisoned in the [[Bastille]] from 16 May 1717 to 15 April 1718 in a windowless cell with ten-foot-thick walls.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=43, 45}}]]
Most of Voltaire's early life revolved around Paris. From early on, Voltaire had trouble with the authorities for critiques of the government. As a result, he was twice sentenced to prison and once to temporary exile to England. One satirical verse, in which Voltaire accused the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Régent]] of incest with his daughter, resulted in an eleven-month imprisonment in the [[Bastille]].&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Martin (2000). "Toleration and the Enlightenment Movement" in Grell/Porter, ''Toleration in Enlightenment Europe'', p. 64, footnote 91, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Comédie-Française]]'' had agreed in January 1717 to stage his debut play, ''[[Oedipe (play)|Œdipe]]'', and it opened in mid-November 1718, seven months after his release.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=49–50}} Its immediate critical and financial success established his reputation.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=50–52}} Both the Régent and King [[George I of Great Britain]] presented Voltaire with medals as a mark of their appreciation.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=52}}

He mainly argued for religious tolerance and freedom of thought. He campaigned to eradicate priestly and aristo-monarchical authority, and supported a constitutional monarchy that protects people's rights.&lt;ref name="Shank" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Perry et al (2015), ''Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society'', Volume II, {{ISBN|978-1-305-09142-9}}, p. 427&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Name ===
The author adopted the name Voltaire in 1718, following his incarceration at the Bastille. Its origin is unclear. It is an [[anagram]] of ''AROVET LI'', the Latinized spelling of his surname, Arouet, and the initial letters of ''le jeune'' ("the young").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Voltaire|work=Profiles in literature series|author=Christopher Thacker|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1971|isbn=978-0-7100-7020-3|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D5s9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a family tradition among the descendants of his sister, he was known as ''le petit volontaire'' ("determined little thing") as a child, and he resurrected a variant of the name in his adult life.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=17}} The name also [[Verlan|reverses the syllables]] of [[Airvault]], his family's home town in the [[Poitou]] region.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=24}}

[[Richard Holmes (biographer)|Richard Holmes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Holmes, Richard|title=Sidetracks: Explorations of a Romantic Biographer|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2000|pages=345–66}} and "Voltaire's Grin" in ''New York Review of Books'', 30 November 1995, pp. 49–55&lt;/ref&gt; supports the anagrammatic derivation of the name, but adds that a writer such as Voltaire would have intended it to also convey connotations of speed and daring. These come from associations with words such as ''[[Equestrian vaulting|voltige]]'' (acrobatics on a trapeze or horse), ''[[volte-face]]'' (a spinning about to face one's enemies), and ''volatile'' (originally, any winged creature). "Arouet" was not a noble name fit for his growing reputation, especially given that name's resonance with ''à rouer'' ("to be beaten up") and ''roué'' (a ''débauché'').

In a letter to [[Jean-Baptiste Rousseau]] in March 1719, Voltaire concludes by asking that, if Rousseau wishes to send him a return letter, he do so by addressing it to Monsieur de Voltaire. A postscript explains: "''J'ai été si malheureux sous le nom d'Arouet que j'en ai pris un autre surtout pour n'être plus confondu avec le poète Roi''", (I was so unhappy under the name of Arouet that I have taken another, primarily so as to cease to be confused with the poet Roi.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-enlightenment.com/item/voltfrVF0850079_1key001cor – "Voltaire to Jean Baptiste Rousseau, c. 1 March 1719"]. Electronic Enlightenment. Ed. Robert McNamee et al. Vers. 2.1. University of Oxford. 2010. Web. 20 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This probably refers to [[Adenes le Roi]], and the 'oi' diphthong was then pronounced like modern 'ouai', so the similarity to 'Arouet' is clear, and thus, it could well have been part of his rationale. Voltaire is known also to have used at least 178 separate pen names during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/078640423X|title=A Dictionary of Pseudonyms and Their Origins, with Stories of Name Changes, 3rd Edition|first=search|last=results|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Mcfarland &amp; Co Inc Pub|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early fiction ===
Voltaire's next play, ''[[Artémire (tragedy)|Artémire]]'', set in ancient Macedonia, opened on 15 February 1720. It was a flop and only fragments of the text survive.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=54}} He instead turned to an epic poem about [[Henry IV of France]] that he had begun in early 1717.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=55}} Denied a licence to publish, in August 1722 Voltaire headed north to find a publisher outside France. On the journey, he was accompanied by his mistress, Marie-Marguerite de Rupelmonde, a young widow.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=57}}

At Brussels, Voltaire and Rousseau met up for a few days, before Voltaire and his mistress continued northwards. A publisher was eventually secured in The Hague.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=59}} In the Netherlands, Voltaire was struck and impressed by the openness and tolerance of Dutch society.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=60–61}} On his return to France, he secured a second publisher in [[Rouen]], who agreed to publish ''[[Henriade|La Henriade]]'' clandestinely.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=61}} After Voltaire's recovery from a month-long [[smallpox]] infection in November 1723, the first copies were smuggled into Paris and distributed.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=62}} While the poem was an instant success, Voltaire's new play, ''[[Hérode et Mariamne|Mariamne]]'', was a failure when it first opened in March 1724.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=64}} Heavily reworked, it opened at the ''Comédie-Française'' in April 1725 to a much-improved reception.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=64}} It was among the entertainments provided at the wedding of [[Louis XV]] and [[Marie Leszczyńska]] in September 1725.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=64}}

In early 1726, a young French nobleman, the [[chevalier de Rohan-Chabot]], taunted Voltaire about his change of name, and Voltaire retorted that his name would be honored while de Rohan would dishonor his.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=65}} Infuriated, de Rohan arranged for Voltaire to be beaten up by thugs a few days later.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=66}} Seeking compensation, redress, or revenge, Voltaire challenged de Rohan to a duel, but the aristocratic de Rohan family arranged for Voltaire to be arrested and imprisoned in the [[Bastille]] on 17 April 1726 without a trial or an opportunity to defend himself.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=66–67}}&lt;ref name="The Life of Voltaire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegreatdebate.org.uk/Voltaire.html|title=The Life of Voltaire|publisher=Thegreatdebate.org.uk|accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing an indefinite prison sentence, Voltaire suggested that he be exiled to England as an alternative punishment, which the French authorities accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/7567947/Voltaire-in-England.html|title=Voltaire in England|first=Ian|last=Davidson|date=9 April 2010|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 May, he was escorted from the Bastille to [[Calais]], where he was to embark for Britain.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=67}}

[[File:Voltaire - Elémens de la philosophie de Neuton, 1738 - 4270772.tif|thumb|''Elémens de la philosophie de Neuton'', 1738]]
In England, Voltaire lived largely in [[Wandsworth]], with acquaintances including [[Everard Fawkener]].{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=76, 80, 83}} From December 1727 to June 1728 he lodged at Maiden Lane, [[Covent Garden]], now commemorated by a plaque, to be nearer to his British publisher.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=82}} Voltaire circulated throughout English high society, meeting [[Alexander Pope]], [[John Gay]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]], [[Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough]], and many other members of the nobility and royalty.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=78–82}} Voltaire's exile in Great Britain greatly influenced his thinking. He was intrigued by Britain's [[constitutional monarchy]] in contrast to French [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]], and by the country's greater support of the freedoms of speech and religion.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=69–70}} He was influenced by the writers of the age, and developed an interest in earlier English literature, especially the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], still relatively unknown in continental Europe.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=77}} Despite pointing out his deviations from neoclassical standards, Voltaire saw Shakespeare as an example that French writers might emulate, since French drama, despite being more polished, lacked on-stage action. Later, however, as Shakespeare's influence began growing in France, Voltaire tried to set a contrary example with his own plays, decrying what he considered Shakespeare's barbarities. Voltaire may have been present at the funeral of [[Isaac Newton]],{{efn|Dobre and Nyden suggest that there is no clear evidence that Voltaire was present; see {{cite book|title=Cartesian Empiricism|author=Mihnea Dobre, Tammy Nyden|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=978-94-007-7690-6|page=89}}}} and met Newton's niece, [[Catherine Conduitt]].{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=82}} In 1727, he published two essays in English, ''Upon the Civil Wars of France, Extracted from Curious Manuscripts'' and ''Upon Epic Poetry of the European Nations, from [[Homer]] Down to [[John Milton|Milton]]''.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=82}}

After two and a half years in exile, Voltaire returned to France, and after a few months living in [[Dieppe]], the authorities permitted him to return to Paris.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=85}} At a dinner, French mathematician [[Charles Marie de La Condamine]] proposed buying up the lottery that was organized by the French government to pay off its debts, and Voltaire joined the consortium, earning perhaps a million [[French livre|livres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Newton Wars|first=J.

He was now indisputably rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Voltaire: A Life|first=Ian|last=Davidson|page=76|year=2010|publisher=Profile Books, London|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CZtxit17DSsC|isbn= 9781846682261}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=87}}

Further success followed, in 1732, with his play ''[[Zaïre (play)|Zaïre]]'', which when published in 1733 carried a dedication to Fawkener that praised English liberty and commerce.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=92–93, 95}} At this time he published his views on British attitudes toward government, literature, religion and science in a collection of essays in letter form entitled ''[[Letters on the English|Letters Concerning the English Nation]]'' (London, 1733).{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=97}} In 1734, they were published in French as ''Lettres philosophiques'' in [[Rouen]].{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=99}}{{efn|Contrary to the idea that Voltaire wrote the ''Letters'' in English, they were written in French and then translated into English by [[John Lockman]].{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=97}}}} Because the publisher released the book without the approval of the royal censor and Voltaire regarded the British constitutional monarchy as more developed and more respectful of human rights (particularly religious tolerance) than its French counterpart, the French publication of ''Letters'' caused a huge scandal; the book was [[Book burning|publicly burnt]] and banned, and Voltaire was forced again to flee Paris.&lt;ref name="Shank"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voltaire|first=J.

=== Château de Cirey ===
[[File:Voltaire Philosophy of Newton frontispiece.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|In the frontispiece to Voltaire's book on Newton's philosophy, [[Émilie du Châtelet]] appears as Voltaire's muse, reflecting Newton's heavenly insights down to Voltaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shank|first=J.

In 1733, Voltaire met [[Émilie du Châtelet]], a married mother of three who was 12 years his junior and with whom he was to have an affair for 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schiff|first1=Stacy|title='Voltaire In Love': An Ardent, Intellectual Affair|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/14/132740102/voltaire-in-love-an-ardent-intellectual-affair|website=npr books|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid arrest after the publication of ''Letters'', Voltaire took refuge at her husband's château at [[Cirey-sur-Blaise]], on the borders of [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] and [[Lorraine (région)|Lorraine]].{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=117–21}} Voltaire paid for the building's renovation,{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=122}} and Émilie's husband, the Marquis du Châtelet, sometimes stayed at the château with his wife and her lover.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=155, 157}} The relationship had a significant intellectual element. Voltaire and the Marquise du Châtelet collected around 21,000 books, an enormous number for the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.visitvoltaire.com/love_story_voltaire.htm|title=Voltaire and Emilie du Chatelet|website=Château de Cirey - Residence of Voltaire|accessdate=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they studied these books and performed experiments in the [[natural science]]s at Cirey, which included an attempt to determine the nature of fire.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=128, 138–39}}

Having learned from his previous brushes with the authorities, Voltaire began his habit of keeping out of personal harm's way and denying any awkward responsibility.{{sfn|Saintsbury|1911|p=201}} He continued to write plays, such as ''[[Mérope]]'' (or ''La Mérope française'') and began his long research into science and history. Again, a main source of inspiration for Voltaire were the years of his British exile, during which he had been strongly influenced by the works of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. Voltaire strongly believed in Newton's theories; he performed experiments in [[optics]] at Cirey,{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=138}} and was one of the sources for the famous story of Newton and the apple falling from the tree, which he had learned from Newton's niece in London and first mentioned in his ''Letters''.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=82}}

[[File:Maurice Quentin de La Tour, portrait de Voltaire (1735) avec agrandissement.jpg|thumb|190px|Pastel by [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]], 1735]]
In the fall of 1735, Voltaire was visited by [[Francesco Algarotti]], who was preparing a book about Newton in Italian.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=137}} Partly inspired by the visit, the Marquise translated Newton's Latin ''Principia'' into French in full, and it remained the definitive French translation into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Shank" /&gt; Both she and Voltaire were also curious about the philosophies of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], a contemporary and rival of Newton. While Voltaire remained a firm Newtonian, the Marquise adopted certain aspects of Leibniz's arguments against Newton.&lt;ref name="Shank" /&gt;{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=153}} Voltaire's own book ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Newton|Elements of Newton's Philosophy]]'' made Newton accessible and understandable to a far greater public, and the Marquise wrote a celebratory review in the ''[[Journal des savants]]''.&lt;ref name="Shank" /&gt;{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=140–41}} Voltaire's work was instrumental in bringing about general acceptance of Newton's optical and gravitational theories in France.&lt;ref name="Shank" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Walter W.|last=Bryant|title=A History of Astronomy|year=1907|url=https://archive.org/stream/AHistoryOfAstronomy/Bryant-AHistoryOfAstronomy#page/n75|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voltaire and the Marquise also studied history, particularly those persons who had contributed to civilization. Voltaire's second essay in English had been "Essay upon the Civil Wars in France". It was followed by ''La Henriade'', an epic poem on the French [[King Henri IV]], glorifying his attempt to end the Catholic-Protestant massacres with the [[Edict of Nantes]], and by a historical novel on King [[Charles XII of Sweden]]. These, along with his ''Letters on the English'' mark the beginning of Voltaire's open criticism of intolerance and established religions.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Voltaire and the Marquise also explored philosophy, particularly [[metaphysics]], the branch of philosophy that deals with being and with what lies beyond the material realm, such as whether or not there is a God and whether people have souls. Voltaire and the Marquise analyzed the Bible and concluded that much of its content was dubious.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=129–30}} Voltaire's critical views on religion are reflected in his belief in [[separation of church and state]] and religious freedom, ideas that he had formed after his stay in England.

In August 1736, [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]], then Crown Prince of Prussia and a great admirer of Voltaire, initiated a correspondence with him.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=143–44}} That December, Voltaire moved to [[Holland]] for two months and became acquainted with the scientists [[Herman Boerhaave]] and [['s Gravesande]].{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=151–52}} From mid-1739 to mid-1740 Voltaire lived largely in Brussels, at first with the Marquise, who was unsuccessfully attempting to pursue a 60-year-old family legal case regarding the ownership of two estates in [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]].{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=162–64}} In July 1740, he traveled to the Hague on behalf of Frederick in an attempt to dissuade a dubious publisher, van Duren, from printing without permission Frederick's ''[[Anti-Machiavel]]''.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=166}} In September Voltaire and Frederick (now King) met for the first time in [[Moyland Castle]] near [[Cleves]] and in November Voltaire was Frederick's guest in Berlin for two weeks;{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=167–70}} in September 1742 they met in [[Aix-la-Chapelle]].{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=173}} Voltaire was sent to Frederick's court in 1743 by the French government as an envoy and spy to gauge Frederick's military intentions in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=175–77}}

Though deeply committed to the Marquise, Voltaire by 1744 found life at the château confining. On a visit to Paris that year, he found a new love—his niece. At first, his attraction to [[Marie Louise Mignot]] was clearly sexual, as evidenced by his letters to her (only discovered in 1957).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=99Rnph1FGxcC&amp;pg=PA6|last=Davidson|first=Ian|title=Voltaire in Exile|page=6|publisher=Grove Press|year=1979|isbn=978-0-8021-4236-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1980|p=392}} Much later, they lived together, perhaps platonically, and remained together until Voltaire's death. Meanwhile, the Marquise also took a lover, the [[Jean François de Saint-Lambert|Marquis de Saint-Lambert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=99Rnph1FGxcC&amp;pg=PA7|last=Davidson|first=Ian|title=Voltaire in Exile|page=7|publisher=Grove Press|year=1979 |isbn=978-0-8021-4236-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prussia ===
[[File:Tafelrunde.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|''Die Tafelrunde'' by [[Adolph von Menzel]]: guests of Frederick the Great at [[Sanssouci]], including members of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] and Voltaire (third from left)]]
After the death of the Marquise in childbirth in September 1749, Voltaire briefly returned to Paris and in mid-1750 moved to [[Prussia]] at the invitation of Frederick the Great.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=214–17}} The Prussian king (with the permission of Louis XV) made him a chamberlain in his household, appointed him to the [[Pour le Mérite|Order of Merit]], and gave him a salary of 20,000 [[French livre]]s a year.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=218}} He had rooms at [[Sanssouci]] and [[Charlottenburg Palace]].{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=219}} Life went well for Voltaire at first,{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=217}} and in 1751 he completed ''[[Micromégas]]'', a piece of science fiction involving ambassadors from another planet witnessing the follies of humankind.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=220–21}} However, his relationship with Frederick the Great began to deteriorate after he was accused of theft and forgery by a Jewish financier, Abraham Hirschel, who had invested in Saxon government bonds on behalf of Voltaire at a time when Frederick was involved in sensitive diplomatic negotiations with [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]].{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=221–22}}

He encountered other difficulties: an argument with [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]], the president of the [[Berlin Academy of Science]] and a former rival for Émilie's affections, provoked Voltaire's ''[[Doctor Akakia|Diatribe du docteur Akakia]]'' ("Diatribe of Doctor Akakia"), which satirized some of Maupertuis's theories and his abuse of power in his persecutions of a mutual acquaintance, [[Johann Samuel König]]. This greatly angered Frederick, who ordered all copies of the document burned.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=225–229}} On 1 January 1752, Voltaire offered to resign as chamberlain and return his insignia of the Order of Merit; at first, Frederick refused until eventually permitting Voltaire to leave in March.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=229–230}} On a slow journey back to France, Voltaire stayed at [[Leipzig]] and [[Gotha]] for a month each, and [[Kassel]] for two weeks, arriving at [[Frankfurt]] on 31 May. The following morning, he was detained at the inn where he was staying by Frederick's agents, who held him in the city for over three weeks while they, Voltaire and Frederick argued by letter over the return of a satirical book of poetry Frederick had lent to Voltaire. Marie Louise joined him on 9 June. She and her uncle only left Frankfurt in July after she had defended herself from the unwanted advances of one of Frederick's agents and Voltaire's luggage had been ransacked and valuable items taken.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=232–35}}

Voltaire's attempts to vilify Frederick for his agents' actions at Frankfurt were largely unsuccessful. Voltaire responded by composing ''Mémoires pour Servir à la Vie de M. de Voltaire'', a work published after his death that paints a largely negative picture of his time spent with Frederick. However, the correspondence between them continued, and though they never met in person again, after the [[Seven Years' War]] they largely reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, Nancy (1970) ''Frederick the Great'' pp. 184–85, 269&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geneva and Ferney ===
[[File:Château de Voltaire à Ferney 3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Voltaire's ''[[château]]'' at [[Ferney]], France]]
Voltaire's slow progress toward Paris continued through [[Mainz]], [[Mannheim]], [[Strasbourg]], and [[Colmar]],{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=236–37}} but in January 1754 [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] banned him from Paris,{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=238}} so instead he turned for [[Geneva]], near which he bought a large estate (''[[Les Délices]]'') in early 1755.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=244–45}} Though he was received openly at first, the law in Geneva, which banned theatrical performances, and the publication of ''[[The Maid of Orleans (poem)|The Maid of Orleans]]'' against his will soured his relationship with Calvinist Genevans.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=247}} In late 1758, he bought an even larger estate at [[Ferney]], on the French side of the [[Franco-Swiss border]].{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=263–64}}

Early in 1759, Voltaire completed and published ''[[Candide|Candide, ou l'Optimisme]]'' (''Candide, or Optimism''). This satire on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s philosophy of optimistic determinism remains the work for which Voltaire is perhaps best known. He would stay in Ferney for most of the remaining 20 years of his life, frequently entertaining distinguished guests, such as [[James Boswell]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Giacomo Casanova]], and [[Edward Gibbon]].{{efn|The Scottish diarist [[James Boswell|Boswell]] recorded their conversations in 1764, which are published in ''Boswell and the Grand Tour''.}} In 1764, he published one of his best-known philosophical works, the ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', a series of articles mainly on Christian history and dogmas, a few of which were originally written in Berlin.&lt;ref name="The Life of Voltaire" /&gt;

From 1762, he began to champion unjustly persecuted people, the case of [[Huguenot]] merchant [[Jean Calas]] being the most celebrated.&lt;ref name="The Life of Voltaire" /&gt; Calas had been tortured to death in 1763, supposedly because he had murdered his eldest son for wanting to convert to Catholicism. His possessions were confiscated and his two daughters were taken from his widow and were forced into Catholic convents. Voltaire, seeing this as a clear case of religious persecution, managed to overturn the conviction in 1765.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=284–90}}

Voltaire was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] a little over a month before his death. On 4 April 1778, Voltaire attended ''[[Les Neuf Sœurs|la Loge des Neuf Sœurs]]'' in Paris, and became an [[Entered Apprentice]] Freemason. According to some sources, "Benjamin Franklin&amp;nbsp;... urged Voltaire to become a freemason; and Voltaire agreed, perhaps only to please Franklin."&lt;ref name="Ridley2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Ridley|title=The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society|url=https://books.google.com/?id=h7q3VIZCiwQC&amp;pg=PT141|year=2011|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|isbn=978-1-61145-010-1|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmason.com/didntARC.ihtml |title=I did not know that: Mason Facts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112071055/http://www.americanmason.com/didntARC.ihtml |archivedate=12 January 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/voltaire/voltaire.html |title=Voltaire on British Columbia Grand Lodge Site }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Benjamin Franklin was merely a visitor at the time Voltaire was initiated, the two only met a month before Voltaire's death, and their interactions with each other were brief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adrian|last=Young|date=19 July 2010|url=http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/publications/detail/exclusive-when-franklin-met-voltaire |title=When Franklin Met Voltaire |publisher=Family Security Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Voltaire-last-house.jpg|thumb|House in Paris where Voltaire died]]

=== Death and burial ===
In February 1778, Voltaire returned for the first time in over 25 years to Paris, among other reasons to see the opening of his latest tragedy, ''Irene''.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=364–65, 371–72}} The five-day journey was too much for the 83-year-old, and he believed he was about to die on 28 February, writing "I die adoring God, loving my friends, not hating my enemies, and detesting superstition." However, he recovered, and in March saw a performance of ''Irene'', where he was treated by the audience as a returning hero.&lt;ref name="The Life of Voltaire"/&gt;

He soon became ill again and died on 30 May 1778. The accounts of his deathbed have been numerous and varying, and it has not been possible to establish the details of what precisely occurred. His enemies related that he repented and accepted the last rites given by a Catholic priest, or that he died under great torment, while his adherents told how he was defiant to his last breath.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''The Enlightenment – An Interpretation, Volume 2: The Science of Freedom'', Wildwood House, London, 1973, pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one story of his last words, his response to a priest at his deathbed urging him to renounce Satan was "Now is not the time for making new enemies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teach What You Believe|last=Bulston|first=Michael E|year=2007|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=978-0-8091-4481-5|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qq4eY3IrT1kC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=voltaire+last+words+making+enemies#v=onepage&amp;q=voltaire%20last%20words%20making%20enemies&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this appears to have originated from a joke first published in a Massachusetts newspaper in 1856, and was only attributed to Voltaire in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/08/13/no-enemies/|title=Deathbed Remark: This Is No Time To Be Making New Enemies - Quote Investigator|website=quoteinvestigator.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his well-known criticism of the Church, which he had refused to retract before his death, Voltaire was denied a Christian burial in Paris,{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=386–87}} but friends and relations managed to bury his body secretly at the Abbey of Scellières in [[Champagne (region)|Champagne]], where Marie Louise's brother was ''[[abbé]]''.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=388–89}} His heart and brain were embalmed separately.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=388, 391}}

[[File:Tombeau et statue de Voltaire, Paris 8 juin 2014.jpg|thumb|Voltaire's tomb in the Paris [[Panthéon]]]]
Regarding Voltaire as a forerunner of the [[French Revolution]], the [[National Assembly of France]] had his remains brought back to Paris, and enshrined in the [[Panthéon]] on 11 July 1791.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=411–16}}{{efn|It was rumoured that in May 1814, his and Rousseau's bones were removed from the Panthéon and discarded on the outskirts of Paris by supporters of the [[Bourbon Restoration]]. Both tombs were opened in 1897, and the remains were still there.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|pp=416–17}} Nevertheless, some modern historians have published the rumor as fact.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=926}}}} It is estimated that a million people attended the procession, which stretched throughout Paris. There was an elaborate ceremony, complete with an orchestra, and the music included a piece that [[André Grétry]] had composed especially for the event, which included a part for the "tuba curva" (an instrument that originated in Roman times as the [[Cornu (horn)|cornu]] but had recently been revived under a new name).&lt;ref&gt;Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954; "Cornu" article&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
Voltaire had an enormous influence on the development of [[historiography]] through his demonstration of fresh new ways to look at the past. Guillaume de Syon argues:
{{quote|Voltaire recast historiography in both factual and analytical terms. Not only did he reject traditional biographies and accounts that claim the work of supernatural forces, but he went so far as to suggest that earlier historiography was rife with falsified evidence and required new investigations at the source. Such an outlook was not unique in that the scientific spirit that 18th-century intellectuals perceived themselves as invested with. A rationalistic approach was key to rewriting history.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume de Syon, "Voltaire," in {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd. ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&amp;pg=PA1270|year=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=1270–72|isbn=9781884964336}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Voltaire's best-known histories are ''[[History of Charles XII]]'' (1731), ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]'' (1751), and his ''[[Essai sur les mœurs et l'esprit des nations|Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations]]'' (1756). He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events, and emphasized customs, social history and achievements in the arts and sciences. The ''Essay on Customs'' traced the progress of world civilization in a universal context, thereby rejecting both nationalism and the traditional Christian frame of reference. Influenced by [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]]'s ''Discourse on the Universal History'' (1682), he was the first scholar to make a serious attempt to write the history of the world, eliminating theological frameworks, and emphasizing economics, culture and political history. He treated Europe as a whole, rather than a collection of nations. He was the first to emphasize the debt of medieval culture to Middle Eastern civilization, but otherwise was weak on the Middle Ages. Although he repeatedly warned against political bias on the part of the historian, he did not miss many opportunities to expose the intolerance and frauds of the church over the ages. Voltaire advised scholars that anything contradicting the normal course of nature was not to be believed. Although he found evil in the historical record, he fervently believed reason and educating the illiterate masses would lead to progress.

Voltaire explains his view of historiography in his article on "History" in Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'': "One demands of modern historians more details, better ascertained facts, precise dates, more attention to customs, laws, mores, commerce, finance, agriculture, population." Voltaire's histories imposed the values of the Enlightenment on the past, but at the same time he helped free historiography from antiquarianism, Eurocentrism, religious intolerance and a concentration on great men, diplomacy, and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sakmann, Paul |title=The Problems of Historical Method and of Philosophy of History in Voltaire|journal=History and Theory|volume= 11|issue=4 |year=1971|pages=24–59|jstor=2504245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Peter (1988) ''Voltaire's Politics''&lt;/ref&gt; Yale professor [[Peter Gay]] says Voltaire wrote "very good history", citing his "scrupulous concern for truths", "careful sifting of evidence", "intelligent selection of what is important", "keen sense of drama", and "grasp of the fact that a whole civilization is a unit of study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gay, Peter |title=Carl Becker's Heavenly City|journal=Political Science Quarterly|year=1957|volume=72|pages=182–99|jstor=2145772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poetry ===
From an early age, Voltaire displayed a talent for writing verse and his first published work was poetry. He wrote two book-long epic poems, including the first ever written in French, the ''[[Henriade]]'', and later, ''[[The Maid of Orleans (poem)|The Maid of Orleans]]'', besides many other smaller pieces.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The ''Henriade'' was written in imitation of [[Virgil]], using the [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]] couplet reformed and rendered monotonous for modern readers but it was a huge success in the 18th and early 19th century, with sixty-five editions and translations into several languages. The epic poem transformed French King Henry IV into a national hero for his attempts at instituting tolerance with his Edict of Nantes. [[The Maid of Orleans (poem)|''La Pucelle'']], on the other hand, is a [[burlesque]] on the legend of [[Joan of Arc]]. Voltaire's minor poems are generally considered superior to either of these two works.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Prose ===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
[[File:VoltaireCandidFrontis+Chap01-1762.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Frontispiece and first page of an early English translation by T. Smollett et al. of Voltaire's ''[[Candide]]'', 1762]]
Many of Voltaire's [[prose]] works and romances, usually composed as pamphlets, were written as [[polemics]]. ''[[Candide]]'' attacks the passivity inspired by Leibniz's philosophy of [[optimism]] through the character Pangloss's frequent refrain that circumstances are the "[[best of all possible worlds]]". ''L'Homme aux quarante ecus'' (''The Man of Forty Pieces of Silver''), addresses social and political ways of the time; ''[[Zadig]]'' and others, the received forms of moral and metaphysical orthodoxy; and some were written to deride the Bible. In these works, Voltaire's ironic style, free of exaggeration, is apparent, particularly the restraint and simplicity of the verbal treatment.{{sfn|Saintsbury|1911|p=204i}} ''Candide'' in particular is the best example of his style. Voltaire also has—in common with [[Jonathan Swift]]—the distinction of paving the way for science fiction's philosophical irony, particularly in his ''[[Micromégas]]'' and the vignette ''[[Plato's Dream]]'' (1756).

[[File:Voltaire-Baquoy.gif|thumb|Voltaire at [[Frederick the Great]]'s ''[[Sanssouci]]'', by [[Pierre Charles Baquoy]]]]
In general, his criticism and miscellaneous writing show a similar style to Voltaire's other works. Almost all of his more substantive works, whether in verse or prose, are preceded by prefaces of one sort or another, which are models of his caustic yet conversational tone. In a vast variety of nondescript pamphlets and writings, he displays his skills at journalism. In pure literary criticism his principal work is the ''[[Commentaires sur Corneille|Commentaire sur Corneille]]'', although he wrote many more similar works—sometimes (as in his ''Life and Notices of Molière'') independently and sometimes as part of his ''Siècles''.{{sfn|Saintsbury|1911|p=205}}

Voltaire's works, especially his private letters, frequently contain the word ''"l'infâme"'' and the expression ''"écrasez l'infâme"'', or "crush the infamous".&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, Joseph, ''A Treatise on Toleration and Other Essays'' (Amherst: Prometheus Books 1994) {{ISBN|0-87975-881-3}} pg. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase refers to abuses of the people by royalty and the clergy that Voltaire saw around him, and the superstition and intolerance that the clergy bred within the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=R.R.|author2=Colton, Joel|title=A History of the Modern World|year=1950|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc.|isbn=0-07-040826-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had felt these effects in his own exiles, the burnings of his books and those of many others, and in the hideous sufferings of [[Jean Calas]] and [[François-Jean de la Barre]].{{sfn|Saintsbury|1911|p=204}} He stated in one of his most famous quotes that "Superstition sets the whole world in flames; philosophy quenches them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Religious and Spiritual Quotations|author=Geoffrey Parrinder|publisher=Routledge|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most oft-cited Voltaire quotation is apocryphal. He is incorrectly credited with writing, "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it." These were not his words, but rather those of [[Evelyn Beatrice Hall]], written under the pseudonym S. G. Tallentyre in her 1906 biographical book ''[[The Friends of Voltaire]]''. Hall intended to summarize in her own words Voltaire's attitude towards [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]] and his controversial book ''De l'esprit'', but her first-person expression was mistaken for an actual quotation from Voltaire. Her interpretation does capture the spirit of Voltaire's attitude towards Helvetius; it had been said Hall's summary was inspired by a quotation found in a 1770 Voltaire letter to an Abbot le Riche, in which he was reported to have said, "I detest what you write, but I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boller, Jr. |first=Paul F. |author2=George, John |title=They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, and Misleading Attributions |year=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-505541-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, scholars believe there must have again been misinterpretation, as the letter does not seem to contain any such quote.{{efn|Charles Wirz, archivist at the Voltaire Institute and Museum in Geneva, recalled in 1994, that Hall 'wrongly' placed this quotation between speech marks in two of her works about Voltaire, recognising expressly the quotation in question was not one, in a letter of 9 May 1939, which was published in 1943 in volume LVIII under the title "Voltaire never said it" (pp. 534–35) of the review ''Modern language notes'', Johns Hopkins Press, 1943, Baltimore. An extract from the letter: 'The phrase "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it" which you have found in my book ''Voltaire in His Letters'' is my own expression and should not have been put in inverted commas. Please accept my apologies for having, quite unintentionally, misled you into thinking I was quoting a sentence used by Voltaire (or anyone else but myself).' The words "my own" were underlined personally by Hall in her letter. To believe certain commentators – Norbert Guterman, ''A Book of French Quotations'', 1963 – Hall was referencing back to a Voltaire letter of 6 February 1770 to an abbot le Riche where Voltaire supposedly said, "Reverend, I hate what you write, but I will give my life so that you can continue to write." The problem is that, if you consult the letter itself, the sentence there does not appear, nor even the idea: "A M LE RICHE A AMIENS. 6 February. You left, Sir, des Welches for des Welches. You will find everywhere barbarians obstinate. The number of wise will always be small. It is true … it has increased; but it is nothing in comparison with the stupid ones; and, by misfortune, one says that God is always for the big battalions. It is necessary that the decent people stick together and stay under cover. There are no means that their small troop could tackle the party of the fanatics in open country. I was very sick, I was near death every winter; this is the reason, Sir, why I have answered you so late. I am not less touched by it than your memory. Continue to me your friendship; it comforts me my evils and stupidities of the human genre. Receive my assurances, etc." Voltaire, however, did not hesitate to wish censure against slander and personal libels. Here is what he writes in his "Atheism" article in the ''Dictionnaire philosophique'': "Aristophanes (this man that the commentators admire because he was Greek, not thinking that Socrates was Greek also), Aristophanes was the first who accustomed the Athenians to consider Socrates an atheist. … The tanners, the shoemakers and the dressmakers of Athens applauded a joke in which one represented Socrates raised in the air in a basket, announcing there was God, and praising himself to have stolen a coat by teaching philosophy. A whole people, whose bad government authorized such infamous licences, deserved well what it got, to become the slave of the Romans, and today of the Turks."}}

Voltaire's first major philosophical work in his battle against ''"l'infâme"'' was the ''Traité sur la tolérance'' (''[[Treatise on Tolerance]]''), exposing the Calas affair, along with the tolerance exercised by other faiths and in other eras (for example, by the Jews, the Romans, the Greeks and the Chinese). Then, in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', containing such articles as "Abraham", "Genesis", "Church Council", he wrote about what he perceived as the human origins of dogmas and beliefs, as well as inhuman behavior of religious and political institutions in shedding blood over the quarrels of competing sects. Amongst other targets, Voltaire criticized France's colonial policy in North America, dismissing the vast territory of [[New France]] as "[[a few acres of snow]]" (''"quelques arpents de neige"'').

=== Letters ===
Voltaire also engaged in an enormous amount of private correspondence during his life, totalling over 20,000 letters. [[Theodore Besterman]]'s collected edition of these letters, completed only in 1964, fills 102 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brumfitt|first=J. H.|year=1965|title=The Present State of Voltaire Studies|journal=Forum for Modern Language Studies|volume=I|issue=3|page=230|publisher=Court of the University of St Andrews |doi=10.1093/fmls/I.3.230|url=http://fmls.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/I/3/230|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One historian called the letters "a feast not only of wit and eloquence but of warm friendship, humane feeling, and incisive thought."{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=138}}

In Voltaire's correspondence with [[Catherine the Great]] he derided democracy. He wrote, "Almost nothing great has ever been done in the world except by the genius and firmness of a single man combating the prejudices of the multitude."&lt;ref&gt;Massie, Robert K. (2011). Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman. New York: Random House. p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious views ==
{{Criticism of religion sidebar}}
[[File:Voltaire dictionary.jpg|thumb|upright|Voltaire at 70; engraving from 1843 edition of his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique|Philosophical Dictionary]]'']]
Like other key [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, Voltaire was a [[Deism|deist]], expressing the idea: "What is faith? Is it to believe that which is evident? No. It is perfectly evident to my mind that there exists a necessary, eternal, supreme, and intelligent being. This is no matter of faith, but of reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deism.com/voltaire.htm|title=Voltaire|publisher=Deism.com|date=25 June 2009|accessdate=3 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608153319/http://www.deism.com/voltaire.htm|archivedate=8 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire. W. Dugdale, ''A Philosophical Dictionary ver 2'', 1843, p. 473 sec 1. Retrieved 31 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire held mixed views of the [[Abrahamic religions]] but had a favourable view of [[Hinduism]].

In a 1763 essay, Voltaire supported the [[Religious toleration|toleration]] of other religions and ethnicities: "It does not require great art, or magnificently trained eloquence, to prove that Christians should tolerate each other. I, however, am going further: I say that we should regard all men as our brothers. What? The Turk my brother? The Chinaman my brother? The Jew? The Siam? Yes, without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God?"&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire (1763) [https://web.archive.org/web/20060107013835/http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_2/voltaire.html ''A Treatise on Toleration'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his many denunciations of priests of every religious sect, Voltaire describes them as those who "rise from an incestuous bed, manufacture a hundred versions of God, then eat and drink God, then piss and shit God."&lt;ref name="Ruthven"/&gt;

=== Christianity ===
In a letter to [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], [[King of Prussia]], dated 5 January 1767, he wrote about [[Christianity]]: 
{{quote|''La nôtre [religion] est sans contredit la plus ridicule, la plus absurde, et la plus sanguinaire qui ait jamais infecté le monde.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9MWAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA184|title=Oeuvres complètes de Voltaire, Volume 7|page=184|year=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Our [religion] is assuredly the most ridiculous, the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected this world. Your Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by extirpating this infamous superstition, I do not say among the rabble, who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke; I say among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to think. … My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble enterprise, the finest and most respectable which the human mind can point out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Satanism: Anatomy of a Radical Subculture|first=Chris|last=Mathews|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2009|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Faith, Rationality and the Passions|page=37|year=2012|first=Sarah|last=Coakley}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''La bible enfin expliquée'', he expressed the following attitude to lay reading of the Bible: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is characteristic of fanatics who read the holy scriptures to tell themselves: God killed, so I must kill; Abraham lied, Jacob deceived, Rachel stole: so I must steal, deceive, lie. But, wretch, you are neither Rachel, nor Jacob, nor Abraham, nor God; you are just a mad fool, and the popes who forbade the reading of the Bible were extremely wise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Voltaire|first=Nicholas|last=Cronk|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Voltaire's opinion of the Christian [[Bible]] was mixed. Although influenced by [[Socinian]] works such as the [[Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum]], Voltaire's skeptical attitude to the Bible separated him from Unitarian theologians like [[Fausto Sozzini]] or even Biblical-political writers like [[John Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Florida ''Voltaire and the Socinians'' 1974 "Voltaire from his very first writings on the subject of religion showed a libertine scorn of scripture, which he never lost. This set him apart from Socinianism even though he admired the simplicity of Socinian theology as well as their ...".&lt;/ref&gt; His statements on religion also brought down on him the fury of the Jesuits and in particular [[Claude-Adrien Nonnotte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Retirement Series: Volume 7: 28 November 1813 to 30 September 1814: Volume 7: 28 November 1813 to 30 September 1814|page=27|publisher=Princeton University Press}}edited by J. Jefferson Looney&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Les chrétiens n'avaient regardé jusqu'à présent le fameux Mahomet que comme un heureux brigand, un imposteur habile, un législateur presque toujours extravagant. Quelques Savants de ce siècle, sur la foi des rapsodies arabesques, ont entrepris de le venger de l'injustice que lui font nos écrivains. Ils nous le donnent comme un génie sublime, et comme un homme des plus admirables, par la grandeur de ses entreprises, de ses vue, de ses succès'', [[Claude-Adrien Nonnotte]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Les erreurs de Voltaire'', Jacquenod père et Rusand, 1770, Vol I, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''M. de Voltaire nous assure qu'il [Mahomet] avait une éloquence vive et forte, des yeux perçants, une physionomie heureuse, l'intrépidité d'Alexandre, la libéralité et la sobriété dont Alexandre aurait eu besoin pour être un grand homme en tout … Il nous représente Mahomet comme un homme qui a eu la gloire de tirer presque toute l'Asie des ténèbres de l'idolâtrie. Il extrait quelques paroles de divers endroits de l'Alcoran, dont il admire le Sublime. Il trouve que sa loi est extrêmement sage, que ses lois civiles sont bonnes et que son dogme est admirable en ce qu'il se conforme avec le nôtre. Enfin pour prémunir les lecteurs contre tout ce que les Chrétiens ont dit méchamment de Mahomet, il avertit que ce ne sont guère que des sottises débitées par des moines ignorants et insensés.'', Nonnotte, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; This did not hinder his religious practice, though it did win for him a bad reputation in certain religious circles. The deeply Christian [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] wrote to his father the year of Voltaire's death, saying, "The arch-scoundrel Voltaire has finally kicked the bucket ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keffe|first=Simon P.|title=The Cambridge Companion to Mozart|series=[[Cambridge Companions to Music]]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-521-00192-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire was later deemed to influence [[Edward Gibbon]] in claiming that Christianity was a contributor to the fall of the Roman Empire in his book ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;As Christianity advances, disasters befall the [Roman] empire—arts, science, literature, decay—barbarism and all its revolting concomitants are made to seem the consequences of its decisive triumph—and the unwary reader is conducted, with matchless dexterity, to the desired conclusion—the abominable Manicheism of ''Candide'', and, in fact, of all the productions of Voltaire's historic school—viz., "that instead of being a merciful, ameliorating, and benignant visitation, the religion of Christians would rather seem to be a scourge sent on man by the author of all evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Dublin Review (Catholic periodical)|The Dublin Review: Vol. VIII]]|title=Gibbon; or, the Infidel Historian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JItKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA208|year=1840|publisher=Burns, Oates and Washbourne|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Voltaire also acknowledged the self-sacrifice of Christians. He wrote: "Perhaps there is nothing greater on earth than the sacrifice of youth and beauty, often of high birth, made by the gentle sex in order to work in hospitals for the relief of human misery, the sight of which is so revolting to our delicacy. Peoples separated from the Roman religion have imitated but imperfectly so generous a charity."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Woods, ''How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization'' (Regnery Publishing 2005) pp. 169–70&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, according to [[Daniel-Rops]], Voltaire's "hatred of religion increased with the passage of years. The attack, launched at first against clericalism and theocracy, ended in a furious assault upon Holy Scripture, the dogmas of the Church, and even upon the person of Jesus Christ Himself, who [he] depicted now as a degenerate".&lt;ref name="Daniel-Rops1964"&gt;{{cite book|last=Daniel-Rops|first=Henri|authorlink=Daniel-Rops|title=History of the Church of Christ|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P5gsAQAAMAAJ|year=1964|publisher=Dutton|page=47|quote=His hatred of religion increased with the passage of years. The attack, launched at first against clericalism and theocracy, ended in a furious assault upon Holy Scripture, the dogmas of the Church, and even upon the person of Jesus Christ Himself, who was depicted now as a degenerate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire's reasoning may be summed up in his well-known saying, "[[q:Voltaire|Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities]]".

=== Judaism ===
According to Orthodox rabbi [[Joseph Telushkin]], the most significant Enlightenment hostility against [[Judaism]] was found in Voltaire;&lt;ref name="Why?"&gt;[[Dennis Prager|Prager, D]]; [[Joseph Telushkin|Telushkin, J]]. ''Why the Jews?: The Reason for Antisemitism''. New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1983. pp. 128–89.&lt;/ref&gt; thirty of the 118 articles in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'' dealt with Jews and described them in consistently negative ways.&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Poliakov|Poliakov, L]]. ''The History of Anti-Semitism: From Voltaire to Wagner''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, Ltd., 1975 (translated). pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Voltaire|first=François-Marie|title=Essai sur les Moeurs}} See also: {{cite book|last=Voltaire|first=François-Marie|title=Dictionnaire Philosophique}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Voltaire's ''A Philosophical Dictionary'', he wrote of Jews: "In short, we find in them only an ignorant and barbarous people, who have long united the most sordid avarice with the most detestable superstition and the most invincible hatred for every people by whom they are tolerated and enriched."&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire. 1843. ''A Philosophical Dictionary'' page 94&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Peter Gay]], a contemporary authority on the Enlightenment,&lt;ref name="Why?" /&gt; also points to Voltaire's remarks (for instance, that the Jews were more tolerant than the Christians) in the ''Traité sur la tolérance'' and surmises that "Voltaire struck at the Jews to strike at Christianity". Whatever anti-semitism Voltaire may have felt, Gay suggests, derived from negative personal experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Gay|Gay, P]]. ''The Party of Humanity: Essays in the French Enlightenment''. Alfred Knopf, 1964. pp. 103–05.&lt;/ref&gt; Bertram Schwarzbach's far more detailed studies of Voltaire's dealings with Jewish people throughout his life concluded that he was anti-biblical, not anti-semitic. His remarks on the Jews and their "superstitions" were essentially no different from his remarks on Christians.&lt;ref&gt;(Schwarzbach, Bertram), "Voltaire et les juifs: bilan et plaidoyer", Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century (SVEC) 358, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

Telushkin states that Voltaire did not limit his attack to aspects of Judaism that Christianity used as a foundation, repeatedly making it clear that he despised Jews.&lt;ref name="Why?"/&gt; [[Arthur Hertzberg]] claims that Gay's second suggestion is also untenable, as Voltaire himself denied its validity when he remarked that he had "forgotten about much larger bankruptcies through Christians".{{clarify|date=June 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Hertzberg|Hertzberg, A]]. ''The French Enlightenment and the Jews''. Columbia University, 1968. p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors link Voltaire's [[anti-Judaism]] to his [[polygenism]]. According to [[Joxe Azurmendi]] this anti-Judaism has a relative importance in Voltaire's philosophy of history. However, Voltaire's anti-Judaism influences later authors like [[Ernest Renan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]] (2014). ''Historia, arraza, nazioa''. Donostia: Elkar. pp. 177–86. {{ISBN|978-84-9027-297-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the historian [[Will Durant]], Voltaire had initially condemned the persecution of Jews on several occasions including in his work ''Henriade''.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=629}} As stated by Durant, Voltaire had praised the simplicity, sobriety, regularity, and industry of Jews. However, subsequently, Voltaire had become strongly anti-Semitic after some regrettable personal financial transactions and quarrels with Jewish financiers. In his ''[[Essai sur les mœurs et l'esprit des nations|Essai sur les moeurs]]'' Voltaire had denounced the ancient Hebrews using strong language; a Catholic priest had protested against this censure. The anti-Semitic passages in Voltaire's ''Dictionnaire philosophique'' were criticized by [[Isaac de Pinto|Issac Pinto]] in 1762. Subsequently, Voltaire agreed with the criticism of his anti-Semitic views and stated that he had been "wrong to attribute to a whole nation the vices of some individuals";{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=630}} he also promised to revise the objectionable passages for forthcoming editions of the ''Dictionnaire philosophique'', but failed to do so.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=630}}

=== Islam ===
Voltaire's views about Islam remained negative as he considered the [[Qur'an]] to be ignorant of the laws of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Images of Islam in 18th Century Writings|year=1996|first=Ahmad|last=Gunny|quote=However, Islam still remains a false religion in Voltaire's eyes—he claims that the Quran betrays ignorance of the most elementary laws of physics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1740 letter to [[Frederick II of Prussia]], Voltaire ascribes to [[Muhammad]] a brutality that "is assuredly nothing any man can excuse" and suggests that his following stemmed from [[superstition]]. Referring to the prophet, Voltaire continued in his letter, "But that a camel-merchant should stir up insurrection in his village; that in league with some miserable followers he persuades them that he talks with the angel Gabriel; that he boasts of having been carried to heaven, where he received in part this unintelligible book, each page of which makes common sense shudder; that, to pay homage to this book, he delivers his country to iron and flame; that he cuts the throats of fathers and kidnaps daughters; that he gives to the defeated the choice of his religion or death: this is assuredly nothing any man can excuse, at least if he was not born a Turk, or if superstition has not extinguished all natural light in him."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Frederick II of Prussia (December 1740), published in ''[https://archive.org/details/oeuvrescomplete09voltgoog Oeuvres complètes de Voltaire]'', Vol. 7 (1869), edited by Georges Avenel, p.&amp;nbsp;105&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1748, after having read [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]] and [[George Sale]],&lt;ref&gt;Pomeau. Voltaire en son temps.&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote again about Mohammed and Islam in an article, "De l'Alcoran et de Mahomet" (On the Quran and on Mohammed). In the article, Voltaire maintained that Mohammed was a "sublime charlatan"{{efn|Written and published in 1748 in Volume IV of the Œuvres de Voltaire, following his Tragedy of Mahomet.}} Drawing also on complementary information in the "Oriental Library" of [[Barthélemy d'Herbelot de Molainville|Herbelot]], Voltaire, according to [[René Pomeau]], had a judgement of the Qur'an where he found the book in spite of "the contradictions, the absurdities, the anachronisms", "rhapsody, without connection, without order, and without art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Arabesque: The Oriental Mode in Eighteenth-century English Literature|first=Hussain|last=Fareed Ali Haddawy|year=1962|publisher=Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Planets and People, Volume 5, Issue 1|page=184|first=F.E.|last=Ormsby|year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Works of Voltaire: A philosophical dictionary|page=101|year=1901|author1=Smollett, Tobias|author2=Morley, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pomeau&gt;[[René Pomeau|Pomeau, René]] (1995) ''La religion de Voltaire''. A.G Nizet. {{ISBN|2707803316}}. p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus he "henceforward conceded" &lt;ref name="Pomeau"/&gt; that "if his book was bad for our times and for us, it was very good for his contemporaries, and his religion even more so. It must be admitted that he removed almost all of Asia from idolatry" and that "it was difficult for such a simple and wise religion, taught by a man who was constantly victorious, could hardly fail to subjugate a portion of the earth." He considered that "its civil laws are good; its dogma is admirable which it has in common with ours" but that "his means are shocking; deception and murder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Works of Voltaire: A philosophical dictionary|pages=102–104|year=1901|author1=Smollett, Tobias|author2=Morley, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Essai sur les mœurs et l'esprit des nations|Essay on the Manners and Spirit of Nations]]'' (published 1756), Voltaire deals with the history of Europe before Charlemagne to the dawn of the age of Louis XIV, and that of the colonies and the East.

==== Drama ''Mahomet'' ====
{{main|Mahomet (play)}}
The tragedy ''Fanaticism, or Mahomet the Prophet'' ({{lang-fr|Le fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Prophete}}) was written in 1736 by Voltaire. The play is a study of [[religious fanaticism]] and self-serving [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]]. The character Muhammad orders the murder of his critics.&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire, ''Mahomet the Prophet or Fanaticism: A Tragedy in Five Acts'', trans. Robert L. Myers, (New York: Frederick Ungar, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire described the play as "written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect."&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire ''Letter to Benedict XIV'' written in Paris on 17 August 1745: "Your holiness will pardon the liberty taken by one of the lowest of the faithful, though a zealous admirer of virtue, of submitting to the head of the true religion this performance, written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect. To whom could I with more propriety inscribe a satire on the cruelty and errors of a false prophet, than to the vicar and representative of a God of truth and mercy? Your holiness will therefore give me leave to lay at your feet both the piece and the author of it, and humbly to request your protection of the one, and your benediction upon the other; in hopes of which, with the profoundest reverence, I kiss your sacred feet."&lt;/ref&gt;

Voltaire described Muhammad as an "impostor", a "false prophet", a "fanatic" and a "hypocrite".&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire, ''Le Fanatisme ou Mahomet le prophète (1741)'', Œuvres complètes. Garnier, 1875, Vol.4, p135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mahomet le fanatique, le cruel, le fourbe, et, à la honte des hommes, le grand, qui de garçon marchand devient prophète, législateur et monarque'', (Mohammed the fanatic, the cruel, the deceiver, and to men's shame, the great, who from a grocer's boy became a prophet, a legislator and a monarch). Recueil des Lettres de Voltaire (1739–1741), Voltaire, Sanson et Compagnie, 1792, Lettre à M. De Cideville, conseiller honoraire du parlement (5 mai 1740), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Defending the play, Voltaire said that he "tried to show in it into what horrible excesses fanaticism, led by an impostor, can plunge weak minds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Voltaire in His Letters: Being a Selection from His Correspondence|page=74}} translated and edited by [[Evelyn Beatrice Hall]]&lt;/ref&gt; When Voltaire wrote in 1742 to [[César de Missy]], he described Mohammed as deceitful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Images of Islam in 18th Century Writings|year=1996|first=Ahmad|last=Gunny|quote=He expanded on this idea in his letter to César de Missy (Ist September 1742) where he described Mahomet as a deceitful character.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire, ''Lettres inédites de Voltaire'', Didier, 1856, Vol 1, Letter to César De Missy, 1 September 1743, p. 450.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his play, Mohammed was "whatever trickery can invent that is most atrocious and whatever fanaticism can accomplish that is most horrifying. Mahomet here is nothing other than [[Tartuffe]] with armies at his command."&lt;ref&gt;"The Atheist's Bible", p. 198, by Georges Minois, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Je sais que Mahomet n'a pas tramé précisément l'espèce de trahison qui fait le sujet de cette tragédie ... Je n'ai pas prétendu mettre seulement une action vraie sur la scène, mais des mœurs vraies, faire penser les hommes comme ils pensent dans les circonstances où ils se trouvent, et représenter enfin ce que la fourberie peut inventer de plus atroce, et ce que le Fanatisme peut exécuter de plus horrible. Mahomet n'est ici autre chose que Tartuffe les armes à la main. Je me croirai bien récompensé de mon travail, si quelqu'une de ces âmes faibles, toujours prêtes à recevoir les impressions d'une fureur étrangère qui n'est pas au fond de leur cœur, peut s'affermir contre ces funestes séductions par la lecture de cet ouvrage.'', Voltaire, Letter to Frederick II, King of Prussia, 20 January 1742.&lt;/ref&gt; After later having judged that he had made Mohammed in his play "somewhat nastier than he really was",&lt;ref&gt;''Il n'appartenait assurément qu'aux musulmans de se plaindre ; car j'ai fait Mahomet un peu plus méchant qu'il n'était'', Lettre à Mme Denis, 29 October 1751, ''Lettres choisies de Voltaire'', Libraires associés, 1792, Vol. 2, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire claims that Muhammad stole the idea of an angel weighing both men and women from Zoroastrians, who are often referred to as "[[Magi]]". Voltaire continues about Islam, saying:
{{quote|Nothing is more terrible than a people who, having nothing to lose, fight in the united spirit of rapine and of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Works of Voltaire: A philosophical dictionary|page=105|year=1905|author1=Smollett, Tobias|author2=Morley, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 1745 letter recommending the play to [[Pope Benedict XIV]], Voltaire described Muhammad as "the founder of a false and barbarous sect" and "a false prophet". Voltaire wrote: "Your holiness will pardon the liberty taken by one of the lowest of the faithful, though a zealous admirer of virtue, of submitting to the head of the true religion this performance, written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect. To whom could I with more propriety inscribe a satire on the cruelty and errors of a false prophet, than to the vicar and representative of a God of truth and mercy?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Works of Voltaire: The dramatic works of Voltaire|year=1901|publisher=St. Hubert Guild|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire, Letter to Benedict XIV written in Paris on 17 August 1745: ''Your holiness will pardon the liberty taken by one of the lowest of the faithful, though a zealous admirer of virtue, of submitting to the head of the true religion this performance, written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect.

=== Hinduism ===
Commenting on the sacred texts of the Hindus, the [[Vedas]], Voltaire observed: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Veda was the most precious gift for which the West had ever been indebted to the East.&lt;ref&gt;"Lectures on the science of language, delivered at the Royal institution of Great Britain in 1861 [and 1863]", by [[Max Muller]], p. 148, originally from Oxford University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He regarded Hindus as "a peaceful and innocent people, equally incapable of hurting others or of defending themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Modern Review (Calcutta)|The Modern Review]]|title=Review and Notices of Books: Hindu Culture|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b2868077;view=1up;seq=199|editor-last=Chatterjee|editor-first=Ramananda|editorlink=Ramananda Chatterjee|volume=32|year=1922|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire was himself a supporter of [[animal rights]] and was a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]].&lt;ref&gt;''Pensées végétariennes'', Voltaire, éditions Mille et une nuits.&lt;/ref&gt; He used the antiquity of Hinduism to land what he saw as a devastating blow to the Bible's claims and acknowledged that the Hindus' treatment of animals showed a shaming alternative to the immorality of European imperialists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/21/extract Guardian (UK) newspaper, review of ''Bloodless Revolution'', published by Harper-Collins]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views on race and slavery ==
Voltaire rejected the biblical [[Adam and Eve]] story and was a [[Polygenism|polygenist]] who speculated that each race had entirely separate origins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Sala-Molins|Sala-Molins, Louis]] (2006) ''Dark side of the light: slavery and the French Enlightenment''. Univ Of Minnesota Press. {{ISBN|0-8166-4389-X}}. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=de Viguerie, Jean|title=Les 'Lumieres' et les peuples|journal=Revue Historique|date=July 1993|volume=290|issue =1|pages=161–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Cohen, like most other polygenists, Voltaire believed that because of their different origins blacks did not entirely share the natural humanity of whites.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2003 86"&gt;{{cite book|title=The French encounter with Africans: White response to Blacks, 1530–1880|author=William B. Cohen|publisher=Indiana University Press|page=86|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Allen Harvey, Voltaire often invoked racial differences as a means to attack religious orthodoxy, and the Biblical account of creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The French Enlightenment and its Others:The Mandarin, the Savage, and the Invention of the Human Sciences|author=David Allen Harvey|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=135–46|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most famous remark on slavery is found in ''Candide'', where the hero is horrified to learn "at what price we eat sugar in Europe" after coming across a slave in [[French Guiana]] who has been mutilated for escaping, who opines that, if all human beings have common origins as the Bible taught, it makes them cousins, concluding that "no one could treat their relatives more horribly". Elsewhere, he wrote caustically about "whites and Christians [who] proceed to purchase negroes cheaply, in order to sell them dear in America". Voltaire has been accused of supporting the slave trade as per a letter attributed to him,&lt;ref&gt;Davis, David Brion, ''The problem of slavery in Western culture'' (New York: Oxford University Press 1988) {{ISBN|0-19-505639-6}} p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney, For the Glory of God: How Monotheism Led to Reformations, ''Science'', Witch-Hunts, and the End of Slavery (2003), p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Christopher L., The French Atlantic triangle: literature and culture of the slave trade (2008) pp. x, 7, 73, 77&lt;/ref&gt; although it has been suggested that this letter is a forgery "since no satisfying source attests to the letter's existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Claims to Memory: Beyond Slavery and Emancipation in the French Caribbean|author=Catherine A.

In his ''Philosophical Dictionary'', Voltaire endorses [[Montesquieu]]'s criticism of the slave trade: "Montesquieu was almost always in error with the learned, because he was not learned, but he was almost always right against the fanatics and the promoters of slavery."{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1980|p=358}}

[[Zeev Sternhell]] argues that despite his shortcomings, Voltaire was a forerunner of liberal [[wikt:pluralism|pluralism]] in his approach to history and non-European cultures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sternhell |first1=Zeev |title=The Anti-Enlightenment Tradition |date=2010 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire wrote, "We have slandered the Chinese because their metaphysics is not the same as ours&amp;nbsp;... This great misunderstanding about Chinese rituals has come about because we have judged their usages by ours, for we carry the prejudices of our contentious spirit to the end of the world."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In speaking of Persia, he condemned Europe's "ignorant audacity" and "ignorant credulity". When writing about India, he declares, "It is time for us to give up the shameful habit of slandering all sects and insulting all nations!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In ''Essai sur les mœurs et l'esprit des nations'', he defended the integrity of the Native Americans and wrote favorably of the Inca Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sternhell |first1=Zeev |title=The Anti-Enlightenment Tradition |date=2010 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appreciation and influence ==
According to [[Victor Hugo]]: "To name Voltaire is to characterize the entire eighteenth century."&lt;ref name="Will Durant 1933 259"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Philosophy 2nd ed.|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page=259|year=1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Goethe]] regarded Voltaire to be the greatest literary figure in modern times, and possibly of all times.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=881}} According to [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], Voltaire's influence on posterity would extend far into the future.&lt;ref name ="Besterman 1969 11"&gt;{{cite book|title=Voltaire|author=Theodore Besterman|publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc|page=11|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--START OF NOTE--&gt;{{efn|Diderot, in a letter to E.M.

In Russia, [[Catherine the Great]] had been reading Voltaire for sixteen years prior to becoming Empress in 1762.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=139}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. 2012|url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/people/catherine-ii-rise-to-power.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1763, she began a correspondence with the philosopher that continued till his death.

In his native Paris, Voltaire was viewed as the defender of [[Jean Calas]] and [[Pierre-Paul Sirven|Pierre Sirven]].{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=881}} Although he failed in securing the annulment of [[François-Jean de la Barre|la Barre]]'s execution for "blasphemies" against Christianity, despite a protracted campaign, the criminal code that sanctioned the execution was revised during Voltaire's lifetime.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1980|pp=734–36}} In 1764, Voltaire successfully intervened and secured the release of Claude Chamont for the crime of attending [[Protestant]] services. When [[Thomas Arthur, comte de Lally|Comte de Lally]] was executed for treason in 1766, Voltaire wrote a 300-page document absolving de Lally. Subsequently, in 1778, the judgment against de Lally was expunged just before Voltaire's death. The Genevan Protestant minister Pomaret once said to Voltaire, "You seem to attack Christianity, and yet you do the work of a Christian."{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1980|p=736}} [[Frederick the Great]] noted the significance of a philosopher capable of influencing judges to change their unjust decisions, commenting that this alone is sufficient to ensure the prominence of Voltaire as a humanitarian.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1980|p=736}}

Under the [[French Third Republic]], anarchists and socialists often invoked Voltaire's writings in their struggles against militarism, nationalism, and the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKinley |first1=C.

== Voltaire and Rousseau ==
Voltaire's junior contemporary [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] commented on how Voltaire's book ''[[Letters on the English]]'' played a great role in his intellectual development.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1980|p=370}} Having written some literary works and also some music, in December 1745 Rousseau wrote a letter introducing himself to Voltaire, who was by then the most prominent literary figure in France, to which Voltaire replied with a polite response. Subsequently, when Rousseau sent Voltaire a copy of his book ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'', Voltaire replied, noting his disagreement with the views expressed in the book:
{{Quote|No one has ever employed so much intellect to persuade men to be beasts. In reading your work one is seized with a desire to walk on four paws [''marcher à quatre pattes'']. However, as it is more than sixty years since I lost that habit, I feel, unfortunately, that it is impossible for me to resume it.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=31}}}}

Subsequently, commenting on Rousseau's romantic novel ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'', Voltaire stated: 
{{quote|No more about Jean-Jacques' romance if you please. I have read it, to my sorrow, and it would be to his if I had time to say what I think of this silly book.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=170}}}}

Voltaire speculated that the first half of ''Julie'' had been written in a brothel and the second half in a lunatic asylum.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=149}} In his ''Lettres sur La Nouvelle Heloise'', written under a pseudonym, Voltaire offered criticism highlighting grammatical mistakes in the book: 
{{quote|Paris recognized Voltaire's hand and judged the patriarch to be bitten by jealousy.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=170}}}}

In reviewing Rousseau's book ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]'' after its publication, Voltaire dismissed it as "a hodgepodge of a silly wet nurse in four volumes, with forty pages against Christianity, among the boldest ever known." He expressed admiration for the section in this book titled ''Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar'', calling it "fifty good pages...it is regrettable that they should have been written by...such a knave."{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|pp=190–91}} He went on to predict that ''Emile'' would be forgotten after a month.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=149}}

In 1764, Rousseau published ''Lettres de la montagne'', containing nine letters on religion and politics. In the fifth letter he wondered why Voltaire had not been able to imbue the Genevan councilors, who frequently met him, "with that spirit of tolerance which he preaches without cease, and of which he sometimes has need". The letter continued with an imaginary speech delivered by Voltaire, imitating his literary style, in which he accepts authorship for the book ''Sermon of the Fifty''—a book whose authorship Voltaire had repeatedly denied because it contained many heresies.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|pp=197–99}}

In 1772, when a priest sent Rousseau a pamphlet denouncing Voltaire, Rousseau responded with a defense of Voltaire: 
{{quote|He has said and done so many good things that we should draw the curtain over his irregularities.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|pp=197–99}}}}

In 1778, when Voltaire was given unprecedented honors at the [[Comédie-Française|Théâtre-Français]],{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|pp=877–78}} an acquaintance of Rousseau ridiculed the event. This was met by a sharp retort from Rousseau: 
{{quote|How dare you mock the honors rendered to Voltaire in the temple of which he is the god, and by the priests who for fifty years have been living off his masterpieces?{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=886}}}}

On 2 July 1778, Rousseau died one month after Voltaire's death.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|pp=879, 886}} In October 1794, Rousseau's remains were moved to the [[Panthéon]], where they were placed near the remains of Voltaire.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=887}}&lt;!--START OF NOTE--&gt;{{efn|"From that haven of neighborly peace their spirits rose to renew their war for the soul of the Revolution, of France, and of Western man," writes Will Durant.{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1967|p=887}}&lt;!--END OF NOTE--&gt;}}

The complex soul of France seemed to have divided itself into these two men, so different and yet so French. [[Nietzsche]] speaks of "''la gaya scienza'', the light feet, wit, fire, grace, strong logic, arrogant intellectuality, the dance of the stars"—surely he was thinking of Voltaire. Now beside Voltaire put Rousseau:all heat and fantasy, a man with noble and jejune visions, the idol of ''la bourgeois gentile-femme'', announcing like Pascal that the heart has its reason which the head can never understand.&lt;ref name="Durant 1933 187"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Philosophy 2nd ed.|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page=187|year=1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!--END OF NOTE--&gt;}}

[[File:Voltaire by Jean-Antoine Houdon (1778).jpg|thumb|Voltaire, by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], 1778 ([[National Gallery of Art]])]]
Voltaire perceived the French [[bourgeoisie]] to be too small and ineffective, the [[aristocracy]] to be parasitic and corrupt, the commoners as ignorant and superstitious, and the [[Catholic Church|Church]] as a static and oppressive force useful only on occasion as a counterbalance to the rapacity of kings, although all too often, even more rapacious itself. Voltaire distrusted democracy, which he saw as propagating the idiocy of the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/voltaire/voldemoc.html|title=The Philosophical Dictionary|accessdate=1 July 2008|chapter=Democracy|publisher=Knopf|year=1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire long thought only an enlightened monarch could bring about change, given the social structures of the time and the extremely high rates of illiteracy, and that it was in the king's rational interest to improve the education and welfare of his subjects. But his disappointments and disillusions with [[Frederick the Great]] changed his philosophy somewhat, and soon gave birth to one of his most enduring works, his novella ''[[Candide, ou l'Optimisme]]'' (''Candide, or Optimism,'' 1759), which ends with a new conclusion: "It is up to us to cultivate our garden." His most polemical and ferocious attacks on intolerance and religious persecutions indeed began to appear a few years later. ''Candide'' was also burned and Voltaire jokingly claimed the actual author was a certain 'Demad' in a letter, where he reaffirmed the main polemical stances of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/homes/VSA/Candide/Candide.letter.html|title=Letter on the subject of Candide, to the Journal encyclopédique July 15, 1759|accessdate=7 January 2008|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013194545/http://humanities.uchicago.edu/homes/VSA/Candide/Candide.letter.html|archivedate=13 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is remembered and honored in France as a courageous polemicist who indefatigably fought for [[civil rights]] (as the [[right to a fair trial]] and [[freedom of religion]]) and who denounced the hypocrisies and injustices of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''. The ''Ancien Régime'' involved an unfair balance of power and taxes between the three [[Estates General (France)|Estates]]: clergy and nobles on one side, the commoners and middle class, who were burdened with most of the taxes, on the other. He particularly had admiration for the ethics and government as exemplified by the [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosopher]] [[Confucius]].&lt;ref name=liu53/&gt;

Voltaire is also known for many memorable aphorisms, such as ''"Si Dieu n'existait pas, il faudrait l'inventer"'' ("If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him"), contained in a verse epistle from 1768, addressed to the anonymous author of a controversial work on ''[[Treatise of the Three Impostors|The Three Impostors]]''. But far from being the cynical remark it is often taken for, it was meant as a retort to atheistic opponents such as [[d'Holbach]], [[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm|Grimm]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Peter ''Voltaire's Politics: The Poet as Realist'' (New Haven:Yale University 1988), p. 265: "If the heavens, despoiled of his august stamp could ever cease to manifest him, if God didn't exist, it would be necessary to invent him. Let the wise proclaim him, and kings fear him."&lt;/ref&gt; He has had his detractors among his later colleagues. The Scottish Victorian writer [[Thomas Carlyle]] argued that "Voltaire read history, not with the eye of devout seer or even critic, but through a pair of mere anti-catholic spectacles."&lt;ref&gt;"Beacon Lights of History", p. 207, by Jon Lord, publisher = Cosimo, Inc, 2009. – German Philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], however, called Carlyle a muddlehead who had not even understood the Enlightenment values he thought he was promoting. See – ''Nietzsche and Legal Theory: Half-Written Laws'', by Peter Goodrich, Mariana Valverde, published by [[Routledge]], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of Ferney, where Voltaire lived out the last 20 years of his life, was officially named [[Ferney-Voltaire]] in honor of its most famous resident in 1878.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=430}} His ''[[château]]'' is a museum. Voltaire's library is preserved intact in the [[National Library of Russia]] at [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia. In the Zurich of 1916, the theatre and performance group who would become the early avant-garde movement [[Dada]] named their theater [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|The Cabaret Voltaire]]. A late-20th-century [[industrial music]] group then [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|named themselves]] after the theater. Astronomers have bestowed his name to the [[Voltaire (crater)|Voltaire crater]] on [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] and the asteroid [[5676 Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmadel|first=Lutz D.|author2=International Astronomical Union|title=Dictionary of minor planet names|year=2003|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-00238-3|page=481|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KWrB1jPCa8AC&amp;pg=PA481|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voltaire was also known to have been an advocate for coffee, as he was reported to have drunk it 50–72 times per day. It has been suggested that high amounts of caffeine acted as a mental stimulant to his creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koerner|first=Brendan|title=Brain Brew|url=https://www.unz.org/Pub/WashingtonMonthly-2005jun-00046?View=PDF|work=The Washington Monthly|date=June 2005|pages=46–49|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His great-grand-niece was the mother of [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], a Catholic philosopher and Jesuit priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowell|first=Siôn |title=The Teilhard Lexicon: Understanding the language, terminology, and vision of the writings of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|year=2001|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|location=Brighton|isbn=978-1-902210-37-7|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xormixizYc0C&amp;pg=PR6|accessdate=30 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurian|first=George Thomas|title=The Encyclopedia of Christian Literature|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-8108-6987-5|page=591|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dk4G-52QT-8C&amp;pg=PA591|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''[[Candide]]'' was listed as one of [[The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written]], by [[Martin Seymour-Smith]].
