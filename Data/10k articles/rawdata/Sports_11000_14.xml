'''The Battle of Berne''' is used to refer to a [[association football|football]] match at the [[FIFA World Cup 1954|1954 World Cup]] between [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], a quarter-final played on 27 June 1954 at the [[Wankdorf Stadium]] in [[Berne]], [[Switzerland]].

Violent conduct and fighting prompted English referee [[Arthur Edward Ellis|Arthur Ellis]] to send off three players during the match. Fighting between the teams continued in the dressing rooms after the final whistle.

==Background==
Brazil had scored six goals in two group games, and Hungary had scored 17. Brazil had a reputation for attractive and attacking football; in their group games, they beat Mexico 5–0, and drew the other 1–1 with Yugoslavia after extra time. Yugoslavia had beaten France 1–0 in their other group game, which meant that both Brazil and Yugoslavia were equal on points in their group. Goal difference was not used to decide who finished top of the group; instead, lots were drawn, with Brazil being elected group winners.  Hungary had revolutionized football tactics and coaching in Europe. Their fluid and open style of play – an early form of [[Total Football|total football]] – meant that they were unbeaten for the previous 4 years. Hungary were clear winners of their group, winning both of their group games – they beat South Korea 9–0, and West Germany 8–3.

==The match==
The match was played in driving rain, producing slippery conditions and a hard to control ball. Hungary took the lead in the third minute, with [[Nándor Hidegkuti]] scoring. Four minutes later, [[Sándor Kocsis]] made it 2–0 to Hungary. Brazil was awarded a penalty; [[Djalma Santos]] scored to make it 2–1 at half time.

In the second half, Hungary was awarded a penalty; [[Mihály Lantos]] scored to make the score 3–1. The penalty award was the cue for a pitch invasion by Brazilian journalists and officials, who had to be ushered off by police. The game then degenerated into a series of increasingly violent fouls and cynical tactics, with Brazilian forward [[Júlio Botelho|Julinho]] somehow scoring to bring the score to 3–2. After this, [[József Bozsik]] was fouled by [[Nilton Santos]]; the two men started fighting, and both were sent off. Hungary scored a fourth goal via [[Sándor Kocsis]] to make the score 4–2 to Hungary. The last moments of the game was little more than a running battle between the two teams; Brazilian forward [[Humberto Tozzi]] kicked Hungary's [[Gyula Lorant]] prior to the final whistle and was sent off.

In total, 42 free kicks and 2 penalties were awarded, with 4 cautions and 3 dismissals issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scoreshelf.com/dqcc/en/World_Cup/1954/HUN_v_BRA |title=Hungary vs Brazil: World CUP 1954 Quarter Final |publisher=ScoreShelf.com |accessdate=11 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709114635/http://scoreshelf.com/dqcc/en/World_Cup/1954/HUN_v_BRA |archive-date=9 July 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ill-temper continued after the game, with the Brazilian players invading the Hungarian dressing room and continuing the on-pitch fighting. Despite evidence from independent witnesses of violent conduct from both sides, football's governing body [[FIFA]] did nothing, leaving discipline to the respective countries.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Post-match commentary==
The game's referee [[Arthur Edward Ellis|Arthur Ellis]] commented: "I thought it was going to be the greatest game I'd ever see. I was on top of the world. Whether politics and religion had something to do with it I don't know, but they behaved like animals. It was a disgrace. It was a horrible match. In today's climate so many players would have been sent off the game would have been abandoned. My only thought was that I was determined to finish it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-ellis-a-knockout-during-the-battle-of-berne-1163887.html |title=Football: Ellis a knockout during the Battle of Berne – Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=9 June 1998 |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' newspaper correspondent on 28 June 1954 drew a similar conclusion; "Never in my life have I seen such cruel tackling, the cutting down of opponents as if with a scythe, followed by threatening attitudes and sly jabs when officialdom was engaged elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teora.hit.no/dspace/bitstream/2282/954/1/Brawling_in_Berne.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718171937/http://teora.hit.no/dspace/bitstream/2282/954/1/Brawling_in_Berne.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 July 2011 |title=Gerd von der Lippe |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=12 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"This was a battle; a brutal, savage match," recalled Hungary manager [[Gustav Sebes]], who needed four stitches for a facial wound received during the fighting. "At the end we had won 4–2 but it wasn't over yet. Brazilian photographers and fans flooded on to the pitch and police were called to clear it. Players clashed in the tunnel and a small war broke out in the corridor to the dressing rooms - everyone was having a go; fans, players and officials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2006-05-03-brazil-swap-beauty-for-brutality-in-battle-of-berne |title=Brazil swap beauty for brutality in 'Battle of Berne' – Sport – Mail &amp; Guardian Online |publisher=Mg.co.za |date=3 May 2006 |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Battle of Berne's status in International Football's highest rated matches==
The "''Battle of Berne''" in theoretical abstract terms, was one of the highest ranked contests of the 20th century according to the [[World Football Elo Ratings|Elo rating system]] in men's senior international competition.

[[File:Antique bicycle on antique rollers in US Bicycling Hall of Fame.jpg|right|thumb|antique rollers in [[United States Bicycling Hall of Fame]]]]
'''Bicycle rollers''' are a type of [[bicycle trainer]] that make it possible to ride a bicycle indoors without moving forward. However, unlike other types of bicycle trainers, rollers do not attach to the bicycle frame, and the rider must balance him or herself on the rollers while training. Bicycle rollers normally consist of three cylinders, drums, or "rollers" (two for the rear wheel and one for the front), on top of which the bicycle rides. A [[Belt (mechanical)|belt]] connects the middle roller to the front roller, causing the front wheel of the bicycle to spin when the bicycle is pedaled. The spacing of bicycle rollers can usually be adjusted to match the bicycle's [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Wheelbase|wheelbase]]. Generally, the front roller is adjusted to be slightly ahead of the hub of the front wheel.

== History ==
Bicycle rollers are nearly as old as the bicycle itself. [[Charles Minthorn Murphy|Mile-a-minute Murphy]] is pictured riding on them as early as 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Riding on rollers ==
Balancing the bicycle without riding off the rollers is an extra challenge for the rider and requires much more balance and attention than [[bicycle trainer]]s. Some cyclists find that this increased attention to balance enhances their workout, while other cyclists simply prefer the more stable trainers. Rollers are also used by bicycle racers to finely tune their balance, a skill needed for [[Drafting (aerodynamics)|drafting]] and the close quarters of a [[peloton]] during races. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Novice cyclists often start by placing the bicycle rollers in a hallway or door frame where there is a nearby wall for support in the case of a fall. Removing any sharp and dangerous objects from the area is a must and a helmet is often worn, even though the user might be indoors. Beginners quickly discover that it is easier to maintain one's balance by focusing on a point a few yards ahead rather than looking directly down at the front wheel. In addition, it is easier to stay on the rollers in a higher gear when the wheels are spinning faster. Also, the user has no forward [[momentum]] while on bicycle rollers, which drastically reduces the possibility of injury in the event of a loss of balance or a fall.[[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law]]

==Construction==

===Rollers===
The rollers themselves may be made from [[wood]],&lt;ref name="BikeWorks"&gt;,{{cite web

Some rollers also have a concave cylinder shape (parabolic) to help keep the rider in the center of the rollers.&lt;ref name="BikeWorks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elite Parabolic Rollers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nashbar Parabolic"&gt;{{cite web

===Frame===
The frame may be made from welded steel or extruded aluminum. The frame may fold in the middle for storage or transport.&lt;ref name="BikeWorks"/&gt;

==Variations==
[[File:Indoor trainer.JPG|thumb|A flexible roller system allowing longitudinal movement.]]
Rollers are available in different widths (from 10" to 18") and diameters (from 4.5" to 2.25" for higher resistance).&lt;ref name="KreitlerRollers"&gt;{{cite web 
 |url=http://www.kreitler.com/product.php?section=product&amp;item=which_model

 |archivedate=2008-01-07 
 |df= 
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bicycle rollers use two front drums or cylinders instead of just one.

Resistance may be added by having the spinning rollers driving some additional mechanism such as a fan.&lt;ref name="KreitlerAccessories"&gt;{{cite web 
 |url=http://www.kreitler.com/product.php?section=product&amp;item=accessories

 |archivedate=2008-01-07 
 |df= 
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rollers have an internal flywheel on the back cylinder. This mimics real-world resistance to continuous acceleration and makes it possible to coast for up to 30 seconds.&lt;ref name="TruTrainer"&gt;{{cite web

It is possible to remove the front wheel and mount the front fork in a stand (usually sold separately) to duplicate the stability of other [[bicycle trainer]]s.

Some rollers place the roller frame inside an external track so they can move (slide) fore and aft - which allow for simulating extreme pedalling off the saddle, as if climbing a hill. Strong elastic bands or springs are attached to each corner of the frame and pull and hold the roller frame in the tracks. A bicycle on the road can move fore and aft relative to the rider, and these rollers attempt to duplicate this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.insideride.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1| title= E-Motion Rollers| accessdate= 2009-12-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091030235956/http://www.insideride.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1| archivedate= 2009-10-30| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roller racing==

Rollers may also be used for roller races (or [[goldsprint]]s if fork stands are used). Two or more bikes are placed on rollers side by side, the rollers are connected to a timing system. Timing systems either use modern electronics and digital projection, or a large analog clock with a hand for every rider representing their distance traveled.  Roller racing was popular in 1950s [[United Kingdom|Britain]], often preceding films at the cinema or taking place in between dances at dance halls.&lt;ref name="Rolling the Night Away"&gt;{{cite web

In 1993, the [[Century Road Club Association]] of [[New York City]] retired their vintage rollers and mechanical dial for Kreitler Rollers and a computer system that could clock up to six racers at a time.&lt;ref name="Century Road Club Association January 2003"&gt;{{cite web

The series uses Kreitler Rollers and a DOS program Roller Fusion, which was commissioned in the 1990s by the late Al Kreitler. In honor of Al Kreitler, the promoter of the Iowa Roller Race Series, Greg Harper, organized the 2011 Al Kreitler Memorial Killer 2-Mile Roller Races.&lt;ref name="2011 Al Kreitler Memorial Killer 2-Mile Roller Races"&gt;{{cite web

In [[Modern history of East Asian martial arts|East Asian martial arts]], the '''black belt''' denotes a high competence in the martial art. It is often associated with a teaching grade though frequently not the highest grade or the "expert" of public perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Myths and Misconceptions Part 1 - Vol 44 No. 1|work= Black Belt Magazine|date= |url= http://www.judo-chikara.nl/2014/06/myths-and-misconceptions-part-1-vol-44.html|accessdate= 2010-01-29|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140606221959/http://www.judo-chikara.nl/2014/06/myths-and-misconceptions-part-1-vol-44.html|archivedate= 2014-06-06|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relatively recent invention (dating from the late 19th century).&lt;ref name=judorank&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The systematic use of belt color to denote the rank was first used in Japan by [[Jigoro Kano]], the founder of [[judo]], who first devised the colored belt system using [[obi (martial arts)|obi]] (sash), and awarded the first black belts to denote a [[Dan rank]] in the 1880s.  Previously, Japanese [[Koryu]] instructors tended to provide certificates.&lt;ref&gt;Fumon, Tanaka; ''Samurai fighting arts: the spirit and the practice'', Kodansha International, 2003 {{ISBN|9784770028983}} p25&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the wide obi was used; as practitioners trained in [[kimono]], only [[white belt|white]] and black obi were used. It was not until the early 1900s, after the introduction of the [[judogi]], that an expanded colored belt system of awarding rank was created.&lt;ref name=judorank/&gt; Other martial arts later adopted the custom or a variation of it (e.g., using colored sashes) to denote rank.  This includes martial arts that traditionally did not have a formalized rank structure. This kind of ranking is less common in arts that do not claim a far eastern origin, though it is used in the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]].

==Relative rank==
[[File:PRehse002-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[aikido]] black belts training]]
Rank and belts are not equivalent between arts, styles, or even within some organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karate Belt Ranks — History and Present|url=https://www.fullpotentialma.com/karate-belt-ranks-history-and-present/|publisher=Full Potential Martial Arts, San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In some arts, a black belt is expected in three years, while in others ten years may be common. Testing for black belt is commonly more rigorous and more centralized than for lower grades.

==Ability==
In contrast to the "black belt as master" stereotype, a black belt commonly indicates the wearer is competent in a style's basic technique and principles.&lt;ref name=judorank/&gt; Since in many styles a black belt takes approximately three to six years of training to achieve, a possible analogy might be a [[bachelor's degree]]: the student has a good understanding of fundamental concepts and ability, but has not yet perfected their skills. In this analogy a [[graduate degree]] would represent advancement past the first degree. [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] would be a notable exception to this, as a black belt for a jiu-jitsu practitioner typically takes 7–12 years of training to earn, and a black belt holder is generally viewed as an expert in the art.

Another way to describe this links to the terms used in Japanese arts; [[shodan (rank)|shodan]] (for a first degree black belt), means literally the first/beginning step, and the next grades, nidan and sandan are each numbered as "ni" is two and "san" is three, meaning second step, third step, etc. The [[Shodan (rank)|shodan]] black belt is not the end of training but rather as a beginning to advanced learning: the individual now "knows how to walk" and may thus begin the "journey".

As a "black belt" is commonly viewed as conferring some status, achieving one has been used as a marketing "gimmick", for example a guarantee of being awarded one within a specific period or if a specific amount is paid.&lt;ref name=MichaelJai&gt;{{Cite news|title=Michael Jai White Ignites Black Dynamite |work=Black Belt Magazine |date= |url=http://www.blackbeltmag.com/michael_jai_white_black_dynamite/archives/816 |accessdate=2009-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102132306/http://blackbeltmag.com/michael_jai_white_black_dynamite/archives/816 |archivedate=2010-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools place profit ahead of ability when using these tactics and are sometimes referred to as [[McDojo]]s or belt factories.&lt;ref name=McDojo&gt;Cotroneo, Christian. (November 26, 2006) [[Toronto Star]]. There are also associations that give higher vlack belt grades for a fee for people who join them. The degree is often awarded by people with no competence in the art. That is the reason for many western martial arts teachers who have several 8,9 or 10 degree black belts

.''[https://www.thestar.com/article/154329 Kicking it up at the McDojo.]'' Section: News; Page A12. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016173119/http://www.thestar.com/article/154329 |date=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching===
In some Japanese schools, after obtaining a black belt the student also begins to instruct, and may be referred to as a [[senpai]] (senior student) or [[sensei]] (teacher). In others, a black belt student should not be called sensei until they are sandan (third degree black belt), or the titles kyosa or sabom in [[Korean martial arts]] as second degree or higher, as this denotes a greater degree of experience and a sensei must have this and grasp of what is involved in teaching a martial art.

==Higher grades==
[[File:Rhee TKD Black Belts.jpg|thumb|right|Some martial art schools use embroidered bars to denote different levels of [[Dan rank|black belt rank]], as shown on these [[taekwondo]] 1st, 2nd, and 3rd ''dan'' black belts.]]

In [[Japanese martial arts]] the further subdivisions of black belt ranks may be linked to ''[[dan (rank)#Usage in martial arts|dan]]'' grades and indicated by 'stripes' on the belt. Yūdansha (roughly translating from Japanese to "person who holds a ''dan'' grade") is often used to describe those who hold a black belt rank. While the belt remains black, stripes or other insignia may be added to denote seniority, in some arts, very senior grades will wear differently colored belts. In judo and some forms of [[karate]], a sixth dan will wear a red and white belt. The red and white belt is often reserved only for ceremonial occasions, and a regular black belt is still worn during training. At 9th or 10th dan some schools award [[Red belt (martial arts)|red]]. In some schools of [[Jujutsu]], the [[Shihan]] rank and higher wear purple belts. These other colors are often still referred to collectively as "black belts".&lt;ref name=MichaelJai/&gt;&lt;ref name=BecomingaBB&gt;{{Cite news|title=Becoming A Black Belt|work=Fight Magazine|date=|url=http://www.fightmagazine.com/mma-magazine/mma-article.asp?aid=298&amp;issid=22|accessdate=2010-01-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711002412/http://www.fightmagazine.com/mma-magazine/mma-article.asp?aid=298&amp;issid=22|archivedate=2011-07-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dominican Summer League Red Sox''', often called the '''DSL Red Sox''', are a [[Minor League Baseball]] affiliate of the [[Boston Red Sox]] of [[Major League Baseball]], playing in the foreign [[Dominican Summer League]]. The team, classed as a [[Rookie League]] franchise, plays at the El Toro Complex in the [[Dominican Republic]].

As of the [[2018 Boston Red Sox season]], the field coordinator is [[José Zapata]], and the Red Sox are fielding two teams; one managed by [[Fernando Tatís]] and the other managed by [[Aly González]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/red-sox-announce-minor-league-field-staffs-for-2018/c-264475472 |title=Red Sox announce Minor League field staffs for 2018 |website=[[MLB.com]] |date=January 2018 |accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Red Sox have fielded at least one team in the DSL each season since 1996; the team that season was a cooperative with the [[Houston Astros]]. Since 1997, the Red Sox have fielded their own team. In some seasons, the Red Sox have fielded two teams in the league, "DSL Red Sox 1" and "DSL Red Sox 2". This was the case in 2003, and since 2015, with the exception of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/red_sox/clubhouse_insider/2017/01/red_sox_drop_one_dominican_summer_league_team |title=Red Sox drop one Dominican Summer League team |first=Evan |last=Drellich |newspaper=[[Boston Herald]] |date= January 11, 2017 |accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several seasons, the Red Sox have fielded a cooperative team with one or more other MLB clubs; this was the case in 1989 (with the [[Baltimore Orioles]] and [[Milwaukee Brewers]]), 1990 (with the [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[San Diego Padres]]), 1996 (with the Astros), 2000 (with the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]), and 2001 (with the [[Cleveland Indians]]).

The DSL Red Sox reached the league championship series in 2014, and DSL Red Sox 1 won the league championship series in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sonsofsamhorn.com/baseball/majorleaguebaseball/al-east/boston-red-sox/2016-dsl-red-sox/ |title=The 2016 DSL Red Sox: Taking Pressure Off of Big Papi |first=Brandon |last=Magee |website=sonsofsamhorn.com |date=September 19, 2016 |accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Karami was born into [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni]] family in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] on 26 September 1971.&lt;ref name=katpro&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile|url=http://www.katagogi.com/Profile/Profile.aspx?l=EN&amp;fid=19546&amp;No=f1066997-2650-46fc-8aab-46a70831260a&amp;nAID=195026&amp;PreveVal=8163|publisher=Katagogi|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father is [[Omar Karami]] who was one of the former [[Prime Minister of Lebanon|Prime Ministers]] of [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name=beirut/&gt;&lt;ref name=ala18jan&gt;{{cite news|title=Former PM Karami dismisses attack on his son as "mistake"|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/14694|accessdate=10 March 2013|newspaper=Al Akhbar|date=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the nephew of [[Rashid Karami]], who served as prime minister for ten terms, assassinated by Samir Geagea.&lt;ref name=ala18jan/&gt; Faisal Karami studied business administration in [[the United States]].&lt;ref name=now13jun/&gt;

==Career==

===Controversy===
Karami's appointment led to conflict during the cabinet formation process in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Karami and Arslan obstacles are pending|url=http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArchiveDetails.aspx?ID=281065|accessdate=13 October 2012|newspaper=As Safir|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the conflict was that [[Hezbollah]] had explicitly asked Mikati to assign Faisal Karami as one of the ministers. However, Mikati initially refused this proposal.&lt;ref name=gnews&gt;{{cite news|last=Moubayed|first=Sami|title=Why Najeeb Mikati cannot deliver|url=http://gulfnews.com/opinions/columnists/why-najeeb-mikati-cannot-deliver-1.787478|accessdate=13 October 2012|work=Gulf News|date=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikati argued that if Karami became minister, three of the five seats would be taken by natives of Tripoli (himself, finance minister [[Mohammad Safadi]], and Karami), leading to imbalance in political representation.&lt;ref name=gnews/&gt; Nevertheless, Karami was appointed as a non-affiliated minister chosen by Hezbollah,&lt;ref name=lic/&gt; and became the seventh [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] member of the cabinet after Lebanese Parliament Speaker [[Nabih Berri]]’s [[Amal Party (Lebanon)|AMAL party]] agreed to give up one of its governmental shares for him.&lt;ref name=naharnet&gt;{{cite news|title=Omar Karami’s Brother: Our Family is Not Honored by Being Represented by Faisal|url=http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/8453|accessdate=13 October 2012|work=Naharnet|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mer14jun&gt;{{cite news|title=Mikati unveils 30-member Cabinet dominated by Hizbullah and March 8 allies|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Mikati+unveils+30-member+Cabinet+dominated+by+Hizbullah+and+March+8...-a0260069501|accessdate=10 March 2013|work=The Daily Middle East Reporter|date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karami's appointment was celebrated in his hometown, Tripoli.&lt;ref name=mfr&gt;{{cite news|title=Incendiary Politics |url=http://www.menafundreview.com/incendiary-politics-2/ |accessdate=13 October 2012 |work=Mena Fund Review |date=4 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202101153/http://www.menafundreview.com/incendiary-politics-2/ |archivedate=2 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goan_Sports_Association,_Mumbai.jpg|thumb|Goan Sports Association at the city that used to be called [[Bombay]].]]The '''Goan Sports Association''' is the name of a club (later association) and sporting grounds founded in 1929 in [[Mumbai]] (formerly known as [[Bombay]]), India

==Location==
It is located at [[Cross Maidan]] at [[Dhobi Talao]] in [[Mumbai]] 400002, behind [[Fashion Street]], in the central and downtown part of the city.

==History==
This association, earlier known as a club, had been established in 1929 to promote sports in the bustling megapolis and was the apex body of several sports associations. Football, being a popular sport in the "parent State of [[Goa]]",&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sequeira|first1=Rosy|title=HC to hear plea of Goan Sports against eviction|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/HC-to-hear-plea-of-Goan-Sports-against-eviction/articleshow/18881129.cms|website=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|publisher=Times Of India|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; here too the club had been promoting this sport on the ground for the past four-and-half decades. This had meant "thousands of players, schools and colleges in [[Mumbai]] have benefited from using the playground", it was claimed by supporters of this group.

In a petition made before the courts, the supporters of this association said the players trained by the association were participating in various international and national sport events. The lease was extended in 2004 for 30 years up to 2033.&lt;ref name="TOI" /&gt;

In 2012, news reports spoke about the upgraded medical facilities there.&lt;ref name=DNA&gt;{{cite web|last1=DNA|first1=Correspondent|title=Goan Sports Association upgrades medical facilities|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/report-goan-sports-association-upgrades-medical-facilities-1667858|website=DNAIndia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home for competition==
Goan Sports Association (GSA) grounds has been the venue for a number of football tournaments. For instance, in March 2012, it was the venue for the 15th Goan Sports Association (GSA) veterans’ football tournament for the Late [[Aniceto Fernandes]] Memorial Trophy,&lt;ref name="DNA" /&gt; the Super Division play-off matches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mumbai Strikers beat state police in super division play-off|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/locality/news-tags/goan-sports-association-ground|website=dnaindia.com|publisher=DNA|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.
 
Goa Sports Association has its hockey team too, which was in the Third Division in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/tag/goan-sports-association/|website=IndianExpress.com|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=17 August 2016}} {{deadlink|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hockey team was in the Mumbai first division in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/maidan-magic/article14402177.ece

==Court case==
In March 2013, however, news reports&lt;ref name="TOI" /&gt; said the [[Bombay High Court]] was to then hear a petition by the Goan Sports Association challenging the termination of its lease from a 1,40,000 square feet plot near Cross Maidan. Judges S J Vazifdar and Justice Mridula Bhatkar were to then hear the association's petition challenging the 21 December 2012 government resolution terminating the lease dead of the plot and directing the deputy director of the Sports and Youth Service, Mumbai division, to take further action for recovery of dues and taking possession of the ground.&lt;ref name="TOI" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22145">A '''hidden ball trick''' is a play in which a player deceives the opposing team about the location of the ball. In the game of [[baseball]], the  defense deceives the runner about the location of the ball, in an effort to [[tag out]] the runner. In  [[goal (sports)| ]]-based sports (e.g., [[American football]] and [[lacrosse]]), the offense deceives the defense about the location of the ball, in attempt to get the defense running the wrong way, such as in a [[fumblerooski]].

==Baseball==
In the game of [[baseball]], the  defense deceives the runner about the location of the ball, in an effort to [[tag out]] the runner.
===Execution===
A [[fielder (baseball)|fielder]] may employ the hidden ball trick when a runner is on base. Variations of the play exist: they all involve a fielder keeping the baseball without the runner's knowledge, waiting for the runner to [[lead off]] of his [[base (baseball)|base]], and then quickly [[tag (baseball)|tagging]] the runner out. For the trick to work, the fielder (generally an [[infielder]]) must get the ball while the ball is still [[dead ball|in play]], and the runner must not realize that the fielder has the ball.

Variations of the play usually involve a fielder miming a throw to the pitcher or another defender while keeping the baseball out of sight, often in his glove. If the runner does not detect the deception and realize that the play is still ongoing, he may stray off the base and be tagged out.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Malcolm|title=Ozzie, the spud &amp; the Ol' Hidden Ball Trick: Great stories surround baseball's ancient deception play|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/story/2013/04/12/sp-mlb-kelly-hidden-ball-trick.html|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related tactic is to quickly re-tag the runner after an unsuccessful tag in the hope that his hand or foot has lost contact with the base after a [[slide (baseball)|slide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Malcolm|title=Ozzie, the spud &amp; the Ol' Hidden Ball Trick: Great stories surround baseball's ancient deception play|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/story/2013/04/12/sp-mlb-kelly-hidden-ball-trick.html|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=May 25, 2013}} (describing the move first baseman Dave Bergman used successfully)&lt;/ref&gt;

In most situations, the [[balk]] rule precludes a [[pitcher]] from performing a hidden ball trick.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In high school and college baseball, a balk is called (NFHS R6-S2-A5) if a runner or runners are on base and the pitcher, while he is not touching the pitcher's plate, makes any movement naturally associated with his pitch, or he places his feet on or astride the pitcher's plate, or positions himself within approximately five feet of the pitcher's plate without having the ball. In professional baseball, under Rule 8.05(i), a [[balk]] occurs if the pitcher is standing on or astride of the [[pitcher's rubber|pitching rubber]] without the ball.  As play after a [[foul ball]], [[hit batsman]], or [[time-out (sport)|time out]], must not resume until the pitcher is on the [[pitcher's mound]], the [[infielder]] cannot use these times to obtain the ball.

===Examples===
{{Example farm|section|date=November 2018}}
While variations exist, use of the play in major league baseball is somewhat rare. Some say that the hidden-ball trick has been pulled fewer than 300 times in over 100 years of major league baseball.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;

A [[first baseman]] may attempt the play after a pitcher, in an attempt to [[pick off]] a runner, throws to first. The first baseman then fakes the throw back to the pitcher while keeping the ball in his glove, and if and when the runner leaves the base, tags the runner.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;  [[Dave Bergman]] is a former first baseman who pulled this off on multiple occasions.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt; A second baseman could attempt a similar play after a successful  [[steal (baseball)|steal]] of second base, having received a throw from the catcher.

Former [[second baseman]] [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]] also successfully performed the trick more than once.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt; After a runner reached second base on a ball hit to the outfield, and after receiving the throw in from the outfield, he faked a throw to the pitcher while retaining the ball.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;  To aid the deception, Barrett took the throw with his back to the runner, then placed the ball between the back of his glove and one of his fingers: this way, he exposed his glove to the runner without the ball in the pocket, suggesting that he did not have the ball.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt; Other players have hidden the ball in their armpit.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;

Former [[third baseman]] [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] used a different technique. On more than one occasion, he asked the runner to step off the base so that Williams could sweep the dirt off it, then tagged out the runner when the runner complied.&lt;ref&gt;Zumsteg, Derek. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WphEuMXo50oC&amp;pg=PA66 ''The Cheater's Guide to Baseball'']. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2007, pp. 66-67. {{ISBN|978-0-618-55113-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This worked twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Malcolm|title=Ozzie, the spud &amp; the Ol' Hidden Ball Trick: Great stories surround baseball's ancient deception play|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/story/2013/04/12/sp-mlb-kelly-hidden-ball-trick.html|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=May 25, 2013}} (referencing Zumsteg)&lt;/ref&gt;

Former third baseman [[Mike Lowell]] also made the trick work twice, each time after a throw in from the outfield. The key to Lowell's success was acting, placement, and waiting: acting as if nothing was on, standing away from the bag but not too far from it, and waiting, at least 10 seconds, until the runner on third took a few steps.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;

On June 8, {{Baseball year|2007}}, [[shortstop]] [[Julio Lugo]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]] caught [[Alberto Callaspo]] of the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. However, third baseman Lowell, Lugo's teammate, claimed it was not a true hidden ball trick since the pitcher did most of the work "selling" the trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2007/06/10/lowell_isnt_hiding_his_feelings_on_trick_play/ |title=Boston Red Sox – Lowell isn't hiding his feelings on trick play – The Boston Globe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613043628/http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2007/06/10/lowell_isnt_hiding_his_feelings_on_trick_play/ |archivedate=June 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before Lugo caught Callaspo, Lowell laid claim to the last successful hidden ball trick and held that position for eight years to the day. Lowell's occurred on August 10, {{Baseball year|2005}}, when he, then with the [[Florida Marlins]], caught the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] [[Luis Terrero]], with reliever [[Todd Jones]] on the mound. Lowell also caught [[Brian Schneider]] of the [[Montreal Expos]] in {{Baseball year|2004}}.

Third baseman [[Bill Coughlin]] was reputed to have been the master of the hidden ball trick. Although not verified, Coughlin reportedly pulled it off seven times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.nyyfans.com/archive/index.php/t-87848.html|title=Hidden ball trick [Archive]  - NYYFans.com Forum|website=forums.nyyfans.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/dialed_in/discussion/august_18_2005/|title=BBTF's Dialed In Discussion :: August 18, 2005|website=www.baseballthinkfactory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known recorded and successful example of Coughlin's hidden ball trick was against the [[Detroit Tigers]] on September 24, 1901, as seen from a contemporary description of the game:&lt;blockquote&gt;In returning the sphere to the infield the ball was thrown to our tricky third baseman and he promptly did a little sleight-o'-hand work, his hands moving faster than [[Coach (baseball)|coachers]]' eyes, and shoved the ball up under his arm and assumed his position as it there were nothing wrong. [[Bill Carrick|Carrick]] was standing in the box as if he were about to toss the globule over, and [[Jack Cronin|Cronin]] eased off the [[Base (baseball)|ottoman]] slightly, but enough to get him caught, and he returned to the bench amids the jeers and howls of the populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87062245/1901-09-25/ed-1/seq-3/|title=The Washington times.

In Game 2 of the [[1907 World Series]], Coughlin caught [[Jimmy Slagle]] with a hidden ball trick, the only one in World Series history. The play went from [[Germany Schaefer]] to Coughlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Bill_Coughlin_1877&amp;page=chronology The Ballplayers – Bill Coughlin | BaseballLibrary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103061227/https://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Bill_Coughlin_1877&amp;page=chronology |date=2007-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willie Kamm]] was considered another master of the trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=willie+kamm+baseball+digest&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-2tZpi_gMU&amp;sig=opO2USN7Fu4SzO-dw5Ks1yj_5sk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=n51WTLfLOMT58AabrYTgBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=''Kamm-ouflage!'', by Edgar Munzel, Baseball Digest, November 1956, Vol. 15, No. 10, ISSN 0005-609X|website=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 30, {{Baseball year|1929}}, in a game against the [[1929 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]], Kamm was involved in a rare [[triple play]] involving a hidden-ball trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XiwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=willie+kamm+baseball+digest&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Sy5UC929Nr&amp;sig=wEjX2B57FIIkf9zKSYzSsCRAMGw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=n51WTLfLOMT58AabrYTgBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=''The Old Kamm-aflouge'', by Gordon Cobbledick, Baseball Digest, November 1949, Vol. 8, No. 11, ISSN 0005-609X|website=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indians had [[baserunner]]s on first and second bases when [[Carl Lind (baseball)|Carl Lind]] [[Batted ball|grounded out]] to the [[shortstop]]. [[Johnny Hodapp]], who had been on second base, tried to score but got caught in a [[rundown]] between third and home. [[Charlie Jamieson]] advanced to third.  Kamm retrieved the ball and [[Tag out|tagged]] both runners, whereupon the umpire ruled Hodapp [[out (baseball)|out]]. Kamm then hid the ball under his arm and waited for Jamieson to step off the base. When he did so, Kamm tagged him out to complete the triple play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=willie+kamm+baseball+digest&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V8GLTi5XTv&amp;sig=eKQm4u925C6R-EGEIWC5YWoLVqs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OZhWTOelB4K78gb8zsHABA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=willie%20kamm%20baseball%20digest&amp;f=false|title=Baseball Digest, June 2005, Vol. 64, No. 4, ISSN 0005-609X|website=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2013, [[San Diego Padres]] shortstop [[Everth Cabrera]] attempted to execute the hidden-ball trick on [[San Francisco Giants]] third baseman [[Pablo Sandoval]] after Sandoval hit a double. As pitcher [[Sean O'Sullivan (baseball)|Sean O'Sullivan]] walked onto the mound and Sandoval took his lead, Cabrera, while holding the ball, tagged Sandoval. However, Sandoval had requested and was granted time by second base umpire [[Laz Díaz]] immediately after his double. Because O'Sullivan never assumed his position on the pitcher's plate with the baseball, the umpires appropriately never called "Play" and Cabrera's tag of Sandoval was therefore not legal. The ''Umpire Ejection Fantasy League'' explains this is why a hidden-ball trick may never be executed after a base hit, mound visit, or other event in which "time" is called: in order to put the ball back into play, the pitcher must engage the rubber and if the pitcher engages the rubber without the ball, it is a balk pursuant to Rule 8.05(i).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"[http://www.closecallsports.com/2013/07/case-play-2013-07-hidden-ball-trick.html Case Play 2013-07: Hidden Ball Trick Fails due to Time Out]."

On August 10, 2013, in a Tampa Bay loss to [[2013 Los Angeles Dodgers season|the Los Angeles Dodgers]], 5–0, [[Evan Longoria]], [[2013 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays's]] third baseman pulled the trick in the fourth inning on [[Juan Uribe]]. With the bases loaded and no outs, [[A.J. Ellis]] flied out to center field, with [[Andre Ethier]] tagging to score, Uribe tagging to third and [[Skip Schumaker]] tagging to second. Tampa first baseman (and former Dodger) [[James Loney]] cut off center fielder [[Wil Myers|Wil Myers']] throw at the mound, flipped to shortstop [[Yunel Escobar]], who flipped to third baseman Longoria standing several feet behind third base, out of Uribe's line of sight. Longoria just stood behind the bag looking bored and kicking the dirt for several seconds before he got his chance.   "I was watching it, and I didn't know what to do to stop it", said pitcher [[Zack Greinke]], who was [[on deck (baseball)|on deck]]. "I didn't want to yell at Uribe, because I might get him off [the bag]. I didn't know what to do. He just lifted his foot for a tenth of a second and Longoria was ready for it. As Uribe shifted his weight and took his foot off the third-base bag, Longoria sneaked from behind and slapped Uribe's thigh with a tag. Longoria looked over his shoulder at umpire [[Ángel Hernández (umpire)|Angel Hernández]], who called Uribe out for an 8-3-6-5 double play. In an after-the-game stunt from his teammates, Uribe was presented with a baseball shoe taped to a base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814113401/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130810&amp;content_id=56561040&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb#|title=Rays pull off hidden-ball trick on Dodgers' Uribe {{!}} MLB.com: News|date=2013-08-14|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, 2013, [[2013 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] first baseman [[Todd Helton]] caught [[Matt Carpenter (baseball)|Matt Carpenter]] of the [[2013 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] for the final out of the first inning in a day game at [[Coors Field]]. Helton, who days earlier had announced his retirement after 17 seasons with the Rockies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/rockies/ci_24098500/todd-helton-retire-after-17-seasons-rockies | work=Denver Post | first=Troy E. | last=Renck | title=Todd Helton to retire after 17 seasons with Colorado Rockies | date=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; tagged Carpenter after faking a throw back to pitcher [[Roy Oswalt]] following a pickoff attempt. Carpenter was dusting his hands after a head-first slide when he stepped off the back side of first base towards 1B umpire Bill Miller. Cardinals first base coach [[Chris Maloney]] was unable to help Carpenter before Helton got him with a poking tag. "I've been wanting to do that for 17 seasons. Now I can cross that off my bucket list", said the 40-year-old Helton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/rockies/ci_24136544/heltons-hidden-ball-trick-works | work=Denver Post | first=Patrick | last=Saunders | title=Helton's hidden ball trick works | date=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who at the time was the oldest active professional athlete in Denver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_24136591/peyton-manning-plans-attend-final-home-game-buddy | work=Denver Post | first=Mike | last=Klis | title=Peyton Manning plans to attend final home game for buddy Todd Helton | date=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rockies went on to win 7-6 in a 15 inning game that was the second-longest in Coors Field history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/rockies/ci_24135279/colorado-rockies-win-extra-innings-against-st-louis | work=Denver Post | first=Patrick | last=Saunders | title=Rockies go to 15 innings for dramatic win over the Cardinals | date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the minor leagues, on August 31, 1987, catcher Dave Bresnahan of the [[Williamsport Bills]] pulled an unusual hidden ball trick against the [[Reading Phillies]] in the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]]. With a runner on third base, Bresnahan switched catcher's mitts and put on a glove in which he had secreted a peeled potato. When the pitch came in, Bresnahan fired the white potato down the third-base line, enticing the runner to sprint home. Bresnahan then tagged the runner with the baseball which he kept in his mitt. The umpire awarded the runner home plate for Bresnahan's deception. Bresnahan was banned from the league for the incident, but the fans of the Bills loved the play and the team eventually retired Bresnahan's number.&lt;ref name="spud"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.crosscutters.com/history.htm | title = The Great Potato Caper...

==Goal-based sports==
In  [[Goal (sport)|goal]]-based sports (e.g., [[American football]] and [[lacrosse]]), the offense deceives the defense about the location of the ball, in attempt to get the defense running the wrong way.

===American football===
A hidden ball trick is considered a [[trick play]] in [[American football]].
====Types====
There are various executions of hidden ball plays in American football, including the [[Statue of Liberty play]] and [[Fumblerooski]].

====Examples====
On November 9, 1895 [[John Heisman]] executed a hidden ball trick utilizing quarterback [[Reynolds Tichenor]] to get [[1895 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]]'s only touchdown in a 6 to 9 loss to [[1895 Vanderbilt Commodores football team|Vanderbilt]]. During the play the ball was snapped to a half-back who was able to slip it under the back of the quarterback's jersey and who in turn was able to trot in for the touchdown. This was also the first game in the south decided by a field goal.&lt;ref name=slants&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=897&amp;dat=19310124&amp;id=-aNaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zU8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4042,1045626|author=Alan Gould|title=Sport Slants|work=Prescott Evening Courier|date=January 24, 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heisman later used the trick against [[Glenn Warner|Pop Warner]]'s Georgia team. Warner picked up the trick and later used it at Cornell against Penn State in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1978030//|title=Ball Under The Jersey|work=Lincoln Evening Journal|page=21|date=December 18, 1930|accessdate=March 13, 2015|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then used it in [[1903 Carlisle Indians football team|1903]] at [[1903 Carlisle Indians football team|Carlisle]] against Harvard and garnered national attention.

The hidden ball trick was famously parodied in the 1930s by the [[Marx Brothers]] in the film ''[[Horse Feathers]]'' and by the [[Three Stooges]] in the comedy short ''[[Three Little Pigskins]]''.

===Other goal-based sports===
Hidden ball tricks can be used in rugby&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rugbytoday.com/international/australia-narrowly-defeat-barbarians|title=Australia Narrowly Defeat Barbarians|last=Freeman|first=Allyn|date=2017-10-30|website=www.rugbytoday.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QAXSBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=hidden+ball+rugby+-baseball+-football+-lacrosse&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Dam8vok1zi&amp;sig=GlV9i62tQRH2RSt85r58asH-Dzw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjH4ay2xs_eAhVSDq0KHTfRAo8Q6AEwEnoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hidden%20ball%20rugby%20-baseball%20-football%20-lacrosse&amp;f=false|title=Rugby Classics: Think Rugby: A Guide to Purposeful Team Play|last=Greenwood|first=Jim|date=2015-04-23|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=|isbn=9781472918758|location=|pages=73|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AzF99LuXRf4C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=hidden+ball+rugby+-baseball+-football+-lacrosse&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2WqWE2xW_7&amp;sig=iprmTK51L0JRgu4C2itxesyAVfQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjH4ay2xs_eAhVSDq0KHTfRAo8Q6AEwFHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hidden%20ball%20rugby%20-baseball%20-football%20-lacrosse&amp;f=false|title=Rugby 2nd Edition|last=|first=|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=|isbn=9781450409018|location=|pages=10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lacrosse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidelacrosse.com/article/where-does-joel-tinney-s-fake-flip-goal-rank-all-time/48314|title=Where does Joel Tinney's Fake-Flip Goal Rank All-Time?|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadspin.com/johns-hopkins-lacrosse-pulled-off-a-flawless-hidden-bal-1792133309|title=Johns Hopkins Lacrosse Pulled Off A Flawless Hidden-Ball Trick|last=Kalaf|first=Samer|work=Deadspin|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=18641368|title=Lacrosse hidden ball trick keys win - ESPN Video|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jack Trice Stadium''' (originally '''Cyclone Stadium''' and formerly '''Jack Trice Field''') is a [[stadium]], in [[Ames, Iowa]], [[United States]]. It is primarily used for college football and is the home field of the [[Iowa State Cyclones football|Iowa State Cyclones]]. It opened on September 20, 1975, with a 17–12 win over [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]].

It is the third-largest stadium by capacity in the [[Big 12 Conference]] behind [[Darrell K. Royal - Texas Memorial Stadium]] and [[Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium]], and the third-newest in the conference, behind only [[Mountaineer Field at Milan Puskar Stadium|Milan Puskar Stadium]] of [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] (which had its design based on Jack Trice Stadium) and [[Baylor University|Baylor's]] [[McLane Stadium]]. Including hillside seats in the corners of the stadium, the facility's official capacity is 61,500.&lt;ref name="2015cap"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jack Trice Stadium project on schedule for opening|first=Luke|last=Manderfeld|url=http://www.iowastatedaily.com/sports/article_581386a0-1c3d-11e5-8a0c-337aa7a56a82.html|newspaper=[[Iowa State Daily]]|date=July 26, 2015|accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school announced in May 2014 a planned expansion to 61,500.&lt;ref name="2014may2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Designs for Jack Trice south end zone project released|first=Randy|last=Peterson|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/sports/college/iowa-state/isu-football/2014/05/12/iowa-state-to-break-ground-this-summer-on-stadium-redesign/8998097/|newspaper=[[The Des Moines Register]]|date=May 12, 2014|accessdate=May 18, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140514154059/http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/sports/college/iowa-state/isu-football/2014/05/12/iowa-state-to-break-ground-this-summer-on-stadium-redesign/8998097/|archivedate=May 14, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current record for single-game attendance, 61,500, was set on September 5, 2015, when the Cyclones defeated the University of Northern Iowa 31-7.

Jack Trice Stadium replaced Clyde Williams Field, which had been in use from 1914 through 1974. Williams Field was closed in 1975 and razed in 1978, and Martin and Eaton residence halls now stand on the ground.

==Description==
The stadium consists of double-decked grandstands running the length of either sideline and encompassing the south end zone.  The Richard O. Jacobson Athletic Building, an athletic center built in 1996, is located in the north end zone.  The field itself is slightly lower than the surrounding ground. There is a single main concourse for each of the grandstands. A three-level press box on the west side of the stadium was added to the stadium in 1997 for a cost of $6.2 million. Permanent lighting and a large video/scoreboard behind the bleachers in the south end zone were added in 2002. Later in the summer of 2011 a second video/scoreboard was added on the north side. At triple the size of the previous scoreboard, it stands over the Jacobson Athletic Building. Both scoreboards consist of three levels on the inside, with a camera perch on top. The stadium is part of the [[Iowa State Center]], a sports, entertainment and continuing education complex located to the southeast of the university's main campus. North of the stadium is [[Hilton Coliseum]], home to [[Iowa State Cyclones]] basketball, wrestling, volleyball and gymnastics teams, as well as other events such as musical festivals, rock concerts and university commencement ceremonies.

==Jack Trice==
[[Image:JTcomplex.jpg|thumb|px150|Jack Trice Stadium with statue of Jack Trice in the center of photo, also note the Jacobson and Olsen Building in foreground]]
In 1975, the stadium's playing field was named in honor of [[Jack Trice]], Iowa State's first [[African American]] athlete and the school's first athlete to die of injuries sustained during a Cyclone athletic competition.&lt;ref name="ESPNJTBHM"/&gt;

On October 6, 1923, Trice and his Iowa State College teammates played against the [[University of Minnesota]] in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]]. Because he was African American, on the night of the game, Trice had to stay at a different Minneapolis [[hotel]] than his teammates.

During the second play of the game, Trice's [[collarbone]] was broken.  Trice insisted he was all right and returned to the game. In the third quarter, while attempting to tackle a [[University of Minnesota]] ball carrier by throwing a roll block, Trice was trampled by three Minnesota players.  Although he claimed to be fine, Trice was removed from the game and sent to a Minneapolis hospital.  The doctors declared him fit to travel and he returned by train to Ames with his teammates.  On October 8, 1923, Trice died from [[Bleeding|hemorrhaged lungs]] and [[internal bleeding]] as a result of the injuries sustained during the game.

There was a great deal of speculation surrounding the play that resulted in Jack Trice's death. Many of his teammates claimed after the fact that the Gophers targeted him throughout the first two quarters because of his skin color. ISU teammate Johnny Behm told the Cleveland Plain Dealer in a 1979 interview, "One person told me that nothing out of the ordinary happened. But another who saw it said it was murder." &lt;ref name="African American Registry"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Trice, ISU Football Legend|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/jack-trice-isu-football-legend|publisher=African American Registry|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iowa State dismissed all classes after 3 p.m. on October 9, 1923 in honor of Trice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ames Honors Trice|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/iowa-city-press-citizen/1923-10-10/page-4?tag=jack+trice&amp;rtserp=tags/jack-trice?page=1&amp;pci=7&amp;ndt=by&amp;py=1923&amp;pey=1923|newspaper=[[Iowa City Press-Citizen]]|date=October 10, 1923|accessdate=March 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wore the number "37" in his short career at Iowa State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=You Don't Know Jack: Uncovering the History of Jack Trice|first=Alex|last=Gookin|url=http://www.iowastatedaily.com/sports/article_fd81b208-cbc5-11e2-bc16-001a4bcf887a.html|newspaper=[[Iowa State Daily]]|date=June 6, 2013|accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trice's funeral was held at the Iowa State College central campus in Ames on October 16, 1923, with 4,000 students and faculty members in attendance. Before he was buried, his casket was draped in Iowa State's school colors, cardinal and gold.&lt;ref name="ESPNJTBHM"&gt;{{cite web |title=ISU only I-A School to Honor African-American in Stadium Name|first=Tim|last=Griffin|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/blackhistory2008/news/story?id=3242390|work=[[ESPN]]|date=February 15, 2008|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his death, ISU did not renew their contract to play against Minnesota after the 1924 game. They would not play again until 1989.

Until 1997, the facility itself was known as Cyclone Stadium. Because of persistent requests by the students, the facility was renamed Jack Trice Stadium, making it the only one in [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] named for an African American individual.&lt;ref name="ESPNJTBHM"/&gt;

==Construction==

===Initial construction===
Jack Trice Stadium was completed in less than two years, from its ground breaking on Oct. 26, 1973, to the first game, a victory over [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]] on Sept. 20, 1975.  In late 1973 and spring of 1974, heavy earth-moving equipment shaped the embankments. A huge, movable form shaped the lower decks with thousands of [[cubic yards]] of concrete.  Originally, the stadium had a capacity of 42,500.

===Previous expansions and renovations===
'''1976'''&lt;br&gt;
In 1976, [[bleachers]] were constructed in the [[end zone]]s to increase the stadium's capacity to more than 46,000 (50,000 with standing room tickets).  Before then, all the seating was in the grandstands on the sidelines.

'''1995–1997'''&lt;br&gt;
The stadium complex was transformed in 1995-96 with the construction of the state-of-the-art $10.6 million Richard O. Jacobson Athletic Building, in the north end-zone of Jack Trice Stadium. The Jacobson Building is the home of [[Iowa State Cyclones|Cyclone athletics]] containing all sport and administrative offices except [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|men's]] and [[Iowa State Cyclones women's basketball|women's]] basketball and volleyball.  The Ralph A. Olsen Building was also renovated at that time and it sits attached to the north end of the Jacobson Athletic Building. The Olsen Building, named in honor of prominent [[Ellsworth, Iowa]] farmer and ISU alumnus, houses the strength and conditioning facilities, the team meeting rooms, and the locker rooms.

In 1996, a natural grass field and new drainage system made its debut, the field had been [[AstroTurf]] since 1975. In 1997, the $6.2 million, three-level press tower located on the west side was added to Jack Trice Stadium. The new press tower includes press and radio-television levels and nine sky box suites.&lt;ref name="JTScdc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jack Trice Stadium|url=http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=46691&amp;SPID=4256&amp;DB_OEM_ID=10700&amp;ATCLID=541499|publisher=Iowa State University Department of Intercollegiate Athletics|year=2006|accessdate=April 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2002'''&lt;br&gt;
The football atmosphere at Jack Trice Stadium was enhanced with the installation of a new million-dollar videoboard and scoreboard which replace its black and white predecessor.  Permanent lighting was also added to the side of the stadium for the 2002 season at a cost of $500,000.  Since then, ISU has played twice as many home night games as they did the previous 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2009 Iowa State Football Media Guide|url=http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10700&amp;ATCLID=1524640&amp;KEY=&amp;DB_OEM_ID=10700&amp;DB_LANG=&amp;IN_SUBSCRIBER_CONTENT=|publisher=Iowa State University Department of Intercollegiate Athletics|year=2008|accessdate=April 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:JTphaseI.jpg|thumb|px150|Newly renovated Jack Trice Stadium with new suites between the first and second deck]]

'''2007–2009'''&lt;br&gt;
Between the 2007 and 2009 football seasons, Jack Trice received its largest renovation project to date. With the completion of $30 million in renovations, the stadium has 22 new suites, a new wider concourses with new concessions and bathrooms on the east and west side, a new club section, improved disability seating, new fencing and gates, a new plaza near the main entrance, and many preservative renovations throughout the stadium.

The changes to suites also includes the expansion of two existing suites on the west side of the stadium and the installation of operable windows in all of the current suites.  Funding for these renovations came completely from the sale of stadium suites, club seats, increased ticket revenues and fund raising.

Richard O. "Dick" Jacobson donated $5 million to ISU athletics in 2008, for the purpose of continuing renovations to Jack Trice Stadium.  There will be a Jacobson Plaza constructed near the stadiums main entrance in his honor.  This donation was the largest donation ever made to ISU athletics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jacobson Makes $5 Million Gift to Athletics|url=http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10700&amp;ATCLID=1589073|publisher=Iowa State University|date=September 25, 2008|accessdate=April 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2011''' &lt;br&gt;
A new video/scoreboard was installed on the north end of Jack Trice Stadium.  The screen measures 36 feet high and 79.5 feet wide and has a resolution of 720 x 1,584.   The new video board was completed for the 2011 football season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Renderings For Jack Trice Stadium Videoboard Display|url=http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=48323&amp;SPID=4653&amp;ATCLID=205139702&amp;DB_OEM_ID=10700|publisher=Iowa State University|date=April 20, 2011|accessdate=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2015'''&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Jack trice stadium south endzone.jpg|thumb|View of Jack Trice Stadium's newly completed South End-Zone Project during a football game vs Northern Iowa.]]
On May 1, 2008, [[ISU Athletic Department]] was given permission from the [[Board of Regents, State of Iowa|Iowa Board of Regents]] to continue planning and fund raising for the Jack Trice Expansion.  On November 25, 2013 it was announced that the Reiman family would donate $25 million to help complete the south end-zone project estimated at $60 million.  Iowa State Athletics gained approval from the Iowa Board of Regents for the construction of the south end-zone final phase on February 6, 2014.  Athletic Director Jamie Pollard has stated the target date of the south end-zone project was to complete the expansion before the start of the 2015 football season.  This expansion brought capacity from 54,800 to 61,500.

This south end-zone addition included enclosing the south end zone, which included an upper deck, and connected the east side concourse to the west side concourse. Originally, the south end-zone project was scheduled to be completed at the same time as the east concourse renovation; however, funding was not secured for the south end-zone expansion, so the two projects were completed separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regents Approve Continued Facilities Planning|url=http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&amp;DB_OEM_ID=10700&amp;ATCLID=1446895&amp;SPID=4256&amp;SPSID=46688|publisher=Iowa State University Department of Intercollegiate Athletics|date=May 1, 2008|accessdate=April 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a call in show, ISU athletic director stated that more facility improvements will be continuing over the next few years.  Iowa State's head football coach [[Paul Rhoads]] has also made similar comments.  The $20.6 million Bergstrom football complex,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bergstrom Football Complex|url=http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10700&amp;ATCLID=541505|publisher=Iowa State University Department of Intercollegiate Athletics|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a state-of-the-art training facility was built between the indoor practice facility and the Jacobson building with opening and dedication in 2012.

In 2014, it was announced that Iowa State would enclose their south end zone. This brought capacity to 61,500 including a lower bowl seating 7,500 and an upper bowl seating 5,800. Included in the lower bowl is a two-story, 40,000 square foot premium club with seating for more than 3,000.&lt;ref name="2014AmesT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Football: South End Zone Expansion to Push Jack Trice capacity to 61,500|first=Bobby|last=La Gesse|authorlink=Bobby La Gesse|url=http://amestrib.com/sports/football-south-end-zone-expansion-push-jack-trice-capacity-61000|newspaper=[[Ames Tribune]]|date=May 12, 2014|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future renovations===
Plans are underway to renovate the Jacobsen Building, demolish the Olsen Building and expand/renovate the Bergstrom Football Complex. The plans include a multi-story building situated between the Jacobsen Building and the Bergstrom Football Complex, including a new football locker room, academic center, dining center, and Olympic sports locker rooms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="728">A '''jerk route''' is a [[Route (gridiron football)|route]] run by a receiver in [[American football]]. In essence, it is a shallow [[crossing route]] with a stutter step.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ninersnation.com/2014/9/24/6837665/all-22-49ers-newest-offensive-wrinkle-the-five-wide-empty-package&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea is to isolate the receiver on a linebacker. One stops as if he is receiving a pass on a [[curl route|curl]] or going to retrace his steps, then he has the option to continue across the field, or change direction at an angle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d80aec5fd/article/anatomy-of-a-play-royal-times-two&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23813">This is a list of [[rikishi|wrestlers]] who have won the sumo second division ''[[jūryō]]'' [[yusho|championship]] since 1909, when the current championship system was established. These [[honbasho|official tournaments]] are held exclusively in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = List of successive champions(1990-2010)
| publisher=Sumo Reference | url= http://sumoreference.com| accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wrestler who has won the most ''jūryō'' championships is [[Masurao]], with five.  [[Wakanami]] and [[Tagaryū]] are the only wrestlers to have won a ''jūryō'' championship ''after'' winning a top division or ''[[makuuchi]]'' title. The only wrestlers to win the ''jūryō'' championship but never earn promotion to the top division are [[Genbuyama Genemon|Genbuyama]] (1927), [[Sagahikari Kenji|Sagahikari]] (1957), [[Tochiizumi]] (1983), [[Hidenohana]] (1988) and [[Daigaku]] (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sumoforum.net/forums/topic/34111-trivia-bits/?page=9#comment-315683|title=Trivia bits - Page 9 - Ozumo Discussions - Sumo Forum|last="Asashosakari"|date=23 September 2016|publisher=Sumo Forum|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of a tie a play-off is held between the wrestlers concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Rules of Sumo: Tournament| publisher=Nihon Sumo Kyokai| url=http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_joho_kyoku/shiru/kiso_chishiki/beginners_guide/rules.html#tournament| accessdate=2007-06-05| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601161839/http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_joho_kyoku/shiru/kiso_chishiki/beginners_guide/rules.html#tournament| archivedate=2007-06-01| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Motorsport''' or '''motor sport''' is a global term used to encompass the group of competitive [[Sports|sporting]] events which primarily involve the use of [[motor vehicles|motorised vehicles]], whether for racing or non-racing competition.  The [[terminology]] can also be used to describe forms of competition of two-wheeled motorised vehicles under the banner of [[motorcycle racing]], and includes off-road racing such as [[motocross]].

Four- (or more) wheeled motorsport competition is globally governed by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA); and the [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme]] (FIM) governs two-wheeled competition.

==History==
In 1894, a French newspaper organised a race from [[Paris–Rouen (motor race)|Paris to Rouen]] and back, starting city to city racing.{{sfn|Gifford|page=7}}  In 1900, the [[Gordon Bennett Cup (auto racing)|Gordon Bennett Cup]] was established.  Closed [[circuit racing]] arose as open road racing, on public roads, was banned.  [[Brooklands]] was the first dedicated motor racing track in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Gifford|page=9}}

Following [[World War I]], European countries organised [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix races]] over closed courses.  In the United States, dirt track racing became popular.{{sfn|Gifford|page=10}}

After World War II, the Grand Prix circuit became more formally organised.  In the United States, [[stock car racing]] and [[drag racing]] became firmly established.{{sfn|Gifford|page=11}}

Motorsports ultimately became divided by types of [[motor vehicles]] into racing events, and their appropriate organisations.

===Open wheel racing===
====Formula racing====
[[File:Sebastian Vettel 2012 Malaysia FP2.jpg|275px]]

{{main|Formula racing}}
[[Formula racing]] is a set of classes of motor vehicles, with their wheels outside, and not contained by, any bodywork of their vehicle.  These have been globally classified as specific 'Formula' series - the most common being [[Formula One]], and many others include the likes of [[Formula 3]], [[Formula Ford]], [[Formula Renault]] and [[Formula Palmer Audi]].  However, in North America, the [[IndyCar]] series is their pinnacle open-wheeled racing series.  More recently, new open-wheeled series have been created, originating in Europe, which omit the 'Formula' moniker, such as [[GP2 Series|GP2]] and [[GP3 Series|GP3]].  Former 'Formula' series include [[Formula 5000]] and [[Formula Two]].

=====Formula One=====
{{main|Formula One}}
[[Formula One]] is a class of single-seat and [[Open-wheel car|open-wheel]] grand prix closed course racing, governed by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), and currently organized by the privately owned company [[Formula One Group]]. The formula regulations contain a very strict set of rules which govern vehicle power, weight and size.&lt;ref name="f1fd"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan Noble|author2=Mark Hughes|title=Formula One Racing For Dummies|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/discovering-what-makes-formula-one-formula-one.html|chapter=Discovering What Makes Formula One, Formula One}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Formula E=====
{{main|Formula E}}
[[Formula E]] is a class of open-wheel auto racing that uses only electric-powered cars. The series was conceived in 2012, and the inaugural championship started in [[Beijing]] on 13 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]]|author=Telegraph Sport|date=13 September 2014|title=Formula E opens with spectacular crash involving Nick Heidfeld and Nicolas Prost as Lucas di Grassi claims win|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/11094128/Formula-E-opens-with-spectacular-crash-involving-Nick-Heidfeld-and-Nicolas-Prost-as-Lucas-di-Grassi-claims-win.html|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is also sanctioned by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] and races a spec chassis/battery combination with manufacturers allowed to develop their own electric power-trains. The series has gained significant traction in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Formula E|date=31 July 2017|title=Agag: This has been our take-off season|url=http://www.fiaformulae.com/en/news/2017/july/agag-this-has-been-our-take-off-season/|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====IndyCar Series=====
{{main|IndyCar Series}}
A series originated on June 12th, 1909 in [[Portland, Oregon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openwheelworld.net/indycar/series.php?id=37|title=OpenWheelWorld.Net &gt;&gt; Indy Car historie|first=Haiko Benthem, Patrick|last=Straver|website=www.openwheelworld.net|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its first race. Shortly after, [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway ]] opened in 1909 and held races that ranged from 50-200 miles.  Its premier race is the [[Indianapolis 500]] which began on May 11th, 1911 and a tradition was born. Today, [[Indycar]] operates a full schedule with over 20 teams and 40 different drivers. The current schedule includes 14 tracks over the course of 17 races per season &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indycar.com/Schedule|title=Schedule - Verizon IndyCar Series, Indy Lights, Pro Mazda &amp; Cooper Tires USF2000|website=IndyCar.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Josef Newgarden]] was crowned current champion of the [[Indycar]] Series at [[Sonoma Raceway]] on September 17th, 2017 in Sonoma, California.

===Enclosed wheel racing===
[[File:Neste Oil Rally 2010 - Jari-Matti Latvala in shakedown.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Ford Focus WRC]] rally racing car during [[2010 Rally Finland]]]]
Enclosed wheel racing is a set of classes of vehicles, where the wheels are primarily enclosed inside the bodywork of the vehicle, similar to a North American 'stock car'.

====Sports car racing====
{{main|Sports car racing}}
[[Sports car racing]] is a set of classes of vehicles, over a closed course track, including sports cars, and specialised racing types.  The premiere race is the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] which takes place annually in [[France]] during the month of June.  Sports car racing rules and specifications differentiate in North America from established international sanctioning bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Regulations|url=http://www.fia.com/regulations|website=Federation Internationale de l'Automobile|accessdate=2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;


====Stock car racing====
{{main|Stock car racing}}
[[Stock car racing]] is a set of vehicles, that race over a speedway track, organized by [[NASCAR]]. While once stock cars, the vehicles are now purpose built, but resemble the body design and shape of production cars. Bootleggers throughout the Carolinas are often credited for the origins of [[NASCAR]] due to the resistance during the prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/how-prohibition-gave-birth-to-nascar|title=How Prohibition Gave Birth to NASCAR|website=history.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the vehicles were modified to increase top speed and handling, to provide the bootleggers with an advantage toward the vehicles local law enforcement would use in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/how-moonshine-bootlegging-gave-rise-nascar-180962014/|title=How Moonshine Bootlegging Gave Rise to NASCAR|first=Jennifer|last=Billock|website=smithsonianmag.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important part to the modifications of stock cars, was to increase the performance of the vehicle while also maintaining the same exterior look giving it the name [[Stock car racing]]. Many legends in [[NASCAR]] originated as bootleggers in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] of [[North Carolina]] like [[Junior Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/past-times/article93694277.html|title=Racing legend outran the law|website=newsobserver.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organized oval racing began on Daytona Beach in [[Florida]] as a hobby but quickly gained interest from all over the country. As oval racing became larger and larger, a group gathered in hopes to form a sanctioning body for the sport.&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nascar-founded|title=NASCAR founded - Feb 21, 1948 - HISTORY.com|website=history.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[NASCAR]] was organized in 1947, to combine flat track oval racing of production cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Layford|first1=Bob|title=Built for Speed|publisher=Courage Books|isbn=0762404418|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daytona Beach and Road Course]] was founded where land speed records were set on the beach, and including part of [[A1A]]. The highlight of the stock car calendar is the season-opening [[Daytona 500]], also nicknamed 'The Great American Race' which is held at [[Daytona International Speedway]] in Daytona Beach, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/sports/nascar/2013/02/14/history-of-the-daytona-500/1913949/|title=History of the Daytona 500|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASCAR]] has now held over 2,500 sanctioned events over the course of 70 seasons&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt;. [[Richard Petty]] is known as the king of NASCAR with over 200 recorded wins in the series and has competed in 1,184 races in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/driver/Richard_Petty|title=Driver Richard Petty Career Statistics - Racing-Reference.info|website=racing-reference.info|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Touring car racing====
{{main|Touring car racing}}
[[Touring car racing]] is a set of vehicles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Car Facts {{!}} Pirelli World Challenge|url=http://www.world-challenge.com/pirelli-world-challenge-car-facts.html|website=www.World-Challenge.com|accessdate=2015-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010020949/http://www.world-challenge.com/pirelli-world-challenge-car-facts.html|archive-date=2015-10-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; modified street cars, that race over closed purpose built race tracks and street courses.


====Off-Road Racing====
{{main|Off-Road Racing}}
Off-Road Racing is a group of vehicles that specialize in off-road racing and are modified street cars that can race on close purpose built off-road tracks and courses.  Off-Road racing is popular in areas like [[California]] and [[Arizona]].  Premier off-road events in the United States include the [[Baja 1000]] which takes place in the [[Baja California Peninsula]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.race-dezert.com/home/off-road-racer-grandfather-off-road-racing-baja-1000-117707.html|title=Off-Road Racer: The Grandfather of Off-Road Racing: BAJA 1000 - race-deZert.com|date=21 December 2014|website=race-dezert.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and endures nearly 1000 miles of racing on a closed and pre-designed Baja Truck course. Series like the [[National Off-Road Racing Association]] (NORRA) utilize off-road vehicles which was founded in 1967 to sanction events through the [[Baja California Desert|Baja Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.norra.com/norra.php|title=NORRA: National Off-Road Racing Association, Home of the Mexican 1000 Rally|website=www.norra.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first event sanctioned by the organization was the 1967 Mexican 1000 rally that began in [[Tijuana]] and ended in [[La Paz]].

'''Newcastle Entertainment Centre''' is a multi-purpose Australian [[arena]] within the Newcastle Showgrounds. It was opened in 1992 at a cost of {{AUD|12 million|link=yes}}.

The centre's original tenant was the [[Newcastle Falcons (Australia)|Newcastle Falcons]] [[National Basketball League Australia|NBL]] team who moved to the new venue in 1992 from their previous home at the [[Broadmeadow Basketball Stadium]]. After the Falcons folded at the end of the 1999 season its only tenant was the [[Hunter Jaegers]] [[netball]] team who played in the [[Commonwealth Bank Trophy]]. The Jaegers played in the centre from 1997 until 2008. From 2003 the NEC served as the home court for another NBL team, the [[Hunter Pirates]] (formerly the [[Canberra Cannons]] before the team was moved to [[Singapore]] to become the [[Singapore Slingers]] after the [[2005-06 NBL season]]).

The Newcastle Showgrounds themselves also housed the early [[Newcastle Rebels]] back in 1908-1909. This [[rugby league]] franchise played two seasons in the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]].

The Entertainment Centre is renowned for being one of Australia's most flexible [[multi-purpose stadium]]s, able to accommodate sports events, various performances and expos. The [[Newcastle Show]] uses the Centre for various displays and the showbag area. The stadium has also played host to some of [[Kostya Tszyu]]'s early fights as an Australian-based fighter.

The venue has a listed [[seating capacity]] of 4,658, but it can host anywhere between 2,000 to 7,528 for various events.

The stadium is air-conditioned (installed as a requirement of the NBL when it moved to playing in the summer), equipped with top-grade lights, and also has scoreboards used for basketball and netball games.

The venue is owned by Venues NSW and operated by [[AEG Ogden]].

== Purpose ==
The Newcastle Entertainment Centre was built as a multi-purpose facility to host concerts, sporting events, exhibitions and functions.

== Modes ==

=== Concert ===
The Centre has the following capacities in its different concert modes:
* General Admission mode - up to 7,528 patrons
* End Stage mode - up to 6,193 patrons seated
* Reduced mode - variable between 2,500 and 7,528 patrons

Curtaining allows the adapting of the venues to suit more intimate modes for performers.

=== Sports ===
The Centre has hosted numerous basketball, netball, boxing, bull riding, ice staking and tennis events. In sports mode, the Centre can accommodate between 2,000 to 5,000 patrons.
When [[Newcastle Rebels|Newcastle's team]] competed in the [[NSWRFL Premiership]] in [[1908 NSWRFL season|1908]] and [[1909 NSWRFL season|1909]], the Newcastle Showground was used as the team's home ground.

The Newcastle Showground has also been home to [[Motorcycle speedway]] on and off since 1926, including hosting the first five recognised [[Australian Individual Speedway Championship|Australian Solo Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vintagespeedway.com/Titles.html Australian Solo Championship Honour Board]&lt;/ref&gt; The showground speedway also hosted the [[Australian Sidecar Speedway Championship]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vintagespeedway.com/sidecartitles.html Australian Sidecar Championship Honour Board]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a ½ mile ({{convert|800|m|yd|abbr=off}}) track, its length has been reduced in recent years by about half.

=== Exhibition ===
The seating in the venue is fully retractable providing 4,100 square metres of clear span exhibition space.

=== Function ===
The Centre is able to host functions catering up to 2,000 guests.

'''Nikelshchik''' ({{lang-ru|Никельщик}}) is a [[bandy]] club in [[Verkhny Ufaley]], Russia. The club is playing in the [[Russian Bandy Supreme League]], the second tier of Russian bandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rusbandy.ru/club/401/|publisher= rusbandy.ru|title= «Никельщик» Верхний Уфалей|language= Russian|accessdate= 20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The home games are played at [[Stadium Nikelshchik]] in Verkhny Ufaley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rusbandy.ru/stadium/78/|publisher= rusbandy.ru|title= Стадион «Никельщик», Верхний Уфалей|language= Russian|accessdate= 20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club colours are blue and white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sportnik.ru/| title= МБУ «СОЦ «Никельщик» |language= Russian |accessdate= 20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was founded in 1935.

'''Pitch in for Baseball''' (PIFB) is a non-profit, 501c3 charity which focuses on the collection and distribution of new and gently used [[baseball]] and [[softball]] equipment. The collected equipment is then given to youth leagues in underserved communities around the world. To date, much needed equipment and uniforms have been sent to over 80 countries worldwide and more than 450 communities around the United States. Since its inception in the summer of 2005, PIFB has helped leagues in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Poland]], [[Haiti]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Ghana]], [[Israel]], the [[Ukraine]], [[India]], [[China]] and the hurricane affected [[Gulf Coast]] region of the [[United States]].

==History==
PIFB was founded shortly after [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The organization sent donated equipment to the devastated areas to help revive their local youth baseball leagues. PIFB continues to help communities affected by [[natural disaster]]s.  In June 2011, they donated a great deal of equipment to those in [[Joplin, Missouri]] after the horrific string of [[tornado]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110602&amp;content_id=19939198&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also works will under privileged communities including those in the [[Philadelphia]] area.

Internationally, PIFB has sent equipment to [[Europe]] and is credited with helping raise the popularity of baseball in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090511&amp;content_id=4675336&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Uganda]] little league team competing in the [[2012 Little League World Series]] received its equipment from PIFB. This is being captured by filmmaker [[Jay Shapiro]] for the upcoming documentary [[Opposite Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opposite Field|url=http://opposite-field.com/|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shapiro spent two years in Uganda filming baseball players, and documenting the country's baseball community.&lt;ref&gt;http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101029&amp;content_id=15896972&amp;c_id=mlb&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RIHS''' is a football club from [[Bhutan]],&lt;ref name="RSSSF2007" /&gt; based at [[Changlimithang Stadium|Changlimithang]], who played in the [[A-Division (Bhutan)|Bhutan A-Division]], then the top level of football in Bhutan, but since replaced by a full [[Bhutan National League|national league]].&lt;ref name="RSSSF2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/bhutan2012.html|title=Bhutan 2012|last=Schöggl|first=Hans|last2=Stokkermans|first2=Karel|last3=Jigmi|first3=Sonam|date=28 Feb 2013|website=www.rsssf.com|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spent two seasons in the top flight of Bhutanese football before being relegated following a season that included the record defeat for a football team in Bhutan.

==History==
The first recorded instance of RIHS playing in the top flight of Bhutanese football was in [[2006 A-Division (Bhutan)|2006]].&lt;ref name="RSSSF2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/bhutan06.html|title=Bhutan 2006|last=Schöggl|first=Hans|date=2 Aug 2007|website=www.rsssf.com|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details are lacking for this season and their final position is not known.&lt;ref name="RSSSF2006" /&gt; The only result that is known is a 4–1 loss to [[Yeedzin F.C.|Yeedzin]].&lt;ref name="RSSSF2006" /&gt; It is also not known how they came to be in the A-Division for that season. They were not involved in the final of the B-Division for 2005, which was contested between [[Choden FC|Choden]] and Rookies,&lt;ref name="RSSSF2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/bhutan05.html|title=Bhutan 2005|last=Schöggl|first=Hans|date=4 Oct 2006|website=www.rsssf.com|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; so were presumably not involved in the promotion playoffs that followed. They finished seventh in the [[2007 A-Division (Bhutan)|2007]] season and were relegated.&lt;ref name="RSSSF2007" /&gt; The league table for the 2007 season is incomplete and only a handful of results are known. However, there are a number of results which are notable due to their high scores, both involving very heavy defeats for the Royal Institute of Health and Sciences team:

{{small|Note: RIHS only fielded 9 players.}}

|stadium = 
|referee = 
|attendance = }}

In the game between [[Transport United]] and RIHS FC, [[Passang Tshering]] scored seventeen goals. Sources indicate that the most goals scored by a single player in a game is 16, scored by [[Panagiotis Pontikos]] of [[Olympos Xylofagou]] against [[SEK Ayios Athanasios]] in May 2007 and by [[Stephane Stanis]] for [[RC Strasbourg]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/09/theknowledge.sport|title=The Knowledge&amp;nbsp;– The highest scorer in one game of football|last=Duffin|first=Claire|last2=Lutz|first2=Tom|last3=Baldini|first3=Paolo|date=9 May 2007|website=www.theguardian.com|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear therefore, that Pontikos, having equalled a record that had stood for over 60 years, saw it broken only a few days later.

It is not known whether they competed again, and there is no record of them competing in any future season for which records exist.&lt;ref name="RSSSFChamp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/bhutanchamp.html|title=Bhutan&amp;nbsp;– List of Champions|last=Schöggl|first=Hans|last2=Abbink|first2=Dinant|date=28 May 2014|website=www.rsssf.com|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robertson Gymnasium (UC Santa Barbara) interior.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Robertson Gymnasium interior]]

'''Robertson Gymnasium''' is a 2,600 to 4,000-seat multi-purpose [[indoor arena]] located on the campus of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]].

==History==
Robertson Gymnasium was built in 1958 and completed in 1959.  The architect responsible for creating Rob Gym was [[Charles Luckman Associates]], who was also the main architect for the [[Kennedy Space Center]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]], as well as [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]] and [[Madison Square Garden]].

The stadium was named after Alfred W. Robertson, a former [[California State Assembly]]man instrumental in transferring the facilities of [[Santa Barbara State College]] into the [[University of California]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kerr |first=Clark |authorlink=Clark Kerr |title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949–1967 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=2001 |location= [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] |pages=308 |isbn=0-520-22367-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guide to the Alfred W. Robertson Papers|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt0489p9j3/admin/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenants==
The main tenant of Rob Gym is the [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos]] athletic program.  Currently, only the [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men's volleyball]] team is the only team that calls Rob Gym home, although the [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos women's volleyball|women's team]] have played home games there as well.  In addition to serving as an athletic arena, Rob Gym has seen its fair share of [[concert]]s.  Notable acts to play at Rob Gym include [[Boston (band)|Boston]] on 12 March 1977 and the [[Grateful Dead]] on 29 May 1969, [[Cream (band)|Cream]] on 24 May 1968, [[Jimi Hendrix]] on 11 February 1968, [[The Doors]] on 28 October 1967, and Bruce Springsteen on November 1, 1975, just after his cover of ''Time'' magazine.

Most of the concerts, and with them the Gauchos' [[basketball]] teams, would move to the [[UC Santa Barbara Events Center|Thunderdome]] during the 1979-80 school year.

[[Image:Shin kicking at the Olimpicks.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|A shin-kicking contest|alt=Two men, both in white shirts and jeans, are grasping each other at the shoulders and attempting to kick each other. They are surrounded by an onlooking crowd]]
'''Shin-kicking''', also known as '''hacking'''&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; or '''purring''', is a [[combat sport]] that involves two contestants attempting to [[kick]] each other on the [[Shinbone|shin]] in order to force their opponent to the ground. It has been described as an English [[martial art]].&lt;ref name=ti/&gt; It originated in England in the early 17th century, and was one of the most popular events at the [[Cotswold Olimpick Games]] until the Games ended in the 1850s.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|last=Leighton|first=Neil|title=Old shin sport alive and kicking|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/gloucestershire/4605157.stm|accessdate=6 June 2011|newspaper=BBC|date=3 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also became a popular pastime among Cornish miners. In the 19th century the sport was also practised by British immigrants to the United States.&lt;ref name=tnyt&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientific Shin-Kicking|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1883/01/13/106244611.pdf|accessdate=6 June 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 January 1883}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was included in the 1951 revival of the Cotswold Olimpick Games, and remains one of its most popular events, run as the World Shin-kicking Championships.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The event now draws crowds of thousands of spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/travel/ct-england-alternative-sporting-events-pg-002-photo.html |title=Shin-Kicking (June 1, Dover's Hill, near Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire) |work=Chicago Tribune |date=2012 |accessdate=2016-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During each round, the combatants face each other and hold on to each other's collar. Traditionally (in the Cotswold Olimpicks) they wear white coats, representing shepherds' smocks. They typically attempt to strike their opponent's shin with the inside of the foot as well as their toes.&lt;ref name=ti&gt;{{cite news|last=Godwin|first=Hugh|title=Alternative sports: If mud-racing looks too soft for you, how about a spot of shin-kicking?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/alternative-sports-if-mudracing-looks-too-soft-for-you-how-about-a-spot-of-shinkicking-487722.html|accessdate=6 June 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=2 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success in the event requires both agility and the ability to [[pain tolerance|endure pain]], the loser crying out "sufficient" when he has had enough.&lt;ref name=wfmy&gt;{{cite news|last=Heffernan-Tabor|first=Kelly|title=World Shin Kicking Competition Takes Place In England|url=http://www.digtriad.com/news/watercooler/article/178237/176/World-Shin-Kicking-Competition-Takes-Place-In-England|accessdate=6 June 2011|newspaper=WFMY|date=5 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618103353/http://www.digtriad.com/news/watercooler/article/178237/176/World-Shin-Kicking-Competition-Takes-Place-In-England|archivedate=18 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matches are observed by a referee, or [[wiktionary:stickler|stickler]], who determines the score of the match.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Modern competitions are won by the combatant who wins two out of three against his competitor.&lt;ref name=wfmy/&gt;

Legend has it that some shin-kickers wore [[steel-toe boot]]s during the competitions and tried to build pain tolerance by hitting their shins with hammers. In modern competitions the combatants are required to wear soft shoes and stuff their trouser legs with straw for padding.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Ambulance crews also attend the events in case of injury.&lt;ref name=wfmy/&gt;

'''St George's Park''' (SGP) is the English [[The Football Association|Football Association]]'s [[national football centre]] (NFC)&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.eaststaffsbc.gov.uk/MVM.DMS/Planning%20Application/618000/618893/P-2010-00256_Planning%20Statement.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; built on a {{convert|330|acre|adj=on}} site at [[Burton upon Trent]], [[Staffordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thefootballtacticsblog/2012/02/are_club_and_country_now_worki.html|title=Are club and country now working together?|date=2 February 2012|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre was officially opened by the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Duchess of Cambridge]] on 9 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=St George's Park centre of excellence officially opened |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19881116 |newspaper=BBC Sport |date=9 October 2012 |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the centre is to be the base for all coaching and development work undertaken by the [[The Football Association|FA]], and to be the training and preparation ground for all 28 of the England national football teams at the same time,&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/StGeorgesPark/status/920323432117620737&lt;/ref&gt; including disability, [[futsal]] and those who compete in [[UEFA]] and [[FIFA]] competitions such as:
*[[England national football team|Men's Senior]], [[England national under-21 football team|U-21]], [[England national under-20 football team|U-20]], [[England national under-19 football team|U-19]] and [[England national under-17 football team|U-17]].

==History==
{{Main|Byrkley Lodge}}
Originally part of [[Needwood Forest]], the hunting grounds were developed by the [[Berkeley family]] in the 13th century. After passing into the hands of the crown, in the 1700s the lease again became owned by private individuals. Passing to the Bass family in 1850, the country house was redeveloped in the 1870s, after which an extensive [[horse racing]] stud was developed. After the death of [[Sir William Bass, 2nd Baronet]] in 1952, the estate was sold off and the house demolished.

==Purchase and planning==
Before the proposed development, the FA had two streams of development facility:&lt;ref name=BBC1170459/&gt;
*[[Lilleshall Hall]] had provided coaching for England's best young players, but had been superseded from both a facility and commercial viewpoint by numerous youth academies opened by various football clubs
*[[Bisham Abbey]] is a multi-sport complex which the FA had used for preparing the national team for matches. But the FA wanted a purpose-built, state-of-the-art complex reserved solely for football.

Following research by FA technical director [[Howard Wilkinson]], the FA bought the {{convert|350|acre|adj=on}} site for £2m in 2001 from the [[Forte Group|Forte Hotels]] division of [[Granada plc|Granada Leisure plc]].&lt;ref name=BBC1170459&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1170459.stm|title=FA finds site for training centre|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=14 February 2001|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having researched all existing National Football Centres, Wilkinson's project was based on the French system located at [[INF Clairefontaine|Clairefontaine]] near [[Paris]], which nurtured the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship winners. Projected to cost £30m and proposed to open in 2003, located near the geographical heart of England{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} it would provide the base for Wilkinson and the FA coaching staff to look for and develop the future generations of England stars. The centre's facilities would include 14 pitches, and provide facilities and headquarters from national teams from the age of 14 upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1172213.stm|title=FA unveil academy plans|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=15 February 2001|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the departure of FA [[Chief Executive]] [[Adam Crozier]], the FA reviewed their plans in November 2002. Due to escalating costs at [[Wembley Stadium]], the FA were expected to place an additional £100m into that project. On review, the costs of the national football centre were also revised upwards to £80m. As a result, although the plans were approved, the deadline was relaxed to allow for the difficult financing circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2493107.stm|title=FA reviews academy plan|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=20 November 2002|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 it was decided to mothball the project; in 2004 a proposal to drop the project was delayed until spring 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/england/3702172.stm|title=FA training centre in doubt|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=20 November 2004|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006 the FA board agreed not to invest any further funds into the site until a decision was made on how to proceed, with all options from a sale, to development with partners, open to discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/5347456.stm|title=FA unsure over plans for centre |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=20 September 2006|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitches had already been laid, but construction work on the outbuildings and dressing rooms had not started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7025409.stm|title=McClaren backing national academy|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=3 October 2007|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and facilities==
After the project was finally approved in 2008,&lt;ref name="bbc-football-develop"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/7140806.stm|title=How will English football develop?|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 May 2010 | first=Matt | last=Slater|date=18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; SGP was designed by Red Box Design Group, who also designed the [[Sunderland Aquatic Centre]], [[Sunderland Football Club]]'s [[Academy of Light]] and [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham County Cricket Club's Riverside Ground]]. The centre has 12 world-class training pitches, with both grass and artificial surfaces, one of which is an exact replica of the surface used at [[Wembley Stadium]], and a full-sized indoor pitch. It also has state-of-the-art hydrotherapy suites, biomechanics and training gyms, video analysis amenities, educational and coaching suites and medical and sport science facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19530548|title=St George's Park: A tour of England's new training base|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site's hotel facilities are managed by [[Hilton Hotels]] group, its first site where two of its brands are co-located. The hotels are used by members of the various football teams when they are in residence.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The sports, assessment and medical facilities are all available for hire by sports teams or commercial ventures.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Financing==
Between 2001 and January 2010 the project cost £105m, with the FA contributing £25m. In September 2012 it was announced that SGP would be sponsored by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] as part of a new deal with the England team starting in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/1150289/fa-confirm-nike-deal-for-england?cc=5901 |title=FA confirm Nike deal for England |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=3 September 2012 |accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
The project's chairman, [[David Sheepshanks]], said: "Our aim is to make St George's Park a sporting destination of choice for coaches, players, administrators and officials".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jan/19/national-football-centre-st-georges-park |title=England finally unveil St George's Park - their own Clairefontaine |work=The Guardian |date=19 January 2010 |accessdate=7 January 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intention is that it will be the training base for 24 England teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19530548 |title=St George's Park: A tour of England's new training base |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 September 2012 |accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will act as the focal point for the FA's coaching and player development work. The national football centre will also include offices for the FA's technical experts and accommodation for 300 and sports science and medicine facilities.&lt;ref name="bbc-football-develop"/&gt; The [[League Managers Association]] committed itself to making the new centre their future headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8467595.stm|title=FA revives plans to build England base at Burton|date=19 January 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[1985–86 European Cup|European Cup]] winners [[FC Steaua București|Steaua Bucharest]] have enjoyed the facilities of the St George's Park for their pre-season 2013-14 training camp.&lt;ref name=DM&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2355866/Steaua-Bucharest-Galatasaray-Monaco-use-St-Georges-Park-centre.html|title=English clubs go abroad but Galatasaray, Monaco and Steaua want to use St George's Park to train|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=4 July 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] and [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] also used it to train in the summer of 2013.&lt;ref name=DM /&gt; In March 2014 US NASL team [[Minnesota United FC]] trained at the facility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnunitedfc.com/news/detail/uuid/1tso474rw2m5o1sugu4rpgo7hv/minnesota-united-kingdom-fc-diary-from-across-the-pond&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 it hosted five matches in the group stages of the [[2018 UEFA European Under-17 Championship|European Under-17 Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefa.com/news/2017/oct/26/u17-euros-host-stadiums-announcement Announcement from The FA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
It has been said that the facility is unnecessary; in 2010 Sam Wallace, a football journalist for ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote: "The problem for the FA is that as long as it sits there unfinished, Burton is a stick which the FA's critics use to beat it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/sam-wallace-the-biggest-problem-with-burton-england-do-not-have-any-need-for-it-1870958.html|title=The biggest problem with Burton? England do not have any need for it|last=Wallace|first=Sam|date=18 January 2010|work=The Independent|accessdate=17 May 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work had been halted on the project in 2004 as the FA focussed its financial efforts on the building of the new [[Wembley Stadium]]. In early 2008 the plans were resurrected, with [[Trevor Brooking]] calling for the project to be finished by 2010, stating that without a national football centre "the England coach's job will get that much harder."&lt;ref name="bbc-football-develop"/&gt;

[[File:Pong.png|thumb|right|alt=Pong video game screenshot that is a stylized representation of a game of table tennis.|[[Pong]] is one of the earliest commercial [[Arcade game|arcade]] video games relying on twitch gameplay.]]

'''Twitch gameplay''' is a type of [[video game|video]] [[gameplay]] [[scenario]] that tests a player's [[response time (biology)|response time]]. [[Action game]]s such as [[Shooter game|shooters]], [[sports game|sports]] and [[fighting game]]s often contain elements of twitch gameplay. For example, [[first-person shooter]]s such as ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' as well as ''[[Call of Duty]]'' shooters require quick reaction times for the players to shoot enemies, and fighting games such as ''[[Street Fighter]]'' require quick reaction times to attack or counter an opponent. Other [[video game genres]] may also involve twitch gameplay. For example, the [[puzzle video game]] ''[[Tetris]]'' gradually speeds up as the player makes progress.

Twitch gameplay keeps players actively engaged with quick feedback to their actions, as opposed to [[turn-based game|turn-based gaming]] that involves waiting for the outcome of a chosen course of action. Twitch can be used to expand tactical options and play by testing the skill of the player in various areas (usually reflexive responses) and generally add difficulty (relating to the intensity of "twitching" required).

[[Fast chess]], [[chess]] played with short time limits between moves, is an example of adding a twitch gameplay element to a [[turn-based game]]. Conversely, [[Continue point|checkpoints]] and [[1-up|extra lives]] are common [[game mechanics]] in twitch gaming that attempt to reduce the penalty for errors in play, adding an element of turn-based gameplay. Traditionally, however, the term "twitch game" has been applied to simple [[Arcade game|arcade]], [[Console game|console]], and [[PC game|computer]] games that lack an element of [[strategy video game|strategy]] and are based solely upon a player's reaction time.

==History==
"Twitch" refers to the motion the player makes, a sudden movement or reaction to an event on the screen. An early use of the term was by Vern Raburn of Microsoft in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zamora |first=Ramon |date=1981-04-13 |title=Olympic Decathlon: The Software of Champions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dj4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=%22twitch+game%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCkQuwUwAGoVChMItfGom4OLxwIVEveACh1ITAp3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22twitch%20game%22&amp;f=false |journal=[[InfoWorld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |access-date=2015-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most early computer, arcade, and console games are considered to be "twitch games." They mostly involved ''"see and react"'' situations. For instance, [[Kaboom! (video game)|''Kaboom!'']] had players rapidly catching bombs that a mad bomber threw from a rooftop. Most [[Golden age of arcade video games|classic arcade games]] such as ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Pac-Man]]'' were also twitch-based.

As games and their control inputs evolved, the games started to favor strategy over reaction, early turn-based games being the most prevalent examples. Such games required players to plan each move and anticipate the opponent's moves ahead of time. Not unlike chess, early strategy games focused on setting pieces and then moving them one turn at a time while the opponent did the same. Many of these games were based on [[tabletop games]]. The introduction of the internet, and its suitability as a playable medium, facilitated many of the features of today's mainstream games.

However, that is not to say that all games with a base in strategy do not include room for twitch gameplay. Soon after turn-based strategy games were introduced, [[real-time strategy]] games were introduced to the video gaming market, beginning with ''[[Herzog Zwei]]'' and then ''[[Dune II]]'' and eventually leading to popular titles such as ''[[Command &amp; Conquer]]'', ''[[Warcraft]]'', and ''[[StarCraft]]''. While strategy was still the primary objective, these games played out in real time. Players were required to have fast reactions to enemies' movements and attacks.

Early first-person shooters were very much like early games in general; fast reactions were required and little strategy or thought went into the gameplay. Even the youngest players were able to understand the concept, which may have been the reason such games became instantly popular among a large demographic. Many of the earliest first person games were considered cookie cutter copies of each other; [[Doom (1993 video game)|''Doom'']], ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', and many others looked, played, and felt the same, especially since many shooters were built off the [[Doom engine|''Doom'']] engine. Enemy AI was predictable and levels were simple mazes with secrets and side rooms. While some games included the ability to look up and down, it was rarely required of the player.

==Gameplay today==

Games have become more complex as technology has improved. Today, nearly every genre of video game contains some level of "twitch", though [[turn-based strategy]] games have remained roughly untouched by the phenomenon. First-person shooters remain the predominant genre to emphasize twitch gameplay.

Some games include elements that take players back in nostalgic gameplay in the form of [[quick time event]]s or QTEs. These events decide the fate of the player by displaying a keystroke or keystrokes that the player must input quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldstein|first=Hilary|title=Shenmue II: QTE|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2002/09/30/shenmue-ii-qte|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the concept is not new, the term is often attributed to [[Yu Suzuki]], director of the game ''[[Shenmue]]''. ''Shenmue'' was an [[adventure game]] at its core and it introduced QTEs as a way to keep players interested during extended cut scenes. Other games have since adopted this method (e.g. ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'').

==Twitch in shooters==

Early [[shooter game]]s were [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]], such as the [[shoot 'em up]] ''[[Space Invaders]]'', though some had the guise of being [[2.5D|three-dimensional]], such as the [[rail shooter]] ''[[Space Harrier]]''. Players operated on a single level with enemies, and with the introduction of [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] environments along with enhanced graphics and network capability, shooters continued to be a major influence in the gaming world. The overall tactics and strategies remained the same. Games such as [[Quake (video game)|''Quake'']] encouraged fast-paced destruction. Automatic weapons and rocket launchers ensured quick gameplay. It was still a "twitch game," but over time, gameplay success was determined by more than merely having the fastest reactions. As games evolved, additional layers of strategy were demanded. Over time, strategy won over twitch, especially in team- and objective-based games.

A primary example of this would be the game ''[[Counter-Strike]]''&amp;nbsp;– originally a modification of the popular game [[Half-Life (video game)|''Half-Life'']] that quickly became one of the most popular competitive first-person shooters to date. The base game included objective-based game types that limited the player to a single life per round. Players obtained in-game cash to purchase better weapons and armor. Twitch became a scenario-based event as players wanted to retain the weapons they had worked hard to purchase, knowing a death resulted in losing all the equipment they had obtained.

Many players realized that teamwork and strategy would win over the "[[run and gun (video game)|run and gun]]" tactic. Twitching became something that happened in moments of need versus all the time; for example, a player might have walked around a corner and found an enemy there, in which one would have to react immediately to kill the opponent.

With further advancement in technology and improvement of the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] of computer-controlled enemies, games became more and more about strategy in the shooter genre. A player had to be able to aim precisely to conserve ammo, and often flank large groups of enemies.

Today's shooters still have scenarios where players will have a twitch reaction, but often even those scenarios can be avoided by taking one's time.

Even highly skilled gamers still find themselves in twitch scenarios in shooters. Most are predominantly online, where the actions of the enemy team are unscripted and difficult to predict. Many skilled snipers in these games find themselves "twitching" when flanked; the instinctual reaction is for one to switch to a secondary weapon, which is most often an inaccurate handgun, and spray fire while attempting to find cover.

The predominant reason that shooters do not limit the effectiveness of twitch scenarios is because the average gamer has little time to actually play the game, especially if they play in online lobbies, with the amount of time the average gamer has to play games limited to between two and four hours per day. A game that requires a large amount of skill may deter these gamers from playing at all. At the same time, due to the popularity of the internet, there is a large number of gamers who favor twitch (skill) over strategy. In recent years, videos have appeared across the internet displaying montages of twitch in-game kills. Most of these depict players with sniper rifles hardly aiming or not even aiming at all and getting such kills.

Traditional 2D shooters have survived in the form of [[bullet hell]] shooters, which place a strong emphasis on quick reaction times.

'''West Cliff''' is a [[cricket]] ground in [[Preston, Lancashire]].  The first recorded match on the ground was in 1870, when Preston played a [[United North of England Eleven]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/699_misc.html Other matches played on West Cliff]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the ground held its first [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match when [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] played [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]].  From 1936 to 1939, the ground played host to 4 first-class matches involving Lancashire, the last of which saw them play [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]].  In 1952, Lancashire returned to the ground where they played a single first-class match against Glamorgan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/699_f.html First-Class Matches played on  West Cliff]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground has also played host to a combined total of 15 Second XI fixtures for the Lancashire Second XI in the [[Minor Counties Championship]], [[Second XI Championship]] and Second XI Trophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/699_minc.html Minor Counties Championship Matches played on West Cliff]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/699_sec.html Second XI Championship Matches played on West Cliff]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/699_set.html Second XI Trophy Matches played on West Cliff]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Withers Stakes''' is an American [[Thoroughbred horse race]] for three-year-olds willing to compete one and one-sixteenth mile on the dirt. Held at [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in February, it is a [[Graded stakes race|Grade III]] event, and currently offers a purse of $250,000. 

==History==
The Withers was named for [[David D. Withers|David Dunham Withers]] (1821–1892), an important owner/breeder who won this race in 1890 with his colt, King Eric.

The inaugural run of the Withers Stakes occurred in 1874 at [[Jerome Park Racetrack]]. It was raced there through 1889 after which it was hosted by the [[Morris Park Racecourse]] from 1890 through 1904, then [[Jamaica Racetrack]] in 1956, and at [[Belmont Park]] from 1957 through 1959 and 1984 through 1996.  The Withers was not run in 1911 and 1912 due to a [[New York (state)|New York State]] legislated ban on all forms of wagering on horses.  It was also not run in 2011, but returned to the New York racing calendar on February 4, 2012.

The Withers was historically run at a distance of one mile but was lengthened to {{frac|1|1|16}} miles in 2012. In 1956, it was also contested at a mile and a sixteenth. The "Withers Mile", as it was known to racetrackers, was once one of America's great races, on par with events like England's St.James Palace Stakes (Group 1) (3yo Entire Colts) and France's Prix Jacques Le Marois (Group 1) (3yo Entire Colts and Fillies). Winners included outstanding sires like Dr. Fager, Jaipur, Hagley, Bold Reasoning, Hill Prince, Polynesian, Menow, and Blue Larkspur. In 1919, [[Sir Barton]] won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, then won the Withers before winning the [[Belmont Stakes]] to complete the [[American triple crown|Triple Crown]]. [[Count Fleet]] repeated this feat in 1945. Other famous winners of the race include [[Man o' War]] and [[Native Dancer]].

The Withers is now run in February on Aqueduct's inner track as a prep race on the [[Road to the Kentucky Derby]]. Prior to 2012, it was run in May at Belmont Park.
