'''4chan''' is an English-language [[imageboard]] website. Users generally post anonymously, with the most recent posts appearing above the rest. 4chan is split into various boards with their own specific content and guidelines. Registration is not possible (except for staff).

Launched on October 1, 2003, the site was modeled on Japanese imageboards, particularly [[Futaba Channel]]. 4chan's first boards were originally primarily used for posting pictures and discussing [[manga]] and [[anime]]. The site quickly became popular, expanded, and now features boards dedicated to a wide variety of topics, from anime/manga to videogames, music, literature, fitness, politics, and sports.

The site has been linked to Internet [[subculture]]s and activism groups, most notably [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], the [[alt-right]] and [[Project Chanology]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/09/25/absolutely-everything-you-need-to-know-to-understand-4chan-the-internets-own-bogeyman/|title=Absolutely everything you need to know to understand 4chan, the Internet's own bogeyman|last=Dewey|first=Caitlin|date=September 25, 2014|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/04/08/4chan-rude-raunchy-underbelly-internet.html|title=4Chan: The Rude, Raunchy Underbelly of the Internet|last=|first=|date=April 8, 2009|work=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4chan users have been responsible for the formation or popularization of [[Internet meme]]s such as [[lolcat]]s, [[Rickrolling]], "[[Chocolate Rain]]", [[Pedobear]], and many others. The site's "Random" board, also known as "/b/", was the first board to be created, and is the one that receives the most traffic.&lt;ref name="mit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://projects.csail.mit.edu/chanthropology/4chan.pdf|title=4chan and /b/: An Analysis of Anonymity and Ephemerality in a Large Online Community|author=Bernstein|first=Michael S.|author2=Monroy-Hernandez|first2=Andrés|year=2011|website=Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence|publisher=MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|accessdate=February 27, 2014|author3=Harry|first3=Drew|author4=André|first4=Paul|author5=Panovich|first5=Katrina|author6=Vargas|first6=Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bartlett"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-10/01/4chan-happy-birthday|title=4chan: The Role of Anonymity in the Meme-Generating Cesspool of the Web|last=Bartlett|first=Jamie|date=October 1, 2013|journal=Wired UK|accessdate=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Random board has minimal rules on posted content. [[Gawker]] once jokingly claimed that "reading /b/ will melt your brain".&lt;ref name="Gawker" /&gt; The site's anonymous community and culture have often provoked media attention. 

4chan users have been instrumental in [[pranks]] such as hijacking Internet destinations to [[Rickrolling|cause images of Rick Astley to appear in place of their content]], coordinating attacks against other websites and Internet users, exposing [[animal abuse]], and posting threats of violence in order to elicit individual and public reactions. ''[[The Guardian]]'' once summarized the 4chan community as "lunatic, juvenile&amp;nbsp;... brilliant, ridiculous and alarming".&lt;ref name="TakingRick" /&gt;

==Background==

[[File:Christopher Poole at XOXO Festival September 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christopher Poole]], 4chan's founder, at [[XOXO Festival]] in 2012]]

The activity of 4chan takes place on [[Internet forum|message boards]] and [[imageboard]]s.&lt;ref name="Gawker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="what4chan"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.4chan.org/faq.php#what4chan |title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– What is 4chan? |website=4chan |accessdate=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website is split into six categories: [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]], Interests, Creative, Adult (18+), Other, and Misc (18+). These provide for on-topic boards to discuss [[anime]], [[manga]], technology, sport, photography, music, [[hentai]], [[BitTorrent (protocol)|torrents]], travel, [[physical fitness]], as well as a [[#/b/|random]] board. 4chan originally hosted discussion boards on a separate domain called "world4ch", but these were later moved to the dis.4chan.org subdomain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.4chan.org/faq.php#were |title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– What were 4channel and world4ch? |website=4chan |accessdate=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has had at least one employee, a [[programmer]] whom 4chan's founder [[Christopher Poole]] met via online ''[[Tetris]]''. All other [[Internet forum|moderators]] are volunteers.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; As of 2011, the /b/ (Random), /v/ (Video games), /a/ (Anime and Manga), and /s/ (explicit images) boards were respectively the site's first, second, third, and fourth most popular boards.&lt;ref name="2011japaninterview" group="note"/&gt;

4chan is one of the Internet's most trafficked imageboards, according to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref name="swat" /&gt; 4chan's [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] rank is generally around 700,&lt;ref name="Alexa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/4chan.org|title=4chan.org&amp;nbsp;– Site Information|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Alexa Internet|Alexa]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it has been as high as number 56 at times.&lt;ref name="landers" /&gt; It is provided to its users free of charge and consumes a large amount of [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]; as a result, its financing has often been problematic. Poole acknowledges that donations alone cannot keep the site online, so he has turned to advertising to help make ends meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/news.php?all#95|title=The long and short of it|author=Poole|first=Christopher "moot"|authorlink=Christopher Poole|date=February 12, 2008|website=4chan|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the explicit content hosted on 4chan has deterred businesses who do not want to be associated with the site's content.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Grossman |first=Lev |author-link=Lev Grossman |title=The Master of Memes |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |place=United States |volume=172 |issue=3 |pages=50–51 |date=July 9, 2008 |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1821435,00.html |accessdate=July 24, 2008 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724092400/http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1821435,00.html |archivedate=July 24, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, Poole signed a new deal with an advertising company; in February 2009, he was $20,000 in debt, and the site was continuing to lose money.&lt;ref name="WP-17Feb09"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/16/AR2009021601565.html|title=A Virtual Unknown; Meet 'Moot,' the Secretive Internet Celeb Who Still Lives With Mom|last=Hesse|first=Monica|date=February 17, 2009|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=April 16, 2009|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 4chan servers were moved from Texas to California in August 2008, which upgraded the maximum bandwidth throughput of 4chan from 100Mbit/s to 1Gbit/s.&lt;ref name="beyond"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/news?all#106|title=Beyond One Billion|author=Poole|first=Christopher "moot"|authorlink=Christopher Poole|date=August 6, 2012|website=4chan News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most web forums, 4chan does not have a registration system, allowing users to post [[anonymity|anonymously]].&lt;ref name="TheStar"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/living/article/257955|title=Funny how 'stupid' site is addictive|last=Langton|first=Jerry|date=September 22, 2007|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=July 16, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622184259/http://www.thestar.com/living/article/257955|archivedate=June 22, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.4chan.org/faq.php#postanon |title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– How do I post anonymously? |website=4chan |accessdate=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any nickname may be used when posting, even one that has been previously adopted, such as "Anonymous" or "moot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.4chan.org/faq.php#register |title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– Can I register a username? |website=4chan |accessdate=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In place of registration, 4chan has provided [[tripcode]]s as an optional form of authenticating a poster's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.4chan.org/faq.php#trip |title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– How do I use a "tripcode"? |website=4chan |accessdate=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As making a post without filling in the "Name" field causes posts to be attributed to "Anonymous", general understanding on 4chan holds that Anonymous is not a single person but a collective (hive) of users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.4chan.org/faq.php#anonymous |title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– Who is "Anonymous"? |website=4chan |accessdate=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moderators generally post without a name even when performing [[sysop]] actions. A "capcode" may be used to attribute the post to "Anonymous ## Mod", although moderators often post without the capcode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.4chan.org/faq.php#capcode |title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– What is a capcode? |website=4chan |accessdate=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 interview on [[Nico Nico Douga]], Poole explained that there are approximately 20 volunteer moderators active on 4chan.&lt;ref name=2011japaninterview group=note/&gt; 4chan also has a junior moderation team, called "janitors", who may delete posts or images and suggest that the normal moderation team ban a user, but who cannot post with a capcode. Revealing oneself as a janitor is grounds for immediate dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.4chan.org/faq#whojan |title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– What are "janitors"? |website=4chan |accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4chan has been the target of occasional [[Denial-of-service attack|denial of service attacks]]. For instance, on December 28, 2010, 4chan and other websites went down due to such an attack, following which Poole said on his blog, "We now join the ranks of [[MasterCard]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[PayPal]], et al.—an exclusive club!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12090245|title=Web attack takes Anonymous activists offline|last=|first=|date=December 29, 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=December 29, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230083125/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12090245|archivedate=December 30, 2010 &lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
4chan was started in 2003 in the bedroom of Christopher Poole, a then-15-year-old student from [[New York City]] whose 4chan handle is "moot".&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; Prior to starting 4chan, Poole had been a regular participant on the [[Something Awful]] [[Internet forum|forums]].&lt;ref name=TheStar /&gt; He intended 4chan to be an American counterpart to the popular Japanese [[Futaba Channel]] ("2chan") imageboard and a place to discuss [[manga]] and [[anime]].&lt;ref name="what4chan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/tuning-into-innovation-outside-the-confines-of-english-speaking-web-1.919524|title=Tuning into innovation outside the confines of English-speaking web|last=O'Brien|first=Danny|date=May 2, 2008|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=January 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the creation of 4chan, Poole encouraged users from the [[Something Awful]] subforum titled "Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse", who also happened to be dissatisfied with the forum, to discuss anime on his website.&lt;ref name=forbes2015/&gt; Poole originally used the Futaba Channel to obtain anime-related images, and liked the concept of a message board where people anonymously shared images, which eventually led to his idea of creating a similar English-based website. During the creation of 4chan, he obtained the [[source code]] for the Futaba Channel website, and translated the Japanese text into English using [[AltaVista]]'s [[Yahoo! Babel Fish|Babel Fish]] online translator.&lt;ref name="2011japaninterview" group="note"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TechRev"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/420323/radical-opacity/|title=Radical Opacity|last=Dibbell|first=Julian|date=August 23, 2010|work=[[MIT Technology Review]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 4chan's earliest days, it had only two boards: "/a/ – Anime/General" and "/b/ – Anime/Random" (the very first board to be created); more boards were created over time, and /b/ was eventually renamed to simply "/b/ – Random".{{refn|group=note|name=2011japaninterview|As explained by Poole during a live-video online interview with [[Hiroyuki Nishimura]], founder of [[2channel]], on the Japanese website [[Nico Nico Douga]] during his trip to Japan in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv57271090 |title=Moot x Hiroyuki Social Media Talk Session (ID: 57271090) |date=July 27, 2011 |website=nicovideo.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=TechRev /&gt;

During the early days of 4chan, the boards that originally existed were the anime, random, cute, hentai, and [[yaoi]] boards; a [[lolicon]] board also existed at /l/,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.4chan.org/news/?all#20 |title=News |website=4chan |date=August 14, 2004 |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after being disabled for a week around the turn of the year 2004 it was removed in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jonnydigital.com/4chan-history |title=4chan history &amp;#124; Jonathan's Reference Pages |website=Jonnydigital.com |date= |accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The /g/ board also was initially dedicated to [[Ero guro|guro]], before it was deleted and later remade as the "technology" board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.4chan.org/news/?all#11 |title=News |website=4chan |date=August 14, 2004 |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2004, 4chan briefly went offline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/news/?all#53|title=Ding Dong, 4chan is Dead|author=Poole|first=Christopher "moot"|authorlink=Christopher Poole|date=June 20, 2004|website=4chan News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; then returned fully online a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=August 11, 2004 |author=The Team |url=https://www.4chan.org/news/?all#55 |title=We're Back! |website=4chan News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following 4chan's return, some non-anime related boards, such as the weapons, automobile, and video games boards, were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.4chan.org/news/?all#59 |title=News |website=4chan |date=August 14, 2004 |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, nine new boards were created, including the sports board at /sp/, the fashion board at /fa/ and the "Japan/General" (the name later changed to "[[Otaku]] culture") board at /jp/.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.4chan.org/news?all#96 |title=News |website=4chan |date=February 29, 2008 |accessdate=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Poole announced the deletion of the /r9k/ ("ROBOT9000") and /new/ (News) boards, saying that /new/ had become devoted to racist discussions, and /r9k/ no longer served its original purpose of being a test implementation of [[xkcd]]'s [[ROBOT9000]] script.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |date=January 19, 2011 |url=http://content.4chan.org/tmp/r9knew.txt |title=Why were /r9k/ and /new/ removed? |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6159jR9pC?url=http://content.4chan.org/tmp/r9knew.txt |archivedate=August 20, 2011 |access-date=January 12, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, the /soc/ board was created in an effort to reduce the number of socialization threads on /b/. /r9k/ was restored on October 23, 2011, along with /hc/ ("Hardcore", previously deleted), /pol/ (a rebranding of /new/) and the new /diy/ board, in addition to an apology by Poole where he recalls how he criticized the deletion of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] and realized that he had done the same.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webcitation.org/62dybAZ9z|title=Welcome back, robots|author=Poole|first=Christopher "moot"|authorlink=Christopher Poole|date=October 23, 2011|website=4chan /r9k/}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, 4chan had implemented [[reCAPTCHA]] in an effort to thwart spam arising from [[JavaScript]] worms. By November 2011, 4chan made the transition to utilizing [[Cloudflare]] following a series of distributed denial of service attacks.

===Christopher Poole===
Poole kept his real-life identity hidden until it was revealed on July 9, 2008, in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. Before that time he had used the alias "moot".&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121564928060441097|title=Modest Web Site Is Behind a Bevy of Memes|last=Brophy-Warren|first=Jamin|date=July 9, 2008|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=July 24, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829174144/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121564928060441097.html|archivedate=August 29, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Poole was voted the world's [[Marblecake also the game|most influential person of 2008]] by an open Internet poll conducted by ''Time'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1894028,00.html |title=The World's Most Influential Person Is... |magazine=TIME |date=April 27, 2009 |accessdate=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were questioned even before the poll completed, as automated voting programs and manual [[ballot stuffing]] were used to influence the vote.&lt;ref name="PCMag-moot"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2345987,00.asp |title=4Chan Followers Hack Time's 'Influential' Poll |last=Heater |first=Brian |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |date=April 27, 2009 |accessdate=April 27, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430151912/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2345987,00.asp |archivedate=April 30, 2009 &lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch-moot"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/21/AR2009042101864.html|title=4Chan Takes Over The Time 100|last=Schonfeld|first=Erick|date=April 21, 2009|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=April 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musicmachinery.com/2009/04/27/moot-wins-time-inc-loses/|title=moot wins, Time Inc. loses|last=|first=|date=April 27, 2009|website=Music Machinery|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503031919/http://musicmachinery.com/2009/04/27/moot-wins-time-inc-loses/|archivedate=May 3, 2009&lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=no|accessdate=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4chan's interference with the vote seemed increasingly likely, when it was found that [[acrostics|reading the first letter]] of the first 21 candidates in the poll spelled out a phrase containing two 4chan memes: "mARBLECAKE.

On September 12, 2009, Poole gave a talk on why 4chan has a reputation as a "Meme Factory" at the Paraflows Symposium in [[Vienna|Vienna, Austria]], which was part of the Paraflows 09 festival, themed [[Reality Hacking|Urban Hacking]]. In this talk, Poole mainly attributed this to the anonymous system, and to the lack of data retention on the site ("The site has no memory.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paraflows.at/index.php?id=131 |title=Paraflows 09, Program for Saturday, Sep 12 2009 |website=Paraflows.at |accessdate=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Herwig |first=Jana |url=http://digiom.wordpress.com/2010/04/06/moot-on-4chan-and-why-it-works-as-a-meme-factory/ |title=Moot on 4chan and why it works as a meme factory |website=Digiom Blog |date=April 6, 2010 |accessdate=April 7, 2010}}&lt;!-- note – this reference includes his real name --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

He also explained to the court the nature of the data given to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] as part of the [[search warrant]], including how users can be uniquely identified from site audit logs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i.cdn.turner.com/dr/teg/tsg/release/sites/default/files/assets/poole-testimony.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820204109/http://i.cdn.turner.com/dr/teg/tsg/release/sites/default/files/assets/poole-testimony.pdf |archivedate=August 20, 2010 |title=Transcript of Chris Poole before the Honorable Thomas W.

4chan has been labeled as the starting point of the Anonymous meme by The ''[[Baltimore City Paper]]'',&lt;ref name="landers"&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Landers |title=Serious Business |newspaper=[[Baltimore City Paper]] |date=March 2, 2008 |url=http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=15543 |accessdate=July 13, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608050312/http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=15543 |archivedate=June 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the norm of posts signed with the "Anonymous" moniker. The ''[[National Post]]''{{'}}s David George-Cosh said it has been "widely reported" that Anonymous is associated with 4chan and 711chan, as well as numerous [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC) channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/story.html?id=db57d8d2-ca06-4fe0-8a8b-4975100f7231|title=Online group declares war on Scientology|last=George-Cosh|first=David|date=January 25, 2008|newspaper=[[National Post]]|accessdate=July 13, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603083324/http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/story.html?id=db57d8d2-ca06-4fe0-8a8b-4975100f7231|archivedate=June 3, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=|location=Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through its association with Anonymous, 4chan has become associated with [[Project Chanology]], a worldwide protest against the [[Church of Scientology]] held by members of Anonymous. On January 15, 2008, a 4chan user posted to /b/, suggesting participants "do something big" against the Church of Scientology's website. This message resulted in the Church receiving threatening phone calls. It quickly grew into a large real-world protest. Unlike previous Anonymous attacks, this action was characterized by 4chan [[Internet meme|memes]] including [[rickrolling|rickrolls]] and [[Guy Fawkes mask]]s. The raid drew criticism from some 4chan users who felt it would bring the site undesirable attention.&lt;ref name="landers" /&gt;

==Notable imageboards==
As of May 2017, 4chan hosts 71 imageboards, two of which are hidden, as well as one upload-only [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Frames - 4chan|url=https://www.4chan.org/frames|website=www.4chan.org|access-date=November 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "random" board, '''/b/''', follows the design of Futaba Channel's Nijiura board.

The "no invasions" rule was added in late 2006, after /b/ users spent most of the summer "invading" [[Habbo|Habbo Hotel]]. The "no rules" policy also applies to actions of administrators and moderators, which means that users may be banned at any time, for any reason, including no reason at all.&lt;ref name="4chanTOS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.4chan.org/rules.php#b |title=4chan&amp;nbsp;– Rules&amp;nbsp;– /b/ – Random |website=4chan |accessdate=August 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due partially to its anonymous nature, board moderation is not always successful—indeed, the site's anti-child pornography rule is a subject of jokes on /b/.&lt;ref name="landers" /&gt; Christopher Poole told ''[[The New York Times]]'', in a discussion on the moderation of /b/, that "the power lies in the community to dictate its own standards" and that site staff simply provided a framework.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

Each post is assigned a post number. Certain post numbers are sought after with a large amount of posting taking place to "GET" them. A "GET" occurs when a post's number ends in a special number, such as 12345678, 22222222, or every millionth post.&lt;ref name="faqget"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.4chan.org/faq.php#get |title=FAQ on GETs |website=4chan |accessdate=March 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sign of 4chan's scaling, according to Poole, was when GETs lost meaning due to the high post rate resulting in a GET occurring every few weeks. He estimated /b/'s post rate in July 2008 to be 150,000–200,000 posts per day.&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://time-blog.com/nerd_world/2008/07/now_in_papervision_the_4chan_g.html |title=Now in Paper-Vision: The 4chan Guy |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |first=Lev |last=Grossman |authorlink=Lev Grossman |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=July 24, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828040709/http://www.time-blog.com/nerd_world/2008/07/now_in_papervision_the_4chan_g.html |archivedate=August 28, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet memes==
Many [[Internet meme]]s&amp;nbsp;– catchphrases or images that spread quickly, [[peer-to-peer (meme)|peer to peer]], across the Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/aug/10/technology|title=It's all in the memes|last=Hodge|first=Karl|date=August 10, 2000|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=September 13, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814103615/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2000/aug/10/technology|archivedate=August 14, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=no|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— have originated on 4chan, usually /b/, as its fast moving, [[crowd psychology]] nature enables content to quickly be passed on to large numbers of viewers.
Other memes originating on the site have gained media attention of a lesser degree. These include "[[So I herd u liek mudkipz]]"{{Sic}}, which involves a phrase based on [[Pokémon]] and which generated numerous YouTube tribute videos,&lt;ref name="TheStar" /&gt; and the term "''an hero''"{{Sic}} as a synonym for [[suicide]], after a misspelling in the [[Myspace]] [[online memorial]] of seventh grader Mitchell Henderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|title=The Trolls Among Us|last=Schwartz|first=Mattathis|date=August 3, 2008|newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4chan and other websites, such as the satirical Encyclopedia Dramatica, have also contributed to the development of significant amounts of [[leet]]speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article4173635.ece|title=Scientology: the Anonymous protestors|last=Moran|first=Caitlin|date=June 20, 2008|newspaper=[[The Times]]|accessdate=August 25, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905163346/http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article4173635.ece|archivedate=September 5, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=no|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fandom|Adult fans]] of ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' are also known to frequent 4chan, having had a board dedicated to their interest.&lt;ref name="wsj2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203707504577012141105109140?mod=WSJ_hpp_RIGHTTopCarousel_1#|title=Hey, Bro, That's My Little Pony!

===Lolcats===
{{Main article|Lolcat}}
[[File:Lolcat.jpg|thumb|right|A lolcat image using the "I'm in ur..." format|200px]]
A [[lolcat]] is an image combining a photograph of a cat with text intended to contribute humour. The text is often [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] and grammatically incorrect. In 2005, the meme was widely popularized by 4chan in the form of "Caturday". Every Saturday, users posted pictures of cats with [[image macro]]s relating to that day's theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thedp.com/index.php/article/2007/11/iz_not_cats_everywhere_online_trend_spreads_across_campus|title=Iz not cats everywhere?

===Rickrolling===
{{Main article|Rickrolling}}
In 2005, a meme known as the "duckroll" began, after Poole used a [[Wordfilter|word filter]] to change "egg" to "duck" across 4chan. Thus, words such as "eggroll" were changed to "duckroll". This led to a [[bait-and-switch]] in which external links disguised as relevant to a discussion instead led to a picture of a duck on wheels.&lt;ref name="Fox memes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352010,00.html |title=The Biggest Little Internet Hoax on Wheels Hits Mainstream |website=Fox News Channel |date=April 22, 2008 |accessdate=July 24, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422175015/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352010,00.html |archive-date=April 22, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unidentified 4chan user applied the concept of the duckroll to a 2007 post relating to the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]''. In March of that year, the game's [[Marketing for Grand Theft Auto IV|trailer]] had been released, and the game's immense popularity caused publisher [[Rockstar Games]]' website to [[crash (computing)|crash]]. The user posted a YouTube link that purportedly led to the trailer, but in reality directed users to the music video for [[Rick Astley]]'s 1987 song "[[Never Gonna Give You Up]]". Thus, the "[[rickrolling|rickroll]]" was born.&lt;ref name="Fox memes" /&gt; In an interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Astley said he found the meme "bizarre and funny".&lt;ref name="TakingRick"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/19/news|title=Taking the Rick|last=Michaels|first=Sean|date=March 19, 2008|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=July 24, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727172939/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/mar/19/news|archivedate=July 27, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=no|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox memes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/03/rick-astley-kin.html|title=Web Scout exclusive!

===Internet attacks===

According to the ''Washington Post'', "the site's users have managed to pull off some of the highest-profile collective actions in the history of the Internet."&lt;ref name=Cha&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/09/AR2010080906102.html?hpid=topnews |title=4chan users seize Internet's power for mass disruptions |newspaper=Washington Post|last=Cha|first=Ariana Eunjung |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users of 4chan and other websites "raided" [[Hal Turner]] by launching [[Denial of service attack|DDoS attacks]] and [[prank call]]ing his phone-in radio show during December 2006 and January 2007. The attacks caused Turner's website to go offline. This cost thousands of dollars of bandwidth bills according to Turner. In response, Turner [[filing (legal)|sued]] 4chan, 7chan, and other websites; however, he lost his plea for an [[injunction]] and failed to receive letters from the court.&lt;ref name="halsuecopyright"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-njdce/case_no-2:2007cv00306/case_id-198438/ |website=Justia Federal District Court Filings |title=Harold C.

[[KTTV]] Fox 11 aired a report on [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], calling them a group of "hackers on steroids", "domestic terrorists", and collectively an "Internet hate machine" on July 26, 2007.&lt;ref name="foxnewsanonreport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myfoxla.com/myfox/pages/ContentDetail?contentId=3894628 |publisher=[[KTTV]] ([[Fox Broadcasting Company]]) |website=MyFOX Los Angeles |title=FOX 11 Investigates: 'Anonymous' |date=July 26, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522123812/http://www.myfoxla.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=3894628&amp;version=7&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=VSTY&amp;pageId=1.1.1&amp;sflg=1 |archivedate=May 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slashdot]] founder [[Rob Malda]] posted a comment made by another Slashdot user, Miang, stating that the story focused mainly on users of "4chan, 7chan and 420chan". Miang claimed that the report "seems to confuse /b/ raids and [[motivational poster]] templates with a genuine threat to the American public", arguing that the "unrelated" footage of a van exploding shown in the report was to "equate anonymous posting with domestic terror".&lt;ref name="slashdot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/07/07/28/1145204/ac--domestic-terrorists |title=AC=Domestic Terrorists? |accessdate=July 24, 2008 |author=Miang, [[Rob Malda|CmdrTaco]] (ed.) |date=July 28, 2007 |website=[[Slashdot]]}}&lt;!-- RS: Owner of Slashdot (click wlink) --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later reported that the [[HTML]] [[numeric character reference]] for the symbol had been posted on /b/, with a request to perform a [[Google search]] for the string. A multitude of /b/ visitors followed the order and pushed the symbol to the top of the chart, though Google later removed the result.&lt;ref name="swat"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-et-swastika12-2008jul12,0,7460743.story|title=Rise and fall of the Googled swastika|last=Sarno|first=David|date=July 12, 2008|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=July 14, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080715115928/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-et-swastika12-2008jul12,0,7460743.story|archivedate=July 15, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, the private [[Yahoo!

In September 2010, in retaliation against the [[Bollywood]] film industry's hiring of [[Aiplex Software]] to launch cyberattacks against [[The Pirate Bay]], Anonymous members, recruited through posts on 4chan boards, subsequently initiated their own attacks, dubbed [[Operation Payback]], targeting the website of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Singh |first=Divyesh |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report_bollywood-hiring-cyber-hitmen-to-combat-piracy_1433621 |title=Bollywood hiring cyber hitmen to combat piracy |newspaper=[[Daily News and Analysis]] |date=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Saetang |first=David |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/205813/riaa_mpaa_websites_pummeled_by_4chans_wrath.html |title=RIAA, MPAA Websites Pummeled By 4chan's Wrath |website=PCWorld |date=September 20, 2010 |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gawker.com/5641634/4chan-attack-brings-down-mpaa-website |title=4chan Attack Brings Down MPAA Website |website=Gawker.com |date=September 18, 2010 |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The targeted websites usually went offline for a short period of time due to the attacks, before recovering.

The website of the UK law firm [[ACS:Law]], which was associated with an anti-piracy client, was affected by the cyber-attack.&lt;ref name=wakefield/&gt; In retaliation for the initial attacks being called only a minor nuisance, Anonymous launched more attacks, bringing the site down yet again. After coming back up, the front page accidentally revealed a backup file of the entire website, which contained over 300 megabytes of private company emails, which were leaked to several torrents and across several sites on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/acslaw-anti-piracy-law-firm-torn-apart-by-leaked-emails-100925/ |title=ACS:Law Anti-Piracy Law Firm Torn Apart By Leaked Emails |website=TorrentFreak |author=enigmax |date=September 25, 2010 |accessdate=September 25, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926115653/http://torrentfreak.com/acslaw-anti-piracy-law-firm-torn-apart-by-leaked-emails-100925/ |archivedate=September 26, 2010 &lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 21, 2014, an anonymous poster started a thread on /b/ identifying a student named Westley Sullivan who apparently went to the same high school as the poster. The original post included a link to Westley Sullivan's Facebook profile, which has since been taken down, and a screenshot of a post which said "if fairview isnt closed tomorrow im going to blow it up", referring to Sullivan's high school, [[Fairview High School (Kentucky)|Fairview High School]], in [[Boyd County, Kentucky]]. A few anonymous individuals went to Sullivan's Facebook profile and found his address, phone number, school ID number, school schedule and teachers, and other personal information. Information like his teachers and ID number had been posted directly, and the more personal information like his address was found in the [[Exchangeable image file format|EXIF data]] of some of the pictures posted on his profile. These individuals then contacted Fairview school officials and the local police department, as well as the FBI.

On July 26, 2009, [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[DSL]] branch temporarily blocked access to the img.4chan.org domain (host of /b/ and /r9k/), which was initially believed to be an attempt at [[Internet censorship]], and met with hostility on 4chan's part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/26/att-blocks-4chan-this-is-going-to-get-ugly/ |title=AT&amp;T Reportedly Blocks 4chan. This Is Going To Get Ugly |website=TechCrunch |date=July 26, 2009 |accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centralgadget.com/att-blocking-access-to-portions-of-4chan-2336 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807200251/http://www.centralgadget.com/att-blocking-access-to-portions-of-4chan-2336 |archivedate=August 7, 2009 |title=AT&amp;T Blocking Access to Portions of 4chan (Updated Again) |date=July 26, 2006 |website=CentralGadget |accessdate=July 26, 2006 |first=Christopher |last=Price}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, AT&amp;T issued a statement claiming that the block was put in place after an AT&amp;T customer was affected by a [[denial-of-service attack|DoS attack]] originating from IP addresses connected to ''img.4chan.org'', and was an attempt to "prevent this attack from disrupting service for the impacted AT&amp;T customer, and... our other customers." AT&amp;T maintains that the block was not related to the content on 4chan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2350814,00.asp/ |title=AT&amp;T Confirms 4chan Block After DoS Attack |date=July 27, 2009 |website=PC Mag |accessdate=July 27, 2009 |first=Chloe |last=Albanesius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4chan's founder Christopher Poole responded with the following:&lt;ref name="4chan Status"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://status.4chan.org/index.html#2174049422947602936/ |title=4chan Status |date=July 27, 2009 |accessdate=July 27, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Albanesius |first=Chloe |title=AT&amp;T Confirms 4chan Block After DoS Attack |website=PCMAG |date=July 27, 2009 |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2350814,00.asp |accessdate=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|In the end, this wasn't a sinister act of censorship, but rather a bit of a mistake and a poorly executed, disproportionate response on AT&amp;T's part. Whoever pulled the trigger on blackholing the site probably didn't anticipate [nor intend] the consequences of doing so.

We're glad to see this short-lived debacle has prompted renewed interest and debate over net neutrality and Internet censorship—two very important issues that don't get nearly enough attention—so perhaps this was all just a blessing in disguise.}}

Major news outlets have reported that the issue may be related to the DDoS-ing of 4chan, and that 4chan users suspected the then-owner of Swedish-based website ''Anontalk.com''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,534941,00.html |website=Fox News |title=Feared Hackers Call Off Attack on AT&amp;T |date=July 28, 2009 |access-date=July 28, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729200153/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,534941,00.html# |archive-date=July 29, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Bryant Park Project |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92767742 |title=When Your Pedicurist Is A Fish |website=NPR |date=July 22, 2008 |accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verizon temporary ban===

On February 4, 2010, 4chan started receiving reports from [[Verizon Wireless]] customers that they were having difficulties accessing the site's image boards. After investigating, Poole found out that only the traffic on [[TCP and UDP port|port]] 80 to the ''boards.4chan.org'' domain was affected, leading members to believe that the block was intentional. Three days later, Verizon Wireless confirmed that 4chan was "explicitly blocked". The block was lifted several days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wirelessfederation.com/news/21888-verizon-wireless-restores-4chan-traffic-2/ |title=Verizon Wireless restores 4Chan traffic |website=Wirelessfederation.com |date=February 10, 2010 |accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=October 2007}}
'''Adventure films''' are a [[film genre|genre of film]] that typically use their action scenes to display and explore exotic locations in an energetic way.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Overview==
Subgenres of adventure films include [[swashbuckler film]]s, [[survival film]]s, [[superhero film]]s and [[pirate film]]s. Main plot elements include quests for lost continents and exotic setting; the creation of [[empire]]s, characters embarking on [[treasure hunt|treasure]] and heroic journeys, travels, explorations, quests and searches for the unknown usually also having to overcome an adversary.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Adventure films are often set in a period background and may include adapted stories of historical or fictional adventure heroes within the historical context. [[King]]s, [[battle]]s, [[rebellion]] or [[piracy]] are commonly seen.&lt;ref name="filmsite1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/adventurefilms.html|title=Adventure Films|date=|publisher=Filmsite.org|accessdate=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adventure films may also be combined with other movie genres such as [[action fiction|action]], [[animation]], [[comedy (genre)|comedy]], [[Drama (film and television)|drama]], [[Fantasy fiction|fantasy]], [[science fiction]], [[Children's film|family]], [[Horror fiction|horror]] or [[War film|war]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==History==
Adventure film popularity peaked in the 1930s and 1940s, when films such as ''[[Captain Blood (1935 film)|Captain Blood]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' and ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' were regularly made with major stars, notably [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Tyrone Power]], who were closely associated with the genre.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Saturday morning [[Serial (film)|serials]] used many of the same thematic elements as high-budget adventure films.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In the early days of adventure films, the protagonists were mainly male. These heroes were courageous, often fighting suppression and facing tyrants. Recent adventure films have featured heroines, such as [[Lara Croft]], as protagonists.&lt;ref name="filmsite1"/&gt;

==Popular concepts==
Adventure films can contain stock characters and stereotypes. In some cases, this has been accused of going as far as implicit racism; claimed examples of this are ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', ''[[First Blood]]'' and [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] "kicking third-world people around" in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dancyger|first1=Ken|authorlink=Ken Dancyger|last2=Rush|first2=Jeff|title=Alternative Scriptwriting: Successfully Breaking the Rules|date=2013|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|location=New York|isbn=9780240808499|edition=4th|page=91|quote=Stereotypes abound in the adventure genre. Examples range from the mad scientist in ''Dr. No'' to the mindless thugs in ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom''. The racism implicit in the latter film and films such as ''First Blood'' are by-products of the stereotyping rampant in the adventure genre.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pynchon|first1=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Pynchon|title=[[Slow Learner]]|date=2012|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|location=Boston|isbn=1101594616|quote=Modern readers will be, at least, put off by an unacceptable level of racist, sexist and proto-Fascist talk throughout this story [written in the 1950s]. I wish I could say that this is only Pig Bodine's voice, but, sad to say, it was also my own at the time. The best I can say for it now is that, for its time, it is probably authentic enough. John Kennedy's role model James Bond was about to make his name by kicking third-world people around, another extension of the boy's adventure tales a lot of us grew up reading. There had prevailed for a while a set of assumptions and distinctions, unvoiced and unquestioned, best captured years later in the '70's television character Archie Bunker.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2017}}

'''''All Men Are Liars''''' is a 1995 Australian comedy film written and directed by [[Gerard Lee]], starring [[Toni Pearen]] and David Price.

==Plot==

Barry decides to sell the family piano that belongs to his wife Irene. This results in Irene leaving him and their son Mick. Mick desperately wants his mother to return home and so he decides to save up some money to buy the piano back. The town's annual harvest festival is about to commence and an all-girl band fronted by the beautiful Angela arrives to participate. Mick develops a wacky scheme in which he dresses up in his mother's clothes and becomes 'Michelle', in hopes of joining the girl band to make the money he needs. The scheme works, however Mick becomes increasingly attracted to Angela who has just broken up with her boyfriend after he cheated on her with the band's ex-guitarist. Mick/Michelle eventually earns enough money to buy the piano back, however Angela has since become close to 'Michelle' and has now developed unexpected feelings for her/him. Angela then begins questioning her sexuality and unfortunately for Mick, she has vowed to kill any man who lies to her again.

==Cast==

*[[Toni Pearen]] as Angela
*David Price as Mick/Michelle
*[[John Jarratt]] as Barry
*Jamie Peterson as Tom
*Carmen Tanti as Irene
*Ken Billett as Alf

==Production==
Gerard Lee first came up with the idea for the film in the early 1980s  and wrote several drafts.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Colbert, "All Men Are Liars", ''Cinema Papers", October 1995 p 4-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''All Men Are Liars'' was nominated for the 1995 [[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Film]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112322/awards IMDb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film proved to be successful at the Australian box office grossing approximately $836,606 domestically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=10177&amp;Section=Australian_Films_Domestic_Box_Office_of_All_Time AFI.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224160738/http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=10177&amp;Section=Australian_Films_Domestic_Box_Office_of_All_Time |date=24 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many of the reviews for the film, critics noted the similarities between this film and the 1959 comedy film ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' starring [[Marilyn Monroe]], which also had a storyline about two cross-dressing men who join an all-girl band and fall in love with the beautiful lead singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cinequest.org/event_view.php?eid=674 |title=Cinequest.org |access-date=18 November 2010 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091001062528/http://www.cinequest.org/event_view.php?eid=674 |archive-date=1 October 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.infilm.com.au/?p=341 |title=Infilm.com.au |access-date=18 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706105502/http://www.infilm.com.au/?p=341 |archive-date=6 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American pantomime''', '''panto''' for short, refers to works of theatrical entertainment that have been presented in the United States of America since 1876.  The works are derived from the entertainment genre of [[pantomime]] that developed in England, presented either as they are in Britain or adapted for the American stage and tailored to American audiences.  Pantomime in America, as in England, is usually performed at Christmas time.  The entertainments, aimed at families, are based on nursery stories and [[fairy tales]], and they incorporate songs (traditional, popular and new), slapstick comedy, often topical jokes, magic, some cross-dressing, local references, audience participation, and mild adult innuendo.  

Although pantomime was not frequently produced in the US during the 20th century and is not well known in America, productions of pantomime, both professional and amateur, have been seen nearly every year somewhere in the US over the past couple of decades.

== History in America ==
The earliest known pantomime in the U.S. was ''Robinson Crusoe'' produced at St. John's Theatre, New York in 1786.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/pantomime-origins/ "The origin of popular pantomime stories"], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] website, accessed 10 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A production at Olympic Theatre in New York of ''Humpty Dumpty'' ran for over 1,200 performances in 1868, becoming one of the most successful American pantomimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/Factsheets/The%20History%20of%20Pantomime.pdf "The History of Pantomime"], It's-Behind-You.com, 2002, accessed 10 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==American pantomime today==

In [[rhetoric]], '''antimetabole''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|t|ᵻ|m|ə|ˈ|t|æ|b|ə|l|iː}} {{respell|AN|ti-mə|TAB|ə-lee}}) is the repetition of words in successive clauses, but in transposed order; for example, "I know what I like, and I like what I know". It is related to, and sometimes considered a special case of, [[chiasmus]].

An antimetabole is also said to be a little too predictive because it is easy to reverse the key term, but it can pose questions that one usually would not think of if the phrase were just asked or said the initial way.&lt;ref&gt;Fahnestock, Jeanne. Rhetorical Figures in Science. Oxford University Press, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;123-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Because of You''''' is a 1952 American [[film noir]] [[drama (genre)|drama]] [[romance film]] distributed by [[Universal International]], which was directed by [[Joseph Pevney]] and starred [[Loretta Young]] and [[Jeff Chandler]]. This film was surprising in that it showed a provocative "sexy side" of Ms. Young, quite different from her usual dignified brunette "nice girl" part.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/68313/Because-of-You/ ''Because of You''] at [[TCMDB]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1954, Jeff Chandler said this was his favorite among the films he had made.&lt;ref&gt;FAME ISN'T ENOUGH!: Outspoken Star Would Like to Forsake the Films and Become an Executive
Hopper, Hedda. Chicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963) [Chicago, Ill] 26 Dec 1954: e11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A sexy blonde, still a little fresh off the farm, Christine Carroll (Loretta Young) is preparing to marry her handsome boyfriend. She finds out too late that her fiancé Mike (Alex Nicol) is a gangster and, once he slips stolen merchandise into her purse, she becomes his unwitting accessory. Though she goes to jail, she is innocent of the crime.

Through the kindness of prison psychiatrist Dr. Breen (Alexander Scourby), Christine turns her life around in prison, becoming a nurse's aide in the infirmary. Upon her release, Christine gets a job at a respectable hospital, where she falls in love with wounded combat pilot Steve Kimberly (Jeff Chandler), an architect from good family. Will she ever be able to reveal her sordid past without sending the emotionally fragile Steve off the deep end?

When it's clear that Steve has fallen hard, she faces the dilemma of what and when to tell him. Christine's probation officer encourages her to tell him the truth.  But his wounded psyche makes her decide to keep her past a secret. They marry and Christine is a downright sexy newlywed on her honeymoon.

Her decision has melodramatic consequences... but not at first. As long as her old boyfriend is locked up in prison, and with her name change, Christine believes she is safe. She and Steve have a happy marriage, and soon announce the birth of a child, though Steve shows he isn’t completely well, a little reluctant at first to share Christine even with a child.  But after the new addition, a lovely daughter, he seems more stable and happy.

Christine devotes herself to her husband and daughter.  All is wonderful until her old gangster boyfriend Mike, fresh out of prison, shows up one day, holding her daughter and letting her play with his gun.  Christine pleads with him to release the child - she has no money but offers him all she has if Mike will just leave.

He is willing to let bygones be bygones as long as she drives him down south of the border into Mexico.  He promises if she will do that, he will never bother her again. Trapped, she agrees. But nothing turns out as he promises.  After another robbery, there is a high-speed chase and a crash.  Mike is killed instantly. Christine and daughter survive the wreck physically, but there are plenty of emotional problems as a result.

An enraged Steve accuses Christine (while still in the hospital recuperating from the wreck) of being a tramp and immediately files for divorce, gaining full custody of the child.  He refuses to listen to her side of the story, only taking her prison record, the fact that she was with her old gangster boyfriend and fact that she put his daughter in danger.

Crushed, forbidden from seeing her daughter, she looks to fill the hours. Christine takes a job as an assistant for a magician.  One day she meets up with her sister-in-law, Steve's twin, who comes to her aid.  Christine is asked to perform with the clown at a children's party. Since this is years later, the child does not know that Loretta is her mother. She falls in love with the Magic Lady, who agrees to come to her house for a few days and show her some attention and love.  Unexpectedly, Steve comes home and there are fireworks. Christine points out that their daughter has serious problems and needs the care of a mother. She leaves quietly, ready to never see her child again.

But Christine's magic has cast its spell; Steve looks for her and finds her at her parents' farm, taking a splint off of an animal.  Steve is no longer the emotionally fragile patient; he has healed. Once he got over his anger at his sister's subterfuge, he searched his soul to realize that he needs her now as an equal partner to share life with and to help his daughter grow up to be a strong young woman.

Loretta Young said she found Jeff Chandler very attractive and he told her that he was falling in love with her. She further stated that the relationship never progressed beyond hand-holding outside their love scenes, "but I think until he died, we both felt it.

"'''Break a leg'''" is an [[idiom]] in [[theatre]] used to wish a performer "[[luck|good luck]]" in an ironic way. Well-wishers typically say "Break a leg" to [[actor]]s and [[musician]]s before they go on stage to perform. The origin of the phrase remains obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Urdang |first1=Laurence |last2=Hunsinger |first2=Walter W. |last3=LaRoche |first3=Nancy |title=Picturesque Expressions: A thematic dictionary |publisher=Gale Research |page=321 |year=1985 |isbn=0-8103-1606-4 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression reflects a [[theatrical superstition]] in which wishing a person "good luck" is considered bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6DUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |title=It's a superstitious world: Of black cats, lucky numbers, broken mirrors... |last=Libby |first=Steve |work=The Rotarian |date=July 1985 |pages=30–31 |volume=147 |number=1 |issn=0035-838X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNhaO6gHeSoC&amp;pg=PA203 |page=203 |title=Kids Take the Stage: Helping Young People Discover the Creative Outlet of Theater |last1=Peterson |first1=Lenka |last2=O'Connor |first2=Dan |publisher=Random House Digital |year=2006 |isbn=0-8230-7746-2 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWDrgGosVcwC&amp;pg=PT24 |page=24 |last=Helterbran |first=Valeri R. |title=Exploring Idioms: A Critical-Thinking Resource for Grades 4–8 |publisher=Maupin House Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=1-934338-14-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression is sometimes used outside the theatre as superstitions and customs travel through other professions and then into common use. Among [[Dance|professional dancers]], the traditional saying is not "break a leg," but "''[[Shit#"Merde"_for_"good_luck"|merde]]''".&lt;ref name=McConnell1977&gt;{{cite book |last1=McConnell |first1=Joan |last2=McConnell |first2=Teena |title=Ballet as body language |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1977 |isbn=0-06-012964-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Urbane Irish nationalist [[Robert Wilson Lynd]] published an article, "A Defence of Superstition", in the 1 October 1921 edition of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', a British liberal political and cultural magazine. Lynd regarded the theatre as the second-most superstitious institution in England, after horse racing. In horse racing, Lynd asserted, to wish a man luck is considered unlucky, so "You should say something insulting such as, 'May you break your leg!{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQQuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA427 |page=427 |title=A Defense of Superstition |work=The Living Age |volume=311 |year=1921}} As published in ''The New Statesman'', 1 October 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynd did not attribute the phrase in any way to theatre people, though he was familiar with many of them and frequently mingled with actors backstage. Break a leg is most commonly used to wish an actor in audition to be part of the cast; hence the term "break a leg".

The earliest known example in print is from [[Edna Ferber]]'s 1939 ''A Peculiar Treasure'' in which she writes about the fascination of the theater, "...and all the understudies sitting in the back row politely wishing the various principals would break a leg".&lt;ref&gt;[[Edna Ferber|Ferber, Edna]] (1939). ''A Peculiar Treasure''. Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co. p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bernard Sobel]]'s 1948 ''The Theatre Handbook and Digest of Plays'', he writes about theatrical superstitions: "...before a performance actors never wish each other good luck, but say 'I hope you break a leg.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Sobel|Sobel, Bernard]] (1948). ''The Theatre Handbook and Digest of Plays''. Crown Publishers, p. 722.&lt;/ref&gt; There is anecdotal evidence from theatrical memoirs and personal letters as early as the 1920s.&lt;ref name="WWWords"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bre1.htm |title=Break a Leg |publisher=World Wide Words |accessdate=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISC"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theidioms.com/break-a-leg/ |title=Break a Leg origin|publisher=Theidioms.com |accessdate=2018-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several theories behind the origin of the phrase. Few are supported by contemporary writings. The theories listed below are some of the more popular explanations.

===The leg line===
The edge of a stage was marked with a line known as the "leg" or "leg line". Beyond this point, one could be seen by the audience and those not required to be on stage had to remain back stage and not cross (break) the "leg line". In a time when performers would queue for an opportunity to perform and were only paid if they did perform, to "break a leg" meant the performer crossed the line onto the stage and would therefore get paid. So to tell a performer to "break a leg" was to wish them the luck to have the opportunity to perform and get paid. The sentiment remains the same today, "good luck, give a good performance".{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Similarly, in the days of [[vaudeville]], companies would book more performers than could possibly make it onstage, but would only pay those who performed.&lt;ref name="Theatre Superstitions"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Theatre Superstitions |url=http://www.steppenwolf.org/backstage/article.aspx?id=23 |publisher=Steppenwolf Theatre Company |accessdate=2012-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001031042/http://www.steppenwolf.org/backstage/article.aspx?id=23 |archive-date=1 October 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Renaissance]], [[Theater drapes and stage curtains|stage curtain ''legs'']] have been used as part of the masking in [[proscenium]] theaters, which remain the most popular style of theater to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/479334/proscenium |title=Proscenium (theatre) |publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, to make it on stage, one had to enter the line of sight of the audience or "break a leg", to be paid.&lt;ref name="Theatre Superstitions"/&gt;

===Bowing===
To "break a leg" is archaic slang for bowing or curtsying; placing one foot behind the other and bending at the knee "breaks" the line of the leg. In theatre, pleased audiences may applaud for an extended time allowing the cast to take multiple [[curtain call]]s, bowing to the audience. 

Related to this, some argue the mechanism for raising and lowering the curtain was controlled by a crank arm 'leg'. Therefore for popular performers, continued curtain calls may result in a broken crank arm.&lt;ref name="Phrase.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/break-a-leg.html |title=Break a leg |publisher=phrases.org.uk |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek origin===
In the time of [[Ancient Greece]], people didn't clap. Instead, they stomped for their appreciation and if they stomped long enough, they would break a leg. Or, some would have it that the term originated during Elizabethan times when, instead of applause the audience would bang their chairs on the ground—and if they liked it enough, the leg of the chair would break.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Theatre Superstitions |url=http://www.steppenwolf.org/backstage/article.aspx?id=23 |publisher=Steppenwolf Theatre Company |accessdate=2006-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001031042/http://www.steppenwolf.org/backstage/article.aspx?id=23 |archive-date=1 October 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German and Yiddish origin===
Some etymologists believe it to be an adaptation from the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] translation into German. The phrase "Hatsloche un Broche" (הצלחה און ברכה) ("success and blessing") had been calqued from the German phrase "Hals- und Beinbruch" ("neck and leg fracture"), because of its similar pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Israel, 'Phrase Origins: "Break a leg!{{"'}}, [http://www.yaelf.com/aueFAQ/mifbreakaleg.shtml The alt.usage.english FAQ file] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116023111/http://www.yaelf.com/aueFAQ/mifbreakaleg.shtml |date=16 November 2006 }},(line 4544), (29 Sept 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The autobiography of [[Manfred von Richthofen]] records pilots of the German [[Luftstreitkräfte | air force]] during the First World War as using the phrase "Hals- und Beinbruch" (neck and leg fracture) to wish each other luck before a flight.&lt;ref name="Phrase.org"/&gt; The phrase is now most typically used to wish an actor good luck before a performance, or a student good luck before an exam.

===Lincoln theory===
One popular, but false, etymology derives the phrase from the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|1865 assassination of Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/site/comments/break_a_leg/ |title=Break a leg |first=Dave |last=Wilton |accessdate=2011-04-13 |work=Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story goes that [[John Wilkes Booth]], the actor turned assassin, claimed in his diary that he broke his leg leaping to the stage of [[Ford's Theatre]] after murdering the President. While Booth's roles as an actor are not well remembered, wishing an actor to "break a leg" is to wish them a performance worthy of remembrance. However, the fact that actors did not start wishing each other to "break a leg" until the 1920s (more than 50 years later) makes this an unlikely source.&lt;ref name="ISC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/28/messages/867.html |title=Re: Break a Leg |publisher=Phrases.org.uk |accessdate=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the phrase has distinct origins in other languages that well predate the late 19th century. Also, some historians contend that he broke his leg when he fell from his horse trying to escape. They also cite that Booth often exaggerated and falsified his diary entries to make them more dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kauffman |first=Michael W. |title=John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies |publisher=American Brutus |year=2004 |isbn=0-375-75974-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative meaning===
There is an older meaning of "break a leg" going back to the 17th and 18th Century that refers to having "a bastard / natural child". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/break-a-leg.html |title=Break a leg |first=Gary |last=Martin |accessdate=2018-10-03 |work=Word Phrase Finder: Break a leg |publisher= The Phrase Finder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-literal===
There are many non-literal references this expression could be referring to.
* Another popular alternative theory concerning the physical "legs," or side curtains, of the theatre proposes that the company of actors should rush onstage through the curtains to take a considerable amount of bows, thus "breaking a leg (side curtain)" in the process.&lt;ref name="WWWords"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phrase.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IDIOM"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theidioms.com/break-a-leg/ |title=Break a Leg idiom|publisher=Theidioms.com |accessdate=2018-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To get a leg up, and catch your big / lucky break.&lt;ref name="WWWords"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phrase.org"/&gt;

===''Richard III'' theory===
Some attribute the line to a performance of Shakespeare's [[Richard III (play)|''Richard III'']], where the famed 18th-century British actor, [[David Garrick]], became so entranced in the performance that he was unaware of a fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.r3.org/bookcase/cibber.html |title=Richard III as rewritten by Colley Cibber |accessdate=2008-04-11 |author=Tom Dale Keever |date=18 December 1995 |work=Primary Texts and Secondary Sources On-line |publisher=Richard III Society—American Branch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317002752/http://www.r3.org/bookcase/cibber.html |archivedate=17 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative terms==
Professional dancers do not wish each other good luck by saying "break a leg"; instead they say "''[[Merde]]!''", the French word for "shit".&lt;ref name=McConnell1977/&gt; In turn, theater people have picked up this usage and may wish each other "''merde''", alone or in combination with "break a leg". In Spanish, the phrase is "''mucha mierda''", or "lots of shit". This term refers to the times when carriages would take the audience to the theatre. A quick look to the street in front of the venue would tell if the play was successful: a lot of horse [[Manure|dung]] would mean many carriages had stopped to leave spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=The QI Elves|title=No Such Thing As The Ugly Panda|url=https://soundbutt.com/nosuchthingasafish/episode-62-no-such-thing-as-the-ugly-panda|accessdate=7 June 2015|work=No Such Thing as a Fish|issue=62|publisher=Quite Interesting Ltd.}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opera singers use "''[[Toi toi toi]]''", an idiom used to ward off a [[spell (paranormal)|spell]] or [[Curse|hex]], often accompanied by knocking on wood, and onomatopoeic, spitting (or imitating the sound of spitting). Saliva traditionally had demon-banishing powers. From [[Rotwelsch]] ''tof'', from [[Yiddish]] ''tov'' ("good", derived from the Hebrew טוב and with phonetic similarities to the Old German word for "Devil").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/15158/ |title=Spit Your Way To Safety: Toi, toi, toi! |publisher=Forward Association, Inc. |date=11 February  2009 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation sees "toi toi toi" as the onomatopoeic rendition of spitting three times.  Spitting three times over someone's head or shoulder is a gesture to ward off evil spirits. A similar-sounding expression for verbal spitting occurs in modern Hebrew as "Tfu, tfu" (here, only twice), which some say that Hebrew-speakers borrowed from Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/word-of-the-day/.premium-1.542077 |title= Word of the Day / Jook  ג׳וק A grisly load from Russian.|publisher= ''Haaretz'' online, 18 August 2013.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate operatic good luck charm, originating from [[Italy]], is the phrase "''[[In bocca al lupo (idiom)|in bocca al lupo!]]''" ("''In the mouth of the wolf''") with the response "''Crepi il lupo!''" ("''May the wolf die''")
(see ''Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Myth &amp; Legend'').

In [[Theatre of Australia|Australia]], the term "''chookas''" has been used also. According to one oral tradition, one of the performers would check audience numbers. If there were not many in the seats, the performers would have bread to eat following the performance. If the theatre was full they could then have "chooks"—Australian slang for [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]—for dinner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behindballet.com/ask-colin-chookas/ "Chookas!"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808013638/http://www.behindballet.com/ask-colin-chookas/ |date=8 August 2011 }}, By Colin Peasley, manager, Education Programme for The Australian Ballet
&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if it was a full house, the performer would call out "Chookas!" It is now used by performers prior to a show regardless of the number of patrons; and may be a wish for a successful turnout.

The '''cello''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|l|oʊ}} {{respell|CHEL|oh}}; plural '''cellos''' or '''celli''') or '''violoncello''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|v|aɪ|əl|ən|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|l|oʊ}} {{respell|VY|ə-lən|CHEL|oh}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/pronunciation/english/violoncello |title=violoncello noun – Pronunciation |website=Oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-it|vjolonˈtʃɛllo}}) is a [[string instrument]]. It is played by [[Bow (music)|bowing]] or [[pizzicato|plucking]] its four strings, which are usually [[intonation (music)|tuned]] in [[perfect fifth]]s an octave lower than the [[viola]]: from low to high, [[scientific pitch notation|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. It is the bass member of the [[violin family]], which also includes the [[violin]], viola and the [[double bass]], which doubles the bass line an octave lower than the cello in much of the orchestral repertoire. After the double bass, it is the second-largest and second lowest (in pitch) [[Bow (music)|bowed]] [[string instrument]] in the modern symphony orchestra. The cello is used as a solo instrument, as well as in [[chamber music]] ensembles (e.g., [[string quartet]]), [[string orchestra]]s, as a member of the [[string section]] of [[symphony orchestra]]s, most modern [[Chinese orchestra]]s, and some types of [[cello rock|rock bands]]. 

Music for the cello is generally written in the [[bass clef]], but both [[tenor clef]] and [[treble clef]] are used for higher-range parts, both in orchestral/chamber music parts and in solo cello works. A person who plays the cello is called a ''cellist'' or ''violoncellist''. In a small classical ensemble, such as a string quartet, the cello typically plays the [[bassline|bass part]], the lowest-pitched musical line of the piece. In an [[orchestra]] of the [[Baroque era]] (ca. 1600–1750) and [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (ca. 1725–1800), the cello typically plays the bass part, generally doubled an octave lower by the double basses. In Baroque-era music, the cello is often used to play the [[basso continuo]] bassline, typically along with a [[keyboard instrument]] (e.g., [[pipe organ]] or [[harpsichord]]) or a fretted, plucked stringed instrument (e.g., [[lute]] or [[theorbo]]). In such a Baroque performance, the cello player might be joined or replaced by other bass instruments, playing [[bassoon]], [[double bass]], [[viol]] or other low-register instruments.

==Etymology==
The name ''cello'' is derived from the ending of the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''violoncello'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/violoncello|title=Violoncello |publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means "little [[violone]]". The [[violone]] ("big viol") was the lowest-pitched instrument of the [[viol]] family, the group of stringed instruments that went out of fashion around the end of the 17th century in most countries except France, where they survived another half-century before the louder [[violin]] family came into greater favour in that country as well. In modern symphony orchestras, it is the second largest stringed instrument (the [[double bass]] is the largest). Thus, the name "violoncello" contained both the [[augmentative]] "''-one''" ("big") and the [[diminutive]] "''-cello''" ("little"). By the turn of the 20th century, it had become common to shorten the name to 'cello, with the apostrophe indicating the missing stem.&lt;ref name="countess"&gt;{{cite web|author=Delbanco, Nicholas|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108101905/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-70397117.html|title=The Countess of Stanlein Restored|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-70397117.html|publisher=Harper's Magazine|accessdate=4 October 2016|archivedate=January 8, 2009|date=January 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now customary to use "cello" without apostrophe as the full designation.&lt;ref name="countess"/&gt; ''Viol'' is derived from the root ''viola'', which was derived from [[Medieval Latin]] ''vitula'', meaning stringed instrument.

==Description==
[[File:Cello study.jpg|thumb|Cello close-up]]
[[File:Violoncello open strings.png|thumb|Cello open strings. {{audio|Violoncello open strings actual.mid|Play}}]]
Cellos are tuned in [[perfect fifth|fifths]], starting with [[Scientific pitch notation|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (two [[octave]]s below [[middle C]]), followed by G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and then A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is tuned in the same intervals as the [[viola]], but an octave lower. Unlike the [[violin]] or [[viola]] but similar to the [[double bass]], the cello has an [[endpin]] that rests on the floor to support the instrument's weight. The cello is most closely associated with [[Classical music|European classical music]], and has been described as the closest sounding instrument to the human voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Leyla Mamedova |author2=Isin Metin |author3=Nuran Ekici |author4=Murad Huseyinov |author5=Gulara Huseyinova |author6=Mehmet Kanter |title=An Ultrastructural Study on the Effects of Different Musical Timbres on the Skeletal Muscle Cells |journal=Asian Journal of Cell Biology |date=2007 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=43–49 |url=http://www.academicjournals.net/2/detail.php?id=2&amp;jid=ajcb&amp;theme=2&amp;issueno=4&amp;articleno=17 |accessdate=4 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207073731/http://www.academicjournals.net/2/detail.php?id=2&amp;jid=ajcb&amp;theme=2&amp;issueno=4&amp;articleno=17 |archivedate=7 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is a part of the standard [[orchestra]], as part of the [[string section]], and is the bass voice of the [[string quartet]] (although many composers give it a melodic role as well), as well as being part of many other [[chamber music|chamber]] groups.

Among the most well-known Baroque works for the cello are [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s six unaccompanied [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Suites]].  The cello possibly figures as a member of the  [[Figured bass|basso continuo]] group in chamber works by [[Francesca Caccini]] (1587–1641), [[Barbara Strozzi]] (1619–1677) with pieces such as ''Il primo libro di madrigali, per 2–5 voci e basso continuo, op. 1'' and  [[Élisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre|Elisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre]] (1665–1729) who wrote six sonatas for violin and basso continuo.

From the [[Classical music era|Classical era]], the two concertos by [[Joseph Haydn]] in [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Haydn)|C major]] and [[Cello Concerto No. 2 (Haydn)|D major]] stand out, as do the five sonatas for cello and pianoforte of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], which span the important three periods of his compositional evolution. A ''Divertimento for Piano, Clarinet, Viola and Cello'' is among the  surviving works by [[Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] (1739–1807).

A review of compositions for cello in the [[Romantic music era|Romantic era]] must include the German composer [[Fanny Mendelssohn]] (1805–1847) who wrote the Fantasy in G minor for cello and piano and a Capriccio in A-flat for cello.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--Who claims these are important or even well-known works?--&gt; Other well-known works of the era include the [[Robert Schumann]] [[Cello Concerto (Schumann)|Concerto]], the [[Antonín Dvořák]] [[Cello Concerto (Dvořák)|Concerto]] as well as the two sonatas and the [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Double Concerto]] by [[Johannes Brahms]].

Compositions from the late-19th and early 20th century include three cello sonatas (including the Cello Sonata in C Minor written in 1880) by [[Ethel Smyth|Dame Ethel Smyth]] (1858–1944),  [[Edward Elgar]]'s [[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|Cello Concerto in E minor]], [[Claude Debussy]]'s [[Cello Sonata (Debussy)|Sonata for Cello and Piano]], and unaccompanied cello sonatas by [[Zoltán Kodály]] and [[Paul Hindemith]].  Pieces including cello were written by [[American Music Center|American Music Cente]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; founder [[Marion Bauer]] (1882–1955)  (two trio sonatas for flute, cello and piano) and Ruth Crawford Seeger (1901–1953) (Diaphonic suite No. 2 for bassoon and cello).

Polish composer [[Grażyna Bacewicz]] (1909–1969) was writing for cello in the mid 20th century with Concerto No. 1 for Cello and Orchestra (1951), Concerto No. 2 for Cello and Orchestra (1963) and in 1964 composed her Quartet for four cellos. The cello's versatility made it popular with many male composers in this era as well, such as [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Witold Lutoslawski]] and [[Henri Dutilleux]].

Well-known cellists include [[Jacqueline du Pré|Jacqueline du Pre]], [[Raya Garbousova]], [[Zara Nelsova]], [[Hildur Guðnadóttir|Hildur Gudnadottir]], [[Han-na Chang|Han-Na Chang]], [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] and [[Beatrice Harrison]]. Others include [[Anner Bylsma]], [[Yo-Yo Ma]], [[Pablo Casals]], [[Julian Lloyd Webber]], [[Alfred Wallenstein]], [[Mischa Maisky]] and [[Gregor Piatigorsky]]. See the comprehensive list of [[List of cellists#A 2|cellists]] here.

In the 2010s, the instrument is found in [[popular music]], but was more commonly used in 1970s pop and [[disco]] music.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Today it is sometimes featured in [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rock music|rock]] recordings, examples of which are noted later in this article. The cello has also recently appeared in major [[hip-hop]] and [[R &amp; B]] performances, such as singers [[Rihanna]] and [[Ne-Yo]]'s performance at the [[American Music Awards]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The instrument has also been modified for [[Indian classical music]] by Nancy Lesh and [[Saskia Rao-de Haas]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Cello#cite note-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==History&lt;!--'Viola da spalla' redirects here--&gt;==
The [[viola da braccio|violin family]], including cello-sized instruments, emerged c. 1500 as family of instruments distinct from the [[viol|viola da gamba]] family. The earliest depictions of the violin family, from northern Italy c. 1530, show three sizes of instruments, roughly corresponding to what we now call [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, and cellos. Contrary to a popular misconception, the cello did not evolve from the viola da gamba, but existed alongside it for about two and a half centuries. The violin family is also known as the viola da braccio (meaning viola of the arm) family, a reference to the primary way the members of the family are held. This is to distinguish it from the viola da gamba (meaning viola of the leg) family, in which all the members are all held with the legs. The likely predecessors of the violin family include the [[lira da braccio]] and the [[rebec]]. The earliest surviving cellos are made by [[Andrea Amati]], the first known member of the celebrated [[Amati]] family of [[luthier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;.[http://collections.nmmusd.org/Cellos/Amati/Amaticello.html]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--The instrument described is clearly stated to have been a three-string bass, later cut down and remade into a cello.--&gt;

The direct ancestor to the violoncello was the [[bass violin]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Monteverdi referred to the instrument as "basso de viola da braccio" in ''Orfeo'' (1607). Although the first [[bass violin]], possibly invented as early as 1538, was most likely inspired by the viol, it was created to be used in consort with the violin. The bass violin was actually often referred to as a "''violone''", or "large viola", as were the viols of the same period. Instruments that share features with both the bass violin and the ''viola da gamba'' appear in Italian art of the early 16th century.

The invention of wire-wound [[String (music)|strings]] (fine wire around a thin gut core), around 1660 in [[Bologna]], allowed for a finer bass sound than was possible with purely gut strings on such a short body. Bolognese makers exploited this new technology to create the cello, a somewhat smaller instrument suitable for solo repertoire due to both the timbre of the instrument and the fact that the smaller size made it easier to play [[virtuoso|virtuosic]] passages.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} This instrument had disadvantages as well, however. The cello's light sound was not as suitable for church and ensemble playing, so it had to be doubled by [[organ (music)|organ]], [[theorbo]] or [[violone]].

Around 1700, Italian players popularized the cello in northern Europe, although the bass violin (basse de violon) continued to be used for another two decades in France.{{citation needed|date=November 2007}}&lt;!--I believe you, I would just like to know where you got the info--&gt; Many existing bass violins were literally cut down in size to convert them into cellos according to the smaller pattern developed by [[Stradivarius]], who also made a number of old pattern large cellos (the 'Servais').&lt;ref name="vrzuok" &gt;{{Cite journal|last= Cyr |first= Mary |title= Basses and basse continue in the Orchestra of the Paris Opéra 1700–1764 |journal= Early Music |volume= X |issue= Apr., 1982 |pages= 155–170 |doi=10.1093/earlyj/10.2.155|ref=harv }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The sizes, names, and tunings of the cello varied widely by geography and time.&lt;ref name="vrzuok"/&gt; The size was not standardized until around 1750.

Despite similarities to the [[viol|viola da gamba]], the cello is actually part of the [[viola da braccio]] family, meaning "viol of the arm", which includes, among others, the [[violin]] and [[viola]]. Though paintings like [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Bruegel]]'s "The Rustic Wedding", and [[Philibert Jambe de Fer|Jambe de Fer]] in his ''Epitome Musical'' suggest that the bass violin had alternate playing positions, these were short-lived and the more practical and ergonomic ''a gamba'' position eventually replaced them entirely.

[[File:Cello strung gut.JPG|thumb|right|A baroque cello strung with gut strings. Note the absence of fine-tuning pins on the tailpiece.]]
[[Baroque]]-era cellos differed from the modern instrument in several ways. The neck has a different form and angle, which matches the baroque bass-bar and stringing.{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--What?!--&gt; Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound through the floor),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theclassymusician.com/blog/the-endpin |title=The Endpin – The Classy Musician |website=Theclassymusician.com |date=March 7, 2016  |author=Marsh, Gregory and Elizabeth |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the [[Bow frog|frog]]; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings normally have a metal core, although some use a synthetic core; Baroque strings are made of [[Catgut|gut]], with the G and C strings wire-wound. Modern cellos often have fine-tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece, which make it much easier to tune the instrument, but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on Baroque cellos. Overall, the modern instrument has much higher string tension than the Baroque cello,{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} resulting in a louder, more projecting tone, with fewer overtones.

Few educational works specifically devoted to the cello existed before the 18th century, and those that do exist contain little value to the performer beyond simple accounts of instrumental technique. One of the earliest cello manuals is [[Michel Corrette]]'s ''Méthode, thèorique et pratique pour apprendre en peu de temps le violoncelle dans sa perfection'' (Paris, 1741).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cello.org/heaven/wasiel/18italy.htm |title=Cello Playing in 18th Century Italy |website=Cello.org |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==

===Orchestral===
[[File:FHM-Orchestra-mk2006-03.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The cello section of the orchestra of the Munich University of Applied Sciences is shown here.]]
Cellos are part of the standard [[orchestra|symphony orchestra]], which usually includes eight to twelve cello players. The cello section, in standard orchestral seating, is located on stage left (the audience's right) in the front, opposite the first violin section. However, some orchestras and conductors prefer switching the positioning of the viola and cello sections. The ''principal'' cellist is the section leader, determining bowings for the section in conjunction with other string principals, playing solos and leading entrances (when the section begins to play its part). Principal players always sit closest to the audience.

The cellos are a critical part of orchestral music; all symphonic works involve the cello section, and many pieces require cello soli or solos. Much of the time, cellos provide part of the low-register harmony for the orchestra. Often, the cello section plays the melody for a brief period, before returning to the harmony role. There are also cello [[concerto]]s, which are orchestral pieces that feature a solo cellist accompanied by an entire orchestra.

===Solo===
There are numerous [[cello concerto]]s – where a solo cello is accompanied by an [[orchestra]] – notably 25 by [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], 12 by [[Luigi Boccherini|Boccherini]], at least 3 by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], 3 by [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;E. Bach]], 2 by [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], 2 by Dvořák, and one each by Robert Schumann], [[Édouard Lalo|Lalo]], and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]. There were also some cellists who, while not otherwise composers, did write cello-specific repertoire, such as [[Nikolaus Kraft]] who wrote six cello concertos. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] for Cello, Violin and Piano and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]' [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Double Concerto]] for Cello and Violin are also part of the concertante repertoire although in both cases the cello shares solo duties with at least one other instrument. Moreover, several composers wrote large-scale pieces for cello and orchestra, which are concertos in all but name. Some familiar "concertos" are [[Richard Strauss]]' [[tone poem]] ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'', [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'', [[Ernest Bloch|Bloch]]'s ''[[Schelomo]]'' and [[Max Bruch|Bruch]]'s ''[[Kol Nidrei (Bruch)|Kol Nidrei]]''.

In the 20th century, the cello repertoire grew immensely. This was partly due to the influence of virtuoso cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who inspired, commissioned and premiered dozens of new works. Among these, Prokofiev's ''[[Symphony-Concerto (Prokofiev)|Symphony-Concerto]]'', [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]]'s ''[[Cello Symphony]]'', the concertos of Shostakovich and Lutosławski as well as Dutilleux's ''[[Tout un monde lointain...]]'' have already become part of the standard repertoire. Other major composers who wrote concertante works for him include [[Olivier Messiaen|Messiaen]], [[André Jolivet|Jolivet]], [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]]. In addition, [[Malcolm Arnold|Arnold]], [[Samuel Barber|Barber]], [[Philip Glass|Glass]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], [[Arthur Honegger|Honegger]], Ligeti, [[Nikolai Myaskovsky|Myaskovsky]], Penderecki, [[Joaquín Rodrigo|Rodrigo]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos|Villa-Lobos]] and [[William Walton|Walton]] also wrote major [[List of compositions for cello and orchestra|concertos]] for other cellists, notably for [[Gaspar Cassadó]], [[Aldo Parisot]], Gregor Piatigorsky, [[Siegfried Palm]] and [[Julian Lloyd Webber]].

There are also many [[cello sonata|sonatas]] for cello and [[piano]]. Those written by [[Beethoven]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Brahms]], [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], Shostakovich, Prokofiev, [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], [[Elliott Carter|Carter]], and [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]] are particularly well known.

Other important pieces for cello and piano include Schumann's five ''Stücke im Volkston'' and transcriptions like [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s [[Arpeggione Sonata]] (originally for [[arpeggione]] and piano), [[César Franck]]'s [[Cello Sonata (Franck/Delsart)|Cello Sonata]] (originally a violin sonata, transcribed by [[Jules Delsart]] with the composer's approval), [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)#Suite italienne|Suite italienne]]'' (transcribed by the composer – with Gregor Piatigorsky – from his ballet ''Pulcinella'') and [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]]'s first rhapsody (also transcribed by the composer, originally for violin and piano).

There are pieces for [[List of solo cello pieces|cello solo]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.&amp;nbsp;S. Bach]]'s six [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Suites for Cello]] (which are among the best-known solo cello pieces), [[Zoltán Kodály|Kodály]]'s [[Sonata for Solo Cello (Kodály)|Sonata for Solo Cello]] and Britten's three [[Cello Suites (Britten)|Cello Suites]]. Other notable examples include [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]]'s and [[Eugène Ysaÿe|Ysaÿe]]'s Sonatas for Solo Cello, Dutilleux's ''Trois Strophes sur le Nom de Sacher'', Berio's ''Les Mots Sont Allés'', [[Gaspar Cassadó|Cassadó]]'s Suite for Solo Cello, Ligeti's [[Sonata for Solo Cello (Ligeti)|Solo Sonata]], Carter's two ''Figment''s and [[Iannis Xenakis|Xenakis]]' ''[[Nomos Alpha]]'' and ''Kottos''.

===Quartets and other ensembles===
The cello is a member of the traditional [[string quartet]] as well as [[string quintets]], [[string sextet|sextet]] or [[string trio|trios]] and other mixed ensembles.
There are also pieces written for two, three, four or more cellos; this type of ensemble is also called a "cello choir" and its sound is familiar from the introduction to [[Rossini]]'s [[William Tell Overture]] as well as Zaccharia's prayer scene in [[Verdi]]'s [[Nabucco]]. [[Tchaikovsky]]'s [[1812 Overture]] also starts with a cello ensemble, with four cellos playing the top lines and two violas playing the bass lines.  As a self-sufficient ensemble, its most famous repertoire is [[Villa-Lobos]]' first of his [[Bachianas Brasileiras]] for cello ensemble (the fifth is for soprano and 8 cellos). Other examples are [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s cello duets, quartet, and sextet, [[Pärt]]'s [[Fratres]] for 8 cellos and [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]]' ''Messagesquisse'' for 7 cellos, or even Villa-Lobos' rarely played ''Fantasia Concertante'' (1958) for 32 cellos. The 12 cellists of the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] (or "the Twelve" as they have since taken to being called) specialize in this repertoire and have commissioned many works, including arrangements of well-known popular songs.

===Popular music, jazz, world music and neoclassical===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
[[File:Apocalyptica - Ilosaarirock 2009.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Apocalyptica]] at the 2009 [[Ilosaarirock]] festival.]]
The cello is less common in [[popular music]] than in classical music. Several bands feature a cello in their standard line-up, e.g. Joe Kwon of [[The Avett Brothers]]. The more common use in [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rock music|rock]] is to bring the instrument in for a particular song. In the 1960s, artists such as [[the Beatles]] and [[Cher]] used the cello in popular music, in songs such as The Beatles' "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]", "[[Eleanor Rigby]]" and "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]", and Cher's "[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]". "[[Good Vibrations]]" by [[the Beach Boys]] includes the cello in its instrumental ensemble, which includes a number of instruments unusual for this sort of music. Bass guitarist [[Jack Bruce]], who had  originally studied music on a performance scholarship for cello, played a prominent cello part in "As You Said" on [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s ''[[Wheels of Fire]]'' studio album (1968).

In the 1970s, the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] enjoyed great commercial success taking inspiration from so-called "Beatlesque" arrangements, adding the cello (and violin) to the standard rock combo line-up and in 1978 the UK based rock band, [[Colosseum II]], collaborated with cellist Julian Lloyd Webber on the recording ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]''. Most notably, [[Pink Floyd]] included a cello solo in their 1970 epic instrumental "[[Atom Heart Mother (suite)|Atom Heart Mother]]". Bass guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]] of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] was originally a cellist and included some cello parts in their ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'' album.

Established non-traditional cello groups include [[Apocalyptica]], a group of Finnish cellists best known for their versions of [[Metallica]] songs, [[Rasputina (band)|Rasputina]], a group of cellists committed to an intricate cello style intermingled with Gothic music, the [[Massive Violins]], an ensemble of seven singing cellists known for their arrangements of rock, pop and classical hits, Von Cello, a cello fronted rock power trio, [[Break of Reality]] who mix elements of classical music with the more modern rock and metal genre, [[Cello Fury]], a cello rock band that performs original rock/classical crossover music, and Jelloslave, a Minneapolis-based Cello duo with two percussionists. These groups are examples of a style that has become known as [[cello rock]]. The crossover string quartet [[Bond (band)|bond]] also includes a cellist. Silenzium and Cellissimo Quartet are [[Russia]]n (Novosibirsk) groups playing rock and metal and having more and more popularity in [[Siberia]]. [[Cold Fairyland]] from [[Shanghai]], [[China]] is using a cello along a [[Pipa]] as the main solo instrument to create East meets West progressive (folk) rock.

More recent bands using the cello are [[Aerosmith]], [[The Auteurs]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[James (band)|James]], [[Talk Talk]], [[Phillip Phillips]], [[OneRepublic]], and the [[baroque rock]] band [[Arcade Fire]]. An Atlanta-based trio, King Richard's Sunday Best, also uses a cellist in their lineup. So-called "chamber pop" artists like [[Kronos Quartet]], The Vitamin String Quartet and Margot and the Nuclear So and So's have also recently made cello common in modern alternative rock. Heavy metal band [[System of a Down]] has also made use of the cello's rich sound. The indie rock band [[The Stiletto Formal]] are known for using a cello as a major staple of their sound, similarly, the indie rock band [[Canada (music group)|Canada]] employs two cello players in their lineup. The orch-rock group, [[The Polyphonic Spree]], which has pioneered the use of stringed and symphonic instruments, employs the cello in very creative ways for many of their "[[psychedelia|psychedelic]]-esque" melodies. The first wave [[screamo]] band ''I Would Set Myself On Fire For You'' featured a cello as well as a viola to create a more [[Folk music|folk]]-oriented sound. The band, [[Panic! at the Disco]] uses a cello in their song, "Build God, Then We'll Talk". The lead vocalist of the band, [[Brendon Urie]], also did the recording of the cello solo. [[The Lumineers]] added cellist Nela Pekarek to the band in 2010. She plays cello, sings harmony and duets.

In [[jazz]], bassists [[Oscar Pettiford]] and [[Harry Babasin]] were among the first to use the cello as a solo instrument; both tuned their instrument in fourths, an octave above the double bass. [[Fred Katz (cellist)|Fred Katz]] (who was not a bassist) was one of the first notable jazz cellists to use the instrument's standard tuning and arco technique. Contemporary jazz cellists include [[Abdul Wadud (musician)|Abdul Wadud]], [[Diedre Murray]], [[Ron Carter]], [[Dave Holland]], [[David Darling (musician)|David Darling]], [[Lucio Amanti]], Akua Dixon, [[Ernst Reijseger]], [[Fred Lonberg-Holm]], [[Tom Cora]] and [[Erik Friedlander]]. Modern musical theatre pieces like Jason Robert Brown's [[The Last Five Years]], Duncan Sheik's [[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]], Adam Guettel's [[Floyd Collins (musical)|Floyd Collins]], and Ricky Ian Gordon's [[My Life with Albertine]] use small string ensembles (including solo cellos) to a prominent extent.

In Indian Classical music [[Saskia Rao-de Haas]] is a well established soloist as well as playing duets with her sitarist husband Pt. [[Shubhendra Rao]]. Other cellists performing Indian classical music are: Nancy Lesh (Dhrupad) and Anup Biswas. Both Rao and Lesh play the cello sitting cross-legged on the floor.

The cello can also be used in [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[folk music]], with notable players including [[Ben Sollee]] of the [[Sparrow Quartet]] and the "Cajun cellist" Sean Grissom, as well as [[Vyvienne Long]] who, in addition to her own projects, has played for those of [[Damien Rice]]. Cellists such as [[Natalie Haas]], Abby Newton and Liz Davis Maxfield have contributed significantly to the use of cello playing in Celtic folk music, often with the cello featured as a primary melodic instrument and employing the skills and techniques of traditional fiddle playing. [[Lindsay Mac]] is becoming well known for playing the cello like a guitar, with her cover of [[The Beatles]]' "[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]".

==Construction==
[[File:Cello Parts.jpg|thumb|Main parts of the cello|230px]]
The cello is typically made from carved wood, although other materials such as [[carbon fiber]] or aluminum may be used. A traditional cello has a [[spruce]] top, with [[maple]] for the back, sides, and neck. Other woods, such as [[Populus|poplar]] or [[willow]], are sometimes used for the back and sides. Less expensive cellos frequently have tops and backs made of [[Plywood|laminated wood]]. Laminated cellos are widely used in elementary and secondary school orchestras and [[youth orchestra]]s, because they are much more durable than carved wood cellos (i.e., they are less likely to crack if bumped or dropped) and they are much less expensive.

The top and back are traditionally hand-carved, though less expensive cellos are often machine-produced. The sides, or ribs, are made by heating the wood and bending it around forms. The cello body has a wide top bout, narrow middle formed by two C-bouts, and wide bottom bout, with the [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] and [[F holes]] just below the middle. The top and back of the cello has decorative border inlay known as [[purfling]]. While purfling is attractive, it is also functional: if the instrument is struck, the purfling can prevent cracking of the wood. A crack may form at the rim of the instrument, but spreads no further. Without purfling, cracks can spread up or down the top or back. Playing, traveling and the weather all affect the cello and can increase a crack if purfling is not in place. Less expensive instruments typically have painted purfling.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Alternative materials===
Cello manufacturer [[Luis and Clark|Luis &amp; Clark]] constructs cellos from [[carbon fibre]]. Carbon fibre instruments are particularly suitable for outdoor playing because of the strength of the material and its resistance to humidity and temperature fluctuations. Luis &amp; Clark has produced over 1000 cellos, some of which are owned by cellists such as Yo-Yo Ma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/arts/music/19carb.html?_r=0 |title=Cold Case: Luis and Clark Carbon Expedition for Yo-Yo Ma? |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 18, 2009 |author=Chris Museler |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Josephine van Lier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van Lier|first1=Josephine|title=Luis and Clark Carbon Fibre Cells|url=http://www.albertastringassociation.ca/docs/ASANewsletterSummer2006.pdf|website=Alberta String Association|accessdate=4 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407090955/http://www.albertastringassociation.ca/docs/ASANewsletterSummer2006.pdf|archivedate=April 7, 2014|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) as well as German luthier G.A. Pfretzschner produced an unknown number of aluminum cellos (in addition to aluminum double basses and violins).

===Neck, fingerboard, pegbox, and scroll===
Above the main body is the carved neck. The neck has a curved cross-section on its underside, which is where the player's thumb runs along the neck during playing. The neck which leads to a [[pegbox]] and the [[scroll (music)|scroll]]. The neck, pegbox, and scroll are normally carved out of a single piece of wood, usually [[maple]]. The [[fingerboard]] is glued to the neck and extends over the body of the instrument. The fingerboard is given a curved shape, matching the curve on the bridge. Both the fingerboard and bridge need to be curved so that the performer can bow individual strings. If the cello were to have a flat fingerboard and bridge, as with a typical guitar, the performer would only be able to bow the "outer" two strings or bow all the strings. The performer would not be able to play the "inner" two strings alone.

The [[Nut (instrumental)|nut]] is a raised piece of wood, fitted where the fingerboard meets the pegbox, in which the strings rest in shallow slots or grooves to keep them the correct distance apart. The pegbox houses four tapered [[tuning peg]]s, one for each string. The pegs are used to tune the cello by either tightening or loosening the string. The pegs are called "friction pegs", because they maintain their position by friction. The scroll is a traditional ornamental part of the cello and a feature of all other members of the [[violin family]]. [[Ebony]] is usually used for the tuning pegs, fingerboard, and nut, but other hardwoods, such as [[Buxus|boxwood]] or [[rosewood]], can be used. Black fittings on low-cost instruments are often made from inexpensive wood that has been blackened or "ebonized" to look like [[ebony]], which is much harder and more expensive. Ebonised parts such as tuning pegs may crack or split, and the black surface of the fingerboard will eventually wear down to reveal the lighter wood underneath.

===Strings===
Historically, cello [[String (music)|strings]] had cores made out of [[catgut]], which, despite its name is made from sheep or goat intestines which are dried out. Most modern strings used in the 2010s are wound with metallic materials like [[aluminum]], [[titanium]] and [[chromium]]. Cellists may mix different types of strings on their instruments. The pitches of the open strings are C, G, D, and A (black note heads in the playing range figure above), unless alternative tuning ([[scordatura]]) is specified by the composer. Some composers (e.g. [[Ottorino Respighi]] in the final movement of ‘’[[The Pines of Rome]]’’) ask that the low C be tuned down to a B{{Music|b}} or B so that the performer can play a different low note on the lowest open string.

===Tailpiece and endpin===
The [[tailpiece]] and [[endpin]] are found in the lower part of the cello. The tailpiece is the part of the cello to which the "ball ends" of the strings are attached by passing them through holes. The tailpiece is attached to the bottom of the cello. The tailpiece is traditionally made of [[ebony]] or another hard wood, but can also be made of [[plastic]] or [[steel]] on lower-cost instruments. It attaches the strings to the lower end of the cello, and can have one or more fine tuners. The fine tuners are used to make smaller adjustments to the pitch of the string. The fine tuners can increase the tension of each string (raising the pitch) or decrease the tension of the string (lowering the pitch). When the performer is putting on a new string, the fine tuner for that string is normally reset to a middle position, and then the peg is turned to bring the string up to pitch. The fine turners are used for subtle, minor adjustments to pitch, such as tuning a cello to the oboe's 440&amp;nbsp;Hz A note or to tune the cello to a piano.

The endpin or spike is made of wood, metal or rigid carbon fibre and supports the cello in playing position. The endpin can be retracted into the hollow body of the instrument when the cello is being transported in its case. This makes the cello easier to move about. When the performer wishes to play the cello, the endpin is pulled out to lengthen it. The endpin is locked into the player's preferred length with a screw mechanism. The adjustable nature of endpins enables performers of different ages and body sizes to adjust the endpin length to suit them.  In the Baroque period the cello was held between the calves, as there was no endpin at that time. The endpin was "introduced by Adrien Servais {{circa}} 1845 to give the instrument greater stability".&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stowell|first=Robin|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Cello|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvlhQgAACAAJ|date=June 28, 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern endpins are retractable and adjustable; older ones were removed when not in use. (The word "endpin" sometimes also refers to the button of wood located at this place in all instruments in the violin family, but this is usually called "tailpin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/stringed-instrument |title=Stringed instrument |website=britannica.com |author=Eric Halfpenny |author2=Theodore C Grame |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The sharp tip of the cello's endpin is sometimes capped with a rubber tip that protects the tip from dulling and prevents the cello from slipping on the floor. Many cellists use a rubber pad with a metal cup to keep the tip from slipping on the floor. A number of accessories to keep the endpin from slipping; these include ropes which attach to the chair leg and other devices.

===Bridge and f-holes===
[[File:Cello bridge2.JPG|right|thumb|The bridge of a cello, with a mute (the mute is not in use)]]
The [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] holds the strings above the cello and transfers their vibrations to the top of the instrument and the soundpost inside (see below). The bridge is not glued, but rather held in place by the tension of the strings. The bridge is usually positioned by the cross point of the "f-hole" (i.e., where the horizontal line occurs in the "f"). The [[sound-hole|f-holes]], named for their shape, are located on either side of the bridge, and allow air to move in and out of the instrument as part of the sound-production process.  They probably actually stand for an old style medial S, for words related to Sound.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The f-holes also act as access points to the interior of the cello for repairs or maintenance. Sometimes a small length of rubber hose containing a water-soaked sponge, called a Dampit, is inserted through the f-holes, and serves as a humidifier. This keeps the wood components of the cello from drying out.

===Internal features===
Internally, the cello has two important features: a [[bass bar]], which is glued to the underside of the top of the instrument, and a round wooden [[sound post]], a solid wooden cylinder which is wedged between the top and bottom plates. The bass bar, found under the bass foot of the bridge, serves to support the cello's top and distribute the vibrations from the strings to the body of the instrument. The sound post, found under the treble side of the bridge, connects the back and front of the cello. Like the bridge, the sound post is not glued, but is kept in place by the tensions of the bridge and strings. Together, the bass bar and sound post transfer the strings' vibrations to the top (front) of the instrument (and to a lesser extent the back), acting as a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] to produce the instrument's sound.

===Glue===
Cellos are constructed and repaired using [[hide glue]], which is strong but reversible, allowing for disassembly when needed. Tops may be glued on with diluted glue, since some repairs call for the removal of the top. Theoretically, hide glue is weaker than the body's wood, so as the top or back shrinks side-to-side, the glue holding it lets go, so the plate does not crack. Cellists repairing cracks in their cello do not use regular [[wood glue]], because it cannot be steamed open when a repair has to be made by a [[luthier]].

===Bow===
[[File:Bow hand Violoncello.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|A cello French bow&lt;ref&gt;As opposed to the German bow popular in baroque era, held underhand.&lt;/ref&gt; ''sul ponticello'']]
Traditionally, [[bow (music)|bows]] are made from [[Paubrasilia|pernambuco]] or [[brazilwood]]. Both come from the same species of tree (''Caesalpinia echinata''), but pernambuco, used for higher-quality bows, is the heartwood of the tree and is darker in color than brazilwood (which is sometimes stained to compensate). Pernambuco is a heavy, resinous wood with great elasticity, &lt;!--and high sound velocity--&gt;which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows. Horsehair is stretched out between the two ends of the bow. The taut horsehair is drawn over the strings to produce the cello's characteristic tone. A small knob is twisted to increase or decrease the tension of the horsehair. The tension on the bow is released when the instrument is not being used. The amount of tension a cellist puts on the bow hair depends on the preferences of the player, the style of music being played, and for students, the preferences of their teacher.

Bows are also made from other materials, such as carbon-fibre—stronger than wood—and fiberglass (often used to make inexpensive, lower-quality student bows). An average cello bow is {{convert|73|cm|in|abbr=on}} long (shorter than a violin or viola bow) {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} high (from the frog to the stick) and {{convert|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The frog of a cello bow typically has a rounded corner like that of a viola bow, but is wider. A cello bow is roughly {{convert|10|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier than a viola bow, which in turn is roughly {{convert|10|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier than a violin bow. &lt;!-- for example, see http://www.codabow.com/info_buyfirstbow.html --&gt;

Bow hair is traditionally [[horsehair]], though synthetic hair, in varying colors, is also used. Prior to playing, the musician tightens the bow by turning a screw to pull the frog (the part of the bow under the hand) back, and increase the tension of the hair. [[Rosin]] is applied by the player to make the hairs sticky. Bows need to be re-haired periodically. [[Baroque]] style (1600–1750) cello bows were much thicker and were formed with a larger outward arch when compared to modern cello bows. The inward arch of a modern cello bow produces greater tension, which in turn gives off a louder sound.

The cello bow has also been used to play [[electric guitar]]s. Jimmy Page pioneered its application on tracks such as "[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]". The [[post-rock]] [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] band [[Sigur Rós]]'s lead singer often plays a guitar using a cello bow.

In 1989, the German cellist [[Michael Bach (musician)|Michael Bach]] began developing a [[curved bow]], encouraged by [[John Cage]], [[Dieter Schnebel]], Mstislav Rostropovich and [[Luigi Colani]]: and since then many pieces have been composed especially for it. This curved bow (''BACH.Bow'') is a convex curved bow which, unlike the ordinary bow, renders possible polyphonic playing on the various strings of the instrument. The solo repertoire for violin and cello by J. S. Bach the BACH.Bow is particularly suited to it: and it was developed with this in mind, polyphonic playing being required, as well as monophonic.

==Physics==

===Physical aspects===
When a string is bowed or plucked, it vibrates and moves the air around it, producing sound waves. Because the string is quite thin, not much air is moved by the string itself, and consequently if the string was not mounted on a hollow body, the sound would be weak. In acoustic stringed instruments such as the cello, this lack of volume is solved by mounting the vibrating string on a larger hollow wooden body. The vibrations are transmitted to the larger body, which can move more air and produce a louder sound. Different designs of the instrument produces variations in the instrument’s vibrational patterns and thus changes the character of the sound produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowling|first=Elizabeth|title=The cello|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=46gXAQAAIAAJ|year=1983|publisher=C. Scribner's Sons|isbn=978-0-684-17870-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A string’s fundamental pitch can be adjusted by changing its stiffness, which depends on tension and length. Tightening a string stiffens it by increasing both the outward forces along its length and the net forces it experiences during a distortion.&lt;ref name="Bloomfield, Louis A 2001. pp 241-244"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloomfield|first=Louis|title=How things work: the physics of everyday life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tgUvAQAAIAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-38151-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cello can be tuned by adjusting the tension of its strings, by turning the tuning pegs mounted on its pegbox, and tension adjusters (fine tuners) on the tail piece.

A string’s length also affects its fundamental pitch. Shortening a string stiffens it by increasing its curvature during a distortion and subjecting it to larger net forces. Shortening the string also reduces its mass,  but does not alter the mass per unit length,  and it is the latter ratio rather than the total mass which governs the frequency.   The string vibrates in a standing wave whose speed of propagation is given by {{sqrt|''T''/''m''}},  where ''T'' is the tension and ''m'' is the mass per unit length;    there is a node at either end of the vibrating length,  and thus the vibrating length ''l'' is half a wavelength.    Since the frequency of any wave is equal to the speed divided by the wavelength,  we have frequency = {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|2''l''}} × {{sqrt|''T''/''m''}}}}.   (Note that some writers,  including Muncaster (cited below) use the Greek letter ''μ'' in place of ''m''.) Thus shortening a string increases the frequency,  and thus the pitch. Because of this effect, you can raise and change the pitch of a string by pressing it against the fingerboard in the cello’s neck and effectively shortening it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muncaster|first=Roger|title=A-level Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Knov8XAyf2cC|year=1993|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-1584-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise strings with less mass per unit length,  if under the same tension,  will have a higher frequency and thus higher pitch than more massive strings.   This is a prime reason why the different strings on all string instruments have different fundamental pitches,  with the lightest strings having the highest pitches.

A played note of E or F{{music|#}} has a frequency which is often very close to the natural resonating frequency of the body of the instrument,  and if the problem is not addressed this can set the body into near resonance.   This may cause an unpleasant sudden amplification of this pitch,  and additionally a loud beating sound results from the interference produced between these nearby frequencies; this is known as the “[[wolf tone]]” because it is an unpleasant growling sound. The wood resonance appears to be split into two frequencies by the driving force of the sounding string. These two periodic resonances beat with each other. This wolf tone must be eliminated or significantly reduced for the cello to play the nearby notes with a pleasant tone. This can be accomplished by modifying the cello front plate, attaching a wolf eliminator (a metal cylinder or a rubber cylinder encased in metal), or moving the sound post.&lt;ref name="Berg, Richard E 2005. pp 314, 329"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=Richard E.|last2=Stork|first2=David G.|title=The Physics of Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4FpgQgAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-145789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a string is bowed or plucked to produce a note, the fundamental note is accompanied by higher frequency overtones. Each sound has a particular recipe of frequencies that combine to make the total sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chattopadhyay|first=D.|title=Elements Of Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eA7g3aXePRoC|date=January 1, 2004|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-81-224-1538-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing technique==
{{main|Cello technique}}
[[File:Cello KSG 9829 PK.jpg|thumb|A cellist]]
Playing the cello is done while seated with the instrument supported on the floor by the endpin. The left hand fingertips stop the strings on the fingerboard, determining the pitch of the fingered note. The right hand plucks or bows the strings to sound the notes. The left hand fingertips stop the strings along their length, determining the pitch of each fingered note. Stopping the string closer to the bridge results in  higher-pitched sound, because the vibrating string length has been shortened. In the ''neck'' positions (which use just less than half of the fingerboard, nearest the top of the instrument), the thumb rests on the back of the neck; in ''[[thumb position]]'' (a general name for notes on the remainder of the fingerboard) the thumb usually rests alongside the fingers on the string and the side of the thumb is used to play notes. The fingers are normally held curved with each knuckle bent, with the fingertips in contact with the string. If a finger is required on two (or more) strings at once to play perfect fifths (in double stops or chords) it is used flat. In slower, or more expressive playing, the contact point can move slightly away from the nail to the pad of the finger, allowing a fuller vibrato.

[[Vibrato]] is a small oscillation in the pitch of a note, usually considered expressive. [[Harmonics]] played on the cello fall into two classes; natural and artificial. Natural harmonics are produced by lightly touching (but not depressing) the string with the finger at certain places, and then bowing (or, rarely, plucking) the string. For example, the halfway point of the string will produce a harmonic that is one octave above the unfingered (open) string. Natural harmonics only produce notes that are part of the [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] on a particular string. Artificial harmonics (also called false harmonics or stopped harmonics), in which the player depresses the string fully with one finger while touching the same string lightly with another finger, can produce any note above middle C. 
[[Glissando]] (Italian for "sliding") is an effect played by sliding the finger up or down the fingerboard without releasing the string. This causes the pitch to rise and fall smoothly, without separate, discernible steps.

In cello playing, the bow is much like the breath of a [[wind instrument]] player. Arguably, it is the major determinant in the expressiveness of the playing. The right hand holds the bow and controls the duration and character of the notes. The bow is drawn across the strings roughly halfway between the end of the [[fingerboard]] and the bridge, in a direction perpendicular to the strings. The bow is held with all five fingers of the right hand, the thumb opposite the fingers and closer to the cellist's body. Tone production and volume of sound depend on a combination of several factors. The three most important ones are: bow speed, weight applied to the string, and point of contact of the bow hair with the string.

[[Double stop]]s involve the playing of two notes at the same time. Two strings are fingered simultaneously, and the bow is drawn so as to sound them both at once. In [[pizzicato]] playing, the string is plucked directly with the fingers or thumb. Pizzicato is often abbreviated as "Pizz.". Position of the hand is slightly over the finger board and away from the bridge.

A player using the [[col legno]] technique strikes or rubs the strings with the wood of the bow rather than the hair. In [[spiccato]] playing, the strings are not "drawn" by the bow hair but struck by it, while still retaining some horizontal motion, to generate a more percussive, crisp sound. In [[staccato]], the player moves the bow a small distance and stops it on the string, making a short sound, the rest of the written duration being taken up by silence. 
[[Legato]] is a technique where the notes are smoothly connected without accents or breaks. It is noted by a slur (curved line) above or below – depending on their position on the staff – the notes of the passage that is to be played legato.

''Sul ponticello'' ("on the bridge") refers to bowing closer to the bridge, while ''sul tasto'' ("on the fingerboard") calls for bowing nearer the end of the fingerboard. Sul tasto produces a more flute-like sound, with more emphasis on the fundamental frequency of the note, and softer overtones.

==Sizes==
[[File:Full size and fractional cello.jpg|thumb|{{frac|1|8}} size cello with full size cello]]
Standard-sized cellos are referred to as "full-size" or "{{frac|4|4}}" but are also made in smaller (fractional) sizes (e.g. {{frac|7|8}}, {{frac|3|4}}, {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|1|8}}, {{frac|1|10}}, {{frac|1|16}}). The fractions refer to volume rather than length, so a 1/2 size cello is much longer than half the length of a full size.  The smaller cellos are identical to standard cellos in construction, range, and usage, but are simply scaled-down for the benefit of children and shorter adults.

Cellos in sizes larger than {{frac|4|4}} do exist, and cellists with unusually large hands may require such a non-standard instrument. Cellos made before approximately 1700 tended to be considerably larger than those made and commonly played today. Around 1680, changes in string-making technology made it possible to play lower-pitched notes on shorter strings. The cellos of [[Stradivari]], for example, can be clearly divided into two models: the style made before 1702, characterized by larger instruments (of which only three exist in their original size and configuration), and the style made during and after 1707, when Stradivari began making smaller cellos. This later model is the design most commonly used by modern luthiers. The [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]] of a {{frac|4|4}} cello is about {{convert|27+1/2|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}}. The new size offered fuller tonal projection and greater range of expression. The instrument in this form was able to contribute to more pieces musically and offered the possibility of greater physical dexterity for the player to develop technique.&lt;ref name="size"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stowell|first=Robin|title=The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bJAZU27hWEC|date=November 13, 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00042-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accessories==
There are many accessories for the cello.
*Cases are used to protect the cello and bow (or multiple bows).
[[File:Rosins.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Rosin is applied to bow hairs to increase the "bite" of the bow on the strings.]]
*[[Rosin]], made from [[Pinophyta|conifer]] [[resin]], is applied to the bow hairs to increase the effectiveness of the friction, grip or bite, and allow proper sound production. Rosin may have additives to modify the friction such as beeswax, gold, silver or tin. Commonly, rosins are classified as either Dark or Light.
*[[Endpin]] stops or straps (tradenames include Rockstop and Black Hole) keep the cello from sliding if the endpin does not have a rubber piece on the end, or if a floor is particularly slippery.
*[[Wolf tone eliminator]]s are placed on cello strings between the tailpiece and the bridge to eliminate acoustic anomalies known as [[wolf tone]]s or "wolfs".
*[[Mute (music)#String|Mutes]] are used to change the sound of the cello by reducing [[overtones]] and to reduce the amount of noise produced by the instrument by preventing the bridge vibrating as much.
[[File:Wolf tone eliminator.jpg|thumb|150px|A brass wolf tone eliminator typically placed on the G string (second string from the left) of a cello, between the bridge and the tailpiece. (The black rubber piece on the D string (third from the left) is a [[mute (music)|mute]].)]]
*[[Metronome]]s provide a steady [[tempo]] by sounding out a certain number of beats per minute.

==Instrument makers==
{{Main|Luthier}}
Cellos are made by [[luthier]]s, specialists in building and repairing stringed instruments, ranging from guitars to violins. The following luthiers are notable for the cellos they have produced:
*[[Nicolò Amati]] and others in the Amati family
*[[Nicolò Gagliano]]
*[[Matteo Goffriller]]
*[[Giovanni Battista Guadagnini]]
*[[Giuseppe Guarneri]]
*[[Charles Mennégand]]
*[[Domenico Montagnana]]
*[[Giovanni Battista Rogeri]]
*[[Francesco Ruggieri]]
*[[Stefano Scarampella]]
*[[Antonio Stradivari]]
*[[David Tecchler]]
*[[Carlo Giuseppe Testore]]
*[[Jean Baptiste Vuillaume]]

==Cellists==
{{Main|List of cellists}}
A person who plays the cello is called a ''cellist''. For a list of notable cellists, see the [[list of cellists]] and [[:Category:Cellists]].

==Careers==
Careers in cello vary widely by genre and by region or country. Most cellists earn their living from a mixture of performance and teaching jobs. The first step to getting most performance jobs is by playing at an [[audition]]. In some styles of music, cellists may be asked to [[sight reading|sight read]] printed music or perform standard repertoire with an ensemble.

In classical music, cellists audition for playing jobs in orchestras and for admission into university or Conservatory programs or degrees. At a classical cello audition, the performer typically plays a movement from a Bach suite or a movement from a concerto and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the [[conductor (music)|conductor]], the [[Concertmaster]], the Principal cellist and other principal players.

The most promising candidates are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a ''test week'', in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.

Performance jobs include playing as a freelancer in small groups, playing in a [[chamber music]] group, large ensembles, or performing solo music, either live onstage or as a session player for radio or TV broadcasts or for recordings; and working as the employee of an orchestra, big band, or recording studio. Many cello players find extra work by substituting ("subbing") for cellists who are double-booked or ill. It is hard for many cello players to be able to find full-time, full-year work at a single job. About the closest that a cellist can come to this is in the case of those who win an audition at a professional orchestra. Even full-time orchestra jobs do not usually last for the entire year. When the orchestra stops playing (which is often in the summer), orchestral cellists have to find other work, either as a teacher or coach, or in another group.

Teaching work for cellists includes giving private lessons in the home or at colleges and universities; coaching cellists who are preparing for recordings or auditions; doing group coaching at music camps or for youth ensembles; and working as a high school music teacher. Due to the limited number of full-time orchestral jobs, many classical cellists are not able to find full-time work with a single orchestra. Some cellists increase their employ-ability by learning several different styles, such as folk or pop.

In some cases, cellists supplement their performing and teaching income with other related music jobs, such as working as a stringed instrument repairer (luthier); as a contractor who hires musicians for orchestras or big bands, composing music, songwriting, conducting, or organizing festivals (e.g., [[Julian Armour]]).

==Famous instruments==

[[File:Servais Stradivarius.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|The Servais Stradivarius is preserved in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]]]]
Specific instruments are famous (or become famous) for a variety of reasons. An instrument's notability may arise from its age, the fame of its maker, its physical appearance, its acoustic properties, and its use by notable performers. The most famous instruments are generally known for all of these things. The most highly prized instruments are now collector's items, and are priced beyond the reach of most musicians. These instruments are typically owned by some kind of organization or investment group, which may loan the instrument to a notable performer. (For example, the [[Davidov Stradivarius]], which is currently in the possession of one of the most widely known living cellists, Yo-Yo Ma, is actually owned by the Vuitton Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Beare | first=Charles | author2=Carlson, Bruce | chapter=Foreword by Yo-Yo Ma | title=Antonio Stradivari: The Cremona Exhibition of 1987 | location=London | publisher=J. &amp; A.

'''''Cloak of Deception''''' is a 2001 [[novel]] set in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Star Wars galaxy|galaxy]]. It is a [[prequel]] novel occurring before the events of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]''. The book was written by [[James Luceno]]. The cover art was by [[Steven Anderson (artist)|Steven Anderson]]. The book takes place 32.5 years before ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]''.

Narration for the audio version was performed by Alexander Adams. The paperback version included a 15-page excerpt of ''[[Enemy Lines I: Rebel Dream]]''.

==Synopsis==
The [[Galactic Republic]] is in a state of decline, mired in greed and corruption and tangled in bureaucracy. In the outlying systems, where the [[Trade Federation (Star Wars)|Trade Federation]] maintains a stranglehold on shipping routes, tensions are boiling over—while back in the comfort of [[Coruscant]], the hub of civilized space and seat of Republic government, few senators seem inclined to investigate the problem. And those who suspect Supreme Chancellor Valorum of having a hand in the machinations are baffled—especially when Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his apprentice [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] foil an assassination attempt on the Chancellor.

With the crisis escalating, Valorum calls for an emergency trade summit. As humans and aliens gather, conspiracies sealed with large sums of money run rampant, and no one is entirely above suspicion. But the greatest threat of all remains unknown to everyone except three members of the Trade Federation, who have entered into a shadowy alliance with the [[Sith|Sith lord]] [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]]. While Valorum, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan will be content with more money and fewer problems, Sidious has grander, far more terrifying plans.

==Writing==
While writing the novel, Luceno was granted access to parts of the screenplay drafts and concept art of ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]''. As such, ''Cloak of Deception'' marked the first appearance in the series' chronological timeline of almost all of the new characters from ''Attack of the Clones'', including the Techno Union, Passel Argente, and other Separatists.

===Opening crawl===
The back cover of the book features an [[Star Wars opening crawl|opening crawl]] similar to those at the beginning of the ''Star Wars'' films:

{{cquote|After a thousand generations of peace, the Galactic Republic is crumbling. On Coruscant, at the center of civilized space, greed and corruption riddle the Senate, beyond even the abilities of Supreme Chancellor Valorum to remedy. And in the outlying systems, the Trade Federation dominates the hyperlanes with its gargantuan vessels.

But now even the Trade Federation finds itself assailed from all quarters, preyed upon by pirates and raiders, and victimized by terrorists, who demand an end to the Federation's tyrannical practices.

It is a time that tests the mettle of all those who strive to hold the Republic together—none more than the Jedi Knights, who have long been the
Republic's best hope for preserving peace and justice…}}

The '''Comic Book Legal Defense Fund''' ('''CBLDF''') is an [[United States|American]] [[non-profit organization]] formed in 1986 to protect the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights of [[comics]] creators, publishers, and retailers covering legal expenses. The Executive Director is Charles Brownstein, who has served in that capacity since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbldf.org/about-us/staff/ "Staff"]. Comic Book Legal Defense Fund. Retrieved October 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:10.12.12CharlesBrownsteinByLuigiNovi8.jpg|thumb|left|CBLDF Executive Director Charles Brownstein speaking at the 2012 [[New York Comic Con]]]]
The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund began as a means to pay for the legal defense of ''Friendly Frank's'' comic shop manager Michael Correa,  who was arrested in 1986 on charges of distributing obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Maggie. [http://www.cbgxtra.com/default.aspx?tabid=42&amp;view=topic&amp;forumid=34&amp;postid=6606 "April 21, 1954: Mr. Gaines Goes to Washington," "The 1900s: 10 biggest events from 100 years in comics,"] CBGXtra.com (Dec. 12, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  The comic books deemed obscene were ''[[Omaha the Cat Dancer]]'', ''The Bodyssey'', ''[[Weirdo (magazine)|Weirdo]]'', and ''Bizarre Sex''. [[Kitchen Sink Press]] released an art portfolio of pieces donated by comics artists; proceeds were donated to Correa's defense.  First amendment attorney [[Burton Joseph]] defended ''Friendly Frank's'' and ultimately had the conviction overturned. [[Denis Kitchen]] officially incorporated the CBLDF in 1990 as a non-profit charitable organization with capital left over from Correa's defense fund, and Burton Joseph became their legal counsel in 1996. Since then the Fund and Burton Joseph have provided advice and legal assistance in many cases and incidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/17202.html "R.I.P. Burton Joseph, First Amendment Attorney"] IC&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;2 (4 April 2010), accessed 4 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 the CBLDF got honoured by the [[List of Eisner Award winners#Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award|Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award]].

The Fund publishes a quarterly newsletter called ''Busted! : the official newsletter of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund''. {{OCLC|41042960}}

On September 29, 2011, it was announced that the CBLDF acquired intellectual property rights of the [[Comics Code Authority]] seal from the now-defunct [[Comics Magazine Association of America]]; the sale coincided with [[Banned Books Week]]. The CBLDF intends to use the seal in merchandise through licensing agreements, with proceeds from the licenses benefitting the CBLDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbldf.org/homepage/cbldf-receives-comics-code-authority-seal-of-approval/|title=CBLDF Receives Comics Code Authority Seal of Approval - Comic Book Legal Defense Fund|website=Cbldf.org|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBLDF works independently and with coalitions to defend against unconstitutional legislation.&lt;ref name="cbldf.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbldf.org/about-2/|title=About - Comic Book Legal Defense Fund|website=Cbldf.org|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBLDF works with the Media Coalition, along with: [[American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression|The American Booksellers for Free Expression Group at ABA]], [[Association of American Publishers|Association of American Publishers, Inc.]], [[Authors Guild]], [[Entertainment Software Association]], [[Freedom to Read Foundation]], [[Motion Picture Association of America|Motion Picture Association of America, Inc]]., and [[Recording Industry Association of America|Recording Industry Association of America, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediacoalition.org/about/|title=ABOUT - mediacoalition|website=Mediacoalition.org|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were active plaintiffs against internet filters in libraries&lt;ref name="cbldf.org"/&gt; and more recently in 2012, a Utah bill that wanted to censor internet speech, which the CBLDF was able to help stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbldf.org/2012/05/free-speech-advocates-score-victory-in-utah/|title=Free Speech Advocates Score Victory in Utah - Comic Book Legal Defense Fund|website=Cbldf.org|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008 the CBLDF has published an annual comic book, ''The CBLDF Liberty Annual'', to which many major artists and writers, including [[J. Michael Straczynski]], [[Garth Ennis]], and [[Richard Corben]], have contributed.

==Programs==
The CBLDF creates toolkits that are available for librarians and others to use on the website.&lt;ref name="cbldf.org"/&gt;  They also give lectures and presentations "at comic book and anime conventions, library and book trade conferences, universities, and symposiums in the United States and around the world."&lt;ref name="cbldf.org"/&gt;

==Notable cases==
*1986: Michael Correa, store manager at Friendly Frank's, a comic store in [[Lansing, Illinois]], was charged with possession and sale of obscene material, after over 100 comic books were seized, including copies of ''[[Omaha the Cat Dancer]]'', and ''[[Verotika]]''.  He was convicted, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. Funds donated to the appeal exceeded costs, and the remainder went towards founding the CBLDF.&lt;ref&gt;Morrisard, James A. (March 4, 1998). [http://www.citypaper.com/arts/story.asp?id=5032 "Comics Relief - CBLDF Comes to Legal Aid of Comic-Book Artists, Publishers, and Sellers"]. ''[[Baltimore City Paper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1991: Comic artist [[Paul Mavrides]] protested against a resolution by the State of California to levy a sales tax on comic strips and comic books.  He challenged the law in court, with assistance from the CBLDF, arguing that the comic strip is a communications medium that should be classed with books, magazines, and newspapers (which are not subject to sales taxes due to [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] provisions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subgenius.com/bigfist/Vreedeez/X0005_Mavrides_Case_Could_.html|title=Mavrides Case Could Make or Break California Comics Publishing|website=Subgenius.com|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, a ruling in Mavrides' favor was handed down by the California State Board of Equalization.
*1994: [[Florida]]-based underground comic book artist [[Mike Diana]] was convicted in March for obscenity stemming from his self-published ''[[Boiled Angel]]''.  He was sentenced to three years probation, 1248 hours of community service, a $3000 fine, was banned from having contact with minors, and was forced to undergo a journalistic ethics course and a psychiatric evaluation at his own expense.  After relocating to [[New York City]] to serve out his sentence, he performs his community service hours&amp;mdash;working for the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbldf.org/casefiles/diana.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001121064500/http://www.cbldf.org/casefiles/diana.shtml |archivedate=2000-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2000: Comic book artist [[Kieron Dwyer]] was sued by [[Starbucks]] Coffee for parodying their famous mermaid logo within his comic book ''Lowest Common Denominator.'' Although the judge ruled that Starbucks could not sue a parody and the case settled out of court, Dwyer was forced to comply with the ruling that he could no longer use his logo for its confusing similarity to that of Starbucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbldf.org/pr/001130-starbucks.shtml |title=Cartoonist Kieron Dwyer Sued By Starbucks |accessdate=2016-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010204153200/http://www.cbldf.org/pr/001130-starbucks.shtml |archivedate=2001-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2002: The [[Castillo v. Texas]] case centered around Jesus Castillo, an employee of a comic book store in [[Dallas, Texas]], who charged with two counts of "display of obscenity", and convicted for one, after selling adult comics to an adult undercover police officer.
*2005: [[Rome, Georgia]] comics retailer [[Gordon Lee (comic store owner)|Gordon Lee]] was charged with distributing obscene material to a minor, after a child obtained an anthology comic containing brief nudity in an excerpt of ''[[The Salon (comics)|The Salon]]'' on [[Halloween]]. A mistrial was called in 2007, and the case was finally dismissed in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbldf.org/pr/archives/000310.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204081048/http://www.cbldf.org/pr/archives/000310.shtml |archivedate=2007-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/books/06gust.html |title=When Picasso Went Down To Georgia |author=George Gene Gustines |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 6, 2007 |accessdate=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3766">[[File:Pieter Bruegel II-Combat de Carnaval et Careme IMG 1463.JPG|thumb|Carnival and debauchery is also a running theme in the paintings of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], painted during the 16th century.]]
The '''Culture of Popular Laughter''' is a historical-[[anthropology|anthropological]] theory devised by the literary critic [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], first published in the book ''[[Rabelais and His World]]'', based on observations of [[popular culture]] in the [[Renaissance]]. Bakhtin analysed [[François Rabelais]]' book ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' and its portrayals of "grotesque realism" (i.e. celebrations of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|primary needs]]) and [[carnival]] in which [[Norm (social)|social norms]] were subverted.

The Culture of Popular Laughter combines two literary ideas developed by Bakhtin in the same work: the idea of "[[Grotesque body]]" and "[[Carnivalesque]]" debauchery. It is distinguished from each, however, by its applications outside literary theory.

==Carnivalesque==
{{main|Carnivalesque}}
The idea of "[[Carnivalesque]]" was also created by Bakhtin and forms part of his wider theory of Popular Laughter. He argued that, during times of carnival such as the [[Feast of Fools]], social norms were deliberately turned upside-down. The carnival then became a form of [[Safety-valve institution]], which served a [[Structural functionalism|Structural-functionalist]] role to temporarily release stresses in the contemporary social system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klaniczay|first=Gábor|title=The Uses of Supernatural Power: the Transformation of Popular Religion in Medieval and Early-modern Europe|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=0691073775|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bakhtin, however, argued that this form of system was "formalized" in the culture of the period as "popular laughter".

===Scope and influence===
The historian Gábor Klaniczay argued that the Culture of Popular Laughter stretched through all echelons of society and was certainly not restricted to the peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klaniczay|first=Gábor|title=The Uses of Supernatural Power: the Transformation of Popular Religion in Medieval and Early-modern Europe|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=0691073775|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakhtin's theory has also been credited with bringing about a scholarly reassessement of the importance of popular culture in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klaniczay|first=Gábor|title=The Uses of Supernatural Power: the Transformation of Popular Religion in Medieval and Early-modern Europe|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=0691073775|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The Culture of Popular Laughter was originally formulated based on the writings of Rabelais, but has also been applied in the interpretation of peasant scenes painted by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder#Family tree|his descendants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Walter S.|title=Pieter Bruegel and the Art of Laughter|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520245210|page=33|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The example has also been applied to Japanese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Wil|first=Theodore|title=Sources of Japanese tradition from earliest times-1600|year=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0231121393|page=471|edition=2nd|volume=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 2 (2013-2014)===

===Season 3 (2016)===

===Season 4 (2017)===
On [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], 4 episodes have not been included in the English release.

In 2018, Tales of Greenery (Curucuru and Friends) – Family of Forest is the US English adaptation of the 2005-2009 Korean stop-motion &amp; flash animated series that has been airing since July 7, 2014 and has aired a total of 52 episodes as of 2015. Since February 1, 2016 the US adaptation airs bilingually in [[South Korea]] on [[Disney Channel Korea]]. As of June 12, 2016, broadcasts of new episodes in the US are currently on hiatus according to [[Bang Zoom! Entertainment]]. However, [[Disney XD]] began to rerun the existing dubbed episodes in March 2017 as a lead-in to its new weekday afternoon animated block.

This dub takes many liberties from the original Korean version. Besides using the name changes that were used in Alt Korea's English adaptation of the original manga, other changes and edits have been made to make the show more relatable to an American audience, such as Korean text being replaced with English text on certain objects like signs and graded papers, items such as yen notes being replaced by US dollar bills, and the setting being changed from Seoul to a small town in the southern US state of North Carolina.’

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="895">A '''cut-out score''' or '''cutout score''' is a [[Sheet music|musical score]] in which measures with [[rest (music)|rests]] are simply omitted, and no rests of any kind are used. Cut-out scores are mostly used for proportional notation scores, such as Penderecki's ''[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]''. "Proponents of this arrangement argue that it dispenses with needless clutter on the score page," while "others maintain that not enough is gained by this format to justify the extra effort in setting up the score."&lt;ref&gt;Kennan &amp; Grantham (1990): 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Cut-out scores can be created with any full-featured [[scorewriter]], such as Finale or Sibelius. Instead of extracting parts, all the players are given the score.

'''''Deadly Class''''' is an [[Action fiction|action]] [[genre]] [[American comic book]] series written by [[Rick Remender]], illustrated by Wesley Craig, colored by [[Lee Loughridge]], and lettered by Rus Wooton. ''Deadly Class'' follows students enrolled at King's Dominion Atelier of the Deadly Arts, a secret high school in [[San Francisco]], as they train to become the next generation of top assassins for crime families across the globe.

[[Image Comics]] has published ''Deadly Class'' on a mostly monthly basis since the first issue was released on January 22, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://imagecomics.com/comics/releases/deadly-class-1|title=Deadly Class #1|date=June 15, 2017|publisher=Image Comics|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The first issues of ''Deadly Class'' focus on the story of teenage orphan Marcus Lopez Arguello as he transitions from living on the streets to being enrolled into a school of assassins. The academy, run by Master Lin, is composed of children of mob bosses and mass murderers, learning the same trade as their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://comicsverse.com/deadly-class/|title=DEADLY CLASS: The Making of a Murderer|last=Danoff|first=Mara|date=April 20, 2017|website=Comicverse|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus's decision to attend the school is one of the only decisions he gets to make for himself throughout the arc and history. His entire life has been composed of unfortunate events, each leaving him further ostracized from humanity. Marcus's lack of residence is primarily due to both of his parents dying in a horrible accident when he was young. This resulted in Marcus being placed into an orphanage, in which the head of the house required his manual labor for him to retain residence. This continued degradation of his sanity through the abuse by the hands of his roommates and guardians eventually drives him to committing a massive act of violence.

''Deadly Class'' then continues to follow the stories of the individuals enrolled in the academy and many of their eventual downfalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/remender-breaks-down-the-aftermath-of-deadly-class-freshmen-finals/|title=Remender Breaks Down the Aftermath of "Deadly Class'" Freshmen Finals|last=Richards|first=Dave|date=June 6, 2016|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elgato''' is a brand of consumer technology products. The manufacturer, also called Elgato, was founded in 1992 by Markus Fest and is headquartered in [[Munich, Germany]].&lt;ref name="gigagioam"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato ends collaboration with Miglia|first=Eddie|last=Hargreaves|date=March 12, 2007|publisher=Giga Om|url=http://gigaom.com/2007/03/12/elgato-ends-collaboration-with-miglia/|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elgato is best known for a line of video-recording products called EyeTV, which record video from over-the-air antennas, satellite TV, or mobile devices. The first EyeTV product was introduced in November 2002.

More recently{{When|date=July 2018}}, Elgato introduced a line of "smart" products, such as a [[Keychain#Key fob|key fob]] that tracks the user's distance from their car or purse and provides notifications to help them find it. In 2014, it introduced a home monitoring system called Eve, which provides alerts to users regarding things like air pressure, temperature and water use. Elgato also developed light bulbs that can respond to programming on a mobile device and respond to commands over Bluetooth and it produces two [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] products: a dock for MacBooks and an external hard drive. In May 2018, Elgato introduced Eve Aqua a HomeKit smart water controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/29/eve-aqua-control-garden-hose-and-sprinklers-with-homekit/|title=Elgato launches Eve Aqua to let you control your garden hose and sprinklers with HomeKit|date=2018-05-29|work=9to5Mac|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/29/17404914/elgato-eve-aqua-smart-hose-controller-apple-ios-homekit|title=Elgato made a HomeKit-connected smart hose controller|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28th, 2018, [[Corsair Components]] acquired the gaming departments of Elgato, while Elgato's smart home team remains their own company and spun off as [[Eve Systems]].

===History===
The first EyeTV hardware device was introduced in November 2002.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;{{cite news|title=EyeTV 200|last=Seff|first=Jonathan|publisher=Macworld|date=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a small [[USB]]-powered device that contained a cable tuner and hardware encoder in order to convert television video into an MPEG-1 format for watching on a computer.&lt;ref name="five"/&gt; It also had coaxial and RCA plugs to connect it with a VCR or camcorder.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{cite news|first=Seff|last=Jonathan|title=EyeTV|date=November 2002|publisher=Macworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 article in Macworld said it was the "first step" in bridging computers and television, but at this point still had "some kinks".&lt;ref name="five"/&gt;

The next iteration was released in 2004 and called EyeTV 200. EyeTV 200 introduced a digital remote control and converted video programming into the higher-quality MPEG-2 format.&lt;ref name="ten"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;{{cite news|title=Devices Mimic TiVo -- Somewhat|newspaper=The Washington Post|first1=Daniel|last1=Greenberg|first2=Kevin|last2=Savetz|date=June 20, 2004|pp=F07|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54095-2004Jun19.html|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Macworld]] review gave it 4 out of 5 stars for "very good" and emphasized the video quality and ease-of-use.&lt;ref name="ten"/&gt; A story in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' said it was more expensive than some alternatives, but worked on a Mac and had good-quality recordings.&lt;ref name="thirteen"/&gt;  Also in 2004 the first EyeTV product for satellite television was introduced with the EyeTV 310,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.elgato.com/de/news/eyetv-310-fuer-paytv-mac&lt;/ref&gt; which was later discontinued and replaced with EyeTV Sat.&lt;ref name="register"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato EyeTV Sat|first=Cliff|last=Joseph|date=July 29, 2009|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/29/review_dvr_elgato_eyetv_sat/|newspaper=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year a home media server called EyeHome was introduced. It had recording features similar to other EyeTV products, but was also intended for streaming a computer display to a television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mac Get Its Big Break: A Role in Home Theaters|date=May 27, 2004|newspaper=The New York Times|first=J. D.|last =Biersdorfer|accessdate=August 13, 2014|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/27/technology/circuits/27home.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It connected Mac computers and televisions that share the same home network. A review in Macworld gave it three stars or a "good" rating, saying that it was easy to install and worked well with Apple applications, but some aspects were quirky or frustrating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EyeHome|last=Seff|first=Jonathan|publisher=Macworld|date=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sound and Vision Magazine'' said it was "pretty darn cool" and an easy, inexpensive way to get media server functionality, though there were some user interface quirks. It gave the product an 89 out of 100 rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato EyeHome Digital Media Player and EyeTV 200 Tuner/DVR Page|newspaper=Sound and Vision Magazine|url=http://www.soundandvision.com/content/elgato-eyehome-digital-media-player-and-eyetv-200-tunerdvr-page-1|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2005, several other EyeTV products had been introduced, such as the EyeTV for DTT, the EyeTV EZ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Digital TV in tiny package|first=Chris|last=Oaten|newspaper=Advertiser|date=November 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the EyeTV Wonder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Small Rooms, Fitting Many Functions: Tech Built for the Dorm|first=J.D.|last=Biersdorfer|date=August 3, 2005|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/03/technology/techspecial3/03biersdorfer.html?_r=0|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EyeTV for DTT (digital terrestrial TV) is a small USB-powered device with an antenna for receiving free over-the-air television broadcasts. It received a 4 out of 5 rating in TechRadar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Do good things always come in small packages? Elgato thinks so...|publisher=TechRadar|first=Christopher|last=Phin|date=September 6, 2008|url=http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/pc-mac/pc-components/tv-tuner-cards/elgato-eyetv-dtt-deluxe-457756/review|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''The Register'' gave it an 85 percent rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato EyeTV DTT Mac digital TV tuner|first=Cliff|last=Joseph|date=November 26, 2008|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/11/26/review_tv_tuner_mac_elgato_eyetv_dtt/|newspaper=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eye TV Wonder was only available from July 2005 to January 2006, before being discontinued and replaced with the Eye TV EZ. The EZ was a basic, entry-level product with an analog tuner for watching TV on a Mac computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EyeTV EZ|first=Anton|last=Linecker|publisher=Macworld|date=January 13, 2006|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1048910/eyetvez.html|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, version 2.1 of the EyeTV software was introduced with a new user-interface, an integrated TV guide from [[TitanTV]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Products|journal=IEEE Multimedia|volume=13|issue=2|year=2006|pages=93–94|issn=1070-986X|doi=10.1109/MMUL.2006.38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compatibility with Apple remotes.&lt;ref name="twenty"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato EyeTV 2.3 and equinux MediaCentral 2.1|last=Withers|first=Stephen|publisher=APC|date=November 2006|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/product-reviews/22851456/elgato-eyetv-2-3-equinux-mediacentral-2-1|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interface was similar to that of other Apple products.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; An article in Macworld praised the update and especially the new editing features, but said it had some quirks, such as a difficult-to-find Edit button.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite news|title=EyeTV 2.1|first=Anton|last=Linecker| newspaper=Macworld|date=March 28, 2006|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1050065/eyetv21.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the iHome software, which plays video content from a computer onto a television, was released in 2006 as a universal binary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato offers Universal Binary update for EyeHome|first=Peter|last=Cohen|newspaper=PC World|date=June 5, 2006|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1051185/eyehome.html|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 2.4 of the EyeTV software was released in 2007 and added an export tool for Apple TV.&lt;ref name="MachoverKasik2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Machover|first1=Carl|last2=Kasik|first2=David J.|title=Tools and Products|journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|volume=27|issue=4|year=2007|pages=96–95|issn=0272-1716|doi=10.1109/MCG.2007.92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exit from the ATSC tuner market====
As of February 2015, Elgato no longer sells [[ATSC]] tuners. (ATSC is the digital television standard used in the United States, Canada, South Korea, Mexico and the Dominican Republic.)  The Elgato web site explicitly declines to give a reason: "Elgato Technical Support is not able to comment on this business decision."&lt;ref&gt;As of February 2015, Elgato no longer offers TV tuner devices in North America https://help.elgato.com/customer/portal/articles/1858903-as-of-february-2015-elgato-no-longer-offers-tv-tuner-devices-in-north-america&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, [https://www.elgato.com/en/news/eyetv-february-2016 Elgato sells the EyeTV business to Geniatech Europe GmbH], a wholly owned subsidiary of Shenzhen Geniatech Inc., Ltd. Geniatech will take over the complete EyeTV product line. This company no longer sells the Turbo.264 HD software and reduced digital TV tuners to one model. No news about Thunderbolt products continuity.

===Current products===

====Over the air====
The EyeTV Diversity is a USB-powered device with dual [[Antenna tuner|tuner]]s for receiving over the air television broadcasts. The tuners can be used simultaneously for an optimized signal, or one tuner can be used to record a channel, while another is used to watch a separate show.&lt;ref name="thirty"/&gt; Diversity was first introduced in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato unveils dual-tuner EyeTV Diversity USB stick in the UK|first=Darren|last=Murph|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/11/07/elgato-unveils-dual-tuner-eyetv-diversity-usb-stick-in-the-uk/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=August 12, 2014|date=November 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A driver in 2009 added compatibility with Windows 7.&lt;ref name="thirty"/&gt; A review in TechRadar gave EyeTV Diversity five out of five stars.&lt;ref name="twentythree"/&gt; [[PC Advisor]] and Pocket-Lint both gave it four out of five stars.&lt;ref name="thirty"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato EyeTV Diversity review|first=Andrew|last=Harrison|newspaper=PC Advisor |date=December 15, 2009|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/pc-peripheral/3208742/elgato-eyetv-diversity-review/|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato EyeTV Diversity dual-tuner DVB-T stick review|first=Stuart|last=Miles|date=February 11, 2009|accessdate=August 12, 2014|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/70918-elgato-eyetv-diversity-dvb-tuner-review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elgato EyeTV Hybrid.JPG|The EyeTV Hybrid|thumb|right]]EyeTV Hybrid, which can pick up digital or analog television broadcasts, was first released in early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hands On With Elgato’s EyeTV Hybrid|first=Charlie|last=Sorrel|date=March 10, 2009|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/03/hands-on-with-e/|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CNET review said the device was easy and effective to use, but that buffering was often too slow to make watching live TV practical.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=August 12, 2014|publisher=CNET|date=April 18, 2011|title=Elgato EyeTV Hybrid review: Elgato EyeTV Hybrid|url=http://www.cnet.com/products/elgato-eyetv-hybrid/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macworld said EyeTV's "core strength" was recording scheduled TV shows.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; A review in ''PC Magazine'' gave the product 3.5 out of 5 stars. The review said it "works exceptionally well" but doesn't come with Windows software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato EyeTV Hybrid|newspaper=PC Magazine|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372891,00.asp|first=Will|last=Greenwald|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Satellite====
In June 2010, the EyeTV HD product for recording [[High-definition television|high-definition]] cable and satellite programming was introduced.&lt;ref name="forty"/&gt; Because cable and satellite signals are encoded, the device must be connected to a tuner from a television provider. Then it provides remote controls, recording and DVR-functionality from a connected computer. A Macworld review gave the product four out of five stars.&lt;ref name="forty"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato EyeTV HD|first=Jonathan|last=Seff|publisher=Macworld|date=June 11, 2010|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1151922/eyetvhd_review.html|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''Laptop Magazine'' gave EyeTV HD 3.5 out of 5 stars. It said the interface was intuitive and the video quality was good, but noted it was only compatible with Macs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato EyeTV HD Review|first=Michael|last=Prospero|date=June 15, 2010|url=http://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/accessories/elgato-eyetv-hd#sthash.WZ6IqXkd.dpuf|newspaper=Laptop Magazine|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EyeTV Netstream 4Sat has four satellite tuners, allowing four channels to be watched simultaneously from different devices. It was introduced in 2014.&lt;ref name="fortyone"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato EyeTV Netstream 4Sat review: DVB-S2 HD TV Tuner|first=David|last=Denver|date=January 20, 2014|url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/review/mac-accessories/elgato-eyetv-netstream-4sat-review-3497900/|publisher=Macworld|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in Macworld gave it 5 out of 5 stars. The review said Elgato had addressed some of the limitations of prior EyeTV satellite tuners like Netstream Sat/DTT.&lt;ref name="fortyone"/&gt; Pocket-Lint gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato EyeTV Netstream 4Sat review|first=Ian|last=Morris|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/127555-elgato-eyetv-netstream-4sat-review|publisher=Pocket-Lint|accessdate=August 14, 2014|date=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNET gave it five stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Elgato EyeTV Netstream DTT review|publisher=CNET|url=http://www.cnet.com/uk/products/elgato-eyetv-netstream-dtt/|accessdate=August 14, 2014|date=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EyeTV Sat product, which receives free-to-air television, was introduced in Europe in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato EyeTV Sat review|first=Adrian|last=Justins|date=October 20, 2009|publisher=TechRadar|url=http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/pc-mac/pc-components/tv-tuner-cards/elgato-eyetv-sat-619309/review|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Register'' gave it an 80% rating, saying that it "works well" and that the documentation did not make it clear how to install the Apple and Windows versions of the software.&lt;ref name="register"/&gt;

====Software====
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:EyeTV controller.png|thumb|right|The EyeTV digital remote|100px]] --&gt;
The EyeTV software was updated to version 3.0 in 2008. 3.0 made user interface improvements, such as being able to mark favorites or automatically record shows in a series. A review in TechRadar gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars. The review noted that EyeTV was the de facto software for TV and computer video integration and praised its new features, but said it was expensive when purchased separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato EyeTV 3 review: The best TV software just got better, but it’s not cheap|publisher=TechRadar|date=February 26, 2008|url=http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/pc-mac/pc-components/tv-tuner-cards/elgato-eyetv-3-224285/review|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 article in ''MacLife'' said their "top picks" for USB-powered tuners were those using the EyeTV software, such as the EyeTV hybrid or EyeTV 250.&lt;ref name="Inc.2007"/&gt; In addition to Elgato's EyeTV line of consumer devices, other brands such as Terratec and Miglia use the EyeTV software in their products through licensing agreements with Elgato.&lt;ref name="twentythree"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato EyeTV Diversity review|date=January 10, 2007|url=http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/pc-mac/pc-components/tv-tuner-cards/elgato-eyetv-diversity-39985/review|publisher=TechRadar|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inc.2007"&gt;{{cite book|first=Cathy|last=Lu|title=Mac Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgIAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA36|date=March 2007|publisher=Future US, Inc.|pages=36–37|id=19354010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart key===
[[File:Elgato Smart Key hand.jpg|thumb|right|The Smart Key fob]]
Elgato manufactures and markets a smart-key system. The system comes with a small 10-gram device that is placed on a key ring, in a purse, inside a car, or somewhere else.&lt;ref name="nextweb"/&gt; Then it communicates with an Elgato app on an iOS device. If it is set up for keys, the app will alert the user when they are 10 meters away from their keys, indicating that they may have forgotten them.&lt;ref name="nextweb"/&gt; It takes advantage of the "Smart Bluetooth" Apple implemented in iOS 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato's Smart Key uses iOS 7 Bluetooth Smart improvements to track your keys|date=October 11, 2013|first=Katie|last=Collins|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-10/11/elgato-smart-key|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in TheNextWeb said it was "money well spent" and worked "exactly as described", but that the beeping of the device could be louder and users will still need to supplement it with the Find my Phone app.&lt;ref name="nextweb"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Elgato Smart Key taps Bluetooth LE to help find your keys and remember where your car’s parked|url=https://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2013/12/06/elgato-smart-key/|date=December 6, 2013|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=August 14, 2014|first=Paul|last=Sawers}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato Smart Key Review: iPhone and iPad proximity location device tracker|date=December 10, 2013|first=Lou|last=Hattersley|url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/review/ios-accessories/elgato-smart-key-review-iphone-ipad-device-tracker-3493163/|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart home===
In September 2014, Elgato announced a home monitoring system called Eve, which monitors a home's air pressure, water usage, temperature, air quality and other factors. Elgato said the product won't be available until the HomeKit software, which is expected to come with Apple iOS 8, is released.&lt;ref name="dkajfhk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato Eve will monitor the air in your house, works with iOS 8 HomeKit|first=Luke|last=Westaway |date=September 1, 2014|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/elgato-eve-monitors-the-air-in-your-house-works-with-ios-8-homekit/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also introduced smart light bulbs, which communicate with iOS devices through Bluetooth and allow users to adjust home lighting from their mobile device.&lt;ref name="dkajfhk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato announces $50 Avea smart lightbulb and Eve smart home sensors|first=Michael|last=Gorman|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/09/01/elgato-avea-smart-lightbulb-eve-smart-home-sensors/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart power===
In late 2014, Elgato introduced the Smart Power battery backup for mobile devices. It communicates with the user's bluetooth-enabled device to provide notifications and calendar reminders when it needs to be charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato Smart Power: iPhone battery watches your calendar|date=September 1, 2014|url=http://www.slashgear.com/elgato-smart-power-iphone-battery-watches-your-calendar-01343804/|accessdate=September 9, 2014|publisher=Slashgear|first=Chris|last=Burns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thunderbolt==

===Thunderbolt dock===
[[File:Elgato Dock Back.jpg|thumb|right|A rear view of the Elgato Thunderbolt dock showing the available ports]]
Elgato introduced a [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] [[docking station]] in June 2014. A computer is plugged into the dock using a Thunderbolt port in order to gain access to the dock's three USB ports, audio jacks, HDMI and ethernet. It is typically used to plug a Macbook into an office setting (printer, monitor, keyboard) or to provide additional ports not available in the Macbook Air.&lt;ref name="cnettt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Add a slew of ports to your MacBook with the Elgato Thunderbolt Dock|date=April 4, 2014|url=http://www.cnet.com/products/elgato-thunderbolt-dock/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="registertwodlh"&gt;{{cite news|title=Plugging the gaps in today's Macs: Elgato Thunderbolt Dock|first=Bob|last=Dormon|date=June 3, 2014|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/03/review_elgato_thunderbolt_dock/|accessdate=August 14, 2014|newspaper=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato Thunderbolt Dock review: This sleek station will supercharge your laptop-powered workspace|publisher=TheNextWeb|url=https://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2014/04/14/elgato-thunderbolt-dock-review/|accessdate=August 14, 2014|first=Nick|last=Summers|date=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''The Register'' said it was compact and useful, but Windows users should consider a USB 3.0 dock.&lt;ref name="registertwodlh"/&gt; ''The Register'' and CNET disagreed on whether it was competitively priced.&lt;ref name="cnettt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="registertwodlh"/&gt; Reviews in TechRadar and Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/review/mac-accessories/elgato-thunderbolt-dock-review-3532358/|publisher=MacWorld|title=Elgato Thunderbolt Dock review|first=Andrew|last=Harrison |date=July 23, 2014|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato Thunderbolt Dock review:Connect several devices to your computer by plugging in a single cable|first=Alan|last=Stonebridge|date=May 1, 2014|url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/input-devices/general-input-devices/elgato-thunderbolt-dock-1246495/review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thunderbolt SSD===
[[File:Thunderbolt Drive+ sideview 01.jpg|thumb|left|The Elgato Thunderbolt Drive+]]
Elgato introduced two firewire external hard drives in September 2012 called Thunderbolt Drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato's Thunderbolt SSD brings no noise, brings the pain(less) operation|first=Daniel|last=Cooper|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/01/09/elgato-thunderbolt-ssd/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benchmark tests by MacWorld and Tom's Hardware said that the hard drive was slower than other products they tested, despite being connected through a faster Thunderbolt port, rather than Firewire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nine External Thunderbolt Storage Devices, Rounded Up|first=Andrew|last=Ku|date=July 15, 2012|publisher=Tom's Hardware|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/my-book-thunderbolt-duo-pegasus-r4-2big,3222-2.html|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato's bus-powered Thunderbolt SSD|first=Kean|last=Bartleman|publisher=Macworld|date=May 2, 2012|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1166646/elgatos_bus_powered_thunderbolt_ssd.html|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, in 2013, Elgato replaced them with similar drives identified as "Thunderbolt Drive +", which added USB 3.0 support and was claimed to be faster than the previous iteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato Thunderbolt Drive+ SSD earns its 'plus' tag through USB 3.0 and brisk speeds|first=Jon|last=Fingas|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/11/08/elgato-thunderbolt-drive-plus/|date=November 8, 2013|accessdate=August 14, 2014|publisher=Engadget}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CNET review of a Thunderbolt Drive+ drive gave it a 4.5 out of 5 star rating. It said the drive was "blazing fast" and "the most portable drive to date" but was also expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato Thunderbolt Drive+ review: Blazing fast portable drive|date=February 14, 2014|url=http://www.cnet.com/products/elgato-thunderbolt-drive-plus-256gb/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=August 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''The Register'' explained that the original drives introduced in 2012 didn't perform well in benchmark tests, but the newer "plus" version had impressive speed results during testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vulture wraps claws around Elgato Thunderbolt Drive+ portable SSD|date=March 6, 2014|first=Bob|last=Dormon|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/06/elgato_thunderbolt_plus_portable_ssd_drive/|accessdate=August 14, 2014|newspaper=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaming==
Game Capture HD, which connects to gaming consoles to record gameplay, was introduced in 2012. It was created in response to gamers that were hacking EyeTV products for gameplay recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What is ... Elgato's Game Capture HD|first=Adam |last=Turner|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device connects between a gaming console and the TV and is powered by a USB connection. It captures video as the console sends it to the television, compresses and stores it.&lt;ref name="gizmodo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato Game Capture HD 60: Australian Review|date=October 29, 2014|first=Campbell|last=Simpson|publisher=Gizmodo Australia|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2014/10/elgato-game-capture-hd-60-australian-review/|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in iPhone Life gave it 4 out of 5 stars and noted that it could also be used to record iPad games with the right setup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Record iPad Video with Elgato Game Capture HD|first=Mike|last=Riley|date=July 15, 2013|url=http://www.iphonelife.com/blog/177/elgato-game-capture-hd-review|newspaper=iphone life magazine|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 Elgato released a new version called HD 60. It recorded in 60 frames per second and 1080p high definition video (compared to the previous Game Capture HD's 1080p30 or 720p60), whereas typical low-end video game recording devices capture in 720p and 30 frames per second. ''The Telegraph'' gave it four out of five stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elgato Game Capture HD 60 review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/video-game-reviews/11158250/Elgato-Game-Capture-HD-60-review.html|accessdate=October 30, 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=October 17, 2014|first=Tom|last=Hoggins}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in Gizmodo said that it captured extremely high-quality footage, but it may be higher-end than needed for many gamers that would be satisfied with the recording features built into the console.&lt;ref name="gizmodo"/&gt;

In June 2018, [[Corsair Components]] acquired Elgato Gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/27/corsair-acquires-elgato-gaming/|title=Corsair buys Elgato's gaming business to get into livestreaming|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

😂, officially referred to as '''Face with Tears of Joy emoji'''—and also known as the '''LOL emoji''', '''joy emoji''', '''laughing emoji''', '''laughing crying emoji''', or the '''crying laughing emoji'''—is an [[emoji]] featuring a jovial face laughing, while also crying out tears. It can also be used for joking and teasing. It is one of the most commonly used emojis on [[social media]] websites such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Instagram]].

==Development and usage history==
{{See also|Emoji}}
The creation and early development of [[emoji]]s dates back to 1999 in Japan, and is attributed to Japanese telecommunications planner and then-[[NTT DoCoMo]] employee Shigetaka Kurita, who sketched illustrations after coming up with the idea of adding simple images to NTT DoCoMo's texting feature.&lt;ref name=Steinmetz2015&gt;{{cite web|last=Steinmetz|first=Katy|url=http://time.com/4114886/oxford-word-of-the-year-2015-emoji/|title=Oxford's 2015 Word of the Year Is This Emoji|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 16, 2015|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cocozza2015&gt;{{cite web|last=Cocozza|first=Paula|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/17/crying-with-laughter-how-we-learned-how-to-speak-emoji|title=Crying with laughter: how we learned how to speak emoji|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=November 17, 2015|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] released the [[iPhone (1st generation)|first iPhone]] in 2007, there was an emoji keyboard intended for Japanese users only.&lt;ref name=Cocozza2015/&gt; However, after iPhone users in the United States discovered that downloading Japanese [[Mobile app|apps]] allowed access to the keyboard, pressure grew to expand availability of the emoji keyboard beyond Japan, and in 2011, Apple made it an [[iOS]] international standard.&lt;ref name=Cocozza2015/&gt; Global popularity of emojis then surged in the early to mid-2010s.&lt;ref name=OD2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/11/word-of-the-year-2015-emoji/|title=Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year 2015 is…|work=[[Oxford Dictionaries|Oxford Dictionaries Blog]]|date=November 16, 2015|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity on social media and cultural impact==
In the mid-2010s, the emoji became [[mainstream]]; on June 5, 2014, ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'' noted that the "Face with Tears of Joy" emoji (😂) was the second most used emoji on the Twitter platform, appearing in 278+ million tweets, only behind the "Hearts" emoji (♥️)'s 342+ million figure.&lt;ref name=Chalabi2014&gt;{{cite web|last=Chalabi|first=Mona|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-100-most-used-emojis/|title=The 100 Most-Used Emojis|work=[[FiveThirtyEight]]|date=June 5, 2014|accessdate=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxford University Press]] partnered with the mobile technology business [[SwiftKey]] to explore frequency and usage statistics for global popular emoji usage, detailing that in 2015, 😂 was chosen as [[Oxford Dictionaries]]' [[Word of the year#Oxford|Word of the Year]] because it was the most used emoji, globally, in that respective year.&lt;ref name=OD2015/&gt; In a blog post, Oxford Dictionaries expressed that the emoji "was chosen as the 'word' that best reflected the ethos, mood, and preoccupations of 2015."&lt;ref name=HaleStern2015&gt;{{cite web|last=Hale-Stern|first=Kaila|url=https://gizmodo.com/and-your-2015-word-of-the-year-is-the-face-with-tears-1742855716|title=And Your 2015 Word of the Year Is...the Face With Tears of Joy Emoji?|work=[[Gizmodo]]|date=November 16, 2015|accessdate=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; SwiftKey further detailed that the emoji made up 20% of all the emojis used in the UK in 2015, and 17% of those in the US, up from 4% and 9% respectively, in 2014.&lt;ref name=OD2015/&gt; Oxford Dictionaries president Caspar Grathwohl explained Oxford's choice, stating, "emoji are becoming an increasingly rich form of communication, one that transcends linguistic borders."&lt;ref name=Steinmetz2015/&gt; 

In May 2015, [[Instagram|Instagram Engineering]] posted a blog that highlighted Instagram user data, revealing that the emoji was the most popularly used on the [[Instagram]] platform.&lt;ref name=Dimson2015&gt;{{cite web|last=Dimson|first=Thomas|url=https://engineering.instagram.com/emojineering-part-1-machine-learning-for-emoji-trendsmachine-learning-for-emoji-trends-7f5f9cb979ad|title=Emojineering Part 1: Machine Learning for Emoji Trends|work=Instagram Engineering|date=May 1, 2015|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 7, 2015, the [[Twitter|Twitter Data]] team tweeted out that the Face with Tears of Joy emoji was the most used on the Twitter platform during the year, with over 6.6 billion uses of it to that point.&lt;ref name=McHugh2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=TwitterData|number=673905956909133824|title=Here are the most-used emoji on Twitter this year. 😂 comes out on top, with 6.6 billion uses. #YearOnTwitter|date=December 7, 2015|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In November 2013, Brenden Gallagher of ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' ranked the "Laughing Crying Face" emoji at #2 in his "Emoji Power Rankings", writing that "research courtesy of Complex Stats and Information indicates that the Laughing Crying Face has almost reached a point of complete saturation".&lt;ref name=Gallagher2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Brenden|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/11/emoji-power-rankings/|title=Emoji Power Rankings: The Top 25|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=November 14, 2013|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Oxford's choice to make "😂" their word of the year in 2015, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' staff writer Katy Waldman commented that "😂 [is] the right linguistic incarnation of yet another complicated year, not to mention a good commentary on the very act of choosing a word of the year. What does it mean? Is it good or bad? It depends! With [the emoji's] intense and inscrutable emotional [[lability]], [it] is less of a word and more of an invitation to invent some sort of meaning".&lt;ref name=Waldman2015&gt;{{cite web|last=Waldman|first=Katy|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2015/11/16/the_face_with_tears_of_joy_emoji_is_the_word_of_the_year_says_oxford_dictionaries.html|title=This Year's Word of the Year Isn't Even a Word 😂😂😂|work=Lexicon Valley|publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''|date=November 16, 2015|accessdate=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the reasoning behind the emoji's popularity, Fred Benenson, author of ''[[Adaptations of Moby-Dick|Emoji Dick]]'', commented that "it is versatile. It can be used to convey joy, obviously, but also 'I'm laughing so hard I'm crying.' So you've got two basic, commonly occurring human emotions covered."&lt;ref name=McHugh2015/&gt; Benenson also attributed the emoji's popularity to it being one of the better designed emojis from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].&lt;ref name=McHugh2015/&gt; Abi Wilkinson, a freelance journalist writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', opined that the Face with Tears of Joy emoji is "the worst emoji of all", describing it as an "obnoxious, chortling little yellow dickhead [with] bulbous, cartoonish tears streaming down its face".&lt;ref name=Wilkinson2016&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilkinson|first=Abi|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/24/tears-of-joy-emoji-worst-gloat-about-human-suffering|title=The 'tears of joy' emoji is the worst of all – it's used to gloat about human suffering|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=November 24, 2016|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Financial betting''' refers to the [[wagering]] on the price development of a [[financial instrument]] at some later date relative to the current price or level of the instrument, against odds offered by a bookmaker. Maximum potential pay-off of the wager is known when the bet is taken and as a corollary risk is known beforehand by being limited to the initial stake.

Financial betting instruments are a type of [[digital option]]. The outcome of the wager at settlement is binary, that is, either a win or a loss. Settlement is executed in cash and there is no delivery of the underlying asset. At any point in time prior to the [[settlement date]] bets can often be sold, allowing for possibilities to bet on the accuracy of a market move within the fixed limits of zero win (loss of the stake) and maximum potential win. A fee might sometimes be charged for this service.

The main difference between financial betting and [[speculation]] on financial markets using products such as [[Spread betting#Financial spread betting|financial spread betting]] is that the bet must result in a simple binary win or loss based on an event on the underlying financial instruments.  This triggers a fixed payout for a win, while with spread betting the payout or loss varies with the price level of the underlying instrument.

== Basis in financial theory ==

Odds have to be consistent with the real-time pricing of the underlying financial instruments listed on [[foreign exchange market]]s or [[securities exchange]]s in order to avoid [[arbitrage]] opportunities (although this might not be possible because of limitations on shorting, i.e. laying bets). Calculation of the odds therefore draws on the [[Black–Scholes]] formula for pricing options. Using some variation of the model to solve for volatility, from observed market prices of traded options, gives [[implied volatility]]. Implied volatility is forward looking, that is, it can be used to estimate the odds for future price movements using mathematical algorithms.

== Types of financial betting ==

There are three main variations of financial betting. These vary mainly in the way odds are displayed.

# Fixed odds financial betting
# Floating odds financial betting
# [[Binary betting]]

== Fixed and floating odds betting ==
Within financial floating odds the odds change for a given strike price as the price of the underlying changes. The floating odds company calculates odds for different strikes and how much can be won upon settlement depends on how much is bet at those odds.

Within financial fixed odds betting the odds are fixed, while the [[strike price]] where a win is achieved relative the current level changes. The fixed odds company will calculate how much has to be bet to win a certain amount upon settlement if the conditions of the prediction become true.

== Binary betting ==
Binary betting displays odds as an index from 0 to 100 where the bet settles at 100 if the event happens and 0 if it does not. An amount is wagered per point on the index. The event can be bought or sold, making it possible to profit both from the event occurring or not occurring.

== Features ==

A central feature of financial betting is the fixed risk nature which allows market participants to limit the risk to a known amount. When one opens a bet (long or short) they know beforehand what risk they are taking. What is important here is that you can exit your bet at any time before settlement thus you have an option of minimizing the risk even further. The same can be applied to the winning bets (you can collect the win before the settlement time).

[[Liquidity]] is always provided and is achieved by the bookmaker acting as a [[market maker]], always being willing to sell bets to a buyer, and in the case it is permitted, to buy bets back from a participant wanting to sell the bet before it expires. 

A central feature of financial betting is [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]]. The benefit of leverage to the participant is that it allows a greater percentage change in capital than if it were invested directly in the underlying asset. This makes financial betting less capital intensive than trading directly on securities exchanges.

The '''Floating Match on Card''' is a classic [[close-up magic]] effect.

==Effect==
[[Image:Floatingmatchoncard.nwr.jpg|thumbnail|Floating Match on Card]]

A [[match]] is placed on the back of a [[playing card]]. The [[Magician (illusionist)|magician]] causes the match to appear to float about one centimeter off the playing card. The magician may pass another playing card under or over the match to "prove" it is not being suspended by thread or wires.

==History==
This effect was originally created by Ben Harris&lt;ref name="Magic Circular"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Field|first=Matthew|date=March 2008|title=Angelo Carbone: Occupation: Magic inventor|url=http://askalexander.org/display/24741/MAGIC+CIRCULAR+VOL+102+JAN+SEP+DEC/92|journal=The Magic Circular|volume=102|pages=72|subscription=yes|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid 1980s. The effect was sold under the name ''Cosmosis: The Original Floating Match''. Harris's original effect was intended to be used with a regular playing card from a normal deck of playing cards.

Over the years, many copies of the effect have been made. Most of them include a pre-made gimmicked card to be used for the effect. It has been described as one of the most ripped-off effects in magic.&lt;ref name="Magic Circular" /&gt;

'''''Hero Envy''''' and its spinoff '''''Hero Envy: The Swass Adventures''''' are two [[United States|American]] web-based comedy series, initially produced exclusively for [[Internet]] distribution. The former was the sole venture of the production company Glint of Hope Productions. That series ran for 24 episodes and three "Christmas Annuals". After a hiatus in fall 2008, the spin-off show was produced by Reckless Sidekick Productions. The ''Hero Envy'' franchise has been described as "nerd parody." &lt;ref&gt;http://nerdcaliber.com/hero-envy-nerd-parody-at-its-best/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hero Envy'' began as the script for an uncompleted [[short film]] written by Mike Hopta and Keith Gleason in 1997. The comedy featured 2 friends named J.D. and Wally who were on a quest to find meaning in their lives after they graduate from college. In 2005, Hopta and Gleason revamped the idea and wrote four scripts they produced as 10- to 35-minute live-action web videos. Glint of Hope Productions was formed and premiered the pilot episode "Saturday Morning" in August 2005. Episodes revolved around the misadventures of J.D. and Wally. Supporting characters were Orson the science-fiction loving pacifist and Dekker the crazy horror fan.

Guest stars included professional wrestler the Smoke, Fat Momma from ''[[Who Wants to be a Superhero?]]'', musician [[Phil Labonte]], and [[Kina Dean]] from the reality show ''[[Road Rules]]''.

In May 2009 Glint of Hope Productions halted production and dissolved. That September, a new production company, Reckless Sidekick Productions formed, and began filming a new spin-off series, "Hero Envy: The Swass Adventures."

''Hero Envy: The Swass Adventures'' is a spin-off series that ran in 2009. It premiered six months after the last episode of "Hero Envy" and focused on the continuing adventures of Dekker in an alternate universe where he now lives with J.D. and a new character known only as the Toy Dealer. The storylines deal with Dekker's quest to get back to his home world and his attempt to deal with his current reality. The final episode, "Christmas Special 2009", was released in December 2009.

In 2009, Reckless Sidekick Productions began publishing an ongoing video [[podcast]] series starring Gleason and Cimino in, generally, a roundtable discussion with guests  covering a specific pop-culture topic each installment. The podcasts 15 to 30 minutes.

==Comic book==
In April 2012, Reckless Sidekick Productions released the "Hero Envy" comic book.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Written by Keith Gleason with added dialogue from Efrain Martinez and story assistance from John Cimino, the comic book is a three-part miniseries set in the universe established in the "Hero Envy" webisodes. A trade paperback compilation was released in April 2013. The story expands on the characters' backgrounds and follows them on a quest for four mystical objects that need to be used against villain El Moco-Conpan. The comic also adds an otherworldly character U-Toob, a parody of [[Marvel Comics]]' Uatu the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]. who guides the characters throughout the story. The comic includes a second story that explains the origin of El Diablo, an imaginary friend who lives in the character J.D.'s head.

==Characters==
'''J.D. Fields''' - Played by John Cimino

The rambunctious and raging hormone who sometimes doesn't know if he's 3 or 30 (and this usually happens at the expense of others)! Cares little for time, law and order, for those things mean nothing in "J.D. World." Even though he's loath to admit it, J.D. needs his best friend Wally and this sometimes comes at a huge price. An incorrigible rebel that lives for babes, beers, cartoons, and chaos, and not necessarily in that order. In an alternate dimension J.D. lives with The Toy Dealer and seems to tolerate Dekker a little more than usual (even asking him to become a roommate). He likes to change his hats depending on the situations.

'''Dekker''' - Played by Keith Gleason

Works the counter for the local comic shop "Fly on the Wall Comics." Dekker has been friends with Wally for over 10 years and they bonded over an issue of [[Hellboy]]. A loner who is a little "off" due to his militant love for blood, guts, and horror. Dekker is also up on all internet geek news because he is on [[ebay]] everyday and writing hate e-mails to studios for re-making his favorite horror movies. Recently, Dekker stole J.B.'s reality hopping razor for fun but now finds himself trapped in a parallel universe that he is trying to escape from.

'''Wallace North''' - Played by Mike Hopta

The level-headed, kind, yet sometimes gullible guy who looks for the best in everyone and in any situation. Think Charlie Brown trying to "right the wrong" like his hero [[Hal Jordan]] ([[Green Lantern]]) while maintaining his sanity in a world lost. Wally tries to live as normal of a life as possible by balancing a riled up J.D. and trying to "get it right" with his on and off again girlfriend Brooke. Known for his high-speed-joystick-trigger-fingers and an almost uncanny dedication to his comicbook heroes.

'''Orson H. Cochrane''' - Played by Kurt Loether

The lovable, somewhat-robotic science fiction companion to Wally. Orson still lives at home with his mother (but he would contend it's the bridge of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']]). Wally and Orson met in line waiting for "[[Return of the Jedi]]" tickets 20 years ago (oddly enough he still hasn't stopped complaining about the [[Ewoks]]). His extensive robotic Sci-fi techno babble can drive even the most balanced [[Jedi]] to the dark side. Orson's relationship with J.D. is a bit shakey because J.D. is very territorial when it comes to all things Wally.

An '''impersonator''' is someone who imitates or copies the behavior or actions of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/impersonator |title=Impersonator |publisher=The Free Dictionary |accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many reasons for impersonating someone:

*Entertainment: An [[entertainer]] impersonates a celebrity, generally for entertainment, and makes fun of their personal lives, recent scandals and known behavior patterns. Especially popular objects of impersonation are [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] (''see [[Elvis impersonator]]''), [[Michael Jackson]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]. Entertainers who impersonate multiple celebrities as part of their act, can be sorted into [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionists]] and celebrity impersonators.
*Crime: As part of a [[Crime|criminal act]] such as [[identity theft]]. This is usually where the criminal is trying to assume the identity of another, in order to commit [[fraud]], such as accessing confidential information, or to gain property not belonging to them. Also known as [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] and [[impostor]]s.
*[[Political decoy|Decoys]], used as a form of protection for political and military figures. This involves an impersonator who is employed (or forced) to perform during public appearances, to mislead observers.
*Sowing discord, causing people to fight, or dislike each other for social, business or political gain.
*Companionship: a [[rental family]] service provides actors portraying friends or family for platonic purposes.

==Celebrity impersonators==

[[Image:1980s Madonna style.jpg|thumb|A [[Madonna wannabe]], an impersonator of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 1980s looks and fashion style.]]

'''Celebrity impersonators''' are entertainers who look similar to [[Celebrity|celebrities]] and dress in such a way as to imitate them. Impersonators are known as look-alikes, impressionists, imitators tribute artists and wannabees. The interest may have originated with the need or desire to see a celebrity who has died.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} One of the most prominent examples of this phenomenon is the case of [[Elvis Presley]]. There are claimed to be more Elvis impersonators and tribute artists in the world than for any other celebrity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

[[Edward Moss (impersonator)|Edward Moss]] has appeared in movies and sitcoms, impersonating [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002195262_jacko03.html |work=The Seattle Times |first=Bob |last=Baker |title=King of Pop impersonator star of E! trial re-enactment |date=March 3, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709140821/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002195262_jacko03.html |archivedate=July 9, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal impersonation==

Although in a recent case, an immigrant was charged with "criminal impersonation" for using another person's [[social security number]] when signing up for a job, some courts have ruled that this is not an actual crime. The ruling hinges on whether there was harm to the other person.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |date=October 28, 2010 |url=http://www.upi.com/Using-false-SS-number-not-impersonation/80121288317800/ |title=Using false S.S. number not impersonation |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Kinniku Banzuke'''''|筋肉番付||lit. ''Muscle Ranking''}} a.k.a. '''''Unbeatable [[Banzuke]]''''' was a weekly [[Japan]]ese [[television program]] and the premier [[sports entertainment]] [[variety show]] of the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] (TBS). Its successors were {{Nihongo|''Taiiku Oukoku''|体育王国||''Physical Education Kingdom''}} and {{Nihongo|''Ougon Kinniku''|黄金筋肉||''Golden Muscle''}}. They were succeeded by ''[[:ja:マッスルミュージカル|Muscle Musical]]''. Several seasonal specials were also made, such as ''[[:ja:最強の男は誰だ!壮絶筋肉バトル!!スポーツマンNo.1決定戦|Pro Sportsman No.1]]'' and ''[[Sasuke (TV series)|Sasuke]]''.

Originally a late night Friday broadcast, the television special was popular and started airing in prime time on October 14, 1995. It was broadcast every season and gained popularity as {{Nihongo|''Sportsman No.1 Ketteisen''|スポーツマンNo.1決定戦||''Sportsman No.1 Playoffs''}}. Through various games reverting to the origins of sports, professional players and general participants challenged the limits of physical strength and technique, winning prizes if all targets were successfully destroyed.

[[Kane Kosugi]]'s [[Shaolin Temple]] training and [[:ja:大森晃|Akira Oomori]]'s [[Muay Thai]] bouts were also documented in the broadcasts. The popularity of the displays of amazing physical strength and technique by professional players and luck of general participants drove [[TV Asahi]] to move its anime time slot up one hour and caused the cancellation of {{Nihongo|''[[:ja:平成教育委員会|Heisei Kyouikuiinkai]]''|平成教育委員会||''Heisei Board of Education''}} on [[Fuji TV]].

The use of the program's [[mascot]], {{Nihongo|Kongou-kun|金剛くん||Adamantium Boy}}, originally only featured during the broadcast, expanded in 1999 into the program's opening sequence and every game's introduction. Simultaneously, a brandmark for the program, different from its logotype, was created: the English initials, "MR". However, that same autumn, only the mascot remained, and the "MR" brandmark vanished, having only appeared for that brief time.

==History==
===Sudden cancellation===

On May 5, 2002, two show participants injured their [[cervical vertebrae]] during the filming of an episode entitled "Chikarajima" ("Power Island"), an obstacle course with a temple like setting stationed outside. The accidents occurred during the "rock attack" and "rock valley" obstacle portions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In rock attack, contestants try to catch a giant ball that comes down a 15-degree slope, they must then push the ball back up the slope where a platform leads to the rock valley waterway. In rock valley, they try to walk on the ball, which weighs about 30&amp;nbsp;kg and has a diameter of 1.8 meters, across the aforementioned waterway 2.5 meters wide and 1.4 meters deep. Wei Tao, a 19-year-old Chinese freshman at Kyoto University, fell into the waterway during the rock valley obstacle. Takunori Isa, a 20-year-old junior at [[Tokai University]], was knocked down when he tried to catch the ball in rock attack and was rolled over by the ball.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

It would prove to be the final episode of ''Kinniku Banzuke''.  Show production was officially put on hiatus, and the show was effectively [[Cancellation (television)|cancelled]]. The dormant space was [[Filler (media)|filled]] with a special edition of ''[[Count Down TV]]'', ''CDTV Gold'', entitled {{Nihongo|''Za! Gekitou! Daikazoku!!''|ザ!激闘!大家族!!||''The! Intensely Fighting! Large Family!!''}}. It was revived in 2008, and aired in first-run episodes on G4 and MYX TV in America and Challenge in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== &lt;!-- Broadcasting time --&gt;Broadcast time ==
Saturday at 19:00 [[Japan Standard Time|JST]] (Except for [[:ja:テレビ山口|TV Yamaguchi]]. At first, it was not broadcast on [[:ja:テレビ高知|TV Kouchi]] either but started midway in April 2000. At that time, TV Kouchi had a time slot open on [[:ja:高知さんさんテレビ|Kouchi Sun Sun TV]] when a Fuji TV drama was moved to a different slot, and thereafter, the network started broadcasting [[TV Asahi]]'s programs at a different time. In addition, TV Yamaguchi was once a [[:ja:フジネットワーク|Fuji Network System]] affiliate and syndicated some [[Fuji TV]] programs.)

==Courses==
Courses that are defeated are then recreated in an attempt to be made more difficult and thus "unbeatable". This is why there are different versions (I, II, III, IV, V) next to some names. Sometimes an obstacle is changed between attempts to conquer this game, so there are letters (A, B) next to the versions. This is most likely done because of the injuries caused by this obstacle. Some of these events have "break zones", where any competitor who reaches that point is allowed to take a 30-second break before they must continue on with the course.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}
* '''Amazing Road''' – Competitors must cross a 15-metre-long suspended beam while avoiding six turnstiles fitted with padded bars that can knock them off.
* '''Athletic Love''' (El Amor Atlético) – Two people of a couple stand at either end of a bridge-like construct. They have 60 seconds to reach the center without falling off or using their hands. This challenge has had two victories.
* '''Bamboo Derby''' (Hongo de Bambú) (On Ultimate Banzuke renamed: "Walking Tall") I, IIA, IIB, III – Obstacle course where competitors walk on [[stilts]]. Between IIA and IIB, Green Mountain was changed to the harder Snow Mountain before being changed back into Green Mountain. This challenge has had 2 victories.
* '''Banzai 90''' – A six-person team has 90 seconds to launch one of their own onto each of four padded logs hanging several feet above the floor. When all four logs are taken, they must hold their position for 10 more seconds. The logs are of varying heights: Red – 11&amp;nbsp;ft 4 in, yellow – 10&amp;nbsp;ft 7 in, green – 10&amp;nbsp;ft 1 in, and blue – 9&amp;nbsp;ft 1 in. This challenge has had 4 victories.
* '''Daruma 7''' – A [[Daruma Otoshi|'daruma']] sits atop a stack of 7 blocks. Competitors use a [[sledgehammer]] to knock out each block from the bottom up without letting the 'daruma' (or any other section) fall off. This challenge has had 4 victories, 1 in a modified version below.  One of these victories was [[Yakult Swallows]] superstar catcher [[Atsuya Furuta]].
** '''Super Daruma''' – Modified version of Daruma 7 which has 9 blocks to knock out instead of 7.
** '''Daruma 7 Ace''' – Modified version of Daruma 7 which the blocks start out small and get larger. This version of the challenge has had 1 victory.
* '''Extra Kendama''' – Competitors play with a life-size [[kendama]]. They have 60 seconds to swing the ball onto the large cup, then onto the small cup, and finally onto the central spike without dropping the kendama.
* '''Giant Ball''' – Obstacle course where competitors stay atop a 5-foot-wide ball without ever falling off or even straying from the course. If a 5-foot-wide ball gets stuck it pothole, contestants will need to escape within the 10-second limit.
* '''Hand Walk''' I, IIa, IIb, IIIA, IIIB, IV – Obstacle course where competitors walk on their hands. This course has a break zone. Between IIIA and IIIB, the Conveyor Belt was changed to Bamboo Bridge. As for IIa and IIb, the Rolling Hills were changed to the Hills and Stairs. This challenge has had 4 victories. The fourth version only aired in Japan.
* '''Kangaroo''' – Obstacle course where competitors use a [[pogo stick]]. This course has a break zone.
* '''Like a Pierrot''' I, II, III, IV, V, Ghost – Obstacle course where competitors ride a [[unicycle]]. This event has had 8 victories, the most of any challenge.
* '''Muscle Gym''' – Two competitors have to do as many sit-ups, back extensions, and push-ups as they can in 3 minutes. This challenge was played four times; by design, there was a victory each time it was played.
* '''Nakama''' – Two people run through an obstacle course while tethered together. They have 70 seconds to reach the end.
* '''Neko de Drive''' I, II – Obstacle course involving a man transporting a woman on a [[wheelbarrow]] that looks like a cat (a "neko (cat) cart"). The contestants have 60 seconds to complete the first four obstacles and reach the break zone. After that, the time is unlimited. This is the second course to undergo a numerical upgrade change without a victor. The second version only aired in Japan.
* '''Ottoto 9''' – Obstacle course where competitors balance a metal pole on two fingers (hands in US Version). This obstacle is similar to ''Steady Voyage'' in Viking, The Ultimate Obstacle Course.  Letting your pole fall or touch any metal obstacle results in failure. This course has a break zone. This challenge has had 1 victory.
* '''Quick Muscle''' – (On Ultimate Banzuke renamed: "Push Up Showdown") Two competitors have to do as many push-ups as they can in 3 minutes. The one who does more at the end of 3 minutes is declared the champion. Any time a competitor uses improper form, the penalty light goes on, deactivating that competitor's counter for 10 seconds. By design, there is a victory each time the challenge is played; all five wins were achieved by the same competitor. In one of them, a contender bit his lips hard enough to bleed, marking the first time to show blood in that show.
* '''Seesaw 60''' – Two people stand atop a giant [[seesaw]]. They have 60 seconds to move a 10&amp;nbsp;kg barrel from one side to the other without letting either end of the seesaw touch the floor. A third person gets to call out advice to the other two people. This challenge has had 1 victory.
* '''Skateboarder''' – Obstacle course where competitors ride a [[skateboard]]. This course has a break zone, where competitors only have to take a short break. This challenge has had 1 victory.
* '''Spider Walk''' – Competitors must climb through a 79-meter-long set of parallel walls, using their arms and legs to move forward without touching the ground. This course would later become the inspiration for the "Spider Walk" and "Jumping Spider" obstacles in [[Sasuke (TV series)|Sasuke]]. This challenge has had 2 victories.
* '''Sponge Bridge''' I, II, III – Competitors have to walk atop three rows of giant foam blocks, each harder than the last. This was based on the [[Takeshi's Castle]] game 'Dominoes', and has also been used as 'Domino Hill' in stage 3 of ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|KUNOICHI]]''. This course is the first to be updated to a new edition and advance numerically without being defeated first. This challenge has had 2 victories.
* '''Super Helico''' – Obstacle course involving a [[radio-controlled helicopter]]. This course has a break zone to allow the copter's batteries to be replaced. This challenge has had 1 victory.
* '''Super Rider''' I, II, III, IV, V – Obstacle course where competitors ride a [[bicycle]]. This challenge has had 6 victories.  Two more courses were made and filmed, but never aired except in Japan (there are clips from the competition in the international versions).
* '''Strong Mama''' – A course designed specifically for women. They have 60 seconds to clear the first five obstacles. After that, time is unlimited.
* '''Trampoline''' – Competitors must bounce off of trampolines onto stacks of foam blocks. This competition has three stages, and all competitors who complete the first stage are held until all competitors attempt the stage. Afterwards, all successful competitors attempt the second stage in the same manner.
* '''Untouchable''' – Four contestants face off, two at a time, 1-on-1 in a caged wrestling competition, with 3 batons each strapped to their bodies, on their back and each leg. The competitors must remove 2 out of 3 batons off of the other to win a match. After a baton is removed, competition ceases temporarily as the baton is placed in a box. The first person to win 2 matches is placed on the Banzuke. This challenge has had 1 victory.

"Struck Out", "Kick Target", etc. – The contest for the 2 million [[Japanese yen|yen]] prize consisted of many games that formed the "2 Million Yen Dream Plan".

'''Mr.Goodliving''' Ltd. was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[video game developer]] and a [[video game publisher]] based in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. It was founded in 1999, and acquired by [[RealNetworks]] on 6 May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = REALNETWORKS ENTERS MOBILE GAMES MARKET: ACQUIRES EUROPEAN-BASED MR. GOODLIVING LTD | url = http://investor.realnetworks.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1299933-05-2342 | publisher = investor.realnetworks.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr.Goodliving was focused on games for [[mobile phones]], the [[iPhone]] and other high-end portable devices.

The company was best known for the casual sports game franchise Playman Sports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Playman Sports | url = http://www.playmansports.com | publisher = www.playmansports.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; spanning numerous incarnations such as Playman Summer Games, Playman Winter Games and Playman World Soccer. Along with original [[intellectual property]], the company worked with several high-profile licenses such as Trivial Pursuit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Trivial Pursuit: Deluxe Edition Review | url = http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Mobile/Trivial+Pursuit%3A+Deluxe+Edition/review.asp?c=5227 | publisher = www.pocketgamer.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; South Park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = South Park Mega Millionaire Review | url = http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Mobile/South+Park+Mega+Millionaire/review.asp?c=15597 | publisher = www.pocketgamer.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scrabble,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Scrabble Mobile Review | url = http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Mobile/Scrabble+Mobile/review.asp?c=10656&amp;srch=scrabble | publisher = www.pocketgamer.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Vancouver 2010 Review | url = http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Mobile/Vancouver+2010/review.asp?c=17790 | publisher = www.pocketgamer.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its games, Mr.Goodliving developed EMERGE, a proprietary development platform which enables rapid and scalable publishing of games to more than 2000 handsets in 20 languages.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

On February 9, 2011, Real unexpectedly announced to close Mr.Goodliving.&lt;ref&gt;http://dome.fi/pelit/uutiset/real-sulkee-suomalaisen-mr-goodliving-pelikehittajan-potkut-44lle&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music journalism''' (or "'''music criticism'''") is media criticism and reporting about popular [[music]] topics, including [[pop music]], [[rock music]], and related styles. Journalists began writing about music in the eighteenth century, providing commentary on what is now thought of as [[classical music]]. In the 2000s, a more prominent branch of music journalism is an aspect of [[entertainment journalism]], covering [[popular music]] and including profiles of [[singer]]s and [[Band (music)|band]]s, live concert, and [[album]] reviews.

==Origins in classical music criticism==
[[File:151 Franck Hector Berlioz.JPG|upright|thumb|[[Hector Berlioz]], active as a music journalist in Paris in the 1830s and 1840s]]
Music journalism has its roots in [[classical music|classical]] [[music criticism]], which has traditionally comprised the study, discussion, evaluation, and interpretation of music that has been composed and notated in a [[sheet music|score]] and the evaluation of the performance of classical songs and pieces, such as [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[concerto]]s .

Before about the 1840s, reporting on music was either done by musical journals, such as ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' (later the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''), founded by [[Robert Schumann]], and in London journals such as ''[[The Musical Times]]'' (founded in 1844 as ''The Musical Times and Singing-class Circular''); or else by reporters at general newspapers where music did not form part of the central objectives of the publication. An influential English 19th-century music critic, for example, was [[James William Davison]] of ''[[The Times]].'' The composer [[Hector Berlioz]] also wrote reviews and criticisms for the Paris press of the 1830s and 1840s.&lt;ref name=bujic/&gt;

Modern [[art music]] journalism is often informed by [[music theory]] consideration of the many diverse elements of a musical piece or performance, including (as regards a [[musical composition]]) its form and style, and for performance, standards of technique and expression. These standards were expressed, for example, in journals such as ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'' founded by [[Robert Schumann]], and are continued today in the columns of serious [[newspaper]]s and journals such as ''[[The Musical Times]]''.&lt;ref name=bujic&gt;Bujić, Bojan (n.d.), "Criticism of Music" in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', [[Oxford Music Online]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors&amp;mdash;including growth of education, the influence of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement generally and in music, popularization (including the 'star-status' of many performers such as [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]]), among others&amp;mdash;led to an increasing interest in music among non-specialist journals, and an increase in the number of critics by profession of varying degrees of competence and integrity. The 1840s could be considered a turning point, in that music critics after the 1840s generally were not also practicing musicians.&lt;ref name=bujic/&gt; However, counterexamples include [[Alfred Brendel]], [[Charles Rosen]], [[Paul Hindemith]], and [[Ernst Krenek]]; all of whom were modern practitioners of the classical music tradition who also write (or wrote) on music.

==Classical==
In the early 1980s, a decline in the quantity of classical criticism began occurring "when classical-music criticism visibly started to disappear" from the media. At that time, magazines such as ''Time'' and ''Vanity Fair'' employed classical music critics, but by the early 1990s, classical critics were dropped in many magazines, in part due to "a decline of interest in classical music, especially among younger people".&lt;ref&gt;Sandow, Greg, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118194664260737253 "Yes, Classical-Music Criticism Is in Decline but the Last Thing the Industry Should Do Is Blame the Press"], ''Wall Street Journal''. Accessed on March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also of concern in classical music journalism was how American reviewers can write about ethnic and folk music from cultures other than their own, such as Indian [[raga]]s and traditional Japanese works.&lt;ref name=schick&gt;{{cite book |last=Schick |first=Robert D. |title=Classical Music Criticism: With a Chapter on Reviewing Ethnic Music |location=New York |publisher=Garland |year=1996 |pages=166–176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OyO3jcUpp4UC&amp;pg=PA173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|viii,173}} In 1990, the World Music Institute interviewed four ''[[New York Times]]'' music critics who came up with the following criteria on how to approach ethnic music:

# A review should relate the music to other kinds of music that readers know, to help them understand better what the program was about.
# "The performers [should] be treated as human beings and their music [should] be treated as human activity rather than a mystical or mysterious phenomenon."
# The review should show an understanding of the music's cultural backgrounds and intentions.&lt;ref name=schick/&gt;{{rp|173–74}}

A key finding in a 2005 study of arts journalism in America was that the profile of the "average classical music critic is a white, 52-year old male, with a graduate degree".&lt;ref name=classicalcritic&gt;{{cite conference |last1=McGill |first1=Lawrence |first2=Willa J. |last2=Conrad |first3=Donald |last3=Rosenberg |first4=András |last4=Szántó |title=The Classical Music Critic: A Survey of Music Critics at General-Interest and Specialized News Publications in America |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Music Critics Association of North America |conference=National Arts Journalism Program |year=2005 |url=http://www.mcana.org/images/Critics_Survey_PDF.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911221451/http://www.mcana.org/images/Critics_Survey_PDF.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} Demographics indicated that the group was 74% male, 92% white, and 64% had earned a graduate degree.&lt;ref name=classicalcritic/&gt;{{rp|15}} One critic of the study pointed out that because all newspapers were included, including low-circulation regional papers, the female representation of 26% misrepresented the actual scarcity, in that the "large US papers, which are the ones that influence public opinion, have virtually no women classical music critics", with the notable exceptions of [[Anne Midgette]] in the ''New York Times'' and Wynne Delacoma in the ''Chicago Sun-Times''.&lt;ref name=iawmlist&gt;{{cite mailing list|first=William |last=Osborne |url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/women-critics.htm |title=Women Music Critics |mailing-list=IAWMLIST |publisher=International Alliance for Women in Music |date=June 11, 2005 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that classical music criticism, which it characterized as "a high-minded endeavor that has been around at least as long as newspapers", had undergone "a series of hits in recent months" with the elimination, downgrading, or redefinition of critics' jobs at newspapers in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and elsewhere, citing ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine's [[Peter G. Davis]], "one of the most respected voices of the craft, [who] said he had been forced out after 26 years".&lt;ref name="Newspapers Trimming Classical Critics 2007"&gt;Wakin, Daniel J., "Newspapers Trimming Classical Critics", ''The New York Times'', June 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing "robust analysis, commentary and reportage as vital to the health of the art form", ''The New York Times'' stated in 2007 that it continued to maintain "a staff of three full-time classical music critics and three freelancers", noting also that classical music criticism had become increasingly available on blogs, and that a number of other major newspapers "still have full-time classical music critics", including (in 2007) the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', and ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.&lt;ref name="Newspapers Trimming Classical Critics 2007" /&gt;

===20th century rock criticism===
Music writers only started "treating pop and rock music seriously" in 1964 "after the breakthrough of [[the Beatles]]".&lt;ref name=jones2002&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=Steve|title=Pop Music and the Press|year=2002|url= https://books.google.com/books?vid=N-ViwZnnR3oC |isbn=9781566399661|publisher=Temple University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45}}{{Attribution needed|date=November 2018}} In their book ''Rock Criticism from the Beginning'', Ulf Lindberg and his co-writers say that rock criticism appears to have been "slower to develop in the U.S. than in England".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ulf|last1=Lindberg|first2=Gestur|last2=Guomundsson|first3=Morten|last3=Michelsen|first4=Hans |last4=Weisethaunet|title=Rock Criticism from the Beginning: Amusers, Bruisers, and Cool-Headed Cruisers |publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York, NY|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8204-7490-8|p=73|ref={{SfnRef|Lindberg et al.|2005}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the early British music magazines, ''[[Melody Maker]]'', complained in 1967 about how "newspapers and magazines are continually hammering [i.e., attacking] [[pop music]]".&lt;ref name=jones2002/&gt;{{rp|116}} From 1964, ''Melody Maker'' led its rival publications in terms of approaching music and musicians as a subject for serious study rather than merely entertainment. Staff reporters such as [[Chris Welch]] and [[Ray Coleman]] applied a perspective previously reserved for jazz artists to the rise of American-influenced local rock and pop groups, anticipating the advent of rock critics.{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|pp=85, 88, 89–91}} Among Britain's broadsheet newspapers, pop music gained exposure in the arts section of ''[[The Times]]'' when [[William Mann (critic)|William Mann]], the paper's [[classical music]] critic, wrote an appreciation of the Beatles in December 1963.{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|p=72}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gendron|first=Bernard|title=Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-0-226-28737-9|ref=harv|pp=14, 164–65, 341}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1965, ''[[The Observer]]'', the country's highbrow Sunday newspaper, signalled a reversal of the establishment's cultural snobbery towards pop music by appointing [[George Melly]] as its "critic of pop culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher|last=Bray|title=1965: The Year Modern Britain Was Born|year=2014|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=London|isbn=978-1-84983-387-5|pp=262–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Tony Palmer]]'s arrival at ''The Observer'',{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|p=125fn}} the first daily newspaper to employ a dedicated rock critic was ''[[The Guardian]]'', with the appointment of [[Geoffrey Cannon]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Writer/geoffrey-cannon/|title=Geoffrey Cannon|publisher=[[Rock's Backpages]]|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Melody Maker''{{'}}s writers advocated the new forms of pop music of the late 1960s. "By 1999, the 'quality' press was regularly carrying reviews of popular music gigs and albums", which had a "key role in keeping pop" in the public eye. As more pop music critics began writing, this had the effect of "legitimating pop as an art form"; as a result, "newspaper coverage shifted towards pop as music rather than pop as social phenomenon".&lt;ref name=jones2002/&gt;{{rp|129}}{{Attribution needed|date=November 2018}}

In the world of pop music criticism, there has tended to be a quick turnover. The "pop music industry" expects that any particular rock critic will likely disappear from popular view within five years; in contrast, according to author Mark Fenster, the "stars" of rock criticism are more likely to have long careers with "book contracts, featured columns, and editorial and staff positions at magazines and newspapers".&lt;ref name=fenster-jones2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Fenster|first=Mark|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=Steve|chapter=Consumers' Guides: The Political Economy of the Music Press and the Democracy of Critical Discourse |page=85 |title=Pop Music and the Press|year=2002|url= https://books.google.com/books?vid=N-ViwZnnR3oC&amp;pg=PA85 |isbn=9781566399661|publisher=Temple University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Richard Goldstein - Pop Conference 2015 - 02 (17182432526).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Richard Goldstein (pictured at the 2015 [[EMP Museum|EMP]] Pop Conference) was the first American music critic to focus on rock music.]]
Author Bernard Gendron writes that in the United States "the emergence of a 'serious' rock press and the rock critic" began in 1966, presaged by [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]], the [[folk music]] critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', writing articles praising the Beatles and [[Bob Dylan]], the last of whom had just embraced rock 'n' roll by performing with electric backing at the [[1965 Newport Folk Festival]].{{sfn|Gendron|2002|p=190}} [[Paul Williams (journalist)|Paul Williams]], an eighteen-year-old student, launched the pop journal ''[[Crawdaddy (magazine)|Crawdaddy!]]'' in February 1966; in June, [[Richard Goldstein (writer born 1944)|Richard Goldstein]], a recent graduate and [[New Journalism]] writer, debuted his "Pop Eye" column in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', which Gendron describes as "the first regular column on rock 'n' roll ... to appear in an established cultural publication".{{sfn|Gendron|2002|p=191}} Rock journalist [[Clinton Heylin]], in his role as editor of ''The Penguin Book of Rock &amp; Roll Writing'', cites "the true genesis of rock criticism" to the emergence of ''Crawdaddy!''{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|pp=73–74}} Lindberg et al. say that, while Williams is widely considered to be the first American rock critic, he "nevertheless looked to England for material".{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|p=74}}

According to Gendron, Goldstein's most significant early pieces were a "manifesto" on rock 'n' roll and "pop aestheticism", and a laudatory assessment of the Beatles' ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' album. Published in late August, the latter article provided "the first substantial rock review devoted to one album to appear in any nonrock magazine with accreditory power".{{sfn|Gendron|2002|p=192}} Whereas Williams could be sure of a sympathetic readership, given the nature of his publication, Goldstein's task was to win over a more highbrow readership to the artistic merits of contemporary pop music.{{sfn|Gendron|2002|p=192}} At this time, both Goldstein and Williams gained considerable renown in the cultural mainstream{{sfn|Gendron|2002|p=193}} and were the subject of profile articles in ''[[Newsweek]]''.{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|p=118}}

The emergence of rock journalism coincided with an attempt to position rock music, particularly the Beatles' work, in the American cultural landscape.{{sfn|Gendron|2002|pp=193–94}}{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|pp=118–19}} The critical discourse was further heightened by the respectful coverage afforded the genre in mainstream publications such as ''Newsweek'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' in the months leading up to and following the release of the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' album in June 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2017/05/the-beatles-sgt-peppers-was-a-masterpiece-of-timing.html|first=Jack|last=Hamilton|title=''Sgt. Pepper''{{'}}s Timing Was As Good As Its Music|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=24 May 2017|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gendron|2002|pp=194–95}} Within this discourse, [[Richard Meltzer]], in an essay for ''Crawdaddy!'' in March, challenged the highbrow aesthetic of rock proposed by Goldstein. The latter's mixed review of ''Sgt. Pepper'' in ''The New York Times'' was similarly the subject of journalistic debate, and invited reprisals from musicologists, composers and cultural commentators.{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|pp=118–19}}

Among other young American writers who became pop columnists following Goldstein's appointment were [[Robert Christgau]] (at ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', from June 1967), [[Ellen Willis]] (''[[The New Yorker]]'', March 1968) and [[Ellen Sander]] (''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'', October 1968).{{sfn|Gendron|2002|p=193}} Christgau was the "originator of the 'consumer guide' approach to pop music reviews", an approach that was designed to help readers decide whether to buy a new album.&lt;ref name=jones2002/&gt;{{rp|4}}{{Attribution needed|date=November 2018}}

According to popular music academic Roy Shuker in 1994, music reference books such as ''[[The Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'' and ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''  played a role in the rise of rock critics as tastemakers in the music industry, "constructing their own version of the traditional [[High culture|high]]/[[low culture]] split, usually around notions of artistic integrity, authenticity, and the nature of commercialism". These review collections, Shuker continues, "became bibles in the field, establishing orthodoxies as to the relative value of various styles or genres and pantheons of artists. Record collectors and enthusiasts, and specialisation and secondhand record shops, inevitably have well-thumbed copies of these and similar volumes close at hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shuker|first=Roy|year=1994|title=Understanding Popular Music|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=0415107229|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the realm of rock music, as in that of classical music,&lt;ref name=slonimsky&gt;{{cite book|last=Slonimsky|first=Nicolas|authorlink=Nicolas Slonimsky|title=Lexicon of Musical Invective|isbn=978-0-393-32009-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=JjW66BVA-j0C}} (citing many examples of insults in both directions)&lt;/ref&gt; critics have not always been respected by their subjects. [[Frank Zappa]] declared that "Most rock journalism is people who can't write, interviewing people who can't talk, for people who can't read." In the [[Guns N' Roses]] song "[[Get in the Ring]]", [[Axl Rose]] verbally attacked critics who gave the band negative reviews because of their actions on stage; such critics as [[Andy Secher]], Mick Wall and [[Bob Guccione Jr.]] were mentioned by name.

===Critical trends of the 21st century===

====2000s====
In the 2000s, online music bloggers began to supplement, and to some degree displace, music journalists in print media.&lt;ref name=edlund/&gt; In 2006, Martin Edlund of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' criticized the trend, arguing that while the "Internet has democratized music criticism, it seems it's also spread its penchant for uncritical hype".&lt;ref name=edlund&gt;Edlund, Martin. [http://www.nysun.com/arts/not-all-they-were-blogged-up-to-be/33913/ "Not All They Were Blogged Up To Be"]. ''The New York Sun''. June 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Wilson (writer)|Carl Wilson]] described "an upsurge in pro-pop sentiment among critics" during the early 2000s, writing that a "new generation [of music critics] moved into positions of critical influence" and then "mounted a wholesale critique against the syndrome of measuring all popular music by the norms of rock culture".&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, Tom. [http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7703-the-decade-in-pop/2/ "The Decade in Pop"]. ''Pitchfork'' articles. August 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine writer [[Jody Rosen]] discussed the 2000s-era trends in pop music criticism in his article "The Perils of Poptimism". Rosen noted that much of the debate is centered on a perception that rock critics regard rock as "normative ... the standard state of popular music ... to which everything else is compared".&lt;ref name=rosen&gt;Rosen, Jody. [http://www.slate.com/id/2141418/ "The Perils of Poptimism"]. ''Slate'' magazine. May 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; At a 2006 pop critic conference, attendees discussed their "guilty pop pleasures, reconsidering musicians ([[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]], [[Dan Fogelberg]], [[Phil Collins]]) and genres ([[blue-eyed soul]], [[Elevator music|Muzak]])" which rock critics have long dismissed as lightweight, commercial music. Rosen stated that "this new critical paradigm" is called "popism" – or, more evocatively (and goofily), "poptimism". The poptimism approach states: "Pop (and, especially, hip-hop) producers are as important as rock auteurs, [[Beyoncé]] is as worthy of serious consideration as [[Bruce Springsteen]], and ascribing shame to pop pleasure is itself a shameful act."&lt;ref name=rosen/&gt;

[[File:Ann Powers 01A.jpg|thumb|upright|American pop music critic Ann Powers]]
In 2008, [[Ann Powers]] of the ''Los Angeles Times'' argued that pop music critics "have always been contrarians", because "pop music [criticism] rose up as a challenge to taste hierarchies, and has remained a pugilistic, exhibitionist business throughout pop's own evolution".&lt;ref name=powers2008&gt;[[Ann Powers|Powers, Ann]]. [http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/27/entertainment/ca-pop27 "Bratty by nature"]. ''Los Angeles Times''. July 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Powers claimed that "[i]nsults, rejections of others' authority, bratty assertions of superior knowledge and even threats of physical violence are the stuff of which pop criticism is made", while at the same time, the "best [pop criticism] also offers loving appreciation and profound insights about how music creates and collides with our everyday realities".&lt;ref name=powers2008/&gt; She stated that pop criticism developed as a "slap at the establishment, at publications such as the hippie homestead ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and the rawker outpost ''[[Creem]]''", adding that the "1980s generation" of post-punk indie rockers had in the mid-2000s "been taken down by younger 'poptimists,' who argue that lovers of underground rock are elitists for not embracing the more multicultural mainstream".&lt;ref name=powers2008/&gt; Powers likened the poptimist critics' debates about bands and styles to a "scrum in rugby", in that "[e]verybody pushes against everybody else, and we move forward in a huge blob of vehement opinion and mutual judgment".&lt;ref name=powers2008 /&gt;

====2010s====
Music critic and indie pop musician [[Scott Miller (pop musician)|Scott Miller]], in his 2010 book ''[[Music: What Happened?]]'', suggested, "Part of the problem is that a lot of vital pop music is made by 22-year-olds who enjoy shock value, and it's pathetic when their elders are cornered into unalloyed reverence". Miller suggested that critics could navigate this problem by being prepared "to give young artists credit for terrific music without being intimidated into a frame of mind where dark subject matter always gets a passing grade", stating that a critic should be able to call a young artist "a musical genius" while "in the same breath declaring that his or her lyrics are morally objectionable."&lt;ref name=mwh2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Scott|authorlink=Scott Miller (pop musician)|title=Music: What Happened?|year=2010|publisher=125 Records|isbn=9780615381961|url=http://www.loudfamily.com/mwh.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} Reacting to the state of pop music criticism, Miller identified a major issue as critics' failure to "credit an artist with getting a feeling across", specifically pointing out critic [[Lester Bangs]] as "a ball of emotion at all times", who nonetheless "never really related to his favorite artists as people who develop a skill of conveying feelings. You don't feel that he comfortably acknowledged being moved as a result of their honest work. Artists in his writing were vaguely ridiculous, fascinating primitives, embodying an archetype by accident of nature."&lt;ref name=mwh2010 /&gt;

''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]''{{'}}s Tracy Moore, in 2014, suggested that one of the virtues of writing about how music made one feel, in contrast with linking it to the sounds of other artists, was to avoid excluding readers who may not have musical knowledge as broad as that of the writer.&lt;ref name=moore2014 /&gt; In contrast, Miller believed that analytical readers would appreciate "more music talk in music criticism", suggesting that "sensitively modest doses" of musical analysis would provide helpful support for a conclusion "that great melody writing occurred or it didn't". For example, Miller noted that critics rarely "identify catchy melodies as specific passages within a song", in the way that working musicians might discuss "the A-minor in the second measure of the chorus".

Stevie Chick, a writer who teaches music journalism at [[City University London]], said, "I think more than any other journalism, music journalism has got a really powerful creative writing quotient to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reid |first=Alastair |date=March 22, 2013 |title=How To: Get Into Music Journalism |work=Journalism.co.uk |publisher=Mousetrap Media Ltd |url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/skills/how-to-get-into-music-journalism/s7/a552475/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tris McCall]] of the ''[[Newark Star-Ledger]]'' discussed his approach to music criticism in a 2010 interview, stating, "Most of us [critics] begin writing about music because we love it so much. We can't wait to tell our friends and neighbors about what we're hearing."&lt;ref name=jci2010&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jerseycityindependent.com/2010/05/18/jersey-citys-tris-mccall-joins-the-star-ledger/|date=May 18, 2010|newspaper=Jersey City Independent|first=Jon|last=Whiten|title=Jersey City’s Tris McCall Joins the Star-Ledger|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622032840/http://www.jerseycityindependent.com/2010/05/18/jersey-citys-tris-mccall-joins-the-star-ledger|archivedate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to McCall, even over the course of a long professional career, the enthusiastic impulse to share "never fades".&lt;ref name=jci2010/&gt; McCall expressed his interest in "examining why people respond to what they respond to. I hazard guesses. Sometimes I'm wrong, but I hope I'm always provocative."&lt;ref name=jci2010/&gt;

===Gender and race theory===

Applying [[critical theory]] (''e.g.'', critical gender studies and [[critical race theory]]) to music journalism, some academic writers suggest that mutual disrespect between critics and artists is one of many negative effects of [[rockism]]. In 2004, critic [[Kelefa Sanneh]] defined "rockism" as "idolizing the authentic old legend (or underground hero) while mocking the latest pop star".&lt;ref name=brooks2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Daphne A.|title=The Write to Rock: Racial Mythologies, Feminist Theory and the Pleasures of Rock Music Criticism|year=2008|journal=Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture|volume=12|pages=54–62 |doi=10.1353/wam.0.0002|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/women_and_music/v012/12.brooks.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}} Music journalism "infected" with rockism has become, according to [[Yale University|Yale]] professor Daphne Brooks,&lt;ref name=yaleafam&gt;{{cite web |title=Daphne Brooks |work=Department of African American Studies |publisher=Yale University |year=2015–16 |url=http://afamstudies.yale.edu/people/daphne-brooks |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709221923/http://afamstudies.yale.edu/people/daphne-brooks |archivedate=2015-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a challenge "for those of us concerned with historical memory and popular music performance".&lt;ref name=brooks2008/&gt;{{rp|57–58}}

[[Simon Frith]] said that pop and rock music "are closely associated with gender; that is, with conventions of male and female behaviour".&lt;ref name=Frith2001&gt;Frith, Simon, "Pop Music" in S. Frith, W. Stray and J. Street, ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock]]'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Holly Kruse, both popular music articles and academic articles about pop music are usually written from "masculine subject positions".&lt;ref name=jones2002/&gt;{{rp|134}} [[Kembrew McLeod]] analyzed terms used by critics to differentiate between pop music and rock, finding a gendered dichotomy in descriptions of "'serious,' 'raw,' and 'sincere' rock music as distinguished from 'trivial', 'fluffy,' and 'formulaic' pop music".&lt;ref name=mcleod-jones2002&gt;{{cite book|last=McLeod|first=Kembrew|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=Steve|chapter=Between Rock and a Hard Place: Gender and Rock Criticism |page=96|title=Pop Music and the Press|year=2002|url= https://books.google.com/books?vid=N-ViwZnnR3oC&amp;pg=PA96|isbn=9781566399661|publisher=Temple University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; McLeod found that a likely cause of this dichotomy was the lack of women writing in music journalism: "By 1999, the number of female editors or senior writers at ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' hovered around a whopping 15%, [while] at ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' and ''[[Ray Gun (magazine)|Raygun]]'', [it was] roughly 20%."&lt;ref&gt;McLeod (2002) at 94, quoted in {{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Marion |chapter=Meaning Making in the Press |title=Gender in the Music Industry: Rock, Discourse, and Girl Power |location=Aldershot, Hampshire, England |year= 2007 |page=67 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd |isbn=9780754638629 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eMtDpy85IC4C&amp;pg=PA67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism associated with gender was graphically discussed in a 2014 ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'' article about the struggles of [[Women in music#Music critics|women in music journalism]], written by music critic Tracy Moore, previously an editor at the ''[[Nashville Scene]]''.&lt;ref name=moore2014&gt;{{cite web|author=Moore, Tracy |date=March 20, 2014 |title=Oh, the Unbelievable Shit You Get Writing About Music as a Woman |work=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] |url=http://jezebel.com/oh-the-unbelievable-shit-you-get-writing-about-music-a-1547444869 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore described how another female music blogger, an "admitted outsider" who threatened no stereotypes, was greeted with enthusiasm by men, in contrast with Moore's own experiences as a self-described "insider" who was nevertheless expected to "prove" or "earn" her way into a male-dominated journalism scene.&lt;ref name=moore2014 /&gt;

According to Anwen Crawford, music critic for Australia's ''[[The Monthly]]'', the "problem for women [popular music critics] is that our role in popular music was codified long ago"; as a result, "most famous rock-music critics – Robert Christgau, [[Greil Marcus]], [[Lester Bangs]], [[Nick Kent]] – are all male".&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crawford |first=Anwen |title=The World Needs Female Rock Critics |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |date=May 26, 2015 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-world-needs-female-rock-critics }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford points to "[t]he [[record store]], the [[guitar shop]], and now [[social media]]: when it comes to popular music, these places become stages for the display of male prowess", and adds, "Female expertise, when it appears, is repeatedly dismissed as fraudulent. Every woman who has ever ventured an opinion on popular music could give you some variation [of this experience] ...and becoming a recognized 'expert' (a musician, a critic) will not save [women] from accusations of fakery."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

Daphne Brooks, in her 2008 article "The Write to Rock: Racial Mythologies, Feminist Theory, and the Pleasures of Rock Music Criticism", wrote that in order to restructure music criticism, one must "focus on multiple ''counter''narratives" to break away from racial and gender biases as embodied in "contemporary cultural fetishizations of white male performative virtuosity and latent black male innovations".&lt;ref name=brooks2008/&gt;{{rp|55}} Brooks focused on "the ways that rock music criticism has shaped and continues to shape our understandings of racialized music encounters, and what are the alternative stories that we might tell".&lt;ref name=brooks2008/&gt;{{rp|55–56}} Brooks pointed to Christgau's statement that, after the Beatles' arrival in America, "rock criticism embraced a dream or metaphor of perpetual revolution. Worthwhile bands were supposed to change people's lives, preferably for the better. If they failed to do so, that meant they didn't matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christgau |first=Robert |chapter=A History of Rock Criticism |page=142 |title=National Arts Journalism Program: Reporting the Arts II: News Coverage of Arts and Culture in America |editor1-first=András |editor1-last=Szántó |editor2-first=Daniel S. |editor2-last=Levy |editor3-first=Andrew |editor3-last=Tyndall |location=New York |publisher=NAJP at Columbia University |year=2003 }} Quoted in {{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Daphne A.|title=The Write to Rock: Racial Mythologies, Feminist Theory and the Pleasures of Rock Music Criticism|year=2008|journal=Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture|volume=12|page=56|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/women_and_music/v012/12.brooks.html }} (ellipses and internal quotes omitted)&lt;/ref&gt; Unsurprisingly, according to Brooks, "the history of women who've been sustaining a tradition of writing about rock since the 60's" has been "largely hidden in American culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Evelyn |editor1-last=McDonnell |editor2-first=Ann |editor2-last=Powers |title=Rock She Wrote: Women Write about Rock, Pop, and Rap |location=New York |publisher=Cooper Square Press |year=1999 |page=6 }} Quoted in {{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Daphne A.|title=The Write to Rock: Racial Mythologies, Feminist Theory and the Pleasures of Rock Music Criticism|year=2008|journal=Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture|volume=12|page=58|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/women_and_music/v012/12.brooks.html }} (ellipses and internal quotes omitted)&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks theorized that perceptions of female artists of color might be different if there were more women of color writing about them, and praised [[Ellen Willis]] as a significant feminist critic of rock's classic era.&lt;ref name=brooks2008/&gt;{{rp|58–59}} Willis, who was a columnist for the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' from 1968 to 1975, believed society could be enlightened by the "ecstatic experience" of visions expressed through music's rhythm and noise and that such joy would lead people to different ways of sharing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Powers|Powers, Ann]]. [https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/women_and_music/v012/12.powers.pdf "Spy in the House of Love"]&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks wrote that "the confluence of cultural studies, rock studies, and third wave feminist critical studies makes it possible now more than ever to continue to critique and reinterrogate the form and content of popular music histories".&lt;ref name=brooks2008/&gt;{{rp|58}} In Brooks' view, "By bravely breaking open dense equations of gender, class, power, and subcultural music scenes", music journalists, activists and critics such as Ellen Willis have been "able to brilliantly, like no one before [them], challenge the intellectual and political activism and agency" of the entire music industry.&lt;ref name=brooks2008/&gt;{{rp|58}}

The editorial board of the magazine in the Soviet era included those figures recognized by the state.&lt;ref name=ezam/&gt; The first chief editor was Labory Kalmanson who was also known as G.

==Content==
''Oktyabr'' has serialized various novels, published poems and other articles about movies and societal issues. Due to such a wide coverage, the magazine is compared to the 19th century edition of ''[[Edinburgh Review]]''.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; in the late 1970s, [[Anatoly Rybakov]]’s novel, ''Heavy Sands'', was serialized in the monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Soviet Writing|journal=Commentary Magazine|date=October 1979|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/soviet-writing/|accessdate=4 October 2013|author=Ilya Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Life and Fate]]'', a novel written by [[Vasily Grossman]], was first published in the magazine in 1988.&lt;ref name=bkel/&gt;&lt;ref name=jtd89/&gt; This novel was one of the forbidden literary works in the country and therefore, the magazine became among the publications publishing previously forbidden books in the [[glasnost]] period.&lt;ref name=Brudny2009&gt;{{cite book|author=Yitzhak M Brudny|title=Reinventing Russia: Russian Nationalism and the Soviet State, 1953-1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ih37ye5sJGYC&amp;pg=PA198|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02896-8|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the magazine published [[Vasili Aksyonov]]'s novel ''Moskva-kva-kva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vasili Aksyonov|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/text?realm=name&amp;field=bio&amp;q=Oktyabr|work=IMDb|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monthly also published poems of significant and state-recognized poets in the Soviet era, forming the image of Soviet poetry, and works on [[literary criticism]].&lt;ref name=ezam/&gt;

In addition to literary works, in the 1960s the magazine covered articles on [[Soviet films]], focusing on the merits of these movies.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; Mikhail Antonov's a seminal essay, "So What Is Happening to Us?",  was published in ''Oktyabr'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Everything you think you know about the collapse of the Soviet Union is wrong|url=http://www.aei.org/article/foreign-and-defense-policy/regional/europe/everything-you-think-you-know-about-the-collapse-of-the-soviet-union-is-wrong/|work=American Enterprise Institute|accessdate=4 October 2013|author=Leon Aron|date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the magazine published a posthumous work, ''Forever Flowing'', by Vasily Grossman,&lt;ref name=hos&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey A.

But all cruelty committed in the country has become the tragic burden of Vladimir Ilych."&lt;ref name=jtd89/&gt; The article was written long before, but it was one of the first overt criticisms against [[Lenin]].&lt;ref name=jtd89/&gt; Thus, it marked a serious challenge process towards the past of the country, especially Lenin's legacy.&lt;ref name=hos/&gt;

A '''parody''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ær|ə|d|i}}); also called a '''spoof''', '''send-up''', '''take-off''', '''lampoon''', '''play on (something)''', '''caricature''', or '''joke''' is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an [[original work]]—its subject, author, style, or some other target—by means of [[satire|satiric]] or [[irony|ironic]] [[imitation]]. As the literary theorist [[Linda Hutcheon]] puts it, "parody ... is imitation, not always at the expense of the parodied text." Another critic, Simon Dentith, defines parody as "any cultural practice which provides a relatively [[polemic]]al allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice."&lt;ref&gt;Dentith (2000) p.9&lt;/ref&gt;
Parody may be found in art or culture, including [[literature]], [[parody music|music]] (although "parody" in music has an earlier, somewhat different meaning than for other art forms), [[animation]], [[Video game|gaming]], and [[film]].

The writer and critic [[John Gross]] observes in his ''Oxford Book of Parodies'', that parody seems to flourish on territory somewhere between [[pastiche]] ("a composition in another artist's manner, without satirical intent") and [[burlesque]] (which "fools around with the material of high literature and adapts it to low ends").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.M.W.

==Origins==
According to [[Aristotle]] (''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', ii. 5), [[Hegemon of Thasos]] was the inventor of a kind of parody; by slightly altering the wording in well-known poems he transformed the sublime into the ridiculous. In ancient [[Greek literature]], a ''parodia'' was a narrative poem imitating the style and prosody of [[Epic poetry|epic]]s "but treating light, satirical or [[mock-heroic]] subjects."&lt;ref&gt;(Denith, 10)&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the components of the Greek word are παρά ''para'' "beside, counter, against" and ᾠδή ''oide'' "song." Thus, the original Greek word παρῳδία ''parodia'' has sometimes been taken to mean "counter-song", an imitation that is set against the original. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'', for example, defines parody as imitation "turned as to produce a ridiculous effect."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hutcheon, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Because ''par-'' also has the non-antagonistic meaning of ''beside'', "there is nothing in ''parodia'' to necessitate the inclusion of a concept of ridicule."&lt;ref&gt;(Hutcheon, 32)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Comedy]] contained parody, even the gods could be made fun of. ''[[The Frogs]]'' portrays the hero-turned-god [[Heracles]] as a glutton and the God of Drama [[Dionysus]] as cowardly and unintelligent. The traditional trip to the Underworld story is parodied as Dionysus dresses as Heracles to go to the Underworld, in an attempt to bring back a Poet to save Athens.

In the 2nd century AD, [[Lucian of Samosata]], a Greek-language writer in [[Syria]], created a parody of travel/geography texts like [[Indica (Ctesias)|Indica]] and [[The Odyssey]]. He described the authors of such accounts as liars who had never traveled, nor talked to any credible person who had. In his ironically named book [[True History]] Lucian delivers a story which exaggerates the hyperbole and improbable claims of those stories. Sometimes described as the first [[Science Fiction]], along the lines of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]], the [[Character (arts)|characters]] travel to the moon, engage in interplanetary war with the help of aliens they meet there, and then return to the earth to experience civilization inside a 200 mile long creature generally interpreted as being a whale. This is a parody of [[Ctesias]]' claims that India has a one-legged race of humans with a single foot so huge it can be used as an umbrella, [[Homer]]'s stories of one-eyed giants, and so on.

[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writers explained parody as an imitation of one poet by another for humorous effect.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} In [[France|French]] [[Neoclassical literature]], ''parody'' was also a type of poem where one work imitates the style of another to produce a humorous effect. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] created [[satyr]] [[Play (theatre)|play]]s which parodied [[tragic play]]s, often with performers dressed like satyrs.

==Music==
{{Main|Parody music}}
In [[classical music]], as a technical term, ''parody'' refers to a reworking of one kind of composition into another (for example, a [[motet]] into a keyboard work as [[Girolamo Cavazzoni]], [[Antonio de Cabezón]], and [[Alonso Mudarra]] all did to [[Josquin des Prez]] [[motet]]s).&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Tilmouth, Michael and Richard Sherr. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/20937 "Parody (i)"]'  Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 19 February 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly, a [[parody mass]] (''missa parodia'') or an [[oratorio]] used extensive quotation from other vocal works such as motets or [[cantata]]s; [[Tomás Luis de Victoria|Victoria]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], [[Orlande de Lassus|Lassus]], and other composers of the 16th century used this technique. The term is also sometimes applied to procedures common in the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]], such as when [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] reworks music from [[Bach cantata|cantata]]s in his ''[[Christmas Oratorio]]''.

The musicological definition of the term ''parody'' has now generally been supplanted by a more general meaning of the word. In its more contemporary usage, [[parody music|musical parody]] usually has humorous, even satirical intent, in which familiar musical ideas or lyrics are lifted into a different, often incongruous, context.&lt;ref name=g2&gt;Burkholder, J. Peter. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52918pg8  "Borrowing"], Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 19 February. 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musical parodies may imitate or refer to the peculiar style of a composer or artist, or even a general style of music. For example, ''The Ritz Roll and Rock'', a song and dance number performed by [[Fred Astaire]] in the movie ''[[Silk Stockings]]'', parodies the [[Rock and Roll]] genre. Conversely, while the best-known work of [[Weird Al Yankovic]] is based on particular popular songs, it also often utilises wildly incongruous elements of [[popular culture|pop culture]] for comedic effect.

==English term==
[[File:Jan Brueghel the Younger, Satire on Tulip Mania, c. 1640.jpg|thumb|''{{Interlanguage link multi|Allegory of the Tulip omania|de|3=Allegorie der Tulipomanie}}'', persiflage on the [[tulip mania]], by [[Jan Brueghel the Younger]] (1640s]]

The first usage of the word ''parody'' in English cited in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is in [[Ben Jonson]], in ''Every Man in His Humour'' in 1598: "A Parodie, a parodie! to make it absurder than it was." The next citation comes from [[John Dryden]] in 1693, who also appended an explanation, suggesting that the word was in common use, meaning to make fun of or re-create what you are doing.

==Modernist and post-modernist parody==
In the 20th century, parody has been heightened as the central and most representative artistic device, the catalysing agent of artistic creation and innovation.&lt;ref name="Sheinberg 2000p141"&gt;Sheinberg (2000) pp.141, 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stavans1997p37"&gt;Stavans (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ro6a1EyaS2AC&amp;pg=PA37 p.37]&lt;/ref&gt; This most prominently happened in the second half of the century with [[postmodernism]], but earlier [[modernism]] and [[Russian formalism]] had anticipated this perspective.&lt;ref name="Sheinberg 2000p141"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, Malcolm [https://books.google.com/books?id=hUtOMoCNHyIC ''No, not Bloomsbury''] p.53, quoting [[Boris Eikhenbaum]]: {{quotation|Nearly all periods of artistic innovation have had a strong parodic impulse, advancing generic change. As the Russian formalist Boris Eichenbaum once put it: "In the evolution of each genre, there are times when its use for entirely serious or elevated objectives degenerates and produces a comic or parodic form....And thus is produced the regeneration of the genre: it finds new possibilities and new forms."}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Russian formalists, parody was a way of liberation from the background text that enables to produce new and autonomous artistic forms.&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p28"&gt;Hutcheon (1985) pp.28, 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Boris Eikhenbaum]] ''Theory of the "Formal Method"'' (1925) and ''O. Henry and the Theory of the Short Story'' (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s (1939) short story "[[Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote]]", is often regarded as predicting postmodernism and conceiving the ideal of the ultimate parody.&lt;ref name="Stavans1997p31"&gt;Stavans (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ro6a1EyaS2AC&amp;pg=PA31 p.31]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Bellalouna, Michael L. LaBlanc, Ira Mark Milne (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=CecJAQAAMAAJ ''Literature of Developing Nations for Students: L-Z''] p.50&lt;/ref&gt; In the broader sense of Greek ''parodia'', parody can occur when whole elements of one work are lifted out of their context and reused, not necessarily to be ridiculed.&lt;ref name="Elices2004p90"&gt;Elices (2004) p.90 quotation: {{quotation|From these words, it can be inferred that Genette's conceptualisation does not diverge from Hutcheon's, in the sense that he does not mention the component of ridicule that is suggested by the prefix ''paros''. Genette alludes to the re-interpretative capacity of parodists in order to confer an artistic autonomy to their works.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional definitions of parody usually only discuss parody in the stricter sense of something intended to ridicule the text it parodies. There is also a broader, extended sense of parody that may not include ridicule, and may be based on many other uses and intentions.&lt;ref name="Elices2004p90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p50"&gt;Hutcheon (1985) p.50&lt;/ref&gt; The broader sense of parody, parody done with intent other than ridicule, has become prevalent in the modern parody of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p50"/&gt; In the extended sense, the modern parody does not target the parodied text, but instead uses it as a weapon to target something else.&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p52"&gt;Hutcheon (1985) p.52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yunck 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the prevalence of the extended, recontextualizing type of parody in the 20th century is that artists have sought to connect with the past while registering differences brought by [[modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Hutcheon (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2012}} Major modernist examples of this recontextualizing parody include [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', which incorporates elements of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' in a 20th-century Irish context, and [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'',&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p52"/&gt; which incorporates and recontextualizes elements of a vast range of prior texts, including [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy|The Inferno]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The work of [[Andy Warhol]] is another prominent example of the modern "recontextualizing" parody.&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p52"/&gt; According to French literary theorist [[Gérard Genette]], the most rigorous and elegant form of parody is also the most economical, that is a ''minimal parody'', the one that literally reprises a known text and gives it a new meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gérard Genette]] (1982) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KbYzNp94C9oC&amp;pg=PA16 ''Palimpsests: literature in the second degree''] p.16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sangsue2006p72"&gt;Sangsue (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5MWFcIEE7EC&amp;pg=PA72 p.72] quotation: {{quotation|Genette individua la forma "piú rigorosa" di parodia nella "parodia minimale", consistente nella ripresa letterale di un testo conosciuto e nella sua applicazione a un nuovo contesto, come nella citazione deviata dal suo senso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blank parody, in which an artist takes the skeletal form of an art work and places it in a new context without ridiculing it, is common.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} [[Pastiche]] is a closely related [[genre]], and parody can also occur when characters or settings belonging to one work are used in a humorous or ironic way in another, such as the transformation of minor characters [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]] from [[Shakespeare]]'s drama [[Hamlet]] into the principal characters in a comedic perspective on the same events in the play (and film) ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Similarly, [[Mishu Hilmy]]'s ''Trapped in the Netflix'' uses parody to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] contemporary [[Netflix]] shows like [[Mad Men]] providing commentary through popular characters. Don Draper [[mansplaining]] about mansplaining, [[Luke Danes]] monologizing about a lack of independence while embracing [[codependency]].&lt;ref name="pink"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Willett|first1=Bec|title=Trapped in the Netflix at iO|url=http://perform.ink/review-trapped-netflix-io/|accessdate=23 March 2018|publisher=''[[Performink]]''|date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Flann O'Brien]]'s novel ''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'', for example, mad [[King Sweeney]], [[Fionn mac Cumhaill|Finn MacCool]], a [[pookah]], and an assortment of [[cowboy]]s all assemble in an inn in [[Dublin]]: the mixture of mythic characters, characters from [[genre]] fiction, and a quotidian setting combine for a humor that is not directed at any of the characters or their authors. This combination of established and identifiable characters in a new setting is not the same as the [[post-modernist]] trope of using historical characters in fiction out of context to provide a metaphoric element.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Reputation==
Sometimes the reputation of a parody outlasts the reputation of what is being parodied. For example, ''[[Don Quixote]]'', which mocks the traditional [[knight errant]] tales, is much better known than the novel that inspired it, ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'' (although Amadis is mentioned in the book). Another case is the [[novel]] ''[[Shamela]]''  by [[Henry Fielding]] (1742), which was a parody of the gloomy [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Pamela (novel)|Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740) by [[Samuel Richardson]]. Many of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s parodies of Victorian didactic verse for children, such as "[[You Are Old, Father William]]", are much better known than the (largely forgotten) originals. [[Stella Gibbons]]'s comic novel ''[[Cold Comfort Farm]]'' has eclipsed the pastoral novels of [[Mary Webb]] which largely inspired it.

In more recent times, the television sitcom ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]'' is perhaps better known than the drama ''[[Secret Army (TV series)|Secret Army]]'' which it parodies.

Some artists carve out careers by making parodies. One of the best-known examples is that of [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]. His career of parodying other musical acts and their songs has outlasted many of the artists or bands he has parodied.  Yankovic is not required under law to get permission to parody; as a personal rule, however, he does seek permission to parody a person's song before recording it. Several artists, such as rapper [[Chamillionaire]] and Seattle-based [[grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] stated that Yankovic's parodies of their respective songs were excellent, and many artists have considered being parodied by him to be a badge of honor.&lt;ref name="Ayers"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/07/24/weird-al-interview-mandatory-fun/|title=‘Weird Al’ Yankovic Explains His Secret Formula for Going Viral and Hitting No. 1|last=Ayers|first=Mike|date=24 July 2014|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamersly"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miami.com/quotweird-alquot-yankovic-brings-his-masterful-musical-parody-south-florida-article|title="Weird Al" Yankovic brings his masterful musical parody to South Florida|last=Hamersly|first=Michael|work=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US legal system the point that in most cases a parody of a work constitutes fair use was upheld in the case of [[Rick Dees]], who decided to use 29 seconds of the music from the song ''When Sonny Gets Blue'' to parody [[Johnny Mathis]]' singing style even after being refused permission. An appeals court upheld the trial court's decision that this type of parody represents fair use. ''[[Fisher v. Dees]]'' [[Court citation|794 F.2d 432]] (9th Cir. 1986)

==Film parodies==
{{Main article|Parody film}}
{{Original research|section|date=May 2009}}
Some [[Genre|genre theorists]], following [[Bakhtin]], see parody as a natural development in the life cycle of any [[genre]]; this idea has proven especially fruitful for genre film theorists. Such theorists note that [[Western movie]]s, for example, after the classic stage defined the conventions of the genre, underwent a parody stage, in which those same conventions were ridiculed and critiqued. Because audiences had seen these classic Westerns, they had expectations for any new Westerns, and when these expectations were inverted, the audience laughed.

Perhaps the earliest parody film was the 1922 ''[[Mud and Sand]]'', a [[Stan Laurel]] film that made fun of [[Rudolph Valentino]]'s film ''[[Blood and Sand (1922 film)|Blood and Sand]]''. Laurel specialized in parodies in the mid-1920s, writing and acting in a number of them. Some were send-ups of popular films, such as ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (disambiguation)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''&lt;!-- there are several such films so don't disambiguate this link --&gt;—parodied in the comic ''[[Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde]]'' (1926). Others were spoofs of Broadway plays, such as ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'' (1925), parodied as ''[[Yes, Yes, Nanette]]'' (1925). In 1940 [[Charlie Chaplin]] created a satirical comedy about [[Adolf Hitler]] with the film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'', following the first-ever Hollywood parody of the Nazis, the [[Three Stooges]]' short subject ''[[You Nazty Spy!]]''.

About 20 years later [[Mel Brooks]] started his career with a Hitler parody as well. After ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'' (1968), Brooks became one of the most famous film parodists and did spoofs on any kind of film genre. ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974) is a parody of western films, ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974) is a [[Frankenstein]] spoof, ''[[Spaceballs]]'' (1987) is a ''[[Star Wars]]'' spoof, and ''[[Robin Hood Men in Tights]]'' (1993) is Brooks' take on the classic Robin Hood tale.

The British comedy group [[Monty Python]] is also famous for its parodies, for example, the [[King Arthur]] spoof ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1974), and the [[Jesus]] satire ''[[Life of Brian]]'' (1979). In the 1980s the team of [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]], [[Jim Abrahams]] and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]] parodied well-established genres such as disaster, war and crime movies with the ''[[Airplane!]]'', ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' and ''[[The Naked Gun|Naked Gun]]'' series respectively. There is a 1989 film parody from Spain of the TV series ''[[The A-Team]]'' called ''El equipo Aahhgg'' directed by José Truchado.

More recently, parodies have taken on whole film genres at once. One of the first was ''[[Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood]]'' and the ''[[Scary Movie (series)|Scary Movie]]'' franchise. Other recent genre parodies include. ''[[Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday The 13th]]'', ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'', ''[[Date Movie]]'', ''[[Epic Movie]]'', ''[[Meet the Spartans]]'', ''[[Superhero Movie]]'', ''[[Disaster Movie]]'', ''[[Vampires Suck]]'', and ''[[The 41-Year-Old Virgin Who Knocked Up Sarah Marshall and Felt Superbad About It]]'', all of which have been critically panned.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Copyright===
Many parody films have as their target out-of-copyright or non-copyrighted subjects (such as ''Frankenstein'' or Robin Hood) whilst others settle for imitation which does not infringe copyright, but is clearly aimed at a popular (and usually lucrative) subject. The spy film craze of the 1960s, fuelled by the popularity of [[James Bond]] is such an example. In this genre a rare, and possibly unique, example of a parody film taking aim at a non-comedic subject over which it actually holds copyright is the 1967 James Bond spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967)|Casino Royale]]''. In this case, producer [[Charles K. Feldman]] initially intended to make a serious film, but decided that it would not be able to compete with the established series of Bond films. Hence, he decided to parody the series.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, A. &amp; Hearn, M. (1997) ''Kiss kiss bang bang: the unofficial James Bond film companion'', Batsford, p. 63 {{ISBN|9780713481822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetic parodies==
[[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]] considered poetic parody to take five main forms.&lt;ref&gt;K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) Introduction p. xx–xxii&lt;/ref&gt;
# The first was to use parody to attack the author parodied, as in [[J K Stephen]]'s mimicry of [[Wordsworth]], “Two voices are there: one is of the deep....And one is of an old half-witted sheep.”&lt;ref&gt;K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;
# The second was to pastiche the author's style, as with [[Henry Reed (poet)|Henry Reed]]'s parody of [[T. S. Eliot]], ''Chard Whitlow'': “As we get older we do not get any younger....”&lt;ref&gt;K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;
# The third type reversed (and so undercut) the sentiments of the poem parodied, as with [[Monty Python]]'s ''All Things Dull and Ugly''.
# A fourth approach was to use the target poem as a matrix for inserting unrelated (generally humorous) material&amp;nbsp;– “To have it out or not? That is the question....Thus dentists do make cowards of us all.”&lt;ref&gt;K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;
# Finally, parody may be used to attack contemporary/topical targets by utilizing the format of a well-known piece of verse: “O [[Salman Rushdie|Rushdie]], Rushdie, it's a vile world” ([[Cat Stevens]]).&lt;ref&gt;K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

A further, more constructive form of poetic parody is one that links the contemporary poet with past forms and past masters through affectionate parodying&amp;nbsp;– thus sharing poetic codes while avoiding some of the [[anxiety of influence]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Cushman ed., ''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' (Princeton 2012) p. 1003&lt;/ref&gt;

More aggressive in tone are playground poetry parodies, often attacking authority, values and culture itself in a carnivalesque rebellion:&lt;ref&gt;J. Thomas, ''Poetry's Playground'' (2007) p. 45-52&lt;/ref&gt; “Twinkle, Twinkle little star,/ Who the hell do you think you are?”&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in S. Burt ed., ''The Cambridge History of American Poetry'' (Cambridge 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-parody==
{{Main|Self-parody}}
A subset of parody is ''[[self-parody]]'' in which artists parody their own work (as in [[Ricky Gervais]]'s ''[[Extras (sitcom)|Extras]]'') or distinctions of their work (such as [[Antonio Banderas]]'s [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] in the ''[[Shrek]]'' [[sequel]]s) or an artist or genre repeats elements of earlier works to the point that originality is lost.

==Copyright issues==
{{see also|Plagiarism}}

Although a parody can be considered a [[derivative work]] of a pre-existing, copyrighted work, some countries have ruled that parodies can fall under [[copyright limitation]]s such as [[fair dealing]], or otherwise have fair dealing laws that include parody in their scope.

===United States===
Parodies are protected under the [[fair use]] doctrine of [[United States copyright law]], but the defense is more successful if the usage of an existing copyrighted work is transformative in nature, such as being a critique or commentary upon it.

In ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]  ruled that a rap parody of "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" by [[2 Live Crew]] was fair use, as the parody was a distinctive, transformative work designed to ridicule the original song, and that "even if 2 Live Crew's copying of the original's first line of lyrics and characteristic opening bass riff may be said to go to the original's 'heart,' that heart is what most readily conjures up the song for parody, and it is the heart at which parody takes aim."

In 2001, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals]], in ''[[Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin]]'', upheld the right of [[Alice Randall]] to publish a parody of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' called ''[[The Wind Done Gone]]'', which told the same story from the point of view of [[Scarlett O'Hara]]'s slaves, who were glad to be rid of her.

In 2007, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] denied a fair use defense in the ''Dr. Seuss Enterprises v. Penguin Books'' case. Citing the ''Campbell v. Acuff-Rose'' decision, they found that a [[satire]] of the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson murder trial]] and parody of ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]'' had infringed upon the children's book because it did not provide a commentary function upon that work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/9-c.html|title=Summaries of Fair Use Cases|author=Richard Stim|work=Stanford Copyright and Fair Use Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15758460119711775481&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr|title=Google Scholar|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{update|type=section|Changes from the Copyright Modernization Act, 2012|date=September 2012}}
Under [[Canadian law]], although there is protection for [[fair dealing#Canada|Fair Dealing]], there is no explicit protection for parody and satire. In ''[[Canwest v. Horizon]]'', the publisher of the [[Vancouver Sun]] launched a [[lawsuit]] against a group which had published a pro-[[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] parody of the paper. Alan Donaldson, the judge in the case, [[court ruling|ruled]] that parody is not a [[legal defence|defence]] to a [[Canadian copyright law|copyright]] claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/Mediacheck/2008/12/11/CanwestSuit/|title=The Tyee&amp;nbsp;– Canwest Suit May Test Limits of Free Speech|date=11 December 2008|work=The Tyee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In 2006 the ''[[Gowers Review of Intellectual Property]]'' recommended that the UK should "create an exception to copyright for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche by 2008."&lt;ref&gt;The Stationery Office. (2006) Gowers Review of Intellectual Property. [Online]. Available at [http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/other/0118404830/0118404830.pdf official-documents.gov.uk] (Accessed: 22 February 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Following the first stage of a two-part public consultation, the Intellectual Property Office reported that the information received "was not sufficient to persuade us that the advantages of a new parody exception were sufficient to override the disadvantages to the creators and owners of the underlying work. There is therefore no proposal to change the current approach to parody, caricature and pastiche in the UK."&lt;ref name="Gowers Second Stage Consultation"&gt;UK Intellectual Property Office. (2009) Taking Forward the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property: Second Stage Consultation on Copyright Exceptions. [Online]. Available at [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/consult-gowers2.pdf ipo.gov.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517005032/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/consult-gowers2.pdf |date=2011-05-17 }} (Accessed: 22 February 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, following the Hargreaves Review in May 2011 (which made similar proposals to the Gowers Review) the Government broadly accepted these proposals.  The current law (effective from 1 October 2014), namely Section 30A&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2356/regulation/5/made|title=The Copyright and Rights in Performances (Quotation and Parody) Regulations 2014|website=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]], now provides an exception to infringement where there is fair dealing of the original work for the purpose of parody (or alternatively for the purpose of caricature or pastiche).  The legislation does not define what is meant by "parody", but the UK IPO&amp;nbsp;– the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)]]&amp;nbsp;– suggests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/359250/Exceptions_to_copyright_-_Guidance_for_creators_and_copyright_owners.pdf|format=PDF|title=Exceptions to copyright : Guidance for creators and copyright owners|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a "parody" is something that imitates a work
for humorous or satirical effect.  See also [[Fair dealing in United Kingdom law]].

==Internet culture==
Parody is a prominent genre in online culture, thanks in part to the ease with which digital texts may be altered, appropriated, and shared. Japanese kuso and Chinese e'gao are emblematic of the importance of parody in online cultures in Asia. Video mash-ups and other parodic memes, such as humorously-altered Chinese characters, have been particularly popular as a tool for political protest in the People's Republic of China, the government of which maintains an extensive censorship apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Rea, "Spoofing (e’gao) Culture on the Chinese Internet.” In Humour in Chinese Life and Culture: Resistance and Control in Modern Times. Jessica Milner Davis and Jocelyn Chey, eds. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2013, pp. 149–172&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese internet slang makes extensive use of puns and parodies on how Chinese characters are pronounced or written, as illustrated in the [https://chinadigitaltimes.net/space/Grass-Mud_Horse_Lexicon:_Browse_by_Topic Grass-Mud Horse Lexicon].

==Social and political uses==
[[File:I did not raise my girl to be a voter3.jpg|right|thumb|Satirical political cartoon that appeared in ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' magazine, October 9, 1915. Caption "I did not raise my girl to be a voter" parodies the anti-[[World War I]] song "[[I Didn't Raise My Boy To Be A Soldier]]." A chorus of disreputable men support a lone anti-suffrage woman.]]
[[File:Reggie Brown by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reggie Brown (impersonator)|Reggie Brown]], a voice actor and [[Barack Obama]] impersonator]]

Parody is a frequent ingredient in [[satire]] and is often used to make social and political points. Examples include [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]'s "[[A Modest Proposal]]", which satirized English neglect of Ireland by parodying emotionally disengaged political tracts; and, recently, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', which parody a news broadcast and a talk show to satirize political and social trends and events.

On the other hand, the writer and frequent parodist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] made a distinction: "Satire is a lesson, parody is a game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Appel | first1 = Alfred, Jr. | authorlink1 = Alfred Appel | last2 = Nabokov  | first2 = Vladimir | authorlink2 = Vladimir Nabokov | year = 1967 | title = An Interview with Vladimir Nabokov | journal = Wisconsin Studies in Contemporary Literature | volume = VIII | issue = 2 | pages = 127–152 | url = http://lib.ru/NABOKOW/Inter06.txt_with-big-pictures.html | accessdate = 28 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some events, such as a national tragedy, can be difficult to handle. Chet Clem, Editorial Manager of the news parody publication ''[[The Onion]]'', told ''[[Wikinews]]'' in an interview the questions that are raised when addressing difficult topics:
{{cquote|I know the [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] issue was an obviously very large challenge to approach.  Do we even put out an issue?  What is funny at this time in American history?  Where are the jokes?  Do people want jokes right now?  Is the nation ready to laugh again?  Who knows.  There will always be some level of division in the back room.  It’s also what keeps us on our toes.&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[n:The Onion: An interview with 'America's Finest News Source'|An interview with The Onion]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', November 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Parody is by no means necessarily satirical, and may sometimes be done with respect and appreciation of the subject involved, without being a heedless sarcastic attack.

Parody has also been used to facilitate dialogue between cultures or subcultures. Sociolinguist [[Mary Louise Pratt]] identifies parody as one of the "arts of the contact zone", through which marginalized or oppressed groups "selectively appropriate", or imitate and take over, aspects of more empowered cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare often uses a series of parodies to convey his meaning. In the social context of his era, an example can be seen in ''[[King Lear]]'' where the [[Jester|fool]] is introduced with his [[Comb (anatomy)#Other|coxcomb]] to be a parody of the king.

[[Image:Funkhaus Nalepastraße Spree 2.jpg|right|thumb|Funkhaus Nalepastraße in East Berlin (2005)]]
'''Rundfunk der DDR''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁʊntfʊŋk dɛɐ̯ deːdeˈʔɛɐ̯|lang}}, ''Radio of the GDR'') was the [[radio]] broadcasting organisation for the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) from 1952 until [[German reunification]], after which it continued until 1991 as '''Funkhaus Berlin''' (''Broadcasting Center Berlin''). The organization was based in the ''Funkhaus Nalepastraße'' in [[East Berlin]].

==History==
===Post-war===
The pre-war [[Deutschlandsender]] stations, under the control of [[Joseph Goebbels]]' [[Propagandaministerium|Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda]] as the ''Großdeutsche Rundfunk'', were closed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] upon Germany's surrender in May 1945.  On 13 May 1945, the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]] (SMAG) began a radio broadcasting service to the people of Berlin called [[Berliner Rundfunk]], operating from what would become the British sector of [[West Berlin]].  The station was controlled by [[Walter Ulbricht]].

When the three Western occupation sectors in Berlin were established, the American zone gained the station [[Rundfunk im amerikanischen Sektor]] (RIAS), while the British zone established the [[Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk]] (NWDR) which also broadcast in their zone. In 1948, control of the NWDR was transferred to the provisional government in [[West Germany]] (later becoming [[Sender Freies Berlin]]), while RIAS remained under direct American control.

On 15 September 1952, the SMAG formally transferred control of broadcasting in the GDR to the [[Ministerrat|East German government]].

===The Berlin Wall===
[[Image:Hours of Output Rundfunk der DDR.svg|thumb|200px|right|The increase in hours of output from ''Rundfunk der DDR'' between 1965-1989]]

After the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in August 1961, the GDR began a programme to attempt to prevent its citizens from listening to broadcasts from RIAS and [[Sender Freies Berlin]] (SFB), the local outlet of the West German broadcasting consortium [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]. The ''Freie Deutsche Jugend'' ([[Free German Youth]]), the official youth movement in the GDR, started the campaign ''"Blitz contra Natosender"'' - "Lightning against NATO's transmitters" - to encourage young people to remove or turn away [[Antenna (radio)|aerials]] [[Ochsenkopf TV Tower|pointing at the west]]. The term ''Republikflüchtigen'' (Defection by Television) was sometimes used to describe the widespread practice of viewing ''Westfernsehen'' (Western TV).

The GDR also instituted a programme of [[Radio jamming|jamming]] foreign signals, both [[shortwave]] broadcasts from international broadcasters such as the [[BBC]] and local broadcasts such as RIAS. A network of jamming stations was built covering the entire country. However, attempts to jam broadcasts from West Berlin were soon abandoned as it was found to be impossible to do so effectively without also disrupting reception within West Germany - which was outlawed by treaty - and also ran the risk of counter-jamming of East German stations.

Nevertheless, people continued (or attempted) to listen to RIAS and SFB/ARD broadcasts. In 1981, a further attempt was made to draw GDR radio listeners - especially the young - from western broadcasts by launching a youth radio station, [[DT64]]. By 1985 there were 6,646,500 licensed radios in the country, or 39.9 for every 100 persons.

===After the Fall of the Wall===
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, the radio organisation of the GDR began to shut down as services from West Germany were introduced and the GDR's stations were renamed and refocused in anticipation of the country joining the existing ARD system on 1 January 1992.

Upon reunification in October 1990, two new public broadcasters ([[Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg]] in the east and [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk]] in the south) were created, and two existing West German public broadcasters expanded their coverage areas ([[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] from the north of the Federal Republic to the north of the whole country, and [[Sender Freies Berlin]] from West Berlin to the entire city).

In 1994, RIAS merged with the GDR's [[Deutschlandsender Kultur]] to become DeutschlandRadio Berlin, which later became [[Deutschlandradio Kultur]].

'''Shockwave''' is the name of several fictional characters in the [[Transformers]] robot superhero franchise. Throughout his incarnations, he is usually distinguished by a [[raygun|laser cannon]] instead of one of his hands and his distinctive face, which is featureless save for a single robotic eye. He is also commonly portrayed as a cold, emotionless Decepticon that serves as [[Megatron]]'s "mad scientist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Unofficial Guide to Transformers 1980s Through 1990s Revised &amp; Expanded 2nd Edition | last=Alvarez | first=J.E. | year=2001 | publisher=Schiffer Publishing Ltd.| ISBN=0-7643-1364-9 | page= 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to issues with [[Hasbro]]'s [[trademark]] of the name Shockwave, some products were also released under the name '''Shockblast''' or "Shockblast the Great".

As the Decepticons' military operations commander, Shockwave's power is second only to [[Megatron]], and even that is disputed. His actions are carried out with the cold, brutal clarity and perfection one would expect of a purely mechanical being—his way is not that of blood lust, like so many other Decepticons, but rather that of a scientist attempting to solve a problem. And that problem is: how can he use his abilities to most effectively eliminate the greatest number of enemies? Unfortunately for the Autobots, it is rare that Shockwave does not find an answer.

Unlike most early Transformers Shockwave was not modified into an Earthly form, and retains his [[Cybertron]] alternate mode—a 35-foot-long ray gun. He possesses the power of flight in both modes, and commands the totality of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] allowing him to emit beams of energy in a wide variety of forms. His high energy output makes him particularly fuel inefficient, but radioactive fuel sources stored in the reactor in his chest can help Shockwave to overcome this problem. Although his logical brain center is usually an advantage, human adversaries often pose more of a difficulty to Shockwave, as more intuitive and emotional thought processes often confound him.

While the animated series established Shockwave as fanatically loyal to Megatron, Shockwave's original bio and most fiction since have described him as coldly and patiently looking for ways to overthrow Megatron, not for personal power (as [[Starscream]] would) but simply because it was logical for him to do so. Shockwave, who is possibly even more powerful than Megatron, concluded that he should rule so that no emotion should prevent the Decepticons from conquering the universe. This was retained in most comic books, where Shockwave became leader of the Decepticons.

Unusually for a 1985 (second year) toy, Shockwave was part of Transformers fiction from the first year, appearing in both the original cartoon [[Television pilot|pilot]] and 4-issue comic book miniseries.

===Development===
According to writer [[Bob Budiansky]], the character of Shockwave was inspired by [[Spock]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Author |url=http://rustingcarcass.yuku.com/topic/954/t/Bob-Budiansky.html |title=Bob Budiansky - Interrogative - COMMUNITY FEATURES - THE RUSTING CARCASS ALCOHOL ABUSE CENTER - Message Board Yuku |publisher=Rustingcarcass.yuku.com |date=1958-09-28 |accessdate=2010-04-27 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
Shockwave was voted the 2nd top Transformer who was "badass" in the comics by Topless Robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2009/04/10_transformers_that_were_only_badass_in_the_comic.php |title=10 Transformers That Were Only Badass in the Comics By Rob Bricken, Apr. 14 2009 By Kevin J.

===Marvel Comics===
[[Image:Shockwave comic.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Shockwave's Marvel Comics appearance]]Shockwave's characterization in the animated series is based on an early profile written for the character which presented him to be the guardian of Cybertron, with no desires beyond that station. His toy's tech spec and ''Transformers Universe'' profile, however, wrote of a character who sought to overthrow Megatron and rule the Decepticons because he views it as the logical thing to do. This was the version of the character who impressed fans with his appearance in [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] ''Transformers'' comic book series. Also, unlike his cartoon incarnation, in which he was depicted as an easily beatable foe, his comic incarnation was very powerful.

Here, Shockwave was part of the Decepticon unit that pursued the Ark, but he held back from actually attacking the craft, remaining on the Decepticons' own space cruiser and following the Ark down to [[prehistoric Earth]] when it crashed. His guiding systems disrupted by his travel through Earth's atmosphere, Shockwave touched down in [[Antarctica]], specifically, in the [[Savage Land]], whose dinosaur inhabitants the Ark used as a basis to reconstruct five Autobots to battle Shockwave. These "[[Dinobot]]s" engaged Shockwave, but he slyly outmaneuvered them, and managed to trap them in a [[tar pit]] one by one by picking them off from a safe distance with his superior firepower. A stalemate was reached when the last strike by the Dinobots before sinking into the pit saw them bury Shockwave under a landslide, where he remained for four million years.

In 1984, Shockwave was reawakened by an Autobot probe dispatched from the Ark. He quickly struck the weakened Autobots, who had just defeated Megatron's forces. Deactivating them all and stringing them up in the Ark, which he took for his own base, Shockwave brought the Decepticons back online to serve him, and was soon challenged for leadership by a wounded Megatron, whom he soundly defeated and brought under his heel. As Decepticon commander, Shockwave commandeered the Blackrock Aerospace Plant, using its resources to construct new Transformers, which he then gave life using the [[Autobot Matrix of Leadership|Creation Matrix]], siphoned from [[Optimus Prime]]. However, Prime was able to transfer the Matrix into [[Witwicky family#Buster Witwicky|Buster Witwicky]]'s mind, preventing Shockwave from giving life to his newest creation, [[Jetfire]]. Shockwave instead programmed Jetfire to acquire Buster, but Buster was able to reprogram and give life to Jetfire and took Shockwave out of the game long enough to recover Optimus Prime's severed head. Prime then battled Shockwave and hurled him into a swamp.

Shockwave was able to extricate himself in short order, and attempted a series of failed plans, such as draining sonic energy from a rock concert and attempting to control [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]]. When Megatron resurfaced, he and Shockwave clashed again, but settled into a brief period of shared leadership until Shockwave fell victim to an Autobot trap, and saw the logic in Megatron's accusations of failure, ceding command to him. However, in the UK comic Shockwave did not stand for this for long, and he soon sent the [[Predacons]] in to assassinate both Optimus and Megatron, failing after Megatron teleported himself and Prime to Cybertron and only just managing to cover his tracks without Megatron knowing it was him. When Megatron began to descend into paranoid insanity after the death of Optimus Prime, Shockwave attempted to take advantage of the situation by arranging a staged attack by the Predacons (in the U.K. comic, the dialogue was rewritten to say that due to his insanity, Megatron had forgotten his original battle with them). Megatron defeated them even in their combined mode of Predaking, but when Shockwave revealed that he had duplicated his mind to disc to guide the Predacons during their hunt, Megatron's deranged mind (accurately) began to believe that this was how Optimus Prime had survived. Desperate and insane, Megatron apparently killed himself by blowing up the spacebridge while he was on it, once again allowing Shockwave to take leadership. However, he soon faced various objections courtesy of [[Ratbat]], the local Decepticon commander on Cybertron, who criticized his operations for being too fuel-inefficient. Arriving on Earth to oversee Shockwave's work, Ratbat encountered Buster Witwicky, whom he captured and brought to the Decepticons' mobile island base. With the Autobot [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmasters]] in pursuit, Shockwave transformed the island into its rocket mode and blasted off, but in a space-bound battle with [[Fortress Maximus]], Shockwave was defeated and sent hurtling into Earth's atmosphere, where he seemingly burned up.

Although this would be all that the U.S. comics would see of Shockwave for some time, this was not the case for its sister title, the U.K.-based ''Transformers'' comic, which reprinted the American stories with their own original material intertwined. In previous UK stories, Shockwave had run afoul of the future Decepticon leader, [[Galvatron]], who was attempting to disrupt his leadership in the present to ensure the loyalty of his army in the future. After his battle with Fortress Maximus, Shockwave was revealed to have survived his fall back to Earth and returned to the Decepticons' original castle base, where he had the [[Seacons]] acquire the body of what was apparently Megatron (but would, in actuality, be later revealed as a clone), which he brainwashed into doing his bidding in order to pit him against Galvatron. When he was visited by the other future Decepticons, [[Cyclonus]] and [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]] and learned that in their future, they would kill him, he unleashed Megatron upon them, who killed Cyclonus. Shockwave then turned Megatron upon Galvatron, but rather than destroy him, he saw a potential partner in Galvatron, and they teamed up to battle Autobots and Decepticons from both the present and future in the "Time Wars", as a rift in the space-time continuum bore down on them. Shockwave, however, had become a prisoner of his own logic - to seal the rift it was necessary to return Cyclonus's body to it, thereby saving everyone, including himself. A logical action. However, to do so would be to condemn himself to death in the future by Cyclonus and Scourge's hands. Illogical. Unable to cope with the paradox, Shockwave went insane, but was saved by [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]], who pointed out that, equipped with knowledge of his death, he could prevent it. His mind restored, Shockwave returned Cyclonus's body to the rift, after Galvatron and Scourge were consumed by it, and sealed it shut with an [[X-ray]] blast. The day had been saved, but Optimus Prime promised him that the next time they met, it would be as enemies.

A short time later, Shockwave went on to make his return to the pages of the U.S. comic, as he established a small splinter cell of Decepticons, consisting of himself, [[Starscream]], [[Mindwipe (Transformers)|Mindwipe]], [[Triggerhappy (Transformers)|Triggerhappy]], Ravage, [[Runabout (Transformers)|Runabout]] and [[Runamuck (Transformers)|Runamuck]]. Declaring civil war against the current Decepticon Earth commander, [[Scorponok]], Shockwave battled him in [[New Jersey]], only for the conflict to be interrupted when all the Transformers were transported back to Cybertron by their deity, [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]] to battle [[Unicron]]. Awestruck by the chaos-bringer, even Shockwave's vast data-grid could not compute a logical course of action, and he and Starscream hijacked the Ark and fled the planet shortly after Unicron's defeat. However, the Dinobots had previously treated the Transformers stored in the Ark's stasis pods with the life-restoring fuel, [[Nucleon (Transformers)|Nucleon]] - and among those Transformers was the true Megatron, who battled with Galvatron, who had also stowed away on board the craft. Galvatron came to his senses in time, realizing that if Megatron was killed, he could cease to exist, and hid as Shockwave arrived to kill a weakened and disorientated Megatron. Galvatron intervened, but in an attempt to break the cycle of violence that seemingly bound him and Megatron, the Autobot [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] crashed the Ark into Earth. Shockwave was last seen in pain as Megatron and Galvatron advanced on him just before the ship crashed. His fate remains unknown. He did not appear again in either the remainder of the US ''Generation 1'' comics or the subsequent ''Generation 2'' comics.

In the ''Earthforce'' sequence of UK comic stories, both Shockwave and Megatron were running separate Decepticon cells on Earth, fighting both Autobot and each other. (It was never really explained where the Earthforce stories fit into continuity, though many believe it takes place vaguely between the original comics and the G2 run) It was clear that unless they were united, the Decepticons could not ever defeat the Autobots, and so [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] and Starscream organized a coup of both cells and reunified them as a single army. Shockwave and Megatron were forced to team up to retake control.

The second wave of Decepticon Headmasters would appear in the U.K. Marvel comic issue #234, "Prime's Rib!" This story is set in the near future, 1995, where [[Optimus Prime]], [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] and [[Rodimus|Hot Rod]] introduce the latest Autobot, [[Arcee]], to the human [[feminists]]. She was met with displeasure by the humans, being called a token female and disliked for her pink color. They were then attacked by Shockwave, [[Fangry]], [[Horri-Bull]] and [[Squeezeplay (Transformers)|Squeezeplay]], who thought the Autobot would be unveiling a new weapon. The Autobots fought off the Decepticons, who escaped, but nothing seemed to please the human feminists.

In the U.K. comic stories set after the Transformers movie, it is revealed Shockwave survived the attack from Unicron and took command of the Decepticons in 2006 and, as [[Rodimus Prime]] was focused on finding Galvatron, was able to conquer half of Cybertron from under the Autobots. Part of his rule involved keeping Cyclonus &amp; Scourge from ever being in a position to usurp him, even arranging for them to botch [[Death's Head]]'s hit on Prime so he would kill them - this failed when Unicron sent them, backed up by a mind-controlled Death's Head, to assassinate him and take control of the Decepticons. Death's Head eventually killed Shockwave after a grueling battle, promising to avenge him even as he blew him apart.

===Animated series===
Though a major character in the Marvel comics, Shockwave was a minor character in the cartoon, only making occasional appearances, and was unquestioningly loyal to Megatron. When Megatron prepared to lead his troops in pursuit of the Autobots on the [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]], Shockwave was instructed to stay behind and guard [[Cybertron]] in Megatron's absence. Swearing that Cybertron would remain as Megatron left it, Shockwave performed his duty to the letter for four million years, after Megatron and the other Transformers were entombed in stasis on Earth.

So accurately did Shockwave carry out his task, however, that no advances were achieved in the war, and the deadlock slowly caused what little supplies of energy the planet had to dwindle. In the Earth year 1984, Shockwave again attempted to make contact with the lost Megatron - only this time, he received a reply. The Transformers on Earth had been awakened, and immediately, Shockwave and Megatron co-created the [[Space Bridge]], an inter-galactic transport system, with which to send [[Energon cube]]s made from Earth's energy to the depleted planet. In the first tests of the spacebridge, Megatron was transported to Cybertron himself, but Shockwave soon returned him so that further transport runs could be conducted.

Spacebridge technology was taken to its ultimate extreme in "The Ultimate Doom" when Shockwave and Megatron co-ordinated the transportation of Cybertron itself into the Solar System via the use of a colossal spacebridge.

In "Countdown to Extinction", when Starscream arrives on Cybertron (together with Doctor [[Arkeville]]) and proclaims himself the new leader of the Decepticons instead of the "late" Megatron, Shockwave does not believe him and tries to call up Megatron again and again. Starscream forbids him to do this and even fires at his computer terminal, but then he becomes too busy with preparing to receive the energy of the Earth's annihilation. Meanwhile, Shockwave succeeds in getting through to Megatron at last and in warning him of the explosive device installed by Starscream in the Arkeville's laboratory, so that Megatron and [[Optimus Prime]] have time to prevent the explosion and to save the Earth.

Shockwave briefly came to Earth and joined Megatron's troops in episode #23 "The Autobot Run", but returned to Cybertron shortly thereafter (this was later confirmed an animation error.)

In 1985, Shockwave contended with the power of the [[Dinobot]]s when they splintered off from the Autobots and came to Cybertron in "Desertion of the Dinobots", episodes #37-38. With the aid of his guards, Shockwave was able to overpower them and put them to work in the Cybertronian pits, but failed to prevent the escape of [[Spike Witwicky]] and his friend Carly, when they pursued the Dinobots to the planet and were able to effect their release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anime.com/Transformers/ |title=Transformers Season Two Box Set, Part 1 by Brian Cirulnick, February 2003 |publisher=Anime.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119132401/http://anime.com/Transformers/ |archivedate=2010-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after in episode #53 "The Search for Alpha Trion", Shockwave discovered that a guerrilla team of [[List of female Transformers|Female Autobots]], believed to be  destroyed by a missile strike during the Ark's launch four million years ago, had been raiding his Energon stores for years, and successfully tracked them back to their hidden base, arranging the capture of [[Elita One]]. Optimus Prime and three of his warriors came to Cybertron to aid their female allies, and Elita One herself blasted Shockwave out of the battle. Subsequently, Shockwave located the key to [[Vector Sigma]] for Megatron so he could give personalities to the [[Stunticons]] (and in a cut scene, battled and seriously damaged [[Omega Supreme]]). Spying on the Autobots, he then discovered the key's hidden power to transform organics into technomatter, and later reported to Megatron when he saw the Autobots create the [[Aerialbots]].

In the beginning of "Starscream's Brigade", Megatron is talking about how great Shockwave is, and [[Starscream]] is annoyed with it. When it results in a clash, Starscream was exiled from the Decepticons and to the island of [[Guadalcanal]]. On the island, he then decides to build an army using the old [[World War II]] vehicles on the island and traveled to Cybertron by Spacebridge. Evading Shockwave, he broke into a Decepticon detention center and stole personality components of five renegade Decepticons. Although Shockwave is unaware that Starscream raided the detention center, he does notice the missing components and reports to Megatron, who at first thought that Optimus Prime was the thief. In the sequel episode, "The Revenge of Bruticus", the vengeful [[Combaticons]] invaded Cybertron. Shockwave attempted to fend them off, but was turned against his sentinel drones when [[Bruticus]] (the combined form of the Combaticons) seized him stunned in gun mode and opened fire on them with him, before launching him off into space, where he crashed into Starscream. Little did Shockwave know, Starscream stole the personality components of five renegade Decepticons and the Combaticons were created from them. He and Starscream returned to the planet, but were captured and imprisoned by the Combaticons. They both were discharged when Optimus Prime and Megatron's forces teamed up and arrived to stop Bruticus' rampage.

Over the next two decades, Megatron turned his attention away from Earth, and succeeded in fully conquering Cybertron. In 2005, the Decepticons launched an attack on [[Autobot City]]. Shockwave was seen at the battle and also Starscream's coronation later. These appear to be animation errors, as he was always at his post to guard Cybertron. When the planet came under attack by [[Unicron]], Shockwave attempted to mobilize the Decepticons against the threat. The script for ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' explicitly details Shockwave's death as Unicron crushes his command tower with him in it, rips it off the planet, and tears it to shreds, and although this was not shown in the finished film, Shockwave was not seen again following the movie (although several incorrectly colored versions of Shockwave—presumably intended to be generic Decepticons—were seen in some third-season episodes of the TV series, most notably ''Five Faces of Darkness'' Parts 1-5). The [[IDW Publishing]] adaptation of the movie has Shockwave lead the Decepticons against Unicron, only to be blown in half by the Chaos-Bringer's eye beams.

In Shockwave's first appearance, in "More Than Meets the Eye", Part One, he has two hands. By his next appearance, in the first episode of the ongoing series, "Transport to Oblivion", his left hand has been replaced with a gun barrel, matching his toy appearance (although notably the toy's box art itself incorrectly presented the gun barrel as being on his ''right'' arm). He later becomes the leader of the Decepticons and the last Transformer. He is killed by humans three times before he becomes Shockblast (2018 comics).

===Dreamwave Productions===
Shockwave was a major character in the [[Dreamwave Productions]]' 21st century re-imagining of G1. As a major player in the Decepticon army in Cybertron's past, he led the main attack on the Autobots' stronghold shortly after the appointment of [[Optimus Prime]], and personally destroyed two [[Omega Supreme|Omega Sentinels]] with one blast in space gun mode. There was also tension between him and [[Starscream]] about who would lead the Decepticons after Megatron's supposed death, which eventually led to the creation of multiple splinter factions within both the Autobots and Decepticons. While Starscream created his own faction, the "[[Predacons]]", Shockwave led the Decepticons through the "Dark Ages" of Cybertron, during which his logic allowed him to put aside differences with [[Jetfire]] and the Autobots in order to defeat the greater evil of The [[Fallen (Transformers)|Fallen]]. As the Dark Ages came to an end, Shockwave was ready to sign a peace treaty with [[Ratbat]]'s [[Ultracons]] and the Autobots, but the return of Megatron derailed the plan, though the [[Quintessons|Quintesson]]-created clones he brought back to the planet with him greatly intrigued Shockwave.

Shockwave was left behind on Cybertron while Megatron's forces pursued Optimus Prime and were subsequently lost on Earth for four million years, and became Decepticon leader on the planet. He began experimenting with cloning, and through studies of [[Astrotrain]] and [[Blitzwing]], began to conceive the idea of a Transformer with multiple alternate modes. Eventually, however, Shockwave and all the other Transformers on Cybertron succumbed to stasis lock as the planet's energy ran out, and it entered a hibernation phase known as the "Great Shutdown." During this period of inactivity, 3,000 years ago, [[Unicron]]'s [[Heralds of Unicron|herald]] [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]] located the planet, and reactivated Shockwave for study purposes. However, when Shockwave was attacked by a swarm of [[Sharkticons]], Scourge intervened, and after saving him, was shot by Shockwave, who then proceeded to study him, learning much of the function and purpose of Transformers and Cybertron from the secrets within Scourge.

Shockwave steadily worked to restore Cybertron, reactivating its population and solving their energy needs, ending the war and unifying the planet. He also continued his experiments into multiple transformations, yielding the unstable [[Duocons]], and then successfully mastering the process with [[Triple Changer]]s. Capturing [[Alpha Trion]], Shockwave sought to unlock the full secrets of [[Vector Sigma]], having already learned of the mysterious significance of Earth to the Transformer race. In preparation for the invasion of the planet, Shockwave subliminally influenced the population of Cybertron to become more violent, and prevented the return of Optimus Prime and Megatron aboard the Ark II by having a human agent blow it up.

In 2003, Shockwave made his move, heading to Earth with his Triple Changer troops and capturing Megatron and Optimus's forces, planning to try the two leaders as war criminals. Megatron was jettisoned into space by Starscream, while Prime's escape from his clutches led him to fall in with a rebel group, and then to confront Shockwave himself, only to be defeated by the Decepticon, who ripped the Matrix from him. Using the Matrix to activate Vector Sigma, Shockwave downloaded the compressed contents of the mega-computer into his network, but before he had an opportunity to view the data, he was pulled into a battle with [[Ultra Magnus]]. In the course of the fight, the fuel line to his cannon was severed, and the resulting explosion destroyed his citadel and knocked him into a chasm.

While the rest of Cybertron believed Shockwave to be deceased, he had actually survived the explosion and gone underground in the wastelands of Cybertron with Astrotrain, Blitzwing, and the Conehead seekers [[Dirge (Transformers)|Dirge]], [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]], and [[Thrust (Transformers)|Thrust]]. He continued his experimentation, resulting in [[Sixshot]]. Soon after, however, Megatron returned to Cybertron and bested Shockwave, taking him to Earth where he did the same to Starscream. But now, the three players were assembled, each knowing certain dark secrets of Cybertron's past. Unfortunately, Dreamwave's bankruptcy and subsequently closure at the start of 2005 means that currently, this story remains unresolved.

Shockwave also appeared in several other Dreamwave miniseries, including Transformers/G.I. Joe ( where he was given a [[World War II]] artillery cannon alternate mode) and the Micromasters series. In this series, set after The War Within but before the Great Shutdown, Shockwave is in command of the Cybertron Decepticons, with [[Scorponok]] and [[Ratbat]] serving under him. Later in the series a low-on-fuel Shockwave is defeated by the [[Micromasters|Micromaster]] Skystalker and decapitated. Whether this mini-series is in continuity with the main Generation One series is unclear.

===Devil's Due Publishing===
Shockwave was also in the second G.I. Joe vs the Transformers series from [[Devil's Due Publishing]]. In this Shockwave had taken control of the Decepticon army after [[Megatron]]'s disappearance and conquered Cybertron, forcing the Autobots underground. However, this all changed when [[Cobra Commander]] hacked into Teletraan III with the aim of creating a wormhole to Cybertron where he could steal more Transformer technology. G.I. Joe attempted to interfere and they, along with Cobra and Cobra Commander's personal transport [[Starscream]] were all transported to Cybertron. Shockwave arrived with his troops (including [[Cyclonus]], [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]], and the Conehead seekers) and attempted to eliminate them. However a squad of Autobots led by [[Ultra Magnus]] stop them, keeping the Decepticons out by erecting a shield generator. While the Joes and [[Cobra Command|Cobra]] forces attempted to locate several time-displaced Transformers (including [[Optimus Prime]]), Shockwave's forces battered at the shield and eventually overwhelmed it, capturing most of the humans and Teletran 3 and wounding [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] in the process. The humans were able to sneak in and undo the blocks on the time-displacement equipment, allowing the last Transformers to return - the [[Dinobot]]s, reconfigured into their now-familiar dinosaur modes. They wiped out most of Shockwave's forces and severely damaged Shockwave. As Starscream tried to weasel his way out of being killed by Shockwave for his part in the fiasco, both were instead eliminated when Cobra Commander activated his "parting gift" to the traitorous Starscream - 45 pounds of plastic explosives.

Despite the character being notoriously difficult to kill, it seems Shockwave did indeed perish in the explosion. In the third crossover a group of Autobots and G.I. Joes returning to Cybertron via the Spacebridge are attacked by Cannabilizers - old and damaged Transformers after spare parts. One of these clearly has Shockwave's gun arm.

===Fun Publications===
The ''[[Transformers Classics]]'' comics published in the Official Transformers Collectors Club magazine is set in the Marvel Comics continuity, but in a timeline where the events of ''Generation 2'' did not occur. Shockwave's severed but still living head appears among Megatron's troops.

Shockwave was among Megatron's troops when Megatron defeated Deathsaurus in combat for leadership of the Decepticons and when Megatron attacked Iacon with his new weapon, [[Devastator (Transformers)|Devastator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Pete Sinclair &amp; Jesse Wittenrich | title = Battle Lines Part 5 | journal = Transformers Collectors Club Magazine| volume = 1 | issue = 41 | page= 3 |date = October–November 2011|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IDW Publishing===
Since the Dreamwave bankruptcy, the Transformers license has been acquired by [[IDW Publishing]], who have begun to issue their own Transformers series. [[The Transformers: Evolutions|The Transformers: Evolutions: Hearts of Steel]], an alternate reality set during America's [[Industrial Revolution]], features Shockwave reconfigured as a Confederate-style [[Ironclad]]. He is the first Transformer to reveal himself to the humans, transforming from boat mode at the end of issue #1. Although he only briefly appeared after this in issue #2, showing Tobias Muldoon the Decepticon base, he was presumably destroyed when [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] and [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] managed to send the entire Decepticon rail convoy into a chasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brice |first=Jason |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/115705948969106.htm |title=Transformers: Evolution: Hearts of Steel #2 Review - Line of Fire Reviews |date=2006-08-31 |accessdate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the main IDW Transformers universe, Generation One Shockwave made his first appearance in the first issue of ''[[The Transformers: Spotlight]]''. In this single-issue story, Shockwave sees the coming state of Cybertron (which, as ''[[The Transformers: Stormbringer]]'' would show, would turn out to be accurate). Launching energon missiles into space, one crashes on Earth with Shockwave looking on this as an experiment in progress. However, he was interrupted by the [[Dinobots]], seeking revenge for a past defeat involving Shockwave stealing their energon cache. They adopted the forms of extinct dinosaurs to combat the high energon levels of the planet. Despite the ferocity of the Dynobots' assault he was still able to defeat them all. However, [[Grimlock]], anticipating possible defeat, programmed their ship to fire upon their location if they did not return, burying them all in lava, until a human archeology team discovered them many years later. In ''[[The Transformers: Escalation]]'' it was revealed the bodies of both Shockwave and the Dynobots had been uncovered by the mysterious defense organization Skywatch.

Shockwave's actions here serve as a prequel to other story lines: the rich energon seams Shockwave plants here are discovered by [[Starscream]]'s infiltration unit, leading to the events of ''Infiltration'', while Megatron, at the story's close, assigns [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]] to seal off Shockwave's research, implying that this is how he gains the knowledge he has in ''Stormbringer''.

It is hinted in the Spotlight that Shockwave at one point cut himself off from his emotions.

Shockwave is subsequently reactivated by Skywatch to locate and nullify Laserbeak, Ravage, and the Dinobots whom Skywatch have lost control of. Soundwaves help is obtained to break a code that Skywatch have planned to detonate a bomb in Shockwaves head if he does not do Skywatch's bidding. Upon locating the Dinobots Shockwave firstly engages and defeats Scorponok in battle, and then turns his attentions to Grimlock. However Soundwave correctly encrypts Skywatch's codes enabling Shockwave to disengage the Bomb, at this point Shockwave disengages the battle with Grimlock and walks away, only for Grimlock to detonate a bomb burying them both in rubble. Shockwave is subsequently captured and imprisoned by Ultra Magnus.

In the recent mini series Last Stand of the Wreckers it was revealed that when the sadisic renegade Decepticon known as Overlord took control of the Autobot pirson "The Last Resort" he freed Shockwave and gave him a hand picked crew of Decepticons in return for Shockwave disabling the safe guards he had implanted in him under Megatron's orders, just as he had done to Overlord's fellow Phase Six Decepticons Sixshot and Black Shadow.

Following his escape Shockwave joined up with the Decepticons currently faltering under Starscream's weak and ineffective leadership. He claims to be working on repairing the Space Bridge though Megatron, still on life support following his battle with Optimus Prime, suspects that he is not being completely truthful.

===Transformers: Alternators===
Shockwave staged a comeback in 2005's ''[[Transformers: Alternators]]'' toy line, which featured classic characters re-interpreted with modern vehicular alternate modes. Although the American toys offered no supporting fiction, the storyline included with the Japanese version of the line, '''''Binaltech''''', detailed the story of Shockwave's rebirth in this unusual new form.

When the time-displaced Decepticon agent, [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]], used the time machine called the Kronosphere to alter the time line (branching off the Binaltech/Alternators storyline from the continuity of the G1 animated series), the chaos that ensued resulted in the destruction of Shockwave's body. With Ravage's aid, his mind was installed into a stolen Autobot "Binaltech" body, equipped with a prototype "Transmuter" device, which, when interfaced with Shockwave's personality component, allowed the chassis to "transmute" itself into Shockwave's recognizable physical form, including his cyclopean visage and gun-arm. He wields a Turbo Rifle which can also serve as a power booster for his gun-arm, and can project up to five holographic duplicates of himself anywhere on the planet (an ability mentioned in the series bible for the original animated series, but never put to use until episode 4).

===Other media===
In the ''[[Megas XLR]]'' episode ''Ice Ice Megas'', the robots of the Cerilian Army resemble Shockwave in almost every way, except color and alt mode. All of them were voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]].

In an episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', Shockwave finds Soundwave in eBay and asks Megatron if he buys it now.

Shockwave also appears in the ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' episode "The Black Corsage".

===Toys===
* '''''Generation 1'' Shockwave''' (1985)
:The Shockwave toy transforms from a robot into a ray gun that can be wielded in a "role play" fashion, featuring electronic laser noises and lights. The toy itself was one of the first ''Transformers'' figures not derived from the Japanese [[Diaclone]] or [[Microman]] toy lines, instead coming from a company named ToyCo, which had produced the toy under the name "Astro Magnum". It is believed this was the only toy that ToyCo made. Unlike Shockwave, Astro Magnum was gray with a red eye, and a standard trigger design (changed to a flat trigger for Shockwave, perhaps due to the "phallic" position it adopted in robot mode). Also unusual is that, prior to Shockwave's release by [[Hasbro]], [[RadioShack|Radio Shack]] sold the gray version in the US (often referred to as "Shackwave" by fans). However, it is debated as to whether or not the Radio Shack release was a licensed ToyCo release or a bootleg. Notably, unlike other early Transformers figures not made by Takara such as Jetfire or Omega Supreme, Shockwave was the only non-Takara toy that was actually marketed and sold as part of the ''Transformers'' line in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfu.info/1985/Decepticon/Shockwave/shockwave.htm |title=Shockwave (1985) - Decepticon Military Operations Commander |publisher=www.tfu.info |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:In the 1980s, ''Transformers'' was such a success that Hasbro wanted to get as much product out on the shelves with the ''Transformers'' name on it as possible. Since they were running out of old Takara molds to use, they obtained licences to use the molds of other companies' robot toys in the ''Transformers'' line. Shockwave, Jetfire, Omega Supreme, Sky Lynx, Roadbuster, Whirl, Chop Shop, Venom, Barrage and Ransack were among those molds. It was believed with the licences to those toys now expired, Hasbro and Takara no longer had legal rights to those figures and could not reissue them. However, hope of a Shockwave reissue by Takara increased when Omega Supreme was announced as part of the Takara Encore line for release in May 2008 in Japan.
:This toy was used to represent Shockwave when he appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "Werewolf vs. Unicorn".

:In recent years bootleg versions of the Shockwave figure based on the original G1 toy mold have appeared in the Chinese market. However, this new toys are grey colored and lack the transparent chest plate piece, which is evident as the toy's chest kept the holes where the plate was attached. Also the head of the robot was changed to a more anthropomorphic version with red eyes and a mouth piece.
* '''''Generation 1'' Action Master Shockwave''' (1990)
:A second toy incarnation of Shockwave was sold in 1991, as part of the non-transforming "Action Masters" sub-line. He was accompanied by a transforming "terror droid" partner named Fistfight - a loathsome little creature who enjoys dissecting late-model cars - who transforms into a long-range lightning rifle that Shockwave can wield. Although many other Action Masters had appeared in the Marvel Comics continuity, Action Master Shockwave did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfu.info/1990/Decepticon/Shockwave/shockwave.htm |title=Shockwave (1990) - Decepticon Military Ops.

* '''''Alternators'' Shockblast''' (2005)
:Due to trademark problems with Shockwave's name (lost to toy company [[Lanard Toys]]), the new incarnation of Shockwave created for ''Alternators'' was released under the "Shockblast" moniker (although the toy itself paid homage to the original name by including a license plate that read "SHKWAV").

==Transformers: Armada==
{{main|Tidal Wave (Transformers)}}

"Shockwave" was the name Takara used for the character called [[Tidal Wave (Transformers)|Tidal Wave]] by Hasbro. Hasbro's original design for the figure cast him in shades of purple and gray, although they later abandoned this in favor of a green and gray scheme for their figure; the animated series, however, had gone into production before this last-minute change, resulting in the cartoon incarnation of the character being rendered in the purple and gray scheme. Accordingly, in the interest of show-accuracy, Takara release their figure in this color scheme, rather than the altered Hasbro one - happily, these colors fit suitably well with his Japanese name in hearkening back to the purple-and-gray G1 Shockwave, although it is unclear whether or not this was intentional, though unlikely since Shockwave was known as Laserwave in the Japanese dub of the G1 cartoon.

Although the assorted ''Transformers'' series which followed the original often paid homage to many popular characters by naming new characters after them, or sculpting them to share their likeness, Shockwave was without a homage in the US for over a decade—it would not be until the midst of 2004's ''Transformers: Energon'' line that Shockwave received this honor in the form of '''Shockblast'''. Hasbro had since lost the trademark to the name "Shockwave" to Lanard Toys (as noted above), and compensated as best they could through use of this altered name. As previously noted, in Japan, Takara still retained the rights to their original name, hence there, Shockblast was still named Laserwave.

Hugely egotistical, cold, ruthless, and a genius, Shockblast is sometimes loyal to Megatron but occasionally acts like Starscream and seeks to overthrow his master. Shockblast's capacity for ruthlessness exceeds even that of Megatron which makes his personality a cross between his leaders and Starscream's. However, despite that, Starscream himself even under Megatron's control seems to respect Shockblast. The power-hungry Shockblast transforms into an orbital Satellite and a ground-based assault vehicle (although in the animated series, he only transformed into the former). He has an unspecified history with [[Tidal Wave (Transformers)|Tidal Wave]], who distrusts him (the Japanese dub of the series indicated that this was because Shockblast was part of Tidal Wave's platoon, and turned on his fellow Decepticons after the Autobots were defeated).

===Animated series===
Considered to be one of the most dangerous and deadly Decepticons, Shockblast was captured by the Autobots and imprisoned on Cybertron. In the Earth year 2020, when [[Megatron]] attacked Cybertron with Unicron, he instructed some Decepticon agents on the planet to liberate Shockblast. Shockblast, however, had already begun to effect his own escape amidst the chaos Megatron's attack was causing, and broke free of his restraints just as a Decepticon agent arrived at his cell, and was killed by Shockblast simply because he had no need of him. In making his escape, Shockblast killed one of his guards, Padlock, causing his other jailer, Wing Dagger, to swear revenge.

Shockblast immediately rankled under Megatron's leadership, and was attacked by Wing Dagger when he led a new attack on Cybertron. Tidal Wave was ordered to aid him, but Shockblast had already collapsed an Energon Tower and dragged Wing Dagger under it, killing him, and accidentally injuring Tidal Wave. Both victims were soon reborn, however - Tidal Wave as [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]], and Wing Dagger as the powerful [[Wing Saber]]. While Wing Saber merged with [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]] as the Autobots ventured into Unicron, Shockblast defied Megatron's orders, lying and claiming he was under attack while sneaking off and preparing to make a power play. When Megatron faced off against Optimus Prime in the middle of an Energon reaction that had torn a fissure in space, Shockblast leaped into the middle, only to be hit by a chunk of debris and sent spiraling through the fissure, into a new region of space where [[Alpha Q]] had recreated the planets destroyed by Unicron.

Separated from the other Decepticons, Shockblast was confronted by the Autobots on Iron Planet and was defeated and captured by Wing Saber, and chained and guarded by [[Inferno (Transformers)|Inferno]]. Megatron and the other Decepticons soon arrived to rescue him and Megatron warned him of the price of defiance. This did not stop Shockblast from attempting to seize power again, however - and in his next move, he succeeded, seating himself in Megatron's throne within Unicron, planning to take the chaos-bringer's power for his own. However, he got more power than he bargained for, as Unicron's essence possessed him, warping his body and driving him into an insane rage. Battling with Optimus Prime on Blizzard Planet, Shockblast was destroyed when Unicron's massive arm plunged down through the planet's atmosphere and crushed him, completely extinguishing his Spark.

Shockblast's place in the Decepticons was soon filled by his own younger and equally treacherous brother, [[Sixshot|Six Shot]].

===Pack-in mini-comics===
Shockblast would make his only comics appearance in the third promotional mini-comic packaged with ''Transformers: Energon'' toys. When [[Slugslinger]] and Sharkticon attempted to break into an Autobot island facility as Shockblast scrambled the security system with an electromagnetic pulse from orbit, they were caught and battled with Bulkhead and Towline who had some unexpected help—[[Omega Supreme]], who soundly defeated all the Decepticons present.

The name of Shockwave would make an unexpected reappearance in the fourth mini-comic, as one of Megatron's troops. On Earth Megatron, with the aid of [[Cyclonus|Snowcat]], Shockwave, [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]] and [[Demolisher]], cornered Optimus Prime and a wounded [[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]]. Optimus nobly refused to give up. The other Autobot reinforcements were over ten minutes away and the two Autobots looked done for when [[Wing Saber]] arrived. Making a powerlinx link with Optimus Prime, Prime soundly defeated all the Decepticons, even Megatron, and forced them to flee. The Autobots then arrived and Optimus thanked Wing Saber for his help.

===Toys===
* '''Energon Shockblast''' (2004)
:Designed mainly to be a visual homage to the original Shockwave, the Shockblast figure is designed for its robot mode – it features Shockwave's traditional one-eyed head, and a large gun-barrel arm. Consequently, however, its two vehicle modes are something of an ad-hoc jumble of parts. By sliding forward the level on his gun-arm in any mode, the panels on the gun fan out, exposing gold-chromed solar-panel-like decals beneath, and the arm launches a missile with an electronic blasting sound effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfu.info/2004/Decepticon/Shockblast/shockblast.htm |title=Shockblast (2004) - Decepticon |publisher=www.tfu.info |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toyfare magazine issue #80, April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shockwave name returned to the ''Transformers'' toy line in the US as part of the ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'' series in 2005. Packaged with [[Tankor]], a Mini-Con Autobot, Shockwave himself is of Decepticon allegiance and a member of the Sky Attack Team. Left free to pursue his own interests on Earth following the departure of the two other Transformer factions, Shockwave has spent the last decade working for various dictators and tyrants around the world. Who he signs up with is based on how likely he is to be able to cause devastation and death - because there's nothing he loves more than seeing a city go up in flames, and knowing he lit the fire.

According to an interview with producer [[Tom DeSanto]] published in issue #15 of the ''Transformers Collectors Club Magazine'', the original lineup pitched for the Decepticons in the [[Transformers (film)|live action Transformers film]] consisted of [[Megatron (Transformers)#Role in the films|Megatron]], [[Starscream]], [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]], [[Laserbeak]], [[Rumble (Transformers)|Rumble]], [[Skywarp]], and Shockwave. However, Shockwave was left out of the original film as the lineup eventually ended up as Megatron, Starscream, [[Scorponok]], [[Frenzy (Transformers)|Frenzy]], [[Barricade (Transformers)|Barricade]], [[Bonecrusher (Transformers)|Bonecrusher]], [[Blackout (Transformers)|Blackout]] (who replaced Soundwave), and [[Brawl (Transformers)|Brawl]] (misnamed [[Devastator (Transformers)|Devastator]]).

He does appear in the third film, ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]''. Actor [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] was originally being considered for the role, but the part was ultimately given to [[Frank Welker]], who also voices [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] after Corey Burton declined to return to the role. This marked the second time that Shockwave was voiced by an actor who also voiced [[Megatron]], [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] and [[Batman]], that [[Corey Burton]] had previously voiced all three. Bay commented before the movie's release that Shockwave was going to be portrayed as a "little bit more vicious" than Megatron. He was considered to be a main villain but he ended up being as supporting villain in film. Shockwave is armed with a hand cannon, a multiple rocket launcher and a blade, and during the film he commands '''Driller''', a massive and powerful Cybertonian animal.

Shockwave's design in the film retains most of his original features from the Generation 1 incarnation, most noticeably in his head design, hand cannon, and color scheme.

===IDW Publishing===
Longarm and Salvage are rescuing human workers at an oil plant disaster in Dalian, China when the Decepticons Shockwave and [[Astrotrain]] crash to Earth and kill them. Shockwave leaves Astrotrain and observes a group of Decepticons working for Starscream as they confront the Autobots. He traces the radioactive trail left by Starscream's minion Divebomb back to Starscream's base in junkyard of the outskirts of [[Mexico City]]. After blasting his way past [[Ruination (Transformers)|Ruination]] and Deadlift, Shockwave tells Starscream that Megatron requires his services. Shockwave then sends Starscream to recover the drone called [[Brains (Transformers)|Brains]]. Shockwave, meanwhile, carves a path of destruction through the Autobot's base, slaughtering both Autobots and humans. Eventually he comes into conflict with Optimus Prime, who brutally beats him, angered by the death of his friends including Elita One. Shockwave is only saved by the arrival of his pet Driller.

He is responsible for the [[Tunguska event]].

===Video games===
Shockwave does appear, however, in the tie-in ''[[Transformers: The Game]]''. He is a [[Triple Changer]] with a robot, gun turret, and [[AH-64 Apache]] helicopter modes and is a [[boss (video game)|boss]] for the Autobots later in the game, where he must fight [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)|Optimus Prime]]. In the game, Shockwave delays Optimus Prime from rescuing Bumblebee when Bumblebee is captured by Sector 7. Physically, he is taller than Optimus Prime. Shockwave, however, appears to submit to Starscream, instead of the other way around like his G1 incarnation. He also appears in the Autobot Cybertron mission in the console versions of the game.

In the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version of the game, he is a playable character. He first appears with partner [[Thundercracker]] while trying to protect [[Blackout (Transformers)|Blackout]] and [[Scorponok]] in Qatar. He next appears in the Arctic dig site, where he, Thundercracker and fellow Decepticon [[Dreadwing]], try to find Megatron. They first destroy the Autobot transmitter satellites, then go inside the site. They are also attacked by several drones. They do not find Megatron and realize there is a satellite about to launch. The Autobot drones decide to blow up the place, but Thundercracker and Shockwave make it out, leaving Dreadwing to perish in the explosion. Then they go to the launch site, attempting to transmit a signal in the satellite for Decepticon drones to approach them. Shockwave distracts the armed forces while Thundercracker places the signal. They succeed, and Shockwave is rescued by Thundercracker. Shockwave meets with Blackout and Scorponok, but does not find their army and they have not heard from Thundercracker (Unknown to them, Autobot [[Ironhide]] already killed Thundercracker and Autobots [[Hound (Transformers)|Hound]] and [[Trailbreaker]] disrupted the signal). At the end of the game, after the Autobots succeed in destroying most of the Decepticons and bringing peace to Earth, Shockwave and Starscream retreat to Cybertron. Starscream and Shockwave argue about leadership now that Megatron is dead. They decide to go to war, with players assuming the role of Starscream. Starscream successfully destroys Shockwave and his followers.

In the [[Nintendo DS]] versions of the game (both Autobots and Decepticons) features all chopper vehicle modes that transform into a robot complete with Shockwave's head.

Shockwave appears as the final boss in the ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon (video game)|Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'' console game, set before the events of the film. Megatron sets out to free him from captivity in a Russian facility, destroying the cryo tanks keeping him frozen. Shockwave began to thaw as Optimus found him, and the driller attacked until Shockwave was active. However he was still sluggish, and this proved to be an advantage to Optimus, who attacked the power coils on his back powering his cannon, forcing Shockwave to take cover in the driller. After Optimus drove off the Driller again, Shockwave began fighting Optimus and several Autobot soldiers, taking the smaller robots with ease until Optimus used his flight-pack mode to finish the one-eyed Decepticon. Luckily for Shockwave, the driller returned and whisked him away. Arriving in Africa where Megatron, Starscream, and Soundwave were waiting. Megatron welcomed back his best assassin, and ordered him to head to Chernobyl as part of Operation: Pillar.

===Movie plot===
[[File:DOTM-Shockwave.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Shockwave and his Driller appear in ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]''.]]
Shockwave first appeared during [[Optimus Prime]]'s mission to [[Chernobyl]] with NEST troops. They had discovered a fuel cell from the ''Ark'' in an abandoned base. At that moment, Shockwave and his Driller - a massive multi-tentacled robotic animal - appear and immediately begin destroying the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] and killing some of the soldiers in the process. They then proceed to take the fuel cell and burst out of the base with Optimus Prime following. The fight then takes to the land where the Driller knocks Optimus from his trailer, separating him from his weapons. However, Prime was still able to gain access to them and cut off one of the driller's tentacles to retrieve the fuel cell. At this moment Shockwave appears out of the beast and menacingly utters Prime's name, but he quickly withdraws.

He later appears during the final battle, where the Driller once again knocks over Optimus's trailer, and is attacked by the Wreckers so that the trailer could be retrieved. After noticing falling furniture from a building that Sam, Carly, Epps, and other soldiers are in, he sends the driller to collapse the building. After tipping the building over, Optimus Prime flies in with his jetpack and is able to kill the driller, cutting off its main head by flying through the section that connects it to the body. Angered by what happened to his pet, Shockwave shoots at Optimus with multiple rockets - causing him to fly out of control and get stuck in tangled tower crane wires. With Optimus out of the way, Shockwave and the Decepticons overpower the Autobots and prepare to execute them. After the Wreckers manage to free Optimus, they join the humans in a coordinated assault on Shockwave. He is eventually damaged badly, after getting temporarily blinded by parachutes before having an explosive detonated on his neck and then gets his eye partly shot out of his head by human soldiers, but he still refuses to fall. Optimus then flies in and attacks Shockwave, who fires a shell, but Optimus dodges it and punches through Shockwave's torso using bladed knuckles and kills him by completely ripping his eye out of his head. Optimus then uses Shockwave's hand cannon to blast the space bridge control pillar, temporarily halting Cybertron from transporting into Earth's atmosphere.

"Two-Heads", two-headed human-made KSI Transformers, are modeled from the remains of Shockwave, and later become Decepticons under Galvatron's control in ''Transformers: Age of Extinction''. One Two-Head is killed by Hound, while another is killed when Optimus sets off one of Lockdown's grenades. A photo of Shockwave listing him as deceased is also seen.

Transtech Shockwave received a full-page biography in issue #22 of the ''Transformers Collectors Club Magazine''. He used to work for the renegade Decepticon Jhiaxus as a scientist, but after Jhiaxus was destroyed was brought in by Megatron as a prisoner. Initially put on trial for war crimes he was freed by Megatron, who argued to Optimus Prime that Shockwave's mind would be an invaluable asset to them. Shockwave is a morally ambiguous Transtech with few actual weapons, in favor of a great number of in-built tools he uses for his craft.

Shockwave appeared in the 2008 BotCon voice actor play ''Bee in the City'', voiced by Chris Ho, also known as Vangelus. In this story [[Professor Sumdac]] attempted to create a teleportation system to get the Autobots to [[Cybertron]], but an interaction with [[Sari Sumdac]]'s key ended up transporting [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)|Optimus Prime]], [[Bumblebee (other incarnations)|Bumblebee]] and Sari to [[Transtech]] [[Cybertron]], where they met [[Flareup (Transformers)|Flareup]] and were detained by Shockwave. Bumblebee teamed up with ''Beast Wars'' Megatron to free his comrades, but then had to stop him from taking the key for himself. Afterwards the Autobots and Sari returned to their own dimension.

Transtech Shockwave appeared in story ''Transcendent'', where he kidnapped Breakaway for Transtech Megatron. After Shockwave discovered that certain systems in Breakaway were unique and might be useful Megatron requested permission from ''Transtech'' Ratbat to take the Autobot apart, even it may kill him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Shockwave_(TransTech) Shockwave (TransTech)] at the [http://tfwiki.net/ Transformers Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt; When Alpha Trion's forces raided the lab to free Skyfall Megatron opposed them, but they escaped to another dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lee| first = Forest| title = Transcendent Part 5| journal = Transformers Collectors Club Magazine| volume = 1 | issue = 23 | pages= 10–15 |date = October–November 2008 |url=http://transformersclub.com/_images/TFmag15.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This incarnation of Shockwave has the ability to change his body, using this power to assume the guise of [[Longarm (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Longarm]] in order to creep up the Autobot ranks and serve [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Megatron]] incognito. To further his guise, changing his actual G1 color scheme to a gray pattern, Shockwave provides his Longarm guise with an alt-mode like that of a burly rough terrain [[crane (machine)|crane]]. His actual alt-mode is heavily based on the tank mode of ''[[Transformers Armada]]'''s Megatron. Corey Burton reprises the English-accented, [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner-inspired]] voice for the character, but when Shockwave is in the disguise of Longarm, he speaks in an American accent. Furthermore, while this Shockwave's voice sounds identical to that of his G1 self, Longarm's voice sounds much younger than Shockwave himself. Corey Burton revealed Shockwave's inclusion in Season 2 arose from a between scenes conversation he had with the production team, regarding how little the original Shockwave actually had to do.

===Animated series===
During Autobot training, his double-agent status was almost discovered by [[Bumblebee (Transformers Animated)|Bumblebee]]. But thanks to Bumblebee believing the spy to be [[Waspinator#Transformers Animated|Wasp]], Shockwave managed to plant the evidence to have Wasp as his scapegoat. After successfully graduating from training, Longarm is eventually promoted to '''Prime''' rank, and made intel commander of Cybertron, allowing him full access to Autobot files, which he passes onto Megatron, who has him ensure Cybertron is left helpless as part of his master plan. In the two-part "A Bridge Too Close" episode, Shockwave informs Megatron that the Autobot who got the highest scores in the [[Space Bridge]] aptitude test is [[Bulkhead (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Bulkhead]], leading Megatron to capture the Autobot. When the rest of the earth Autobots try to rescue Bulkhead, they are captured themselves, and Shockwave appears on a screen to taunt Bumblebee with the truth of his [[double agent]] status, and the fact that he had an innocent Autobot (Wasp) imprisoned (this later led to Wasp becoming Waspinator).

After the "A Bridge Too Close" two-parter, he gained a more prominent role in Season 3, and returned in the season three premiere event "Transwarped". Appearing in his Longarm guise, he was waiting for Megatron's arrival until [[Blurr]] returned to Cybertron with information regarding Megatron's communications with the double agent. Once aware that no one else on Cybertron knows the truth yet, Shockwave attacks him and manages to use the base's walls to crush him, taking the remains to [[Cliffjumper (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Cliffjumper]] for disposal before being contacted by Megatron. When [[Ultra Magnus (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Ultra Magnus]] planned on making contact with the earth Autobots, Shockwave uses his guise to convince him to have all communication with them relayed through him, to keep his identity a secret, which is further endangered when the council begins to realize there's a spy in their team.

He next appeared in ''Where is thy Sting?'', infuriated that [[Jazz (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Jazz]], [[Sentinel Prime#Transformers Animated|Sentinel Prime]], [[Jetfire#Transformers: Animated|Jetfire]] and [[Jetstorm#Transformers Animated|Jetstorm]] were heading to Earth while after Wasp and attempting to get them to turn back, with Ultra Magnus "calming" him to let his group proceed with their mission. Fearing that his cover will be blown and unable to contact Megatron, Shockwave left a message for him that he would take matters into his own hands. At the episode's conclusion, once word of the truth came to Cybertron, [[Ironhide#Transformers Animated|Ironhide]] attempted to take him into prison, only to find the gravely injured Ultra Magnus lying on the floor, as Shockwave nearly assassinated him and stole his hammer before taking his leave into the long abandoned underground passageways to hide out.

He appeared in "This is Why I Hate Machines". When Megatron arrived to Cybertron in Omega Supreme, Shockwave began setting up a scheme to acquire the activation codes to Omega Supreme from the original Autobot who possessed them, [[Arcee#Transformers Animated|Arcee]]. His plans were slowed down when Ratchet and Captain Fanzone arrived on Cybertron and try to protect Arcee from the clutches of Shockwave. Because of this, Shockwave battled Ratchet several times through the episode, utilizing the stolen Magnus Hammer as his primary weapon. After taking care of the Autobot, he encounters his "old boss", [[Ultra Magnus (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Ultra Magnus]] and attempts to put him out of commission. He would have succeeded if Ratchet had not intervened. Though he lost Magnus' hammer in the fight, Shockwave escapes with Arcee, resuming his natural [[purple]] color scheme upon joining Megatron's group officially.

In the third-season finale (which also acted as the series' finale), Shockwave kept Arcee in an operating chamber, where he hooked her up to several wires. Once he received news that Megatron was going to make Omega Supreme clones, Shockwave once again used his Longarm disguise in an attempt to trick Arcee into giving Megatron Omega's activation codes, so that the three Omega clones could be brought online. When the attempt failed, Shockwave took the codes forcefully. However, the codes were missing an essential security patch, requiring Shockwave to set up a bypass, leaving [[Lugnut (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Lugnut]] to control the clones remotely from Omega. Shockwave later encountered Ratchet, Bumblebee, Bulkhead, and [[Sari Sumdac|Sari]], who had come to save Arcee, and engaged Bumblebee and Bulkhead in battle. Bulkead managed to catch him off guard, punching him to the ground and knocking away his cannon. Forgetting his color scheme, Shockwave took on his Longarm guise in a vain and desperate ploy to gain mercy. Bulkhead and Bumblebee were not fooled however and destroyed the cannon. Shockwave makes a final appearance in the show when he gets taken to Cybertron as a prisoner along with Megatron and Lugnut.

* '''''Animated'' Voyager Shockwave''' (2008)
:In keeping with his depiction on the show, Shockwave features four distinct modes; his normal robot mode and a shorter, stockier Longarm robot mode, each with its own alternate mode - a Cybertronian tank and crane, respectively. His faction insignia can be flipped between Autobot and Decepticon.
* '''''Animated'' Voyager Shockwave with Activators Bumblebee''' (2009)
:This figure is similar to the normal ''Animated'' Shockwave except in his season 3 finale color scheme. He is currently exclusive to [[Target Corporation|Target]] being packed along with Activators Bumblebee. Like his original Animated action figure, this toy can assume the guise of Longarm and his vehicle mode as well. The purple Longarm (robot mode only) made his first appearance in the final episode of season 3.

Shockwave started out as Megatron's pet "[[mad scientist]]" during his days as a gladiator.

===Books===
Appears in the novel ''Transformers: Exodus''. Shockwave is responsible for creating the [[Insecticons]], and creating the combiner technology - first the [[Combaticons]] who formed Bruticus Maximus and perfected it with the [[Constructicons]] who formed [[Devastator (Transformers)|Devastator]] (named after the Devastator Winds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-345-52252-8 |title=Transformers: Exodus - The Official History of the War for Cybertron |publisher=Del Rey Books |year=2010 |author=Alexander C. Irvine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also mentioned in ''[[Transformers: Exiles]]'', where he continues to lead the Decepticon effort to subjugate Cybertron in Megatron's absence. He communicates and meets with [[Alpha Trion]] several times, always seeking to intimidate the ancient archivist, only to be rebuffed. Militarily, his greatest opposition comes from the [[Wreckers (Transformers)|Wreckers]] under [[Ultra Magnus]].

Shockwave later appears in ''[[Transformers: Retribution]]'', where he captures Alpha Trion in order to gain access to the supercomputer [[Vector Sigma]], so that he may be able to create a Decepticon [[Matrix of Leadership]]. Somehow, the Curator, a [[Quintesson]] leader, manipulated Shockwave's motives of finding Vector Sigma, in order to rebuild the Space Bridges so that the Quintessons may take over Cybertron.

===Games===
Shockwave appears as [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|Megatron's]] [[second-in-command]] in the 2010 video game ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron]]''. While voiced by [[Steven Blum]] in the game, Shockwave was voiced by [[Corey Burton]] in the [[GameStop]] TV promo. Players can unlock him on the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] versions by entering a unique code supplied by GameStop (U.S.) and [[Blockbuster Video]] (UK). He is also unlockable on the [[Nintendo DS]] version and part of the first [[Downloadable content|DLC pack]] on the PC version.

In the TV promo, Megatron leaves Shockwave in charge while he is away. Shockwave revels in this, then orders [[Soundwave (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|Soundwave]] to transform into boombox mode and play "[[The Touch (Stan Bush song)|The Touch]]" while shooting several Autobots. [[Starscream#Transformers: Prime|Starscream]] (who is nearby) asks "Why this song?", to which Shockwave replies, "When your hit percentage exceeds mine, you may choose the soundtrack."

Shockwave appeared in ''[[Transformers: Fall of Cybertron]]'' where he has a larger role. Shockwave opens a space bridge to search the universe for energy to rebuild Cybertron. He soon finds dinosaurs on Earth and later he appllied these forms to a group of Autobots on Cybertron with [[Grimlock]] being one of them and calls them Dinobots. Shockwave later tries to control the new Dinobots by reducing their intelligence in favor of combat prowess, but they are still intelligent enough to rebel against him. Grimlock even bites off Shockwave's left arm during their battle for control of the space bridge, a reference to the original Shockwave's lack of a left arm, which is replaced by a cannon. Shockwave is presumed dead after Grimlock knocks him away. Even if Grimlock did not kill him, both Grimlock and Shockwave are likely dead from the destruction of the space bridge. It is not confirmed that they died by any means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/conventions-15/key-images-from-the-transformers-panel-at-nycc-173563/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animated series===
A flashback in the ''Transformers: Prime'' episode "Out of the Past" showed that Shockwave was in Kaon when Starscream was delivering energon to him. Starscream brought Arcee and Cliffjumper to Shockwave in order for him to extract the cryptic Autobot message from them. When asked by Starscream if he can extract the Autobot message from them, Shockwave stated to Starscream that he invented Cortical Psychic Patch. Shockwave successfully extracts the message from Arcee where it involved Optimus Prime giving the coordinates to Earth. When Shockwave plans to dispose of Cliffjumper, Starscream tells Shockwave that Cliffjumper is his. Shockwave acknowledges Starscream's orders and leaves. Arcee and Cliffjumper learn from Starscream that Shockwave is using the Energon to build a Space Bridge. Upon taking out two Vehicon guards, Arcee and Cliffjumper discover that Shockwave plans to use the Space Bridge to send the Decepticons to Earth to attack Optimus Prime before any other Autobot arrives. Shockwave arrives when Cliffjumper tries to distract the two Vehicon guards and attacks Arcee while she is sabotaging the Space Bridge. Cliffjumper then attacks Shockwave as Arcee takes out some Vehicons. Before Shockwave can shoot Cliffjumper, Arcee shoots part of a ceiling which knocks out Shockwave. When Shockwave tries to follow them, Arcee manages to shoot Shockwave in the head as Arcee and Cliffjumper successfully arrive on Earth. Before leaving to find Optimus Prime, Arcee and Cliffjumper are left wondering if Shockwave survived the Space Bridge's explosion.

In the third season entitled Beast Hunters, Knock Out finds Shockwave when he, some Vehicons, and some Insecticons were looking for the Iacon relics at the destroyed Omega Lock. He survived the Space Bridge explosion, but was lost on Cybertron and no Decepticons searched for him. He decided to use his time alone to move along with a lot of his projects until he saw the Decepticon search party and returned to Earth with Knock Out. After hearing Starscream's excuse why he wasn't looked for, he found his excuse logical. With Shockwave's return, Megatron established a new chain of command. While Starscream remained Megatron's second-in-command in terms of military activities, Shockwave became Megatron's second-in-command for scientific activities. While hunting Autobots with the Decepticons, Shockwave recommends one of his projects for it, a Predacon named Predaking who was under his control. Shockwave sends Predaking after the Autobots with some Energon from Wheeljack leaked during torture. But unfortunately the Predacon failed and Starscream made fun of the mute creature. Shockwave was present when Starsream was sending the decepticons to different parts of the globe. He later suggested to release Predaking on the Autobot intruders. But after that failed Shockwave decided to handle it himself. He managed to subdue Wheeljack and Bulkhead. He was later about to execute the Autobot prisoners until he got distracted by Optimus Prime's return. After the Autobots escaped, he returns to the Nemesis through the groundbridge sent by Soundwave before the remains of Darkmount fell on him.

In "Project Predacon," it was revealed that Shockwave once used his previous clones of Predacons to Earth back in ancient times. Optimus Prime discovers that the Decepticons are looking for fossil samples of the Predacons so that Shockwave can rebuild his Predacon army. Shockwave also had his Predacons microchipped, which made it easy to track their remains. When it came to one location, Shockwave ended up engaging Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Smokescreen. With help from Soundwave, Shockwave was able to obtain part of a Predacon fossil. While analyzing the Predacon fossil fragment, Shockwave is visited by Megatron who states that he heard of his encounter with Optimus Prime and how it would've been tragic if he had lost his best scientist in battle. Shockwave vows to Megatron that he will leave the fossil-fetching missions to Starscream and the Vehicons so that he can accelerate Project Predacon.

In "Evolution", it is revealed that Project: Predacon is nearing completion. After having Knock Out transport the synthetic energon to him, Shockwave finds that Predaking has learned to transform after Starscream angers him. He is present when Megatron orders Project: Predacon to be shut down before the Predacons can rebel. Shockwave surprisingly finds Megatron's decision to be logical. When Starscream puts his plan of having the Autobots destroy the Predacon clones without alerting Shockwave, Shockwave escapes the Wreckers, but first releases the Predacons which are later destroyed. He reports to Megatron later when he discovers freshly made Cybertronian alloy in his destroyed lab. He concludes that synthetic energon was the cause of what has transpired.

In "Minus One" and "Synthesis", Shockwave is working on the reconstruction of the Omega Lock, and the manufacturing of the synthetic energon. He finds the formula difficult to complete, and has Laserbeak retrieve Soundwave after he's captured, and bring Ratchet to the Nemesis. The two scientists end up working together to complete the cybermatter formula.

In the series finale "Deadlock", Shockwave is about to use the Omega Lock on Earth, but Ratchet attacks, and Shockwave easily defeats him, then the other Autobots arrive and Shockwave ends up being knocked down by Bumblebee. After Megatron is killed by Bumblebee, Starscream is distraught and swears vengeance on the Autobots, but Shockwave tries to calm him down and forces him and the other Decepticons to presumably head for Kaon. They then get into an escape pod and launch, landing somewhere on Cybertron.

===''Predacons Rising''===
In the movie, Shockwave and Starscream are the leaders of the Decepticons, and continue to relocate again and again to avoid detection from the Autobots. Together they revive Project Predacon, and have made two Predacons, Darksteel and Skylynx. Starscream later summons Shockwave to Predaking's grounds, where he has located many Predacon bones unearthed by the restoration of Cybertron. While they gather the bones, Unicron in Megatron's body comes over, and resurrects the dead Predacons with dark energon. Starscream runs but Shockwave attempts to fight off the zombies in tank mode, but is overrun and mauled by them. Later, when Predaking defeats his Predacon brethren, Shockwave is shown to have survived, and asks the Predacons to use their power more logically. It is unknown how he survived, or what happens to him afterwards.

'''Shockwave''' is a [[Decepticon]] whose skills are at relations between organisms, working as the ambassador between Earth and the Decepticons,along with both his ally and aid [[Fistfight (Transformer)|Fistfight]]. Calm, wizened, he's intelligent and patient, though no scientist. Like most Decepticons, he's more than willing to put his life on the line to save humans. Although his fighting techniques are entirely defensive, he's more than capable of putting a hole through any Autobot.

In his alternate identity, '''Longarm''', he is an Autotrooper officer. He was always kind of a wet blanket, but recently he's been acting really strangely and disappearing for long stretches of time without explanation. He's even started saying stuff like "Interrogative" and "Conclusion" before his sentences.

Shockwave's body is based on ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'' Shockblast. According to Trent Troop,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfw2005.com/boards/transformers-news-rumors/432147-new-tfcc-prose-story-4.html#post6360334]&lt;/ref&gt; his colors were chosen because they were the opposite of ''Generation 1'' Shockwave's.

Shockwave's ability to disguise himself as Longarm is a homage to ''[[Transformers Animated]]'' Shockwave, who infiltrated the Autobot ranks as Longarm. Longarm is a disguised Shockwave, but ''which'' Shockwave is still unrevealed.

===Fun Publications===
After mistaking [[Cliffjumper]] for his universe's Cliffjumper, [[Megatron]] mistakenly believed that his time in the Rad Zone had damaged his circuitry, and noted that perhaps they should have Shockwave take a look at him.

When the Decepticons got a two-way [[Space Bridge|Stellar Spanner]] going between [[Earth]] and [[Cybertron]], Megatron assigned Shockwave to Earth as an ambassador. Shockwave arrived at the base on Earth and was greeted by [[Starscream]] and Professor Arkeville. He was particularly interested in talking to [[Cliffjumper]], and hearing more about [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]]. Shockwave attended the unveiling of the Mega-Rig, aiming to meet R.J. Blackrock and Senator Shore. When a group of Autobots attacked the ceremony, Shockwave acted only in defense. The human [[Josie Beller|Sephie Beller]] came under threat from [[Seaspray (Transformers)|Seaspray]], and Shockwave acted quickly, taking the missile which would surely have killed her.

Though he was seriously damaged, he survived and was taken back to base for repairs. Sephie blamed herself for his injuries and got herself upgraded with Cybertronian technology. Though the other Decepticons didn't approve of it, Starscream's scans of her tech provided several vital tips to boost Shockwave's self-repair, saving his life. He was soon on his feet, albeit unsteadily, and greeted Sephie when the Decepticons brought her back to base.

Scrooge wants to ship the load to a remote island near Hawaii, but the Beagle Boys take over the ship and force Scrooge, Donald, and the nephews to do the dirty work on the voyage. Once in Hawaii, the Ducks are helped by the [[Menehune]]s, and the Beagle Boys are captured by the [[United States Navy]].

'''''The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses''''' was an early [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] era [[masque]], written by [[Samuel Daniel]] and performed in the Great Hall of [[Hampton Court Palace]] on the evening of Sunday, 8 January 1604. One of the earliest of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] Court masques,&lt;ref&gt;A masque for male courtiers was staged two days earlier, on 6 January 1604; the text has not survived.&lt;/ref&gt; staged when the new dynasty had been in power less than a year and was closely engaged in peace negotiations with Spain,&lt;ref&gt;The masque's theme of peace celebrated the ceasefire with Spain, proclaimed by King James in March 1603, and reflected the intense peace negotiations which were to culminate in the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]] at Somerset House in August 1604 and its ratification at Valladolid the following year. Present at the performance was the Spanish ambassador, [[Juan de Tassis y Peralta, 2nd Count of Villamediana|the count of Villamediana]], one of the Spanish negotiators of the treaty and a future writer of Spanish masques himself. Barroll (ed.), p 175.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses'' stood as a precedent and a pattern for the many masques that followed during the next four decades.

==Design==
The name of the masque's designer is not recorded in the historical sources; some scholars have argued that he may have been [[Inigo Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;Law, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; who had recently returned to England from the royal court of Anne's brother [[Christian IV of Denmark]], and so had a connection with her courtly establishment. The stage set had clear similarities with Jones's later masque work; the set for ''The Vision'' consisted of a large mountain, plus a Temple of Peace and a Cave of Sleep at the opposite end of the hall.

==The show==
Daniel's text draws on classical [[mythology]]. The presenters are [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], the [[Charites|Graces]], a Sybil, and personifications of Night and Sleep. (These speaking roles were taken by boys and men who were not aristocrats but lower Court functionaries. Aristocratic participants in Court masques generally did not take speaking roles.)&lt;ref&gt;For later exceptions to the rule, see ''[[The Gypsies Metamorphosed]]'' and ''[[The Shepherd's Paradise]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The musicians who played [[cornet]]s were dressed as [[satyr]]s.

In the masque, Night appears and awakens her son, Sleep, who calls forth a vision for the spectators with his wand (and promptly goes back to sleep). Iris appears at the top of the artificial mountain, and descends to the Temple of Peace, where she tells the Sybil about the coming of the goddesses. The Graces appear on the mountaintop and descend to the floor below, followed by twelve goddesses, descending three by three, to the music of the satyrs. Each goddess is followed by a torchbearer, dressed in white with gold stars. The dozen aristocrats parade to the Temple of Peace as the Graces sing; the main dances ensue.

==Cast==
The performance featured [[Anne of Denmark]], the queen consort of King [[James I of England|James I]], and eleven of the queen's ladies in waiting. They were attired as classical goddesses and danced in the masque; the Queen, curiously, did not take the obvious role of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], queen of the gods, but rather [[Athena|Pallas Athena]]. The dozen noble participants and their roles were:

{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
*Queen Anne.................Pallas
*[[Catherine Howard, Countess of Suffolk|Countess of Suffolk]]........Juno
*C. of Hertford................[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]
*[[Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford|C. of Bedford]]................[[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]
*C. of Derby............[[Proserpina|Proserpine]]
*[[Margaret Howard, Countess of Nottingham|C. of Nottingham]].....[[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]]
{{col-2}}
*[[Penelope Blount, Countess of Devonshire|Lady Rich]].....................[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]
*[[Elizabeth Hatton|Lady Hatton]]................[[Macaria]]
*[[Audrey Walsingham|Lady Walsingham]]........[[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]]
*[[Susan de Vere, Countess of Montgomery|Susan Vere]].....................[[Flora (mythology)|Flora]]
*Dorothy Hastings............[[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]]
*Elizabeth Howard..........[[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]]
{{col-end}}

==Costumes==
The ladies' costumes were sumptuous: "Juno" wore a "sky-colored mantle" embroidered with gold and peacock feathers, with a crown also of gold; "Diana" was dressed a "green mantle" embroidered with silver half moons, "with a croissant of pearls on her head."&lt;ref&gt;In Ernest Law's edition of the text, pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The costumes were created by ransacking the wardrobe of the dead [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], who had left some 500 gowns behind her when she died, many of them luxurious, some worn only once. These supplied cloth of silver and cloth of gold for the goddesses' garb.&lt;ref&gt;See Law's introduction to his edition, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with this frugality, the masque cost between two and three thousand pounds to stage. [[Lady Penelope Rich]] reportedly wore £20,000 worth of jewels while appearing the masque – though she was outdone by the Queen, who sported fully £100,000 in gems. (This kind of extreme display became characteristic of the courtly masques during the Stuart era, and was a focus of controversy and deep disapproval by wide segments of the public.) Anne carried a spear and wore a helmet and a tunic, embroidered with cannon and weapons of war, which ended just below the knee, quite an innovation for the time. As courtly humorist [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester|Dudley Carleton]] put it, "her clothes were not so much below the knee but that we might see a woman had both feet and legs which I never knew before."&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomacy==
Attendance at the masque was highly coveted, and grew to be a bone of contention among the Court's foreign ambassadors – another element that would become typical of future masques. The competition was so intense that the French ambassador, the Comte de Beaumont, actually threatened to kill his Spanish counterpart De Tassis in the King's presence if he couldn't attend.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 3, pp. 280–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Daniel's text for the masque was published in a 1604 [[book size|quarto]] by the bookseller [[Edward Allde]]. This was an unauthorised and defective printing; Daniel countered it with an authorised and accurate [[book size|octavo]] edition in the same year, issued by the stationer Simon Waterson. That edition bears Daniel's dedication of the work to his patroness [[Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford]], who had recommended him to Queen Anne for the commission; the dedication, at 210 lines, is the longest in English Renaissance drama.&lt;ref&gt;Bergeron, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The text was reprinted in quarto in 1623.

==Aftermath==
Daniel did well from the masque; he was made, firstly, a [[Groom of the Chamber|Groom of the Queen's Chamber]] and later a chamberlain; and the Queen gave him the job of licensing plays for the [[Children of the Chapel]], the troupe of child actors that Anne had just taken into her patronage as the Children of the Queen's Revels. His ascendancy was brief, however: later in 1604 Daniel got into trouble with the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] over a performance of his play ''Philotas,'' which was seen as a too-friendly commentary on the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Essex]] rebellion of 1601. Daniel bowed out of further masque-writing for the Court – though commentators wonder how voluntary his action was. [[Ben Jonson#Masques|Ben Jonson]] quickly took over as the principal (though not the sole) masque writer for the Stuarts. Daniel did make one more venture in masquing prior to his 1619 death; he composed ''Tethys' Festival'' for its summer 1610 performance.

'''The Watts Prophets''' are a group of [[musician]]s and [[poet]]s from  [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]], [[California]], United States.  Like their contemporaries [[The Last Poets]], the group combined elements of jazz music and spoken-word performance, making the trio one that is often seen as a forerunner of contemporary [[hip-hop music]]. Formed in 1967, the group comprised Richard Dedeaux, Father Amde Hamilton (born Anthony Hamilton), and [[Otis O'Solomon]] (also billed as Otis O'Solomon Smith) (O'Solomon removed the "Smith" from his name in the 1970s).

==History==
Hamilton, O'Solomon, and Dedeaux first met and collaborated at the [[Watts Writers Workshop]], an organization created by [[Budd Schulberg]] in the wake of the [[Watts Riots]], as the [[Civil Rights Movement]] was beginning to take a new cultural turn. Fusing music with [[jazz]] and [[funk]] roots, and rapid-fire, spoken-word poetry, they created a sound that gave them a considerable local following. They released two albums, 1969's ''The Black Voices: On the Streets in Watts'' and 1971's ''Rappin' Black in a White World'', which established a strong tendency toward social commentary and a reputation for militancy. The group was unable to secure another record deal; a promising deal with [[Bob Marley|Bob Marley's]] [[Tuff Gong]] label fell through after his passing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dave |date=March 30, 2001|title=Funk |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RIEjkWXZdrMC |publisher=Backbeat Books |page=54 |isbn=0879306297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to sustain success, the group has performed only sporadically since the mid-1970s.

In recent years, the group's profile has improved somewhat. The 1997 recording, ''When the 90's Came'', found them in the studio with pianist [[Horace Tapscott]], and a European tour reunited the trio with former collaborator [[DeeDee McNeil]]. In 2005, ''Things Gonna Get Greater: The Watts Prophets 1969-1971'' combined the group's first two efforts, bringing them back into print for the first time in more than a decade.

Amde Hamilton, who is a priest of the ancient [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]  can be seen performing a spoken-word piece at the 1981 funeral service of [[Bob Marley]] in Jamaica in the 1982 film ''[[Land of Look Behind]]''. Hamilton was the third American to be ordained as a priest of the ancient Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.

In 1994, the group appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation CD, ''[[Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool]]'', appearing on a track entitled "Apprehension" alongside [[Don Cherry]]. The album, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic in African-American society was named "Album of the Year" by ''[[Time Magazine]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Richard Dedeaux died in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/12/prweb11407702.htm |title=The Passing of Urban Griot Richard Dedeaux - A Watts Prophet &amp; "Original Rapper" |publisher=Prweb.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Christian Broadcasters''' ('''UCB''') is an international Christian broadcasting and media group. Through affiliates in twenty five countries, it operates radio and television stations and publishes and broadcasts [[Bob Gass]]'s free daily devotionals The Word for You Today and word4u2day.

The group was started in New Zealand by Richard Berry. In the early 1960s, the Christchurch evangelical was inspired by Ecuadorian Christian short-wave radio station [[HCJB]] to set up a radio station in his garage. The station became a permanent operation in 1976, and in subsequent years it expanded throughout New Zealand.

The Rhema model was used to establish UCB affiliates in Australia, the United Kingdom, other [[British Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] countries, and beyond. In July 2010, UCB United Kingdom's UCB TV partnered with the mobile TV and video on demand network Yamgo to launch the world's first ever live Christian mobile TV channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yamgo.com/phone-tv/worlds-first-christian-mobile-tv-channel-available-globally-as-yamgo-launch-ucb/ ''World’s First Christian Mobile TV Channel Available Globally As Yamgo Launch UCB'']{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at yamgo.com. Accessed on 2 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Word for You Today==

The Word For You Today is a free, daily [[prayer|devotional]] written by [[Bob Gass]] and distributed internationally by United Christian Broadcasters as a daily [[radio programme]], as website content, as an email newsletter and as quarterly print editions. One million copies of the United Kingdom and Ireland print edition are distributed each quarter to hospitals, rest homes, care facilities and UCB supporters. Other regional editions are distributed to subscribers, churches and Christian organisations in other parts of the world.

Bob Gass has described the devotionals as "a kick start for cold mornings, when you don't feel like reading your Bible or find it a bit dry". He started writing The Word for Today devotional readings in 1992 as various inspirations he had received in forty years of being involved in Christian leadership and from the Biblical principles instilled in him by his mother. After positive response in the United States, he offered international rights to the devotionals to United Christian Broadcasters CEO Gareth Littler, with a successful first print run of 3500 copies in 1994 being distributed to UCB supporters in the United Kingdom.

Following requests and planning, a contemporary youth version, ''The Word 4U 2Day'', was introduced in August 2003 in conjunction with [[Manchester]] Christian youth ministry The Message Trust. About 250,000 copies of the United Kingdom and Ireland print edition are distributed quarterly. The version is distributed by UCB youth stations as a [[radio programme]] and website content.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucb.co.uk/read ''The Word For Today &amp; Bob Gass''] at ucb.co.uk.

The company is based in Stoke-on-Trent. It did its initial broadcasts via [[Manx Radio]] in the [[Isle of Man]], although this gave limited geographical reach and only from 10&amp;nbsp;pm until 2&amp;nbsp;am, it did allow the station to bypass some of the UK's broadcasting laws and commence transmission earlier in the company's lifetime than would have otherwise been possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/music/UCB_Cross_Rhythms__A_marriage_made_in_heaven/40689/p1/|title=UCB Cross Rhythms:  A marriage made in heaven|work=crossrhythms.co.uk|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCB Media broadcasts [[Christian radio]] stations UCB 1 and 2 via National DAB, via their free Smartphone app, UCB Player as well as via their website and tunein. They also run a [[Christian television]] station UCB TV available online and via the UCB Player.

[[Rhema Media]] is the founding organisation of United Christian Broadcasting. It is also New Zealand's largest Christian media organisation, broadcasting four [[radio networks]] and a television station, and publishing the quarterly The Word for You Today devotional publication, from the Rhema Broadcasting Centre on Upper Queen Street in the central [[Auckland]] suburb of [[Newton, New Zealand|Newton]].

===Stations===

The group's flagship network, New Zealand's Rhema, is an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christian contemporary music|contemporary Christian]] radio network started in 1978. The initial programme/station manager, John McNeil, laid the groundwork for what became the network's relaxed talk and music format, in which a limited number of teaching programmes are intermingled with music, news and interviews.

Other stations include Southern Star, which plays classic [[contemporary Christian music]] and [[hymns]], Life FM, a [[contemporary Christian music|contemporary Christian]] [[contemporary hit radio|hit radio]] network, and The Word, which broadcasts Bible readings. Rhema Media also operate Christian television channel Shine TV, which is available on [[Sky Television (New Zealand)|Sky Television]]. UCB International previously owned, but never utilised, a network of New Zealand UHF stations now used by [[Prime (New Zealand)|Prime TV]].

==Vision Christian Media Australia==

Vision Christian Media (formerly UCB Australia) operates the nationwide network "Vision Christian Radio", (previously called Vision Radio Network and Vision FM). It also publishes ''The Word for Today'' and ''word4U2day'', coordinates the ''Vision Christian Prayer'' prayer ministry and provides mailorder Christian resource service ''Vision Christian Store''. It was featured in the [[Andrew Denton]] documentary film [[God on My Side]]. Vision's motto is "Connecting Faith to Life" and the radio network aims to make Christian Radio available for every Australian as a means to that end.

As at the close of 2008, Vision operated on over 360 licences, including low powered services in metropolitan suburbs and rural towns. It also operated some higher powered services in some regional areas and in Western Melbourne on 1611 AM. By mid 2015, Vision had expanded to over 600 relay stations, mainly LPON licences (low power open narrowcast) but also including Adelaide 1611 AM. Vision's talk and music programming is aimed at "unpacking" what it means to follow [[Jesus Christ]] in an understandable way.

===Early history===

Vision began broadcasting from small studios in Springwood, [[Brisbane, Australia]] on 1 February 1999. A few years later they moved into larger premises in nearby Underwood to better provide a 24-hour 7-day broadcast to some 300+ relay stations across the nation, plus listeners on the Internet and via satellite. Vision has been able to acquire over 600 high- and low-powered open narrowcast licenses and has quickly gone about the task of setting up a national network of relay stations across Australia, from the largest cities to regional centres and tiny isolated towns in the bush.

Many small to medium-sized country towns in Australia have benefited from the cost-effective approach of using low-powered FM transmitters. Although typically only one to ten watts, they usually give quite adequate residential coverage in small towns, depending on the antenna height above local terrain. The setup cost is very achievable for most communities and the ongoing cost is minimal due to low maintenance equipment with low power consumption – some even use solar power in remote areas.

===Expansion===

In the twelve months following March 2001 a rapid expansion began, seeing the number of relay stations 'on-air' triple from around 30 to 90. Also in April 2001, Vision introduced Australia's first nationwide news service from a Christian perspective. Vision's News service is heard across their own network, as well as being accessed by a growing number of community stations who don't have the resources to produce their own news content. During 2003 Vision had opportunity to secure its first high powered open narrowcast licences, which were soon put on air.

The network quickly reached 150 relay stations by the end of 2003, and in the following year would see its first foray into AM radio sites in [[Shepparton]], [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]] and [[Kalgoorlie]]. Just prior to Christmas 2004 a further 17 High Powered licences were secured to be on air the following year. Vision's 200th relay station was powered up on Australia Day 2005 at the Central Australian town of [[Yulara]] – right next to Uluru (Ayers Rock). [[Yarrawonga]] in Victoria had the honour of station number 300 in late 2007 and a significant development occurred in late 2008 with the unexpected acquisition of a medium powered AM service in Melbourne (1611AM).

'''Yowie''' is a confectionery and publishing brand originating in Australia in 1995 by Cadbury and Kidcorp. It was one of the top selling chocolates in Australia in the late 1990s and early 2000s, selling over a million units a week.
After a break of nearly a decade, Yowie relaunched in 2014 for US markets.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-13/yowie-chocolates-relaunched-for-us-markets/5656016 Yowie Chocolates Relaunched for US Markets]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Yowie began as the brainchild of English-born advertising man, illustrator and author [[Geoffry Morgan Pike|Geoff Pike]]. After serving in the navy, Pike jumped ship in Australia, finding work as a [[jackaroo (trainee)|jackaroo]] on remote cattle stations. He became enchanted by Australia’s outback and its unique wildlife, and devoted his free time to nursing injured and orphaned animals back to health.

Many decades later, after a successful career in advertising, Pike drew on these early bush experiences and his love of wild places to create the Yowie Kingdom, a fictional magical realm free of the destructive influence of humanity, where threatened wildlife finds a safe haven. 

Inspired by Australian folklore, Pike borrowed the mythical man-like creature the [[Yowie]], reputed to roam the Australian bush. To watch over the fictional Yowie Kingdom and its animals and plants, Pike created six Yowie characters, each related to a well-known Australian animal, and each one guardian of key wild habitats:

* Boof the Bottlebrush Yowie, cousin of the [[bandicoot]], protector of rainforests and mountains
* Crag the Mangrove Yowie: cousin of the [[Freshwater crocodile|croc]][[Saltwater crocodile|odile]], protector of swamps and wetlands
* Ditty the Lillipilli Yowie: cousin of the [[wombat]], protector of woodlands and meadows
* Nap the Honeygum Yowie: cousin of the [[koala]], protector of forests and bushland
* Rumble the Redgum Yowie: cousin of the [[red kangaroo]], protector of deserts and plains
* Squish the Fiddlewood Yowie: cousin of the [[platypus]], protector of rivers and streams

Additional characters included animal companions for each of the six Yowie and Balthizar the [[Bunyip]], ruler of the Yowie Kingdom. To represent the threats facing the world’s natural habitats and threatened species, Pike created the Grumkin, careless creatures constantly seeking to destroy the harmony of the Yowie Kingdom. The Grumkins were: Munch (careless building, enemy of Rumble), Blob ([[pollution]], enemy of Crag), Ooz (also pollution, enemy of Squish), Spark (careless firelighting, enemy of Nap), Slob (littering, enemy of Ditty) and Chomp the Tiger Toothed Tree Chomper (deforestation, enemy of Boof).

Continuing with the development of the Yowie concept and characters, Pike enlisted the aid of long-time friend, fellow advertising man and best-selling author [[Bryce Courtenay]]. They hit upon the idea of a confectionery product as a vehicle for Yowie, and in 1994 pitched the concept to confectionery giant [[Cadbury]]. 

After three years developing the characters and the manufacturing process, in 1997 Cadbury launched Yowie as a foil-wrapped character-shaped milk chocolate shell containing a plastic capsule. Within the capsule was a multi-part collectable model of a native Australian or New Zealand animal, together with a leaflet featuring information, a photo of the animal and assembly instructions for the collectable. The first series featured 50 animals, plus figurines of each of the six Yowie characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullyloaded.com.au/news/logistics/1303/yowie-wrapped-to-launch-in-us/|title = Yowie Wrapped to Launch in US|accessdate =29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cadbury Yowie was selling over one million units weekly and in its first year sold 2.5 Yowies for every man, woman and child in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businesscasestudies.co.uk/cadbury-schweppes/the-importance-of-cause-related-marketing/launching-a-product.html#axzz3BmhgxYnS|title = The Importance of Cause Related Marketing:A Cadbury Schweppes Case Study|accessdate =29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand won multiple industry awards in Australia and internationally, including Best Global Supermarket Product and Best Global Confectionery Product at the 1997 [[SIAL Paris|Sial international food industry awards]] in Paris. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

A Yowie collector scene soon emerged with collector clubs forming across Australia and New Zealand and websites devoted to displaying and swapping Yowie collectables.

Cadbury Yowie was also released in Singapore, Japan and the UK.

==Publishing and merchandising==

To coincide with the release of Cadbury Yowie, a series of Yowie books was released, telling the stories of the Yowie characters as they protect their domains from the threat of the Grumkin. Written by Geoff Pike and Bryce Courtenay and illustrated by award-winning artists Christopher Minos and Helen Steele, the series sold more than 2 million copies, topping the Australian best-seller lists for children’s books. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Numerous lines of Yowie merchandise were produced, including soft toys, clothing, games, activity books, and Yowie music CDs.

==Further Yowie series==

Following the success of the first series of Yowie collectables, a second series was released in 1998, this time featuring 50 new animals.

The third series of Yowie, released in early 1999, was composed of 50 figurines and 6 limited edition mini Grumkins. This series remained the most common of all the series, extending into 2002, with further scattered releases until the series ended in 2005.

The fourth series was released in late 1999 and featured ‘Yowie World’ collectables, with animals from beyond Australia and New Zealand, as well as 6 limited edition crystal Yowies, 6 ‘Yowie playmates’ and a Lord Balthizzar figurine. It remained the second-most popular series, extending until 2005.

===Yowie and the Lost Kingdoms===

In 2000, Yowie teamed up with the [[Australian Museum]] to create Yowie and the Lost Kingdoms, the series of collectables featuring extinct animals from around the world and across the geological ages, including dinosaurs and other reptiles as well as extinct Australian megafauna. The Lost Kingdoms series was based on illustrations by Dr Anne Musser of the Australian Museum and masterminded by the director of the museum Dr Michael Archer. The museum presented an exhibition of fossils and reconstructions linking to the series. Additionally, the packaging got overhauled so that the wrappers of the Lost Kingdoms Yowies could be distinguished by the sign and shovel being held in their paws. 

Series A had 50 prehistoric figurines and 6 limited edition skulls. It was later replaced by Series B, released in 2001, which had 30 figurines and 6 limited edition glow-in-the-dark dinosaurs. In 2002 the third and final series, Series C, was released, with 30 figurines and 6 limited edition dazzling dinosaurs.

===Yowie Adventures===

In 2001, Yowie Adventures was released, based around comic-strip stories in which the Yowie and their friends save endangered animals from the onslaught of the Grumkin. The series had 30 figurines, and was often regarded as the rarest series,considering supplies seemed limited. It is the most highly sought-after series of all Yowies.{{cn|date=September 2012}} The series consisted of 6 animals, 6 enemies, 6 "yurts", 6 helpers and 6 transports. The series was updated in 2002 with a second release with 30 figurines, similar to the previous series, except more animals appeared in this series and the Yowie and helpers were replaced with Grumkins and helpers.

===Yowie Forgotten Friends===

In 2003 and 2004, Yowie Forgotten Friends was released. Featuring recently extinct animals, the series highlighted the increasing levels of species extinction and the importance of protecting threatened wildlife and habitats. The Forgotten Friends Series A comprised 30 figurines, with six glow-in-the-dark Yowie. In 2004, Series B of the Forgotten Friends range was released, this time with five limited edition glow-in-the-dark Grumkins. Spark was left out as it was regarded as a bad message to children.

==Yowie relaunch==

Production of Cadbury Yowie was discontinued in 2005 following a dispute between Cadbury and the Yowie creators. In 2012 a new company, Yowie Group, was formed to relaunch the brand. A series of 24 solid one-piece collectables, including 18 animals and six Yowie character models, was designed and manufactured. The one-piece format enabled far more lifelike collectables as well as improved product safety.

The first series features the following animals:

* African Grass Owl
* Alpaca
* American Bison
* Brown Bear
* Caracal
* Common Clownfish 
* Emperor Penguin
* European Rabbit 
* Fennec Fox
* Galapagos Tortoise
* Giant Anteater
* Giant Panda
* Gray Wolf
* North American Beaver
* Platypus
* Polar Bear
* Red Kangaroo
* Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat

Production of the chocolate and final assembly was taken over by [[Whetstone Chocolates]], based in Florida.

In July 2014, the first new Yowie products went on sale in the US.  

Yowie products returned to Australian retail shelves in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chung |first1=Frank |title=Yowies are finally back in Australia |url=https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/yowies-are-finally-back-in-australia/news-story/ccc9d6e76d8684237d4976aa94a4d1b8 |website=News.com.au |accessdate=23 July 2018 |date=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
