"'''7 O'Clock News/Silent Night'''" is a song by American music duo [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]] from their third [[studio album]], ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]'' (1966). The track is [[sound collage]] juxtaposing a rendition of the [[Christmas carol]] "[[Silent Night]]" with a simulated "[[News program|7 O'Clock News]]" bulletin of the actual events of August 3, 1966.

==Composition==
The track is a [[sound collage]] and simply constructed: it consists of the duo singing "[[Silent Night]]" two-part [[harmony]] over an [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] [[piano]] section.{{sfn|Bennighof|2007|p=32}} The voice of the newscaster is that of [[Charlie O'Donnell]], then a radio disc jockey. As the track progresses, the news report assumes a greater presence through an increase in volume. "The result rather bluntly makes an ironic commentary on various social ills by juxtaposing them with tenderly expressed Christmas sentiments."{{sfn|Bennighof|2007|p=32}} The mix on the track purposefully clashes with the piano accompaniment mixed solely to the left channel and the news solely to the right channel while vocals remain in the middle.

{{History of Georgia (country)}}
{{History of Abkhazia}}
The '''Abkhaz–Georgian conflict''' involves [[ethnic conflict]] between [[Georgians]] and the [[Abkhaz people]] in [[Abkhazia]], a ''de facto'' independent, partially recognized republic. In a broader sense, one can view the Georgian–Abkhaz conflict as part of a [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] conflict in the [[Caucasus]] region, intensified at the end of the 20th century with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.

The conflict, one of the bloodiest in the post-Soviet area, remains unresolved. The Georgian government has offered substantial [[autonomy]] to Abkhazia several times. However, both the Abkhaz government and the opposition in Abkhazia refuse any form of union with Georgia. Abkhaz regard their independence as the result of a war of liberation from Georgia, while Georgians believe that historically Abkhazia has always formed part of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfaapsny.org/en/information/index.php?ID=2739|title=The staff of the Foreign Ministry of Abkhazia laid a wreath at the memorial in the Park of Glory on the Memorial Day of Fatherland Defenders|work=mfaapsny.org|accessdate=28 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305024110/http://mfaapsny.org/en/information/index.php?id=2739|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgians formed the single largest ethnic group in pre-war Abkhazia, with a 45.7% plurality as of 1989 but {{as of |2014 | lc = on}} most Georgians left in Abkhazia want to remain independent of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/03/20/how-people-in-south-ossetia-abkhazia-and-transnistria-feel-about-annexation-by-russia/|title=How people in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Transnistria feel about annexation by Russia|author=Gerard Toal|date=20 March 2014|work=Washington Post|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many{{quantify|date=June 2015}} accuse the government of [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] (in office 1992-2003) of the initiation of senseless hostilities, and then of ineffective conduct of the war and post-war diplomacy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} During the war the Abkhaz separatist side carried out an [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|ethnic cleansing]] campaign which resulted in the expulsion of up to 250,000 ethnic Georgians and in the killing of more than 15,000.&lt;ref&gt;US State Department, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1993, Abkhazia case&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chervonnaia, Svetlana Mikhailovna.

==Background==
===Soviet era===
Both Abkhazia and Georgia were annexed into the [[Russian Empire]] in the nineteenth century, and remained part of it until the [[Russian Revolutions]] of 1917. While Georgia initially joined the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]] and subsequently became independent as the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] (DRG) in 1918, Abkhazia was initially controlled by a group of [[Bolsheviks]], before ultimately joining the DRG, though its status was never clarified.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welt|2012|pp=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Red Army invaded Abkhazia and Georgia]], eventually incorporating them into the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]]. Initially Abkhazia was formed as an independent [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]], the [[Socialist Soviet Republic of Abkhazia]] (SSR Abkhazia), though it was united with the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] by a treaty; in 1931 the SSR Abkhazia was downgraded to an autonomous republic within the Georgian SSR, to much opposition from the Abkhaz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saparov|2015|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Soviet era the Abkhazians called for their quasi-independent status to be restored. Demonstrations in support of this occurred in 1931 immediately after the dissolution of the SSR Abkhazia, and again in 1957, 1967, 1978, and 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lakoba|1995|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, 130 representatives of the Abkhaz intelligentia signed a letter to the Soviet leadership, protesting against what they saw as [[Georgianization]] of Abkhazia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewitt|1993|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War in Abkhazia===
{{Main|War in Abkhazia (1992–93)}}

The conflict involved a war in Abkhazia, which lasted for 13 months, beginning in  August, 1992, with Georgian government forces and a militia composed of ethnic Georgians who lived in Abkhazia and Russian-backed separatist forces consisting of ethnic [[Abkhaz people|Abkhazian]]s, [[Armenians]] and [[Russians]] who also lived in Abkhazia. The separatists were supported by the North Caucasian and [[Cossack]] militants and (unofficially) by Russian forces stationed in [[Gudauta]]. The conflict resulted in an [[Sochi agreement|agreement in Sochi]] to cease hostilities, however, this would not last.

===Resumption of hostilities===
{{Main|War in Abkhazia (1998)|2001 Kodori crisis}}

In April–May 1998, the conflict escalated once again in the Gali District when several hundred Abkhaz forces entered the villages still populated by Georgians to support the separatist-held parliamentary elections. Despite criticism from the opposition, Eduard Shevardnadze, [[President of Georgia]], refused to deploy troops against Abkhazia. A [[ceasefire]] was negotiated on May 20. The hostilities resulted in hundreds of casualties from both sides and an additional 20,000 Georgian refugees.

In September 2001, around 400 Chechen fighters and 80 Georgian guerrillas appeared in the [[Kodori Valley]] in extremely controversial conditions. The Chechen-Georgian paramilitaries advanced as far as Sukhumi, but finally were repelled by Abkhaz and Gudauta based Russian peacekeepers.

===Saakashvili era===
The new Georgian government of President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] promised not to use force and to resolve the problem only by diplomacy and political talks.&lt;ref name="Today"&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/europe/176_abkhazia_today.ashx Abkhazia Today.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215012229/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/europe/176_abkhazia_today.ashx |date=2011-02-15 }} ''The [[International Crisis Group]] [[Europe]] Report N°176, 15 September 2006, page 10''. Retrieved on May 30, 2007. ''Free registration needed to view full report''&lt;/ref&gt;

While at a [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) summit it was decided to exclude any contact with separatists; the trans-border economic cooperation and transport between Abkhazia and Russia grows in scale, with Russia claiming that all this is a matter of private business, rather than state.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Georgia also decries the unlimited issuing of Russian passports in Abkhazia with subsequent payment of retirement pensions and other monetary benefits by Russia, which Georgia considers to be economic support of separatists by the Russian government.&lt;ref name="Today"/&gt;

In May 2006 the Coordinating Council of Georgia’s Government and Abkhaz separatists was convened for the first time since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unomig.org/data/file/840/RFE_RL_INTERVIEW.pdf "UN Representative Says Abkhazia Dialogue Is Positive"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830231326/http://unomig.org/data/file/840/RFE_RL_INTERVIEW.pdf |date=August 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late July the [[2006 Kodori crisis]] erupted, resulting in the establishment of the [[Government of Abkhazia-in-exile|de jure Government of Abkhazia]] in [[Kodori Valley|Kodori]]. For the first time after the war, this government is located in Abkhazia, and is headed by [[Malkhaz Akishbaia]], [[Temur Mzhavia]] and [[Ada Marshania]].&lt;ref&gt;Tbilisi-Based Abkhaz Government Moves to Kodori, Civil Georgia, July 27, 2006.

Currently, the Abkhaz side demands reparations from the Georgian side of $13 billion in US currency for damages in this conflict. The Georgian side dismisses these claims.&lt;ref name=rian070911&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20070911/77972132.html|title=Abkhazia demands Georgia pay $13 bln war compensation|author=Sputnik|date=11 September 2007|work=rian.ru|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 15, 2008 [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted resolution recognising the right of all refugees (including victims of reported “ethnic cleansing”) to return to Abkhazia and their property rights. It "regretted" the attempts to alter pre-war demographic composition and called for the "rapid development of a timetable to ensure the prompt voluntary return of all refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2008/ga10708.doc.htm GENERAL ASSEMBLY ADOPTS RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING RIGHT OF RETURN BY REFUGEES, INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS TO ABKHAZIA, GEORGIA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917010019/http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2008/ga10708.doc.htm |date=2008-09-17 }}, 15.05.2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2012, the [[OSCE Parliamentary Assembly]] passed a resolution at its annual session in [[Monaco]], underlining Georgia’s territorial integrity and referring to breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia as “occupied territories”. The resolution “urges the Government and the Parliament of the Russian Federation, as well as the de facto authorities of Abkhazia, Georgia and South Ossetia, Georgia, to allow the European Union Monitoring Mission unimpeded access to the occupied territories.” It also says that the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly is “concerned about the humanitarian situation of the displaced persons both in Georgia and in the occupied territories of Abkhazia, Georgia and South Ossetia, Georgia, as well as the denial of the right of return to their places of living.” The Assembly is the parliamentary dimension of the OSCE with 320 lawmakers from the organization’s 56 participating states, including Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscepa.org/publications/all-documents/doc_download/1258-final-declaration-english ''OSCE Parliamentary Assembly from 5 to 9 July 2012, Final Declaration and Resolutions'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 2008, the [[Russo-Georgian War]] spread to Abkhazia, where separatist rebels and the Russian air force launched an all-out attack on Georgian forces. Abkhazia's pro-Moscow separatist President [[Sergei Bagapsh]] said that his troops had launched a major "military operation" to force Georgian troops out of the Kodori Gorge, which they still controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/10/georgia.russia3 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Georgia under all-out attack in breakaway Abkhazia | first=Luke | last=Harding | date=August 10, 2008 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this attack, Georgian troops were driven out of Abkhazia entirely.

On August 26, 2008, the Russian Federation officially recognized both South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states.&lt;ref name="recognition"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Russia's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the Georgian government announced that the country cut all diplomatic relations with Russia and that it left the Commonwealth of Independent States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7588428.stm "Georgia breaks ties with Russia"] BBC News. Accessed on August 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the war===
Relations between Georgia and Abkhazia have remained tense after the war. Georgia has moved to increase Abkhazia's isolation by imposing a [[Georgian sea blockade of Abkhazia|sea blockade]] of Abkhazia. During the opening ceremony of a new building of the Georgian Embassy in [[Kiev]] ([[Ukraine]]) in November 2009 [[Georgian President]] [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] stated that residents of [[South Ossetia]] and Abkhazia could also use its facilities  "I would like to assure you, my dear friends, that this is your home, as well, and here you will always be able to find support and understanding".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/25516/ Yuschenko, Saakashvili open new building of Georgian Embassy in Kyiv] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123214158/http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/25516/ |date=November 23, 2009 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (November 19, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ziyad ibn Abdullah ibn Yazid ibn Mu'awiyah''',&lt;ref name="Tabari162"&gt;Al-Tabari, ed. Hillenbrand 2015, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known as '''Abu Muhammad al-Sufyani''', was an [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] nobleman and a [[pretender]] to the Umayyad Caliphate, which had been overthrown by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in early 750. Abu Muhammad led a revolt against the Abbasids, but his forces were defeated and he fled to [[Hejaz|Arabia]], where he was killed in the early part of the Abbasid Caliph [[al-Mansur]]'s reign.

==Biography==
===Origins===
Abu Muhammad was a member of the Umayyad family, related to Caliph [[al-Walid II]] ({{reign}} 743–744) through the latter's grandmother.&lt;ref name="Tabari162"/&gt; He adopted the name "al-Sufyani" as both a reference to his descent from [[Muawiyah I|Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan]] and a claim to being the early Islamic messianic figure, [[Sufyani|al-Sufyani]]. Abu Muhammad's messianic claim was embraced by many in [[Bilad al-Sham|Islamic Syria]], particularly the people of [[Homs]], who believed him to be a [[messiah]]-like figure who would destroy the rising Abbasid Caliphate.&lt;ref name="Cobb47"&gt;Cobb 2001, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Umayyad Caliph [[Marwan II]] (r. 744–750) had Abu Muhammad imprisoned in [[Harran]] for much of the second half of his reign. Abu Muhammad did not escape his incarceration when other inmates broke out; those inmates who did were caught and killed by Harran's inhabitants. Marwan released Abu Muhammad after his defeat by the Abbasids at the [[Battle of the Zab]] in January 750.&lt;ref&gt;Najeebabadi 2001, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolt===
Later in 750, the [[Qais|Qaysi]] general, [[Abu al-Ward]], launched a revolt to defeat the Abbasids, rallying his kinsmen and other Qaysis and disavowing his allegiance to the Abbasid governor of Syria, Abdullah ibn Ali. Abu Muhammad joined the revolt as a leader of the Yamani tribal confederation of Homs and [[Palmyra]]. Abu Muhammad assumed political leadership of the revolt and issued a claim to leadership of the Umayyad Caliphate, reaching out for support from other Umayyad nobles. Abu al-Ward, meanwhile, served as the revolt's military commander. Although the intent of the revolt was to combat the Abbasids, particularly their [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]i soldiers, it became a joint Qaysi–Yamani effort to gain control of the Umayyad Caliphate.&lt;ref name="Cobb47"/&gt;
[[File:Balami - Tarikhnama - Abu'l-'Abbas al-Saffah is proclaimed the first 'Abbasid Caliph (cropped).jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The first Abbasid caliph [[As-Saffah|al-Saffah]] as he receives [[Bay'ah|pledges of allegiance]] in [[Kufa]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

Despite an initial victory against the Abbasids led by Abd al-Samad ibn Ali at [[Qinnasrin]], Abu Muhammad's forces were defeated near Homs. In the latter battle, Abu al-Ward and many of his kinsmen and Qaysi soldiers were killed, while Abu Muhammad fled to the desert town of Palmyra. The Abbasid commander Bassam ibn Ibrahim attempted and failed to capture Palmyra, but Abu Muhammad fled again, this time heading for [[Hejaz|Arabia]]. There, he found a safe haven near [[Mount Uhud|Uhud]]. Abu Muhammad and his family remained in Arabia until they were tracked down and killed during Caliph [[al-Mansur]]'s reign (r. 754–775). Abu Muhammad's revolt, although short-lived, was the most significant threat the Abbasids faced in the period immediately following their successful [[Abbasid Revolution|revolution]] against the Umayyads. The revolt motivated the Abbasids to track down and eliminate other remnants of the Umayyad dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb 2001, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Sufyani''==
The origin, role and identity of the ''Sufyani'' in Islamic tradition and Abu Muhammad's place in it is much debated. In the local Syrian context, the ''Sufyani'' was seen as a deliverer who would herald a golden age. But in [[Shi'ite]] tradition, due to his descent from [[Abu Sufyan]]—originally an opponent of [[Muhammad]] and the father of [[Mu'awiya]], who was responsible for the downfall of [[Ali]]—he was an anti-Muslim figure, a sort of [[Dajjal|Islamic Antichrist]] and the opponent of the ''[[Mahdi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb 2011, pp. 275–276&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have debated the roots of this figure, with some claiming the existence of the legend already during Umayyad times. [[Henri Lammens]] suggested that Abu Muhammad was the origin of the legend, and that Syrians believed that after his execution he went into hiding—much like the Shi'ite ''Mahdi''—and would reappear. [[Wilferd Madelung]] championed the view that the ''Sufyani'' was from the beginning an anti-''Mahdi'' figure, and that he only acquired positive connotations in Syria at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;Roggema 2009, pp. 72–76&lt;/ref&gt; Several later rebels in Syria, from [[Abu Harb al-Mubarqa]] in the 840s all the way up to the 15th century, claimed the mantle of the ''Sufyani''.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb 2011, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Against All Hope''''' is a 1982 autobiography drama film about an alcoholic Cecil Moe on the verge of suicide and turns to a local clergy for help. It marked [[Michael Madsen]]'s film debut.

==Plot==
Cecil Moe's ([[Michael Madsen]]) life altered when he was thirteen years old. His mother dies and his new stepmother is abusive. She even orders him off his father's farm. During the [[second world war]] Cecil enlists in the [[US navy]]. His father passes away at the hands of his stepmother. This causes Cecil to drink heavily. It doesn't take long until he is addicted.

Cecil soon marries a young woman named Jeane and has a family. However, his drinking causes him to do unthinkable things. His eldest son mistakenly drinks one of his beers, when he carelessly leaves it on the living-room floor. His drinking soon costs him his job, his home, and nearly his family. 

One day Cecil returns home and becomes violent with Jeane. She plans to leave him first thing in the morning. Cecil quickly comes back to reality and seeks help immediately. He goes to a local reverend for guidance. The reverend tells Cecil to ask God for forgiveness. Cecil does and reconciles with Jeane. From that day forward, Cecil never drank and welcomes his new life.

'''Arbor Day''' (or '''Arbour'''; from the Latin ''arbor'', meaning ''tree'') is a [[secular holiday|holiday]] in which individuals and groups are encouraged to plant [[tree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=David|title=‘Plant trees’: the foundations of Arbor Day in Australia|url=http://www.tandfonline.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/doi/citedby/10.1080/14601170903010200?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true.|journal=Studies in the History of Gardens &amp; Designed Landscapes|volume=30|issue=1|pages=77–93|doi=10.1080/14601170903010200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many countries observe such a holiday. Though usually observed in the spring, the date varies, depending on [[climate]] and suitable planting season.

[[File:Fiesta del arbol.jpg|thumb|The naturalist [[Miguel Herrero Uceda]] at the monument to the first Arbor Day in the world, [[Villanueva de la Sierra]] ([[Spain]]) 1805]]

=== First Arbor Day in the world ===
The Spanish village of Mondoñedo held the first documented arbor plantation festival in the world organized by its mayor in 1594. The place remains as Alameda de los Remedios and it is still planted with [[lime (fruit)|lime]] and [[Aesculus hippocastanum|horse-chestnut]] trees. A humble granite marker and a bronze plate recall the event. Additionally, the small Spanish village of Villanueva de la Sierra held the first modern Arbor Day, an initiative launched in 1805 by the local priest with the enthusiastic support of the entire population.

{{Quote|While Napoleon was ravaging Europe with his ambition in this village in the Sierra de Gata lived a priest, don Juan Abern Samtrés, which, according to the chronicles, "convinced of the importance of trees for health, hygiene, decoration, nature, environment and customs, decides to plant trees and give a festive air. The festival began on Carnival Tuesday with the ringing of two bells of the church, and the Middle and the Big. After the Mass, and even coated with church ornaments, don Juan, accompanied by clergies, teachers and a large number of neighbours, planted the first tree, a poplar, in the place known as Valley of the Ejido. Tree plantations continued by Arroyada and Fuente de la Mora. Afterwards, there was a feast, and did not miss the dance. The party and plantations lasted three days. He drafted a manifesto in defence of the trees that was sent to surrounding towns to spread the love and respect for nature, and also he advised to make tree plantations in their localities.|[[Miguel Herrero Uceda]]|Arbor Day}}

=== First American Arbor Day ===
[[File:Birdsey Northrop.jpg|thumb|Birdsey Northrop]]
The first American Arbor Day was originated in [[Nebraska City, Nebraska]] by [[Julius Sterling Morton|J. Sterling Morton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morton|first=Sterling J.|date=|title=Arbor Day|url=|journal=Academic Search Complete|volume=|pages=|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 1872, an estimated one million trees were planted in [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

Birdsey Northrop of [[Connecticut]] was responsible for globalizing the idea when he visited [[Japan]] in 1883 and delivered his Arbor Day and Village Improvement message. In that same year, the [[American Forestry Association]] made Northrop the Chairman of the committee to campaign for Arbor Day nationwide. He also brought his enthusiasm for Arbor Day to [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Arbor Day"&gt;{{Citation|title=Birdsey Grant Northrop|url=http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/forestry/urban_forestry/arborday.pdf|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== McCreight and Theodore Roosevelt ===
Beginning in 1906, [[Pennsylvania]] conservationist [[Major Israel McCreight]] of [[DuBois, Pennsylvania]], argued that President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]’s conservation speeches were limited to businessmen in the lumber industry and recommended a campaign of youth education and a national policy on conservation education.&lt;ref&gt;M.I. McCreight, Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation Why: A Thirty-Four Year Moratorium on Unpublished Records (1940), Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania, at p.12, Hereinafter cited "Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation Why".&lt;/ref&gt; McCreight urged Roosevelt to make a public statement to school children about trees and the destruction of American forests.  Conservationist [[Gifford Pinchot]], Chief of the [[United States Forest Service]], embraced McCreight’s recommendations and asked the President to speak to the public school children of the United States about conservation. On April 15, 1907, Roosevelt issued an "Arbor Day Proclamation to the School Children of the United States"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oWgjAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=theodore%20roosevelt%20proclamation%20to%20school%20children%201906%201907&amp;pg=RA4-PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Arbor Day Proclamation to the School Children of the United States]&lt;/ref&gt; about the importance of trees and that forestry deserves to be taught in U.S. schools. Pinchot wrote McCreight, "we shall all be indebted to you for having made the suggestion."&lt;ref&gt;"Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation Why"&lt;/ref&gt;

The day was founded by Sir George W. Ross, later the Premier of Ontario, when he was Minister of Education in Ontario (1883-1899). According to the Ontario Teachers' Manuals "History of Education" (1915), Ross established both Arbour Day and Empire Day - "the former to give the school children an interest in making and keeping the school grounds attractive, and the latter to inspire the children with a spirit of patriotism" (p.&amp;nbsp;222). This predates the claimed founding of the day by Don Clark of Schomberg, Ontario for his wife Margret Clark in 1906. In Canada, [[National forest week|National Forest Week]] is the last full week of September, and National Tree Day (Maple Leaf Day) falls on the Wednesday of that week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianforestry.com/wp/national-forest-week/.

In 1929, the date for Arbor Day was changed to March 12 to commemorate [[Sun Yat-sen]]. In 1981, the fourth session of the Fifth [[National People's Congress]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] adopted the Resolution on the Unfolding of a Nationwide Voluntary Tree-planting Campaign. This resolution established the Arbor Day and stipulated that every able-bodied citizen between the ages of 11 and 60 should plant three to five trees per year or do the equivalent amount of work in seedling, cultivation, tree tending or other services. Supporting documentation instructs all units to report population statistics to the local afforestation committees as the basis for workload allocation.

===Netherlands===
Since conference and of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]'s publication ''[[World Festival of Trees]]'', and a resolution of the [[United Nations]] in 1954: "The Conference, recognising the need of arousing mass consciousness of the aesthetic, physical and economic value of trees, recommends a World Festival of Trees to be celebrated annually in each member country on a date suited to local conditions"; it has been adopted by the [[Netherlands]]. In 1957, the National Committee Day of Planting Trees/Foundation of National Festival of Trees (''Nationale Boomplantdag''/''Nationale Boomfeestdag'') was created.

On the third Wednesday in March each year (near the spring equinox), three quarters of Dutch schoolchildren aged 10/11 and Dutch celebrities plant trees. Stichting Nationale Boomfeestdag organizes all the activities in the Netherlands for this day. Some municipalities however plant the trees around 21 September because of the planting season.&lt;ref&gt;Boomfeestdag http://www.boomfeestdag.nl/ the organisations address is Spoorlaan 444 5038 CH TILBURG&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the 50th anniversary was celebrated with special golden jubilee activities.

=== New Zealand ===
[[New Zealand]]’s first Arbor Day planting was on 3 July 1890 at Greytown, in the Wairarapa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzarb.org.nz/Events/Conferences++Workshops/Arbor+Day+Planting.html|title=Arbor Day Planting {{!}} NZ Arb|website=www.nzarb.org.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first official celebration was scheduled to take place in [[Wellington]] in August 2012, with the planting of [[pohutukawa]] and [[Norfolk pines]] along Thorndon Esplanade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Prominent New Zealand botanist Dr [[Leonard Cockayne]] worked extensively on native plants throughout New Zealand and wrote many notable botanical texts. As early as the 1920s he held a vision for school students of New Zealand to be involved in planting native trees and plants in their school grounds. This vision bore fruit and schools in New Zealand have long planted native trees on Arbor Day.

Since 1977, New Zealand has celebrated Arbor Day on June 5, which is also [[World Environment Day]]. Prior to then, Arbor Day was celebrated on August 4, which is rather late in the year for tree planting in New Zealand, hence the date change.

Many of the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]]'s Arbor Day activities focus on ecological restoration projects using native plants to restore habitats that have been damaged or destroyed by humans or invasive pests and weeds. There are great restoration projects underway around New Zealand and many organisations including community groups, landowners, conservation organisations, [[iwi]], volunteers, schools, local businesses, nurseries and councils are involved in them. These projects are part of a vision to protect and restore the indigenous biodiversity.

[[File:Plantando encinas.jpg|thumb|Planting holm oaks in [[Pescueza]]]]
In Spain there is an [[International Forest Day]] on 21 March, but a decree in 1915 also brought in an Arbor Day throughout Spain. Each municipality or collective decides the date for its Arbor Day, usually between February and May. In [[Villanueva de la Sierra]] ([[Extremadura]]), where the first Arbor Day in the world was held in 1805, it is celebrated, as on that occasion, on Tuesday Carnaval. It is a great day in the local festive calendar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sierradegatadigital.es/articulo/cultura/villanueva-celebra-fiesta-medioambientalista-mas-antigua-mundo/20140225131113012653.html The oldest environmentalist festival in the world was celebrated in Villanueva].

Arbor Day (植樹節) has been a traditional [[Holidays in Taiwan|holiday]] in the [[Republic of China]] since 1927. In 1914, the founder of the [[Nanjing Agricultural University|agricultural college at Nanking University]] suggested to the now-defunct Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry that China should imitate the practice in the United States of Arbor Day. The holiday would be held the same day as the [[Qingming Festival]]. However, for unknown reasons, the suggestion was not made through the formal process, so nothing came from this original request. After the successful conclusion of the [[Northern Expedition]], the now-defunct Ministry of Agriculture and Minerals formally petitioned the [[Executive Yuan]] to establish Arbor Day to commemorate the passing of [[Sun Yat-sen|Dr. Sun Yat-sen]], the Father of Modern China. He had been a major advocate of afforestation in his life, because it would increase [[Three Principles of the People|people's livelihoods]]. The Executive Yuan approved Arbor Day in the spirit of Dr. Sun that year and has since been celebrated on March 12 for this purpose.

Arbor Day was founded in 1872 by [[Julius Sterling Morton|J. Sterling Morton]] in [[Nebraska City]], [[Nebraska]]. By the 1920s, each state in the [[United States]] had passed public laws that stipulated a certain day to be Arbor Day or ''Arbor and Bird Day'' observance.

National Arbor Day is celebrated every year on the last Friday in April; it is a [[civic holiday]] in [[Nebraska]]. Other [[U.S. state|states]] have selected their own dates for Arbor Day.

The customary observance is to plant a tree. On the first Arbor Day, April 10, 1872, an estimated one million trees were planted.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.arborday.org/arborday/history.cfm "The History of Arbor Day"] at the Arbor Day Foundation. Accessed on April 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Venezuela recognizes ''Día del Arbol'' (Day of the Tree) on the last Sunday of May.

:''For the later German touring car series, see [[ADAC Procar Series]].''
The '''BMW M1 Procar Championship''', sometimes known simply as '''Procar''', was a [[one-design|one-make]] [[auto racing]] series created by [[Jochen Neerpasch]],&lt;ref name="M1 Procar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qv500.com/bmwm1p3.php |title=BMW (E26) M1 Part 3: M1 Group 4 Procar Championship 1979&amp;nbsp;– 80 |publisher=QV500 |accessdate=2008-07-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514034348/http://www.qv500.com/bmwm1p3.php |archivedate=2008-05-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; head of [[BMW M|BMW Motorsport GmbH]], the racing division of automobile manufacturer [[BMW]].  The series pitted professional drivers from the [[Formula One|Formula One World Championship]], [[World Sportscar Championship]], [[European Touring Car Championship]], and other international series against one another using identically modified [[BMW M1]] [[sports car]]s.

Billed as an opportunity to see a mix of drivers from various motorsport disciplines,&lt;ref name="Revival"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2008/6/8013.html | title = Past masters to revive BMW M1 Procar at Hockenheim | publisher = [[Formula One Management]] | date = 2008-06-30 | accessdate = 2008-07-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080702183638/http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2008/6/8013.html| archivedate= 2 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the championship served as support races for various European rounds of the [[1979 Formula One season]], with Formula One drivers earning automatic entry into the Procar event based on their performance in their Formula One cars.&lt;ref name="M1 Procar" /&gt;  [[Austria]]n [[Niki Lauda]] won the inaugural championship.  In 1980, the series held some events outside of Formula One schedule, and was won by [[Brazil]]ian [[Nelson Piquet]].  BMW chose not to continue the championship in 1981 to concentrate on their entrance into Formula One.&lt;ref name="M1 Procar" /&gt;

==Origin==
:{{see also|BMW M1}}
[[Jochen Neerpasch]], the head of BMW's Motorsports division, was the first to propose the idea of a one-make championship.&lt;ref name="Revival" /&gt;  The division had started construction of the first sports car for BMW in 1978, the [[BMW M1|M1]], and had planned from the start to enter the new sports car in the [[World Sportscar Championship]] in 1979, as well as offering the cars to customers for other series.  BMW Motorsport planned to build M1s to meet regulations known as [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]], but a rule change instituted by the [[Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile]] (FISA) in 1977 altered the requirements for Group 5.  The new regulations required a minimum of 400 examples of the M1 to be built to meet [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] regulations before the car could be further [[homologation|homologated]] for the Group 5 category.&lt;ref name="M1 Group 4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qv500.com/bmwm1p2.php |title=BMW (E26) M1 Part 2: M1 Group 4 |publisher=QV500 |accessdate=2008-07-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419172703/http://www.qv500.com/bmwm1p2.php |archivedate=2008-04-19 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BMW M1 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The BMW M1 road car]]
Development of the Group 4 racing car was already under way at the time of the regulation change.  Neerpasch believed that rather than delaying their racing program until 400 road cars had been built, racing cars could be built at the same time since they too counted toward the 400 example minimum.  A [[One-design|one-make series]] consisting of the M1 racing cars intended for Group 4 was devised by Neerpasch since the racing cars could not yet legally compete elsewhere, while at the same time allowing BMW to develop the race cars through experience.&lt;ref name="Revival" /&gt;&lt;ref name="M1 Group 4" /&gt;

To attract drivers to the series, Neerpasch entered into discussions with [[Max Mosley]].  Mosley was the head of [[March Engineering]], a constructor which BMW was partnered with in their factory efforts in the [[Formula Two|European Formula Two Championship]].  Mosley was at the time a member of the [[Formula One Constructors Association]], and was able to use his position to convince other [[Formula One]] constructors to support the use of Neerpasch's one-make series as a support race for European [[Formula One]] events.&lt;ref name="M1 Procar" /&gt;  A ruling and organisation body for the series, known as The Procar Association, was set up by BMW and approved by FISA.&lt;ref name="British Grand Prix"&gt;{{cite book | title = Marlboro British Grand Prix Official Program | year = 1980 | pages = 6 | url = http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/Brands_Hatch-1980-07-13-photo.html | accessdate = 2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
With the Procar Championship announced in spring 1978 at the official unveiling of the M1 road car, Neerpasch and the newly formed Procar Association laid out regulations for the 1979 season.  Races were planned for the middle of the Formula One season, when the championship remained in Europe for several months.  Practice and qualifying were held on Friday of the race weekend, while the race itself occurred on Saturday.  The winner of each race received US&amp;nbsp;$5,000, second place received $3,000, and third place $1,000.&lt;ref name="M1 Procar" /&gt;  Races varied in length, but each lasted for approximately half an hour.&lt;ref name="British Grand Prix" /&gt;

To attract Formula One drivers to the championship, seats were guaranteed in the Procar races by cars which were entered by the factory BMW team.  The five fastest Formula One drivers from Friday practice were assigned to the factory team, and were even guaranteed the first five grid positions for the Procar race, regardless of their qualifying times in the cars.&lt;ref name="British Grand Prix" /&gt;  This not only guaranteed Formula One driver participation, but also allowed for a variety of drivers to be seen over the course of the season.  However, because the series ran [[Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tyres, several Formula One drivers were not allowed to compete due to [[contract|contractual obligations]] with competing tyre manufacturer [[Michelin]].&lt;ref name="M1 Procar" /&gt;  As [[Scuderia Ferrari]] and [[Renault F1|Renault]] were selling roadcars themselves, they did not allow their Formula One drivers to participate and implicitly endorse BMW.&lt;ref name="BMW Cars"&gt;{{cite book | title = BMW Cars | first = Martin | last = Buckley |author2=Nick Dimbleby | publisher = MotorBooks/MBI Publishing Company | year = 2002 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mo1tyh2HM18C | accessdate = 2008-08-19 | isbn = 0-7603-0921-3 | pages = 142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Remembering the Procar days |url=http://www.formula1.com/news/features/2004/7/1930.html |publisher=Formula One Management |work=Formula1.com |date=2004-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other teams were allowed to participate, assigning a variety of [[sports car racing|sportscar]] and [[touring car racing|touring car]] drivers as well as Formula One drivers who had not earned spots in the factory cars.  Points were awarded to the top ten finishers, starting with 20 points and decreasing down to 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, and finally 1 for the nine remaining drivers.  An overall championship was awarded to the driver who had accumulated the most points at the end of the season.&lt;ref name="British Grand Prix" /&gt;  A new M1 road car was awarded to the championship winner.&lt;ref name="Classic Driver"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.classicdriver.com/uk/magazine/3700.asp?id=13848 | title = Return of the BMW M1 Procars | publisher = Classic Driver | author = Charis Whitcombe | accessdate = 2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cars===
All cars used in the Procar Championship were built to identical standards, although their origins varied.  [[BS Fabrications]] constructed five cars for the [[BMW Motorsport|BMW factory team]], while cars for other competitors were constructed by the British Formula Two team [[Project Four Racing]] (led by [[Ron Dennis]]) and the Italian constructor [[Osella]].&lt;ref name="M1 Procar" /&gt;  The racing cars, designed to meet Group 4 technical regulations, shared only some basics from the M1 road cars.
[[File:BMW M1 Motor.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The engine bay of a Procar M1.  The M88/1 engine is a heavily tuned variant of the road car's [[BMW M88|M88]] [[straight-6]].]]
For the M1's exterior, simple modifications were made to adapt the car aerodynamically.  A deep [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] was added under the nose of the car, while an adjustable wing was added on two mounts at the rear of the engine cover.&lt;ref name="M1 Procar" /&gt;  The arches for the wheels were extended outward to shroud the wider {{convert|28|cm|in}} wheels in the front, and {{convert|32|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wheels at the rear.&lt;ref name="M1 Dimensions"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bmw.com/bmwhistory/com/en/1979/motorsport/media4/MSP_TW_79.pdf | title = BMW history&amp;nbsp;– BMW M1 ProCar | publisher = [[BMW]] | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-07-25 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110728042355/http://www.bmw.com/bmwhistory/com/en/1979/motorsport/media4/MSP_TW_79.pdf | archive-date = 2011-07-28 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The alloy wheels, designed by [[Campagnolo]], featured a central locking nut and mimicked the straked design of the production car's wheels.&lt;ref name="Original M-Series"&gt;{{cite book | title = Original BMW M-Series | last = Taylor | first = James | year = 2001 | accessdate = 2008-08-19 | publisher = MotorBooks/MBI International Company | isbn = 0-7603-0898-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=s5f34jrigrUC | pages = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inside, the car featured no finishing or luxuries from the road car, only a [[rollcage]] for driver protection.  The glass windows were replaced with clear plastic.&lt;ref name="M1 Procar" /&gt;

Mechanically, the Procar M1s were extensively modified to meet the requirements of circuit racing.  The standard M1 featured the cast iron block [[BMW M88]] [[straight-6]] with {{convert|3453|cc|cuin}} displacement.&lt;ref name="M1 Dimensions" /&gt;  Modified into the M88/1 by a team led by [[Paul Rosche]],&lt;ref name="Rosche"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bmw-sauber-f1.com/en/#/interactive/m1-revival/~2%7c0/ | title = Interactive.

The 5-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[gearbox]] housing from the road car was retained,&lt;ref name="M1 Dimensions" /&gt; but with multiple gear ratios allowed, as well as its own oil cooler.&lt;ref name="M1 Procar" /&gt;

The suspension was entirely new, adding adjustable [[anti-roll bar]]s.  The brakes were redesigned to adapt the use of a driver-adjustable brake pressure balance, while the [[Servomechanism|servo]]-activated braking system was removed.  A racing steering rack was used in place of the standard power steering unit.  Pneumatic jacks were later added to the cars in the 1980 season to allow for quicker [[pit stop]]s.  [[Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company|Goodyear]] racing tires were used on all cars.&lt;ref name="M1 Procar" /&gt;  All other non-essential items from the road car were not included, bringing the Procar M1's weight down to {{convert|1020|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name="M1 Dimensions" /&gt;  The performance of the Procar M1s was increased to a top speed of {{convert|311|km/h|mph}} dependent upon [[gear ratio]]s,&lt;ref name="M1 Dimensions" /&gt; and acceleration from 0–{{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 4.3&amp;nbsp;seconds.  Each Procar M1 cost approximately US&amp;nbsp;$60,000.&lt;ref name="M1 Procar" /&gt;

==Series history==

===1979 season===
[[File:BMW M1 Procar Cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Procar M1 driven by [[Clay Regazzoni]] for the [[BMW Motorsport]] team]]
An announced schedule for the inaugural season of the Procar Championship featured events taking place from May to September, when the Formula One World Championship ran eight consecutive [[List of Formula One Grands Prix|Grands Prix]] in Europe.  A ninth event was scheduled at [[Donington Park]] as part of the [[Gunnar Nilsson Memorial Trophy]], a charity event for the Gunnar Nilsson Cancer Fund, although it did not award points towards the overall championship.&lt;ref name="Gunnar Nilsson Trophy"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forix.com/8w/nilsson-trophy.html | title = The fan car raced twice! | publisher = Forix&amp;nbsp;– 8W | author = Mattijs Diepraam and Tom Prankerd |date=December 2000 | accessdate = 2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different Formula One drivers earned spots on the factory team over the season based on their performance in Formula One practice.  These included [[Mario Andretti]], [[Patrick Depailler]], [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], [[James Hunt]], [[Jean-Pierre Jarier]], [[Alan Jones (Formula 1)|Alan Jones]], [[Jacques Laffite]], [[Niki Lauda]], [[Nelson Piquet]], [[Didier Pironi]], [[Clay Regazzoni]], and [[John Watson (racing driver)|John Watson]].  [[Teo Fabi]], [[Tiff Needell]], [[Hans-Georg Bürger]] and [[Michael Bleekemolen]] were invited to drive in the factory BMW cars as well although they were not Formula One drivers at the time.&lt;ref name="1979 season"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qv500.com/bmwm1p379a.php |title=BMW M1 Procar 1979 Season |publisher=QV500 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720035021/http://www.qv500.com/bmwm1p379a.php |archivedate=2008-07-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the standard five car entry from BMW, several other notable teams participated.  Procar constructor Project Four entered a car for [[Niki Lauda]] when he was not in the factory entries, while Osella entered cars for a rotating driver line-up.  Touring car teams [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]], [[Eggenberger Motorsport|Eggenberger Racing]], Ecurie Arvor, and [[Schnitzer Motorsport]] entered cars, as did [[Konrad Motorsport|Team Konrad]] and GS Tuning from sports cars.&lt;ref name="1979 season" /&gt;

===1980 season===
[[File:Piquet BMW M1 Procar.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Procar BMW M1 driven by 1980 champion [[Nelson Piquet]]]]
For the second running of the Procar Championship, the schedule was altered and expanded so that the races did not rely exclusively on Formula One events.  This allowed the season to start slightly earlier, this time in April.  [[Donington Park]] was retained from the previous year but now counted towards the championship.  Two German events were added, with the Procar Championship designated as that year's [[Avusrennen]] at the [[AVUS]] circuit,&lt;ref name="Avus"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://theracingline.net/racingcircuits/racingcircuits/Germany/_gpAvusrennen.html | title = Avusrennen Winners | publisher = Motor Racing Circuits Database | accessdate = 2008-08-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724021134/http://theracingline.net/racingcircuits/racingcircuits/Germany/_gpAvusrennen.html | archive-date = 2011-07-24 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Procars serving as a support race for the [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft]]'s [[200 Miles of Norisring]].&lt;ref name="DRM"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wsrp.ic.cz/drm1980.html#7 | title = Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft 1980 | publisher = World Sports Racing Prototypes | date = 2008-04-15 | accessdate = 2008-08-15 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100125235816/http://wsrp.ic.cz/drm1980.html#7 | archivedate = 2010-01-25 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http://theracingline.net/racingcircuits/racingcircuits/_series/gt_bmw-procar/index.html"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://theracingline.net/racingcircuits/racingcircuits/_series/gt_bmw-procar/index.html | title = BMW M1 Procar Series 1980 Season | publisher = Motor Racing Circuits Database | accessdate = 2008-08-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120219195518/http://theracingline.net/racingcircuits/racingcircuits/_series/gt_bmw-procar/index.html | archive-date = 2012-02-19 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Six Formula One Grands Prix remained on the schedule.

Unlike the previous year where the fastest drivers in practice earned seats with the factory BMW team, five drivers were designated as the primary drivers for events which did not share a Grand Prix weekend.  These five were [[Alan Jones (Formula 1)|Alan Jones]], [[Jacques Laffite]], [[Nelson Piquet]], [[Didier Pironi]], and [[Carlos Reutemann]].  Other Formula One drivers to participate during Grands Prix were [[Mario Andretti]], [[Derek Daly]], [[Jean-Pierre Jarier]], [[Riccardo Patrese]], and [[Alain Prost]].&lt;ref name="1980 season"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qv500.com/bmwm1p380a.php |title=BMW M1 Procar 1980 Season |publisher=QV500 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720144740/http://www.qv500.com/bmwm1p380a.php |archivedate=2008-07-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several teams from the previous year entered once more, including Project Four, GS Tuning, Eggenberger Racing, Cassani Racing, and [[Schnitzer Motorsport]].  Newcomers included personal teams from [[Arturo Merzario]], [[Dieter Quester]], and [[Helmut Marko]], as well as Swiss sportscar manufacturer [[Sauber]].&lt;ref name="1980 season" /&gt;

==Afterwards==
At the start of the 1980 season, BMW announced their intention to enter Formula One as an engine supplier for [[Brabham]].&lt;ref name="BMW F1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bmw-motorsport.com/ms/en/fascination/history/f1/overview/index.html |title=F1 World Championship after 630 days |publisher=[[BMW Motorsport]] |accessdate=2008-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407221610/http://bmw-motorsport.com/ms/en/fascination/history/f1/overview/index.html |archivedate=2008-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The deal came in part due to [[Bernie Ecclestone]], then head of Brabham, as well as the head of [[BS Fabrications]], who had built several of the Procar M1s.  BMW planned to enter the series in 1982, and [[BMW Motorsport]] was tasked with concentrating their efforts on the new Formula One engines instead of the Procar series.&lt;ref name="BMW F1" /&gt;
[[File:1980-05-24 Nelson Piquet im BMW M1, Nürburgring Südkehre.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Group 4 M1 competing in the [[1000 km Nürburgring|1000&amp;nbsp;Kilometres of Nürburgring]].  Procar veterans [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]] and [[Nelson Piquet]] shared the car.]]
That same year, BMW officially met FISA's requirements by having built approximately 400 cars.  The M1 was therefore homologated for Group 4 on December 1, 1980, allowing BMW to enter the Championship for Makes in 1981.&lt;ref name="Group 4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qv500.com/bmwm1p5.php |title=BMW (E26) M1 Part 5: Group 4 World Manufacturers Championship |publisher=QV500 |accessdate=2008-07-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803213910/http://www.qv500.com/bmwm1p5.php |archivedate=2008-08-03 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As BMW shifted towards Formula One, the company ended their plans to enter the Group 5 category after the construction of only two race cars.&lt;ref name="Group 5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qv500.com/bmwm1p6.php |title=BMW (E26) M1 Part 6: M1 Group 5 'March' |publisher=QV500 |accessdate=2008-07-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803213551/http://www.qv500.com/bmwm1p6.php |archivedate=2008-08-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With BMW no longer needing to quickly build race cars, and with BMW Motorsport shifting to Formula One work, the series was not held in 1981.  The M1s used in the Procar series were sold to various customers for use in the World Championship, as well as smaller series such as the [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft]] and [[IMSA GT Championship|Camel GT Championship]].&lt;ref name="Group 4" /&gt;

In 1988, Motor Racing Developments, the owners of the Brabham Formula One Team, were sold to [[Alfa Romeo]].  Wishing to revive the Procar series, Brabham and Alfa Romeo developed a prototype racing car using a mid-mounted Formula One-based [[V10 engine]], covered in a bodywork silhouette mimicking the [[Alfa Romeo 164]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Frère|Frère, Paul]]. [[Road &amp; Track]]. New York: Aug. 1988 issue. Vol. 39, Iss. 12;  pg. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Alfa Romeo intended to use identical copies of the car for a resurrected Procar series, but the plans never came to fruition and only the prototype was built.&lt;ref name="164 Procar"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1205/Alfa-Romeo-164-ProCar.html | author = Wouter Melissen | title = 1988 Alfa Romeo 164 ProCar | publisher = Ultimate Car Pages | date = 2004-01-12 | accessdate = 2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival===
On June 30, 2008, BMW announced plans to revive the Procar series in an exhibition event at the [[2008 German Grand Prix]] at the [[Hockenheimring]].  The races involved ten original M1 Procars driven by several drivers who had participated in the original series as well as modern drivers.&lt;ref name="Revival" /&gt;  Each car included a passenger seat for a guest.&lt;ref name="Revival Speedhunters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speedhunters.com/archive/2008/07/20/event-gt-gt-bmw-m1-30th-anniversary-race.aspx |title=BMW M1 30th ANNIVERSARY RACE |publisher=Speedhunters |date=2008-07-20 |accessdate=2008-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716114730/http://speedhunters.com/archive/2008/07/20/event-gt-gt-bmw-m1-30th-anniversary-race.aspx |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The line-up included former competitors [[Christian Danner]], [[Harald Grohs]], [[Niki Lauda]], [[Dieter Quester]], and [[Marc Surer]].  Former BMW driver [[Prince Leopold of Bavaria (b. 1943)|Prince Leopold of Bavaria]], [[BMW Sauber]] test driver [[Christian Klien]], and a current M1 Procar owner, Marco Wagner, also competed.  The BMW M1 [[Art Car]] designed by [[Andy Warhol]] was involved, driven by series founder Jochen Neerpasch and with fellow [[Art Car]] artist [[Frank Stella]] as his passenger.&lt;ref name="Revival Results"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2008/7/8115.html | title = Lauda wins first BMW M1 Procar Revival race | publisher = [[Formula One Management]] | date = 2008-07-19 | accessdate = 2008-07-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080724120443/http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2008/7/8115.html| archivedate= 24 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Beaux Arts Ball''' (in French the '''Bal des Quatres Arts''') is the annual [[costume ball]] traditionally given by the students of the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris in the spring, in the École building on the rue Bonaparte overlooking the [[Seine]]. Elaborately allegorical floats circled the room at midnight and were judged by a panel. "It is a riot, a revival of paganism, known elsewhere only in Italy.  It is also, in its way, a hymn to beauty, a living explosion of the senses and the emotions," wrote E. Berry Wall in ''Neither Pest Nor Puritan.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downtownartsclub.com/BAB/history.htm On-line quote] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107005331/http://www.downtownartsclub.com/BAB/history.htm |date=2009-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its reputation for fabulously designed nudity, ''louche'' antics, [[cross-dressing]] and high style encouraged imitators in American cities. In 1931, in New York, famous architects dressed up as their buildings and today, many American architecture schools hold similar costume balls.{{cn|date=November 2014}}

Reference to the Beaux-Arts Ball is made in the verse of the popular [[Rodgers and Hart]] song "[[The Lady Is A Tramp]]" from ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2657">'''Bernardo Bellincioni''' (1452–1492) was an [[Italian poet]], who began his career in the court of [[Lorenzo the Magnificent]] in [[Florence]]. In 1483 he was at the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] court and in 1485 he moved to [[Milan]], where he was the [[court poet]] of [[Ludovico Sforza]], the patron of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. He wrote [[Eulogy|eulogistic]] [[sonnet]]s addressed to his patrons and engaged in the usual literary squabbles with other poets, some in the burlesque manner established by [[Domenico Burchiello]], that are a characteristic of the [[Italian Renaissance]].

Bellincioni's [[occasional verse]] provided the literary clues to elaborate [[Allegory|allegorical]] [[masque]]s and [[Royal entry|state entries]] that were highlights of Early Modern court life. On the occasion of the marriage of the heir of Milan [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza]]&lt;ref&gt;Ludovico acted as regent and assumed all real power.&lt;/ref&gt; to his cousin [[Isabella of Aragon, Duchess of Milan|Isabella of Aragon]], daughter of the [[Alfonso II of Naples|King of Naples]], [[Apollo]] presented the poems that had accompanied the tableaux in a little book (''[[libretto]]'') of fine [[calligraphy]] to the nineteen-year-old Isabella.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Webb, Peter Elmer, Roberta Wood, ''The Renaissance in Europe: An Anthology'' (Yale University Press) 2000:224&lt;/ref&gt;

He composed an effusive ode to [[Cecilia Gallerani]], the ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' in her portrait by Leonardo, "the envy of Nature",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted and translated by Frank Zöllner, "Leonardo da Vinci's Portraits: Ginevra de' Benci, Cecilia Gallerani, La Belle Ferronière, and Mona Lisa", in ''Rafael i jego spadkobiercy. Portret klasyczny w sztuce nowozytnej Europy ; materialy ses-ji naukowej,'' 24–25 October 2002. (Toruń: Nicholas Copernicus University) 2003 (Sztuka i kultura) '''4''' pp 157-183; ([http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/volltexte/2006/169/pdf/Zoellner_Raffael_03.pdf. on-line text])&lt;/ref&gt; which has permitted the identification of the sitter: "She seems to listen and not talk."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1254">'''Camden Festival''' was an annual spring festival founded in 1954 and held in [[London]], England.  Originally, it was named the '''St Pancras Festival''' until 1965. It continued until 1987.

The festival specialised in the revival of long-forgotten operas, some of which subsequently made their way back into the repertory. Performances were given at St Pancras Town Hall until 1969, and thereafter at the Bloomsbury Theatre (formerly [[Collegiate Theatre]]). 

Among now well-known singers who appeared in the Festival was the young [[Kiri Te Kanawa]] who sang Elena in Rossini's ''[[La donna del lago]]'' in 1969 prior to joining the [[Covent Garden]] Opera in 1970.

The Camden Festival was superseded by the Bloomsbury Festival in 1988.  Today, the festival consists of  a very broad range of cultural events, as evidenced by its 2013 program, and opera appears as only a very small part of its programming.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4335">The '''chronovisor''' was allegedly a functional [[time viewer]] described by [[Father François Brune]] in his 2002 book ''Le nouveau mystère du Vatican'' ("The Vatican’s New Mystery"). Brune is the author of several books on the [[paranormal]] and religion.

In the book, Brune relates that the chronovisor was built by Pellegrino Ernetti (1925&amp;ndash;1994), an Italian priest and scientist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Brune |first = François |authorlink = Father François Brune |title = Le nouveau mystère du Vatican |publisher = Albin Michel |year = 2002 |location = |pages = |isbn = 978-2-226-13070-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ernetti was a real person, the existence or functionality of the chronovisor has never been confirmed; its alleged capabilities are strongly reminiscent of the fictional time viewer which features in [[T. L. Sherred]]'s 1947 science fiction novella, ''[[E for Effort]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Krassa | first = Peter | title = Father Ernetti's Chronovisor: The Creation and Disappearance of the World's First Time Machine | publisher = New Paradigm Books | location = Pasadena, CA | year = 2000 | |origyear=1997 | |oclc=43671848 | isbn = 1-892138-02-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In the early 1960s, Ernetti began to study the writings of François Brune, himself a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] and author. Ernetti allegedly ended up helping Brune construct the machine as members of a team which included twelve world-famous scientists. He identified two of them as [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Wernher von Braun]]. The chronovisor was described as a large cabinet with a [[cathode ray tube]] for viewing the received events and a series of buttons, levers, and other controls for selecting the time and the location to be viewed. It could also locate and track specific individuals. According to its inventor, it worked by receiving, decoding and reproducing the [[electromagnetic radiation]] left behind from past events. It could also pick up the audio component or [[sound wave]]s emitted by these same events.  

Ernetti lacked hard evidence for these claims. He said that he had observed, among other historical events, [[Christ]]'s [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and photographed it as well. A copy of this image, Ernetti said, appeared in the 2 May 1972 issue of ''[[La Domenica del Corriere]]'', an [[Italy|Italian]] weekly [[news magazine]]. A near-identical (mirror-image) photograph, however, of a wood carving by the sculptor [[Lorenzo Coullaut Valera]] turned up and succeeded in casting doubt upon Ernetti's statement.

Using the chronovisor, Ernetti said that he had witnessed, among other scenes, a performance in [[Rome]] in 169 BC of the lost tragedy, ''[[Thyestes (Euripides)|Thyestes]]'', by the father of [[Latin]] poetry, [[Quintus Ennius]]. Dr. Katherine Eldred of [[Princeton University]] is the author of an English rendition of the text which is included as an appendix to the U.S. printing of Peter Krassa's book on the Chronovisor (see below). Eldred believes that Ernetti actually wrote the supposedly ancient play himself. As provided by an anonymous relative of Father Ernetti, there was a deathbed confession, included in the U.S. edition of the play, that Ernetti had written the text of the play himself and that the "photo" of Christ was indeed a "lie". According to the same "source", however, Ernetti also affirmed that the machine was genuinely functional.

Brune, however, does not believe Ernetti's "confession" and is convinced that the authorities had coerced Ernetti into making a [[false confession]]. 

The alleged existence of the chronovisor has fueled a whole series of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]],{{Who|date=December 2009}} such as that the device was seized and is actually used by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] or by those who secretly control governments and their economies all around the world.

'''Classic Gaming Expo''' was a [[gaming convention]] dedicated to the people, systems and games of yesteryear, with an emphasis on historic [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classic Gaming Expo 2003|url=http://www.dickestel.com/classicexpo.htm |publisher=Dick Estel's World |accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Expo was founded in 1999 by John Hardie, Sean Kelly and Keita Iida, In 2000, Joe Santulli replaced Iida as the show's co-organizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=J.C.

The conventions have typically been held in the [[Las Vegas Valley]], [[Nevada]], but have sometimes been held in [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classic Gaming Expo 2004 |url=http://www.dickestel.com/classicexpo2004.htm|publisher=Dick Estel's World |accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the expo, Kelly, Hardie and Santulli founded the [[Videogame History Museum]], a traveling museum of classic video games and equipment that on display at events like [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)]] and [[Game Developers Conference|GDC (Game Developers Conference)]]. In April 2016. the traveling museum celebrated the building of a permanent facility known as the National Videogame Museum [[National Videogame Museum]] in [[Frisco, Texas]].  Currently, one of the founding members, John Hardie. is the residing curator onsite. 

== History ==
In October 1995, videogame collectors John Hardie, Keita Iida and Mike Etler, founded NAVA (North Atlantic  Videogame Aficionados), at Etler's Howell, NJ videogame store, Video Game Connections. The purpose of the quarterly event was to provide a meeting place where videogame collectors could get together and discuss videogame collecting as well as a place to buy, sell and trade games. The group was a hit and attracted videogame collectors from all around the Northeast from Canada to South Carolina.

In 1998 Hardie and Iida decided to bring NAVA to the national level. They teamed up with Richard Tsukiji to include classic gaming memorabilia to Tsukiji's annual World of Atari show. The show was held in Las Vegas at the Holiday Inn Boardwalk Hotel and Casino on August 21–23, 1998. The event was such a success that Hardie and Iida decided to break away from World of Atari and, along with Sean Kelly, created their own show, Classic Gaming Expo.

Classic Gaming Expo has been held at the following dates and places:
*	1999 – August 14–15 – Las Vegas – Plaza Hotel
*	2000 – July 29–30 – Las Vegas – Plaza Hotel
*	2001 – August 11–12 – Las Vegas – Plaza Hotel &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Edward Burns|title=CGE 2001 Video Montage|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbNmsda25RI|publisher=Edward Burns|accessdate=9 June 2017|location=Technology: Circuits|date=August 11, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Croatian War of Independence}}

The '''Croatian War of Independence''' was fought from 1991 to 1995 between [[Croats|Croat]] forces loyal to the government of [[Croatia]]—which had declared independence from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY)—and the [[Serb]]-controlled [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) and [[Serbs of Croatia|local Serb]] forces, with the JNA ending its combat operations in Croatia by 1992. In Croatia, the war is primarily referred to as the "Homeland War" (''{{lang|hr|Domovinski rat}}'') and also as the "Greater-Serbian Aggression" (''{{lang|hr|Velikosrpska agresija}}'').&lt;ref name="Darko Zubrinic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRV-name-VSA-Bilandžija"/&gt; In Serbian sources, "War in Croatia" (Рат у Хрватској / ''Rat u Hrvatskoj'') and "War in Krajina" (Рат у Крајини / ''Rat u Krajini'') are used.&lt;ref name="B92-RUH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Srbija-Hrvatska, temelj stabilnosti |trans-title=Serbia-Croatia, foundation of stability |language=Serbian |url=http://www.b92.net/info/emisije/kaziprst.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=11&amp;nav_id=470273 |publisher=[[B92]] |date=4 November 2010 |accessdate=22 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108200243/http://www.b92.net/info/emisije/kaziprst.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=11&amp;nav_id=470273 |archivedate=November 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of Croats wanted Croatia to leave Yugoslavia and become a sovereign country, while many ethnic Serbs living in Croatia, supported by [[Republic of Serbia (1992–2006)|Serbia]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Martić Verdict|Martić verdict]], pp.&amp;nbsp;122–123&lt;br /&gt;"The Trial Chamber found that the evidence showed that the [[President of Serbia|President]] of Serbia, [[Slobodan Milošević]], openly supported the preservation of Yugoslavia as a federation of which the SAO Krajina would form a part.

This state was to be created through the establishment of paramilitary forces and the provocation of incidents in order to create a situation where the JNA could intervene.

The JNA initially tried to keep Croatia within Yugoslavia by occupying all of Croatia.&lt;ref name="Kadijević134-135"&gt;[[#Kadijević|Kadijević (1993)]], pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bjelajac et al.|2009|p=241}}  After this failed, Serb forces established the self-proclaimed [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) within Croatia.

During that time, the RSK encompassed {{convert|13913|km2|sp=us}}, more than a quarter of Croatia.&lt;ref name="Profil-RSK-Dokumenti"/&gt; In 1995, Croatia launched two major offensives known as [[Operation Flash]] and [[Operation Storm]],&lt;ref name="LATimes-Storm-Complete"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Flash-May2"/&gt; which would effectively end the war in its favor. The remaining [[United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium]] (UNTAES) zone was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia by 1998.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-ErdutAgr-12Nov95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-UNTAES-16Jan98"/&gt;

The war ended with Croatian victory, as it achieved the goals it had declared at the beginning of the war: independence and preservation of its borders.&lt;ref name="LATimes-Storm-Complete"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-ErdutAgr-12Nov95"/&gt; Approximately 21–25% of Croatia's economy was ruined, with an estimated US$37&amp;nbsp;billion in damaged infrastructure, lost [[Output (economics)|output]], and refugee-related costs.&lt;ref name="Europe-Review-2003"/&gt; Over 20,000 people were killed in the war,&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; and refugees were displaced on both sides. The Serb and Croatian governments began to progressively cooperate with each other but tensions remain, in part due to verdicts by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) and [[Croatia–Serbia genocide case|lawsuits filed by each country against the other]].&lt;ref name="UNHCR-Croatia-Serbia-Refugees2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-Josipović-Belgrade-2010"/&gt;

In 2007, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) returned a guilty verdict against [[Milan Martić]], one of the Serb leaders in Croatia, for having colluded with [[Slobodan Milošević]] and others to create a "unified Serbian state".&lt;ref name="icty martic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Milan Martić sentenced to 35 years for crimes against humanity and war crimes|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/8870|publisher=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|date=12 June 2007|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2008 and 2012, the ICTY had prosecuted Croatian generals [[Ante Gotovina]], [[Mladen Markač]] and [[Ivan Čermak]] for alleged involvement in the crimes related to [[Operation Storm]].

==Background==
{{See also|Breakup of Yugoslavia|Independence of Croatia}}

===Political changes in Yugoslavia===
Since the 1970s, Yugoslavia's [[Communist regime]] became severely splintered into a liberal-decentralist nationalist faction led by Croatia and Slovenia that supported a decentralized federation to give greater autonomy to Croatia and Slovenia, versus a conservative-centralist nationalist faction led by Serbia that supported a centralized federation to secure Serbia's and the Serbs' interests across Yugoslavia – as they were the largest ethnic group in the country as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Nations: Europe. Gale Group, 2001. Pp. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Croatian Spring|1967 to 1972 in Croatia]] and [[1968 protests in Kosovo|1968]] and [[1981 protests in Kosovo]], nationalist doctrines and actions caused ethnic tensions that destabilized Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Jović|2009|p=19}} The suppression by the state of nationalists is believed to have had the effect of identifying [[Croat nationalism]] as the primary alternative to [[communism]] itself and made it a strong underground movement.{{sfn|Jović|2009|p=21}}

A crisis emerged in Yugoslavia with the [[Revolutions of 1989|weakening]] of the [[Eastern Bloc|Communist states in Eastern Europe]] towards the end of the [[Cold War]], as symbolized by the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|fall]] of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989. In Croatia, the regional branch of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]], the [[League of Communists of Croatia]], had lost its ideological potency.{{sfn|Pešić|1996|p=12}}&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Kosovo-Repression"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/serbia/kosovo/index.html|title=Kosovo|date=23 July 2010|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] and [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]] wanted to move towards [[decentralization]].&lt;ref name="NYT-Croatia-Prosperity-1985"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/08/world/yugoslav-republic-jealously-guards-its-gains.html?ref=croatia|title=Yugoslav republic jealously guards its gains|author=Henry Kamm|authorlink=Henry Kamm|date=8 December 1985|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SR Serbia]], headed by [[Slobodan Milošević]], adhered to centralism and single-party rule, and in turn effectively ended the autonomy of the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and [[SAP Vojvodina|Vojvodina]] by March 1989, taking command of their votes in the [[Yugoslav Presidency|Yugoslav federal presidency]].&lt;ref name="Annex IV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Kosovo-Repression"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RFERL-Vojvodina-Autonomy"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Serbias_Vojvodina_Regains_Autonomy/1904999.html|title=Serbia's Vojvodina Regains Autonomy|date=15 December 2009|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Country Study: Yugoslavia (Former): Political Innovation and the 1974 Constitution (chapter 4)|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/yutoc.html#yu0130|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nationalist ideas started to grow within the ranks of the still-ruling League of Communists, while Milošević's speeches, notably the 1989 [[Gazimestan speech]] in which he talked of "battles of quarrels", favored continuation of a unified Yugoslav state — one in which all power would continue to be centralized in [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref name="Annex IV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown116"&gt;[[#Brown &amp; Karim|Brown &amp; Karim (1995)]], p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian-Gazimestan"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/01/balkans.warcrimes|title=Tyrant's defeat marks Serbs' day of destiny|author=Tim Judah|authorlink=Tim Judah|date=1 July 2001|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1989, the Serbian government pressured the Croatian government to allow a series of Serb nationalist rallies in the country, and the Serbian media and various Serbian intellectuals had already begun to refer to the Croatian leadership as "[[Ustaše]]", and began to make reference to crimes committed by the [[Ustaše]] between 1941-45. The rhetoric was approved by the Serbian political leadership, and accused the Croatian leadership of being "blindly nationalistic" when it objected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glaurdić|first=Josip|title=The Hour of Europe: Western Powers and the Breakup of Yugoslavia|year=2011|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-16645-3|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having completed the [[anti-bureaucratic revolution]] in [[Vojvodina]], Kosovo, and Montenegro, Serbia secured four out of eight federal presidency votes in 1991,&lt;ref name="Brown116"/&gt; which rendered the governing body ineffective as other republics objected and called for reform of the Federation.&lt;ref name="Frucht433"&gt;[[#Frucht|Frucht (2005)]], p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1989, political parties were allowed and a number of them had been founded, including the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska demokratska zajednica}}) (HDZ), led by [[Franjo Tuđman]], who later became the first [[president of Croatia]].&lt;ref name="Independent-Tuđman-Obituary"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-franjo-tudjman-1132142.html |title=Obituary: Franjo Tudjman |author=Branka Magas |date=13 December 1999 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |archivedate=July 25, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69Qmjvz7e?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-franjo-tudjman-1132142.html |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1990, the League of Communists broke up on ethnic lines, with the Croatian and Slovene factions demanding a looser federation at the 14th Extraordinary Congress. At the congress, Serbian delegates accused the Croatian and Slovene delegates of "supporting separatism, terrorism and genocide in Kosovo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glaurdić|first=Josip|title=The Hour of Europe: Western Powers and the Breakup of Yugoslavia|year=2011|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-16645-3|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian and Slovene delegations, including most of their ethnic Serb members, eventually left in protest, after Serbian delegates rejected every proposed amendment.&lt;ref name="Brown116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LondonTimes-Račan-Obituary"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Times]]|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1722946.ece|title=Račan obituary|date=30 April 2007|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

January 1990 also marked the beginning of court cases being brought to Yugoslavia's Constitutional Court on the matter of secession.&lt;ref name="Igor Primoratz 2006. p158"&gt;Igor Primoratz, Aleksandar Pavković. ''Identity, Self-determination and Secession''.

''Identity, Self-determination and Secession''.

The [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|first free elections in Croatia]] and Slovenia were scheduled for a few months later.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Elections1-HRV1990"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/23/world/evolution-in-europe-yugoslavia-hopes-for-free-vote-in-90.html?ref=croatia|title=Evolution in Europe; Yugoslavia Hopes for Free Vote in '90|date=23 April 1990|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first round of elections in Croatia were held on 22 April, and the second round on 6 May.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Elections2-HRV1990"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/09/world/evolution-in-europe-conservatives-win-in-croatia.html?ref=croatia|title=Evolution in Europe; Conservatives Win in Croatia|date=9 May 1990|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HDZ based its campaign on greater sovereignty (eventually outright independence) for Croatia, fueling a sentiment among Croats that "only the HDZ could protect Croatia from the aspirations of Milošević towards a Greater Serbia". It topped the poll in the elections (followed by [[Ivica Račan]]'s reformed communists, [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]]) and was set to form a new [[Croatian Government]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Elections2-HRV1990"/&gt;

A tense atmosphere prevailed on  May 13, 1990, when a [[Dinamo Zagreb-Red Star Belgrade riot|football game was held at Zagreb]] in [[Maksimir Stadium]] between [[Zagreb]]'s [[Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo]] team and Belgrade's [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]]. The game erupted into violence between the Croatian and Serbian fans and between the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dalje.com/en-sports/video--day-when-maksimir-stadium-went-up-in-flames/257791|title=The Day When Maksimir Stadium Went up in Flames|publisher=Dalje.com|date=13 May 2009|accessdate=19 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508154538/http://dalje.com/en-sports/video--day-when-maksimir-stadium-went-up-in-flames/257791|archivedate=May 8, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May 1990, the new [[Croatian Parliament]] held its first session. President Tuđman announced his manifesto for a new Constitution (ratified at the end of the year) and a multitude of political, economic, and social changes, notably to what extent minority rights (mainly for Serbs) would be guaranteed. Local Serb politicians opposed the new constitution. In 1991, Croats represented 78.1% and Serbs 12.2% of the total population of Croatia,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Milošević Indictment|Milošević indictment]], p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; but the latter held a disproportionate number of official posts: 17.7% of appointed officials in Croatia, including police, were Serbs. An even greater proportion of those posts had been held by Serbs in Croatia earlier, which created a perception that the Serbs were guardians of the communist regime.{{sfn|Bjelajac et al.|2009|p=239}} This caused discontent among the Croats despite the fact it never actually undermined their own dominance in SR Croatia.{{sfn|Pešić|1996|p=12}} After the HDZ came to power, many Serbs employed in the public sector, especially the police, were fired and replaced by Croats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/143561/Croatia/223957/Croatia-in-Yugoslavia-1945-91?anchor=ref476690|title=Croatia in Yugoslavia, 1945–91|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with Tuđman's remarks, i.e. "they declare that my wife is Jewish or Serbian.

In one instance, TV Belgrade showed Tuđman shaking hands with German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] (who would be the first government leader in the world to recognise independent Croatia and Slovenia) accusing the two of plotting "a Fourth Reich".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/01/magazine/carving-out-a-greater-serbia.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=Carving out a Greater Serbia|author=Stephen Engelberg|work=The New York Times|date=1 September 1991|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown &amp; Karim|Brown &amp; Karim (1995)]], p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 1990|Slovenian parliamentary election]] and the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|Croatian parliamentary election]] in April and May 1990, the JNA announced that the [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]-era doctrine of "general people's defense", in which each republic maintained a [[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial defense force]] ({{lang-sh|Teritorijalna obrana}}) (TO), would henceforth be replaced by a centrally directed system of defense. The republics would lose their role in defense matters and their TOs would be disarmed and subordinated to JNA headquarters in Belgrade, but the new Slovenian government acted quickly to retain control over their TO.&lt;ref name="Slovenian-Army-TO1990"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Slovenian Armed Forces]]|url=http://www.slovenskavojska.si/en/about-the-slovenian-armed-forces/history|title=History—Territorial Defence|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 1990, the weapons of the TO of Croatia, in Croat-majority regions, were taken away by the JNA,{{sfn|Kreš|2010|p=54}} preventing the possibility of Croatia having its own weapons as was done in Slovenia.{{sfn|Kreš|2010|p=6}}
.{{sfn|Bjelajac et al.|2009|pp=237, 240}} [[Borisav Jović]], Serbia's representative in the Federal Presidency and a close ally of Slobodan Milošević, claimed that this action came at the behest of Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glaurdić|first=Josip|title=The Hour of Europe: Western Powers and the Breakup of Yugoslavia|year=2011|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-16645-3|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jović, on 27 June 1990 he and [[Veljko Kadijević]], the Yugoslav Defence Minister, met and agreed that they should, regarding Croatia and Slovenia, "expel them forcibly from Yugoslavia, by simply drawing borders and declaring that they have brought this upon themselves through their decisions". According to Jović, the next day he obtained the agreement of Milošević.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jović|first=Borisav|title=Poslednji dani SFRJ|year=1995|publisher=Politika|location=Belgrade|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kadijević, of mixed Serb-Croat heritage and a [[Yugoslav Partisan]] in [[World War II]], was loyal to Yugoslavia and not a Greater Serbia; Kadijević believed that if Slovenia left Yugoslavia the state would collapse and thus he discussed with Jović about possibly using the JNA to impose [[martial law]] in Slovenia to prevent this potential collapse and was willing to wage war with the secessionist republics to prevent their secession.&lt;ref&gt;Adam LeBor. Milosevic: A Biography. London, UK: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2003{{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadijević considered the political crisis and ethnic conflict to have been caused by the actions of foreign governments, particularly Germany, which he accused of seeking to break up Yugoslavia to allow Germany to exercise a sphere of influence in the Balkans.&lt;ref name="Sabrina P.

After the election of Tuđman and the HDZ, a Serb Assembly was established in [[Srb]], north of Knin, on 25 July 1990 as the political representation of the Serb people in Croatia. The Serb Assembly declared "sovereignty and autonomy of the Serb people in Croatia".&lt;ref name="icty babic2"&gt;[[#Martić Verdict|Martić verdict]], pp&amp;nbsp;44–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1990, an unrecognized [[mono-ethnic]] referendum was held in regions with a substantial Serb population which would later become known as the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) (bordering western [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) on the question of Serb "sovereignty and autonomy" in Croatia.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Minority-AUG1990"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/07/world/serb-minority-seek-role-in-a-separate-croatia.html?ref=croatia|author=Chuck Sudetic|authorlink=Chuck Sudetic|title=Serb Minority Seek Role in a Separate Croatia|date=7 August 1990|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an attempt to counter changes made to the constitution. The Croatian government sent police forces to police stations in Serb-populated areas to seize their weapons. Among other incidents, local Serbs from the southern hinterlands of Croatia, mostly around the city of [[Knin]], blocked roads to tourist destinations in Dalmatia. This incident is known as the "[[Log Revolution]]".&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Log-19AUG1990"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/19/world/roads-sealed-as-yugoslav-unrest-mounts.html?ref=croatia|agency=[[Reuters]]|title=Roads Sealed as Yugoslav Unrest Mounts|date=19 August 1990|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Log-20AUG1990"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/20/world/armed-serbs-guard-highways-in-croatia-during-referendum.html?ref=croatia|title=Armed Serbs Guard Highways in Croatia During Referendum|date=20 August 1990|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, during Martić's trial, Babić claimed he was tricked by Martić into agreeing to the Log Revolution, and that it and the entire war in Croatia was Martić's responsibility, and had been orchestrated by Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=tri&amp;s=f&amp;o=259675&amp;apc_state=henftri259753|title=IWPR news report: Martic "Provoked" Croatian Conflict|work=iwpr.net|publisher=[[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]]|date=17 February 2006|accessdate=7 February 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103034/http://www.iwpr.net/?p=tri&amp;s=f&amp;o=259675&amp;apc_state=henftri259753|archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was corroborated by Martić in an interview published in 1991.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-MarticInterview-19AUG1991"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/20/world/truce-in-croatia-on-edge-of-collapse.html?ref=croatia|title=Truce in Croatia on Edge of Collapse|author=Chuck Sudetic|authorlink=Chuck Sudetic|date=19 August 1991|accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babić confirmed that by July 1991 Milošević had taken over control of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA).&lt;ref name="Babic transcript"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/martic/trans/en/060217IT.htm|title=Milan Babić Transcript|publisher=[[ICTY]]|date=17 February 2006|accessdate=10 January 2011|pages=1504–1510}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian government responded to the blockade of roads by sending special police teams in helicopters to the scene, but were intercepted by [[SFR Yugoslav Air Force]] fighter jets and forced to turn back to [[Zagreb]]. The Serbs felled pine trees or used bulldozers to block roads to seal off towns like Knin and [[Benkovac]] near the [[Adriatic coast]]. On 18 August 1990, the Serbian newspaper ''[[Večernje novosti]]'' claimed almost "two million Serbs were ready to go to Croatia to fight".&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Log-19AUG1990"/&gt;

On 21 December 1990, the [[SAO Krajina]] was proclaimed by the municipalities of the regions of Northern [[Dalmatia]] and [[Lika]], in south-western Croatia. Article 1 of the Statute of the SAO Krajina defined the SAO Krajina as "a form of territorial autonomy within the Republic of Croatia" in which the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia, state laws, and the Statute of the SAO Krajina were applied.&lt;ref name="icty babic2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/02/world/croatia-s-serbs-declare-their-autonomy.html |author=Chuck Sudetic |title=Croatia's Serbs Declare Their Autonomy |date=2 October 1990 |accessdate=11 December 2010 |archivedate=July 25, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69Qmswhv4?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/02/world/croatia-s-serbs-declare-their-autonomy.html |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 1990, the Parliament of Croatia ratified the new constitution,&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Constitution-HRV1990"/&gt; which was seen by Serbs as taking away rights that had been granted by the Socialist constitution.{{sfn|Pešić|1996|p=10&amp;ndash;11|ps=[The nations'] rights to be "constitutive" were recognized not only within their respective states, but also among co-nationals inhabiting the territory of other Yugoslav republics. In some cases, these ethnic diaspora communities viewed the constitutive nature of Yugoslav nationhood as giving them the right to extend the sovereignty of their national "homeland" to the territories they inhabited. Such was the case with Serbs in Croatia, who constituted 12% of the population in 1991. Later, this status would produce enormous problems, giving Croatian Serbs the "right" to secede from Croatia, and giving Croatia the right to deny them this status by designating them as a "minority" in its new constitution.}} The constitution did define Croatia as "the national state of the Croatian nation and a state of members of other nations and minorities who are its citizens: Serbs&amp;nbsp;... who are guaranteed [[Social equality|equality]] with citizens of Croatian nationality&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="icty babic2"/&gt;

After it was discovered that [[Martin Špegelj]] had pursued a campaign to acquire arms through the black market in January 1991 an ultimatum was issued requesting disarming and disbanding of Croatian military forces considered illegal by the Yugoslav authorities.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Disarming-TO1991"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/20/world/defiant-yugoslav-republics-brace-for-assault.html?ref=croatia|title=Defiant Yugoslav Republics Brace for Assault|agency=Associated Press|date=20 January 1991|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Clarification-TO1991"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/22/world/yugoslavia-warns-croatia-to-disarm-its-forces.html?ref=croatia|author=Chuck Sudetic|title=Yugoslavia Warns Croatia to Disarm Its Forces|date=22  January 1991|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatian authorities refused to comply, and the Yugoslav army withdrew the ultimatum six days after it was issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/25/world/defiant-croatian-republic-refuses-to-disarm-paramilitary-police.html?ref=croatia|author= Chuck Sudetic|title=Defiant Croatian Republic Refuses to Disarm Paramilitary Police|date=25 January 1991|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/27/world/confrontation-in-yugoslavia-headed-off.html?ref=croatia|title=Confrontation in Yugoslavia Headed Off|author=Chuck Sudetic|date=27 January 1991|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 1991, the leadership of the Army met with the [[Presidency of the SFRY]] in an attempt to convince them to declare a [[state of emergency]] which would allow for the army to take control of the country. Yugoslav army chief [[Veljko Kadijević]] declared that there was a conspiracy to destroy the country, saying:
{{quote|An insidious plan has been drawn up to destroy Yugoslavia. Stage one is civil war. Stage two is foreign intervention.

British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jović claims that Kadijević and the Army in March 1991 supported a [[coup d'etat]] as a way out of the crisis but then changed their minds four days later.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{YouTube|KfHdTbTkTiY|RTS interview with Veljko Kadijević, November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadijević's response to this was that "Jović is lying".&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; Kadijević claims that a March 1991 meeting two days after the [[March 9, 1991 protest|huge protests organized by Vuk Drašković on the streets of Belgrade]] in Jović's office to which Kadijević had been invited by Milošević where, according to Kadijević, Milošević requested that the army take control of the country through a military coup.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; Kadijević's apparent response was informing Milošević that he could not make such a decision by himself, and that he'd discuss the request with army leaders and later inform Jović's office about their decision.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; Kadijević then said that their decision was against the putsch and that he informed Jović's office in written form about it.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; Jović for his part, claims that such document doesn't exist.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

Ante Marković has described that after the Presidency meeting failed to achieve the results the Army wanted that Kadijević met with him with the proposed coup d'etat against the secessionist republics.&lt;ref name="Lenard J.

P323"/&gt; Kadijević replied "He is only one fighting for Yugoslavia. Without him, we could not be proposing this." Marković rejected the plan and afterwards communication between Kadijević and Marković broke down.&lt;ref name="Lenard J. Cohen 2008. P323"/&gt;

{{See also|Yugoslav People's Army|Military of Serbian Krajina}}
The JNA was initially formed during World War II to carry out [[guerrilla warfare]] against occupying [[Axis powers|Axis forces]]. The success of the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisan movement]] led to the JNA basing much of its operational strategy on guerrilla warfare, as its plans normally entailed defending against [[NATO]] or [[Warsaw Pact]] attacks, where other types of warfare would put the JNA in a comparatively poor position. That approach led to maintenance of a [[Military doctrine#Territorial Defense Forces|Territorial Defense system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The military structure, strategy and tactics of the warring factions |url=http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/anx/iii.htm#III |author=Final report of the United Nations Commission of Experts established pursuant to security council resolution 780 (1992) |publisher=University of the West of England |date=28 December 1994 |accessdate=20 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207162340/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/anx/iii.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On paper, the JNA seemed a powerful force, with 2,000 [[tank]]s and 300 [[jet aircraft]] (mainly [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] or locally produced). However, by 1991, the majority of this equipment was 30 years old, as the force consisted primarily of [[T-54/55]] tanks and [[MiG-21]] aircraft.&lt;ref name="Western European Union107"&gt;[[#Western European Union|Western European Union (1986)]], p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the JNA operated around 300 [[M-84]] tanks (a Yugoslav version of the Soviet [[T-72]]) and a sizable fleet of [[ground-attack aircraft]], such as the [[Soko G-4 Super Galeb]] and the [[Soko J-22 Orao]], whose armament included [[AGM-65 Maverick]] guided missiles.&lt;ref name="Finlan20-21"&gt;[[#Finlan|Finlan (2004)]], pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, more modern cheap anti-tank missiles (like the [[9M113 Konkurs|AT-5]]) and anti-aircraft missiles (like the [[SA-14]]) were abundant and were designed to destroy much more advanced weaponry. Before the war the JNA had 169,000 regular troops, including 70,000 professional [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]s. The fighting in [[Ten-Day War|Slovenia]] brought about a great number of desertions, and the army responded by mobilizing Serbian reserve troops. Approximately 100,000 evaded the [[Conscription|draft]], and the new conscripts proved an ineffective fighting force. The JNA resorted to reliance on [[Paramilitary|irregular militias]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Troop-Shortages"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/23/world/brutal-impasse-yugoslav-war-special-report-yugoslav-ethnic-hatreds-raise-fears.html?ref=croatia|title=Yugoslav Ethnic Hatreds Raise Fears of a War Without an End|author=Stephen Engelberg|date=23 December 1991|accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramilitary units like the [[White Eagles (paramilitary)|White Eagles]], [[Serbian Guard (paramilitary)|Serbian Guard]], Dušan Silni, and [[Serb Volunteer Guard]], which committed a number of massacres against Croat and other non-Serbs civilians, were increasingly used by the Yugoslav and Serb forces.&lt;ref name="B92-Lovas"&gt;{{cite web|title=69 hrvatskih civila ubijeno u Lovasu u oktobru 1991|trans-title=69 Croatian civilians killed in Lovas in October 1991|language=Serbian|url=http://www.b92.net/info/dokumenti/index.php?nav_id=466651|publisher=B92|date=20 October 2010|accessdate=22 December  2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="un"/&gt; There were also foreign fighters supporting the RSK, mostly from Russia.&lt;ref name="UN-Foreign-fighters"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/50/plenary/a50-390add1.htm|title=Use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination – Note by the Secretary-General|date=29 August 1995|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the retreat of the JNA forces in 1992, JNA units were reorganized as the [[Army of Serb Krajina]], which was a direct heir to the JNA organization, with little improvement.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Jan3-Ceasefire"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/03/world/yugoslav-factions-agree-to-un-plan-to-halt-civil-war.html?ref=croatia|title=Yugoslav Factions Agree to U.N.

By 1991, the JNA officer corps was dominated by Serbs and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]]; they were overrepresented in Yugoslav federal institutions, especially the army. 57.1% of JNA officers were [[Serbs]], while Serbs formed 36.3% of the population of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Bjelajac et al.|2009|p=239}} A similar structure was observed as early as 1981.&lt;ref name="Mann363"&gt;[[#Mann|Mann (1996)]], p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the two peoples combined comprised 38.8% of the population of Yugoslavia, 70% of all JNA officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were either Serbs or Montenegrins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The military structure, strategy and tactics of the warring factions |url=http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/anx/iii.htm#IV.C |author=Final report of the United Nations Commission of Experts established pursuant to security council resolution 780 (1992) |publisher=[[University of the West of England]] |date=28 December 1994 |accessdate=20 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207162340/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/anx/iii.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the JNA was instructed to "completely eliminate Croats and Slovenes from the army."{{why|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref name="Jović-icty-statement"/&gt;

[[File:Serb T-55 Battle of the Barracks.JPG|thumb|220px|The Croatian military eased their equipment shortage by seizing the JNA barracks in the [[Battle of the Barracks]].]]
The [[Military of Croatia|Croatian military]] was in a much worse state than that of the Serbs. In the early stages of the war, lack of military units meant that the [[Croatian Police]] force would take the brunt of the fighting. The [[Croatian National Guard]] ({{lang-hr|Zbor narodne garde}}), the new Croatian military, was formed on 11 April 1991, and gradually developed into the [[Croatian Army]] ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska vojska}}) by 1993. Weaponry was in short supply, and many units were either unarmed or were equipped with obsolete World War II-era rifles. The Croatian Army had only a handful of tanks, including World War II-surplus vehicles such as the [[T-34]], and its air force was in an even worse state, consisting of only a few Antonov [[An-2]] [[biplane]] [[Agricultural aircraft|crop-dusters]] that had been converted to drop makeshift bombs.&lt;ref name="An2-Mader"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Georg Mader|publisher=Aerospace Publishing|location=London, UK|title=Croatia's embargoed air force|year=2006|journal= World Air Power Journal|volume=24|issue=Spring|page=145|isbn=1-874023-66-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frucht562"&gt;[[#Frucht|Frucht (2005)]], p. 562&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1991, the Croatian Army had fewer than 20 [[brigade]]s. After general [[mobilization]] was instituted in October, the size of the army grew to 60 brigades and 37 independent battalions by the end of the year.&lt;ref name="NigelThomas-YugoslavWars"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Mobilization-6Oct1991"/&gt; In 1991 and 1992, Croatia was also supported by 456 foreign fighters, including British (139), French (69), and German (55).&lt;!-- These would have to be ethnic Croats; shouldn't it be specified?? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] |url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/72091/zivot-nakon-rata-za-tudu-domovinu |publisher=NCL Media Grupa d.o.o. |title=Život nakon rata za tuđu domovinu |trans-title=Life after a war for a foreign homeland |language=Croatian |author=Berislav Jelinić |date=24 November 2009 |accessdate=23 January 2011 |archivedate=July 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69LrciDVE?url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/72091/zivot-nakon-rata-za-tudu-domovinu |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The seizure of the [[Battle of the barracks|JNA's barracks]] between September and December helped to alleviate the Croatians' equipment shortage.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Barracks-24Sep1991"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/24/world/serbs-and-croats-seeing-war-in-different-prisms.html?pagewanted=all|title=Serbs and Croats: Seeing War in Different Prisms|author=Alan Cowell|authorlink=Alan S.

[[Ethnic hatred]] grew as various incidents fueled the [[Role of the media in the Yugoslav wars|propaganda]] machines on both sides.

In March and April 1991, Serbs in Croatia began to make moves to secede from that territory. It is a matter of debate to what extent this move was locally motivated and to what degree the Milošević-led Serbian government was involved.

From the beginning of the Log Revolution and the end of April 1991, nearly 200 incidents involving the use of explosive devices and 89 attacks on the Croatian police were recorded.&lt;ref name="Annex IV"/&gt; The [[Ministry of the Interior (Croatia)|Croatian Ministry of the Interior]] started arming an [[Croatian special police order of battle in 1991–95|increasing number of special police]] forces, and this led to the building of a real army.

Significant clashes from this period included the [[1991 siege of Kijevo|siege of Kijevo]], where over a thousand people were besieged in the inner Dalmatian village of Kijevo, and the [[Borovo Selo killings]], where Croatian policemen engaged Serb paramilitaries in the eastern Slavonian village of Borovo and suffered twelve casualties.&lt;ref name="NYT-1991-05-05"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/05/world/one-more-dead-as-clashes-continue-in-yugoslavia.html?ref=croatia|title=One More Dead as Clashes Continue in Yugoslavia|author=Stephen Engelberg|date=5 May 1991|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence gripped eastern Slavonian villages: in [[Tovarnik]], a Croat policeman was killed by Serb paramilitaries on 2 May, while in [[Sotin]], a Serb civilian was killed on 5 May when he was caught in a crossfire between Serb and Croat paramilitaries.&lt;ref name="NYT-1991-05-05"/&gt; On 6 May, the [[1991 protest in Split]] against the siege of Kijevo at the Navy Command in Split resulted in the death of a Yugoslav People's Army soldier.

On 15 May, [[Stjepan Mesić]], a Croat, was scheduled to be the chairman of the rotating presidency of Yugoslavia. Serbia, aided by Kosovo, Montenegro, and Vojvodina, whose presidency votes were at that time under Serbian control, blocked the appointment, which was otherwise seen as largely ceremonial.

The government of Yugoslavia responded to the declarations of independence of Croatia and Slovenia with Yugoslav Prime Minister [[Ante Marković]] declaring the secessions to be illegal and contrary to the Constitution of Yugoslavia, and supported the JNA taking action to secure the integral unity of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Lenard J.

In June and July 1991, the [[Ten-Day War|short armed conflict in Slovenia]] came to a speedy end, partly because of the ethnic homogeneity of the population of Slovenia.&lt;ref name=BrownKarim117/&gt; It was later revealed that a military strike against Slovenia, followed by a planned withdrawal, was conceived by Slobodan Milošević and [[Borisav Jović]], then president of the SFR Yugoslavia presidency.

It also coincided with the end of [[Operation Coast-91]], in which the JNA failed to occupy the coastline in an attempt to cut off Dalmatia's access to the rest of Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/04/world/navy-blockade-of-croatia-is-renewed.html?ref=croatia | title = Navy Blockade of Croatia Is Renewed | author= Chuck Sudetic | authorlink= Chuck Sudetic | date = October 3, 1991 | accessdate=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the 5th JNA Corps advance across the [[Sava|Sava River]] towards [[Pakrac]] and further north into western Slavonia,{{sfn|Bjelajac et al.|2009|p=245}} the Croatian army began a successful [[counterattack]] in early November 1991, its first major offensive operation of the war.

Also in eastern Slavonia, the [[Lovas massacre]] occurred in October&lt;ref name="B92-Lovas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JURIST-Lovas"/&gt; and the [[Erdut massacre]] in November 1991, before and after the fall of Vukovar.&lt;ref name="icty"&gt;[[#Milošević Indictment|Milošević indictment]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the [[Škabrnja massacre]] occurred in the northern Dalmatian hinterland; it was largely overshadowed by the events at Vukovar.&lt;ref name="CNN-Škabrnja"/&gt;

On 14 November, the Navy blockade of Dalmatian ports was challenged by civilian ships. The confrontation culminated in the [[Battle of the Dalmatian channels]], when Croatian [[Coastal artillery|coastal and island based artillery]] damaged, sank, or captured a number of Yugoslav navy vessels, including ''Mukos'' PČ 176, later rechristened PB 62 ''Šolta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] |publisher=NCL Media Grupa d.o.o. |url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/47102/bitka-za-jedrenjak-jadran |title=Bitka za jedrenjak 'Jadran' |language=Croatian |trans-title=Battle for 'Jadran' sailing ship |author=Eduard Šoštarić |date=July 8, 2008 |accessdate=January 25, 2011 |archivedate=July 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69LrWYHWx?url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/47102/bitka-za-jedrenjak-jadran |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the battle, the Yugoslav naval operations were effectively limited to the southern [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wertheim|Wertheim (2007)]], pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt;

Croatian forces made further advances in the second half of December, including [[Operation Orkan 91]].

Mediated by foreign diplomats, ceasefires were frequently signed and frequently broken.

The [[Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia]], also referred to as Badinter Arbitration Committee, was set up by the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) on August 27, 1991, to provide the Conference on Yugoslavia with legal advice. The five-member Commission consisted of presidents of [[Constitutional Court]]s in the EEC. Starting in late November 1991, the committee rendered ten opinions. The Commission stated, among other things, that SFR Yugoslavia was in the process of dissolution and that the internal boundaries of Yugoslav republics may not be altered unless freely agreed upon.&lt;ref name="pellet"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Allain Pellet |title=The Opinions of the Badinter Arbitration Committee: A Second Breath for the Self-Determination of Peoples |journal=European Journal of International Law |year=1992 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=178–185 |format=PDF |url=http://207.57.19.226/journal/Vol3/No1/art12-13.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529223410/http://207.57.19.226/journal/Vol3/No1/art12-13.pdf |archivedate=May 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors in favour of Croatia's preservation of its pre-war borders were the Yugoslav Federal Constitution Amendments of 1971, and the Yugoslav Federal Constitution of 1974. The 1971 amendments introduced a concept that sovereign rights were exercised by the federal units, and that the federation had only the authority specifically transferred to it by the constitution. The [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 Constitution]] confirmed and strengthened the principles introduced in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Čobanov|first1=Saša|last2=Rudolf|first2=Davorin|publisher=[[University of Split|University of Split, Faculty of Law]]|url=http://www.pravst.hr/zbornik.php?p=25&amp;s=170|language=Croatian|title=Jugoslavija: unitarna država ili federacija povijesne težnje srpskoga i hrvatskog naroda&amp;nbsp;– jedan od uzroka raspada Jugoslavije|trans-title=Yugoslavia: a unitary state or federation of historic efforts of Serbian and Croatian nations—one of the causes of breakup of Yugoslavia|year=2009|journal=Zbornik radova Pravnog fakulteta u Splitu|volume=46|issue=2|issn=1847-0459|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rich"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roland Rich|title=Recognition of States: The Collapse of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union|journal=European Journal of International Law|year=1993|issue=1|volume=4|pages=36–65|url=http://www.ejil.org/article.php?article=1207&amp;issue=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The borders had been defined by demarcation commissions in 1947, pursuant to decisions of [[AVNOJ]] in 1943 and 1945 regarding the federal organization of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Egon Kraljević|publisher=[[Croatian State Archives]]|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=41791|language=Croatian|title=Prilog za povijest uprave: Komisija za razgraničenje pri Predsjedništvu Vlade Narodne Republike Hrvatske 1945-1946|trans-title=Contribution to the history of public administration: commission for the boundary demarcation at the government's presidency of the People's Republic of Croatia, 1945–1946 (English language summary title)|date=November 2007| journal=Arhivski vjesnik|volume=50|issue=50|format=PDF|issn=0570-9008|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new UN-sponsored [[ceasefire]], the fifteenth one in just six months, was agreed on January 2, 1992, and came into force the next day.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Jan3-Ceasefire"/&gt; This so-called [[Sarajevo Agreement]] became a lasting ceasefire.

The Yugoslav People's Army took thousands of prisoners during the war in Croatia, and interned them in camps in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro. The Croatian forces also captured some Serbian prisoners, and the two sides agreed to several [[prisoner exchange]]s; most prisoners were freed by the end of 1992. Some infamous prisons included the [[Sremska Mitrovica camp]], the [[Stajićevo camp]], and the [[Begejci camp]] in Serbia, and the [[Morinj camp]] in Montenegro.&lt;ref name="camp"/&gt; The Croatian Army also established detention camps, such as the [[Lora prison camp]] in [[Split, Croatia|Split]].&lt;ref name="camp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Final report of the United Nations Commission of Experts, established pursuant to the UN Security Council Resolution 780 (1992), Annex VIII—Prison camps; Under the Direction of: M.

Armed conflict in Croatia continued intermittently on a smaller scale. There were several smaller operations undertaken by Croatian forces to relieve the siege of Dubrovnik, and other Croatian cities (Šibenik, Zadar and Gospić) from Krajina forces. Battles included the [[Miljevci plateau incident]] (between [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]] and [[Drniš]]), on June 21–22, 1992,&lt;ref name="NYT-Miljevci-24Jun1992"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/24/world/croatian-troops-hit-serbian-area.html?ref=croatia | title= Croatian Troops Hit Serbian Area | newspaper= The New York Times | author= Michael T.

{{Further|Operation Maslenica|Operation Medak Pocket}}
[[File:Medak pocket battle map.png|thumb|220px|Map of [[Operation Medak Pocket]]]]
Fighting was renewed at the beginning of 1993, as the Croatian army launched [[Operation Maslenica]], an offensive operation in the Zadar area on January 22. The objective of the attack was to improve the strategic situation in that area, as it targeted the city airport and the [[Maslenica Bridge (D8)|Maslenica Bridge]],&lt;ref name="NYT-Maslenica-24Jan92"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/world/croats-battle-serbs-for-a-key-bridge-near-the-adriatic.html?scp=3&amp;sq=maslenica&amp;st=cse | title = Croats Battle Serbs for a Key Bridge Near the Adriatic | author= Chuck Sudetic | authorlink= Chuck Sudetic | date = January 24, 1993 | accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the last entirely overland link between Zagreb and the city of Zadar until the bridge area was captured in September 1991.{{sfn|Bjelajac et al.|2009|p=242}} The attack proved successful as it met its declared objectives,&lt;ref name="NYT-Cosic-25Jan92"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/25/world/yugoslav-leader-threatens-croats.html?sq=maslenica&amp;scp=4&amp;st=cse | title = Yugoslav Leader Threatens Croats | author= Chuck Sudetic | authorlink= Chuck Sudetic | date = January 25, 1992 | accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at a high cost, as 114 Croat and 490 Serb soldiers were killed in a relatively limited theater of operations.&lt;ref name="NovaTV-Maslenica-20Jan07"&gt;{{cite web | work= dnevnik.hr | publisher = [[Nova TV (Croatia)]] | url = http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/maslenica-obiljezava-14-obljetnicu.html | title = 'Maslenica' obilježava 14.obljetnicu |trans-title='Maslenica' marks its 14th anniversary | language= Croatian | date = January 20, 2007 | accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Operation Maslenica was in progress, Croatian forces attacked Serb positions {{convert|130|km|sp=us}} to the east. They advanced towards the [[Peruća Lake|Peruća Hydroelectric Dam]] and captured it by January 28, 1993, shortly after Serb militiamen chased away the UN peacekeepers protecting the dam.&lt;ref name="NYT-Peruca-29Jan92"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/29/world/battle-for-dam-in-croatia-grows-ousting-un-force.html?pagewanted=all | title = Battle for Dam in Croatia Grows, Ousting U.N.

He risked being disciplined for acting beyond his authority by lowering the reservoir level, which held {{convert|0.54|km3|sp=us}} of water, before the dam was blown up.

[[Operation Medak Pocket]] took place in a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] south of Gospić, from September 9–17.

The ICTY later indicted Croatian officers for war crimes. The operation was halted amid international pressure, and an agreement was reached that the Croatian troops were to withdraw to positions held prior to September 9, while UN troops were to occupy the salient alone.

On February 18, 1993, Croatian authorities signed the [[Daruvar Agreement]] with local Serb leaders in Western Slavonia. The aim of the secret agreement was normalizing life for local populations near the frontline. However, authorities in Knin learned of this and arrested the Serb leaders responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martic Owed His Fame to The Knin Roadblocks|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/martic-owed-his-fame-to-the-knin-roadblocks.29.html?cat_id=1&amp;news_id=9441|publisher=Sense-Agency|date=January 16, 2006|accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1993, Serbs began voting in a referendum on merging Krajina territory with [[Republika Srpska]].&lt;ref name="merger"/&gt; Milan Martić, acting as the RSK interior minister, advocated a merger of the "two Serbian states as the first stage in the establishment of a state of all Serbs" in his April 3 letter to the Assembly of the Republika Srpska.

A letter dated April 3, 1993 from, inter alia, Milan Martic as minister of the interior to the Assembly of the RS, written on behalf of "the Serbs from the RSK", advocates a joinder of the "two Serbian states as the first stage in the establishment of a state of all Serbs". Moreover, in this regard, the Trial Chamber recalls the evidence concerning operation Koridor 92.

During this time, unsuccessful negotiations mediated by the UN were under way between the Croatian and RSK governments. The matters under discussion included opening the Serb-occupied part of the [[A3 (Croatia)|Zagreb–Slavonski Brod motorway]] near [[Okučani]] to transit traffic, as well as the putative status of Serbian-majority areas within Croatia. The motorway initially reopened at the end of 1994, but it was soon closed again due to security issues. Repeated failures to  resolve the two disputes would serve as triggers for major Croatian offensives in 1995.&lt;ref name="A3-reopens-1994"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/04/world/opened-road-in-croatia-path-to-peace.html|title=Opened Road in Croatia: Path to Peace?|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Stephen Kinzer|authorlink=Stephen Kinzer|date=4 January 1995|accessdate=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He added that heavy tank and artillery fire against the town of [[Velika Kladuša]] in the north of the Bihać enclave was coming from the RSK. Western military analysts said that among the array of Serbian [[surface-to-air missile]] systems that surround the Bihać pocket on Croatian territory, there was a modern [[SAM-2]] system probably brought there from Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/28/world/hard-fought-ground.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | title = Hard-Fought Ground |newspaper= The New York Times | author = Roger Cohen | authorlink = Roger Cohen | date = October 28, 1994 | accessdate =November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the situation, the Security Council passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 958|Resolution 958]], which allowed NATO aircraft deployed as a part of the [[Operation Deny Flight]] to operate in Croatia.  On November 21, NATO attacked the [[Udbina]] airfield controlled by the RSK, temporarily disabling runways. Following the Udbina strike, NATO continued to launch strikes in the area, and on November 23, after a NATO reconnaissance plane was illuminated by the radar of a surface-to-air missile (SAM) system, NATO planes attacked a SAM site near [[Dvor, Croatia|Dvor]] with [[AGM-88 HARM]] [[anti-radiation missiles]].&lt;ref name="b182183"&gt;[[#Bucknam|Bucknam (2003)]], pp. 182–83&lt;/ref&gt;

In later campaigns, the Croatian army would pursue a variant of [[blitzkrieg]] tactics, with the Guard brigades punching through the enemy lines while the other units simply held the lines at other points and completed an encirclement of the enemy units.&lt;ref name="NigelThomas-YugoslavWars"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramet-3Yugoslavias-452"/&gt; In a further attempt to bolster its armed forces, Croatia hired [[Military Professional Resources Inc.]] (MPRI) in September 1994 to train some of its officers and NCOs.&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity-MPRI"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/ops/croatia.htm | title= Croatia – Operation Storm 1995 | publisher= GlobalSecurity.org | accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Begun in January 1995, MPRI's assignment involved fifteen advisors who taught basic officer leadership skills and training management.

Tensions were renewed at the beginning of 1995 as Croatia sought to put increasing pressure on the RSK. In a five-page letter on 12 January [[Franjo Tuđman]] formally told the UN Secretary General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] that Croatia was ending the agreement permitting the stationing of UNPROFOR in Croatia, effective 31 March. The move was purportedly motivated by actions by Serbia and the Serb-dominated Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to provide assistance to the Serb occupation of Croatia and allegedly integrate the occupied areas into Yugoslav territory. The situation was noted and addressed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes-UNPROFOR-dismissed"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/13/world/croatia-tells-un-troop-accord-ends.html?ref=croatia|title=Croatia Tells U.N.

International peacemaking efforts continued, and a new peace plan called the [[Z-4 plan]] was presented to Croatian and Krajina authorities. There was no initial Croatian response, and the Serbs flatly refused the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Martić Verdict|Martić Verdict]], p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; As the deadline for UNPROFOR to pull out neared, a new UN peacekeeping mission was proposed with an increased mandate to patrol Croatia's internationally recognized borders.

Violence erupted again in early May 1995. The RSK lost support from the Serbian government in Belgrade, partly as a result of international pressure. At the same time, the Croatian [[Operation Flash]] reclaimed all of the previously occupied territory in Western Slavonia.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Flash-May2"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper= The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/02/world/croatia-hits-area-rebel-serbs-hold-crossing-un-lines.html?ref=croatia|title=Croatia Hits Area Rebel Serbs Hold, Crossing U.N.

During the following months, international efforts mainly concerned the largely unsuccessful [[United Nations Safe Areas]] set up in Bosnia and Herzegovina and trying to set up a more lasting ceasefire in Croatia. The two issues virtually merged by July 1995 when a number of the safe areas in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina were [[Srebrenica massacre|overrun]] and one in [[Bihać]] was threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/croats-ready-to-hurl-troops-into-battle-of-bihac-1593388.html|title=Croats ready to hurl troops into battle of Bihać|work=The Independent|location=UK|author=Tony Barber|date=28 October 1995|accessdate=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Croatia had already signaled that it would not allow Bihać to be captured,&lt;ref name="Ramet-3Yugoslavias-452"/&gt; and a new confidence in the Croatian military's ability to recapture occupied areas brought about a demand from Croatian authorities that no further ceasefires were to be negotiated; the occupied territories would be re-integrated into Croatia.&lt;ref name="LATimes-Analysis-Aug1"&gt;{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-08-01/news/mn-30190_1_balkan-war|title=Balkan War Looms as Croatia Widens Its Reach|author=William D.

In it, Bosnia and Herzegovina invited Croatia to provide military and other assistance, particularly in the Bihać area. Croatia accepted, committing itself to an armed intervention.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-SplitDeclaration-23Jul1995"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/23/world/croatia-to-assist-bosnia.html?ref=croatia|title=Croatia to Assist Bosnia|date=23 July 1995|accessdate=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 25–30 July, the Croatian Army and Croatian Defence Council (HVO) troops attacked Serb-held territory north of Mount [[Dinara]], capturing [[Bosansko Grahovo]] and [[Glamoč]] during [[Operation Summer '95]]. That offensive paved the way for the military recapture of occupied territory around Knin, as it severed the last efficient resupply route between Banja Luka and Knin.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Summer95-30Jul1995"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/30/world/croatia-presses-offensive-against-serbs.html|author=Alan Cowell|authorlink= Alan Cowell|title=Croatia Presses Offensive Against Serbs|date=30 July 1995|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 August, Croatia started [[Operation Storm]], with the aim of recapturing almost all of the occupied territory in Croatia, except for a comparatively small strip of land, located along the [[Danube]], at a considerable distance from the bulk of the contested land.

The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) was established by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 827|UN Security Council Resolution 827]], which was passed on 25 May 1993. The court has power to prosecute persons responsible for serious violations of [[international humanitarian law]], breaches of the [[Geneva Conventions]], violating the [[Laws of war|laws or customs of war]], committing [[genocide]], and [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]] committed in the territory of the former SFR Yugoslavia since 1 January 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statute of the Tribunal|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/135|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]|date=September 2009|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Serbia and Croatia never declared war on each other, Serbia was directly and indirectly involved in the war through a number of activities.&lt;ref name="NYT-undeclared-08Jan1992"/&gt; Its foremost involvement entailed material support of the JNA. Following the independence of various republics from SFR Yugoslavia, Serbia provided the bulk of manpower and funding that was channeled to the war effort through Serbian control of the Yugoslav presidency and the federal defense ministry.&lt;ref name="Jović-icty-statement"/&gt; Serbia actively supported various paramilitary volunteer units from Serbia that were fighting in Croatia.&lt;ref name="B92-Lovas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="un"/&gt; Even though no actual fighting occurred on Serbian or Montenegrin soil, involvement of the two was evident through the maintenance of prison camps in Serbia and Montenegro, which became places where a number of war crimes were committed.&lt;ref name="camp"/&gt;

Milošević's trial at the ICTY revealed numerous declassified documents of Belgrade's involvement in the wars in Croatia and Bosnia.&lt;ref name="hrw1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Serbia-Aid-27July1991"/&gt; Evidence introduced at trial showed exactly how Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia financed the war, that they provided weapons and material support to Bosnian and Croatian Serbs, and demonstrated the administrative and personnel structures set up to support the Bosnian Serb and Croatian Serb armies.&lt;ref name="hrw1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Perišić Verdict|Perišić verdict]], pp. 3, 8&lt;/ref&gt; It was established that Belgrade, through the federal government, financed more than 90 percent of the Krajina budget in 1993; that the Supreme Defense Council decided to hide aid to Republika Srpska and Krajina from the public; that the National Bank of Krajina operated as a branch office of the National Bank of Yugoslavia; and that by March 1994 FR Yugoslavia, Krajina, and Republika Srpska used a single currency. Numerous documents demonstrated that branches of the Krajina Public Accountancy Service were incorporated into Serbia's accountancy system in May 1991, and that the financing of Krajina and Republika Srpska caused hyperinflation in FR Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="hrw1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Weighing the Evidence – Lessons from the Slobodan Milosevic Trial|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/11081/section/5|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date= December 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial revealed that the JNA, the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Serbia)|Serbian Ministry of Interior]], and other entities (including Serb civilian groups and police) armed Serb civilians and local territorial defense groups in the RSK before the conflict escalated.&lt;ref name="hrw1"/&gt;

In 1993, the [[US State Department]] reported that right after the Maslenica and Medak pocket operations, authorities in Serbia dispatched substantial numbers of "volunteers" to Serb-held territories in Croatia to fight.&lt;ref name="hri"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/docs/USSD-Rights/93/Croatia93.html|title=Croatia Human Rights Practices, 1993|publisher=US Department of State|date=31 January  1994|accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former secretary of Serbian criminal [[Željko Ražnatović|Željko Ražnatović Arkan]] testified at the Hague, confirming that the paramilitary leader took his orders, and his money, directly from the [[secret police]] run by Milošević.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00D15FB345E0C778EDDAD0894DB404482&amp;scp=8&amp;sq=erdut&amp;st=cse|author=Marlise Simons|authorlink=Marlise Simons|title=Mystery Witness Faces Milosevic|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 April 2003|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This degree of control was reflected in negotiations held at various times between Croatian authorities and the RSK, as the Serbian leadership under Milošević was regularly consulted and frequently made decisions on behalf of the RSK.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Jan3-Ceasefire"/&gt; The Erdut Agreement that ended the war was signed by a RSK minister on instructions from Milošević.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-ErdutAgr-12Nov95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COE-CroatiaReport-Milanović"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICTY-Milošević-trial-Milanović"/&gt; The degree of control Serbia held over SFR Yugoslavia and later the RSK was evidenced through testimonies during the Milošević trial at the ICTY.&lt;ref name="Jović-icty-statement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COE-CroatiaReport-Milanović"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICTY-Milošević-trial-Milanović"/&gt;

==Role of the international community==
The war developed at a time when the attention of the United States and the world was on Iraq, and the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, along with a sharp rise in oil prices and a slowdown in the growth of the world economy.&lt;ref&gt;Commodity review and outlook 1991–92, [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]  [http://www.fao.org/ FAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 19 and 23 December, several other European countries, beginning with [[Germany]] and the [[Vatican City]], followed by [[Sweden]] and [[Italy]], announced their recognition of Croatia's (and Slovenia's) independence.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Germany-23Dec91"/&gt; The [[European Union]] as a whole recognized the independence of the two republics on 15 January 1992.

Each of the major foreign governments acted somewhat differently:
*{{flag|Germany}} – up until 1991, Germany supported a 'status quo'.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glaurdic|Glaurdic (2011)]], pp. 59, 124-125&lt;/ref&gt; According to diplomat Gerhard Almer, the Yugoslav disintegration was feared as "a bad example for the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]", sparking fears that violence could also be used against the nations that were about to declare independence from the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glaurdic|Glaurdic (2011)]], p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, this policy changed, when Helmut Kohl announced that Germany recognized Slovenia and Croatia as independent countries.
*{{flag|United Kingdom}} – [[John Major]]'s government favoured neutrality.
*{{flag|United States}} – The United States, under [[George H. W. Bush]], tended to favour non-intervention at first,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glaurdic|Glaurdic (2011)]], p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; just like the United Kingdom. In contrast, from 1993, the administration led by [[Bill Clinton]] tended to engage itself in order to end the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. [[Cyrus Vance]] supported the 'integrity of Yugoslavia'.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glaurdic|Glaurdic (2011)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;264–265&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flagicon|Russia|1991}} [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] – The Russian government under [[Boris Yeltsin]] tended to oppose recognition of Croatia although Russia recognized Croatia on 17 February 1992, while the United States did the same on 7 April 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Azrael, Jeremy R. and Emil A.

'''Depleted uranium''' ('''DU'''; also referred to in the past as '''Q-metal''', '''depletalloy''' or '''D-38''') is [[uranium]] with a lower content of the [[fissile]] [[isotope]] [[uranium-235|U-235]] than natural uranium.&lt;ref name = "McDiarmid 2001 123"&gt;{{Harvnb|McDiarmid|2001|p=123}}: "Depleted uranium possesses only 60% of the radioactivity of natural uranium, having been 'depleted' of much of its most highly radioactive U&lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt; and U&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt; isotopes."&lt;/ref&gt; Natural uranium contains about 0.72% U-235, while the DU used by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] contains 0.3% U-235 or less. Uses of DU take advantage of its very high [[density]] of 19.1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (68.4% denser than [[lead]]). The less radioactive and non-fissile [[uranium-238]] constitutes the main component of depleted uranium.

Civilian uses include [[counterweight]]s in aircraft, radiation shielding in medical [[radiation therapy]] and industrial [[radiography]] equipment, and containers for transporting radioactive materials. Military uses include [[Vehicle armour|armor plating]] and [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] [[projectiles]].

Most depleted uranium arises as a [[by-product]] of the production of [[enriched uranium]] for use as fuel in [[nuclear reactor]]s and in the manufacture of [[nuclear weapon]]s. Enrichment processes generate uranium with a higher-than-natural concentration of lower-[[atomic mass number|mass-number]] uranium isotopes (in particular U-235, which is the uranium isotope supporting the [[Nuclear fission|fission]] [[chain reaction]]) with the bulk of the feed ending up as depleted uranium, in some cases with mass fractions of U-235 and U-234 less than a third of those in natural uranium. Since U-238 has a much longer [[half-life]] than the lighter isotopes, DU emits less [[alpha radiation]] than natural uranium. DU from [[nuclear reprocessing]] has different isotopic ratios from enrichment–by-product DU, from which it can be distinguished by the presence of [[uranium-236|U-236]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/unep81.doc.htm |title=UN Environment Programme Confirms Uranium 236 found in depleted uranium penetrators |date=16 January 2001 |id=UNEP/81 |publisher=UN }}&lt;/ref&gt; As per articles in [[The Lancet]] and [[Al Jazeera]], DU due to American artillery is suspected to be one of the major causes of an increase in the general mortality rate in Iraq since 1991.&lt;ref name="lancet2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burkle |first1=Frederick |last2=Garfield |first2=Richard |title=Civilian mortality after the 2003 invasion of Iraq |journal=The Lancet |date=16 March 2013 |volume=381 |issue=9870 |pages=877-879 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62196-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jaz1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jamail |first1=Dahr |title=Iraq's wars, a legacy of cancer |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/03/2013315171951838638.html |accessdate=29 November 2018 |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DU used in US munitions has 60% of the radioactivity of natural uranium.&lt;ref name="USOSD"&gt;[http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/du_ii/du_ii_tabc.htm "Properties and Characteristics of DU"] U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense&lt;/ref&gt; Trace [[transuranic]]s (another indicator of the use of reprocessed material) have been reported to be present in some US tank armor.&lt;ref name="USOSD"/&gt;

The use of DU in [[munitions]] is controversial because of concerns about potential long-term health effects.&lt;ref name=MillerMcClain /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pattison|Hugtenburg|Green|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Normal functioning of the [[kidney]], [[Human brain|brain]], [[liver]], [[Human heart|heart]], and numerous other systems can be affected by exposure to uranium, a [[toxic metal]].&lt;ref name=Craft04 /&gt; It is only weakly [[radioactive]] because of its long [[half-life|radioactive half-life]] (4.468 billion years for uranium-238, 700 million years for [[uranium-235]]; or 1 part per million every {{n-life|n=.5|t=4.468*10^9|end=1-10^-6|dec=0}} and {{n-life|n=.5|t=700*10^6|end=1-10^-6|dec=0}} years, respectively).

The actual level of [[acute (medicine)|acute]] and [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[toxicity]] of DU is also controversial.

==History==
Enriched uranium was first manufactured in the early 1940s when the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] began their [[nuclear weapons]] programs. Later in the decade, [[France]] and the [[Soviet Union]] began their [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[nuclear power]] programs. Depleted uranium was originally stored as an unusable waste product ([[uranium hexafluoride]]) in the hope that improved enrichment processes could extract additional quantities of the [[Nuclear fission|fissionable]] U-235 [[isotope]]. This re-enrichment recovery of the residual uranium-235 is now in practice in some parts of the world; e.g. in 1996 over 6000 metric tonnes were upgraded in a Russian plant.&lt;ref&gt;

Thus most civilian reactors as well as all [[Nuclear marine propulsion|naval reactors]] and nuclear weapons production require fuel containing concentrated U-235 and generate depleted Uranium.

In the 1970s, [[the Pentagon]] reported that the [[Red Army|Soviet military]] had developed [[armor plating]] for [[Warsaw Pact]] tanks that [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] ammunition could not penetrate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} The Pentagon began searching for material to make denser armor-piercing projectiles.

===Production and availability===
[[Natural uranium]] metal contains about 0.71% [[Uranium-235|U-235]], 99.28% [[Uranium-238|U-238]], and about 0.0054% [[Uranium-234|U-234]]. The production of [[enriched uranium]] using [[isotope separation]]  creates ''depleted uranium'' containing only 0.2% to 0.4% U-235. Because natural uranium begins with such a low percentage of U-235, enrichment produces large quantities of depleted uranium. For example, producing 1&amp;nbsp;kg of 5% enriched uranium requires 11.8&amp;nbsp;kg of natural uranium, and leaves about 10.8&amp;nbsp;kg of depleted uranium having only 0.3% U-235.

The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) defines ''depleted uranium'' as uranium with a percentage of the &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U isotope that is less than 0.711% by weight (see [https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part040/part040-0004.html 10 CFR 40.4]). The military specifications designate that the DU used by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) contain less than 0.3% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U.&lt;ref name="AEPI"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shelton, S. |author2=Daxon, E. |author3=Oxenberg, T. |author4=Kowalski, R.T. |author5=Lindsay, D.O. |author6=O’Brien, G.P. |author7=Rael, J.E. |author8=Silva, D.G. |author9=Smith, R.A. |author10=Stone, S.J. |author11=Strickland, L. |author12=Thomson, B.M. |author13=Tomei Torres, F. | year= 1995 | title= Health and Environmental Consequences of Depleted Uranium Use in the U.S. Army: Technical Report | publisher=U.S. Army Environmental Policy Institute (AEPI) | doi=10.13140/2.1.3468.3201}}&lt;/ref&gt; In actuality, DoD uses only DU that contains approximately 0.2% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U.&lt;ref name="AEPI"/&gt;

===Uranium hexafluoride===
[[File:DUF6 cylinder leak.gif|thumb|right|[[Uranium hexafluoride]] tank leaking]]
Most depleted uranium is stored as [[uranium hexafluoride]], a toxic crystalline solid, (D)UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, in steel cylinders in open air storage yards close to enrichment plants. Each cylinder holds up to 12.7 tonnes (14 short tons) of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. In the U.S. 560,000 tonnes of depleted UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; had accumulated by 1993. In 2008, 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near [[Portsmouth, Ohio]]; [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]; and [[Paducah, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq16.cfm How much depleted uranium hexafluoride is stored in the United States], anl.gov&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/documents/index.cfm |title=Depleted UF6 Management Program Documents |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storage of DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; presents environmental, health, and safety risks because of its chemical instability. When UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is exposed to water vapor in the air, it reacts with the moisture to produce UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[uranyl fluoride]]), a solid, and HF ([[hydrofluoric acid|hydrogen fluoride]]), a gas, both of which are highly soluble and toxic. The uranyl fluoride solid acts to plug the leak, limiting further escape of depleted UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Release of the hydrogen fluoride gas to the atmosphere is also slowed by the plug formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq21.cfm |title=What happens if a cylinder of uranium hexafluoride leaks? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storage cylinders are regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks, and are repainted and repaired as necessary. 

Like any other uranium compound, it is radioactive, and precautions should be taken. It is also highly toxic. Uranyl fluoride is corrosive and harmful upon inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Ingestion or inhalation may be fatal. Effects of exposure may be delayed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/pdf/DUF6MgmtOverviewFS.PDF], Overview of Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride Management Program&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the United States, including one in which 32 workers were exposed to a cloud of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and its reaction products in 1986 at a Gore, Oklahoma commercial uranium conversion facility. One person died; while a few workers with higher exposure experienced short-term [[kidney]] damage (e.g., [[proteinuria|protein in the urine]]), none of them showed lasting damage from the exposure to uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/health/faq30.cfm |title=FAQ 30-Have there been accidents involving uranium hexafluoride? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government has been converting depleted UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to solid uranium oxides for use or disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq22.cfm |title=FAQ 22-What is going to happen to the uranium hexafluoride stored in the United States? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such disposal of the entire DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; inventory could cost anywhere from $15 million to $450 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/mgmt/faq27.cfm |title=FAQ 27-Are there any currently-operating disposal facilities that can accept all of the depleted uranium oxide that would be generated from conversion of DOE's depleted UF6 inventory? |publisher=Web.ead.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military applications==
[[File:M900.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The 105mm M900 [[APFSDS]]-T (Depleted Uranium Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot – Tracer)]]

Depleted uranium is very dense; at 19,050&amp;nbsp;kg/m³, it is 1.67 times as dense as [[lead]], only slightly less dense than [[tungsten]] and [[gold]], and 84% as dense as [[osmium]] or [[iridium]], which are the densest known substances under standard (i.e., Earth-surface) pressures. Consequently, a DU projectile of given mass has a smaller diameter than an equivalent lead projectile, with less [[external ballistics|aerodynamic drag]] and deeper [[terminal ballistics|penetration]] due to a higher pressure at point of impact. DU projectile ordnance is often inherently [[incendiary device|incendiary]] because uranium is [[flammable]].&lt;ref name=peacock&gt;{{Cite web |last=Peacock |first=H.

===Armor plate===
Because of its high density, depleted uranium can also be used in tank armor, sandwiched between sheets of steel armor plate. For instance, some late-production [[M1 Abrams|M1A1HA and M1A2 Abrams]] tanks built after 1998 have DU modules integrated into their [[Chobham armour#Heavy metal modules|Chobham armor]], as part of the armor plating in the front of the hull and the front of the turret, and there is a program to upgrade the rest.

===Nuclear weapons===
{{main|Nuclear weapons design}}
Depleted uranium can be used as a [[Neutron reflector#Nuclear weapons|tamper]], or neutron reflector, in [[fission bomb]]s. A high density tamper like DU makes for a longer-lasting, more energetic, and more efficient explosion.

===Ammunition===
Most military use of depleted uranium has been as [[30 mm]] ordnance, primarily the 30&amp;nbsp;mm PGU-14/B armour-piercing incendiary round from the [[GAU-8 Avenger]] cannon of the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] used by the [[United States Air Force]]. 25&amp;nbsp;mm DU rounds have been used in the [[M242]] gun mounted on the U.S. Army's [[M2 Bradley|Bradley Fighting Vehicle]] and the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]'s [[LAV-25]].

The U.S. Marine Corps uses DU in the 25&amp;nbsp;mm PGU-20 round fired by the [[GAU-12 Equalizer]] cannon of the [[AV-8 Harrier II|AV-8B Harrier]], and also in the 20&amp;nbsp;mm [[M197]] gun mounted on [[AH-1 Cobra]] helicopter gunships. The [[United States Navy]]'s [[Phalanx CIWS]]'s [[M61 Vulcan]] [[Gatling gun]] used 20&amp;nbsp;mm armor-piercing penetrator rounds with discarding [[plastic]] [[sabot]]s and a core made using depleted uranium, later changed to [[tungsten]].

[[File:Mark 149 Mod 2 20mm ammunition.jpg|thumb|upright|Mark 149 Mod 2 20mm depleted uranium ammunition for the [[Phalanx CIWS]] aboard [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']].]]

Another use of depleted uranium is in [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s, [[anti-armor]] rounds such as the 120&amp;nbsp;mm sabot rounds fired from the British [[Challenger 1]], [[Challenger 2]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh McManners|McManners, Hugh]], ''Gulf War One'' Real Voices From the Front Line, Ebury Publishing, 2010, {{ISBN|9780091935986}} p91&lt;/ref&gt; M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams.&lt;ref&gt;Fahey, D. (2003) [http://www.antenna.nl/wise/uranium/pdf/dumyths.pdf "Science or Science Fiction? Facts, Myths and Propaganda In the Debate Over Depleted Uranium Weapons"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050601054749/http://www.antenna.nl/wise/uranium/pdf/dumyths.pdf |date=1 June 2005 }}, Table 1 on p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Kinetic energy penetrator rounds consist of a long, relatively thin penetrator surrounded by a discarding [[sabot]]. [[Staballoy]]s are metal alloys of depleted uranium with a very small proportion of other metals, usually [[titanium]] or [[molybdenum]]. One formulation has a composition of 99.25% by mass of depleted uranium and 0.75% by mass of [[titanium]]. Staballoys are approximately 1.67 times as dense as lead and are designed for use in kinetic energy penetrator armor-piercing ammunition. The US Army uses DU in an alloy with around 3.5% titanium.

DU is used by the U.S. Army in 120&amp;nbsp;mm or 105&amp;nbsp;mm cannons employed on the [[M1 Abrams]] [[tank]]. The Russian military has used DU ammunition in tank main gun ammunition since the late 1970s, mostly for the 115&amp;nbsp;mm guns in the [[T-62]] tank and the 125&amp;nbsp;mm guns in the [[T-64]], [[T-72]], [[T-80]], and [[T-90]] tanks.

The DU content in various ammunition is 180&amp;nbsp;g in 20&amp;nbsp;mm projectiles, 200&amp;nbsp;g in 25&amp;nbsp;mm ones, 280&amp;nbsp;g in 30&amp;nbsp;mm, 3.5&amp;nbsp;kg in 105&amp;nbsp;mm, and 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg in 120&amp;nbsp;mm penetrators. DU was used during the mid-1990s in the U.S. to make [[hand grenade]]s, and [[land mine]]s, but those applications have been discontinued, according to [[Alliant Techsystems]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The US Navy used DU in its 20&amp;nbsp;mm [[Phalanx CIWS]] guns, but switched in the late 1990s to armor-piercing tungsten.

===Legal status in weapons===
In 1996, the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) gave an advisory opinion on the "''[[legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornnet.nl/~akmalten/unan5a.html ADVISORY OPINION 1996 July 8; General List No.95 (req: UNGA)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522005411/http://www.cornnet.nl/~akmalten/unan5a.html |date=22 May 2014 }}. Cornnet.nl. Retrieved 16 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This made it clear, in paragraphs 54, 55 and 56, that [[international law]] on poisonous weapons—the Second Hague Declaration of 29 July 1899, Hague Convention IV of 18 October 1907 and the Geneva Protocol of 17 June 1925—did not cover nuclear weapons, because their prime or exclusive use was not to poison or asphyxiate. This ICJ opinion was about nuclear weapons, but the sentence "The terms have been understood, in the practice of States, in their ordinary sense as covering weapons whose prime, or even exclusive, effect is to poison or asphyxiate," also removes depleted uranium weaponry from coverage by the same treaties as their primary use is not to poison or asphyxiate, but to destroy [[materiel]] and kill soldiers through [[kinetic energy]].

Yeung Sik Yuen to prepare, without financial implications, in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms, the working paper originally assigned to Ms. Forero Ucros."&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Y. K. J. Yeung Sik Yuen]] in accordance with [[Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights]] resolution 2001/36. He argues that the use of DU in weapons, along with the other weapons listed by the Sub‑Commission, may breach one or more of the following treaties: [[the Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[Charter of the United Nations]], the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|Genocide Convention]], the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], the [[Geneva Conventions]] including [[Protocol I]], the [[Convention on Conventional Weapons]] of 1980, and the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]]. Yeung Sik Yuen writes in Paragraph 133 under the title "''Legal compliance of weapons containing DU as a new weapon''":

{{quotation|Annex II to the [[Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material]] 1980 (which became operative on 8 February 1997) classifies DU as a category II nuclear material. Storage and transport rules are set down for that category which indicates that DU is considered sufficiently "hot" and dangerous to warrant these protections. But since weapons containing DU are relatively new weapons no treaty exists yet to regulate, limit or prohibit its use. The legality or illegality of DU weapons must therefore be tested by recourse to the general rules governing the use of weapons under humanitarian and human rights law which have already been analysed in Part I of this paper, and more particularly at paragraph 35 which states that parties to [[Protocol I]] to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 have an obligation to ascertain that new weapons do not violate the laws and customs of war or any other international law. As mentioned, the [[International Court of Justice]] considers this rule binding customary humanitarian law.}}

[[Louise Arbour]], chief prosecutor for the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] led a committee of staff lawyers to investigate possible treaty prohibitions against the use of DU in weapons. Their findings were that:&lt;ref&gt;Joe Sills ''et al'' ''[http://www.aepi.army.mil/internet/env-crime-icc-printer.pdf Environmental Crimes in Military Actions and the International Criminal Court (ICC)-United Nations Perspectives]'' (PDF) ([https://web.archive.org/web/20041015050907/http://www.aepi.army.mil/internet/env-crime-icc-printer.pdf HTML]) of American Council for the UN University, April 2002.

{{quotation|There is no specific treaty ban on the use of DU projectiles.

===Requests for a moratorium on military use===

In 2007, France, Britain, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic voted against a [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution to hold a debate in 2009 about the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium.

In September 2008, and in response to the 2007 General Assembly resolution, the [[UN Secretary General]] published the views of 15 states alongside those of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). The IAEA and WHO evidence differed little from previous statements on the issue.&lt;ref name=ICBUW&gt;Staff.

==Civilian applications==
Depleted uranium has a very high density and is primarily used as shielding material for other radioactive material, and as [[Sailing ballast|ballast]]. Examples include sailboat [[keel]]s, as [[counterweight]]s and as shielding in industrial [[radiography]] cameras.

===Shielding in industrial radiography cameras===
[[Industrial radiography]] cameras include a very high activity [[gamma radiation]] source (typically [[Iridium-192#Iridium-192|Ir-192]] with an activity above 10 TBq). Depleted uranium is often used in the cameras as a shield to protect individuals from the gamma source. Typically, the uranium shield is supported and enclosed in [[polyurethane]] foam for thermal, mechanical and oxidation protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Coloring in consumer products===
Consumer product uses have included incorporation into [[dental porcelain]], used for [[false teeth]] to simulate the fluorescence of natural teeth, and uranium-bearing reagents used in chemistry laboratories (e.g. [[uranyl acetate]], used in [[analytical chemistry]] and as a [[staining|stain]] in [[electron microscopy]]). Uranium (both depleted uranium and natural uranium) was widely used as a coloring matter for [[Fiestaware|porcelain]] and [[Uranium glass|glass]] in the 19th and early-to-mid-20th century. The practice was largely discontinued in the late 20th century. In 1999, concentrations of 10% depleted uranium were being used in "jaune no.17" a yellow [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] powder that was being produced in [[France]] by Cristallerie de Saint-Paul, a manufacturer of enamel [[pigment]]s. The depleted uranium used in the powder was sold by [[Cogéma]]'s Pierrelatte facility. In February 2000, Cogema discontinued the sale of depleted uranium to producers of enamel and glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Trim weights in aircraft===
Aircraft that contain depleted uranium trim weights for stabilizing wings and control surfaces (such as the [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747–100]]) may contain between 400 and 1,500&amp;nbsp;kg of DU.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} This application is controversial because the DU might enter the environment if the aircraft crashes. The metal can also [[oxidation|oxidize]] to a fine powder in a fire. Its use has been phased out in many newer aircraft. [[Boeing]] and [[McDonnell-Douglas]] discontinued using DU counterweights in the 1980s. Depleted uranium was released during the crash of [[El Al Flight 1862]] on 4 October 1992, in which 152&amp;nbsp;kg was lost, but a [[case study]] concluded that there was no evidence to link depleted uranium from the plane to any health problems.&lt;ref name="Uijt de Haag P.A. and Smetsers R.C. and Witlox H.W. and Krus H.W. and Eisenga A.H. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Uijt de Haag, P.A. |author2=Smetsers, R.C. |author3=Witlox, H.W. |author4=Krus, H.W. |author5=Eisenga, A.H. |title=Evaluating the risk from depleted uranium after the Boeing 747-258F crash in Amsterdam, 1992 |journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials |year=2000 |pmid= 10863013|volume= 76|issue= 1|pages= 39–58|doi= 10.1016/S0304-3894(00)00183-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counterweights manufactured with [[Plating#Cadmium plating|cadmium plating]] are considered non-hazardous while the plating is intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/0/FED21DA1A772D8D9862569AF006AADBF?OpenDocument |title=Avoiding or Minimizing Encounters with Aircraft Equipped with Depleted Uranium Balance Weights during Accident Investigations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US NRC general license===
US Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations at [https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part040/part040-0025.html 10 CFR 40.25] establish a general license for the use of depleted uranium contained in industrial products or devices for mass-volume applications. This general license allows anyone to possess or use depleted uranium for authorized purposes. Generally, a registration form is required, along with a commitment to not abandon the material. Agreement states may have similar, or more stringent, regulations.

===Sailboat keel===
[[Pen Duick|''Pen Duick VI'']], a boat designed by {{ill|André Mauric|fr}} and used for racing, was equipped with a [[keel]] of depleted uranium. The benefit is that, due to the very high density of uranium, the keel could be thinner for a given weight, and so have less resistance than a normal keel. It was later replaced by a standard lead keel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/news/7245_Roaring-Forties-chapter-22-Frances-inspiration.html |title=Roaring Forties, chapter 22: France’s inspiration |date=19 August 2013 |work=[[Volvo Ocean Race]] |accessdate=26 February 2016 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819125034/http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/news/7245_Roaring-Forties-chapter-22-Frances-inspiration.html |archive-date=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sampling calorimeters for detectors in high-energy particle physics===
Depleted uranium has been used in a number of [[calorimeter (particle physics)#Homogeneous versus sampling|sampling calorimeters]] (such as in the D0&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An Experiment at D0 to Study anti-Proton - Proton Collisions at 2-TeV: Design Report.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ZEUS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-zeus.desy.de/bluebook/ch05/chapter2_4.html|title=The ZEUS detector: Status Report 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; detectors) due to its high density and natural radioactivity.

==Health considerations==
Normal functioning of the [[kidney]], [[Human brain|brain]], [[liver]], [[Human heart|heart]], and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure because, in addition to being weakly radioactive, uranium is a [[toxic metal]],&lt;ref name=Craft04&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If DU particles do enter an individual, the type of danger presented—toxic vs. radiological—and the organ most likely to be affected depend on the solubility of the particles.&lt;ref name = "RSDUWG 2002a 1"&gt;{{Harvnb|RSDUWG|2002a|p=1}}. Briefly, inhaled and insoluble means that the DU particles will stick around in the lungs and attendant lymph nodes, presenting a radiological risk; highly soluble means those particles are off to the kidneys, where toxicity is the issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

In military conflicts involving DU munitions, the major concern is inhalation of DU particles in aerosols arising from the impacts of DU-enhanced projectiles with their targets.&lt;ref name = "RSDUWG 2002a 1"/&gt; When depleted uranium munitions penetrate armor or burn, they create depleted [[uranium oxide]]s in the form of dust that can be inhaled or contaminate wounds.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Militaries have long had risk-reduction procedures for their troops to follow,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zwijnenburg|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and studies are in consistent agreement that veterans who used DU-enhanced munitions have not suffered, so far, from an increased risk of cancer (see the Gulf War and Balkans sections below). The effects of DU on civilian populations are, however, a topic of intense and ongoing controversy.

As early as 1997, [[Royal Army Medical Corps|British Army doctors]] warned the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] that exposure to depleted uranium increased the risk of developing lung, lymph and brain cancer, and recommended a series of safety precautions.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/11/armstrade.world?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 | publisher=[[The Guardian|theguardian.com]] | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor | title=MoD knew shells were cancer risk | date=11 January 2001|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report issued summarizing the advice of the doctors, "Inhalation of insoluble [[uranium dioxide]] dust will lead to accumulation in the lungs with very slow clearance—if any. … Although chemical toxicity is low, there may be localised radiation damage of the lung leading to cancer." The report warns that "All personnel … should be aware that uranium dust inhalation carries a long-term risk … [the dust] has been shown to increase the risks of developing lung, lymph and brain cancers."&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; In 2003, the [[Royal Society]] called, again, for urgent attention to be paid to the possible health and environmental impact of depleted uranium, and added its backing to the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]'s call for a scientific assessment of sites struck with depleted uranium.&lt;ref name = "Moszynski 2003 a"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moszynski|2003}}.&lt;br&gt;The article quotes Professor Brian Spratt of the Royal Society's DU working group: "It is highly unsatisfactory to deploy a large amount of material that is weakly radioactive and chemically toxic without knowing how much soldiers and civilians have been exposed to."&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2004, the UK Pensions Appeal Tribunal Service attributed [[birth defect]] claims from a February 1991 [[Gulf War]] combat veteran to depleted uranium [[poison]]ing.&lt;ref name="vitw.org"&gt;Williams, M. (February 9, 2004) [http://vitw.org/archives/405 "First Award for Depleted Uranium Poisoning Claim,"] ''The Herald Online,'' (Edinburgh: Herald Newspapers, Ltd.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cadu.org.uk"&gt;Campaign Against Depleted Uranium (Spring, 2004) [http://www.cadu.org.uk/news/17.htm#icbuw "MoD Forced to Pay Pension for DU Contamination,"] ''CADU News 17''&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a 2005 [[epidemiology]] review concluded: "In aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU."&lt;ref name="Hindin" /&gt; Studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents continue to suggest the possibility of [[leukemia|leukemogenic]], [[gene]]tic, [[reproduction|reproductive]], and [[neurological]] effects from chronic exposure.&lt;ref name="MillerMcClain"/&gt;

===Chemical toxicity===
The chemical toxicity of depleted uranium is identical to that of natural uranium and about a million times greater ''in vivo'' than DU's radiological hazard,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|Stewart|Brooks|Shi|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with the kidney considered to be the main target organ.&lt;ref name = "RSDUWG 2002a 2"&gt;{{Harvnb|RSDUWG|2002a|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Health effects of DU are determined by factors such as the extent of exposure and whether it was internal or external. Three main pathways exist by which internalization of uranium may occur: [[inhalation]], [[ingestion]], and embedded fragments or [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Livengood|1996|p=3}}; {{Harvnb|RSDUWG|2002a|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Properties such as phase (e.g. particulate or gaseous), oxidation state (e.g. metallic or ceramic), and the solubility of uranium and its compounds influence their [[Absorption (skin)|absorption]], [[Distribution (pharmacology)|distribution]], translocation, [[Clearance (medicine)|elimination]] and the resulting toxicity. For example, metallic uranium is less toxic compared to hexavalent uranium(VI) [[uranyl]] compounds such as [[uranium trioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;«Gmelin Handbuch der anorganischen Chemie» 8th edition, English translation, ''Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry,'' vol.

The [[World Health Organization]] has established a daily "tolerated intake" of soluble uranium salts for the general public of 0.5&amp;nbsp;µg/kg body weight, or 35&amp;nbsp;µg for a 70&amp;nbsp;kg adult.

Approximately 90 [[microgram]]s of natural uranium, on average, exist in the human body as a result of normal intake of water, food and air. Most is in the [[skeleton]]. The [[biochemistry]] of depleted uranium is the same as natural uranium.

===Radiological hazards===

The primary radiation danger from pure depleted uranium is due to [[alpha particle]]s, which do not travel far through air, and do not penetrate clothing. However, in a matter of a month or so, a sample of pure depleted uranium will generate small amounts of [[thorium-234]] and [[protactinium-234]], which emit the more penetrating [[beta particle]]s at almost the same rate as the uranium emits alpha rays. This is because uranium-238 decays directly to thorium-234, which with a half-life of 24 days decays to protactinium-234, which in turn decays in a matter of hours to the long-lived uranium-234. A quasi-steady state is therefore reached within a few multiples of 24 days.&lt;ref&gt;The amounts of both thorium-234 and protactinium-234 after the first days and for millions of years thereafter will be approximately proportional to 1−2&lt;sup&gt; −t / (24 days)&lt;/sup&gt;. See {{cite book|author1=Kenneth S. Krane|title=Introductory Nuclear Physics|date=1988|isbn=978-0-471-80553-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Available evidence suggests that the radiation risk is small relative to the chemical hazard.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Surveying the veteran-related evidence pertaining to the Gulf War, a 2001 editorial in the ''[[BMJ]]'' concluded that it was not possible to justify claims of radiation-induced lung cancer and leukaemia in veterans of that conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McDiarmid|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While agreeing with the editorial's conclusion, a reply noted that its finding in the negative was guaranteed, given that "global dose estimates or results of mathematical modelling are too inaccurate to be used as dose values for an individual veteran", and that, as of April 2001, no practical method of measuring the expected small doses that each individual veteran would receive had been suggested.&lt;ref name = "Mould 2001"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mould|2001}}.&lt;br&gt;Mould's suggestion was [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] [[dosimetry]] using tooth enamel. He also wrote that the US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] was able, using this method, to measure doses as low as 20&amp;nbsp;mSv, and that, if it were asked to, the NIST would be able to get involved, meaning at least one centre could help undertake a screening programme for veterans.&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the reply, a radiation scientist, went on to suggest a method that had been used several times before, including after the 1986 Chernobyl accident.&lt;ref name = "Mould 2001"/&gt; Despite the widespread use of DU in the [[Iraq War]], at least a year after the conflict began, testing for UK troops was still only in the discussion phase.&lt;ref name = "GIUHW 2004"&gt;{{Harvnb|Greenberg|Iversen|Unwin|Hull|2004}}, which found that perhaps a quarter of all UK troops would have been interested in undergoing DU-related monitoring, although "the desire for DU screening is more closely linked to current health status rather than plausible exposure to DU."&lt;p&gt;Confusingly, {{Harvnb|Moszynski|2003}} reports that "testing is now available to all troops that served in Iraq", and does not say if this is testing à la Mould.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Society DU Working Group concluded in 2002 that there were "very low" health risks associated with the use of depleted uranium, though also ventured that, "[i]n extreme conditions and under worst-case assumptions" lung and kidney damage could occur, and that in "worst-case scenarios high local levels of uranium could occur in food or water that could have adverse effects on the kidney".&lt;ref&gt;The study is mentioned by {{Harvnb|Patel|2006}}.&lt;br&gt;According to Patel, "[t]he majority evidence and expert opinion on the lack of a clear association between depleted uranium are quite consistent". Similarly, {{Harvnb|Murphy|Greenberg|Bland|2009}}: "[T]here is now a large body of evidence to suggest that, whatever the cause of the ill‐health experienced by Gulf War veterans, neither DU nor vaccinations are likely to have caused them."&lt;p&gt;The Working Group study he mentions is {{Harvnb|Royal Society DU Working Group|2002b}}, which is a summary of the second part of the Working Group's look at the health effects of DU: Part&amp;nbsp;1: {{Harvnb|RSDUWG|2001}}; Part&amp;nbsp;2: {{Harvnb|RSDUWG|2002a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Royal Society issued another urgent call to investigate the actual health and environmental impact of depleted uranium.&lt;ref name = "Moszynski 2003 a"/&gt; The same year, a [[cohort study]] of Gulf War veterans found no elevated risks of cancer generally, nor of any specific cancers in particular, though recommended follow up studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Macfarlane|Biggs|Maconochie|Hotopf|2003}}: "There is no current excess risk of cancer overall nor of site specific cancers in Gulf war veterans. Specific exposures during deployment have not resulted in a subsequent increased risk of cancer. The long latent period for cancer, however, necessitates the continued follow up of these cohorts."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Health Organization]], a [[Ionizing radiation|radiation]] [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] from it would be about 60% of that from purified natural uranium with the same mass; the [[radiological]] dangers are lower due to its longer half-life and the removal of the more radioactive isotopes.

{{Main|Gulf War syndrome}}

Since 1991, the year the [[Gulf War]] ended, veterans and their families voiced concern about subsequent health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Murphy|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dr. Doug Rokke"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr. Doug Rokke |url=https://ratical.org/radiation/DU/DRonDU2000.html |website=radical.org |date=10 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, an assessment of the first 1,000 veterans involved in the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]'s Gulf War medical assessment programme found "no evidence" of a single illness, physical or mental, that would explain the pattern of symptoms observed in the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coker|Bhatt|Blatchley|Graham|1999}}: "As the veterans assessed by the programme were all self selected, the prevalence of illness in Gulf war veterans cannot be determined from this study. Furthermore, it is not known whether the veterans in this study were representative of sick veterans as a group."&lt;br&gt;To recapitulate using {{Harvnb|Murphy|1999}}: "[T]hough Gulf War veterans' illnesses are real and sometimes disabling, they do not seem to constitute a unique illness."&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1999, [[MEDACT]] petitioned for the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] to conduct an investigation into illnesses in veterans and Iraqi civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stott|Holdstock|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A major 2006 review of peer-reviewed literature by a US [[Institute of Medicine]] committee concluded that, "[b]ecause the symptoms vary greatly among individuals", they do not point to a syndrome unique to Gulf War veterans, though their report conceded that the lack of objective pre-deployment health data meant definitive conclusions were effectively impossible.&lt;ref name = "Charatan 2006 a"&gt;{{Harvnb|Charatan|2006}}. The quote is of [[Lynn Goldman]], who chaired the IOM committee that carried out the review.&lt;p&gt;{{Harvnb|Iversen|Chalder|Wessely|2007}} notes that "despite clear evidence of an increase in symptom burden and a decrease in well being" among Gulf War veterans, "exhaustive clinical and laboratory based scientific research has failed to document many reproducible biomedical abnormalities in this group. Likewise, there has been no evidence of an increase in disease related mortality".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Wessely]] praised the IOM's review, and noted that, despite its central conclusion that no novel syndrome existed, its other findings made it "equally clear that service in the Gulf war&lt;!--not a typo; the article uses a lower case 'w'--&gt; did aversely affect health in some personnel".&lt;ref name = "Charatan 2006 b"&gt;{{Harvnb|Charatan|2006}}. The quote is of Wessely himself.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the lack of baseline data to guide analysis of the veterans' postwar health, because no detailed health screening was carried out when the veterans entered service, another major stumbling block with some studies, like the thousand-veteran one, is that the subjects are self-selected, rather than a random sample, making general conclusions impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coker|Bhatt|Blatchley|Graham|1999}}; {{Harvnb|Murphy|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased rates of [[immune system]] disorders and other wide-ranging symptoms, including chronic pain, fatigue and memory loss, have been reported in over one quarter of combat veterans of the 1991 [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses (2004) [http://www1.va.gov/rac-gwvi/docs/ReportandRecommendations_2004.pdf "Scientific Progress in Understanding Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses: Report and Recommendations"]&lt;/ref&gt; Combustion products&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Murphy|Greenberg|Bland|2009}}: "Metallic DU is weakly radioactive and therefore contact with unbroken skin is an extremely low risk to health. However, when a DU round strikes an armoured target, it undergoes spontaneous partial combustion resulting in a fine aerosol of largely insoluble uranium oxides. Presence of this aerosol elevates the risk of potentially chemotoxic or radiotoxic exposure via inhalation or ingestion".&lt;/ref&gt; from depleted uranium munitions are being considered{{needs update|date=August 2015}} as one of the potential causes by the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, as DU was used in 30&amp;nbsp;mm and 25&amp;nbsp;mm cannon rounds on a large scale for the first time in the Gulf War.

[[File:DoD Environmental Uranium Gulf.jpg|thumb|upright|Excerpt from a 1998 evaluation of environmental exposure to depleted uranium in the Persian Gulf by the US Department of Defense]]
The U.S. Army has commissioned ongoing research into potential risks of depleted uranium and other projectile weapon materials like tungsten, which the U.S. Navy has used in place of DU since 1993. Studies by the U.S. Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute conclude that moderate exposures to either depleted uranium or uranium present a significant [[toxicology|toxicological]] threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/mcclain_NATO_2005.pdf |title=Status of Health Concerns about Military Use of Depleted Uranium and Surrogate Metals in Armor-Penetrating Munitions |author1=D.

In 2003, Professor Brian Spratt FRS, chairman of the [[Royal Society]]'s working group on depleted uranium, said: "The question of who carries out the initial monitoring and clean-up is a political rather than scientific question," and "[[Multinational force in Iraq|the coalition]] needs to acknowledge that depleted uranium is a potential hazard and make in-roads into tackling it by being open about where and how much depleted uranium has been deployed."&lt;ref name="gaurdian2003" /&gt;

A 2008 review of all relevant articles appearing in the peer-reviewed journals on [[MEDLINE]] through to the end of 2007, including multiple cohort studies of veterans, found no consistent evidence of excess risks of [[neoplasms]] that could have some link to DU, and that "[t]he overall incidence of cancers is not increased in the cohort studies of Gulf war and Balkans veterans".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lagorio|Grande|Martina|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though a more comprehensive assessment is possible, a 2011 update on a cancer scare regarding Italian soldiers who had served in the Balkans found lower than expected incidence rates for all cancers, a finding "consistent with lacking evidence of an increased cancer incidence among troops of other countries deployed in the areas of Iraq, Bosnia, and Kosovo, where armour-penetrating depleted uranium shells have been used."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peragallo|Urbano|Sarnicola|Lista|2011}}: "[T]he excess of reported cases for this malignancy [lymphoma] in 2001–2002 was probably due to a peak that occurred in 2000 among the whole military; it is therefore unrelated to deployment in the Balkans, and probably represents a chance event."&lt;/ref&gt;

One particular subgroup of veterans that may be at higher risk comprises those who have internally retained fragments of DU from shrapnel wounds. A laboratory study on rats produced by the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute showed that, after a study period of 6 months, rats treated with depleted uranium coming from implanted pellets, comparable to the average levels in the urine of [[Desert Storm]] veterans with retained DU fragments, had developed a significant tendency to lose weight with respect to the control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/pellmar.pdf |title=Toxicological Evaluation of Depleted Uranium in Rats: Six Month Evaluation Point |author1=T.

Substantial amounts of uranium were accumulating in their [[Human brain|brains]] and [[central nervous system]]s, and showed a significant reduction of [[neurone|neuronal]] activity in the [[hippocampus]] in response to external stimuli. The conclusions of the study show that brain damage from chronic uranium intoxication is possible at lower doses than previously thought. Results from computer-based neurocognitive tests performed in 1997 showed an association between uranium in the urine and "problematic performance on automated tests assessing performance efficiency and accuracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bordujenko|first= A.|date=September 2002|url= http://www.defence.gov.au/health/infocentre/journals/ADFHJ_sep02/ADFHealth_3_2_50-57.pdf | title=Military medical aspects of depleted uranium munitions|journal=ADF Health|publisher=Australian Defence Forces|volume = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraqi population===
Since 2001, medical personnel at the [[Basra]] hospital in [[southern Iraq]] have reported a sharp increase in the incidence of child leukemia and genetic malformation among babies born in the decade following the Gulf War.

A medical survey, "[[Cancer]], [[Infant Mortality]] and Birth [[Human sex ratio|Sex Ratio]] in [[Fallujah]], Iraq 2005–2009" published in July 2010, states that the "…increases in cancer and [[birth defects]]…are alarmingly high" and that infant mortality 2009/2010 has reached 13.6%.

[[File:Kosovo uranium NATO bombing1999.png|thumb|Sites in [[Kosovo]] and southern Central [[Serbia]] where NATO aviation used depleted uranium during the 1999 [[Kosovo War]].]]
In 2001, the [[World Health Organization]] reported that data from [[Kosovo]] was inconclusive and called for further studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/entity/ionizing_radiation/pub_meet/en/Report_WHO_depleted_uranium_Eng.pdf Report of the WHO's Depleted Uranium Mission to Kosovo (pdf 123kb)] January 22–31, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] stated that low levels of contaminant were found in drinking water and air particulate at DU penetrator impact points. The levels were stated as not a cause for alarm. Yet, [[Pekka Haavisto]], chairman of the UNEP DU projects stated, "The findings of this study stress again the importance of appropriate clean-up and civil protection measures in a post-conflict situation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040411033334/http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=298&amp;ArticleID=3926&amp;l=en Low-level DU contamination found in Bosnia and Herzegovina, UNEP calls for precaution] ''United Nations Environment Programme'', 25 March 2003. Retrieved 25 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of Italian scientists from the [[University of Siena]] reported in 2005 that, although DU was "clearly" added to the soil in the study area, "the phenomenon was very limited spatially and the total uranium concentrations fell within the natural range of the element in soils. Moreover, the absolute uranium concentrations indicate that there was no contamination of the earthworm species studied."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Di Lella|Nannoni|Protano|Riccobono|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contamination as a result of the Afghan War===
The Canadian Uranium Medical Research Centre obtained urine samples from bombed civilian areas in [[Jalalabad]] that showed concentrations of 80–400&amp;nbsp;ng/L of undepleted uranium, far higher than the typical concentration in the British population of ≈5&amp;nbsp;ng/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Durakovic | first1 = A. | year = 2005 | title = The Quantitative Analysis of Uranium Isotopes in the Urine of the Civilian Population of Eastern Afghanistan after Operation Enduring Freedom | url = | journal = Military Medicine | volume = 170 | issue = 4| pages = 277–284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies indicating negligible effects===
Studies in 2005 and earlier have concluded that DU ammunition has no measurable detrimental health effects.

A 1999 [[literature review]] conducted by the [[Rand Corporation]] stated: "No evidence is documented in the literature of cancer or any other negative health effect related to the radiation received from exposure to depleted or natural uranium, whether inhaled or ingested, even at very high doses,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/library/randrep/du/cover.html|title="A Review of the Scientific Literature as it Pertains to Gulf War Illnesses," Rand Report, 1999.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a RAND report authored by the U.S. Defense department undersecretary charged with evaluating DU hazards considered the debate to be more political than scientific.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard D. Rostker]] [https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P8066/ Depleted Uranium, A Case Study of Good and Evil]. RAND Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 [[oncology]] study concluded that "the present scientific consensus is that DU exposure to humans, in locations where DU ammunition was deployed, is very unlikely to give rise to [[cancer induction]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[IAEA]] reported in 2003 that, "based on credible scientific evidence, there is no proven link between DU exposure and increases in human cancers or other significant health or environmental impacts," although "Like other [[heavy metals]], DU is potentially poisonous. In sufficient amounts, if DU is ingested or inhaled it can be harmful because of its chemical toxicity. High concentration could cause kidney damage." The IAEA concluded that, while depleted uranium is a potential [[carcinogen]], there is no evidence that it has been carcinogenic in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Features/DU/faq_depleted_uranium.shtml|title=IAEA Depleted Uranium Factsheet|accessdate=|date=|year=|publisher=|pages=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318003818/http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Features/DU/faq_depleted_uranium.shtml|archivedate=18 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study by [[Sandia National Laboratory|Sandia National Laboratories']] Al Marshall used mathematical models to analyze potential health effects associated with accidental exposure to depleted uranium during the 1991 Gulf War. Marshall's study concluded that the reports of cancer risks from DU exposure are not supported by his analysis nor by veteran medical statistics. Marshall also examined possible genetic effects due to radiation from depleted uranium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandia.gov/news-center/news-releases/2005/def-nonprolif-sec/snl-dusand.pdf An Analysis of Uranium Dispersal and Health Effects Using a Gulf War Case Study] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204035816/http://www.sandia.gov/news-center/news-releases/2005/def-nonprolif-sec/snl-dusand.pdf |date=4 February 2012 }}, Albert C. Marshall, Sandia National Laboratories&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical effects, including potential reproductive issues, associated with depleted uranium exposure were discussed in some detail in a subsequent journal paper.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A. C. Gulf war depleted uranium risks Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology 18, 95–108 (January 2008) | {{doi|10.1038/sj.jes.7500551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmospheric contamination as a result of military actions===
Elevated radiation levels consistent with very low level atmospheric depleted uranium contamination have been found in air samples taken by the UK Atomic Weapons Establishment at several monitoring sites in Britain. These elevated readings appear to coincide with [[Operation Anaconda]] in Afghanistan, and the [[Shock and Awe]] bombing campaign at the start of the Second Gulf War.&lt;ref name="unidir.org"&gt;[http://www.unidir.org/pdf/articles/pdf-art2759.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321184057/http://www.unidir.org/pdf/articles/pdf-art2759.pdf |date=21 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Busby and S. Morgan, 2006, Did the Use of Uranium Weapons in Gulf War 2 Result in Contamination of Europe? Evidence from the Measurements of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, Aldermaston,
Aberystwyth, Green Audit.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other contamination cases===
On 4 October 1992, an [[El Al]] [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-F]] cargo aircraft ([[El Al Flight 1862|Flight 1862]]) crashed into an apartment building in [[Amsterdam]]. Local residents and rescue workers complained of various unexplained health issues, which were being attributed to the release of hazardous materials during the crash and subsequent fires. Authorities conducted an epidemiological study in 2000 of those believed to be affected by the accident. The study concluded that there was no evidence to link depleted uranium (used as counterbalance weights on the elevators of the plane) to any of the reported health complaints.&lt;ref name="Uijt de Haag P.A. and Smetsers R.C. and Witlox H.W. and Krus H.W. and Eisenga A.H. 2000"/&gt;

=== Safety and environmental issues ===

About 95% of the depleted uranium produced until now is stored as [[uranium hexafluoride]], (D)UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, in steel cylinders in open air yards close to enrichment plants. Each cylinder contains up to 12.7 tonnes (or 14 US tons) of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. In the U.S. alone, 560,000 tonnes of depleted UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; had accumulated by 1993. In 2005, 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near [[Portsmouth, Ohio]], [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and [[Paducah, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The long-term storage of DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; presents environmental, health, and safety risks because of its chemical instability. When UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is exposed to moist air, it reacts with the water in the air and produces UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (uranyl fluoride) and HF (hydrogen fluoride), both of which are highly soluble and toxic. Storage cylinders must be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks. The estimated lifetime of the steel cylinders is measured in decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieer.org/sdafiles/vol_5/5-2/deararj.html|title=» Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship (Vol. 5, No. 2)|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

 | accessdate = 21 August 2013
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The vulnerability of DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; storage cylinders to terrorist attack is apparently not the subject of public reports. However, the U.S. government has been converting DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to solid uranium oxides for disposal.&lt;ref&gt;

 | date = 
 | accessdate = 21 August 2013

&lt;/ref&gt;
Disposing of the whole DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; inventory could cost anywhere from 15 to 450 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;

{{History of Korea}}

The '''Division of Korea''' began at the end of [[World War II]] in 1945. With the defeat of [[Japan]], the [[Soviet Union]] occupied the north of Korea, and the [[United States]] occupied the south, with the boundary between their zones being the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]].

With the onset of the [[Cold War]], negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union failed to lead to an independent and unified Korea. In 1948, [[South Korean Constitutional Assembly election, 1948|UN-supervised elections]] were held in the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|US-occupied south]] only. [[Syngman Rhee]] won the election while [[Kim Il-sung]] was appointed as the leader of North Korea. This led to the establishment of the Republic of Korea in South Korea, which was promptly followed by the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in North Korea. The United States supported the South, the Soviet Union supported the North, and each government claimed sovereignty over the whole Korean peninsula.

The subsequent [[Korean War]], which lasted from 1950 to 1953, ended with a [[Korean Armistice Agreement|stalemate]] and has left the two Koreas separated by the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) up to the present day. Diplomatic initiatives have so far failed to end the division.

==Historical background==
===Japanese rule (1910–1945)===
{{Main|Korea under Japanese rule}}
When the [[Russo-Japanese War]] ended in 1905 Korea became a nominal [[protectorate]] of Japan, and was annexed by Japan in 1910. The Korean Emperor [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]] was removed. In the following decades, nationalist and radical groups emerged, mostly in exile, to struggle for independence. Divergent in their outlooks and approaches, these groups failed to unite in one national movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |pp=31–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| authorlink = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W.

===World War II===

[[File:건국준비위원회.jpg|thumb|[[Lyuh Woon-hyung]] giving a speech in the Committee for Preparation of Korean Independence in [[Seoul]] on August 16, 1945|left]]
At the [[Cairo Conference]] in November 1943, in the middle of World War Two, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]], [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] agreed that Japan should lose all the territories it had conquered by force. At the end of the conference, the three powers declared that they were, "mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea, ... determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent."&lt;ref name="cairo_communique"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/shiryo/01/002_46/002_46tx.html|publisher=Japan National Diet Library|title=Cairo Communique, December 1, 1943|date=December 1, 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Savada"&gt;{{citation | url = http://countrystudies.us/south-korea/8.htm | chapter = World War II and Korea | editor1-first = Andrea Matles | editor1-last = Savada | editor2-first = William | editor2-last = Shaw | title = South Korea: A Country Study | location = Washington, DC | series = GPO | publisher = Library of Congress | year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt floated the idea of a [[trusteeship]] over Korea, but did not obtain agreement from the other powers. Roosevelt raised the idea with [[Joseph Stalin]] at the [[Tehran Conference]] in November 1943 and the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945. Stalin did not disagree, but advocated that the period of trusteeship be short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| authorlink = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W.

At the Tehran and Yalta Conferences, Stalin promised to join his [[Allies of World War II|allies]] in the [[Pacific War]] in two to three months after [[Victory in Europe Day|victory in Europe]]. On August 8, 1945, three months to the day after the end of hostilities in Europe, and two days after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, the Soviet Union [[Soviet–Japanese War|declared war on Japan]].&lt;ref name = "Walker"&gt;{{cite book | last = Walker | first =  J Samuel | title = Prompt and Utter Destruction: Truman and the Use of Atomic Bombs Against Japan | publisher = The University of North Carolina Press | year = 1997 | location = Chapel Hill | page = 82 | isbn = 978-0-8078-2361-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As war began, the Commander-in-Chief of Soviet Forces in the Far East, Marshal [[Aleksandr Vasilevsky]], called on Koreans to rise up against Japan, saying "a banner of liberty and independence is rising in Seoul".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/11/how-kim-il-sung-became-north-koreas-great-leader|title=How Kim Il Sung became North Korea’s Great Leader|first=Fyodor|last=Tertitskiy|publisher=NK News|date=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet troops advanced rapidly, and the US government became anxious that they would occupy the whole of Korea. On August 10, 1945 two young officers – [[Dean Rusk]] and [[Charles Bonesteel]] – were assigned to define an American occupation zone. Working on extremely short notice and completely unprepared, they used a ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' map to decide on the 38th parallel. They chose it because it divided the country approximately in half but would place the capital [[Seoul]] under American control. No experts on Korea were consulted. The two men were unaware that forty years before, Japan and pre-revolutionary [[Russian Empire|Russia]] had discussed sharing Korea along the same parallel. Rusk later said that had he known, he "almost surely" would have chosen a different line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1= Oberdorfer| first1=Don| last2=Carlin| first2=Robert | title=The Two Koreas: A Contemporary History | publisher = Basic Books| year = 2014 | page = 5 | isbn = 9780465031238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The division placed sixteen million Koreans in the American zone and nine million in the Soviet zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the surprise of the Americans, the Soviet Union immediately accepted the division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/11/how-kim-il-sung-became-north-koreas-great-leader|title=How Kim Il Sung became North Korea’s Great Leader|first=Fyodor|last=Tertitskiy|publisher=NK News|date=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book |author= Hyung Gu Lynn |date= 2007 |title= Bipolar Orders: The Two Koreas since 1989 |publisher= Zed Books |p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was incorporated into [[General Order No. 1]] (approved on 17 August 1945) for the surrender of Japan.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book |author= Hyung Gu Lynn |date= 2007 |title= Bipolar Orders: The Two Koreas since 1989 |publisher= Zed Books |p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet forces began amphibious landings in Korea by August 14 and rapidly took over the north-east of the country, and on August 16 they landed at [[Wonsan]].&lt;ref&gt;

General [[Abe Nobuyuki]], the last Japanese [[Governor-General of Korea]], had established contact with a number of influential Koreans since the beginning of August 1945 to prepare the hand-over of power. Throughout August, Koreans organized people's committee branches for the "Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence" (CPKI, 조선건국준비위원회), led by [[Lyuh Woon-hyung]], a left-wing politician. On September 6, 1945, a congress of representatives was convened in Seoul and founded the short-lived [[People's Republic of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |pp=53–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Korea's Twentieth-Century Odyssey | last = Robinson | first = Michael E | year = 2007 | publisher = University of Hawaii Press |  location = Honolulu | isbn = 978-0-8248-3174-5 |pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spirit of consensus, conservative elder statesman [[Syngman Rhee]], who was living in exile in the US, was nominated as President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/08/why-russian-plans-for-austria-style-unification-in-korea-did-not-become-a-reality|title=Why Soviet plans for Austria-style unification in Korea did not become a reality|first=Fyodor|last=Tertitskiy|publisher=NK News|date=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post–World War II==
[[File:Anti-Trusteeship Campaign.jpg|thumb|South Korean citizens protest Allied trusteeship in December 1945]]

In December 1945, at the [[Moscow Conference (1945)|Moscow Conference]], the Allies agreed that the Soviet Union, the US, the Republic of China, and Britain would take part in a [[United Nations Trust Territories|trusteeship]] over Korea for up to five years in the lead-up to independence. Many Koreans demanded independence immediately; however, the [[Communist Party of Korea|Korean Communist Party]], which was closely aligned with the Soviet Communist party, supported the trusteeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea| last = Bluth | first = Christoph | year = 2008| publisher = Polity Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-07456-3357-2 |p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalist Fyodor Tertitskiy, documentation from 1945 suggests the Soviet government had no plans for a permanent division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/08/why-russian-plans-for-austria-style-unification-in-korea-did-not-become-a-reality|title=Why Soviet plans for Austria-style unification in Korea did not become a reality|first=Fyodor|last=Tertitskiy|publisher=NK News|date=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Soviet-US Joint Commission met in 1946 and 1947 to work towards a unified administration, but failed to make progress due to increasing [[Cold War]] antagonism and to Korean opposition to the trusteeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |pp=59–60, 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, the Soviet Union proposed [[Lyuh Woon-hyung]] as the leader of a unified Korea, but this was rejected by the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/08/why-russian-plans-for-austria-style-unification-in-korea-did-not-become-a-reality|title=Why Soviet plans for Austria-style unification in Korea did not become a reality|first=Fyodor|last=Tertitskiy|publisher=NK News|date=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the division between the two zones deepened. The difference in policy between the occupying powers led to a polarization of politics, and a transfer of population between North and South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Korea's Twentieth-Century Odyssey | last = Robinson | first = Michael E | year = 2007 | publisher = University of Hawaii Press |  location = Honolulu | isbn = 978-0-8248-3174-5 |pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1946 it was made illegal to cross the 38th parallel without a permit.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book |author= Hyung Gu Lynn |date= 2007 |title= Bipolar Orders: The Two Koreas since 1989 |publisher= Zed Books |p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the final meeting of the Joint Commission in September 1947, Soviet delegate [[Terentii Shtykov]] proposed that both Soviet and US troops withdraw and give the Korean people the opportunity to form their own government.

===US occupation of South Korea===
{{Main|United States Army Military Government in Korea}}
With the American government fearing Soviet expansion, and the Japanese authorities in Korea warning of a power vacuum, the embarkation date of the US occupation force was brought forward three times.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; On September 7, 1945, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] announced that Lieutenant General [[John R. Hodge]] was to administer Korean affairs, and Hodge landed in [[Incheon]] with his troops the next day. The [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]], which had operated from China, sent a delegation with three interpreters to Hodge, but he refused to meet with them.&lt;ref name="Hart-Landsberg 1998 71–77"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hart-Landsberg |first=Martin |title=Korea: Division, Reunification, &amp; U.S. Foreign Policy |year=1998 |publisher=Monthly Review Press |pages=71–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Hodge refused to recognize the newly formed [[People's Republic of Korea]] and its People's Committees, and outlawed it on 12 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1946, [[Autumn Uprising of 1946|thousands of laborers and peasants rose up]] against the military government. This uprising was quickly defeated, and failed to prevent scheduled October elections for the South Korean Interim Legislative Assembly.

The ardent anti-communist [[Syngman Rhee]], who had been the first president of the Provisional Government and later worked as a pro-Korean lobbyist in the US, became the most prominent politician in the South. Rhee pressured the American government to abandon negotiations for a trusteeship and create an independent Republic of Korea in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stueck |first=William W. |year=2002 |title=Rethinking the Korean War: A New Diplomatic and Strategic History |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0-691-11847-5|pp=49, 55–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 19, 1947, [[Lyuh Woon-hyung]], the last senior politician committed to left-right dialogue, was assassinated by a 19-year-old man named Han Chigeun, a recent refugee from North Korea and an active member of a nationalist right-wing group..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The occupation government conducted a number of military campaigns against left-wing insurgents. Over the course of the next few years, between 30,000&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Millet, ''The War for Korea, 1945–1950'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; and 100,000 people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Halliday and Bruce Cumings, ''Korea: The Unknown War'', Viking Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0-670-81903-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet occupation of North Korea===

When Soviet troops entered [[Pyongyang]], they found a local branch of the Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence operating under the leadership of veteran nationalist [[Cho Man-sik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Army allowed these "People's Committees" (which were friendly to the [[Soviet Union]]) to function. In September 1945, the Soviet administration issued its own currency, the "Red Army won".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/11/how-kim-il-sung-became-north-koreas-great-leader|title=How Kim Il Sung became North Korea’s Great Leader|first=Fyodor|last=Tertitskiy|publisher=NK News|date=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, Colonel-General [[Terentii Shtykov]] took charge of the administration and began to lobby the Soviet government for funds to support the ailing economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/11/how-kim-il-sung-became-north-koreas-great-leader|title=How Kim Il Sung became North Korea’s Great Leader|first=Fyodor|last=Tertitskiy|publisher=NK News|date=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1946 a [[provisional government]] called the Provisional People's Committee was formed under [[Kim Il-sung]], who had spent the last years of the war training with Soviet troops in [[Manchuria]]. Conflicts and power struggles ensued at the top levels of government in Pyongyang as different aspirants maneuvered to gain positions of power in the new government. In March 1946 the provisional government instituted a sweeping land-reform program: land belonging to Japanese and collaborator landowners was divided and redistributed to poor farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Korea's Twentieth-Century Odyssey | last = Robinson | first = Michael E | year = 2007 | publisher = University of Hawaii Press |  location = Honolulu | isbn = 978-0-8248-3174-5 |p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizing the many poor civilians and agricultural laborers under the people's committees, a nationwide mass campaign broke the control of the old landed classes. Landlords were allowed to keep only the same amount of land as poor civilians who had once rented their land, thereby making for a far more equal distribution of land. The North Korean land reform was achieved in a less violent way than [[Land reforms by country#China|in China]] or [[Land reform in North Vietnam|in Vietnam]]. Official American sources stated: "From all accounts, the former village leaders were eliminated as a political force without resort to bloodshed, but extreme care was taken to preclude their return to power."&lt;ref&gt;Cumings, Bruce. ''The Origins of the Korean War: Liberation and the Emergence of Separate Regimes, 1945–1947.'' Princeton University Press, 1981, 607 pages, {{ISBN|0-691-09383-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The farmers responded positively; many collaborators and former landowners fled to the south, where some of them obtained positions in the new South Korean government. According to the U.S. military government, 400,000 northern Koreans went south as refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Allan R. Millet, ''The War for Korea: 1945–1950'' (2005) p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Key industries were nationalized. The economic situation was nearly as difficult in the north as it was in the south, as the Japanese had concentrated agriculture in the south and heavy industry in the north.

Soviet forces departed in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;

With the failure of the Joint Commission to make progress, the US brought the problem before the [[United Nations]] in September 1947. The Soviet Union opposed UN involvement. At that time, the US had more influence over the UN than the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea since 1850 | last1 = Lone |  first1 = Stewart| last2 = McCormack | first2 = Gavan | authorlink2 = Gavan McCormack | publisher = Longman Cheshire | location = Melbourne | year = 1993 | pp=100–101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN passed a resolution on November 14, 1947, declaring that free elections should be held, foreign troops should be withdrawn, and a UN commission for Korea, the [[UNTCOK|United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea]] (UNTCOK), should be created. The Soviet Union boycotted the voting and did not consider the resolution to be binding, arguing that the UN could not guarantee fair elections. In the absence of Soviet co-operation, it was decided to hold UN-supervised elections in the south only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jager | first = Sheila Miyoshi| authorlink= Sheila Miyoshi Jager | title = Brothers at War – The Unending Conflict in Korea | year = 2013 | publisher = Profile Books | location = London | isbn = 978-1-84668-067-0|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in defiance of the report of the chairman of the Commission, [[K.

The decision to proceed with separate elections was unpopular among many Koreans, who rightly saw it as a prelude to a permanent division of the country. General strikes in protest against the decision began in February 1948.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; In April, [[Jeju Uprising|Jeju islanders rose up]] against the looming division of the country. South Korean troops were sent to repress the rebellion. Tens of thousands of islanders were killed and by one estimate, 70% of the villages were burned by the South Korean troops.&lt;ref name=nw000619&gt;{{cite news

In April 1948, a conference of organizations from the north and the south met in [[Pyongyang]]. The southern politicians [[Kim Koo]] and [[Kim Kyu-sik]] attended the conference and boycotted the elections in the south, as did other politicians and parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| authorlink = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W.

On May 10, 1948 the south held a [[South Korean Constitutional Assembly election, 1948|general election]]. It took place amid widespread violence and intimidation, as well as a boycott by opponents of Syngman Rhee.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite book|title = Korea: Where the American Century Began|last = Pembroke| first = Michael|year = 2018| publisher = Hardie Grant| location = Melbourne| isbn = 978-1-74379-393-0|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 15, the "[[South Korea|Republic of Korea]]" (''Daehan Minguk'') formally took over power from the U.S. military, with Syngman Rhee as the first president. In the North, the "[[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]]" (''Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk'') was declared on September 9, with Kim Il-sung as prime minister.

On December 12, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly accepted the report of UNTCOK and declared the Republic of Korea to be the "only lawful government in Korea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of the members of UNTCOK considered that the election had established a legitimate national parliament. The Australian government, which had a representative on the commission declared that it was "far from satisfied" with the election.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

Unrest continued in the South. In October 1948, the [[Yeosu–Suncheon Rebellion]] took place, in which some regiments rejected the suppression of the Jeju uprising and rebelled against the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/332032.html|title=439 civilians confirmed dead in Yeosu-Suncheon Uprising of 1948 New report by the Truth Commission places blame on Syngman Rhee and the Defense Ministry, advises government apology|publisher=[[The Hankyoreh]] |date=8 January 2009|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the Syngman Rhee government established the [[Bodo League massacre#Bodo League|Bodo League]] in order to keep an eye on its political opponents.

==Korean War==
{{Main|Korean War}}

This division of Korea, after more than a millennium of being unified, was seen as controversial and temporary by both regimes. From 1948 until the start of the civil war on June 25, 1950, the armed forces of each side engaged in a series of bloody conflicts along the border. In 1950, these conflicts escalated dramatically when North Korean forces invaded South Korea, triggering the [[Korean War]]. The United Nations intervened to protect the South, sending a US-led force. As it occupied the south, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea attempted to unify Korea under its regime, initiating the nationalisation of industry, land reform, and the restoration of the People's Committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea since 1850 | last1 = Lone |  first1 = Stewart| last2 = McCormack | first2 = Gavan | authorlink2 = Gavan McCormack | publisher = Longman Cheshire | location = Melbourne | year = 1993 | p=112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While UN intervention was conceived as restoring the border at the 38th parallel, Syngman Rhee argued that the attack of the North had obliterated the boundary. Similarly UN Commander in Chief, General Douglas MacArthur stated that he intended to unify Korea, not just drive the North Korean forces back behind the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stueck |first=William W. |year=2002 |title=Rethinking the Korean War: A New Diplomatic and Strategic History |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0-691-11847-5|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the North overran 90% of the south until a counter-attack by US-led forces. As the North Korean forces were driven from the south, South Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel on 1 October, and American and other UN forces followed a week later. This was despite warnings from the People's Republic of China that it would intervene if American troops crossed the parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stueck |first=William W. |year=2002 |title=Rethinking the Korean War: A New Diplomatic and Strategic History |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0-691-11847-5|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it occupied the north, the Republic of Korea, in turn, attempted to unify the country under its regime, with the Korean National Police enforcing political indoctrination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| authorlink = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-393-32702-1 |pp=281–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; As US-led forces pushed into the north, China unleashed a counter-attack which drove them back into the south.

In 1951, the front line stabilized near the 38th parallel, and both sides began to consider an armistice. Rhee, however, demanded the war continue until Korea was unified under his leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stueck |first=William W. |year=2002 |title=Rethinking the Korean War: A New Diplomatic and Strategic History |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0-691-11847-5|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist side supported an armistice line being based on the 38th parallel, but the United Nations supported a line based on the territory held by each side, which was militarily defensible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stueck |first=William W. |year=2002 |title=Rethinking the Korean War: A New Diplomatic and Strategic History |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0-691-11847-5|pp=139,180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN position, formulated by the Americans, went against the consensus leading up to the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Korea: Where the American Century Began|first=Michael|last=Pembroke|publisher=Hardie Grant Books|date=2018|pages=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the Americans proposed a line that passed through Pyongyang, far to the north of the front line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Korea: Where the American Century Began|first=Michael|last=Pembroke|publisher=Hardie Grant Books|date=2018|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese and North Koreans eventually agreed to a border on the military line of contact rather than the 38th parallel, but this disagreement led to a tortuous and drawn-out negotiating process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Korea: Where the American Century Began|first=Michael|last=Pembroke|publisher=Hardie Grant Books|date=2018|pages=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Armistice==
[[File:Korea at night.png|thumb|right|The division is clearly visible from space with a higher amount of light emitted into space from the South than the North]]

The [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] was signed after three years of war. The two sides agreed to create a four-kilometer-wide buffer zone between the states, known as the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ). This new border, reflecting the territory held by each side at the end of the war, crossed the 38th parallel diagonally. Rhee refused to accept the armistice and continued to urge the reunification of the country by force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stueck |first=William W. |year=2002 |title=Rethinking the Korean War: A New Diplomatic and Strategic History |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0-691-11847-5|pp=189–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite attempts by both sides to reunify the country, the war perpetuated the division of Korea and led to a permanent alliance between South Korea and the U.S., and a permanent U.S. garrison in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stueck |first=William W. |year=2002 |title=Rethinking the Korean War: A New Diplomatic and Strategic History |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0-691-11847-5|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As dictated by the terms of the Korean Armistice, a [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] was held in 1954 on the Korean question. Despite efforts by many of the nations involved, the conference ended without a declaration for a unified Korea.

The Armistice established a [[Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission]] (NNSC) which was tasked to monitor the Armistice. Since 1953, members of the Swiss&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/en/home/themen/einsaetze/peace/korea.parsys.0003.downloadList.53335.DownloadFile.tmp/nnsc2011e.pdf |title=NNSC in Korea |website=[[Military of Switzerland|Swiss Army]] |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829125634/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/en/home/themen/einsaetze/peace/korea.parsys.0003.downloadList.53335.DownloadFile.tmp/nnsc2011e.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Swedish&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/en/Forces-abroad/Korea-/ |title=Korea |website=[[Swedish Armed Forces]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825200823/http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/en/Forces-abroad/Korea-/ |archivedate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; armed forces have been members of the NNSC stationed near the DMZ.  Poland and Czechoslovakia were the neutral nations chosen by North Korea, but North Korea expelled their observers after those countries embraced capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pacific: The Ocean of the Future|first=Simon|last=Winchester|publisher=William Collins|date=2015|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-armistice relations==
{{main|Korean conflict|North Korea–South Korea relations}}
[[File:2018 inter-Korean summit square.jpg|thumb|Moon and Kim shaking hands over the [[demarcation line]]]]
Since the war, Korea has remained divided along the DMZ. North and South have remained in a state of conflict, with the opposing regimes both claiming to be the legitimate government of the whole country. Sporadic negotiations have failed to produce lasting progress towards reunification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/06/09/koreas_slow_motion_reunification/ |title=Korea's slow-motion reunification|publisher=Boston Globe|date=June 9, 2005|accessdate=2007-08-13|first1=John|last1=Feffer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 2018 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in met in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The [[Panmunjom Declaration]] signed by both leaders called for the end of longstanding military activities near the border and the reunification of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/04/27/the-panmmunjom-declaration-full-text-of-agreement-between-north-korea-and-south-korea/|title=The full text of North and South Korea’s agreement, annotated|first=Adam|last=Taylor|date=27 April 2018|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2018, [[buffer zone]]s were established across the DMZ to help ensure the end of hostility on land, sea and air.&lt;ref name=nov1&gt;http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2018/11/01/0200000000AEN20181101002500315.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nov1again /&gt; The buffer zones stretch from the north of Deokjeok Island to the south of Cho Island in the West Sea and the north of Sokcho city and south of Tongchon County in the East (Yellow) Sea.&lt;ref name=nov1again&gt;https://www.nknews.org/2018/10/two-koreas-end-military-drills-begin-operation-of-no-fly-zone-near-mdl-mnd/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nov1 /&gt; In addition, [[no fly zone]]s were established as well.&lt;ref name=nov1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nov1again /&gt;

'''Drinking And Driving Wrecks Lives''' is the [[tagline]] to a series of [[public information film]]s ('''PIFs''') that ran in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] between 1987 and 1997, addressing the problem of [[drink-driving]]. Unlike earlier campaigns which focused on consequences to the offender, this campaign was more aimed at showing the devastation that drink-driving can cause to the victims and their families. Storylines and camera techniques (such as the extreme close ups used in the ''Eyes'' and ''Kathy'' campaigns) were designed to encourage drinking drivers to identify with the people affected by this behaviour, showing that drink driving is not a "[[victimless crime]]". There were many PIFs in the series.

==PIFs==

''Note: This list is not complete yet.''

*'''Classmates''' - The first 'Drinking and Driving Wrecks Lives' PIF, from 1987. Depicting a class of children who lost one of their own classmates to a drunk driver. The camera is shown moving from the teacher to rows of children, each narrating their reactions to news of the boy's death, ending on a close friend of the deceased at the back of the class seated next to a now empty chair.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0jITVDEi4k&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mother''' (1988) - Depicting a mother who talks about how her daughter, Jenny, was injured in an accident caused by a drinking driver (and, it is implied, has been severely brain damaged.) The mother hopes that her daughter will be able to leave hospital one day, even though doctors have said she will not.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lps8-5h7XA&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''A Fireman's Tale''' - [[Ken Stott]] plays a fireman who talks to the camera about attending the scene of an accident where a mother and baby had been killed by a drinking driver.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1aQf_xNEcQ&lt;/ref&gt;
*''' Real Lives''' (1989) - This advert follows a family whose young son has recently died as a result of a drink driving accident. Newspaper clippings about the young boy's death is shown as well as his funeral, including his grieving family and younger brother. His parents are then shown clearing out what had been his bedroom, and they break down in tears as they find his watch. [[John Nettles]] narrated the introduction to this film.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mewFpQuaiNw&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Recovery''' - Depicts a man trying to teach himself how to walk after being left in a wheelchair after a crash. The film has him attempting to use handrails as his instructor encourages him, but about half-way he finds it too painful and asks to stop.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9--M3wzCj8s&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Victim''' - A more sedate example of the campaign from 1987, in which a paralysed man talks about the accident which took his mobility. He says his mates have looked after him and they believe he's lucky to be alive, and then he is fed a cup of coffee by his friend.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZEcckTJ5Bs&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Kathy Can't Sleep''' - From 1990, directed by Tony Kaye (American History X, The British Rail ads). The camera shows a little girl named Kathy watching while her mother shouts and rages at her father, who has been convicted of killing a child while driving under the influence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIYTPYHCI7E&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Police Station''' - A 1991 ad which tells the story from a drink-driver's point of view. It focuses on how intimidating the arrest is, and how frustrated the police come across in such a situation. At the end of the advert, a policeman informs the driver that a victim has died, and another policeman offers him a cup of tea in a clearly agitated manner.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcVH0n2DP3k&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Eyes''' - Another ad from 1992 in which [[Denise van Outen]] played a young girl who has been run over by an intoxicated driver. The camera focuses on her blank, lifeless eyes as an ambulance team attempt to revive her. At the end she is pronounced [[asystole|asystolic]], meaning her heart has stopped and death is likely imminent. 
*'''In the Summertime''' - a 1992 campaign devised to challenge popular misconception that [[driving under the influence|drink driving]] is only a serious problem at [[Christmas]], the usual time for anti-drink driving PIFs to be shown. With a soundtrack of the [[Mungo Jerry]] song "[[In the Summertime (Mungo Jerry song)|In the Summertime]]" (one of the lines of which is ''"Have a drink, have a drive..."''), a group of friends are drinking in the [[beer]] garden of a [[pub]] on a warm summer's evening. As a car departs from the pub, we see one pub-goer cease smiling after catching sight of something shocking. As the music suddenly slows down and dies away, the camera then focuses on the car which has run off the road and into a tree, killing the driver and his wife. The slightly different [[tagline]] was "In the summertime, drinking and driving wrecks even more lives".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr3CfhveC2U&lt;/ref&gt; The ad proved to be so popular that it was repeated in 1994, along with a print ad campaign.
*'''Christmas Pudding''' - An advert from 1993. A woman's Christmas dinner with her family is interrupted when the phone rings to inform her that her boyfriend (who had been drinking at another party) was killed on the road, and the burning [[Christmas pudding]] on the dinner table then turns into the wreckage of a burning car. Again, the slightly different [[tagline]] was; "Drinking and driving wrecks [[Christmas]]".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjDbtdrxMdE&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''One More, Dave''' - a 1995 Christmas advert where we see a woman in a kitchen liquidising Christmas dinner, with voices in the background of men in a pub encouraging their friend to have another drink. He refuses, saying that he is driving, but they urge him "Come on Dave, just one more." The woman is then seen feeding the liquid concoction to her now [[quadriplegic]] son (played by [[Daniel Ryan (actor)|Daniel Ryan]]), and when he can't swallow it, she encourages "Come on Dave, just one more".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kADUAXf7hOo&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mirror''' - From 1996, featuring a young woman sitting at a vanity table and staring into the mirror as she talks about being involved in an accident where her boyfriend, who had been drinking, crashed their car on the road. She says she would like to leave her boyfriend but doesn't think another man would want her, and turns her face to the light to show scarring resulting from the accident.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du2P6HqkhqY&lt;/ref&gt; This advert is traditionally considered as being part of the campaign, despite containing a completely different endline ("Enjoy a drink. Leave the car at home.").
*'''Mark''' - This advert shows a ghostly face of a man that talks about his best friend Mark, who is ostensibly "a great [[bloke]]" but after going on a night out and having "only a quick one", he caused an accident which killed a couple, leaving their children as orphans. It challenged public perceptions that you have to be drunk to cause a serious [[drink driving]] accident.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yVjGjSMv8&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mates''' - This ad is played from the perspective of a critically injured man whose friend was drink-driving. His friend is constantly asking how he is and claiming his innocence, then accepts his mistake and apologises, while medical staff are attempting to treat the man. The advert ends with the driver looking into the camera and saying "We're still mates, aren't we?"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQqXHGuxGfo&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign  was replaced in 1997 by a new slogan, "Have none for the road".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhg_4hA0GLw&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''drupa''' is the largest [[printing]] equipment exhibition in the world, held every four years by [[Messe Düsseldorf]] in Düsseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The word drupa is a [[portmanteau]] of the German words '''dru'''ck und '''pa'''pier; ''print'' and ''paper'' respectively.

Thousands of industry experts are usually present, and corporate representation typically includes companies such as [[Agfa-Gevaert|Agfa Graphics]], [[Océ|Océ N.V.]], [[Muller Martini]], [[EIZO (Eizo Nanao Corporation)|EIZO]], [[Esko (company)|Esko]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Xeikon]], [[Flint Group]], [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen]], [[Manroland]], Kern, [[Pitney Bowes]], New Solution, [[Xerox]], [[Kodak]], [[Canon (company)|Canon]], [[Transeomedia]], [[DirectSmile]], [[Konica Minolta]], [[Ricoh]], Martin Automatic, [[Komori Corporation]], [[Fujifilm]], [[Siegwerk]], [[Inspectron]] and [[Koenig &amp; Bauer AG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drupa.com/cgi-bin/md_drupa/vis/custom/ext2/download.cgi/drupa12.html?ticket=k-U2FsdGVkX18_oeQGWmm6hQ8t2nh20pcKul9JDbh0whQ&amp;dl=html |title=drupa 2012 Exhibitors |publisher=[[Messe Düsseldorf]] |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several new technologies are typically demonstrated during Drupa.

==Theme song==
Since 2000 every drupa had its own theme song. The idea started in 1986 with a song featuring a country folk style which was later nominated as one of the worst corporate anthems ever by ''[[The Register]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/28/anthem_poll/ |title=Vote now for the worst corporate anthem - ever! |publisher=[[The Register]] |accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, they are one of the drupa trademarks since the theme song concept was resurrected with a dance/pop power ballad in 2000. The drupa 2004 theme song used a techno dance style while the song for 2012 was performed by Dirk Zeisler.

A '''failure of imagination''' is a circumstance wherein something seemingly predictable (particularly from hindsight) and undesirable was not planned for.{{Clarify|date=September 2014|reason=IWhat does this mean?}}

The field of [[epistemology]] studies knowledge and human understanding, and failures of understanding.  Failure of imagination is related to [[unknown unknown]]s and [[black swan theory]], used by [[Nassim Taleb]] in his 2007 book [[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|The Black Swan]], describing unexpected or unpredicted incidents with significant negative impact, with [[Russell's teapot]] as counterpoint.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Intelligence failures of imagination and the 9/11 attacks ==

Failure of imagination is invoked as a reason that intelligence agencies, such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the [[NSA]], failed to prevent the [[September 11 attacks]].  More generally, the concept may also apply to the Presidency of George W. Bush and his administration, that failed to prevent the attacks.

During the summer of 2003, after the now-[[Classified information in the United States|declassified]] report about the September 11 attack, many government officials, such as [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Bob Graham]] began to make criticisms that the September 11 attack might have easily been predicted and even prevented.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/news/qa/2004/11/11_401.html Mother Jones interview with Graham]&lt;/ref&gt; Following these criticisms, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] declassified the August 6, 2001 [[President's Daily Brief]], ''[[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US]]'', which indicated that hijackings might be one possible mode of attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB116/index.htm National Security Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;
    
After the attacks, representatives of the Bush administration claimed in early 2004 that "nobody could have imagined that ... hijackers would intentionally crash ... hijackers usually want to live."&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/09/20020920-5.html White House briefing with Condoleezza Rice]&lt;/ref&gt; To the contrary, the apparently intentional crash of [[EgyptAir Flight 990]] by its co-pilot on December 31, 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntsb.gov/Publictn/2002/aab0201.htm NTSB report]&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar intentional crash of [[PSA Flight 1771]] by a disgruntled former airline employee on December 7, 1987,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/psa-flight-1771 Answers.com report]&lt;/ref&gt; and especially the case of [[Air France Flight 8969|AFR 8969]], offered precedents that indicated otherwise. Prior to the 9/11 attacks, a number of foreign nationals were taking pilot training in the U.S. and raised suspicion by being uninterested in learning how to land safely. The [[9/11 Commission]] found that this failure to "connect the dots" and imagine what was being planned was an important contributing factor to the [[September 11 attacks]], stating "the most important failure [concerning the 9/11 attacks] was one of imagination."&lt;ref name=commission&gt;{{cite web| title=Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States: Executive Summary| url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Exec.htm| publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States| accessdate=2009-09-20| date=2004-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accidents related failures of imagination ==
Failure of imagination has also been invoked in regards to the [[Apollo 1]] fire by astronaut [[Frank Borman]] in 1967 when he spoke at the Apollo 1 investigation hearings (dramatized in the HBO mini-series ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (TV miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' in 1998). It has also been mentioned in reference to  design flaws in the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. [[Donald Rumsfeld]], in the documentary [[The Unknown Known]] suggests that the failure of the United States to anticipate the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] was a failure of imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2390962/|title=The Unknown Known}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federation of Conservative Students''' (FCS) was the [[Student society|student organisation]] of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] from the late 1940s to 1986. It was created to act as a bridge between the student movement and the Conservative Party. In its final years it became known colloquially as "[[Maggie's Militant Tendency]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/students/news/story/0,,1058776,00.html |title=Tory youth group accused of take-over plot |author=Happold, Tom |newspaper=The Guardian Unlimited |date=8 October 2003 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to then Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] and to [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]], an [[Entryism|entryist]] group active in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] at the time. The FCS was then broken up by the [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]], [[Norman Tebbit]], after one of its members had accused previous former Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] of war crimes in extraditing [[Cossacks]] to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="John Stevens 9"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yapWAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4507,3865568|title=Tories sue student editor over Macmillan war crimes charges|author=John Stevens|work=Sydney Morning Herald|page=9|date=21 August 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCS was replaced by the [[Conservative Collegiate Forum]].

==History==
The organisation was created in the late 1940s to act as a bridge between the student movement and the Conservative Party, It was initially named the Federation of University Conservative and Unionists Associations (FUCUA). By the late 1970s the organisation had moved considerably left of the Conservative party.&lt;ref name=Phibbs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/001216.php |title=FCS twenty years on – Harry Phibbs remembers his days in the Federation of Conservative Students |author=Phibbs, Harry |date=30 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paradigm shift===
The policies of [[Margaret Thatcher]] had a polarising effect on British politics and the student left moved towards radicalism in their response to them. Many students' unions would pass motions instituting a policy of "No Platform for Racists or Fascists". Starting in the early 1980s, the organisation adopted a more confrontational approach toward the left-leaning [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]]. Leaders, most notably from [[Scotland]], started advocating "voluntary students' unions". They organised campaigns aimed at disaffiliating individual students' unions from the NUS to weaken the so-called block vote, and deprive it of taxpayers' money which the NUS used for various causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.no2nus.co.uk/index2.html |title=No2NUS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929230613/http://www.no2nus.co.uk/index2.html |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Posters and other publicity material became much more provocative and hard-hitting.&lt;ref name=Phibbs/&gt;

===Factionalism===
In the early years FCS was moderate in its outlook and elected a number of National Chairmen reflecting a mainstream outlook. These included [[Mark Carlisle]] MP, [[Andrew Neil]] and [[Antony Buck]] MP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=09:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00774n5 |title=BBC Desert Island Discs Interview 2007 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2007-03-02 |accessdate=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the 1970s saw increasing factionalism mirroring the internal conflicts between [[Monday Club]] supporters of [[Enoch Powell]] and the Heathite leadership.   In its last years, the FCS, perhaps reflecting the debate within the Conservative party of the 1980s and the generally fractious nature of student politics, was notably prone to [[Political faction|factionalism]].  The three main factions were:
*  An [[authoritarian]] faction
*  A [[libertarianism|libertarian]], or "sound", faction
*  A [[moderates|moderate]] faction, known to the other factions as "wet"

====Authoritarians====
The authoritarian faction centred on the student [[Monday Club]], and was known for its more traditional British nationalism, an isolationist posture in relation to foreign affairs, opposition (as espoused by [[Enoch Powell]]) to immigration, scepticism about liberal economics, and staunch support for the Union.&lt;ref name="forum"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ferris.edu/ISAR/archives/genewar/ritenow.htm |title=Right Now! A forum for eugenecists |newspaper=[[Searchlight magazine]] |date=July 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118203615/http://www.ferris.edu/isar/archives/genewar/ritenow.htm |archivedate=18 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libertarians====
The Libertarian faction (the "Libs") was closely linked to the [[Libertarian Alliance]] run by [[Chris Tame]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,1746779,00.html |  title=Chris Tame |author=Glendening, Marc |newspaper=The Guardian |date=5 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Adam Smith Institute]], run by [[Madsen Pirie]].&lt;ref name=Phibbs/&gt;

The libertarian faction was the largest faction in the FCS in its last few years. Its overall dominance is illustrated by the passage of a libertarian motion in favour of [[free migration]] at the [[Leicester]] conference, shortly before the demise of the FCS, which was opposed by both the wet and the authoritarian factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://conservativehome.blogs.com/torydiary/2006/07/the_federation_.html |title=The Federation of Conservative Students – Tory Diary |publisher=[[ConservativeHome]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Glendening, elected Chairman in 1984, the FCS became more controversial than ever as it embraced social liberalism in addition to the already established endorsement of economic libertarianism; issues such as supporting the legalisation of drugs were no longer taboo.&lt;ref name=Phibbs/&gt;

Many former leaders of the libertarian faction, such as [[Mark MacGregor]], went on to hold senior office in the Conservative Party. Other notable members of "the Libs" were: [[Brian Monteith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article542916.ece |title=Tory turmoil as Monteith leaves post |author=Macleod, Angus |newspaper=The Times |date=12 July 2005 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd Beat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/evening-news-edinburgh-scotland/mi_7832/is_2000_August_16/scottish-tory-candidate-hanged/ai_n32823294/ | work=Evening News | title=Former Scottish Tory candidate found hanged | date=16 August 2000 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marc-Henri Glendening, Marc Gordon, Mark Allatt, [[Robbie Gibb]], Adrian Lee, Steve Nicholson, Douglas Smith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article1639228.ece |title=New Model Tories: Tory tribes |newspaper=The Independent |date=24 September 2006 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706193055/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article1639228.ece |archivedate=6 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1144426.ece  |title=Top Tory aide is king of the urban swingers |author=Elliot, John |newspaper=The Sunday Times |date=22 June 2003 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Hoile,&lt;ref name=hoile&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/diary/story/0,,558760,00.html | title=Diary |author=Hyde, Marina |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent 24 June 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last= McSmith |first= Andy | authorlink= |title= Our Man in Westminster: Former anti-Mandela camp is silent – in case its members hang themselves |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/our-man-in-westminster-former-anti-mandela-camp-is-silent-in-case-its-members-hang-themselves-8672121.html| date= 24 June 2013 |newspaper= [[The Independent]] |location=London| accessdate= 22 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Harry Phibbs.&lt;ref name="tory boy"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,,1365643,00.html |title=The curse of Tory Boy |author=[[Jo-Anne Nadler|Nadler, Jo-Anne]] |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 December 2004 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Bercow]] and [[Andrew Rosindell]] were once also members, although they had also been part of the authoritarian faction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/conservatives/story/0,,829851,00.html | title=The most expensive MP at Westminster |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Moderates====
The Moderate faction had controlled the FCS until 1980. Some of them were members of the [[Tory Reform Group]] (TRG). Eight prominent members of the moderate faction including several former chairmen joined the SDP in 1981.&lt;ref name=Phibbs/&gt;

Despite a relatively high number of supporters and control of some large student bodies, they only once gained influence in the national federation after 1980, through a controversial last minute alliance with the authoritarian faction in 1983.

The moderate faction was usually referred to by its opponents as the "Wets" in an allusion to the contemporary nickname for the anti-Thatcherite wing of the parliamentary party, although after 1980 this description was often vehemently rejected{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} by members of the moderate faction in FCS themselves in favour of titles such as the "Party Faction"{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} and "Conservative Student Unionists." This was partly because they saw themselves as seeking to represent the mainstream of the party and not just the left, and partly because this faction did contain a significant proportion of prominent members such as [[Paul Goodman (politician)| Paul Goodman]] and [[Mark Francois]]{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} who later became MPs perceived to be to the right of the party leadership.

In many universities the TRG organised itself as a complementary political society to the main Conservative group.  This is a policy that the TRG has maintained since, although the last of these societies, the Oxford TRG Society, merged with [[Oxford University Conservative Association|Oxford's Conservative Association]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cherwell.org/archive/2007/11/28/outrg-merges-with-ouca |title=OUTRG merges with OUCA |accessdate=26 June 2013 |author=Wisnom, Selena |date=28 November 2007 |publisher=Cherwell }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Political stance===
In the 1980s the FCS was noted for being more radical than the main party, more [[Thatcherism|Thatcherite]] than [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] – ministers invited to speak at conferences were routinely chastised for not going far enough.&lt;ref name=Phibbs/&gt;

In addition to supporting privatisation, controversial positions embraced included the support for [[Grenada#History 1958-1984: Independence and Revolution|American intervention in Grenada]], [[Mozambican National Resistance|RENAMO]], the [[UNITA]] rebels in [[Angola]], and the [[Contras]] in Nicaragua.&lt;ref name="tory boy"/&gt; The Federation made badges with the words "Nicaragua Must be Free". Some [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] students began wearing them without realising their origin and intended meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Jo-Anne Nadler|Nadler, Jo-Anne]] |title=Too Nice to be a Tory: It's My Party and I'll Cry If I Want To |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2CIbvgUrukC&amp;pg=PA81 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, 2004 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCS also 'famously' produced a poster saying 'Hang Nelson Mandela', and criticized Thatcher for her 'soft touch'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nagle|first1=Angela|title=Kill All Normies|publisher=Zero Books|isbn=9781785355448|pages=29|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/reader.action?docID=4867966&amp;query=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some delegates to the [[Loughborough]] conference wore T-shirts with the slogan "[[Morning Cloud]], remember the [[ARA General Belgrano|Belgrano]]". In October 1985 they were accused of physically intimidating [[Edward Heath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Denham |first1=Andrew |last2=Garnett |first2=Mark |title=Keith Joseph |publisher=Acumen |year=2002 |page=434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged riot at Loughborough University===
There was some damage during the 1985 FCS conference at [[Loughborough University]], leading to press reports of a "riot". The officers elected at that conference were mainly of the libertarian faction who espouse many of the controversial libertarian ideals which have embarrassed the party leadership.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite book |author=Evans, Timothy |title=Conservative Radicalism: A Sociology of Conservative Party Youth Structures and Libertarianism 1970–1992 |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=1996 |page=36 (footnotes 107 and 108, citing the Daily Telegraph of 4 April 1985)|isbn=1-57181-872-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was clear that some damage was done, the so-called riot was vastly exaggerated,  the final bill for repairs that the University presented came to under £20, and there would not be enough evidence to close the FCS as the then Party Chairman [[John Gummer|John Selwyn Gummer]] wanted. Nevertheless, reports of "riots" in the media, including the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', motivated Gummer immediately to suspend the FCS's £30,000 annual grant.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that the "students cleared up the mess after the offending party, and journalists who saw the room the morning after reported a damaged door handle, a missing light bulb and beer stains on the carpet in a corridor to be the only visible signs of damage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=unknown title |author=Norman, Margot |page=37 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=6 April 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspector Patricia Perry of Loughborough Police Station said "there was no physical damage".{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In a letter to ''[[The Times]]'', Professor [[Peter Havard-Williams]] of Loughborough University stated "The damage itself was not more than that done by many other conferences and was not excessive."&lt;ref name="Times4Apr85"&gt;{{cite news |title=Letters to the Editor |newspaper=The Times |date=12 April 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark MacGregor]] suggested that Gummer's actions were politically motivated: "Unfortunately, many of our supporters will see this as a move against the leaders they have elected. Our supporters are from working-class backgrounds, and the party establishment seems to feel that we don't quite fit in."&lt;ref name="Times4Apr85" /&gt;

In ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Toby Young]] wrote: "As nights of mob terror go, last Monday's party at the Federation of Conservative Students' Conference was pretty tame".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Letters to the Editor |newspaper=The Observer |date=7 April 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Young and Sir [[Alfred Sherman]] believed that Gummer's actions were motivated by his opposition to the libertarian ideology of some of the FCS' members which closely resembled some of Mrs Thatcher's personal beliefs. Sherman wrote that Gummer's actions were "directed against the Prime Minister".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Letters to the Editor |newspaper=Sunday Times |date=14 April 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Hames]] and [[Nick Robinson (journalist)|Nick Robinson]] later admitted that the bill presented for damage was less than £20,&lt;ref name="BBCRad"&gt;{{cite news |title=A Burst of Freedom |author=Hames, Tim |newspaper=BBC Radio 4 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/audio/41953000/rm/_41953300_burst.ram}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the media reports were as a result of an "astute [[Spin (public relations)|spinning]] operation" by Wet delegates from the [[University of Oxford]], who "directed journalists to students who offered harrowing accounts of the boorish behaviour of libertarian activists."&lt;ref name="BBCRad"/&gt;

==Demise==
The FCS was disbanded by [[Norman Tebbit]], who succeeded Gummer as the [[Chairman of the Conservative Party|party chairman]]. This was for publishing an article, penned by [[Harry Phibbs]], following [[Nikolai Tolstoy]]'s accusation that former Conservative Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] was complicit in war crimes for his involvement in [[Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II|the forced repatriation]] of [[Cossack]] [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] to Soviet Russia in the aftermath of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="John Stevens 9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Phibbs/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2950">'''Fowler's solution''' is a solution containing 1% [[potassium arsenite]] (KAsO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and once prescribed as a remedy or a [[Pharmaceutical drug#For nutrition|tonic]].&lt;ref name=Jolliffe&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Jolliffe, D. M. | title = A history of the use of arsenicals in man | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | year = 1993 | volume = 86 | issue = 5 | pages = 287–289 | pmc = 1294007 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1294007/pdf/jrsocmed00098-0055.pdf | format = pdf | pmid=8505753}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas Fowler of [[Stafford]], England, proposed the solution in 1786 as a substitute for a [[patent medicine]], "tasteless [[fever|ague]] drop".  From 1845, Fowler's solution was a leukemia treatment.&lt;ref name=Jolliffe/&gt;

At 1905, inorganic arsenicals, like Fowler's solution, saw diminished use as attention turned to organic arsenicals, starting with [[Atoxyl]].&lt;ref name='ITOM'&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gibaud |first1=Stéphane |last2=Jaouen |first2=Gérard |title=Arsenic - based drugs: from Fowler’s solution to modern anticancer chemotherapy |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-13185-1_1 |journal=[https://www.springer.com/series/3418 Topics in Organometallic Chemistry] |year=2010 |volume=32 |pages=1–20  |doi= 10.1007/978-3-642-13185-1_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As arsenical compounds are notably toxic and [[carcinogen]]ic—with side effects such as [[cirrhosis of the liver]], [[idiopathic]] [[portal hypertension]], [[bladder cancer|urinary bladder cancer]], and [[skin cancer]]s—Fowler's solution fell from use.  (In 2001, however, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved a drug of [[arsenic trioxide]] to treat [[acute promyelocytic leukaemia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Zhu, J. |author2=Chen, Z. |author3=Lallemand-Breitenbach, V. |author4=de Thé, H. | title = How acute promyelocytic leukaemia revived arsenic | journal = [[Nature Reviews Cancer]] | year = 2002 | volume = 2 | issue = 9 | pages = 705–714 | doi = 10.1038/nrc887 | pmid = 12209159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and interest in arsenic has returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Chen, S.

'''Fred Astaire Dance Studios, Inc.''' is a [[ballroom dance]] [[Franchising|franchise]] chain of studios in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], named after and co-founded by famous dancer [[Fred Astaire]]. It is headquartered in [[Longmeadow, Massachusetts]], USA.

The company was co-founded by Astaire along with Charles and Chester Casanave in 1947. Astaire divested his interest in the chain in 1966, while agreeing the continued use of his name by the franchise. The studios became franchised in 1950; currently there are no corporate owned studios. Each franchise is individually owned &amp; operated. Currently there are 140 Fred Astaire studios in the United States alone. As of December 2010, Fred Astaire Dance Studios will now be franchising around the world and has studios opened in countries like Lebanon and South Africa.

'''Free festivals''' are a combination of music, arts and cultural activities, for which often no admission is charged, but involvement is preferred. They are identifiable by being multi-day events connected by a camping community without centralised control. The pioneering '''free festival movement''' started in the [[UK]] in the 1970s.

==History==
{{more citations needed|date=October 2010}}
The first intentionally free festival was the 1972 to 1974 [[Windsor Free Festival]], held in [[Windsor Great Park]], England. The 'organisation' was mostly [[Ubi Dwyer]] distributing thousands of leaflets and asking people and bands to bring their own equipment and create their own environment – "bring what you expect to find."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, M. (1982). The Politics of Pop Festivals. London: Junction Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Free festivals are practical demonstrations of what society could be like all the time: miniature utopias of joy and communal awareness rising for a few days from a grey morass of mundane, inhibited, paranoid and repressive everyday existence…The most lively [young people] escape geographically and physically to the ‘Never Never Land’ of a free festival where they become citizens, indeed rulers, in a new reality." Un-authored leaflet from 1980, quoted in George McKay's Senseless Acts of Beauty: Cultures of Resistance Since the Sixties (p.&amp;nbsp;15).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_x25qcM223AC&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=Free%20festivals%20are%20practical%20demonstrations%20of%20what%20society%20could%20be%20like%20all%20the%20time%3A%20miniature%20utopias%20of%20joy%20and%20communal%20awareness%20rising%20for%20a%20few%20days%20from%20a%20grey%20morass%20of%20mundane%2C%20inhibited%2C%20paranoid%20and%20repressive%20everyday%20existence&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false McKay, G. (1996). Senseless Acts of Beauty: Cultures of Resistance Since the Sixties. London: Verso Books.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[teknival]]s are a type of free festival, as are many [[technoparade]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''The Globe''' was a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] theatre built in 1868 and demolished in 1902. It was the third of five [[London]] theatres to bear the name. It was also known at various times as the Royal Globe Theatre or Globe Theatre Royal. Its repertoire consisted mainly of comedies and [[musical theatre|musical shows]].&lt;ref name=City&gt;&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/lma_learning/theatrelands/text.asp?ID=335  Illegitimate Drama and Rickety Twins: The Theatres of the Strand] accessed 23 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre's most famous production was ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' by [[Brandon Thomas]], which enjoyed a record-setting run at the theatre, having transferred to it from the [[Royalty Theatre]].

Earlier theatres with the name "Globe Theatre" included [[Shakespeare]]’s [[Globe Theatre|Bankside]] house, which closed in 1642, and the former Rotunda Theatre in [[Blackfriars Road]], which opened in 1833 for a few years and was renamed The Globe.&lt;ref name="Mander"&gt;Mander&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and history of the building==
The new Globe was built to the commission of its proprietor, [[Sefton Henry Parry|Sefton Parry]], and stood on the corner of [[Wych Street]] and Newcastle Streets,&lt;ref&gt;London Encyclopaedia, page 319&lt;/ref&gt; on the site of Lyon's Inn, lately demolished, an old [[Inn of Chancery]], belonging in former days to the [[Inner Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;'This Inn, never of much importance, had fallen utterly into disrepute before the beginning of [the 19th] century, and become the resort of gamblers and swindlers... [and] was sold about the year 1863’: Thornbury&lt;/ref&gt; The Globe backed on to another theatre owned by Parry, the even more jerry-built [[Opera Comique]], which opened two years before the Globe. The two theatres were known as 'the rickety twins': both were of such flimsy construction that performers could hear each other through the common wall.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Parry built the theatre cheaply, hoping ‘to make handsome profits in compensation when the area was demolished, which was even then in contemplation’.&lt;ref&gt;London Encyclopaedia, p.319.  See also [http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/lma_learning/theatrelands/text.asp?ID=335 this information about theatres of The Strand]&lt;/ref&gt; It remained in contemplation for more than thirty years.

The Globe was taken over and partially rebuilt only two years after its opening.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;  The architect was [[Walter Emden]],&lt;ref name=City/&gt; whose surviving London theatres are [[Duke of York's Theatre|The Duke of York’s]], and (in collaboration) The [[Garrick Theatre]] and [[Royal Court Theatre]]. ''Old and New London'' described the theatre thus:
[[File:LONDON ILLUSTRATED p1.080 ADS. - GLOBE THEATRE.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1872 announcement]]
:The auditorium is effectively decorated in relief, and has a domed ceiling, with a sunlight in the centre. The site having been excavated very considerably for the proposed hotel [an abandoned project], the floor of the pit has been made many feet below the line of the street, and is approached by a steep flight of steps from Wych Street. In Wych Street also are the entrances to the gallery stairs, and that to the "royal box." The ordinary boxes are entered from Newcastle Street, and are on a level with the street, so that stairs are avoided. Here, too, enter the occupants of the stalls. The seats are all fairly commodious, and conveniently placed, so that all that is passing on the stage can be distinctly seen and heard from any part of the house.&lt;ref name="Thornbury"&gt;Thornbury&lt;/ref&gt;

The ‘sunlight’ referred to above was a glass roof giving the auditorium natural light, day and night, and allowing ventilation at all times: in an age of gas lighting, the latter would have been a marked advantage.&lt;ref name="Goodman, p. 36"&gt;Goodman, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, at the adjoining Opera Comique audiences ‘perspired and gasped.’&lt;ref&gt;[[Jessie Bond]], quoted in Baily, p, 156&lt;/ref&gt;  In a print of the 1890s, ‘A visit to the opera’, showing the royal coach on its way to [[Covent Garden]], the dome of the Globe can be seen in the background with its name picked out in electric lights: not a grand enough venue to be favoured with a royal visit, but still an established landmark.&lt;ref name=City/&gt;

Authorities differ on the size of the house.  According to ''[[The London Encyclopaedia]]'' the capacity was 1,800; ''Old and New London'' (1897) puts it at 1,500. In either case it was one of London’s larger theatres.  Acknowledging the history of the title ‘Globe Theatre’, the new house featured an act-drop representing a view of [[Stratford-Upon-Avon]]. That act-drop was destroyed in a fire, and replaced by another with a view of [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]]'s cottage.&lt;ref name="Mander"/&gt;  The last managers of the theatre were [[Fred Terry]] and [[Julia Neilson]].

The theatre closed in 1902 and was then demolished as part of the Strand Improvement Scheme, and construction of [[Aldwych]]. [[Bush House]] now stands on the site.

==Productions at the theatre==
[[File:Vicarbray1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Rutland Barrington]] and Mary Duggan in ''[[The Vicar of Bray (opera)|The Vicar of Bray]]'']]
The Globe opened with [[Henry J. Byron]]'s comedy ''Cyril's Success'', which ''Old and New London'' described as a great success.&lt;ref name="Thornbury"/&gt;  Later presentations included:
*''Committed for Trial'', a farce by [[W. S. Gilbert]] (1874)&lt;ref name="Goodman, p. 36"/&gt; (translated from ''Le Reveillon'' by [[Henri Meilhac]] and [[Ludovic Halévy]]).
*''[[The Vicar of Bray (opera)|The Vicar of Bray]]'', a [[comic opera]] by [[Sydney Grundy]] and  [[Edward Solomon]] (1882).&lt;ref&gt;Rollins &amp; Witts, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Private Secretary]]'', a farce by and starring [[Sir Charles Hawtrey]] (transferred from [[Scala Theatre|The Prince of Wales's Theatre]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Victorian Web&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Francis Robert Benson|Sir Frank Benson’s]] production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1890).&lt;ref&gt;Emory&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Gay Lord Quex''  by [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] (1899), then the most daring play of its time, with [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]], Gilbert Howe and [[Irene Vanbrugh]] in the cast. In this production, which ran for 300 performances, ladies first smoked cigarettes on stage.&lt;ref&gt;London Encyclopedia, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' by [[Brandon Thomas]] (transferred from [[Royalty Theatre|The Royalty]] in 1893), which ran for 1,466 performances in London, the longest run of any theatre piece in the world at that time.&lt;ref&gt;London Encyclopedia, p. 319. Its record run was not surpassed by another (non-musical) play in London for another fifty years, when [[Noël Coward]]’s ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'' overtook it: see [http://www.world-theatres.com/longruns.html#longruns.london.html this description of longest London theatre runs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402061014/http://world-theatres.com/longruns.html |date=2 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also had a record-breaking four-year run on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and in Paris and toured extensively.

==History==
Grey Fox Bluegrass Festival began in 1984 as the Winterhawk Bluegrass Festival on the Rothvoss Farm in Ancramdale, Columbia County, New York on the site of the 1976 Berkshire Mountain Bluegrass Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/20/arts/music/20fox.html|title=At the Corner of Dawg &amp; Monroe, a New York D.I.Y. Bluegrass Festival|date=20 July 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer Mary Tyler Doub asked Ron Thamason and his band the Dry Branch Fire Squad to host the festival's main stage show.&lt;ref name=bu&gt;[http://bluegrassmusic.com/content/2011/feature/ron-thomason-told-you-that-to-tell-you-this/ "Ron Thomason – Told You That To Tell You This"] ''Bluegrass Unlimited'', August 1st, 2011 By Chris Stuart&lt;/ref&gt;

Doub moved the event to the Walsh Farm in [[Oak Hill, New York]] on the banks of Catskill Creek in 2008.&lt;ref name="dailygazette.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailygazette.com/news/2008/jul/17/0717_greyfox/?print|title=Printable Article: Tim O’Brien to wear multiple musical hats at Grey Fox festival - dailygazette.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Grey Fox was named Bluegrass Event of the Year by the [[International Bluegrass Music Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ibma.org/awards/recipient-history#eventyear|title=Recipient History|work=International Bluegrass Music Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 86-minute documentary, ''Bluegrass Journey'' (2003), was filmed in part at Grey Fox,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/307953/Bluegrass-Journey/overview "Bluegrass Journey"]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, Grey Fox Bluegrass Festival was one of ten musical events around the world featured in BBC World’s television series, ''Destination Music''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluegrasstoday.com/destination-music-follow-up/|title=Destination Music – follow up|work=Bluegrass Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program==
Each year the festival program includes about than 40 acts on five stages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00EFD61031F932A25754C0A9669D8B63|title=THE WEEK AHEAD  -  JULY 11--JULY 17 - NYTimes.com|date=11 July 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Notable artists have included [[Sam Bush]], [[Tony Rice]], [[Nickel Creek]] and [[Béla Fleck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/20/arts/music/20fox.html|title=At the Corner of Dawg &amp; Monroe, a New York D.I.Y.

The '''''Gukurahundi''''' was a series of massacres of [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] civilians carried out by the [[Zimbabwe National Army]] from early 1983 to late 1987. It derives from a [[Shona language]] term which loosely translates to "the early rain which washes away the [[chaff]] before the spring rains".&lt;ref name="watch"&gt;Nyarota, Geoffrey. ''Against the Grain''. Page 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Rhodesian Bush War]] two rival nationalist parties, [[Robert Mugabe]]'s [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU) and [[Joshua Nkomo]]'s [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU), had emerged to challenge [[Rhodesia]]'s predominantly white government.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Harold|title=Zimbabwe: A Country Study|pages=243–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; ZANU initially defined ''Gukurahundi'' as an ideological strategy aimed at carrying the war into major settlements and individual homesteads.&lt;ref name="Bob"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mugabe|first=Robert|title=1979, the year of the people's storm: Gore re Gukarahundi|asin=B0007C68IO|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Mugabe's ascension to power, his government remained threatened by "dissidents" – disgruntled former guerrillas and supporters of ZAPU.&lt;ref name="CCJP"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/BreakingTheSilenceBuildingTruePeace|title=Breaking the Silence, Building True Peace: Report on the 1980s Disturbances in Matabeleland and the Midlands|last=|first=|publisher=Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe and the Legal Resources Foundation (Zimbabwe)|year=1997|isbn=|editor=Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe|location=Harare, Zimbabwe|pages=|oclc=40480429|access-date=20 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101153012/https://archive.org/details/BreakingTheSilenceBuildingTruePeace|archive-date=1 November 2013|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZANU recruited mainly from the majority [[Shona people]], whereas the ZAPU had its greatest support among the minority Ndebele. In early 1983, the North Korean-trained [[Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade|Fifth Brigade]] began a crackdown on dissidents in [[Matabeleland North]], one of the homelands of the Ndebele. Over the following two years, thousands of Ndebele were detained by government forces and either marched to re-education camps or summarily executed. Although there are different estimates, the consensus of the [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]] is that more than 20,000 people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/mugabe-zimbabwe-gukurahundi-massacre-matabeleland|title=Zimbabwe: new documents claim to prove Mugabe ordered Gukurahundi killings|first=Stuart|last=Doran|date=19 May 2015|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Before the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], the main black nationalist organisation in [[Southern Rhodesia]], the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU), split into two groups in 1963, the split-away group being the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU).&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761587432/zimbabwe_african_national_union.html] "Zimbabwe African National Union," Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2008, accessed 30 June 2008.

There is a much earlier source for Shona hostility to the Ndebele, going back to the arrival in 1837 of Mzilikazi and his Matabele followers. Mzilikazi carved out a territory for himself by fighting and dispossessing the local Shona, and this humiliation has not been forgotten by the Shona.&lt;ref&gt;Tribes &amp; Kingdoms, JS Bergh &amp; AP Bergh, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

The armies of these two groups, ZAPU's [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA), and ZANU's [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA), developed rivalries for the support of the people and would fight each other. When Rhodesia became Zimbabwe in 1980, following the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], the two armies so distrusted each other that it was difficult to integrate them both into the National Army.&lt;ref name="Report"/&gt; These problems were only in [[Matabeleland]]. For example: former ZIPRA elements attacked civilian areas in Zvishavane, Kadoma and Bulawayo. It seemed ZIPRA had a hidden arms cache. There were major outbreaks of violence carried out by ZIPRA against the civilian population . The first of these was in November 1980, followed by a more serious incident in early 1981. This led to the defection of many ZIPRA members. ZAPU was supporting a new dissident war to improve its position in Zimbabwe. In the elections held in April 1980, ZANU received 57 out of 100 seats and Robert Mugabe became prime minister.&lt;ref name ="CCJP"/&gt;

A historian Dr Stuart Doran of events in Zimbabwe, using historical documents, has written a short article 'New documents claim to prove Mugabe ordered Gukurahundi killings' way back in 1983. Quoted in part: The documents point to internal killings neither provoked nor sustained by outsiders, suggesting that the atrocities were driven from the top by Zanu-PF in pursuit of specific political objectives. Viewed across a period of several years, the documents appear to provide evidence that the massacres were but one component of a sustained and strategic effort to remove all political opposition within five years of independence. Zanu-PF leaders were determined to secure a "victory" against a non-existent opposition in elections scheduled for 1985, after which there would be a "mandate" from the people to impose a one-party state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/mugabe-zimbabwe-gukurahundi-massacre-matabeleland|title=New documents claim to prove Mugabe ordered Gukurahundi killings|first=Stuart|last=Doran|date=19 May 2015|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entumbane uprisings==
{{Main|1980 Entumbane clashes|1981 Entumbane Uprising}}

In November 1980 [[Enos Nkala]] made remarks at a rally in [[Bulawayo]], in which he warned ZAPU that ZANU would deliver a few blows against them. This preceded the [[1980 Entumbane clashes|first outbreak of fighting]] in Entumbane, during which ZIPRA and the [[Zimbabwe National Army]] fought a pitched battle for two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thezimbabwetimes.com/?page_id=20|title=Zim News .NET Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe News - Zim Latest News - Zimbabwe News Today - News Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe Latest News Today- Zim News Latest Updates Now - Grace Robert Mugabe Latest News|website=Zim News .NET Zimbabwe- Zimbabwe News - Zim Latest News - Zimbabwe News Today Latest - Zim News Latest Updates|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1981 there was a [[1981 Entumbane Uprising|second uprising]], which spread to Glenville and also to Connemara in the Midlands. ZIPRA troops in other parts of [[Matabeleland]] headed for [[Bulawayo]] to join the battle, and the Zimbabwean National army units had to come in to stop the fighting.

The government asked Justice [[Enoch Dumbutshena]], the former Chief Justice of [[Zimbabwe]], to hold an inquiry into the uprising – ZIPRA was found to be preparing for war.

Many ZIPRA cadres defected after Entumbane, fearing retribution.

==1982==
This situation became worse after the finding of arms caches in February 1982. ZANU now openly accused ZAPU of plotting another war and ZAPU leaders were arrested or removed from cabinet. However, the treason trial in 1982 involving [[Dumiso Dabengwa]], [[Lookout Masuku]] and four others failed to prove a case against them. All were released although Dabengwa and Masuku were re-detained without trial for four years. As a result, ex-ZIPRA cadres deserted the army after this. They did this out of necessity to stay alive. With their leaders all locked up or in exile, they felt there was nobody to protect them within the army. "We were threatened, that was why I decided to desert," said one dissident.&lt;ref name="Report"/&gt;

The army integration scheme saw former Zipra recruits being harassed and accused of sympathising with their deserted colleagues. They were no longer trusted and were being constantly harassed. However, Joshua Nkomo publicly disowned the deserted soldiers and thus discouraged any others from leaving the army.

Meanwhile, South Africa's policy of destabilising Zimbabwe by military means, while blaming ZAPU for the actions of South African agents, continued and  escalate the breakdown between ZAPU and ZANU.&lt;ref name ="CCJP"/&gt;

==Fifth Brigade==
{{main|Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade}}
[[Robert Mugabe]], then Prime Minister, had signed an agreement with [[Eternal President of the Republic|North Korean President]] [[Kim Il Sung]] in October 1980 to have the North Korean military train a brigade for the Zimbabwean army. This was soon after Mugabe had announced the need for a militia to "combat malcontents."
Mugabe replied by saying dissidents should "watch out," announcing the brigade would be called "Gukurahundi."&lt;ref name="watch"/&gt; This brigade was named the Fifth Brigade. The members of the Fifth Brigade were drawn from 3500 ex-ZANLA troops at Tongogara Assembly Point, named after [[Josiah Tongogara]], the ZANLA general. There were a few ZIPRA (ZAPU) troops in the unit for a start, but they were withdrawn before the end of the training. The training of 5 Brigade lasted until September 1982, when Minister Sekeramayi announced training was complete.

The first Commander of the Fifth Brigade was Colonel [[Perence Shiri]]. The Fifth Brigade was different from all other Zimbabwean army units in that it was directly subordinated to the Prime Minister office, and not integrated to the normal army command structures. Their codes, uniforms, radios and equipment were not compatible with other army units. Their most distinguishing feature in the field was their red berets.&lt;ref name="Report"/&gt;

==Conflict and killings==
In January 1983, a crackdown by the elite Fifth Brigade in [[Matabeleland North]] was initiated to purge the dissidents, and its participation lasted until late 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.codesria.org/IMG/pdf/4-Mashingaidze.pdf|title=The 1987 Zimbabwe National Unity Accord and its Aftermath|last=Mashingaidze|first=Terence|date=31 October 2005|website=Codesria|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade's directives apparently specified a search for local ZAPU officials and veterans of ZAPU's armed wing, the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA).&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitutions and Conflict Management in Africa Preventing Civil War Through Institutional Design|last=Reynolds|first=Andrew|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8122-4658-2|editor-last=Kuperman|editor-first=Alan|location=Philadelphia|pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seizure or detention by the Fifth Brigade was arbitrary. In [[Bulawayo]], for instance, Ndebele men of fighting age were considered potential dissidents and therefore, guilty of subversive activities.&lt;ref name="Werbner"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tears of the Dead: The Social Biography of an African Family|last=Werbner|first=Richard|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1991|isbn=978-1560981503|location=Edinburgh|pages=160–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most detained were summarily executed or marched to re-education camps.&lt;ref name="Cry" /&gt; Most of the dead were shot in public executions, often after being forced to dig their own graves in front of family and fellow villagers. On occasion the Fifth Brigade also massacred large groups of Ndebele, seemingly at random&amp;mdash;the largest such incident occurred in March 1983, when 62 young men and women were shot on the banks of the Cewale River, [[Lupane District|Lupane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africafiles.org/article.asp?ID=3843|title=AfricaFiles - The Matabeleland Report: A lot to hide|website=www.africafiles.org|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven survived with gunshot wounds, the other 55 died. Another way 5 Brigade used to kill large groups of people was to burn them alive in huts. They did this in [[Tsholotsho]] and also in Lupane. They would routinely round up dozens, or even hundreds, of civilians and march them at gun point to a central place, like a school or bore-hole. There they would be forced to sing Shona songs praising ZANU, at the same time being beaten with sticks. These gatherings usually ended with public executions. Those killed could be ex-ZIPRAs, ZAPU officials, or anybody chosen at random. The Zimbabwe government repudiated these allegations and accused the hostile foreign press of fabricating stories. Zimbabwean Minister for National Security [[Sydney Sekeramayi]] countered that allegations of atrocities were part of a ZAPU disinformation programme to discredit the army.&lt;ref name="Cry" /&gt; The government characterised such allegations as irresponsible, contrived propaganda because it failed to give proper weight to the violence by dissidents,&lt;ref&gt;Collier's Yearbook, 1982, 1983, New York: MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt; who targeted ZANU officials. It is estimated that 700–800 people were murdered by dissident gangs in rural regions.&lt;ref name="CCJP" /&gt; In August 1985, dissidents massacred 22 Shona civilians in Mwenezi. On a mission farm in Matobo, dissidents massacred 16 people.&lt;ref&gt;E.P Makambe, Marginalising the Human Rights Campaign: The Dissident Factor and the Politics of Violence in Zimbabwe, 1980–1987, Institute of Southern African Studies, National University of Lesotho&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death estimates ===
The [[Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe]] documented at least 2,000 deaths, and speculated that the actual number could be 8,000 or higher.&lt;ref name="CCJP" /&gt; Local Ndebele put the figure between 20,000&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/mugabe-zimbabwe-gukurahundi-massacre-matabeleland|title=New documents claim to prove Mugabe ordered Gukurahundi killings|last1=Doran|first1=Stuart|website=https://www.theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 30,000.&lt;ref name="hill77"&gt;{{cite book

=== Reactions ===
In 1992 serving Defence Minister [[Moven Mahachi]] became the first ZANU official who publicly apologised for the execution and torture of civilians by the Fifth Brigade. Five years later, [[Enos Nkala]], former Defence Minister, described his involvement with ''Gukurahundi'' as "eternal hell" and blamed President Mugabe for having orchestrated it.&lt;ref name="Nkala"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thezimbabwedaily.com/zimbabwe/11798-mugabe-meets-enos-nkala.html|title=Mugabe meets Enos Nkala|last=Staff|first=Reporter|date=18 May 2012|work=The Zimbabwe Daily|accessdate=14 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314074841/http://www.thezimbabwedaily.com/zimbabwe/11798-mugabe-meets-enos-nkala.html|archivedate=14 March 2016|deadurl=yes|location=Harare, Zimbabwe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at Joshua Nkomo's memorial service on 2 July 2000, Mugabe admitted that "thousands" had been killed during the campaign, calling it a "moment of madness".&lt;ref name="Cry" /&gt;

==Unity Accord of 1987==
[[Robert Mugabe]] and ZAPU leader [[Joshua Nkomo]] signed the Unity Accord on 22 December 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/landmarks-in-robert-mugabes-life-853020.html "Landmarks in Robert Mugabe's life"] ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively dissolved ZAPU and ZANU into the [[Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front]] (ZANU-PF). On 18 April 1988, Mugabe announced an amnesty for all dissidents, and Nkomo called on them to lay down their arms. A general ordinance was issued saying all those who surrendered before 31 May would get a full pardon. This was extended not just to dissidents but to criminals of various types serving jail terms. Over the next few weeks, 122 dissidents surrendered.

In June the amnesty was extended to include all members of the security forces who had committed human rights violations.

In the 1990s the disturbances were finally at an end. This brought relief nationwide, but in parts of the country it has left behind many problems that remain unsolved to this day. These include poor health, poverty, practical and legal problems and a deep-rooted suspicion of Government officials.

The event was first started in 2014, when 60 women [[Brewery|brewmasters]] around the world simultaneously brewed the same recipe of craft beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/restaurants/las-female-brewers-to-celebrate-international-womens-collaboration-brew-day-4495475|title=L.A.'s Female Brewers to Celebrate International Women's Collaboration Brew Day|last=Bennett|first=Sarah|date=7 March 2014|work=LA Weekly|access-date=19 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event helps to raise awareness of women working in the [[Beer|brewing industry]], especially as brewmasters.

[[File:IWCBD-001.jpg|thumb|The first of the iconic IWCBD logo's designed by Monarose Ryan]]The idea for the IWCBD came from Project Venus member, Sophie de Ronde, who reached out to the [[Pink Boots Society]] in 2013 to start a "unified brew day."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brewbound.com/news/second-annual-international-womens-collaboration-brew-day-attracts-global-participation|title=Second Annual International Women’s Collaboration Brew Day Attracts Global Participation|last=|first=|date=24 February 2015|work=Brewbound|access-date=19 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Ronde wanted the day "to encourage women to brew together."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/brew-riverhead-brewery-tap-celebrate-10876368|title=Brew with Riverhead Brewery Tap to celebrate International Women's Day 2016|last=Gildea|first=Samantha|date=19 February 2016|work=The Huddersfield Daily Examiner|access-date=19 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day was meant to coincide with [[International Women's Day]] and would "raise awareness of women in the brewing industry and raise money for local charities and Pink Boots Society."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Brewing beer has become a male-dominated industry and is "still struggling with [[sexism]] and gender bias."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://torontoist.com/2016/01/inherent-weisse-fighting-sexism-in-the-craft-beer-world/|title=Inherent Weisse: Fighting Sexism in the Craft Beer World|last=Leblanc|first=Robin|date=22 January 2016|work=Torontoist|access-date=19 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another participant said, "I'd like to normalize the idea that women can and do work in the brewhouse along with other departments in a brewery."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''James Patrick Hosty Jr.''' (August 28, 1924 – June 10, 2011) was an [[Americans|American]] [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special agent|agent]] assigned to investigate [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] upon Oswald's June 1962 return to the United States after his defection to the [[Soviet Union]]. After Hosty made contact with Marina Oswald (a Soviet citizen) in order to interview her about her recent entry into the United States, Oswald wrote him a letter to protest the "harassment" of his wife Marina, and had Hosty's name and phone number in his address book.&lt;ref&gt;
http://issuu.com/ajweberman/docs/1adressbookcolor/38?e=0/10629136 p. 38 of Oswald's Address Book.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy assassination]], Hosty did not disclose Oswald's letter about Marina to the [[Warren Commission]] and destroyed it on his superior's order. Because of this, Hosty attracted speculation as a possible conspirator in several [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref name=Goldman&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldman|first=Peter|title=Dallas: New Questions and Answers|url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/White%20Magazines%20And%20Articles/Newsweek%2004-28-75/Item%2001.pdf|accessdate=January 3, 2013|newspaper=Newsweek|date=April 28, 1975|page=37|author2=John J. Lindsay|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hosty was transferred to the FBI's Kansas City office until his mandatory retirement in 1979. Hosty later wrote a memoir about the Kennedy assassination, titled ''Assignment: Oswald''.

==Biography==
Hosty was born on August 28, 1924, in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Vitello"/&gt; He was one of seven children of Charlotte Irene and James Patrick Hosty Sr., an executive in a sugar company in Chicago.&lt;ref name="Vitello"/&gt;

He received an unsigned note from Lee Harvey Oswald about two weeks before the [[Kennedy assassination]]. The note asked Hosty to stop questioning Oswald's wife. Hosty filed it away. He first met Oswald on November 22, 1963. It was while he was interrogating Oswald on November 22 that he realized that the unsigned note he had received two weeks prior was from Oswald. He said that, on orders from his supervisor, he destroyed the note after Oswald was killed on November 24, 1963.&lt;ref name="Vitello"/&gt;

He retired from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="Vitello"/&gt;

He died of [[prostate cancer]] on June 10, 2011, in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="Vitello"&gt;{{cite news |last=Vitello |first=Paul |date=June 19, 2011 |title=James P.

== Portrayal in fiction ==
Hosty was portrayed in the 1991 [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' as having a central role in a government conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy and frame Oswald.&lt;ref name="Vitello"/&gt; In the 2011 [[Stephen King]] novel ''[[11/22/63]]'', Hosty questions the protagonist Jake Epping, a time traveler who has just narrowly prevented Oswald from killing the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Stephen |date=2011 |title=11/22/63 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MJNi0uU8kdoC |publisher= |page=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn= 9781451627305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hosty is suspicious of Epping because of what he knows about Oswald and his investigation by the FBI, but assists Epping in his efforts to quietly disappear, so that he may return to 2011. (The television adaptation has Epping returning to 2016.)

In 2013, actor [[Ron Livingston]] portrayed Hosty in writer/director [[Peter Landesman]]'s film ''[[Parkland (film)|Parkland]]'', a film which recounts the chaotic events that occurred at Dallas' Parkland Hospital on the day JFK was assassinated.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2345112/|title=Parkland |work=IMDB |date=October 4, 2013 |author=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2015}}

'''John Gerard''' (4 October 1564 &amp;ndash; 27 July 1637)&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lifefatherjohng00morrgoog#page/n26/mode/2up–1637) Morris, John. ''The Life of Father John Gerard'', London, Burns and Oates, 1881]&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[English people|English]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Catholic priest|priest]], operating covertly in England during the [[Elizabethan era]] in which the [[Catholic Church]] was subject to [[persecution]]. He was the second son of Sir Thomas Gerard of [[Bryn, Greater Manchester|Bryn]], in [[Ashton-in-Makerfield]], Lancashire. 

Gerard is noted not only for successfully hiding from the English authorities for eight years before his capture, but for enduring extensive torture, escaping from the [[Tower of London]] and, after recovering, continuing with his covert mission. After his escape to the continent, he was later instructed by his Jesuit superiors to write a book about his life (in [[Latin]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The autobiography of an Elizabethan'' John Gerard (ISBN B0000CI1BG)&lt;/ref&gt; An English translation, published in 1951, is a rare first-hand account of the dangerous world of a Catholic priest in Elizabethan England.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Caraman, transl. ''The autobiography of a hunted priest by John Gerard''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
John Gerard was born 4 October 1564, the second son of Sir Thomas Gerard of Bryn, and Elizabeth, daughter and co-heiress of Sir John Port of Derbyshire. In 1569, when John Gerard was five years old, his father was imprisoned for plotting the rescue of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], from [[Tutbury Castle]]. His release in 1571 may have been influenced by his cousin Sir [[Gilbert Gerard (judge)|Gilbert Gerard]] who was [[Attorney General]] at that time. During that time John and his brother were placed with Protestant relatives, but his father obtained for them a Catholic tutor.

In August 1577, at age 12, he was sent to the [[English College, Douai|English College at Douai]], which relocated the following March to Rheims. At the age of fifteen, he spent a year at [[Exeter College, Oxford]]. This was followed by about a year of home-study of Greek and Latin, under a tutor, Mr. Leutner. He then went to the Jesuit Clermont College in Paris. After some months there, followed by an illness and convalescence, in the latter part of 1581 he went to Rouen to see Jesuit Father [[Robert Persons]].&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt;

==First mission ==
{{Marshalsea}}
As Gerard had left for Clermont without the requisite travel permit, upon his return to England, he was arrested by customs officials upon landing at Dover. While his companions were sent to London, he was released in the custody of a Protestant in-law. But after three months, having still not attended Anglican services, he was remanded to the [[Marshalsea]] prison. He spent a little over a year there in company with [[William Hartley (martyr)|William Hartley]], [[Stephen Rowsham]], [[John Adams (Catholic martyr)|John Adams]], and [[William Bishop (bishop)|William Bishop]]. In the spring of 1585, [[Anthony Babington]], who was later to be executed for treason for being involved in a plot to free the Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], posted bond to secure Gerard's release.&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt;

== Second mission ==
Gerard then went to Rome and was given another mission on behalf of the Jesuits to England. In November 1588, three months after the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]], Gerard and [[Edward Oldcorne]] landed in [[Norfolk]] to begin their task of sustaining the English Catholics. Eventually, Gerard was taken to the leader of the English Jesuits, Father [[Henry Garnet]]. Gerard soon became a very popular figure in the Catholic underground. To stay above suspicion, Gerard cultivated a respectable public image.&lt;ref name=McNamara&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Catholic/View-Tower-Pat-McNamara-12-11-2012 McNamara, Pat. "A View from the Tower of London", ''Patheos'', December 10, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; By way of disguises, he appeared very secular, being versed in gambling and wearing fashionable clothes. Gerard wrote of many escapes from the law and of occasions when he hid in [[priest hole]]s.

== Capture and torture ==
Gerard was finally captured in London on 23 April 1594, together with [[Nicholas Owen (Jesuit)|Nicholas Owen]]. He was tried, found guilty and sent to the [[Poultry Compter|Compter in the Poultry]]. Later he was moved to [[the Clink]] prison where he was able to meet regularly with other persecuted English [[Catholics]]. Due to his continuation of this work, he was sent to the [[Salt Tower]] in the [[Tower of London]], where he was further questioned and tortured by being repeatedly suspended from chains on the dungeon wall.&lt;ref name=McNamara/&gt;  The main aim of Gerard's torturers was to identify the London lodgings of Fr. [[Henry Garnet]] that they might arrest him. He would not answer any questions that involved others, or name them. He insisted that he never broke, a fact borne out by the files of the Tower.

Henry Garnet wrote about Gerard:
::"Twice he has been hung up by the hands with great cruelty on the part of others and no less patience on his own. The examiners say he is exceedingly obstinate and a great friend either of God or of the devil, for they say they cannot extract a word from his lips, save that, amidst his torments, he speaks the word, 'Jesus'. Recently they took him to the rack, where the torturers and examiners stood ready for work. But when he entered the place, he at once threw himself on his knees and with a loud voice prayed to God that ... he would give him strength and courage to be rent to pieces before he might speak a word that would be injurious to any person or to the divine glory. And seeing him so resolved, they did not torture him."&lt;ref&gt;Garnet, Henry, letter to Aquaviva dated May 7, 1597, Stonyhurst, Anglia 2, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

== Escape from the Tower ==
A famous exploit of his is believed to have been masterminded by Nicholas Owen. With help from other members of the Catholic underground, Gerard, along with John Arden, escaped on a rope strung across the Tower moat during the night of 4 October 1597. Despite the fact that his hands were still mangled from the tortures he had undergone, he succeeded in climbing down. He even arranged for the escape of his gaoler (jailer), with whom he had become friendly, and who he knew would be held responsible for the jailbreak. Immediately following his escape, he joined [[Henry Garnet]] and [[Robert Catesby]] in Uxbridge. Later, Gerard moved to the house of Dowager [[Edward Vaux, 4th Baron Vaux of Harrowden|Elizabeth Vaux]]&lt;ref name=gun&gt;[http://www.gunpowder-plot.org/gerard.asp "John Gerard", at the Gunpowder Plot Society], accessed 30 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Great Harrowden|Harrowden]], near Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. From this base of operations, he continued his priestly ministry, and reconciled many to the Catholic Church, including Sir [[Everard Digby]] (one of the conspirators in the [[Gunpowder Plot]]).

==Later life==
For the next eight years he continued his ministry among the English people before he was recalled to the continent to train Jesuits for the English Mission.&lt;ref name=McNamara/&gt; He was implicated by [[Robert Catesby]]'s servant [[Thomas Bates (Gunpowder plot)|Thomas Bates]] in the Gunpowder Plot although he denied any involvement. He stayed at Harrowden again, hiding in a [[priest hole]]. During a nine-day search of the house he wrote an open letter protesting his innocence, and contrived to have copies scattered about the streets of London, refuting the charges allegedly made by Bates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunpowder-plot.org/gerard.asp|title=The Gunpowder Plot Society|first=David|last=Herber|website=www.gunpowder-plot.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually escaped from there to London. He left the country with financial aid from Elizabeth Vaux, slipping away disguised as a footman in the retinue of the Spanish Ambassador,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06466c.htm |last=Pollen |first=John Hungerford |title=John Gerard |work=The Catholic Encyclopedia |volume=6 |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |year=1909 |accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the very day of [[Henry Garnet]]'s execution. Gerard went on to continue the work of the Jesuits in Europe, where he wrote his autobiography on the orders of his superiors. He died in 1637, aged 73, at the [[English College, Rome|English College seminary, Rome]].

The '''Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival''' (LTSF) brings the bard to life on the shores of [[Lake Tahoe]].

Performing a series of Shakespeare classics and introducing more contemporary works, audience members take their seats on the beach overlooking the lake to enjoy a picnic dinner before the start of the show.

== History ==
The Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival began in 1972 at Sugar Pine Point State Park on the west shore of Lake Tahoe.  The New Shakespeare Company presented eight performances during its inaugural season.  The Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival continued there for four years, until it ran into scheduling conflicts over the use of Sugar Pine Point's Ehrman Mansion.

In 1976, the company and Nevada State Parks agreed to hold the performances at Sand Harbor - even though it was considered to be a less accessible location. A bare-bones stage was hastily built for just over $1,000 in materials and labor. In 1976, the first year at Sand Harbor State Park, it is estimated over 500 people attended each of twelve performances.

At first, the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival was managed by the staff of Lake Tahoe Nevada State Park. In 1982, the North Tahoe Fine Arts Council (NTFAC) began "Tunes in the Dunes" and took over the management of the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival. The Festival prospered under the direction of NTFAC and became a cultural tradition at the park. Each year, more and more people made the trip to enjoy a picnic and a play under the stars at Sand Harbor. But in 1992, the North Tahoe Fine Arts Council folded and a new manager for the Festival was needed.

The Incline Village Crystal Bay Visitors and Convention Bureau was selected to manage the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival. In 1995, a long-term contract was signed with the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival, a non-profit group dedicated to managing and improving the performances at Sand Harbor. As part of the agreement, the LTSF, completely through private funding, constructed a state of the art stage facility. The Warren Edward Trepp Stage, built at a cost of nearly two million dollars, was dedicated at the start of the 2000 season. 

In May 1999, the [[Parasol Foundation]], a non-profit community foundation, was awarded a grant from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation through the Community Services Center Program. The Community Services Program is designed to help privately supported, non-profit organizations with 501 C (3) status, join together to house their operations in a shared facility. 

In 2010 the Festival hired artistic director [[Charles Fee]] to improve flagging attendance and sponsorship shortfalls due to "economic woes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tahoebonanza.com/article/20100627/NEWS/100629934 ''2010 Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival gets $75K boost, event begins in two weeks''  Lake Tahoe Bonanza, 27 June 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716191339/http://www.tahoebonanza.com/article/20100627/NEWS/100629934 |date=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fee is now the producing artistic director for three Shakespeare festivals concurrently, including [[Great Lakes Theater Festival]] in Cleveland, Ohio and [[Idaho Shakespeare Festival]] in Boise, ID.

== Educational outreach program ==
===The D.G. Menchetti Young Shakespeare Program===
The Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival offers twelve free matinee performances throughout the Reno-Tahoe-Truckee region during the summer, specifically written and directed for a younger audience. The abbreviated performances offer an introduction to theatre for children. 

===InterACT workshops===
Offered to schools and community groups in Nevada and California from February to September, these workshops are highly interactive and feature activities to help students understand the themes of Shakespeare's works, as well as to learn acting and performance skills.

== More than Shakespeare? ==
For the last few years the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival has been bringing more than Shakespeare performances to the Sand Harbor Amphitheatre to entertain residents and visitors to the Reno&amp;ndash;Lake Tahoe region, including performances by the [[Reno Philharmonic Orchestra]], Chautauqua, Reno Jazz Orchestra, [[Pacific Mambo Orchestra]] and the Sierra Nevada Ballet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7849">A '''latch-up''' is a type of [[short circuit]] which can occur in an [[integrated circuit]] (IC). More specifically it is the inadvertent creation of a low-[[Electrical impedance|impedance]] path between the power supply rails of a [[MOSFET]] circuit, triggering a [[parasitic structure]] which disrupts proper functioning of the part, possibly even leading to its destruction due to overcurrent. A [[Power cycling|power cycle]] is required to correct this situation.

A '''single event latch-up''' is a latch-up caused by a [[single event upset]], typically heavy ions or protons from cosmic rays or solar flares.&lt;ref&gt;

[http://www.techbriefs.com/component/content/article/1836 "Single-event latch-up protection of integrated circuits"].

&lt;/ref&gt;

The parasitic structure is usually equivalent to a [[thyristor]] (or [[Silicon-controlled rectifier|SCR]]), a [[P-n junction|PNPN]] structure which acts as a PNP and an NPN [[Bipolar junction transistor|transistor]] stacked next to each other. During a latch-up when one of the transistors is conducting, the other one begins conducting too. They both keep each other in saturation for as long as the structure is forward-biased and some current flows through it - which usually means until a power-down. The SCR parasitic structure is formed as a part of the totem-pole [[MOSFET|PMOS and NMOS transistor]] pair on the output drivers of the gates.

The latch-up does not have to happen between the power rails - it can happen at any place where the required parasitic structure exists. A common cause of latch-up is a positive or negative voltage spike on an input or output pin of a digital chip that exceeds the rail voltage by more than a diode drop. Another cause is the supply voltage exceeding the absolute maximum rating, often from a [[Transient (oscillation)|transient]] [[voltage spike|spike]] in the power supply. It leads to a [[avalanche diode|breakdown]] of an internal [[P-n junction|junction]]. This frequently happens in circuits which use multiple supply voltages that do not come up in the required sequence on power-up, leading to voltages on data lines exceeding the input rating of parts that have not yet reached a nominal supply voltage. Latch-ups can also be caused by an [[electrostatic discharge]] event.

[[File:latchup.png|right|thumb|400px|Intrinsic bipolar junction transistors in the CMOS technology]]  

Another common cause of latch-ups is [[ionizing radiation]] which makes this a significant issue in electronic products designed for space (or very high-altitude) applications.

High-power microwave interference can also trigger latch ups.&lt;ref&gt;

Both CMOS integrated circuits and TTL integrated circuits are more susceptible to latch-up at higher temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==CMOS latch-up==

All CMOS ICs have latch-up paths, but there are several design techniques that reduce susceptibility to latch-up.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In CMOS technology, there are a number of intrinsic bipolar junction transistors. In CMOS processes, these transistors can create problems when the combination of n-well/p-well and substrate results in the formation of parasitic n-p-n-p structures. Triggering these thyristor-like devices leads to a shorting of the Vdd and GND lines, usually resulting in destruction of the chip, or a system failure that can only be resolved by power-down. &lt;ref&gt;'''Jan M. Rabaey''', University of California,Berkeley;'''Anantha Chandrakasan''', Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge;'''Borivoje Nikolic''', University of California, Berkeley; Digital Integrated Circuits (2nd Edition) {{ISBN|978-0-13-090996-1}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the n-well structure in the first figure. The n-p-n-p structure is formed by the source of the NMOS, the p-substrate, the n-well and the source of the PMOS. A circuit equivalent is also shown. When one of the two bipolar transistors gets forward biased (due to current flowing through the well, or substrate), it feeds the base of the other transistor. This positive feedback increases the current until the circuit fails or burns out.

The invention of the now industry-standard technique to prevent CMOS latch-up was made by Hughes Aircraft company in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.google.com/patents/US4173767 "Hughes Aircraft Patent US4173767"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preventing latch-up ==
It is possible to design chips to be resistant to latch-up by adding a layer of insulating oxide (called a ''trench'') that surrounds both the NMOS and the PMOS transistors. This breaks the parasitic SCR structure between these transistors. Such parts are important in the cases where the proper sequencing of power and signals cannot be guaranteed, such as [[hot swap]] devices. 

Devices fabricated in lightly doped epitaxial layers grown on heavily doped substrates are also less susceptible to latch-up. The heavily doped layer acts as a current sink where excess minority carriers can quickly recombine.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Campbell, The Science and Engineering of Microelectronic Fabrication, Oxford University Press (Indian Edition 2007) p.461 {{ISBN|978-0-19-568144-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[silicon on insulator|silicon-on-insulator]] devices are inherently latch-up-resistant. Latch-up is the low resistance connection between tub{{Clarify|date=November 2013}} and power supply rails.

Also to avoid the latch, a separate tap connection is put for each transistor. But this will increase the size of the device so fabs give a minimum space to put a tap, for example, 10&amp;nbsp;µm in 130&amp;nbsp;nm technology.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}

== Testing for latch-up ==

The '''Liberal Democrat Federal Conference''' (often referred to as the '''Liberal Democrat Conference''') is an internal body of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], as of September 2018 the third-largest UK-wide political party in terms of both votes cast and seats in the British Parliament. The Federal Conference is the highest representative body of the Liberal Democrats, which is one of the few British political parties to use its annual gathering for voting and policy resolution. The event also features speeches from prominent party members and guests and an exhibition. There are also several fringe events, run by internal political groups such as [[Liberal Reform]], [[Social Liberal Forum]] and [[Young Liberals (UK)|Young Liberals]], and a well-established late-evening entertainment revue known as the [[Glee Club (UK politics)|Glee Club]].
 
The Federal Conference takes place twice per year, first as the ''Spring Conference'', usually held in March and then the ''Autumn Conference'', usually in September.&lt;ref name=B1&gt;Roger Mortimore and Andrew Blick, ''Butler's British Political Facts'', Palgrave Macmillan 2018, p. 274 &amp; 275&lt;/ref&gt;  The first Federal Conference was held in [[Blackpool]], in North West England, from 25 to 29 September 1988,&lt;ref name=B1/&gt; with the most recent being the 62nd Conference, held in [[Brighton]], in Southern England, from 15 to 18 September 2018.&lt;ref name=LD&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.libdems.org.uk/autumn_conference_2018|title=Autumn Conference - Brighton: 15 - 18 September 2018|work=[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]|author=Jack Everitt|date=1 August 2018|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Conference is overseen by the ''Federal Conference Committee (FCC)'', which also selects motions and amendments for debates, runs Conference sessions and provides drafting advice and liaison. Its members are regularly elected and expected to be objective and fair in their selection of motions and amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.libdems.org.uk/federal_conference_committee|title=Federal Conference Committee|work=[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Conference does not choose the [[Leader of the Liberal Democrats]], who is instead elected by a party-wide ballot of all members, in a [[one member, one vote|one-member, one-vote]] contest. The system has been in use since the party's inception in 1988, predating changes to internal party voting rules by both the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] parties. Neither Liberal Democrat MPs, nor any other internal party groups, have special voting rights over either party policy or in the election of the party Leader.

|25—29 September 1988||[[Blackpool]]||[[Ian Wrigglesworth]]||Following a vote at the [[Liberal Assembly]] on 17 September 1987, and a Liberal Party Special Conference on 23 January 1988, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] agreed to seek merger with the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party (SDP)]]. A ballot of both parties members was counted on 2 March 1988, with 65,098 voting in favour and 16,294 against. Following the merger, the newly-created ''Social and Liberal Democrats'' holds its first Conference, known as the SLD Conference, under its new leader, [[Paddy Ashdown]], with its members referring to their party as "the Democrats".&lt;ref name=B2&gt;Roger Mortimore and Andrew Blick, ''Butler's British Political Facts'', Palgrave Macmillan 2018, p. 273 &amp; 274&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ashdown's first speech as leader, entitled ''The Path Ahead'', he says that he sees a "very exciting journey" ahead, and that the Labour Party, which has faced three consecutive general election defeats, could be replaced by the SLD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/its-hard-being-one-man-in-a-two-horse-race-1120541.html|title=It's hard being one man in a two-horse race|work=[[The Independent]]|author=O'Grady,Sean|date=19 September 1999|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And in our fight to control the abuse of power and modernise our political system, we carry the torch of liberals and democrats and radicals and reformers in every generation for four hundred years who have fought the vested interests of the day, to modernise our political system, and control the power of the State. In every generation, we have been opposed by the conservatives and the reactionaries. In every generation, we have succeeded through our tenacity, through the force of our ideas, and through the strength of our cause... We have won the power to make the difference. We have proved ourselves in local government. We have proved our ability to change the agenda. To put education at the forefront of national debate. To demand open, honest taxation. To set a new style of co-operation in politics, which puts country before party where it is right and where it can make a difference. Yes - we have earned the right and the power to make a difference. We have proved our ability to win".

Asdown continues: "I want every single one of you to look back on these next fifty days and be proud: proud to have been part of this great campaign. Proud that, like [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], you went to the country with a message you believed. Proud to have said what you think needs to be done for your country. Proud to have stood out against the fatalism of British politics. Proud to have said - it does not have to be like this. Yes, it can be done. Tell them how it is. Tell them what we will do. Tell them we will be their champions. Tell them their vote can make a difference".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=233|title=Speech Archive - Leader's speech to the Spring Party Conference, Cardiff 1997 - Paddy Ashdown (Liberal Democrat|work=British Poltical Speeches.com|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adapting a phrase from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Macbeth]], he quips: "Hubble, bubble, toil and trouble; the Tory party's reduced to rubble".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/the_daily_politics/6967366.stm|title=Your Favourite Conference Clips - Paddy Ashdown, 1997|work=BBC Daily Politics|date=3 October 2007|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outgoing leader, Paddy Ashdown,  tells the Conference that the party has been ahead of its time, and that it "rightly" talks about strategy, but that "no strategy will work, unless we have something fresh to say and offer something distinctive to vote for", and that if it fails to "think afresh", that it risks "falling into the easy trap of leftist, oppositional politics. And that," he says, "would mean making ourselves irrelevant again for a generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/453473.stm|title= UK Politics - Paddy Ashdown's speech|work=[[BBC News]]|date=21 September 1999|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new leader, Charles Kennedy, after thanking his predecessor, emphasises that in the forthcoming year, a number of elections are to be fought, and that it is important that politicians reconnect with voters, and that if they do, people will become "as enthusiastic about parties as they are about pressure groups". He says that if they don't, "derisory turnouts will be the norm". He says that party politics can make a difference beyond voting and by "engaging in the process", and that the party must inspire "a new generation of voters", and "connect [its] values and vision to everyday life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=57|title=Speech Archive - Leader's speech, Harrogate 1999b - Charles Kennedy (Liberal Democrat)|work=British Political Speeches.org|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''moveable feast''' or '''movable feast''' is an observance in a Christian [[liturgical calendar]] that occurs on a different date (relative to the dominant [[Civil calendar|civil]] or [[solar calendar]]) in different years.&lt;ref&gt;John Ayto ''Oxford Dictionary of English Idioms'' 2010  p123 019954378X "a movable feast an event which takes place at no regular time. In a religious context a movable feast is a feast day (especially Easter Day and the other Christian holy days whose dates are related to it) which does not occur on the same calendar date each year."&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most important set of moveable feasts are a fixed number of days before or after [[Easter Sunday]], which [[Computus|varies by over 40 days]] since it depends partly on the [[Lunisolar calendar|phase of the moon]] and must be [[Computus|computed each year]]. In [[Eastern Christianity]] (including the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Assyrian Church of the East, and the Eastern Catholic Churches), these moveable feasts form what is called the [[Paschal cycle]], which stands in contrast to the approach taken by [[Western Christianity|Catholic and Protestant Christianity]]. 

Most other [[feast day]]s, such as those of particular [[saint]]s, are ''fixed feasts'', held on the same date every year. However, some observances are always held on the same [[day of the week]], and thus occur on a range of days without depending on the date of Easter. For example, the start of [[Advent]] is the Sunday nearest November 30. In addition, the observance of some fixed feasts may move a few days in a particular year to not clash with that year's date for a more important moveable feast. There are rare examples of saints with genuinely moveable feast days, such as [[Saint Sarkis the Warrior]] in the calendar of the Armenian Church.

'''''Mythodea — Music for the NASA Mission: 2001 Mars Odyssey''''' is a 1993 [[choral symphony]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vangelismovements.com/mythodeabooklet.htm |title= 2001 concert program |accessdate= 2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Greek electronic composer and artist [[Vangelis]]. Originally premiered in concert in 1993,&lt;ref name="1993program"&gt;1993 concert program.&lt;/ref&gt; it was published in 2001 by Vangelis' new record label [[Sony Classical]], which also set up the [[NASA]] connection and promoted a new concert.&lt;ref name="klem"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elsew.com/data/klem107.htm |title= ''KLEMblad'' magazine, issue 107 |date= October 2001 |author= Vangelis |accessdate= 2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 version of ''Mythodea'' was recorded and played on-stage by: Vangelis on synthesizers and keyboards, the [[London Metropolitan Orchestra]] augmented by two [[harp]]ists, sopranos [[Kathleen Battle]] and [[Jessye Norman]], the chorus of the [[Greek National Opera]], and, for the concert only, the Seistron and Typana percussion ensembles. The concert was held in Athens, Greece on June 28, 2001, and the record was officially released on October 23, 2001, to coincide with the [[2001 Mars Odyssey]] spacecraft entering the orbit of planet [[Mars]]. A video of the concert was released in early 2002.&lt;ref name="elsewconcerts"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elsew.com/data/concerts.htm |title= "Elsewhere": Vangelis' Concerts |author= Lodewijks, Dennis |date=Jan 2005 |accessdate= 2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First concert: 1993 ==
The world premiere of ''Mythodia'' (first spelling) took place on July 13, 1993 as a public performance at the [[Odeon of Herodes Atticus|Herodes Atticus Theater]], in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], for charity purposes. On stage were: Vangelis, who provided the full musical score accompanied by two [[harp]]ists; [[mezzo-soprano]] Markella Hatziana, [[soprano]] Lucienne Deval, and the [[choir|chorus]] and [[percussion]] of the Greek National Lyric Stage, conducted by Yvan Cassar.&lt;ref name="1993program" /&gt;

''Mythodia'' was then a piece in seven movements.&lt;ref name="elsewconcerts" /&gt; Vangelis not only composed the music, he also wrote the lyrics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newbrain.gr/mythodea/text.htm |title= Lyrics of ''Mythodea'' in Greek |author= Vangelis |accessdate= 2006-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930104735/http://www.newbrain.gr/mythodea/text.htm |archivedate= September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ancient Greek]].&lt;ref name="movements"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vangelismovements.com/mythodea.htm |title= Album review |author=de Vries, Ivar |publisher= Movements |accessdate= 2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 interview with ''KLEMblad'' magazine, Vangelis stated,
: "This piece was composed in an hour. Yes, it took me an hour. […] I'm not using the technology in the conventional way. I'm not using computers."&lt;ref name="klem" /&gt;
For the [[Encore (concert)|encore]], Vangelis played a selection of his repertoire, including "La Petite Fille de la Mer" (from the album ''[[L'Apocalypse des animaux (album)|L'Apocalypse des Animaux]]''), "[[Chariots of Fire (album)|Chariots of Fire]]", "Pulstar" (from the album ''[[Albedo 0.39]]''), three tracks from the soundtrack of the film ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise (album)|Conquest of Paradise]]'' ("Hispañola", "City of Isabel" and "Conquest of Paradise"), and finished with a performance of the [[Hymn to Liberty|Greek national anthem]].&lt;ref name="elsewconcerts" /&gt;

== Second concert: 2001 ==
''Mythodea'' would remain unheard in public for the next eight years, but Vangelis kept a recording of the 1993 concert for himself.  Around the year 2000, [[Peter Gelb]] was the head of [[Sony Classical]] and was steering the record company in the direction of [[crossover (music)|crossover]] music rather than mainstream [[European classical music|classical repertoire]]. He had just signed with Vangelis and was in the process of selecting their first release together. Gelb was listening to some tapes that Vangelis had sent to him when he came upon ''Mythodea''. He described the event in an interview: "When I first heard ''Mythodea'' I was in ecstasy with its rhythm and power themes, and with no further hesitation I suggested it was recorded immediately."&lt;ref name="klem" /&gt;

With the approval of Vangelis to record ''Mythodea'' with a full orchestra as Gelb had suggested,&lt;ref name="klem" /&gt; Sony Classical developed a marketing plan of ''Mythodea'' that with the help of Vangelis' friend and colleague, Dr. Scott Bolton, grew to include a promotional tie-in with NASA, a dedicated website, an audio CD and a live concert that involved the Greek Government and was broadcast on TV and published on video. The deal with NASA made ''Mythodea'' the official music of the mission involving the spacecraft [[2001 Mars Odyssey]]. This mission took the spacecraft to the orbit of Mars on October 23, 2001, and the audio CD of ''Mythodea'' was scheduled to be officially released on the same day. Vangelis described the connection he felt between the music and the mission on the 2001 Mars Odyssey official website:

{{cquote| I made up the name ''Mythodea'' from the words myth and ode. And I felt in it a kind of shared or common path with NASA's current exploration of the planet [Mars]. Whatever we use as a key — music, mythology, science, mathematics, astronomy — we are all working to decode the mystery of creation, searching for our deepest roots.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/spotlight/vangelis01.html|publisher=NASA||title=Vangelis: Mythodea|accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The premiere of the new version of ''Mythodea'' was held on June 28, 2001.&lt;ref name="Billboard25"/&gt; By this date, the album had already been recorded and was finished. The concert was a live performance of the album, with everyone involved in the recording reprising their roles plus additional performers. The setting was the ancient (6th century BC) [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] in Athens, Greece, featured on the album and video covers. Vangelis commented on the selection of location in an interview: "The record company wanted to promote this work and asked me 'where [...]?' and I thought that [...] Greece was really appropriate.

The concert was filmed by a 20 members of camera crew, and taped for later broadcast on TV in November, and release on DVD.&lt;ref name="Billboard25"/&gt; The budget was set at US $7 million, split in half between the record company, Sony Classical, and the Greek government,&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/10/18/tlvang.xml|title=A symphony for alien ears|publisher=''Telegraph.co.uk''|date=2001-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; which considered the concert a good promotion for Greece abroad and included it as part of the Greek Cultural Olympiad leading to the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Garcia"&gt;{{cite book |title=Secrets of the Olympic Ceremonies |author=Myles Garcia |year=2014 |url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=g1g1wLMSZv8C |publisher=eBookIt |isbn=9781456608088}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were some objections raised, mainly by fellow musician [[Mikis Theodorakis]], over the use of both public money and an archaeological site.&lt;ref name="elsew"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elsew.com/data/concerts.htm#myth2001 |title= "Elsewhere": Vangelis' concerts/''Mythodea'' |author= Lodewijks, Dennis |date=Jan 2005 |accessdate= 2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vangelis himself, like in 1993, waived payment for his performance.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="status2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elsew.com/data/status.htm|author=Manolopoulou, Fouli (Vangelis production manager) |publisher= ''Status'' magazine |date= June 2002 |title= Vangelis Papathanasiou, the International Greek |accessdate= 2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spectacle involved 224 musicians on stage, the same involved in the recording: Vangelis, two harpists,s), the 75-person&lt;ref name="blake" /&gt; [[London Metropolitan Orchestra]], the 123-person chorus of the [[Greek National Opera]], plus 20 newcomers Greek [[percussion ensemble]]s Seistron and Typana, that provided 24 [[timpani]].&lt;ref name="Garcia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="houtert"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elsew.com/data/mthwitn2.htm|title="Elsewhere": Concert review |author=Van Houtert, John |accessdate= 2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performances also included Sony Classical soprano artists [[Kathleen Battle]] and [[Jessye Norman]].  In the back, a projection screen measuring {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|24|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height&lt;ref name="klem" /&gt; showed images of Mars supplied by NASA, combined with elements of ancient [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref name="elsew2" /&gt;

The number of attending spectators to the ticket-paid event was between 2,000,&lt;ref name="elsew" /&gt; 2,500,&lt;ref name="blake" /&gt; and 3,000&lt;ref name="Billboard25"/&gt; with another 30,000 people watching for free on a giant screen at the nearby [[Panathinaiko Stadium]].&lt;ref name="elsew" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Garcia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard25"/&gt; The concert lasted just over one hour, after which three encores were played: ''[[Chariots of Fire (album)|Chariots of Fire]]'', ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise (album)|Conquest of Paradise]]'', and a combination of Movements 9 and 10.&lt;ref name="elsewolder2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elsew.com/data/older2.htm|title="Elsewhere": News |author= Lodewijks, Dennis |date=June 2001 |accessdate= 2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mars itself made a special appearance at the concert as an announcer told the spectators to look for an orange spot shining in the clear sky above the orchestra.&lt;ref name="gomez"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elsew.com/data/mthwitn2.htm|title="Elsewhere": concert review |author=:Gomez, Samuel |accessdate= 2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concert was repeated the following day without an audience, to get extra camera angles. Despite not having been announced, around 50 people who showed up at the venue were admitted for free, authorized by Vangelis himself.&lt;ref name="houtert" /&gt; ''Mythodea'' was expected to be performed by other orchestras, without Vangelis' participation,&lt;ref name="blake" /&gt; but {{As of|2007|lc=on}} that had not happened.

The album was recorded at the [[Athens Concert Hall]] (Athens Μέγαρο Μουσικής - Megaro Moussikis), chosen for its excellent acoustics.&lt;ref name="tanea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsew.com/data/tanea.htm|title=Vangelis interview|publisher=Greek newspaper ''Ta Nea''|date=June 23, 2001|accessdate=2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the recording, Vangelis expanded the original composition of 1993 by adding two movements, extending two more and inserting some new cues throughout. The chorus parts were also touched upon, with lyrics and melodic changes.&lt;ref name="blake"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsew.com/data/bninterv.htm|date=2001-10-14|title=Blake Neely interview|author=Lodewijks, Dennis|accessdate=2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for Vangelis, none of the performers of the 1993 concert reprised their roles. Instead, Vangelis was accompanied by the [[London Metropolitan Orchestra]] augmented with two harpists, sopranos [[Kathleen Battle]] and [[Jessye Norman]] (both Sony Classical artists as well), and the [[Greek National Opera]] Choir and percussion ensemble. Vangelis asked musician Blake Neely to make the instrument transcriptions and conduct the orchestra as well.&lt;ref name="blake" /&gt;

Although the album was finished by the date of the concert in June 2001, its release was held back until October 23, 2001 to coincide with the entry of the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft in the orbit of Mars.&lt;ref name="Billboard25"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=_hMEAAAAMBAJ |title=Vangelis Prepares For Blastoff On Musical Mission To Mars |author=Maria Paravantes |date=August 25, 2001 |magazine=Billboard |volume=113 |issue=34 |page=50 |issn=0006-2510 |accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A promotional CD-audio was nevertheless given to the press at the date of the concert and a CD-audio in a blue velvet box was given to guests of a private dinner that took place after the concert.&lt;ref name="uncledon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vangeliscollector.com/vangelis_mythodea.htm|title=Vangelis Collector|author=Fennimore, Don|accessdate=2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, two of these boxes were auctioned off online for charity purposes, fetching a total of [[US dollar|US $]]2,435.&lt;ref name="elsew2" /&gt;

Vangelis noted that "it's really the music that manages to speak to all. In ''Mythodea'', everyone can find something to identify with, because it's in this shared language".&lt;ref name="Billboard25"/&gt;

=== Track listing ===
# "Introduction" – 2:43
# "Movement 1" – 5:41
# "Movement 2" – 5:39
# "Movement 3" – 5:51
# "Movement 4" – 13:42
# "Movement 5" – 6:35
# "Movement 6" – 6:27
# "Movement 7" – 4:58
# "Movement 8" – 3:07
# "Movement 9" – 5:00
# "Movement 10" – 3:03

Two CD-singles were also released, both featuring a track called "Mythodea Special Edit" (3:57) which combined parts of "Movement 9" and "Movement 1", plus either "Movement 1" or "Movement 7". They were not widely available, so their original purpose may have been purely promotional, as were specifically a number of other CD-single releases.&lt;ref name="elsew2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsew.com/data/albums.htm|title="Elsewhere": Vangelis' albums|author=Lodewijks, Dennis|accessdate=2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were variations on the track listing: some releases of the album carried alternative titles "Movement 1" through "Movement 11", and "Mythodea Special Edit" was sometimes included either as a bonus or as a hidden track.

The audio CD is CD-Text-enhanced, with the following header appearing on compatible players: ''Mythodea - Music for the NASA Mission: 2001 Mars Odyssey - Kathleen Battle, Jessye Norman, Vangelis''. Text for tracks appears like this one for track 4: ''Movement 3 / Vangelis - London Metropolitan Orchestra - Athens Opera Choir - K.Battle - J.Norman''.

=== Sales and awards ===
The album reached #1 in the sales charts of Greece, where it attained platinum certification&lt;ref name="status"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elsew.com/data/status.htm|publisher= ''Status'' magazine |date=June 2002 |title=Vangelis Papathanasiou, the International Greek |accessdate= 2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for the 2002 "Arion" Greek music awards, in the category "Best instrumental music". In Portugal, the album reached #2 in the charts and attained silver certification for over 10,000 sales.&lt;ref name="elsewolder3" /&gt; The album reached #39 in Italy, #46 in Germany and #75 in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://italiancharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Vangelis&amp;titel=Mythodea+-+Music+For+The+NASA+Mission%3A+2001+Mars+Odyssey&amp;cat=a |title=Vangelis - Mythodea charts |work=italiancharts.com |publisher=Hung Medien |accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' Classical Albums chart peaked at #12 position, charting 22 weeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/277731/vangelis/chart?f=900 |title=Vangelis Chart History - Classical Albums chart |publisher=Billboard |accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while #4 position on Top Classical Albums chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=MxIEAAAAMBAJ |title=Billboard Top Classical Albums |date=November 24, 2001 |publisher=Billboard |volume=113 |issue=47 |page=78 |accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/search/charts?f[0]=ts_chart_artistname%3AVangelis&amp;f[1]=ss_bb_type%3Achart_item&amp;type=2&amp;artist=Vangelis |title=Vangelis chart results |website=Billboard Biz |publisher=Billboard |access-date=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other appearances ===
A remixed version of "Movement 1" is included in the Vangelis compilation ''Odyssey: The Definitive Collection'' (2003). The opening march starts with less sound effects, instruments join in one by one more clearly, and an initial spoken countdown is absent.&lt;ref name="elsewolder4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsew.com/data/older4.htm|date=2003-09-24|title="Elsewhere": Earlier news updates: 2003|author=Lodewijks, Dennis|accessdate=2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same "Movement 1" was used as the title theme of reality TV series ''Der Maulwurf'' (lit. The Mole), which was broadcast by German station Pro7 in 2001. It was also used in the soundtracks of the trailers for the Hollywood films [[X-Men (film)|''X-Men'']] (2000) and ''[[The Scorpion King]]'' (2002).&lt;ref name="elsewolder3" /&gt; Finally, "Movement 9" is included in the compilation album ''Classic Kathleen Battle /A Portrait''.

== Video ==
A one-hour condensed edit of the concert was made available for broadcast by TV stations and later released on video, cutting the intervals and leaving just the first encore, for a total running time of 76 minutes. More significantly, the live playing and singing were replaced by the album version mixed with live applause, except the encore which retained the original full-live recording. The synchronization of the live performance with the album recording was achieved with a [[click track]] being played to the performers.

The DVD-Video and VHS were released on February 17, 2002.&lt;ref name="elsewolder3"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elsew.com/data/older3.htm |title= Dennis Lodewijks' Elsewhere |accessdate= 2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD featured PCM stereo and 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, 16:9 non-anamorphic image, and had as extras: artist biographies, "Making of ''Mythodea''", music video, an introduction by NASA, and written notes by Vangelis. The DVD-video reached gold status in Portugal, for over 14,000 sales.&lt;ref name="elsewolder3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1931">'''North American International Livestock Exposition''' (NAILE) is a [[livestock show]] held each November in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] and lasts for two weeks. It is billed as the "world's largest all-breed, purebred livestock exposition", with nine major livestock divisions with competitors from the 48 contiguous states.  These divisions are [[beef cattle]], [[Boer goat]]s, [[dairy cattle]], [[dairy goat]]s, [[draft horse]]s, quarter horses, [[llama]]s &amp; [[alpaca]]s, [[sheep]], and [[swine]]. A [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association|PRCA]] rodeo, the North American Championship Rodeo, is also held.

Visitors from 15 countries attend the Expo. Many of these go to the event to acquire purebred livestock [[semen]] and [[embryo]]s to export from the [[United States]].  This makes the event attractive to American "seedstock producers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Carly|last=Rakes|title=Money is not a matter with dairy goat enthusiasts at the NAILE|url=http://newsbug.info/articles/2007/11/06/rensselaer_republican/news/new03.txt|work=Rensselaer Republican|publisher=Newsbug.info|date=2009-01-13|accessdate=2009-04-29}}{{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events are held at the [[Kentucky Exposition Center]]. The giant expo was established in 1974. It is produced by the Commonwealth of Kentucky under the guidance of the Kentucky State Fair Board.

The [[Grateful Dead]] were an American rock band known for their lengthy, partially improvised performances, as well as for a loyal fan base who often followed the band for several shows or entire tours. They disbanded in 1995, following the death of de facto bandleader [[Jerry Garcia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joel |last=Selvin |date=December 9, 1995 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/PAGE-ONE-End-of-the-Road-for-Grateful-Dead-3017847.php |title=End of the Road for Grateful Dead – Without Garcia, Band Just Can't Keep Truckin' |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=July 28, 2017 |quote=Say goodbye to the Grateful Dead. The band announced yesterday that in the wake of guitarist Jerry Garcia's death, it will break up after playing together for 30 years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then remaining members have reunited for a number of concert tours and one-off performances, often in very different configurations. The following is a list of instances where former Grateful Dead members have reunited.

Other than Jerry Garcia, the Grateful Dead's main performing members were [[Bob Weir]], [[Phil Lesh]], [[Bill Kreutzmann]] and [[Mickey Hart]]. Garcia, Weir, Lesh and Kreutzmann were in the band from its inception in 1965 until its demise in 1995, while Hart had a tenure of 25 non-consecutive years. The other then-current or former members of the Grateful Dead who were living at the time that the band broke up were [[Vince Welnick]], [[Donna Jean Godchaux]], and [[Tom Constanten]].  Additionally, [[Bruce Hornsby]] was in the lineup for many Dead concerts and was considered an unofficial member of the band.  Already deceased in 1995 were [[Ron "Pigpen" McKernan]], [[Keith Godchaux]], and [[Brent Mydland]].

===The Other Ones===
{{Main|The Other Ones}}
*In 1998 guitarist [[Bob Weir]], bassist [[Phil Lesh]], drummer [[Mickey Hart]] and touring keyboardist [[Bruce Hornsby]] formed a band called the Other Ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=May 2012 |url=http://www.deaddisc.com/GDFD_Other_Ones.htm |title=The Other Ones |website=Grateful Dead Family Discography |access-date=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They toured America with guitarists [[Steve Kimock]] and [[Mark Karan]], saxophonist [[Dave Ellis (saxophonist)|Dave Ellis]], and drummer [[John Molo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ari |last=Bendersky |date=June 6, 1998 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5929573/former_dead_members_premiere_new_lineup_in_san_francisco |title=Former Dead Members Premiere New Lineup in San Francisco |website=Rolling Stone |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725132726/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5929573/former_dead_members_premiere_new_lineup_in_san_francisco |archive-date=July 25, 2009 |access-date=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A live album from this tour, ''[[The Strange Remain]]'', was released in 1999.
*In 2000 the Other Ones launched another tour featuring former Grateful Dead members Weir, Hart, Hornsby and drummer [[Bill Kreutzmann]]. Lesh declined to participate and was replaced by [[Alphonso Johnson]]. Steve Kimock and Mark Karan continued their roles as co-lead guitarists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Parrish |date=September 4, 2000 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-09-04/features/0009040258_1_mark-karan-grateful-dead-dead-bassist-phil-lesh |title=Other Ones' New Lineup Still Developing Identity |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |access-date=September 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the first time that Weir, Lesh, Kreutzmann, and Hart had toured together since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joel |last=Selvin |date=December 1, 2002 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Other-Ones-reunite-Former-Grateful-Dead-mates-2749192.php |title=Other Ones Reunite; Former Grateful Dead Mates Patch Things Up |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=September 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tony |last=Bonyata |date= |url=http://www.concertlivewire.com/otherones.htm |title=Grateful Dead's Long Strange Trip Carries On: Terrapin Station Featuring The Other Ones |website=Concert Live Wire |access-date=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Something Awful''' ('''SA''') is a [[comedy]] [[website]] housing a variety of content, including [[blog]] entries, [[Internet forum|forums]], feature articles, digitally edited pictures, and humorous media reviews. It was created by Richard "Lowtax" Kyanka in 1999 as a largely personal website, but as it grew, so did its contributors and content. The website has helped to perpetuate various [[Internet phenomenon|Internet phenomena]],&lt;ref name="tourist guy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tourist of Death|url=http://www.touristofdeath.com/|accessdate=November 24, 2006}}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ayb guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=All your base...|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4143466,00.html|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|date=February 28, 2001|accessdate=November 24, 2006 | location=London | first=Rich | last=Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ayb frogstar"&gt;{{cite web|title=All Your Base Are Belong To Frogstar|url=http://frogstar.com/aybabtu/aa-history.asp|accessdate=November 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been cited as an influence on [[Internet culture]].&lt;ref name = "G4"&gt;{{cite video | people = David Thorpe, [[Kevin Pereira]] | title = Somethingawful.com, Pink Five, Chris Gore | medium = television | publisher = G4 television | location = |date=July 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, [[Gizmodo]] placed it as 89th on their list of "100 Websites That Shaped the Internet as We Know It".&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/100-websites-that-shaped-the-internet-as-we-know-it-1829634771 100 Websites That Shaped the Internet as We Know It]&lt;/ref&gt;

The website has been involved in a number of notable events. These include a conflict with the [[Spam Prevention Early Warning System]], a [[Hurricane Katrina]] relief fund being caught in [[PayPal]]'s [[red tape]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.systemshock.co.za/forums/topic/1209-paypal-blocks-hurricane-relief-funds/|title=PayPal Blocks Hurricane Relief Funds|publisher=systemshock.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; an exhibition boxing match between Kyanka and movie director [[Uwe Boll]], and the creation of the [[Slenderman]].

==History==
Something Awful was created by Richard "Lowtax" Kyanka,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| last = Lynch

&lt;/ref&gt;
who controls the site and is supported by other contributing writers and administrators.

Kyanka started Something Awful several months before leaving his previous job, after using his "Cranky Steve" persona to write a comedic website update deriding the attitude and work performance of a fellow [[Planet Quake]] administrator. He moved the "Cranky Steve" personality he had created to the Something Awful site in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| url = http://www.somethingawful.com/d/daily-dirt/heres-mud-your.php
| date=May 10, 2005
| accessdate = May 10, 2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the years immediately following Something Awful's launch, several sponsors, including [[GameFan]] and [[eFront]], failed to compensate Kyanka as promised for advertising on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lowendmac.com/musings/express.html |title=Something Awful &amp; Express.com |accessdate= |author=Dan Knight |authorlink= |date=October 11, 2000 |work=Low End Mac}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedukeofurl.org/reviews/misc/efront/ |title=eFront: What Went Wrong? |accessdate= |author=Tim Johnson |date=March 13, 2001 |work=The Duke of URL |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020202083639/http://www.thedukeofurl.org/reviews/misc/efront/ |archivedate=February 2, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the site began charging an activation fee (currently [[United States dollar|US$]]9.95) for forum access.&lt;ref name="dgc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://media.www.dailygamecock.com/media/storage/paper247/news/2006/01/23/TheMix/Something.Awfully.Funny-1492616.shtml | title=Something awfully funny | accessdate=2007-02-13 | author=Jeremy Turnage |date=2006-01-23}}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only members can post messages or threads; to encourage new registrations, the forums are only intermittently viewable by unregistered users. The site and forums draw continuous income from fees for new accounts, forum upgrades such as custom avatars and access to the forum archives and search features, and merchandise sales.&lt;ref name="dgc" /&gt;

===Spam Prevention Early Warning System===
On July 20, 2003, the spam filtering organization [[Spam Prevention Early Warning System]] (SPEWS) added an entire class-B subnet with the [[Cogent Communications|Cogent]] ISP to their spammer list, since Cogent was hosting a known spammer that SPEWS found difficult to block.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010|reason=SPEWS was simply a list, not an ISP, therefore they couldn't block anyone else's traffic}} Something Awful was added to the list in the process, disrupting its ability to communicate with its customers who were using SPEWS. Upon appeal, SPEWS initially refused to delist SA. The Something Awful administrators responded by telling their users to post their support in the [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] ''news.admin.net-abuse.blocklisting''. However, that group and ''news.admin.net-abuse.email'' were flooded with off-topic posts and trolls from Something Awful users, incensing SPEWS advocates. The SA administrators claimed that SPEWS was attempting to hack the Something Awful server. Forum users responded by threatening to perform a [[distributed denial of service]] attack on SPEWS, although this type of behavior was strongly discouraged by Kyanka and assistant editor Zack Parsons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/08/08/something_awful_going/|title=Something Awful going on with SPEWS|author=John Leyden|date=2003-08-08|work=The Register|publisher=Situation Publishing Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurricane Katrina charity===
As the website's servers were located in [[New Orleans]], the site temporarily went offline in August 2005 during the [[2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans|flooding from Hurricane Katrina]]. After the site was brought to a semi-functional state, Kyanka set up a link to a [[PayPal]] account where people could donate money to the survivors of the hurricane via the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]]. Kyanka put in $3,000 of his own money,&lt;ref name="cyrus"&gt;{{cite news
| last = Farivar
| first = Cyrus

| date = 2005-09-08
| accessdate = 2018-05-27
| work = Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and promised to give some free merchandise to anyone who donated more than $10.{{citation needed|reason=previous citation dead.|date=March 2015}}
PayPal froze the donation account, then stated that they would unfreeze the account once it was provided with proof of shipping from aggrieved buyers. Due to the nature of the collection, there were no actual "buyers", and it was impossible to provide proof of shipping for donation.&lt;ref name="inquirer"&gt;{{cite news
| last = Demerjian
| first = Charlie

| date = 2005-09-04
| accessdate = 2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Kyanka contacted a customer service representative over the phone, and asked to have PayPal donate all of the money to the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]]. However, he was told that PayPal would only give the money to [[United Way of America]] due to their business affiliation; Kyanka initially agreed, but after receiving several emails from readers detailing alleged corruption and inefficiency within United Way, he changed his mind and told PayPal to refund all of the money to the individual donors. PayPal refunded the money, but did not refund exchange and handling fees for international donors.&lt;ref name="cyrus"/&gt;

===Shooting deaths===
In 2005, William Freund sought advice in the Something Awful gun subforum about purchasing Hevi-Shot brand [[ammunition]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=1704519|title=Something Awful forum post}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{subscription required}} several days before embarking on a "shooting rampage", during which he killed two people before committing suicide. Freund had stated in the thread, which was closed before the killing spree, along with his ability to post comments being revoked, that he intended to use the ammunition to defend his Halloween pumpkins from vandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/06/local/me-cyberlife6/2|title=The Cyber World Shut Out O.C. Loner Too|newspaper=LA Times|date=6 November 2005|author=Kimi Yoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uwe Boll fight===
{{see also|Uwe Boll#Critic boxing matches (Raging Boll)}}
In June 2006, Kyanka accepted an open challenge from German movie director [[Uwe Boll]], who had offered to fight critics of his movies in a series of 10-round boxing matches. Something Awful had posted a humorous review that was critical of one of his films.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The event took place in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] on September 23, 2006; after being knocked down several times and eventually forfeiting the fight in the first round, Kyanka claimed that he had been told by Boll, a trained amateur boxer, that the fight would be just for show.  To that effect, Kyanka purportedly acted like a silent film comedy character during the fight rather than seriously attempting to fight Uwe Boll.&lt;ref&gt;

==Site content==
The frontpage article series ''[[Golan the Insatiable]]'' is the basis of an animated series of the same name that premiered on [[Animation Domination]] on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on July 27, 2013.&lt;ref name="ksitetv"&gt;{{cite web |first=Craig |last=Byrne |url=http://www.ksitetv.com/glee/fox-announces-season-finale-dates-summer-premieres/20207 |title=FOX Announces Season Finale Dates &amp; Summer Premieres |work=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] |publisher=KSiteTV |date=February 28, 2013 |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Slender Man]] [[urban legend]] was created on a thread in the Something Awful forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/images-from-slender-man-stabbing-suspects-notebook-surface-20150219|title=Images From Slender Man Stabbing Suspect's Notebook Surface|last=Blistein|first=Jon|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=February 19, 2015|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forums===
The site is home to a collection of [[Internet forum]]s running a highly customized version of [[vBulletin]], charging a one-time registration fee of US$9.95 for posting privileges and full access to the forums, with additional user account and forum features available for purchase at prices ranging from US$4.95 to US$29.95.&lt;ref name="alberto"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://secure.somethingawful.com | title=Something Awful Secure Purchase System | accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forums have spread several [[Internet memes]], such as [[all your base are belong to us]].&lt;ref name="ayb guardian"/&gt; The forum's users refer to themselves as "Goons". A weekly activity is "Photoshop Phriday", where users will modify existing images to create parodies through the use of image-editing software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]].&lt;ref name="photoshop phriday"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.somethingawful.com/d/photoshop-phriday/ | title = Photoshop Phriday | publisher = Something Awful | accessdate = 2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website also highlights some of what its administrators believe to be exceptional forum threads in the Comedy Goldmine feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.somethingawful.com/d/comedy-goldmine/ | title = Comedy Goldmine | publisher = Something Awful | accessdate = 2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A forum member also launched [[4chan]],&lt;ref name="TheStar"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/living/article/257955|title=Funny how `stupid' site is addictive|publisher=''[[Toronto Star|The Toronto Star]]''|author=Jerry Langton|date=2007-09-22|accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] phenomenon originated in posts on the Something Awful forums.

In 2014, the [[American Folklife Center]] announced that Something Awful was one of the sites it would be archiving as part of its efforts to compile a history of digital culture.&lt;ref name=LoC&gt;[http://blogs.loc.gov/folklife/2014/06/getting-serious-about-collecting-and-preserving-digital-culture/ Getting serious about collecting and preserving digital culture], by Nicole Saylor, at ''Folklife Today'' (at the [[Library of Congress]]); published June 5, 2014; retrieved December 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 video game ''[[Dropsy (video game)|Dropsy]]'' originated as a 2008 [[Choose Your Own Adventure|CYOA]] thread on the Something Awful forums.

A '''Sunday School'''  is an [[educational institution]], usually (but not always) [[Christian]], which catered to children and other young people who would be working on weekdays.
Sunday Schools were first set up in the 1780s in England to provide education to working children.&lt;ref name="MSS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Louanne|title=Macclesfield Sunday School 1796- 1996|publisher=Macclesfield Museums Trust|location=Macclesfield, Cheshire|year=1996|isbn=1-870926-09-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; William King (see memorial in Dursley Tabernacle Church) first started a Sunday School in Dursley, Gloucestershire, and suggested to his friend [[Robert Raikes]], that he start a similar school in Gloucester, which resulted in Raikes generally being quoted as starting the schools.  Raikes was editor of the Gloucester Journal.  He wrote an article in his journal, and as a result many clergymen supported the schools, which aimed to teach the youngsters reading, writing, cyphering (doing arithmetic) and a knowledge of the Bible.&lt;ref name=Dav&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Stella|title=History of Macclesfield|publisher=E.J.Morten|location=Didsbury, Manchester and Macclesfield|year=1961|edition=Reprint 1976|isbn=0-85972-034-9|pages=219–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1785, 250,000 English children were attending Sunday School.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; There were 5,000 in Manchester alone. By 1235, the 'Society for the Establishment and Promotion of Sunday Schools' had distributed 91,915 spelling books, 24,232 Testaments and 5,360 Bibles.&lt;ref name="MSS"/&gt; The Sunday School movement was cross-denominational, and through subscription built large buildings that could host public lectures as well as classrooms. In the early days, adults would attend the same classes as the infants, as each was instructed in basic reading. In some towns, the [[Methodists]] withdrew from the large Sunday School and built their own. The [[Anglican]]s set up their own 'National' schools that would act as Sunday Schools and day schools.&lt;ref name="MSS"/&gt; These schools were the precursors to a national system of education.&lt;ref name=Dav/&gt;

The role of the Sunday Schools changed with the [[Education Act 1870]].&lt;ref name=Dav/&gt;  In the 1920s they promoted sports. It was common for teams to compete in a Sunday School League. They were social centres hosting amateur dramatics and concert parties.&lt;ref name="MSS"/&gt; By the 1960s, the term Sunday School could refer to the building and not to any education classes. By the 1970s even the largest Sunday School at [[Stockport Sunday School|Stockport]] had been demolished. Sunday School became the generic name for many different types of [[religious education]] pursued and conducted on [[Sunday]]s by various denominations.

===United Kingdom===
The first Sunday school may have been opened in 1751 in [[St Mary's Church, Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nottinghamchurches.org/heritage/stm-heritage/stm-history/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705035038/http://www.nottinghamchurches.org/heritage/stm-heritage/stm-history/ |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early start was made by [[Hannah Ball]], a native of [[High Wycombe]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], who founded a school there in 1769.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gracemagazine.org.uk/articles/historical/raikes.htm | title = Robert Raikes and the Sunday School Movement | accessdate = 2007-10-26 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071008143459/http://www.gracemagazine.org.uk/articles/historical/raikes.htm | archivedate = 2007-10-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pioneer of Sunday schools is commonly, though wrongly, said to be [[Robert Raikes]], editor of the ''Gloucester Journal'', who saw the need to prevent children in the slums from descending into crime.

In 18th-century England education was reserved for a minority and was [[compulsory education|not compulsory]]. The wealthy educated their children privately at home, with hired [[governess]]es or tutors for younger children. Boys of that class were often sent away to [[boarding school]], hence these fee-based educational establishments were known, confusingly, as [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public schools]]. The town-based middle class may have sent their sons to [[grammar school]]s, while daughters were left to learn what they could from their mothers or from their fathers' libraries. The children of factory workers and farm labourers received no formal education, and typically worked alongside their parents six days a week, sometimes for more than 13 hours a day.

In 1781, after prompting from his friend William King who was already running a Sunday School in Dursley, Raikes saw the plight of children living in the Gloucester slums. In the home of a Mrs Meredith he opened a school on Sunday, the only day the boys and girls living in the slums and working in the factories could attend. Using the Bible as their textbook, he taught them to read and write.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Towns, Elmer L., "History of Sunday School", Sunday School Encyclopedia, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Within four years over 250,000 children were attending schools on Sunday throughout England.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  In 1784  many new schools opened, including the interdenominational [[Stockport Sunday School]], which financed and constructed a school for 5,000 scholars in 1805. In the late 19th century this was accepted as being the largest in the world.  By 1831 it was reported that attendance at Sunday schools had grown to 1.2 million.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Robert Raikes's schools were seen as the precursors of the English state system.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/thefirstfiftyyea00watsuoft/thefirstfiftyyea00watsuoft_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "The first fifty years of the Sunday school"|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Sunday school in London opened at [[Surrey Chapel]] under [[Rowland Hill (preacher)|Rowland Hill]]. By 1831 Sunday schools in Great Britain were attended weekly by 1,250,000 children, or about 25 per cent of the eligible population.  They provided basic lessons in literacy alongside religious instruction. 

In 1833, "for the unification and progress of the work of religious education among the young", the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] founded their Sunday School Association, as "junior partner" to the [[British and Foreign Unitarian Association]], with which it eventually set up offices at [[Essex Hall]] in [[Central London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Rowe|1959|loc=chpt. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Sunday schools in the industrial cities was increasingly supplemented by "[[ragged schools]]" (charitable provision for the industrial poor), and eventually by publicly funded education under the late 19th-century school boards. Sunday schools continued alongside such increasing educational provision, and new forms also developed such as the [[Socialist Sunday Schools]] movement, which began in the United Kingdom in the late 19th century.

===Ireland===
The earliest recorded Sunday School programme in Ireland goes back to 1777 when Roman Catholic priest Daniel Delany - later (1787) Bishop [[Daniel Delany]] of Kildare and Leighlin - started a school in Tullow, County Carlow.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, Russell, “Sketches in Irish Biography, No. 28, Dr. Daniel Delany”, ''The Irish Monthly'', Volume 23, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a very sophisticated system which involved timetables, lesson plans, streaming, and various teaching activities.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Martin Brenan, ''Schools of Kildare and Leighlin, A.D. 1775 - 1835'', M.H. Gill and Son, Ltd, Dublin, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; This system spread to other parishes in the diocese. By 1787 in Tullow alone there were 700 students, boys and girls, men and women, and 80 teachers. The primary intent of this Sunday School system was the teaching of the Catholic faith; the teaching of reading and writing became necessary to assist in this.  With the coming of Catholic Emancipation in Ireland (1829) and the establishment of the National School system (1831), which meant that the Catholic faith could be taught in school, the Catholic Sunday School system became unnecessary.

The [[Church of Ireland]] Sunday School Society was founded in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sundayschoolsociety.ie/sunday-school-society/|title=About the Sunday School Society|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sabbath School Society of the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]] was founded in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;John M Barkley, ''The Sabbath School Society for Ireland, 1862 - 1962'' (Sabbath School Society for Ireland, 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Sunday school at the Baptist church which is not on company property and was built by the miners. Lejunior, Harlan... - NARA - 541342.jpg|thumb|Sunday school at a Baptist church in [[Kentucky]], US, 1946]]
The American Sunday school system was first begun by [[Samuel Slater]] in his textile mills in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, in the 1790s. Notable 20th-century leaders in the American Sunday School movement include: Clarence Herbert Benson, [[Henrietta Mears]], founder of  Gospel Light,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gospellight.com|title=Welcome - Gospel Light|website=www.gospellight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Gene A. Getz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibleprinciples.org/about-gene/|title=About Gene - Bible Principles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Hendricks]], Lois E. LeBar, Lawrence O. Richards and [[Elmer Towns]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Philanthropist [[Lewis Miller (philanthropist)|Lewis Miller]] was the inventor of the "[[Akron Plan]]" for Sunday schools, a building layout with a central assembly hall surrounded by small classrooms, conceived with Methodist minister [[John Heyl Vincent]] and architect [[Jacob Snyder]].

[[John Heyl Vincent]] collaborating was Baptist layman B. F. Jacobs, who devised a system to encourage Sunday school work, and a committee was established to provide the International Uniform Lesson Curriculum, also known as the "Uniform Lesson Plan". By the 1800s 80% of all new members were introduced to the church through Sunday school.&lt;ref&gt;"Sunday School Movement", Dictionary of Christianity in America, InterVarsity Press, 1990, p 1147&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, interested in improving the training of Sunday school teachers for the Uniform Lesson Plan, Miller and Vincent worked together again to found what is now the [[Chautauqua Institution]] on the shores of Chautauqua Lake, New York.

==Form==
[[File:Sundayschool1900.jpg|thumb|Sunday school, Indians and whites. Indian Territory (Oklahoma), US, c. 1900.]]
Sunday schools, contrary to the name, are virtually never recognized as educational institutions; rather than offering formal grades or transcripts, Sunday schools simply attempt to offer meaningful instruction concerning Christian [[doctrine]] and keep little or no record of performance for any given week. Attendance is often tracked as a means of encouraging children to attend regularly, and awards are frequently given for reaching attendance milestones.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Historically, Sunday Schools were held in the afternoons in various communities, and were often staffed by workers from varying denominations. Beginning in the United States in the early 1930s, and Canada in the 1940s, the transition was made to Sunday mornings. Sunday school often takes the form of a one-hour or longer [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] which can occur before, during, or after a [[church service]]. While many Sunday schools are focused on providing instruction for children (especially those sessions occurring during service times), adult Sunday-school classes are also popular and widespread (see [[RCIA]]). In some traditions, the term "Sunday school" is too strongly associated with children, and alternate terms such as "Adult Electives" or "religious education" are used instead of "Adult Sunday school". Some churches only operate Sunday school for children concurrently with the adult worship service. In this case, there is typically no adult Sunday school.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

A number of traditional children's hymns or "Sunday school songs", such as "[[The Wise Man Built His House Upon the Rock]]," "[[Jesus Bids Us Shine]]", and "[[Jesus Loves Me]]" have frequently been used in Sunday-school settings.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Uniform==
It is rare nowadays, but some Sunday schools required children to wear a uniform. This usually consisted of a dress shirt and necktie, with v-neck sweater for boys. For girls it would usually be a skirt with blouse and sometimes also a tie.

==Publishers==
In Great Britain an agency was formed called the [[Religious Tract Society]] which helped provide literature for the Sunday School.
In the United States the [[American Sunday School Union]] was formed (headquartered in New York City) for the publication of literature. This group helped pioneer what became known as the International Sunday School Lessons.  The ''Sunday School Times'' was another periodical they published for the use of Sunday schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Little, Ellen|title=Periodicals published by The American Sunday-School Union|publisher=University Library System, University of Pittsburgh|url=http://www.library.pitt.edu/libraries/is/enroom/ASSU/assu_per.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204053406/http://www.library.pitt.edu/libraries/is/enroom/ASSU/assu_per.html|archivedate=4 February 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[LifeWay Christian Resources]], [[Gospel Light Publications|Gospel Light]]'', [[David C Cook]], and [[Group Publishing]]  are among the widely available published resources currently used in Sunday schools across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Anderson, Don|title=Choosing Sunday School Curriculum: How Effectively Do You Want to Teach the Bible?|publisher=Faith.edu|url=http://www.faith.edu/resources/publications/faith-pulpit/message/choosing-sunday-school-curriculum-how-effectively-do-you-want-to-teach-the-bible/read|date=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachers==
Sunday school teachers are usually [[Laity|lay people]] who are selected for their role in the church by a designated coordinator, board, or a committee.  Normally, the selection is based on a perception of character and ability to teach the Bible rather than formal training in education. Some Sunday school teachers, however, do have a background in [[education]] as a result of their occupations. Some churches require Sunday school teachers and catechists to attend courses to ensure that they have a sufficient understanding of the faith and of the teaching process to educate others.  Other churches allow volunteers to teach without training; a profession of faith and a desire to teach is all that is required in such cases.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

It is also not uncommon for [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Roman Catholic priests]] or [[Protestant]] [[pastors]] ([[Minister of religion|church ministers]]) to teach such classes themselves. Some well-known public figures who teach, or have taught, Sunday school include astronaut [[Ron Garan]], comedian [[Stephen Colbert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] – which was broadcast [[Live television|live]] on February 1, 2004 from [[Houston]], [[Texas]] on the [[CBS]] television network in the [[United States]] – was noted for a controversial [[halftime show]] in which [[Janet Jackson]]'s [[breast]], adorned with a [[Nipple shield (jewelry)|nipple shield]], was exposed by [[Justin Timberlake]] for about half a second, in what was later referred to as a "[[wardrobe malfunction]]".&lt;ref name="apologeticjackson"&gt;{{cite news|title=Janet Jackson Apologizes for Bared Breast |url=http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/S/SUPER_BOWL_JACKSON?SITE=MAHYC&amp;SECTION=BUSINESS&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|author=Nekesa Mumbi Moody|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=February 3, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040203025228/http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/S/SUPER_BOWL_JACKSON?SITE=MAHYC&amp;SECTION=BUSINESS&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|archivedate=February 3, 2004}} Also published by CNN.com as "[http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/02/02/superbowl.jackson/ Apologetic Jackson says 'costume reveal' went awry]".&lt;/ref&gt; The incident, sometimes referred to as '''Nipplegate''',&lt;ref name="jacksonresponsible"&gt;{{cite news|title=Spike Lee says Janet Jackson's breast baring a 'new low' for entertainers|url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/features/20040204-0213-superbowl-jackson.html|author=David Bauder|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=[[U-T San Diego]]|date=February 4, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040411114159/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20040204-0213-superbowl-jackson.html|archivedate=April 11, 2004}} CNN.com published this story in an earlier version as "[http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/02/04/jackson.apology.ap/index.html Janet Jackson takes responsibility for breast-baring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231165752/http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/02/04/jackson.apology.ap/index.html |date=2007-12-31 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hilden2004-02-20"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jackson 'Nipplegate' illustrates the danger of chilling free speech|author=Julie Hilden|publisher=CNN|date=February 20, 2004|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/02/20/findlaw.analysis.hilden.jackson/|accessdate=July 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was widely discussed.

==Background and development==
In 2002, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reported that Jackson was the original choice to perform at the halftime show for [[Super Bowl XXXVI]], however the NFL ultimately decided to select [[U2]] to headline it after a group of NFL owners and officials attended the band's concert in [[New York City]] shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pro Bono Work: Carey, McCartney and U2|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,252449,00.html|author=Josh Young|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=February 15, 2002|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2003, the NFL announced that Jackson would be the headline performer of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The NFL and CBS Look to MTV to Produce the AOL Super Bowl XXXVIII Halftime Show|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-nfl-and-cbs-look-to-mtv-to-produce-the-aol-super-bowl-xxxviii-halftime-show-73262057.html|agency=[[PR Newswire]]|date=September 12, 2003|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the event was occurring during [[United States presidential election, 2004|an election year]], MTV decided that the show's theme would heavily focus on the network's "[[MTV#Choose or Lose|Choose or Lose]]" campaign, which encouraged younger viewers to be politically active and register to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Lane|2006|pp=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the incident, Timberlake had attended Jackson's ''[[Rhythm Nation Tour]]'' as an [[adolescence|adolescent]], and Jackson's energetic dance routines and daring performing style made a deep impression on him.&lt;ref name=biography&gt;{{cite book|title=Justin: The Unauthorized Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cki-FYnGCu8C&amp;pg=PA184|author=Sean Smith|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|page=184|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Timberlake was a member of pop group [['N Sync]], Jackson selected the [[boy band]] as the opening act for many dates of her blockbuster ''[[Velvet Rope Tour|Velvet Rope World Tour]]'', which helped promote and introduce the then-relatively unknown group and Timberlake to the public worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Janet Extends Velvet Rope|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430407/janet-extends-velvet-rope.jhtml|publisher=[[MTV News]]|date=August 9, 1998|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timberlake said he was "psyched" and later described the experience as "fulfilling".&lt;ref name=velvet/&gt;&lt;ref name=chat&gt;{{cite web|title=*N Sync Me: Transcript of chat with Justin|url=http://nsyncme.tripod.com/yahoojustin2.html|publisher=Tripod|date=March 18, 1999|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While on the tour, Jackson further promoted the group by performing with 'N Sync on several dates, including joining the group for a live [[a cappella]] duet of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "[[Overjoyed (Stevie Wonder song)|Overjoyed]]", which a biography stated was a "highlight" moment for Timberlake which "gave Justin a chance to show his family and friends how far he had come".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Justin: The Unauthorized Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cki-FYnGCu8C&amp;pg=PA112|author=Sean Smith|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page=112|date=January 11, 2005|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became "good friends", with Jackson also praising Timberlake.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Justin: The Unauthorized Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cki-FYnGCu8C&amp;pg=PA189|author=Sean Smith|work=Simon &amp; Schuster|date=January 11, 2005|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timberlake recreated Jackson's "[[That's the Way Love Goes (Janet Jackson song)|That's the Way Love Goes]]" video with 'N Sync and was inspired by Jackson's performing style.&lt;ref name=laweekly&gt;{{cite web|title=Fear of a Black Titty|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2004-05-06/music/fear-of-a-black-titty/|author=Ernest Hardy|work=[[LA Weekly]]|page=1|date=June 5, 2004|accessdate=December 25, 2013| archivedate=May 4, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160504022131/http://www.laweekly.com/music/fear-of-a-black-titty-2138203| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timberlake had frequently mentioned admiring Jackson in many interviews during this time and throughout the following few years preceding the incident.&lt;ref name=velvet&gt;{{cite web|title='N Sync Describes Hooking Up With Janet Jackson|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430406/n-sync-describes-hooking-up-with-janet-jackson.jhtml|publisher=MTV News|date=August 10, 1998|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chat Transcripts: Justin|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ny2/nsyncandbsboysrfyne/justinchat.html|publisher=[[Angelfire]]|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked who he thought was "the sexiest woman on the planet", Timberlake had said "I've thought Janet Jackson has nothing but [[sex appeal]], so I'd probably say her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justin article|url=http://www.angelfire.com/me2/NSYNCLane/justinarticle.html|publisher=Angelfire|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timberlake later asked Jackson to sing backing vocals on "(And She Said) Take Me Now", a song from his debut solo album ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'' which was initially planned to be released as a single, commenting "I wrote the chorus from a girl's perspective, and I just thought we should get a female on the part. Her name was the first that popped up in my head just because I love her voice. It sounds like feathers.

Salli Frattini, the executive producer for MTV who had planned the entire performance, recalled a phone call from the officiating booth that was her first indication something had gone wrong. Frattini was in a truck outside of Reliant Stadium celebrating the end of the 12-minute halftime performance, which they initially thought was a success. "We were like, 'Uh, we’re playing that back right now'", Frattini said. "There was lots of chaos in the truck, and we played it back and we were like, 'Oh, s[hit].&lt;!--original source read "s---"--&gt; What just happened?'" Alex Coletti, another MTV producer, said he could not find Jackson after the performance. "I tried to get in touch to make sure she was okay", he said. "Her entire camp stopped answering the phones. I finally got to her tour manager, and they were already at the airport." Coletti assumed the singer was so mortified that she fled immediately, though later assumed the incident was a possible "set up", adding it was the last time he had spoken to her. Coletti's assumption is potentially another reason for Jackson's blacklisting on MTV in addition to other music channels and radio formats.&lt;ref name=powell/&gt; An MTV representative confirmed the costume tear was conceptualized by the MTV staff, in which the show's producers mockingly ripped their clothing in response to Timberlake's closing lyric during rehearsals. This led to Jackson and Timberlake improvising the move, in which Timberlake tore off Jackson's kilt. Frattini stated, "When we did the original rehearsal, there was conversation about a fake skirt she would wear, and that Justin would actually pull open the skirt and take off the skirt. In rehearsal, they actually tried to rip open the skirt, which kind of went with the lyrics of the song".&lt;ref name=cogin/&gt; The production team then discussed another option, which led to the costume tearing, although the outfit was intended to stay in place.&lt;ref name=cogin/&gt;

I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived."

Michael Musto of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' commented on the media's reaction to the incident, saying, "Janet became a symbolic [[Joan of Arc]] to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast was used as a diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from [[Iraq War|Iraq]] specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by.

In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me.

===Media diversion===
Jackson suspected ulterior motives in the media's reaction, expressing, "It was just perfect timing to take people's focus off of other things. That's what happens, and it happened to me."&lt;ref name=usatoday.com/&gt; Accounts from several university leaders and management groups offered a similar premise. Michael Rich, director of [[Harvard University|Harvard]]'s Center on Media and Child Health, exclaimed, "Here we have Michael Powell upset about the happening in the Super Bowl, but the same Powell has been unwilling to do anything about the [[Media violence research|violence on television]], where there has been much more research showing it has a harmful impact on kids." Robert Thompson, founding director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at [[Syracuse University]], said, "Michael Powell is representing the Super Bowl like everybody in the family sits around knitting booties, or like, it's the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade|Macy's Day Parade]]. [...] Come on. There's gambling, there's a lot of drinking, partying, a carnival atmosphere", he asserted. Jay Rosenthal, attorney for the [[Recording Artists' Coalition]], says the FCC's involvement was a smoke-screen, or a "[[sound bite]] attempt" by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-led commission to act as if it's doing something. "When it comes to [[media consolidation]] issues affecting consumers and artists, they don't care about that. But when it comes to indecency, after ignoring it for years, all of a sudden they're snapping to attention", he said. Simon Renshaw of management group [[The Firm, Inc.|The Firm]] stated it to be "inappropriate" that Powell is trying to distract people from the real issues of what's currently going on in the media. "What I find offensive is CBS' refusal to carry [[MoveOn.org]]'s ad during the Super Bowl", which pictured children working in factories to pay off the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s budget deficit.&lt;ref name=diversion&gt;{{cite web|title=A Flash of Political Opportunism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uw8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=February 14, 2004|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Boston Legal]]'' episode "Let Sales Ring" likened the incident to being used as a distraction, portraying a news corporation which used the mishap to attract attention over other important events in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Word - BL01x16.doc|url=http://www.boston-legal.org/script/bl01x16.pdf|work=Boston Legal|year=2005|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Kreps of ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' explained, "For the FCC, Nipplegate provided an opportunity to restore order and flex whatever power they had left. Faced with lax broadcast standards for [[cable television|cable TV]] and [[satellite radio]], as well as the absolute lawlessness of the Internet, the FCC becomes hell-bent on preserving common decency in the family-friendly realm of network television. Thus, screws are tightened everywhere under the body's jurisdiction: Tape delays are lengthened and more frequent and sexually suggestive performances are replaced by less provocative selections. While the aftermath of Nipplegate starts to fade, the FCC will continue to carry its torch for the next half-decade."&lt;ref name=kreps/&gt; Cynthia Fuchs of ''[[Popmatters]]'' stated, "It behooves TV producers and consumers to focus their attentions on significant "news", rather than the daily distractions offered up by politicians, performers, professional [[Spin (public relations)|spinners]], and journalists. Janet is not that person you watch on TV. And neither is anyone else."&lt;ref name=popmatters&gt;{{cite news|title=Distraction TV|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/040419-janetjackson/|author=Cynthia Fuchs|work=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=April 19, 2004|date=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powell's response===
A decade after the incident, former FCC chairman Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown. Powell stated, "I think we've been removed from this long enough for me to tell you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on. Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and my job is to enforce the rules, but, you know, really? This is what we're gonna do?" Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing "an outrageous stunt", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash. "I personally thought that was really unfair", he said. "It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it’s Justin ripping off her [[breastplate]]."&lt;ref name=powell&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Beginning, There Was a Nipple | url= http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/10333439/wardrobe-malfunction-beginning-there-was-nipple|work=[[ESPN The Magazine]] | first=Marin|last= Cogan|date=January 28, 2014|accessdate=June 27, 2016| archivedate=January 28, 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140128191518/http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/10333439/wardrobe-malfunction-beginning-there-was-nipple | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[South Park]]'' (aired on [[Comedy Central]], a sister network to CBS at the time, and to MTV through Viacom) took aim at the hysteria in its eighth season premiere, "[[Good Times with Weapons]]", on March 17 of that year when [[Eric Cartman]] sneaks across a stage in the nude and later blames the incident on a "wardrobe malfunction". The townspeople are angered by Cartman's display, rather than feeling concern for a badly injured and disoriented character ([[Butters Stotch|Butters]]) who is also present on stage – a reference to the American culture's acceptance of violence while maintaining a taboo against nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Secrets of 'Good Times With Weapons'|url=http://www.spscriptorium.com/Season8/E801secrets.htm|publisher=Spscriptorium.com|accessdate=November 29, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619205632/http://www.spscriptorium.com/Season8/E801secrets.htm|archivedate=June 19, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2004 [[MTV Video Music Awards]], comedian [[Dave Chappelle]] joked that his appearance on the VMAs was "the biggest mistake [MTV made] since [they] put Janet Jackson on the Super Bowl."&lt;ref name="toned down"&gt;{{cite web|title=Toned Down Awards Shows|url=http://archive.mr.org/BozellColumns/entertainmentcolumn/2004/col20040902.asp|author=L.

The FCC's sudden crackdown on indecent material on television leads an angered [[Peter Griffin]] to start his own network with looser content standards, PTV, on which later in the same episode, he presents a show called the "Side Boob Hour" which among other risque programs he puts on leads his objected wife [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] to call the FCC to crack down on PTV (leading to the implication of the FCC also regulating what his family says and does).

The halftime show continued to be a subject of discussion in 2005. At the beginning of 2005, the parody newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'' ran as its headline article for January 26, 2005, "U.S. Children Still Traumatized One Year After Seeing Partially Exposed Breast On TV". The article's satirical target was the nation's reaction to the incident, rather than the incident itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Children Still Traumatized One Year After Seeing Partially Exposed Breast On TV|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/30883|work=[[The Onion]]|date=January 26, 2005|accessdate=November 29, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223085304/http://www.theonion.com/content/node/30883|archivedate=February 23, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 1, 2005, exactly one year after the halftime show, the PTC released a report titled ''MTV Smut Peddlers: Targeting Kids with Sex, Drugs, and Alcohol'', covering MTV programming during the network's "Spring Break" week from March 20 to 27, 2004, accusing MTV of irresponsibly promoting sex, drugs and alcohol to impressionable youth. In response to the report, MTV network executive Jeannie Kedas argued that the report "underestimates young people's intellect and their level of sophistication."&lt;ref name="doesnt want"&gt;{{cite news|title=PTC Doesn't Want its MTV|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/500535-PTC_Doesnt_Want_Its_MTV.php|author=John Eggerton|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=February 1, 2005|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 6, however, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' columnist [[Frank Rich]] argued that censorship on television was becoming more prevalent following the halftime show in his February 6, 2005 column "The Year of Living Indecently". Examples he cited included more than 60 ABC-affiliated stations (including those owned by the [[E. W. Scripps Company]], [[Hearst Television|Hearst-Argyle Television]] and [[Cox Media Group|Cox Broadcasting]]) refusing to broadcast ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' due to the [[profanity]] prevalent throughout the film, which was to be aired unedited in its entirety by the network, and [[PBS]] editing obscene language out of certain programs such as the British terrorist drama ''[[Dirty War (film)|Dirty War]]''.&lt;ref name="year of living indecently"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Year of Living Indecently|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/06/arts/06rich.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|author=[[Frank Rich]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 6, 2005|accessdate=November 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ESPN]] series ''[[Playmakers]]'' was also immediately forced to be canceled by the NFL following the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PRO FOOTBALL; Citing N.F.L., ESPN Cancels 'Playmakers'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/05/sports/pro-football-citing-nfl-espn-cancels-playmakers.html|author=Richard Sandomir|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 2, 2004|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington Redskins: Spin Control Can't Save Dan Snyder from Bringing Down NFL|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1810475-washington-redskins-spin-control-cant-save-dan-snyder-from-bringing-down-nfl|author=Stephen Sonneveld|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=October 14, 2013|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commercial from [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], which depicted a man opening a beverage on the outfit's breastplate and tearing it before it was worn, was intended to be aired during [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] the following year, but was pulled before its broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budweiser 'Wardrobe Malfunction' Ad pulled from Superbowl [sic] but available via Wizbang|url=http://wizbangblog.com/content/2005/01/28/budweiser-wardr.php|work=Wizbang|date=January 26, 2005|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=Budweiser: "Wardrobe Malfunction" Ad|id=xC3o-M1UgtA}} {{Retrieved|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], where the Super Bowl telecast was broadcast by the [[Global Television Network]], the incident passed largely without controversy: only about 50 Canadians complained about the incident to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= |url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/cbscdocs/submissions/BroadcasterMarchApril04.pdf |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529013751/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/cbscdocs/submissions/BroadcasterMarchApril04.pdf |archivedate=May 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBSC received roughly twice as many complaints about other aspects of the Super Bowl broadcast, including music and advertising issues (though some were expected complaints about [[Canadian content]]/[[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] issues preventing viewing of the popular American advertisements, which is a common issue among Canadian viewers of the Super Bowl to the present day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBSC Annual Report 2003-2004 |url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/cbscdocs/annreports/CBSC_Annual_Report_2003-2004.pdf |publisher=Canadian Broadcast Standards Council |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705073114/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/cbscdocs/annreports/CBSC_Annual_Report_2003-2004.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Robert Thompson (professor)|Robert Thompson]], director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at [[Syracuse University]], stated: "I know many people in other countries are scratching their heads and thinking 'What in the world is the big fuss over there?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US apoplexy over Jackson flash|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3456497.stm|author=Peter Bowes|publisher=BBC News|date=February 4, 2004|accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
New Zealand news outlets re-broadcast the "nipplegate" moment (some in slow motion) with commentary explaining that American ultra-conservatives had made the incident into a major controversy. The nation's largest newspaper, the New Zealand Herald, ran an op-ed from a New Zealander living in the US detailing his bafflement at his American friends, who had expressed outrage at the glimpse of nipple while supporting their country's invasion of Iraq and being fans of the television show ''[[Sex and the City]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=3547932|title=Roger Franklin:  Double standards rife in America's fickle society - World - NZ Herald News|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal action===
On February 4, Terri Carlin, a banker residing in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Tennessee]], filed a [[class action]] lawsuit against Jackson and Timberlake on behalf of "all American citizens who watched the outrageous conduct". The lawsuit alleged that the halftime show contained "sexually explicit acts solely designed to garner publicity and, ultimately, to increase profits for themselves". The lawsuit sought maximum [[punitive damages|punitive]] and compensatory damages from the performers. Carlin later dropped the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="CNN-Carlin"&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman drops lawsuit over Super Bowl halftime show |url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/apnews/stories/021004/D80KH9900.shtml |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=Jacksonville Times-Union |date=February 10, 2004 |accessdate=July 27, 2007 }} Also published on CNN.com as "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070706171736/http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/02/10/jackson.fallout.ap/index.html Woman drops lawsuit over Jackson peep show]".&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, Eric Stephenson, a lawyer from [[Farmington, Utah|Farmington]], [[Utah]], filed a US$5,000 lawsuit in [[small-claims court]] against Viacom for [[false advertising]] of the Super Bowl halftime show, as he, the father of three young children, claimed that pre-game advertising led him to believe that the halftime show would consist of [[marching band]]s, balloons and a patriotic celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Janet's exposure prompts lawsuit|url=http://www.sltrib.com/2004/May/05222004/utah/168709.asp|author=Elizabeth Neff|newspaper=[[Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=May 22, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603025907/http://www.sltrib.com/2004/May/05222004/utah/168709.asp|archivedate=June 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was rejected because Stephenson should have filed a [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] lawsuit or complaint to the FCC, which was already investigating the halftime show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Attorney loses lawsuit over Super Bowl show|agency=Associated Press|date=May 27, 2004}} Also published by Yahoo!

[[AOL|America Online]], the [[Internet service provider]] that sponsored the halftime show, demanded a refund of the approximately US$7.5 million that it paid to sponsor and advertise on the halftime show. However, no other advertisers of the Super Bowl had similar demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AOL demands $10m refund after Jackson mishap|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article1012828.ece|author=Nic Hopkins|newspaper=[[The Times (London)|The Times]]|location=London|date=February 6, 2004|accessdate=January 17, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612092211/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article1012828.ece|archivedate=June 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fcc complaints and fines 2001-2004.JPG|thumb|500px|right|The halftime show led to a great spike in FCC-issued fines and received complaints compared to those from previous years.]]
The incident triggered a rash of fines that the FCC levied soon after the Super Bowl, alleging that the context of the "wardrobe malfunction" was intended "to pander, titillate and shock those watching" because it happened within the lyrics within Timberlake's performance of ''Rock Your Body'': "Hurry up 'cause you're taking too long&amp;nbsp;... better have you naked by the end of this song."&lt;ref name="fccreport"&gt;{{cite journal|title=COMPLAINTS AGAINST VARIOUS TELEVISION LICENSEES CONCERNING THEIR FEBRUARY 1, 2004, BROADCAST OF THE SUPER BOWL XXXVIII HALFTIME SHOW|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-04-209A1.pdf|author=[[Michael Powell (attorney)|Michael Powell]], [[Michael Copps]], [[Kevin Martin (FCC)|Kevin Martin]], [[Jonathan Adelstein]]|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=September 22, 2004|accessdate=August 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the FCC cited a news article on MTV's website ([[MTV.com]]) claiming that the halftime show would promise "shocking moments"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Janet Jackson's Super Bowl Show Promises 'Shocking Moments'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484644/20040128/jackson_janet.jhtml|author=Shaheem Reid|publisher=MTV News|date=January 28, 2004|accessdate=August 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "officials of both CBS and MTV were well aware of the overall sexual nature of the Jackson/Timberlake segment, and fully sanctioned it – indeed, touted it as 'shocking' to attract potential viewers".&lt;ref name="fccreport"/&gt; CBS, however, argued that the exposure was unplanned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS to FCC: Halftime Show Finale Was a Surprise to Us, Too|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35448-2004Nov8.html|author=Lisa de Moraes|newspaper=The Washington Post|page=C7|date=November 9, 2004|accessdate=August 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in later statements CBS asserted that while the exposure was unplanned by CBS, it was deliberately planned by Timberlake and Jackson "independently and clandestinely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS warns of censorship if bare breast edict stays|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN1142486520070911|author=Jon Hurdle|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=September 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, 2004, the FCC fined Viacom the maximum penalty of US$27,500 for each of the 20 CBS-owned television stations (including [[broadcast relay station#satellite stations|satellites]] of [[WFRV]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[WCCO-TV|WCCO]] in [[Minneapolis]] and [[KUTV]] in [[Salt Lake City]]; current CBS owned-and-operated station [[KOVR]] in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] at the time was owned by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]) for a fine totaling US$550,000, the largest ever placed against a television broadcaster at that time.&lt;ref name="CBS FCC Fines"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=FCC proposes statutory maximum fine of $550,000 against Viacom-owned CBS affiliates for apparent violation of indecency rules during broadcast of Super Bowl halftime show|url=http://www.fcc.gov/eb/News_Releases/DOC-252384A1.html|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=September 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Parents Television Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=FCC Falls Short in Fining CBS Affiliates for Indecent Super Bowl Show|url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/release/2004/0922.asp|publisher=Parents Television Council|date=September 22, 2004|accessdate=July 27, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040923163142/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/release/2004/0922.asp|archivedate=September 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even some of the FCC commissioners&lt;ref name="fccreport"/&gt; criticized the Commission for fining only 20 CBS stations, not all of them, for the halftime show. 66% of respondents to a March 2005 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine poll believed that the FCC overreacted to the halftime show by fining CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Decency Police|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1039700,00.html|author=[[James Poniewozik]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 20, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814053856/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1039700%2C00.html|archivedate=August 14, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other controversies==

===Commercials===
Prior to the broadcast, CBS rejected the MoveOn.org [[Super Bowl advertising|Super Bowl ad]] ''[[Bush in 30 Seconds]]'' because it was deemed too controversial. CBS stated that it had a "decades-old" policy of rejecting advertisements regarding "controversial issues of public importance", although MoveOn charged that the networks had previously accepted similar advertisements from other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Censored at the Super Bowl|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2004/01/29/censored-at-the-super-bowl.html|author=Jonathan Darman|work=[[Newsweek]]|via=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=January 30, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040309180112/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4114703|archivedate=March 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Super Bowl broadcast featured numerous commercials for [[erectile dysfunction]] medicines and advertisements for [[Anheuser-Busch]]'s [[Bud Light]] brand featuring a [[flatulence|flatulating]] horse and a dog attacking male [[genitalia]]; however, no politically charged advertisements appeared during the telecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monkey business|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/football/nfl/specials/playoffs/2003/02/02/commercials/index.html|author=Dan George|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=February 2, 2004|accessdate=July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS, which also held the rights to [[Super Bowl XLIV]], later aired a commercial during that game featuring then-[[Florida Gators football|Florida Gators]] quarterback [[Tim Tebow]] and his mother that discreetly refer to their [[pro-life]] viewpoints. The ad, sponsored by [[Focus on the Family]], received similar controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[Gloria Allred]] (Women's Equal Rights Legal Defense and Education Fund) to [[Leslie Moonves]] (CBS), "[http://www.radaronline.com/sites/default/files/cbs1.pdf Super Bowl Sunday Ad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403042324/http://www.radaronline.com/sites/default/files/cbs1.pdf |date=2012-04-03 }}", January 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nothing wrong with Tebow Super Bowl ad|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/02/06/martin.tebow.superbowl.ad/|author=[[Roland S.

In January 2005, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], the network that carried Super Bowl XXXIX under the NFL's alternating network contract for the championship game, rejected an advertisement for the cold remedy [[Airborne (dietary supplement)|Airborne]] that briefly featured the naked buttocks of veteran actor [[Mickey Rooney]].&lt;ref name="year of living indecently"/&gt;

===Streaking===
Moments after the Jackson-Timberlake tangle, [[Streaking|streaker]] [[Mark Roberts (streaker)|Mark Roberts]] added to the controversial halftime by running around the field naked except for some writing on his body which read "SUPER BOWEL" on the front, an advertisement for an [[online betting]] website, and a well-placed [[G-string]] attached to half of a miniature football covering Roberts' genitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Image|url=http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/08_01/RobertsBase070807_468x749.jpg|work=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Roberts' stunt was broadcast in the United States; CBS chose to keep its cameras in a wide-shot view of the stadium and use quick cutaways to players and coaches as Roberts ran around the field until players from both competing teams, the [[New England Patriots]] and the [[Carolina Panthers]], tackled him. [[Matt Chatham]], the Patriots' special teams expert and reserve [[linebacker]] initially knocked Roberts down, thus allowing stadium security and police to arrest Roberts and take him into custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Linebacker levels Super Bowl streaker|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2004/02/02/pro_403164.shtml|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=[[Augusta Chronicle]]|date=February 1, 2004|accessdate=July 27, 2007}} Also published by SI.com as "[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/football/nfl/specials/playoffs/2003/02/01/bc.fbn.superbowl.streak.ap/index.html Pats' linebacker levels Super Bowl streaker]."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other performers===
Aside from Jackson's exposure, minor controversy around the show's other performances included rappers [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]] and [[Nelly]] gesturing towards their crotches{{cn|date=February 2018}}, stripping [[cheerleaders]]{{cn|date=February 2018}}, and musician [[Kid Rock]] appearing in a poncho made from a slit [[Flag of the United States|American flag]], which he later threw towards the audience.&lt;ref name="jacksonresponsible"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VFW slams Kid Rock for flag poncho|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/02/04/Artsandentartainment/VFW_slams_Kid_Rock_fo.shtml|author=Justin George|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=February 4, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Senator Zell Miller complained that Kid Rock's outfit was a desecration of the American flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=|url=http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail-pf.php?n=176732|publisher=AccessNorthGA.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232437/http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail-pf.php?n=176732|archivedate=2014-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and effects==

===Censorship and regulation of broadcasting===
Website Soap Opera Central speculated that the fallout from this incident may have had a subtle effect on [[daytime television]]. These television shows are known for "[[Love in the Afternoon (advertising campaign)|love in the afternoon]]" and regularly feature romantic couplings; shortly before the Super Bowl, the [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] [[soap opera]]s ''[[As the World Turns]]'' and ''[[Guiding Light]]'' had gone as far as featuring rear male nudity during sexual scenes. After the Super Bowl controversy, FCC commissioner [[Michael J. Copps]] stated that it was time for a crackdown on inappropriate sexual content in daytime television, and indicated that he was reviewing whether soap operas were violating the agency's indecency prohibitions.&lt;ref name="cleanupsoaps"&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC says soaps may need to be cleaned up|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/soapcentral/news/2004/0412-fcc.php|author=Dan J. Kroll|work=[[Soapcentral]]|date=April 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other major sporting events that followed the Super Bowl that year also were forced to censor their respective halftime shows following the incident. The [[Pro Bowl]], which would be played on February 8 at [[Aloha Stadium]] in Hawaii, originally was to feature singer [[JC Chasez]], who was a member of boy band 'N Sync as was Timberlake, sing the [[Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]] before the game and perform his hit song "[[Blowin' Me Up (with Her Love)]]" at [[halftime]]. However, the NFL did not allow Chasez to perform during halftime due to the sexually suggestive content of his chosen song (even though the game was carried by ESPN, which is not under the content purview of the FCC as it is a cable network, and therefore only self-regulates content as an advertiser-supported service), replacing it with traditional Hawai{{okina}}ian dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justin 'Appalled' By Super Bowl Incident; NFL Nixes JC Appearance|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484824/justin-appalled-by-super-bowl-incident.jhtml|author=Corey Moss|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=August 24, 2013|date=February 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JC Chasez Slams NFL After Being Cut From Pro Bowl Halftime|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484842/jc-slams-nfl-after-being-cut-from-pro-bowl.jhtml|author=Corey Moss|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=August 24, 2013|date=February 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2004 NBA All-Star Game]] also censored its act, despite being broadcast on [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] (which in reiteration, is not bound by FCC content regulations as a cable network), having halftime performer [[Beyoncé|Beyoncé Knowles]] perform "[[Crazy in Love (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Crazy in Love]]" rather than "[[Naughty Girl (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Naughty Girl]]", which they feared would incite controversy given its sexual content. Jackson was in attendance at the game, and dressed conservatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Lane|2006|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The networks that were to broadcast the [[46th Grammy Awards]] (CBS) and the [[76th Academy Awards]] (ABC), live events scheduled for February 8 and February 29 respectively, enhanced their broadcast delays to accommodate editing of inappropriate video in addition to audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS to use 'enhanced' tape-delay for Grammys|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/02/03/grammys.tape.delay|publisher=CNN|date=February 4, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407194339/http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/02/03/grammys.tape.delay/|archivedate=April 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC to impose delay on Oscar telecast|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/02/05/sprj.aa04.abc.oscar.delay/|author=Matt Carey|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 23, 2013|date=February 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following these announcements, ''Guiding Light'' edited out nudity from an episode that had already been taped. A week later, the show's [[executive producer]] [[John Conboy]] was fired and replaced by [[Ellen Wheeler]]. All nine American network soaps began to impose an unwritten rule of avoiding any sort of risqué adult scenes, and in the months following, editors of soap opera periodical ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' wrote about how daytime television was losing its steam.&lt;ref name="cleanupsoaps"/&gt; [[NBC]] also re-edited a scene from an episode of its medical drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' where paramedics were wheeling an elderly woman into the hospital, and her breast could be seen non-explicitly in the context of her injury and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC's 'ER' Cuts Shot of Patient's Breast|url=http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/T/TV_ER_BREAST?SITE=FLTAM&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|author=Lynn Elber|work=Associated Press|date=February 4, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040223195103/http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/T/TV_ER_BREAST?SITE=FLTAM&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|archivedate=February 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even as late as [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]] (November 11) of 2004, 65 ABC-affiliated stations pre-empted the uncut network presentation of the film ''Saving Private Ryan'' over concerns about the film's violent and profane content and FCC regulations. Benjamin Svetkey of ''Entertainment Weekly'' quoted L. Brent Bozell III and [[Peggy Noonan]] associating the mass pre-emption of ''Ryan'' with the halftime show incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=America is from Mars, Hollywood is from Venus|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,784915,00.html|author=Benjamin Svetkey|periodical=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 24, 2004|issue=794|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual [[Victoria's Secret Fashion Show]] was cancelled for that year in reaction to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Victoria's Secret is out|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/04/12/news/fortune500/victorias_secret/index.htm|author=Joseph Lee|publisher=CNN|date=April 12, 2004|accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A petition was filed by a consortium of broadcasters (which included Viacom) and the RIAA over an FCC indecency ruling, regarding [[fleeting expletives]] uttered by [[Bono]] of [[U2]] when accepting an award at the [[60th Golden Globe Awards]] in 2003. It argued that the FCC had implemented a standard "that would allow it to censor all kinds of things — anything considered blasphemous, coarse or vulgar", and observed that many radio stations, especially [[rock music|rock]]-formatted stations, had been engaging in self-censorship by censoring or removing songs from their libraries, so that they would not run afoul of the stricter regulation.&lt;ref name=rock&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Fights for Free Speech|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/media-fights-for-free-speech-20040511|author=Damien Cave|work=Rolling Stone|date=November 5, 2004|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clear Channel Communications]] removed talk-radio host [[Howard Stern]] from several of its large-market radio stations within a month of the incident, citing the raunchy content of Stern's show. The FCC fined Clear Channel over allegedly indecent content on the [[Bubba the Love Sponge]] radio show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clear Channel to pay record fine for indecency charges|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/clearchannelfine_06-09-04.html|work=The Newshour with Jim Lehrer|publisher=PBS|date=June 9, 2004|accessdate=July 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the incident, some networks established regulations requiring time delays of as much as five minutes for live broadcasts such as [[awards show]]s and sporting events.&lt;ref name="BBC Oscars Angry over Delay"&gt;{{cite news|title=Oscar head angry at TV show delay|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3478467.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=February 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2004, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a bill to raise the maximum FCC fine penalty from said US$27,500 to US$500,000 per violation; the [[United States Senate]] voted to decrease it to US$275,000 per incident, with a cap of US$3 million per day.&lt;ref name="CBS FCC Fines"&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS Fined $550,000 for Jackson Stunt |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/F/FCC_CBS?SITE=FLSTU&amp;SECTION=ENTERTAINMENT |author=Jennifer C.

The incident also prompted tighter control over content by station owners and managers. Viacom, at the center of the controversy, also employed the controversial Howard Stern in its radio division (at the time called [[Infinity Broadcasting]]). The expanding control on content is said to be a contributing factor that drove Stern away from [[terrestrial radio]] and onto [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], and is sometimes credited as the media figure most responsible for introducing a new era in radio.&lt;ref name=cogin/&gt; It has also been reported that some teen-oriented awards shows in the summer of 2004 had also been purged of most sexual and profane content that had been perceived as staples in such awards telecasts in the past, including Fox's [[Teen Choice Awards]] and MTV's self-created Video Music Awards.&lt;ref name="toned down"/&gt; Author Frederick S. Lane stated in an interview with John Eggerton of ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]'' magazine that the controversy surrounding the halftime show was the primary inspiration for his 2006 book ''The Decency Wars: The Campaign to Cleanse American Culture'', which explains moral controversies in the American media over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Behind the Cultural Clean-Up|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/6368245-Behind_the_Cutural_Clean-Up.php|author=John Eggerton|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=September 4, 2006|accessdate=April 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Super Bowl itself would not feature a modern act for its halftime show for the next six years, opting instead for classic rockers such as [[Paul McCartney]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]], and The Who (McCartney, the Stones and The Who were all part of the [[British Invasion]] of the 1960s). In fact, no women performed at the Super Bowl halftime show at all until [[The Black Eyed Peas]] performed in 2011.

In 2012, during the halftime show for [[Super Bowl XLVI]], rapper [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]] [[Finger (gesture)|pointed up her middle finger]] during her performance. That incident drew comparisons with the exposure of Janet Jackson's breast in the Super Bowl halftime show eight years prior. The Associated Press asserted that people learned what M.I.A. did only when reports surfaced in the media and quoted TV critic [[James Poniewozik]]: "I had no idea she even did it until NBC issued an apology for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Censors MIA on M.I.A.'s finger flip|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SUPER_BOWL_MUSIC?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|author=David Bauder|work=Associated Press|date=February 6, 2012|accessdate=February 8, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207183138/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SUPER_BOWL_MUSIC?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|archivedate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC blurred the entire screen albeit a second too late to obscure M.I.A. giving the finger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M.I.A.'s Middle Finger Could Be Expensive for NBC|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/business/2012/02/mis-middle-finger-could-be-expensive-nbc/48337/|author=John Hudson|work=[[The Atlantic Wire]]|date=February 6, 2012|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL ultimately sued M.I.A. for US$1.5 million on [[breach of contract]] grounds.&lt;ref name=cogin/&gt; The lawsuit was settled in August 2014 and the terms of the settlement remained private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=NFL settles lawsuit with singer M.I.A. over Super Bowl middle finger |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=22 August 2014 |url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2014/08/22/nfl-settles-lawsuit-mia-middle-finger |accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an indication of the reduced level of complaints, only 222 complaints were filed over the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M.I.A. vs. NFL in mysterious middle finger lawsuit|url=http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/9720980/espnw-sarah-spain-mia-nfl-mysterious-middle-finger-lawsuit|author=Sarah Spain|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three weeks later, [[NASCAR]] announced at the driver and crew chief meeting at [[Rockingham Speedway|North Carolina Speedway]] that it would stiffen penalties on use of improper language or gestures including larger fines, loss of points (if it occurred in a post-race interview or after the driver fell out of a race), ejection of a team from the race, or lap penalties (if in-race) under the circuit's "detrimental to NASCAR" rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drivers warned about objectionable language|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/2004-03-15-swearing_x.htm|author=Christ Jenkins|newspaper=USA Today|date=March 16, 2004|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johnny Sauter]] was fined US$10,000 and 25 points a week after the new rule took in effect for obscene language in an interview. Later in 2004, [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] received a 25-point penalty and a US$50,000 fine when he used an obscenity after winning the 2004 [[EA Sports 500]] at [[Talladega Superspeedway]]. He lost the championship lead after that incident and lost the championship by 100 points after the incident. In 2007, [[Tony Stewart]] received a similar penalty after using an obscenity in a post-race interview following his [[Brickyard 400]] win. [[Kyle Busch]], in November 2010, was fined US$25,000 for an obscene gesture caught on ESPN, along with an in-race two-lap penalty, as the gesture was aimed at a NASCAR official.

The NFL also came under some smaller controversies over its telecasts. The FCC received a complaint about Fox's telecast of a January 2005 playoff game between the [[Green Bay Packers]] and [[Minnesota Vikings]]; the complainant alleged that Minnesota player [[Randy Moss]], who scored a touchdown, apparently made movements appearing to [[mooning|moon]] the spectators. However, the FCC denied the complaint because Moss was fully clothed at all times, and his gestures were shown for only a few seconds, thus warranting that the display was not indecent; game announcer [[Joe Buck]] also immediately condemned the act (and additionally, Moss was fined by the NFL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC sheds moonlight|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=408451|author=Bob Wolfley|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]]|date=March 15, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527001423/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=408451|archivedate=May 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 13, 2007, during Fox's coverage of an NFL playoff game between the [[New Orleans Saints]] and [[Philadelphia Eagles]], the camera cut to the stands, showing for four seconds a shirt with the words "[[Fuck]] DA EAGLES" that was worn by a female spectator.

===Impact on Timberlake===
Immediately following the incident Timberlake jokingly dismissed it, telling the inquisitive press: "[Jackson and I] love giving you all something to talk about."&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; His attitude quickly changed as the scandal grew into a serious controversy. ''People Magazine'' stated Timberlake was referred to as "the [[Teflon]] man" at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards because the incident did not affect him as it did with Jackson.&lt;ref name=lena/&gt; In a 2006 interview with MTV, Timberlake said that compared to the huge backlash Jackson suffered, he himself received only about 10% of the blame; and he accused American society of being both "harsher on women" and "unfairly harsh on ethnic people".&lt;ref name=moss/&gt; Prior to plans for the Super Bowl performance, Jackson and Timberlake had discussed potentially recording a duet for Jackson's ''Damita Jo'' album, as well as a rumored collaboration for a [[Quincy Jones]] album, though neither came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jackson's Action|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,345296,00.html|author=Brian Hiatt|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=August 22, 2002|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Janet and Justin: Together Again|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/03/29/janet-and-justin-together-again/|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=March 29, 2004|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, Timberlake performed a cover of Jackson's "[[Let's Wait Awhile]]" on ''[[The 20/20 Experience World Tour]]'' before transitioning into his song "[[Until the End of Time (Justin Timberlake and Beyoncé Knowles song)|Until the End of Time]]", which was regarded as a sign of affection or apology to Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justin Timberlake Ready Apologize Janet Jackson|url=http://uptownmagazine.com/2013/11/justin-timberlake-ready-apologize-janet-jackson/|author=M.

Media commentators stated Jackson was treated too harshly by the media and public, while Timberlake's career was not affected much by the incident. Shannon L. Holland in ''[[Women's Studies in Communication]]'' argued that the media reaction after the incident focused disproportionately on Jackson, "represent[ing] her as a contemporary [[Jezebel]] in that her racial and gendered Otherness was often juxtaposed with the 'normalcy' of Timberlake's white masculinity. That is, she emerged in a public discourse as the primary (if not sole) instigator of the lewd act, a scheming seductress who manipulated Timberlake for her own economic gain."&lt;ref name="Women's Studies"&gt;{{cite book|title=The "Offending" Breast of Janet Jackson: Public Discourse Surrounding the Jackson/Timberlake Performance at Super Bowl XXXVIII|author=Shannon L.

After a while, there was only Janet Jackson. That's all there was. Janet Jackson," adding "Janet don't pull that thing open herself. He did it.

Several songs have mentioned Jackson's performance, most notably [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] in [[Birdman (entertainer)|Birdman]]'s "[[Money to Blow]]" and [[Eminem]]'s "[[Ass Like That]]", as well as [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]]'s "Zone", [[Tyga]]'s "Tyga Montana", [[50 Cent]]'s "Just a Touch", [[Kanye West]] in [[Mase]]'s "[[Welcome Back (Mase song)|Be Alright (Welcome Back Remix)]]", [[Tech N9ne]]'s "[[All 6's and 7's|Pornographic]]" and "Flash", [[T-Pain]]'s "[[Three Ringz|Therapy]]", [[Chamillionaire]]'s "Talking That Talk", and [[Common (rapper)|Common]] in [[Jadakiss]]'s "[[Why (Jadakiss song)|Why?

Justin Timberlake referenced the incident when ripping off part of Kristen Wiig's outfit during an appearance on ''Saturday Night Live'' in 2009.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Bowl XXXVIII (TV Movie 2004) - Connections|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399708/movieconnections|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Family Guy'' episode "[[PTV (Family Guy)|PTV]]" was written as a parody of the FCC's strict measures and regulations following Jackson's Super Bowl halftime show performance controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William S.

The episode received [[Primetime Emmy Award]] and [[Annie Award]] nominations for its subject matter. Jackson's performance also inspired the ''South Park'' episode "Good Times with Weapons". In the episode, [[Trey Parker|the show's]] [[Matt Stone|creators]] draw attention to the media and public's unnecessary reaction to Jackson's brief exposure while disregarding or accepting extreme acts of violence during a scene where the public is outraged when Eric Cartman is seen naked and having a "wardrobe malfunction" on stage, while character Butters Stotch is ignored although he is bleeding and severely injured. Several [[game show]]s have also mentioned Jackson's performance.

Several presenters at award shows have referenced the incident, including [[Anna Nicole Smith]] at the first annual [[MTV Australia Video Music Awards 2005|MTV Australia Video Music Awards]], Dave Chappelle at the MTV Video Music Awards, and singer [[Alanis Morissette]] at the [[Juno Awards]], commenting, "It's disturbing and curious to me to see what came of that. We're all sexual beings, and if we don't let it out organically, we repress ourselves. If we repress anger, it turns to depression. If we repress our sexuality, it turns to [[pornography]] and [[rape]]. To think that the country was in an uproar because of a nipple."&lt;ref name="toned down"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Morrissette finds peace and love|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=20040601&amp;id=YkAhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qXsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4735,293594|author=Joan Anderman|newspaper=[[New Straits Times]]|via=Google News|date=January 20, 2004|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[Russell Brand]] referenced the incident when hosting the [[2008 MTV Video Music Awards]], saying "I can almost guarantee a Janet Jackson-style Super Bowl nip slip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Brand's MTV Bedtime for Jonas Brothers|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/20385/russell-brand-s-mtv-bedtime-for-jonas-brothers|publisher=E!|date=July 24, 2008|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Super Bowl XXXVIII incident is considered to be the most controversial television and media event to occur within [[popular culture]], and Jackson was regarded as the world's "most controversial musician" who was "changing the cultural landscape" due to the incident's massive effect on censorship and [[broadcasting]] in television and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jackson Turns 38|url=http://www.castanet.net/news/Entertainment/1498/Jackson-Turns-38|publisher=Castanet.net|date=May 16, 2004|accessdate=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance incident made "Janet Jackson" the most searched term, event and image in Internet history.&lt;ref name="Search Engine Journal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt; Jackson was later listed in the 2007 edition of ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as "Most Searched in Internet History" and the "Most Searched for News Item".&lt;ref name="CBC News"/&gt; It also broke the record for "most searched event over one day".&lt;ref name="Ted Mandell"/&gt; 'Janet Jackson' also became the most searched term and person for 2004 and also of the following year.&lt;ref name="Lycos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; It also set a record for being the most watched, recorded and replayed moment on [[TiVo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Super Bowl: The most DVR’d, and DVR-proof, broadcast on TV|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/cutline/super-bowl-most-dvr-d-dvr-proof-broadcast-200015178.html|publisher=Yahoo!

The audience reaction charts looked like an [[electrocardiogram]]."&lt;ref name="CNET"/&gt; Monte Burke of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine reported, "[t]he fleeting moment enticed an estimated 35,000 new [TiVo] subscribers to sign up."&lt;ref name="ripple effect"/&gt; Janet's Super Bowl halftime incident also coined the phrase "wardrobe malfunction", which was later officially added to the Webster's English Dictionary in 2008.&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt; In the immediate aftermath of the incident, ''Entertainment Weekly'' stated "Radio stations rushed to add Jackson's new single, "Just a Little While" to playlists on Monday following the incident [...] And ''USA Today'' reports that jewelry stores and piercing studios are seeing increased customer interest in silver sunburst-shaped nipple shields."&lt;ref name=ew/&gt;

[[YouTube]] co-founder [[Jawed Karim]] revealed that his frustration at not being able to easily find a video clip of the incident provided the inspiration for the creation of YouTube, and later of [[Vevo]].&lt;ref name="Who Invented YouTube"/&gt; The launch of [[Facebook]] commenced three days following the incident, in a potential attempt to capitalize on its publicity through social networking.&lt;ref name=cogin/&gt;

''Rolling Stone'' stated Jackson's Super Bowl performance "is far and away the most famous moment in the history of the Super Bowl halftime show".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Readers' Poll: The Greatest Super Bowl Halftime Shows|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-greatest-super-bowl-halftime-shows-20130130/9-janet-jackson-0629268|work=Rolling Stone|date=January 30, 2013|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''PopCrush'' called the performance "one of the most shocking moments in pop culture" as well as a "totally unexpected and unforgettable moment".&lt;ref name=popcrush&gt;{{cite web|title=Janet Jackson – Celebrity Wardrobe Malfunctions|url=http://popcrush.com/janet-jackson-wardrobe-malfunction/|author=Cristin Maher|work=PopCrush|date=May 15, 2013|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Gawker]]'' ranked the performance among the most recent of the "10 Shows that Advanced Sex on Television", commenting the set "had all the elements of a huge story" and "within seconds the world searched furtively for pictures", concluding "it remains so ubiquitous, it's impossible to look at a starburst nipple shield without thinking "Janet Jackson"".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Shows that Advanced Sex on Television |url=http://gawker.com/483728002 |author=Scott Green |work=Gawker |date=May 18, 2010 |accessdate=April 1, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201221549/http://gawker.com/483728002 |archivedate=February 1, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''E!

{{use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}

'''''Tanzim''''' ({{lang-ar|تنظيم}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Tanẓīm}}'', "Organization") is a militant faction of the Palestinian [[Fatah]] movement.

==Overview==
The Tanzim militia, founded in 1995 by [[Yasser Arafat]] and other [[Fatah]] leaders to counter Palestinian [[Islamism]],&lt;ref name=agateway&gt;{{cite web|title=Palestinian Organizations|url=http://www.al-bab.com/arab/countries/palestine/orgs4.htm#Tanzim|publisher=Arab Gateway|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is widely considered to be an armed offshoot of Fatah with its own leadership structure. The acknowledged head of the Tanzim is [[Marwan Barghouti]], who is as of 2017, serving five consecutive life sentences in Israel for murder, and, according to some accounts, has a substantial following among the [[Arab rejectionism|rejectionist camp]] which opposes the Interim Agreement (also called Oslo II or Taba) signed on 28 September 1995 with Israel.&lt;ref name="crsfac"&gt;{{CRS| article=Palestinian Factions |url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS21235.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tanzim is a grass roots organization that operates at the community level. By taking a hardline position against Israel, it has helped siphon Palestinian support from the Islamist groups to the [[Palestinian Authority]] and [[PLO]] leadership.&lt;ref name="crsfac"/&gt;

Tanzim came to prominence in the street fighting which marked the beginning of the [[Second Intifada|second Palestinian Intifada]]. Its members tend to be younger than those of other Fatah factions, often having grown up in the post-Oslo era. Many Tanzim members have joined the [[al-Shaid Yasser Arafat Brigades]] (formerly the ''al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades''). Tanzim has also recruited female [[suicide bomber]]s, including [[Andaleeb Takatka]], a 20-year-old [[Bethlehem]] woman who detonated an explosive belt at a [[Jerusalem]] bus stop in April 2002, killing six Israeli civilians, and injuring sixty.&lt;ref&gt;Citation needed&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marwan Barghouti]], widely described as heading Tanzim, explicitly condemned terror attacks within Israel, writing "While I, and the Fatah movement to which I belong, strongly oppose attacks and the targeting of civilians inside Israel, our future neighbor, I reserve the right to protect myself, to resist the Israeli occupation of my country and to fight for my freedom."&lt;ref&gt;http://electronicintifada.net/content/want-security-end-occupation/4796&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 2015 the Israeli army arrested [[Jamal Abu Lel]], charging that he was "the head of" the Tanzim "terrorist organization," running it from the [[Kalandia|Qalandiya]] refugee camp while carrying an Israeli permanent resident identity card&lt;ref name=TOI20160215&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel arrests head of Fatah-aligned terror group|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-arrests-head-of-fatah-aligned-terror-group/|accessdate=15 February 2016|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|publisher=The Times of Israel Ltd.|date=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to his residing in Kfar Aqab, on the other side of the [[Atarot Airport|Jerusalem Airport]] from Qalandiya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Judah|title=Israel arrests head of Fatah armed wing|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israel-arrests-head-of-fatah-armed-wing/|accessdate=15 February 2016|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|publisher=The Times of Israel Ltd.|date=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Lel is accused by the [[Shin Bet]] of funding and directing terrorist and shooting attacks against Israelis.&lt;ref name=TOI20160215 /&gt;

''The Blood Confession'' received a positive review from [[Strange Horizons]], stating that while "first half of the book does wander... it is in its modern connotations that Libby's book really soars and disturbs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2007/03/the_blood_confe.shtml The Blood Confession by Alisa Libby] Strange Horizons&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kirkus Reviews]] praised "Libby’s combination of history, fairy tales and the Bible" but stated that it was "a conceptually interesting but sluggishly paced gothic horror".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/alisa-m-libby/the-blood-confession/ THE BLOOD CONFESSION By Alisa M. Libby] Kirkus Reviews&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books wrote that the book was "not for the faint of heart" and that "this first person narrative doesn’t leave out any of the gory details."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bccb.lis.illinois.edu/2010/February2010/0210doz.pdf Karen Coates, Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, 60, no. 3 (2006): 133]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[School Library Journal]] praised the book's characterizations while stating that the book's "depiction of Erzebet's descent into madness is overly lengthy".&lt;ref&gt;Capozzella, Michele. ''School Library Journal'' November, 2006, p.140&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tree Day''' has been started in the Indian city of [[Hyderabad]] on 15 May 2016 to protest against the government's plans to cut thousands of trees around the [[Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park|KBR National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Road-project-to-uproot-3100-trees-in-Hyderabad/articleshow/51886997.cms|title=Road project to uproot 3,100 trees in Hyderabad|date=19 April 2016|work=The Times of India|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of Telangana has proposed a Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP) under which the entire KBR Park periphery also called the KBR Park [[Eco-Sensitive Zone]] will be affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/breather-for-kbr-park-trees/article8559228.ece|title=Breather for KBR Park trees|author=Rahul Devulapalli|work=The Hindu|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://v6news.tv/save-tree-save-kbr-protest-against-tree-felling-at-kbr-park|title=Save Tree - Save KBR  - Protest Against Tree Felling at KBR Park - V6 News Channel Live|work=v6news.tv|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will lead to a significant impact on the flora and fauna of the park that houses more than 600 species of plants, hundreds of species of animals and birds.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Tree Day was organized by a group called "Hyderabad Rising", a group of non-partisan, non-political nature lovers who came together for a small protest rally in the last week of April.

Tree Day, a term inspired by Mothers Day, Teachers Day and Father's day was coined by Hyderabad Rising.

[[File:Post Waffle Crisp.jpg|thumb|right|Waffle Crisp]]
'''Waffle Crisp''' was a [[breakfast cereal]] made by [[Post Foods]], which contained [[maple syrup]]-flavored corn cereal bits in a waffle shape. It was first launched in 1996. In 2013, Post introduced a lower-priced version of the cereal, "Waffle Crunch," as part of their Good MOREnings line of budget cereals. According to customer service at Post Foods, Waffle Crisp was discontinued in August of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Post Cereal Discontinued Products|url=https://www.postconsumerbrands.com/discontinued-products/|website=Post Cereal|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mascots==
The original Waffle Crisp mascots were a group of elderly women, dubbed "grannies", who purportedly cooked each individual piece as if it were an actual, miniature-sized waffle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waffle Crisp Ad - 1996|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqkQsq23DwA|website=YouTube|publisher=ProjectAdHand|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the commercials for Waffle Crisp from the late 1990s featured preteen kids attempting to break into the (surprisingly high-tech) factory to steal the cereal's [[secret recipe (disambiguation)|secret recipe]] or, at the very least, get a large quantity of Waffle Crisp for themselves (in other words, steal one box of this cereal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waffle Crisp Ad- Infiltration (1996)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW5WTQ9Tc7s|website=YouTube|publisher=that90sguy|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next mascot was an anthropomorphic waffle with red [[tennis shoes]] dubbed "Waffle Boy". He defends the cereal against a cartoon villain known as Professor Burnt Toast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Post Waffle Crisp|url=http://www.mrbreakfast.com/cereal_detail.asp?id=388|website=Mr. Breakfast|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waffle Crisp appeared in an episode of the television sitcom, "Friends", where the main character, Joey, is seen reading a box while sitting in his lazy boy.

==Video games==
Postopia.com, Post's official website for children, created a Waffle Boy-themed [[video game]] called ''Waffle Boy's Extreme Bike Mountain Adventure''. It takes place in the jungle where Professor Burnt Toast has stolen the Precious Waffle Crisp, and Waffle Boy goes to retrieve it. A sequel game was made, entitled ''Waffle Boy's Jungle Adventure''. In this game, Professor Burnt Toast has created a machine that will destroy it all.

However, Waffle Boy was later replaced in the video game series by a dinosaur named "Bronk", and its plot involves him protecting the secret existence of a fictional race of [[dinosaur]]s dubbed as "platosaurs".

"'''Walk on the Wild Side'''" is a song by [[Lou Reed]] from his second solo album, ''[[Transformer (album)|Transformer]]'' (1972). It was produced by [[David Bowie]] and [[Mick Ronson]], and released as a double A-side with "[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]". The song received wide radio coverage, despite its touching on taboo topics such as [[transsexual]] people, [[recreational drugs|drugs]], [[male prostitution]], and [[oral sex]]. In the United States, [[RCA]] released the single using an edited version of the song without the reference to oral sex. In 2010, [[Rolling Stone]] ranked it at number 223 in its list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 greatest songs of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/lou-reed-walk-on-the-wild-side-20110527&lt;/ref&gt;

The lyrics, describing a series of individuals and their journeys to [[New York City]], refer to several of the regular "[[Warhol superstars|superstars]]" at [[Andy Warhol|Andy Warhol's]] New York studio, [[the Factory]], namely [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Candy Darling]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[Jackie Curtis]] and Joe Campbell (referred to in the song by his nickname ''Sugar Plum Fairy''). Candy Darling was also the subject of Reed's earlier song for [[The Velvet Underground]], "Candy Says".

Two decades after the song's release, Reed told interviewer [[David Fricke]], "I know my obituary has already been written.  And it starts out, "Doot, di-doot, di-doot...""&lt;ref&gt;Fricke, David, Mojo Magazine, November 2016, pg. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musicians==
The baritone [[saxophone]] solo played over the fadeout of the song is performed by [[Ronnie Ross]], who had taught David Bowie to play the saxophone during Bowie's childhood.&lt;ref name="simpson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/oct/21/little-known-musicians-famous-moments-baker-street|title=The little-known musicians behind some of music's most famous moments|author=Dave Simpson|website=The Guardian|date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The backing vocals are sung by [[Thunderthighs]], a vocal group that included Dari Lalou, Karen Friedman, and Casey Synge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barton|first1=Laura|title=Hail, Hail, Rock'n'Roll|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/12/why-i-love-backing-singers|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thunderthighs|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/thunderthighs-mn0000764406/credits|website=Allmusic|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upright bass and bass guitar are both played by [[Herbie Flowers]] who was paid a £17 flat fee ({{Inflation|UK|17|1972|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK}}).&lt;ref name="simpson" /&gt;

==Musical elements==
Like many of Reed's songs, "Walk on the Wild Side" is based on a [[plagal cadence]], alternating from [[C major|C to F]]. The F is played as a [[sixth chord]]. The pre-chorus introduces the [[major second]], D Major, although in some live performances this was changed to D minor, resulting in a completely [[diatonic]] song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigchords.com/lou_reed_chords/walk_on_the_wild_side_ver_3_chords.html |title=Lou Reed - Walk On The Wild Side (ver 3) Chords |publisher=Bigchords.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is also noted for its twin interlocking [[bass line]]s played by Herbie Flowers on [[double bass]] and overdubbed on a stacked knob 1960 [[fretless guitar|fretless]] [[Fender Jazz Bass]]. In an interview on [[BBC Radio 4]] (''Playing Second Fiddle'', aired July 2005), Flowers claimed that the reason he came up with the twin bass line was that as a session musician he would be paid double for playing two instruments on the same track, thus likely totalling his pay to £34 ({{Inflation|UK|34|1972|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK}}).

==Inspiration==
In the 2001 documentary ''Classic Albums: Lou Reed: Transformer'', Reed says that it was [[Nelson Algren]]'s 1956 novel, ''[[A Walk on the Wild Side]]'' (itself titled after the 1952 song "[[The Wild Side of Life]]"),&lt;ref name=Flanagan2005&gt;[[Richard Flanagan]], [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3649694/Prophet-of-the-neon-wilderness.html "Prophet of the neon wilderness"], ''{{w|The Sunday Telegraph}}'', January 29, 2006 (reprinted as "Introduction", dated "October 2005", in the novel's digital edition, Canongate Books, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-84767-649-8}}): ‘As [[Nelson Algren|Algren]] admitted, the book “wasn’t written until long after it had been walked… I found my way to the streets on the other side of the Southern Pacific station, where the big jukes were singing something called ‘Walking [[the Wild Side of Life]].’ I’ve stayed pretty much on that side of the curb ever since.”&amp;nbsp;’&lt;/ref&gt; that was the launching point for the song, even though, as it grew, the song became inhabited by characters from his own life. As with several other Reed songs from the 1970s, the title may also be an allusion to an earlier song, in this case [[Mack David]] and [[Elmer Bernstein]]'s [[Walk on the Wild Side (David and Bernstein song)|song of the same name]], the [[Academy Award]]-nominated title song of the [[Walk on the Wild Side (film)|1962 film]] based on Algren's novel.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} During his performance of the song on his 1978 ''[[Live: Take No Prisoners]]'' album, Reed humorously explains the song's development from a request that he write the music for the never-completed musical version of Algren's novel.

Each verse refers to one of the "[[Warhol superstars|superstars]]" at [[Andy Warhol|Andy Warhol's]] New York studio, [[The Factory]].&lt;ref name="reedbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reed|first1=Lou|title=Between Thought and Expression: Selected Lyrics of Lou Reed|date=1991|publisher=Hyperion|isbn=1-56282-923-8|page=42|quote=They were going to make a musical out of Nelson Algren's A Walk on the Wild Side. When they dropped the project I took my song and changed the book's characters into people I knew from Warhol's Factory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Holly" is based on [[Holly Woodlawn]], a [[transsexual]] actress who lived in [[Miami Beach, Florida]] as a child. In 1962, after being bullied by [[Homophobia|homophobes]], the fifteen-year-old ran away from home; and, as in the lyrics, learned how to pluck her eyebrows while hitchhiking to New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simpson|first1=Dave|title=Bet you think this song is about you|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/13/people-inspired-pop-songs-muses|accessdate=4 April 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Candy" is based on [[Candy Darling]], a transsexual actress and the subject of an earlier song by Lou Reed, "Candy Says". She grew up on [[Long Island]] ("the island") and was a regular at "the back room" of [[Max's Kansas City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moynihan|first1=Colin|title=From the Archives, a Portrait of a Pop-Art Muse|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/arts/design/25cand.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/899942329|title=Candy Darling : memoirs of an Andy Warhol superstar|last=1944-1974,|first=Darling, Candy,|date=2015|publisher=Open Road Integrated Media|isbn=9781480407756|location=New York|oclc=899942329}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Little Joe" was the nickname of [[Joe Dallesandro]], an actor who starred in ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'', a 1968 film about a teenage [[Male prostitute|hustler]]. Dallesandro said in 2014 that he had never met Reed when the song was written, and that the lyrics were based on the film character, not himself personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joe Dallesandro: The Warhol-Era Sex Symbol Talks|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/joe-dallesandro-the-warhol-era-sex-symbol-talks-4321463|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Sugar Plum Fairy" was a reference to actor [[Joe Campbell (actor)|Joe Campbell]], who played a character by that name in Warhol's 1965 film, ''My Hustler''. The term was a euphemism for "[[drug dealer]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klemm|first1=Michael D.|title=Warhol On The Beach|url=http://www.cinemaqueer.com/review%20pages%204/myhustler.html|website=CinemaQueer.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Jackie" is based on [[Jackie Curtis]], another Warhol actor. "Speeding" and "crashing" are drug references. Curtis at one time hoped to play the role of [[James Dean]] in a movie; Dean was killed in a car crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCourt|first1=James|title=Warhol's Brainy Goddess|url=http://gaycitynews.nyc/gcn_425/warholsbrainygoddes.html|website=Gay City News|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The lyrics were groundbreaking and risqué for their time, telling stories not usually told in rock songs up to then, and containing references to prostitution, transsexuals, and oral sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trebay|first1=Guy|title=The Real-Life Stories Told in ‘Walk on the Wild Side’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/fashion/The-Real-Life-Stories-Told-by-Lou-Reed-in-Walk-on-the-Wild-Side.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I always thought it would be kinda fun to introduce people to characters they maybe hadn't met before, or hadn't wanted to meet," Reed said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bockris|first1=Victor|authorlink=Victor Bockris|title=Transformer: The Lou Reed Story|date=1994|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=0-684-80366-6|page=207|quote=The impact of ''Transformer's'' sexual content has been forgotten. It is hard to conjure up the shock resulting from David Bowie's confession of bisexuality [in 1972].}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original release was a worldwide hit. In 2010, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked it as the 223rd greatest song of all time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/lou-reed-walk-on-the-wild-side-20110527&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, RCA released the single using an edited version of the song without the reference to oral sex. {{when?|date=December 2016}} In the UK, the reference has sometimes slipped past the censors, who were apparently unfamiliar with the term "giving head".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten things you never knew about Lou Reed|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/ten-things-you-never-knew-about-lou-reed|website=Clash|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{when?|date=December 2016}} The term "colored girls" was also an issue in the US; RCA provided radio stations with a version in which it was edited out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Santoso|first1=Alex|title=The Story Behind Lou Reed's "Walk on the Wild Side"|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2012/09/17/The-Story-Behind-Lou-Reeds-Walk-on-the-Wild-Side/|website=Neatorama|accessdate=6 April 2015|date=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{when?|date=December 2016}}

The single peaked at #16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles charts in early 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits: Eighth Edition |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=523}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the announcement of Reed's death in October 2013, both the song and the ''Transformer'' album re-charted via [[iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/lou-reed/73473|title=NME News Lou Reed to have posthumous hit with 'Walk On The Wild Side'? - NME.COM|date=28 October 2013|work=NME.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noel Harrison]], fresh from his role in the NBC series ''[[The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.|Girl From U.N.C.L.E.]]'', hosted the hour-long special. Comic skits were performed by [[Irwin Corey|Professor Irwin Corey]] and [[Don Adams]], who was starring in the NBC series [[Get Smart]].

Musical numbers were performed by [[The Association]], [[Barbara McNair]], [[Cher]] and [[The Byrds]]. The "Close-Up" for the program in the April 20–26, 1968 ''[[TV Guide]]'' also notes: "The goings-on include antic camerawork and a bevy of mini-clad beauties."

The special was broadcast on Tuesday, April 23, 1968. It pre-empted ''[[The Jerry Lewis Show]]'' on NBC's network schedule.
