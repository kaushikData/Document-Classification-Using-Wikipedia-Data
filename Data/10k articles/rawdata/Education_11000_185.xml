{{Distinguish|AP English Language and Composition}}
{{Advanced Placement}}
'''Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition''' (or '''AP English Literature and Composition''', '''AP Lit and Comp''', '''Senior AP English''', '''AP Lit''', or '''AP English IV''') is a course and examination offered by the [[College Board]] as part of the [[Advanced Placement Program]]. When AP exams were first implemented, English Language and English Literature were initially combined. They separated in 1980.

==The course==
Designated for motivated students with a command of standard [[English language|English]], an interest in exploring and analyzing challenging classical and contemporary [[literature]], and a desire to analyze and interpret dominant [[literary]] [[genre]]s and [[Theme (literature)|theme]]s, it is often offered to high school seniors and the other AP English course, AP English Language and Composition, to juniors. The College Board does not restrict courses by grade. Students learn and apply methods of literary analysis and write with a variety of purposes to increase precision in expression. Students in AP English Literature and Composition typically sit for the national AP examination administered each May for the College Board by the Educational Testing Service. The College Board publishes changing information about all AP courses and examinations on its web site.

On one of the three essays students write as part of the examination, students choose a work of literature they will write about. Readers of the exam who get an essay on a work they have not read typically pass the essay to a reader who has. The scoring guides that readers use to rate the essays are developed by experienced readers on site just before the reading begins each June, using some of the actual exam essays. Since those scoring guides do not exist before the Reading, instructors cannot teach to them but focus instead on encouraging text-based analysis.

== Commonly read literary works ==
The College Board publishes a recommended reading list, while emphasizing that it "does not mandate any particular authors or reading list." The reading list contains four major categories:

*[[Poetry]], ranging from the 16th century ([[William Shakespeare]]) to contemporary poets ([[Seamus Heaney]]);
*[[Drama]], ranging from [[Greek tragedy|Greek tragedies]] ([[Aeschylus]]) to post-modern [[absurdism|absurdist]]s ([[Tom Stoppard]]);
*[[Fiction]] &amp;ndash; [[novel]]s and [[short story|short stories]], from the 18th century comedies of manner of [[Jane Austen]] to the famous "[[Lost Generation]]" of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]];
*Expository prose ([[essay]]s), including [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[George Orwell]].

==Grade distributions==
In the 2012 administration, 380,608 students took the exam, with a mean score of 2.80.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap12_engl_lit_ScoringDist.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Independent research on the academic benefits of the Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition course indicates that not all students receive academic benefits from participating in the course. In a study with a sample size of over 90,000, the authors found that students who took the AP English Literature and Composition course did not receive any increase in academic achievement unless they also prepared for and took the AP test. The authors controlled for over 70 intervening variables and found that AP students who took and passed the English Composition and Literature exam had ACT scores that were 2.8 points higher than non-AP students or AP English students who did not take their course's AP test.&lt;ref name="Warne et al. (2015)"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Larsen|first2=Ross|last3=Anderson|first3=Braydon|last4=Odasso|first4=Alyce J.|date=2015|title=The impact of participation in the Advanced Placement program on students' college admissions test scores|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00220671.2014.917253|journal=The Journal of Educational Research|volume=108|issue=5|pages=400–416|doi=10.1080/00220671.2014.917253|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led the authors to state that AP participation "... is not beneficial to students who merely enroll in the courses ..."&lt;ref name="Warne et al.

Today in [[China]], there are more than 8,000 [[academic journal]]s, of which more than 4,600 can be considered scientific.&lt;ref&gt;Tian ZY. Thoughts on Chinese scholarly journals’ current condition and development. J Liaoning Technical University (Soc Sci Ed) 2003;5(1):107-9.&lt;/ref&gt; About 1,400 cover [[health science]] ([[medicine]] and [[public health]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dx2.tydata.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608001806/http://dx2.tydata.com/ |archivedate=2004-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journals==
Most scientific journals in China are supported by central, regional, or local governments. Some scientific journals are owned by [[professional association]]s. There are very few privately owned scientific journals. Some journals — mainly those supported by the national government — are regarded as high-prestige journals, and authors preferentially select these journals for their best papers. Lists of those top journals can be found at http://www.periodicals.net.cn, http://www.tydata.com, and http://www.cnki.net/. Such top-tier journals include the 67 journals published by the [[Chinese Medical Association]]. Those journals and most other academic journals are indexed by major indexing services in China.

Most scientific journals in China are published [[wikt:Monthly|monthly]], [[bimonthly]], or [[quarterly]].
A few are published twice a month. The average time to publication is 14.1 months.&lt;ref&gt;Wu CF. Trends regarding Western and Chinese journals. Sci Pub 2003;(2):12-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Most journals are available only in print form or only in electronic form. Most scientific journals in China are published in Chinese; a few have English translations of abstracts for research articles. Some 189 scientific journals are published in English, of which 29 are health-science journals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.periodicals.net.cn 中国数字化期刊群&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820091455/http://www.periodicals.net.cn/ |date=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most articles published in English-language scientific journals in China are indexed by [[Science Citation Index]] and [[Engineering Index]].&lt;ref&gt;Bi L. Status and analysis of English editions of Chinese science and technology periodicals. J Southeast University (Philosophy Soc Sci) 2002;4(1A):79-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientific journals in China are not published in English, which has meant that much of current scientific development in China is not readily available to non–Chinese-speaking scientists. A large portion of these journals however, also have an abstract in English.  
In 1999, only 661 Chinese journals were indexed in the international index systems:&lt;ref&gt;Xiang F. Coverage of Chinese scientific journals by six international indexing systems. Sci Pub 2002;(1):13-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Science Citation Index: 13&lt;br&gt;
* Engineering Index: 96&lt;br&gt;
* Index of Science and Technology Programs: 110&lt;br&gt;
* Science Abstracts: 117&lt;br&gt;
* Center for Biophotonics: Science and Technology: 132&lt;br&gt;
* Abstract Journal: 193 &lt;br&gt;
As of June 2001, 62 Chinese journals (44 in English) were indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded.&lt;ref&gt;Wu Q, Zhang GH, Zhu X. Evaluation of scientific journals and analysis of scientific publication by natural scientists at Beijing University. Sci Res Manag 2002;23(6):113-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The evaluation criteria for Chinese scientific journals are [[impact factor]], cited number of journal, reaction index, mean citing rate, and non-self-cited rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baike.com/wiki/中国学术期刊 |title=中国学术期刊 互动百科}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[impact factor]] of Chinese scientific journals is relatively low. In 1999, the top-cited journal—''Mining and Geologica Sinica''—had an impact factor of 1.487, and the average number of citations per article published in the Chinese journals covered by [[Science Citation Index]] was 0.326. One reason for the low impact factor is that Chinese scientists tend to use relatively few references in their publications (average, 6.6 references per article). A second reason is that scientists in China, like those in other countries, prefer to publish their best papers in major or top English-language journals. In fact, for such purposes as promotion to senior positions, Chinese scientists must have published in Western journals. According to the Institute of Science and Technology of China, the number of articles written by Chinese scientists and published in non-Chinese journals increased from 13,134 in 1995 to 24,476 in 1999—a 95% increase.

==Initiatives==
Chinese colleges and universities have few scientific-writing courses, so improvement in [[scientific writing]] is slow. Most first-time authors writing in Chinese for publication in China usually follow the format used in the journal to which they are submitting their manuscripts.

To improve scientific publishing in China, the government has instituted initiatives to improve scientific writing. A format for scientific and technical reports, degree theses, and scientific papers has been developed (GB7713-87). The recommendations closely follow international standards, including using the ''structured abstract'' for [[biomedical research]] articles. By supporting standards set by the government and international bodies, it is hoped that health science journals improve their scientific communication.

A few books about biomedical writing have now been published in China. Also, a program, based in China, to teach biomedical writing and editing has been established with grants from the [http://www.chinamedicalboard.org/ China Medical Board of New York]. The purpose of this program, which began in 1996, is to increase publication of Chinese and other Asian research in English-language biomedical journals both by providing instruction in biomedical writing and by developing editors at the researchers' institutions.

Typically the writing courses have focused on the ''introduction'' and ''discussion'' sections of articles prepared for health-science journals in China. The introduction section of the paper has tended to be incomplete, so editors and readers do not understand the point of the paper. Editors envisage the introduction as being rather like a funnel, beginning with what is known about the particular problem, leading to what is unknown and important to find out, and ending with the objectives of the research. Chinese authors typically begin the discussion with a reiteration of well-known knowledge, with little attempt to indicate how their research adds to the body of knowledge. The discussion section rarely discusses the limitations of the research.

Typical Chinese manuscripts contain few references. Although that may be a long-standing tradition in Chinese publishing, it also may occur because many university and local libraries in China lack extensive collections of world literature, most articles posted on the World Wide Web are not in free-access scientific journals, and, there is generally low awareness of international websites that provide free access to journals, such as [[Health InterNetwork Access to Research Initiative]] (HINARI; http://www.healthinternetwork.org/scipub.php) and the [[Directory of Open Access Journals]] (http://www.doaj.org).

'''Brain Bowl''' is an academic competition in which Florida Community College teams are pitted against one another. Teams consist of up to six players, only four of whom play at any given time.  A moderator reads questions from four subject areas including [[humanities]], mathematics, [[natural science]] and [[social sciences]].  Each area is equally represented.  A buzzer system is used to identify the player who answers first. Ten points are awarded for correctly answering the tossup question.  The team winning the tossup is eligible to win up to 30 points for correctly answering the follow-up bonus questions.  After 24 questions, the team that has accumulated the most points wins the game. No questions about [[popular culture]] or [[popular media|media]] are used in Brain Bowl.

==Florida Brain Bowl Purpose==

The purpose of Brain Bowl competition is to recognize outstanding student academic achievement, to help focus community interest on academic excellence in Florida community colleges and to help foster relations among faculty and students as they work together on this joint project.

==History and Scholarships==

Florida Brain Bowl was created in the fall of 1981 and until 1991 was a joint project of the Florida State Department of Education and the Florida College System Activities Association (FCSAA). Since 1991, the FCSAA has been the sole sponsor of the Brain Bowl.

After initially gaining the approval and support of the Florida Community College Council of Presidents, the fall of 1981 was spent developing rules and organizing regional competitions. The cash awards for the initial year came from a combination of funds from the legislative appropriation that established the Program to Recognize Initiative and Distinction in Education (PRIDE) and more than $12,000 that the founders of the Brain Bowl competition were able to raise from private sources.

Since its inception in 1981, the Florida Community Colleges Brain Bowl competition has involved more than 1,000 students in regional and state competitions. During that time,  the Florida Department of Education has awarded more than $80,000 to community college students who have competed in these tournaments.  Private colleges and universities, as well as state supported universities, have made available almost $1 million worth of scholarship opportunities. Each year the host school records the Championship match for future broadcast to the television viewers in the State of Florida.

&lt;!-- Note that the surname "Soloveitchik" can be spelled with or without the "t". Throughout this article, "Soloveitchik" is used as the default, with the alternate spelling used for those member of the family who spelled their names that way in English, such as Moshe and Ahron Soloveichik.--&gt;
[[File:Briskyeshiva.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Men learning in the Brisk Yeshiva in Jerusalem of Rabbi Avrohom Yehoshua Soloveitchik.]]
The '''Soloveitchik dynasty''' of [[rabbi]]nic scholars and their students originated the [[Brisker method]] of [[Talmud]]ic study, which is embraced by their followers in the '''Brisk yeshivas'''. It is so called because of the Soloveitchiks' origin in the town of Brisk, or [[Brest, Belarus|Brest-Litovsk]], located in what is now [[Belarus]]. Many of the first Soloveitchik rabbis were the official rabbis of Brisk, and each in turn was known as "the Brisker Rov". Today, '''Brisk''' refers to several [[yeshiva]]s in [[Israel]] and the [[United States]] founded by members of the Soloveitchik family.

==The Soloveitchik dynasty==
The Soloveitchik family includes many significant rabbinical forebears, most notably Rabbi [[Chaim Volozhin]]er, famed Talmudist and founder of the [[Volozhin yeshiva]]. Rabbi Chaim Volozhiner was a student of the [[Vilna Gaon]], and thus some students of Brisk talk of a line of tradition extending "from Moses at Sinai, to Joshua, to the Elders ... to the Vilna Gaon, to Rabbi Chaim Volozhiner, and then to the Soloveitchik dynasty".{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The Soloveitchik dynasty began with Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik known as the ''[[Yosef Dov Soloveitchik (Beis Halevi)|Beis HaLevi]]'', as he was the first rabbi of Brisk surnamed Soloveitchik. More significantly, the "Brisker style" described below can already be found to some degree in the Beis HaLevi's works, which is not the case for earlier ancestors.

All members of the Soloveitchik family are descended from the [[Levite|Tribe of Levi]] and thus sometimes go by the descriptor ''HaLevi''. The surname "Soloveitchik" comes from the word for [[nightingale]] in [[Slavic languages]]; it was chosen by the family because the primary duty of the Levites in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] was singing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===The Beis HaLevi===
{{Main|Yosef Dov Soloveitchik (Beis Halevi)}}
Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik (1820–1892), who is known by the title of his work, ''Beis HaLevi'', served as rabbi of Brisk for much of his life. The works on the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' and first five books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] which Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik authored were titled ''Beis HaLevi'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for "House of the Levites"). Many people therefore refer to him simply as the Beis HaLevi, which also avoids the confusion with his two great-grandsons of the same name: (1) the son of Rabbi [[Moshe Soloveichik]], Rabbi [[Joseph Soloveitchik]] (1903–1993) who moved to the [[United States]]; and (2) the son of Rabbi [[Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik]], Rabbi [[Berel Soloveitchik]], who lived in Israel.

The Beis HaLevi succeeded Rabbi [[Yehoshua Leib Diskin]] as rabbi of Brisk when the latter moved to Jerusalem in 1876. The Beis HaLevi had previously served as the rabbi of [[Slutzk]], and before that, on the faculty of the Volozhin yeshiva.

===Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik===
{{Main|Chaim Soloveitchik}}
The ''Beis HaLevi'', was succeeded as rabbi of Brisk by his son, Rabbi [[Chaim Soloveitchik]] (1853–1918). He is most commonly known as "Reb Chaim Brisker" (Rabbi Chaim from Brisk) where he implemented an analytic method of studying Talmudic that focuses on precise definition/s and categorization/s of [[Jewish law]] . His primary work was ''Chidushei Rav Chaim HaLevi'', a volume of insights on the ''Mishneh Torah'' which often would suggest novel understandings of the Talmud as well. He had three sons, Yitzchak Zev and Moshe and his oldest, Yisroel Gershon.

===Rabbi Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik===
{{Main|Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik}}
Rabbi Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik became known as ''The Brisker Rov'' when he succeeded his father as rabbi of Brisk. He was often known by the name ''Velvel''', a [[Yiddish (language)|Yiddish]] [[nickname]] for "little wolf".  (''Zev'' is [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for "wolf".) He is also commonly known as the "GRYZ", an [[acronym]] for '''G'''aon '''R'''abbi '''Y'''itzchak '''Zev''' ("genius rabbi Isaac Wolf"). He became famous enough that many people, however, refer to him simply as ''der Brisker Rov'' ("the rabbi of Brisk"). In fact, many in the Brisker yeshiva world in Israel refer to him simply as "The Rov". (In the Modern Orthodox community, his nephew, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, is referred to as "the Rav" or "the Rov".)

Like his father and grandfather, Rabbi Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik published works based on the ''Mishneh Torah'', often suggesting novel insights on the Talmud in the process. He fled the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and moved to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. His children and grandchildren live in Israel today, and have founded several yeshivas there, all known as "Brisk", based in [[Jerusalem]].

===Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik===
{{Main|Moshe Soloveichik}}
Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik's other famous son was Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik. His works on the [[Maimonides|Rambam]] are known as the ''Chiddushei haGram haLevi '' and "Chiddushei haGram ve'haGrid." He served as the Rabbi of Rasseyn and then of Chaslavich. He then moved to Warsaw where he served as [[rosh yeshiva]] of [[Tachkemoni Rabbinical Seminary]]. He moved to America in 1929 and was appointed as a rosh yeshiva at [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] (RIETS). (While RIETS has at no point ever called itself a "Brisk yeshiva" per se, it was home for many decades to Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik and later his sons.) His sons were the famous Rabbi [[Joseph Soloveitchik]], who lived in Boston and commuted to teach Talmud at [[Yeshiva University]] in Manhattan; Dr. [[Samuel Soloveichik]], a chemist as well as a Talmudic scholar; and Rabbi [[Ahron Soloveichik]], who taught at Mesivta Rabbi Chaim Berlin and then at Yeshiva University. Rav Ahron founded and was the rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Brisk in Chicago, Illinois.

===Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik===
{{Main|Joseph B. Soloveitchik}}
Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik was a son of Moshe Soloveichik. He succeeded his father as the senior Rosh Yeshiva of RIETS in New York. As he rose to become an important leader of Modern Orthodox Jewry, he ordained close to 2,000 rabbis over the course of almost half a century thereby strengthening his status as "The Rav"—as he was 'the rabbis's rabbi'.
He began the day school movement when he established [[Maimonides School]] as the one of the first [[Jewish day schools]] outside the New York area in 1937 after arriving in Boston with [[Tanya Levitt Soloveitchik]] in 1935 to be the [[mara d'atra]] of the greater Boston Jewish community. Today, Maimonides  maintains many of the Rav's radical educational posits including co-education and female [[Talmud]] study.
He is often accredited with being a primary founder of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodoxy]], a movement of Judaism which holds that Jews must both practice a [[Halakha|Halakhic]] life and embrace modernity. He also gave much needed validity to the Zionist effort in his famous work "Kol Dodi Dofek". Although he was primarily a brilliant Talmudist, his most famous works of "Lonely Man of Faith", "Catharsis", "Halachic Man", and "Ish HaEmunah" are largely philosophical.
A film called "The Lonely Man of Faith: the Life and Legacy of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik" documents the Rav's lifework and personality in greater detail.

===Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik===
{{Main|Ahron Soloveichik}}
Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik was a son of Moshe Soloveitchik. He taught at [[Mesivta]] Rabbi [[Chaim Berlin]] and then at [[Yeshiva University]]. He eventually moved to Chicago and became rosh yeshiva at the [[Hebrew Theological College]] and in 1974 founded his own yeshiva [[Yeshivas Brisk of Chicago]]. After his brother Joseph became ill, beginning in 1986 he began to commute to New York City to lecture at [[RIETS]] as well. Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik died in 2001, and Yeshivas Brisk of Chicago became defunct a few years later as a Mesivta but remains active today as a [[Beth Medrash]] under Rabbi Ahron's eldest son, Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik. His grandchildren include Rabbi Shmuel Marcus, philosopher Rabbi Dr. [[Meir Soloveichik]], and political analyst [[Nechama Soloveichik]]. Rabbi Dr. [[David Applebaum]] was considered one of his most outstanding and devoted disciples.

===Rabbi Meshulam Dovid Soloveitchik===
Rabbi [[Meshulam Dovid Soloveitchik]] (known as Reb Dovid) is the son of Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik. He is rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Brisk in the [[Gush Shemonim]] section of Jerusalem. He has yet to publish any works on the Talmud, but many of his lectures have been published by his students. He is considered by Briskers to be one of the last authentic remnants of a pre-World War II Jewish Lithuania.

===Rabbi Meir Soloveitchik===
Rabbi Meir Soloveitchik was the son of Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik and headed one of the Brisker Yeshivas in Jerusalem, which was attended by many Torah scholars, including the current [[Izhbitza (Hasidic dynasty)|Radziner]] [[Rebbe]], Grand Rabbi Moshe Leiner. He should not be confused with Rabbi [[Meir Soloveichik]] the son of Rabbi [[Ahron Soloveichik]]'s son Rabbi [[Eliyahu Soloveichik]]. He died at the age of 87 on April 2, 2016.

===Rabbi Avrohom Yehoshua Soloveitchik===
[[File:Yeshivas Brisk, Jerusalem.jpg|175px|left|thumb|Façade of Yeshivas Brisk on Press Street, Jerusalem.]]
Rabbi [[Avrohom Yehoshua Soloveitchik]] is the grandson of Rabbi [[Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik]]. He succeeded his father, Rabbi [[Berel Soloveitchik]], as the rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Brisk in Jerusalem.

==Philosophy==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2011}}

===General===
In contrast to the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement, all of the Soloveichik rabbis were a part of the [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] yeshiva movement, and thus were strong believers in a traditional Talmudic education and, to a certain degree, [[intellect]] over [[emotion]]. &lt;!--(It should be noted that Chabad Chassidim also believe that the intellectual components should override the emotive -- however, as all Chassidim they believe that in modern times, Judaism without emotion is deficient.)--&gt; However, Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik made it clear that he was very much in touch with Hasidism, having lived for several years in Chaslavich, which was mostly Hasidic.

===Halachic===
The "Brisk dynasty" and their followers (known as "Briskers") are known for a tendency towards strictness in the Halakha (Jewish law); if there is ever a doubt between two rabbinic opinions, the "Brisk way" is more likely to follow the more stringent one. They maintain that we are unable to determine Halacha as following one opinion over another. They instead are stringent in the sense that they will look to fulfill the opinion of all early Halachic authorities. For example, many yeshiva students will not only not shave their [[payot]] (sidelocks), as required by the [[Torah]], but will also let the entire area grow very long, which they tuck behind their ears- as required by certain early Halachic authorities. These are known as "Brisker Peyos," or "Briskers."

Following the Reb Velvel (the "Brisker Rav," see above), many Briskers in Israel are very stringent in [[ritual tithes]] ("trumos uma'asros" in Hebrew). They repeat the [[Shema Yisrael|Krias Shema]] many times, each time with a different possible pronunciation, in order to make sure they fulfill the Biblical command. They crush soda cans after drinking from them to rule out any possibility of using the container more than once without its required immersion in a [[mikveh]].

===Talmudic===
The innovative Brisk, or "conceptual" style of Talmudic analysis is described in the [[Brisker method]] article.

===Political===
A great deal of controversy has erupted regarding the political sidings of the rabbis of Brisk. Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik and his descendants, who settled in Israel, have made their opinion clear that they oppose a secular [[Zionism|Zionist]] state and thus show no support for the Israeli government. They are members of the [[Eidah Hachareidis]], together with Satmar and other Hasidic groups, and follow all of the Eidah's opinions. For example, they do not accept any money from the Israeli government, and frequently participate in protests organized by the Eidah to protest actions by the Israeli government they perceive as anti-religious. They are also opposed to yeshiva students having a secular [[college]] education.

In contrast, most of the Soloveitchiks who moved to the United States, including Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik and his brother Rabbi Aaron Soloveitchik, were very supportive of the [[State of Israel]] as well as what they perceive as a well-rounded college education. They were far more supportive than the general [[Ultra-Orthodox]] American Jewry. Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik became the accepted leader of the [[Modern Orthodox]] movement, with the yeshiva he headed, [[Yeshiva University]], becoming the Modern Orthodox flagship institution. Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik was the American head of [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]], the organization of religious Zionists. His followers generally identify themselves with Mizrachi, and are strong supporters of the State. Rabbi Soloveitchik was even a candidate for [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Tel Aviv]] at one point, but was outvoted by supporters for Rabbi [[Moshe Avigdor Amiel]].

Turning to their forebears, Rabbi Chaim Brisker is quoted with some harsh statements against Zionism, though he lived in an era when [[Anti-Zionism#Religious opposition|Haredi anti-Zionism]] was far more prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Anti-Zionism#Religious opposition]] page for more on historical trends of Haredi anti-Zionism.&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to feminism, Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik was proud to point out that on his parents' wedding invitation, his grandparents are listed as "Chaim &amp; Lifsha" on one line, with "Soloveitchik" on the next line, centered between their names. This could be seen as more feminist than the "Rabbi &amp; Mrs. So-And-So" (or in Hebrew, "Ploni BenPloni V'Rayaso") seen in many [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] invitations today.

Today, however, most adherents of the Israeli Soloveitchiks follow the general Israeli Haredi, i.e. strongly right-wing, worldview regarding women's role in Jewish education and communal life.  Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik, and many of his students and descendants, on the other hand, have been guardedly more open to opportunities for women, Rabbi Soloveitchik himself delivering the opening Talmud lecture at Yeshiva University's [[Stern College for Women]].

Thus, given how the world has changed in the 20th century, and given the strong and varied views of their descendants, the views of Rabbi Chaim Brisker and the Beis HaLevi on Zionism, secular education, religious [[feminism]], and [[modernism]] in general, are topics of current discussion.

The club was located on the premises of the Rangoon Government High School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mirrored in wood: Burmese art and architecture|authors=Irene Moilanen and Sergeĭ Sergeevich Ozhegov|publisher=White Lotus Press|year= 1999|isbn=974-7534-00-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It afforded a twofold opportunity: first, it was a means to  develop the British colonial painters' own talents and second, they were able to teach Western style painting to others in Burma.&lt;ref name="Barron &amp; Okell" /&gt;

BAC was founded by amateur British colonial painters.&lt;ref name="Barron &amp; Okell" /&gt;  This included Kenneth Martin Ward, Professor of Physics at [[University of Yangon|Rangoon University]]; Martin Jones, Railways Commissioner who drew for the ''Rangoon Times'', and E.G.N. Kinch, the principal of Saint Methew Teachers Training College.&lt;ref name="thavibu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thavibu.com/articles/ATC29.htm|title=Evolution of Myanmar (Burmese) Painting|date=5 April 2006|accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were assisted by Commissioner Hla Aung, his wife Mya May,&lt;ref name="Zin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artstreammyanmar.net/writing/Research/mmwomen.htm|title=Myanmar Women Artists|last=Zin|first=Daw Khin Mya|date=Dec 2003|work=Networking &amp; Initiatives for Culture &amp; the Arts|publisher=artstreammyanmar.net|accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and young Burmese artists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=huXVAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Burma+Art+Club&amp;dq=Burma+Art+Club&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nNXeTIqMD8mbhQeyrOzUDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCQ|authors=[[Khin Maung Nyunt]], Sein Myo Myint (U.), Thanegi (Ma.)|title=Myanmar painting: from worship to self-imaging|publisher=Education Pub.

==History==
[[File:Shwedagon-Pano.jpg|thumb|The Burma Art Club participated in the Japanese Post-War Art Exhibition at the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]]]

===Early years===
Ward became BAC's first president with architect [[Tha Tun]] acting as Secretary. Hla Aung and Mya May arranged for the teachers and students to stay at their residence. They also allowed Ward to teach art at the Boys Buddhist School, which was owned by them. Daw Mya May became known as "the mother of Myanmar artists".&lt;ref name="Zin" /&gt; BAC offered several courses such as still-life and portrait painting, as well as outdoor and indoor paintings on weekends. While the Burmese painters affiliated with the club accepted [[Depictions of nudity|realistically painted nudes]] as [[art]], very few of them attempted to paint nudity themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Nyunt, (snippet view), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The club was known to concentrate on system and method, earning it the nickname of "Labyrinth of Technique" amongst those in the art circle.&lt;ref name="thavibu" /&gt;

In 1920, the school expanded its classes, Ward himself taught oil painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thavibu.com/articles/ATC30.htm|title=Old Myanmar Paintings in the Collection of U Win|publisher=Thavibu|accessdate=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ba Nyan, developer of the "Rangoon School",&lt;ref name="burmalibrary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burmalibrary.org/reg.burma/archives/199705/msg00643.html|title=Art|date=16 May 1997|work=burmalibrary.org|publisher=Burma Issues|accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; became an art instructor in basic design.&lt;ref name="magicartartgallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magicartartgallery.com/arthistory/?v=detail&amp;id1=23&amp;rec=P-122|title=Ba Nyan Artwork  ''The Bridge''|work=magicartartgallery.com|accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that decade, club member painters, Ba Nyan and Ba Zaw, were able study in London at the Royal College of Art.&lt;ref name="Barron &amp; Okell" /&gt; Also in the 1920s, the founding members introduced students to British [[cartoon]] art.&lt;ref name="Law-Yone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silkwormbooks.com/reviews/burmese-painting-law-yone/|title=Burmese Painting: A Linear and Lateral History|last=Law-Yone|first=Wendy|publisher=Britain-Burma Society|accessdate=17 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810235223/http://www.silkwormbooks.com/reviews/burmese-painting-law-yone/|archivedate=10 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Ba Nyan's return to Burma, he brought back a bold style of oil painting while Ba Zaw returned with a stylized form of transparent watercolor painting.&lt;ref name="Barron, p. 14"&gt;Barron, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Though art instruction continued at the club until World War II, some painters such as Ba Nyan began a new form instruction at their homes, that of master-apprentice training.&lt;ref name="Barron, p. 14"/&gt; The school was important in launching the careers of talented young artists such as Ba Nyan. In 1939, Ba Nyan himself became principal of the Art School.&lt;ref name=Yliopisto&gt;{{cite book |pages=74–76 |chapter=U Ba Nyan and the Burma Art Club |title=Jyväskylä studies in the arts, Issues 46-47 |author=Jyväskylä (Finland) Yliopisto |publisher=Yliopisto |year=1995 |ISBN=951-34-0442-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, during the Japanese occupation, Ba Nyan led a group of artists that opened the school's successor,  the [[Burmese Academy of Art]], becoming the principal of the academy with Ba Kyi and [[San Win]] as instructors. Two years later, an English Army art club and the Burma Art Club participated together in the Japanese Post-War Art Exhibition (Services Art Exhibition) at the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]].&lt;ref name="thavibu" /&gt;

==Notable alumni==
Many young Burmese artists learned to draw and paint from the British artists. Those who went on to become famous national artists include Ba Gyan, Hein Sunn, Saya Mya, Ba Zaw, and Ohn Lwin.&lt;ref name="Zaw" /&gt; Ba Gale ("Shwetalay"), was the club’s most famous alumnus. His first published cartoon appeared in the Yangon University annual in 1915,&lt;ref name="Pwint"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no455/t001.htm|title=Myanmar’s first online cartoon website launched|last=Pwint|first=Zon Pann|date=26 January – 1 February 2009|work=Myanmar Times &amp; Business Review|accessdate=17 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604185158/http://www.mmtimes.com/no455/t001.htm#|archive-date=4 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he was a college student there. In the same year, Ba Gale's work was published in the ''Rangoon Times'', becoming the first newspaper to publish a cartoon by a Burmese artist.&lt;ref name="Zaw" /&gt; In March 1917, the very first issue of ''Thuriya'' ("The Sun"), a paper run by young nationalists, carried a Ba Gale cartoon.&lt;ref name="Pwint" /&gt;

'''Chitresh Das''' ([[Devanagari]]: {{lang|hi|चित्रेश दास}}) (9 November 1944 – 4 January 2015) was a classical dancer of the North Indian style of [[Kathak]].  Born in Calcutta, Das was a performer, choreographer, composer and educator.  He was instrumental in bringing Kathak to the US&lt;ref&gt;Chakravorty, Pallabi. 2007. "Bells of Change: Kathak Dance, Women and Modernity in India”.  Seagull Books: Calcutta, pp89&lt;/ref&gt; and is credited with having firmly established Kathak amongst the Indian diaspora in America.&lt;ref&gt;Kothari, Sunil. 2004. “Dance of the masters.” From The Hindu Magazine Sunday,    21 Nov: http://www.hinduonnet.com/mag/2004/11/21/stories/2004112100460500.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979, Das established the Chhandam School of Kathak and the Chitresh Das Dance Company in California.  In 2002, he founded Chhandam Nritya Bharati in India. Today, there over ten branches of Chhandam worldwide.  Until his death in 2015, Das taught dance as a way of life, a path for attaining self-knowledge and as a service to society.

Pandit Das performed and taught to audiences around the world, frequently touring through India, North America and Europe. He was well known for his virtuosic footwork, rhythmic adeptness, compelling storytelling,&lt;ref&gt;Ullrich, Alan. 2008.  “Pure Citresh”. {{cite web |url=http://www.voiceofdance.com/v1/features.cfm/1622/Pure-Chitresh-Pandit |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716192020/http://www.voiceofdance.com/v1/features.cfm/1622/Pure-Chitresh-Pandit |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his own innovation of “Kathak Yoga”.&lt;ref&gt;Kathak Yoga in California” in the Telegraph, Sunday 23 March 2008, http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080323/jsp/calcutta/story_9024016.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and background==
Chitresh Das was born in [[Calcutta]], [[West Bengal]] to parents Nrityacharya Prohlad Das and Smt. Nilima Das. His parents founded “Nritya Bharati,” one of India’s first institutions for dance that housed teachers of several classical and folk styles. Prohlad Das, himself a dance scholar and choreographer, used traditional dance forms to express modern issues, such as in his revolutionary work “Abhyudaya” (meaning “awakening”) staged before Indian Independence in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Morelli, Sarah. 2007. PhD Dissertation. “From Calcutta to California”: Negotiations of Movement and Meaning in Kathak Dance. Harvard University: Cambridge, Massachusetts, pp34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Das frequently cited his mother, Nilima Das, for having had a profound impact on his life as a dancer, often stating, “mother is the first guru”.

Growing up in his parents' dance school in Calcutta, Nritya Bharati, Pandit Das was surrounded by great literary artists, poets, dancers, and gurus of the times.  He recalled fond memories of iconic dancers such as [[Rukmini Devi Arundale]], [[Uday Shankar]], [[Balasaraswati]] and the legendary [[Shambhu Maharaj]] coming to visit his home.

With encouragement from his mother, Das began his study of Kathak at age 9 under Kathak guru, Pandit Ram Narayan Misra, a well-known disciple of Shambhu and Acchchan Maharaj.  Das was schooled in both major Kathak traditions, embodying each in his artistry: the graceful and sensual elements of the Lucknow school combined with the dynamic and powerful rhythms and movements of the Jaipur School.

Das was a child prodigy in India who quickly attained national fame, performing at age 11 with the legendary tabla maestro Samta Prasadji and in a special concert for the great Indian dance icon Uday Shankar.  Das graduated from [[Rabindra Bharati University]] in Calcutta and earned his M.A. in dance from [[Prayag Sangit Samiti]] in Allahabad.

==Teaching career==
Chitresh Das came to the [[United States]] in 1970 on a Whitney Fellowship to teach Kathak at the [[University of Maryland]].  In 1971, Pandit Das was invited by Ustad [[Ali Akbar Khan]] to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to teach Kathak and establish a dance program at the [[Ali Akbar College]] of Music (AACM) in [[San Rafael, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Morelli, Sarah. 2007, pp8.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1979, he left the AACM faculty to form his own dance school called Chhandam; his "Chitresh Das Dance Company" (CDDC) was incorporated in 1980.  In 1988, Das formed the first university accredited Kathak course in the US at [[San Francisco State University]]; several current dancers of CDDC began studying with Das in the SFSU program. Das was also a guest faculty member at [[Stanford University]].

His own school of Chhandam has continued to grow with branches in San Francisco, Fremont/Union City, Berkeley, Mountain View, San Jose, Sacramento, and Los Angeles.  His disciples, [[Joanna De Souza]] and Gretchen Hayden went on to establish branches of Chhandam in Toronto (1990) and Boston (1992), respectively.  Today, Chhandam currently has 550 students enrolled at branches across North America.&lt;ref&gt;Keleher, Maureen. 2010. "The Journey of Kathak".  In Dance Studio Life, pp82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the years Das would return annually for several months to India to teach and perform.  In 2002, Pandit Das reopened his parents' school of Chhandam Nritya Bharati in Calcutta, India.

In 2010, [[Seema Mehta]], one of his disciples and Pandit Das founded the second branch of his school in India, Chhandam Nritya Bharati, in Mumbai.  While in India, Pandit Das continued his work with the New Light Foundation, teaching Kathak dance to the children of sex workers of the Kalighat red light district in Calcutta as a part of a program to help them break free of the cycle of exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Sandip. 2006 http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061029/asp/look/story_6914758.asp#&lt;/ref&gt;

As he was trained by his Guru, Pandit Ram Narayan Misra, Das trained his own students, both in the US and India, within the guru-shisya parampara (the tradition of master and disciple).  A Guru is “one who removes the darkness” through direct knowledge and training.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guru]]&lt;/ref&gt; Das was said to have remained committed to preserving the traditional one-to-one transmission of knowledge between guru and shisya in today's society; he trained many disciples who have gone on to become solo artists in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;Dalidowicz, Monica. 2010.

==Performing career==
Pandit Chitresh Das performed extensively throughout America, India and Europe, touring both as a solo artist, in collaborative productions, as well as with the Chitresh Das Dance Company.
Das routinely toured and performed throughout India. Select performances within India included the Surya festival (1982); [[Pandit Ravi Shankar]]'s Rimpa Festival in Benares (1983), representing his home state of West Bengal in tours throughout India (1998, 1999), Dover Lane Conference, Kolkata (1979, 1982, 1984, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2003); National Kathak Festival in New Delhi (2003), Fort William, Kolkata (2005) where he performed before 4,000 Indian soldiers, UMAQ Festival, New Delhi (2004, 2006, 2007), US Consulate 50th Anniversary in Mumbai (2008), Karamatullah Khan Festival in Kolkata (2008), Mumbai Festival (2008), 50th Anniversary Festival, IIT Kharagpur, India (2009) amongst others.

In the early 1970s, Das also began performing extensively throughout the United States. In 1984 Das was selected to perform in the Olympic Arts Festival during the Los Angeles Olympic Games.  Other select American performances include the Lincoln Center (1988), International Kathak festival in Chicago (2004), American Dance Festival (2004, 2006), and the American Folk festival (2008).

The original IJS collaboration was selected as the number one dance performance of 2005 by the San Francisco Chronicle&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Rachel. 2005. http://www.sfgate.com/cgibin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/12/25/PKG0SGAMT61.DTL&lt;/ref&gt; as well as receiving the Isadora Duncan Ensemble of the year award (2005).  Since IJS has toured extensively, including four tours to India,&lt;ref&gt;Ghungroo and Tap shoes. 2008. The Times of India. {{cite web |url=http://www.kathak.org/altruesite/files/kathak/IndiaJazzSuites/ghungroo_tap_times.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723103256/http://www.kathak.org/altruesite/files/kathak/IndiaJazzSuites/ghungroo_tap_times.jpg |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; performances across America,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Karen. 2010.

In 2006, the Chitresh Das and Chhandam organized a festival of Kathak dance in San Francisco, the largest Kathak festival ever to take place outside of India;&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Rachel. 2006. Review. http://www.sfgate.com/cgibin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/03/DDGPOLFNVO1.DTL&amp;type=performance&lt;/ref&gt; it brought together Kathak dancers from all over the world.  Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] of San Francisco inaugurated the festival by proclaiming 28 Sep "Kathak Day".&lt;ref&gt;Proclamation from Mayor Newsom. {{cite web |url=http://www.kathak.org/site/kathak/content.php?type=1&amp;id=10139 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723103312/http://www.kathak.org/site/kathak/content.php?type=1&amp;id=10139 |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In earlier years, Das also performed throughout Europe, including Bonn and Aachen International Dance Festivals (1983), Logan Hall in London (1984), and Nijmegen and Arnhem, Holland (1984).  In the late eighties, he also performed throughout in Germany, Poland, and Hungary with Tanzprojekt.

In 2004, Pandit Das was featured on a national PBS program, and in a BBC series "Eighty Treasures Around the World"; the program featured Pandit Das performing in a historic court in Calcutta.&lt;ref&gt;See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhlPYhww7Bc&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also featured in the PBS series “Indians in America”.  In January 2005 and 2006, Pandit Das’ solo performances were featured on national Indian television. In 2007, he was featured on PBS station KQED’s performing arts profile show Spark.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.kqed.org/arts/programs/spark/profile.jsp?essid=16485&lt;/ref&gt;

Das’s collaboration with Jason Samuel Smiths is the subject of a documentary, ‘Upaj,’ nationally broadcast on PBS in 2011.  Das also appeared on the popular Indian talk show “Oye! Its Friday” show filmed in Mumbai in 2009.

==Style and contributions==
“Freedom comes through refined discipline with responsibility.”

In the early years, Das was known for his distinctively athletic style: fast and powerful emphasising footwork and swift turns.&lt;ref&gt;Morelli, Sarah. 2007 (see also Chakravorty 1999 PhD Dissertation. Choreographing Modernity: Kathak Dance, Public Culture and Women’s Identity in India. Temple University)&lt;/ref&gt;  Das taught in this rigorous style with focus on tayari (readiness of technique, speed, and stamina) and laykari (virtuosity of Indian classical rhythmic system), but equally emphasises khubsurti (beauty) and nazakat (delicacy and refinement).  Dancers must become adept at abhinaya (expression) and learn to masterfully portray the concept of 'Ardhanariswara' (the embodiment of the masculine and feminine) in their dance.

Das’s teaching and performance also emphasise Upaj, or improvisation.  Whilst Das has choreographed many group pieces, he and his students continue to present traditional full-length Kathak solos, requiring the dancer to improvise on stage with live musicians for up to two hours.&lt;ref&gt;Swapan, Ashfaque. 2008. “Kathak Maestro Chitresh Das Mezmerizes Audience”. Indiawest Archives, 15 October 2008. [see also Narang, Shalini, “Improvisation Hallmark of Kathak’s Solo”, Indiawest, 7 December 2009, http://www.indiawest.com/readmore.aspx?id=1648&amp;Sid=8Improvisation{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Das's most important contributions to his school and to the larger field of Kathak is his development of "[[Kathak yoga]]".  Kathak yoga involves the practice of simultaneously dancing, singing, and often, playing an instrument.  In Kathak yoga, the dancer recites a chosen taal (rhythmic cycle), sings the melody and the theka (language of the drum) of the taal, while practising precise complicated footwork.&lt;ref&gt;Also see Howard, Rachel. 2006. https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/arts/dance/24howa.html?scp=1&amp;sq=kathak+yoga&amp;st=nyt&lt;/ref&gt;  Kathak yoga is based on the fundamental yogic concept of integrating the mind, soul and body and was the subject of a doctoral dissertation at [[Harvard University]] by Dr. Sarah Morelli.  Das himself has demonstrated Kathak yoga by dancing, singing, and playing tabla simultaneously. His company also exhibits the practice of Kathak yoga by adding the playing of instruments to their dance.&lt;ref&gt;See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNOLB5AJS6Y&lt;/ref&gt;  The dancers simultaneously perform three contrasting concepts – complex rhythmic compositions with the feet and body, continuous singing of the rhythmic cycle, and playing an instrument (harmonium or manjira).

==Selected awards==
In 1987, and then again in 2003, Das was awarded the Isadora Duncan Dancer of the Year Award.  In 2004 Pandit Das received the inaugural lifetime achievement award from the San Francisco Ethnic Dance Festival.  In 2005, he was named a “Dance Icon of the West” by the San Francisco Performing Arts Library and Museum.  In 2006 Pandit Das received the Goldie Lifetime Achievement Award from the San Francisco Bay Guardian.  In 2007, Das received an award from [[Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan]], a national arts institution inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi in India in 1938, for outstanding contribution in the field of Kathak dance!!!

In 2009, Pandit Das was awarded the [[National Heritage Fellowship]], the highest honour bestowed on a traditional artist by the US Government.  Das received the award, signed by President Obama, at a ceremony at the Library of Congress on Capitol Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.endow.gov/honors/heritage/fellows/NHFIntro.php?year=2009 |title=2009 NEA National Heritage Fellowships: Introduction |publisher=Arts.endow.gov |date= |accessdate=29 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226234025/http://arts.endow.gov/honors/heritage/fellows/NHFIntro.php?year=2009 |archivedate=26 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Das's productions also received numerous awards, including Isadora Duncan Awards for his productions 'East of Center' (2003), India Jazz Suites (2005) as well as a special award for presenting the largest Indian classical dance festival outside of India, Kathak at the Crossroads (2006).

Pandit Das also received numerous grants including from the Olympic Arts Festival, [[National Endowment for the Arts]], National Dance Project, California Arts Council, Rockefeller Foundation, Irvine Fellowships in Dance, among others.

==Serving society through the arts==
Das began working with the New Light Foundation, a Kolkata-based NGO that works to free the children of red-light district workers from the cycle of prostitution and abuse through support services, education and care, in 2003.  Das and the teachers of Nritya Bharati taught the children of the New Light Foundation Kathak dance as a means for cultural and self-awareness and empowerment.  The New Light group was invited by the German Ministry of Culture and International Cooperation to be a part of Kinder Kulture Karavane; in 2008, the New Light children travelled to Germany for a 6-week performing tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newlightindia.org/newsletter/December2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727121414/http://www.newlightindia.org/newsletter/December2008.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Das also worked with the Calcutta Blind Opera (or Shyambazar Blind Opera), teaching Kathak to visually challenged performers through emphasis on its rhythmic and musical components.

Das's teachings emphasized the concepts of ‘tyaag aur seva’ (sacrifice and selfless service).  Das encouraged the students of Chhandam to adopt his values of selflessness and sacrifice.  He argued that these values must manifest both within the context of their study of Kathak and also permeate in other aspects of their lives by giving back to their communities and the society by and large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathak.org/site/kathak/section.php?id=9123 |title=Chitresh Das Dance Company |publisher=Kathak.org |date= |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Das married his first wife, Julia Maxwell, in 1971 and they divorced in 1987.  He married his second wife, Celine Schein, in 1999, and they were married until his death.  Das and Celine had two children, Shivaranjani, born August 15, 2011, and Saadhvi, born July 4, 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9015">{{Inadequate lead|date=September 2013}}'''Copyright Clearance Center''' ('''CCC''') is a U.S. company based in [[Danvers, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref name="PrivCo"&gt;[http://www.privco.com/private-company/copyright-clearance-center PrivCo Private Company Financial Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt; (although it is incorporated in [[New York State]]),&lt;ref name="PrivCo" /&gt; that provides collective [[copyright]] licensing services for corporate and academic users of copyrighted materials. CCC procures agreements with rightsholders, primarily [[academic publishers]], and then acts as their agent in arranging collective licensing for institutions and one-time licensing for document delivery services, [[coursepacks]], and other access and uses of texts.

==History==
CCC was founded in 1978 as a not-for-profit organization in response to negotiations preceding the United States [[Copyright Act of 1976]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The [[I.R.S.]] revoked CCC's tax-exempt status in 1982 and the [[United States Tax Court]] affirmed that holding, finding that whatever public benefits CCC's activities might produce, its primary purpose was to "further[] the economic interest of publishers and copyright owners" and its founders (a group of publishers) had no "interests of any substance beyond the creation of a device to protect their copyright ownership and collect license fees."&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright Clearance Center v. Commissioner'', 79 T.C. 793 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; CCC still maintains a state-level not-for-profit status in the [[State of New York]], but for federal purposes is a for-profit company.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Licensing work ==
The CCC is a broker of licenses,&lt;ref name="zubin"&gt;Zick Rubin, [http://chronicle.com/article/Lets-Spread-the-Word-About/134544/ "Let's Spread the Word About Fair Use"], ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', Sept. 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; earning a 15% commission on the fees it collects.&lt;ref name="zubin" /&gt; The company passes more than 70% of its revenues to publishers in the form of Royalty Payments to Rightholders, and another 30% is kept by the company as a fee for its services.&lt;ref name="PrivCo" /&gt;

CCC is a primarily US-based rights broker for materials, including millions of in- and out-of-print books, journals, [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, movies, television shows, images, blogs and [[e-book]]s.  CCC licenses copyright-protected content to businesses and academic institutions, and compensates publishers and content creators for the use of their works.  [[Amsterdam]]-based RightsDirect, the wholly owned [[Europe]]an subsidiary of Copyright Clearance Center established in 2010, provides copyright licensing services for European-based companies for print and digital content in books, journals, newspapers, magazines and images.

The "collective licensing" model that CCC employs is distinct from [[Statutory license|statutory licensing]], in that it is voluntary, as opposed to mandated by statute.  As a voluntary industry-developed model, CCC has been able to develop and initiate a variety of different licensing schemes, as well as to litigate and legislate on behalf of rightsholders.  The voluntary licenses available from Copyright Clearance Center are of two kinds: repertory (or, annual) and transactional. The license systems are offered through various services, for instance, to corporations (the Annual Copyright License) or to academic institutions (the Academic Permissions Service, among others). Through these, and multiple other mechanisms, CCC collects fees which represent royalty payments and then periodically distributes these monies to participating rightsholders. CCC meets its operating expenses through allocating a fraction of these fees.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Products==

In 2000, CCC released ''RightsLink'', a product that handles automated permission and reprint requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |editor-last=Rupp-Sorrano |editor-first=Karen |title=Licensing In Libraries |chapter=Copyright Clearance Center |last=Armstrong |first=Tracey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbOnGRB1Z60C |accessdate=June 30, 2013 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Psychology Press]] |isbn=9780789028792 |pages=61&amp;ndash;63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CCC later expanded into the [[Search engine technology|search]] domain, with a suite collectively known as ''RightsFind''. To expand this, the company acquired [[Pubget]], a search engine for scientists, in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/03/florence-healthcare-raises-1-7-million-to-move-clinical-trials-research-off-paper-into-the-cloud/|title=Florence Healthcare raises $1.7 million to move clinical trials research off paper, into the cloud|date=3 March 2016|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this was subsequently closed in 2017. In 2014 the company acquired Infotrieve, a [[text mining]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/NewsBreaks/Copyright-Clearance-Center-Acquires-Infotrieve-100601.asp|title=Copyright Clearance Center Acquires Infotrieve|date=18 November 2014|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the company announced that ''RightsFind'' could now allow users to search CCC for documents and then export them into 3rd party text mining software, currently limited to only [[Linguamatics]] or Scibite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/NewsBreaks/Copyright-Clearance-Center-Explores-New-Paths-for-RightFind-105785.asp|title=Copyright Clearance Center Explores New Paths for RightFind|date=18 August 2015|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobbying and litigation ==

'''Dodgeball''' refers to a collection of [[team sports]] in which players on two teams try to throw balls at each other while avoiding being hit themselves.

There are many variations of the game, but generally the main objective of each team is to eliminate all members of the opposing team by hitting them with thrown balls, catching a ball thrown by a member of the opposing team, or forcing them to move outside the court boundaries when a ball is thrown at them.

Internationally, there are currently two world bodies: [http://www.worlddodgeballfederation.com/ World Dodgeball Federation (WDBF)], which uses foam, and the World Dodgeball Association (WDA), which uses cloth. The international dodgeball day is April 27th. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Equipment==
[[File:Dodgeball on court.JPG|thumb|A dodgeball on a court, prior to the beginning of the match.]]
[[File:8th Annual International Dodgeball Tournament of CHAMPIONS! Hamline 2014 8.webm|thumb|Dodgeball game, 2014]]
The number of dodgeballs used in the game often varies, but three to ten are common. Exceptions are usually made if a court is particularly small or if many people participate. More balls generally adds to the amount of action in a game, but can result in stalemate with many blocks. World Dodgeball Association rules are played with five (international dodgeball is played with 6) balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules and Regulations of Dodgeball|url=http://dodgeball.at/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/WDA-International-Rules-Guide_English-Version_Februar2016.pdf|website=Dodgeball Austria|publisher=World Dodgeball Association|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An odd number is generally favorable as one team will necessarily have a majority of balls in possession and should take the offensive role.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Dodgeball is played with many different types of dodgeballs. The three most used are foam, rubber and cloth depending on the organizations that endorse the sport. Rubber is mostly played in the United States while Foam and Cloth are played in at least 16 countries worldwide.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Court==
[[File:NDL court diagram.png|thumb|left|An example of a dodgeball court used in the National Dodgeball League]]
A typical dodgeball game is usually played on a basketball court, volleyball court, fenced area or even an Australian Rules Football oval or soccer pitch. There is no fixed dodgeball court design. The game is picked on the best available surface that is usually one of the above-mentioned. Unless it is a variation of dodgeball, the court must have a center line.

==Rules of game==
[[File:NDL amateur game.jpg|thumb|right|Dodgeball players preparing for the opening rush]]
[[File:USMC-080816-M-9999S-002.jpg|thumb|The opening rush of a dodgeball game.]]
At the beginning of a dodgeball game, the balls are lined up on the central dividing line (in some versions of the game, the balls are thrown in the air for the players to catch or divided evenly to both teams before a match). The players then simultaneously rush towards the center line and try to grab one of the dodgeballs and throw or roll it backwards to their teammates; players cannot pick up a ball and throw it instantly. In some versions there is a "check line" that the dodgeballs have to be behind before they can be considered "live." This is known as the opening rush. Once the game has commenced, players throw balls at members of the opposing team in an attempt to eliminate the players.

When a player has been hit by a dodgeball "on the full" (i.e. without hitting the roof, the floor, any of the walls, or an outside object and rebounding off) and no one catches it before it becomes dead, that player has been eliminated and must move to his team's designated bench area (players are still out if the ball rebounds off another dodgeball and/or player and hits them on the full). The same rule applies if any number of people try to catch the ball but drop it. Depending on the rules and variation, "headshots" (balls thrown in dodgeball that hit an opposing player in the head) may either result in the thrower being out, or the person being hit being out, or both.

If a player catches a ball thrown by the opposing team on the full, then the player who threw the ball is eliminated. As long as the ball has been caught in any way and is held for at least two seconds, the thrower is out (i.e. even if the ball is caught between the legs, the thrower is still out). If a dodgeball hits an opposing player but gets caught by one of the hit player's teammates, the thrower is out, a player gets reinstated, and the player who was hit stays in. In dodgeball games that are played on a basketball court, if a player throws the ball and it goes into the opposing basket and/or it hits the basketball backboard on the full, the whole team gets resurrected. The ball is still counted to have scored a basket or hit the backboard on the full if it rebounded off another dodgeball or it was deflected into the backboard by an opposing player. If the ball hits the backboard supports and/or the ring but fails to hit the backboard or go into the hoop, there is no effect. Players cannot be caught out if the ball hits the backboard, backboard supports, and/or the ring.

Players can pick up dead balls and throw them back at the other team; as such, a thrower may delay throwing a ball to avoid giving the opposing team something to hit him with. Players are allowed to leave the confines of the court to gather balls that have rolled out of bounds, but cannot throw the ball until they are back inside the court. A ball thrown from outside the court cannot eliminate an opponent who is hit. It only succeeds in getting the thrower automatically eliminated.  A player who moves completely out of bounds when a ball is thrown at them and does not catch that ball is also eliminated. If a player moves into the opponent's zone or picks up a ball from inside the opponent's zone without it fully rolling inside their zone, that player is out. Players can also get eliminated if their throw hits an opponent on the head, displays bad sportsmanship, or cheats. Kicking the balls is prohibited.

Depending on the rules of a particular game, a ball in the possession of a player can be used to block incoming balls thrown by the opposing team. Depending on the rules of the game being played, if a player gets a dodgeball knocked out of their hands from an opposition throw, or drops the dodgeball when it is used  to deflect oncoming balls, the player is eliminated.

Once all players on either team are eliminated, the game is over.

'''This will be in effect when there is a few players on each team:
Alternate rule is ‘No Lines’ or open court. This rule is used at a point in the game when there are few players left and it is too easy to dodge the ball with all the extra room. When ‘No Lines’ is declared, all boundary lines no longer count and the players can go anywhere to get a better shot at their opponent.'''

Players that are slight in stature have a definite advantage over larger more built players due to their light weight and ability to dart about the court. As such, players of this type are referred to as "skinny men".

==In popular culture==
In Spain, there is a variation of the game which is called Datchball. This game was created by Roberto Navarro, a Physical Education teacher, in order to include the game in the school. Nowadays it is one of the most important games{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} played by the students in the north of Spain and we can find associations, championships and leagues of the game.
* In the [[Indian subcontinent]] a variation of the game is played called "Sekan-tadi" (सेकन-तड़ी). This is slang used for "slamming the hip". Other names are Gend Tadi and Maram Pitti.
* In China, a variation of the game is played called "Da Yi Mao" (打一毛). Instead of a ball, the game is played with a small round sand bag, which is also known as the kick-ball (毽). There are multiple techniques of throwing the sand bag, making it hitting the target more efficiently and harder to catch. This sport is very popular among primary school students as an after-class activity. 
* The 2004 movie ''[[Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story]]'' is generally credited with reviving interest in the sport, especially among young adults, despite referencing the sport as being about "violence, exclusion and degradation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=All Grown Up, Dodgeball Hurtles Toward a Higher Popularity |first=Amit |last=Paley |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43151-2004Jul11.html |work=The Washington Post |date=July 12, 2004 |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also in 2004, [[Extreme Dodgeball]], a dodgeball tournament broadcast as a game show, aired
* The videogame ''[[Stikbold: A Dodgeball Adventure]]'' (named after the Danish word for dodgeball, stikbold) features the sport of dodgeball, although the rules vary slightly from the actual game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.windowscentral.com/stikbold-dodgeball-adventure-review&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the dangerous nature and associated risks of dodgeball have resulted in controversies, lawsuits, and calls to eliminate the game from school physical education programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=School dodgeball goes to court in New York |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-11-20-dodgeball_x.htm |work=The Associated Press |publisher=USAToday.com |date=November 20, 2004 |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World records==
* [[University of California, Irvine]], reclaimed the largest game of dodgeball title on Sept. 25, 2012 with 6,084 participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2012/09/25/uc-irvine-students-claim-record-for-worlds-biggest-dodgeball-game/ CBS]&lt;/ref&gt; The previous largest game of dodgeball was played by 4,979 participants at the [[University of Alberta]] on February 3, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U of A smashes dodgeball record |url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/sports/smashs+dodgeball+record/6098140/story.html |work=Edmonton Journal |date=February 3, 2012 |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The longest game of dodgeball was played on April 27–29, 2012 at the [[Castleton State College]] in [[Castleton, Vermont]]. The game lasted for 41 hr 3 min 17 sec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/longest-marathon-playing-dodgeball/ |title=Longest marathon playing dodgeball |work=Guinness World Records |accessdate=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
{{main|List of dodgeball variations}}

==Usage in American vernacular==
In some American idioms, the act of avoiding something or someone mildly unpleasant can be referred to as 'playing dodgeball.' Additionally, in a variant of the same concept, the term "dodgeball" is sometimes used to describe a situation in which an individual is caught between two untenable positions, in a reference to the version of the game in which players from the same team can surround opposing players from two opposite sides.

The '''Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) Council''' is a national government agency in the [[Philippines]] first tasked as a coordinating body on [[early childhood education]] by virtue of Republic Act 8980 of 2000, and officially established as a Council in 2009 through Executive Order No. 778. In 2013, R.A. 10410 or the “Early Years Act of 2013” also known as the EYA Law was enacted. This is “An Act Recognizing The Age From Zero (0) To Eight (8) Years As The First Crucial Stage Of Educational Development And Strengthening The Early Childhood Care And Development System (ECCD System) Appropriating Funds Therefor and For Other Purposes.” [[PAGCOR]] funds majority of the Council’s programs.

Guided by the responsibilities specified in the EYA Law, the Council focuses on the establishment of the national ECCD system that shall ensure the implementation of quality ECCD programs. The ECCD system has four major components, namely: ECCD curriculum; parent education and involvement, advocacy and mobilization of communities; human resource development, and ECCD management.  The Council is tasked to: establish national ECCD standards, develop policies and programs, ensure compliance thereof, and provide technical assistance as well as program support to ECCD service providers.

Of paramount importance is the partnership that the Council has developed since 2014 with local government units, especially in the establishment of National Child Development Centers (NCDCs). The Council provides funds for the construction of the NCDC and teaching-learning resources. For its part, the local government provides the required land area and its development, the perimeter fence and playground structures including the salary of the Child Development Teacher (CDT) from the second year of its operation.

The Council consists of a Governing Board and a Council Secretariat. The member agencies of the Council are also its core partners, namely: the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]], [[Department of Social Welfare and Development]] (DSWD), [[Health department|Department of Health]] (DOH), [[National Nutrition Council (Philippines)|National Nutrition Council]] (NNC), the [[Union of Local Authorities of the Philippines]] (ULAP) and a private ECCD practitioner.

'''Education in Angola''' has four years of compulsory, free primary education which begins at age seven, and secondary education which begins at age eleven, lasting eight years. Basic adult literacy continues to be extremely low, but there are conflicting figures from government and other sources. It is difficult to assess literacy and education needs. Statistics available in 2001 from UNICEF estimated adult literacy to be 56 percent for males and 29 percent for women. On the other hand, the university system has been developing considerably over the last decade.

==History==
{{main|History of education in Angola}}
African access to educational opportunities was highly limited for most of the [[Colonial history of Angola|colonial period]]. Many rural Angolan populations of the vast countryside retained their native culture and language and were not able to speak or understand [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref name=cbi&gt;Warner, Rachel. "Conditions before Independence". ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/aotoc.html A Country Study: Angola]'' (Thomas Collelo, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (February 1989). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mainland Portugal]], the homeland of the colonial authorities who ruled Angola from the 16th century until 1975, by the end of the 19th century the illiteracy rates were at over 80 percent and higher education was reserved for a small percentage of the population as well. 68.1 percent of [[mainland Portugal]]'s population was still classified as illiterate by the 1930 census. Mainland Portugal's literacy rate by the 1940s and early 1950s was low for [[North America]]n and [[Western Europe]]an standards at the time. Only in the mid-1960s did the country make public education available for all children between the ages of six and twelve, and the overseas territories profited from this new education developments and change in policy at [[Lisbon]]. 

In Angola, until the 1950s, facilities run by the government were few for such a large territory and restricted to the urban areas.&lt;ref name=cbi/&gt; Responsibility for educating Africans rested with [[Roman Catholicism in Angola|Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestantism in Angola|Protestant]] missions.&lt;ref name=cbi/&gt; As a consequence, each of the missions established its own [[school]] system, and the children were educated in Portuguese language and culture. This centuries-long [[missionary]] educational endeavor in [[Portuguese Angola]] was subject to [[Portugal|Portuguese]] coordination with pedagogical and organizational matters.&lt;ref name=cbi/&gt; Education beyond the [[primary education|primary]] level was available to very few black Africans before 1960, and the proportion of the age group that went on to [[secondary school]] in the early 1970s was quite low compared to the white Angolans (as well as comparing urban versus rural Angolans of all ethnicities).&lt;ref name=cbi/&gt; Nevertheless, primary school attendance was growing substantially.&lt;ref name=cbi/&gt; 

In general, the quality of teaching at the primary level was reasonable, despite the fact that sometimes instruction was carried on largely by Africans with very few qualifications.&lt;ref name=cbi/&gt; Most secondary school teachers were Portuguese.&lt;ref name=cbi/&gt; In 1962, the first [[university]] established in Angola was founded by the Portuguese authorities — [[Estudos Gerais Universitários de Angola]]. This first Angolan university awarded a range of degrees from [[engineering]] to [[medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/athens/troy/4285/ensino52.html&amp;date=2009-10-24+21:17:49 52. UNIVERSIDADE DE LUANDA]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, it was renamed ''Universidade de Luanda'' (“University of Luanda”).

The conflict between the Portuguese military and the nationalist guerrillas, the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–1974), did not damage effectively this strong education growth started in the late 1950s. However, the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002) that ensued after [[Angolan War of Independence|independence]] left the education system in chaos and the progress achieved in the last two decades was seriously damaged.&lt;ref name=cai/&gt; With the independence and the eruption of the civil war, most Portuguese had left (including virtually all secondary school staff), many buildings had been damaged, and availability of instructional materials was limited.&lt;ref name=cai&gt;Warner, Rachel. "Conditions after Independence". ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/aotoc.html A Country Study: Angola]'' (Thomas Collelo, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (February 1989).

A report of the First Party Congress published in December 1977 gave education high priority.&lt;ref name=cai/&gt; The government estimated the level of [[illiteracy]] following independence at between 85 percent and 90 percent and set the elimination of illiteracy as an immediate task.&lt;ref name=cai/&gt; By 1985, after a major literacy campaign, the average rate of adult literacy was officially estimated at 59 percent; [[United States]] government sources, however, estimated literacy at only 20 percent.&lt;ref name=cai/&gt; At independence there were 25,000 primary school [[teacher]]s, but fewer than 2,000 were even minimally qualified to teach primary school children.&lt;ref name=cai/&gt; The shortage of qualified instructors was more pronounced at the [[secondary school]] level, where there were only 600 teachers.&lt;ref name=cai/&gt; Furthermore, secondary schools existed only in [[List of cities and towns in Angola|towns]].&lt;ref name=cai/&gt; The First Party Congress responded to this problem by resolving to institute an eight-year [[compulsory education|compulsory]] system of [[free education|free]], basic education for children between ages seven and fifteen.&lt;ref name=cai/&gt;

School enrollment, which rose very slowly considering Angola's youthful population, reflected the dire effects of the insurgency. In 1977 the government reported that more than 1 million primary school students were enrolled, as were about 105,000 secondary school students, roughly double the numbers enrolled in 1973. What proportions of the relevant age groups these students constituted was not known. In the case of the primary school students, it may have been almost two-thirds; in that of secondary school students, it was perhaps a tenth to an eighth. Official government statistics released in 1984 showed that primary school enrollment had declined to 870,410, while secondary school enrollment (including vocational school and teacher training students) had increased to 151,759. This made for combined primary and secondary school enrollment consisting of 49 percent of the school-age population. By 1986 the primary school enrollment had increased to 1,304,145. 

After the independence of Angola from Portugal in 1975, the Portuguese-built University of Luanda was refounded as the Universidade de Angola (University of Angola) in 1979 as a successor of the higher education institutions created during the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonial administration. This included other institutions like the faculty of agricultural sciences based in the central Angolan town of [[Huambo]] which was known before independence by its many educational facilities, especially the Portuguese-founded Agricultural Research Institute that currently belongs to the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences of the Agostinho Neto University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/site/c.gjJTJbMUIuE/b.1352353/k.C301/Africa_University_partners_with_Chevron_Angolan_university.htm|title=The United Methodist Church|last=Communications|first=United Methodist|website=The United Methodist Church|language=en|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Luanda, founded in 1962, became known by its current title in 1985 to honor the first president of Angola, [[Agostinho Neto]]. In 1984, Luanda's [[Agostinho Neto University]], the country's only university, had an enrolment of 4,493 students. This number had declined to 3,195 by 1986. A total of 72,330 people were enrolled in primary adult education programs in 1986.

The government began implementation of its education plan in close cooperation with its [[foreign relations of Angola|allies]], particularly [[Cuba]] and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=cai/&gt; Hundreds of Cuban and Soviet teachers traveled to Angola to teach, and about 5,000 Angolan students studied in Cuba or the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=cai/&gt; Despite the government's efforts, the [[UNITA]] insurgency prevented the construction of a new education system on the remains of that inherited from the Portuguese.&lt;ref name=cai/&gt; Between 1977 and the mid-1980s, school enrolment declined, reflecting the dire effects of the insurgency.&lt;ref name=cai/&gt; The demands of the war had drained funds that could otherwise have been applied to building schools, printing [[book]]s, and purchasing equipment.&lt;ref name=cai/&gt; Fighting also disrupted the education of hundreds of thousands of children.&lt;ref name=cai/&gt;

A number of Angolan organizations become active during the 1980s in the quest for better educational facilities.In 1987 the JMPLA launched a special campaign to recruit 1,000 young people to teach in primary schools in Luanda Province. The groups targeted by the campaign included secondary school and higher education graduates, as well as some workers. The OMA sponsored programs to teach women to read and write and was involved in programs to reduce infant mortality and promote family planning. Even the military formed a special group in 1980, the eighth contingent of the Comrade Dangereux Brigade, whose basic function was to teach primary school; 6,630 brigade members were reported to have taught 309,419 students by 1987. 

In 1988, according to the United States Center for Defense Information, the Angolan government spent more per capita on the military (US$892) than on education (US$310). The war in the southern and central regions of the country prevented the spread of the school system; the consequences of the fighting, including UNITA attacks on schools and teachers and the massive displacement of rural populations in those areas, disrupted the education of hundreds of thousands of children. Further damaging to Angola's future was the fact that many of those studying abroad had either failed to complete their courses of study or had not returned to Angola.

After independence from Portugal in 1975, Angolan students continued to be admitted to Portuguese high schools, polytechnical institutes and universities, through bilateral agreements between the Portuguese and the Angolan governments, most of them belong to the Angolan elites. However, many of those studying in European countries like [[Portugal]] and [[Russia]] failed to complete their courses of study or had not returned to Angola.

Release of UNICEF's 1999 annual report on ''The State of the World's Children'' predicted that illiteracy rates would escalate in the following century because one out of four children in the poorest nations would not be in school. By 1998, Angola alone had more than 50% of its children under age 12 who did not attend school.&lt;ref&gt;Brenda Wilkinson, [http://gbgm-umc.org/africa/angola/streetch.html Street Children of Angola], General Board of Global Ministries (December 22, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although by [[law]], education in [[Angola]] is compulsory and free for eight years, the government reports that a certain percent of students are not in school due to a lack of school buildings and teachers.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;"Botswana". [http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2005/tda2005.pdf ''2005 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109071239/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2005/tda2005.pdf |date=January 9, 2014 }}. [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]], [[U.S. Department of Labor]] (2006).

There continue to be significant disparities in enrolment between [[rural]] and [[urban area]]s. In 1995, 71.2 percent of children ages 7 to 14 years were attending school.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; It is reported that higher percentages of boys attend school than girls.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; During the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002), nearly half of all schools were reportedly [[Looting|loot]]ed and destroyed, leading to problems with overcrowding.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; The Ministry of Education hired 20,000 new teachers in 2005, and continued to implement teacher training.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Teachers tend to be underpaid, inadequately trained, and overworked (sometimes teaching two or three [[Shift work|shift]]s a day).&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Teachers reportedly demanded payment or [[bribe]]s directly from their students.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Other factors, such as the presence of [[landmines]], lack of resources and identity papers, and poor health prevent children from regularly attending school.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Although budgetary allocations for education were increased in 2004, the education system in Angola continues to be extremely under-funded.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;

[[Literacy]] is quite low, with 67.4% of the population over the age of 15 able to read and write in Portuguese.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} 82.9% of males and 54.2% of women are literate as of 2001.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In Angola in 1999-2000, the gross primary enrollment rate was approximately 74 percent and the net primary enrolment rate was approximately 30 percent.&lt;ref name=combating&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/_sec/regs/fedreg/notices/2005010620.htm "Combating Exploitive Child Labour Through Education in Angola"]. [[U.S. Department of Labor]] (May 27, 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; In provinces hardest hit by the war, gross enrolment rates averaged less than 40 percent.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt; In 2002, 26 percent of children who were enrolled in primary school reached grade 4. Rates of enrolment, retention, and completion in Angola tend to be lower among girls.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt;

When the civil war ended in 2002, Angola's education infrastructure was in disarray. Several programs started after the end of the civil war were expected to improve education in Angola.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt; In 2004, the government concluded its national child registration campaign, which documented 3.8 million children under the age of 18 years since August 2002.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt; [[UNICEF]] and the [[Government of Angola]] expanded their existing Back-to-School campaign by recruiting and training 29,000 new primary school teachers for the 2004 school year.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt; As a result, student enrollment has increased by nearly 1 million, primarily in grades 1 through 4.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt; The program is developing into an Education for All Program.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt; In April 2004, the Ministry of Education held public consultations on the proposed National Plan of Action for Education for All.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt;

Many areas of rapid resettlement, areas hardest hit by the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002), and remote rural areas continue to lack basic social services, including education.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt; This absence of services has led to an increased migration to municipal and provincial capitals, where basic services and schools are operating beyond capacity.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt; Although primary school construction has received significant support from [[Donation|donor]]s, many of these newly constructed schools lack qualified teachers, [[Curriculum|curricula]], staff, and much-needed resources and support.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt; Viable non-formal education, accelerated education, [[vocation]]al training, and other alternative education opportunities are scarce, and lack qualified teachers, staff, resources and support.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt;

Years of conflict have left many students, including former [[child soldier]]s, severely traumatized and [[Physical disability|physically disabled]].&lt;ref name=combating/&gt; Abuse experienced by many abducted and war-affected girls has left them especially vulnerable and some with young children requiring care during school hours.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt; During the conflict, many students missed years of schooling, resulting in classrooms populated by many overage students.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt; For these young people, the services that are available to them are often inadequate to meet their special needs.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt;

Some teacher training and community programs have included special training for adults working with former child soldiers, war-affected children, and children engaged in or at risk of engaging in the worst forms of [[child labour]].&lt;ref name=combating/&gt; Some social protection and education programs, curricula, policies, and resources have been revised and made more suitable for this population.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt; However, there continues to be a need for more relevant and adequate teaching techniques; resources, curricula, and teaching tools; formal, vocational, and alternative educational programs; life skills training; social services; community support; education and social policies and programs; and opportunities for young people to develop into productive and responsible citizens.&lt;ref name=combating/&gt;

==Current status of primary education ==
After the end of the [[Angolan Civil War]] in 2002, and with the oil price increases in the late 2000s, the [[Angolan Government]] was able to collect huge financial resources from taxes on oil and diamond extraction profits. This increase of the governmental budget plus the end of the armed conflict allowed a new opportunity to expand and improve Angola's education system. Angola's Education Ministry requested the implementation of the "Cuban system" (a [[Cuba]]n teaching method) beginning in March 2009 in the provinces of Luanda, Benguela, Huambo and Bié, to be afterward extended to other areas of the nation. The method will be first implemented on February in Luanda, as an experimental project, for which a group of 10 teachers from Cuba will travel to the African nation in the first months of 2009. The Angolan leaders were looking to eliminate widespread illiteracy before 2014 or at least reduce it to a minimal extent by that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.periodico26.cu/english/education/nov_dec2008/angola-literacy121808.html Angola Will Use Cuban Teaching Method in Literacy Campaign]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Higher education ==

Immediately after independence, the colonial Universidade de Luanda was renamed Universidade de Angola, and in 1979 Universidade Agostinho Neto (UAN). In 1998 the Catholic Church founded, also in Luanda, the Universidade Católica de Angola (UCAN). Over the years, the UAN came to consist of about 40 faculties dispersed over most of the territory. In the wake of political liberalization, private universities began to spring up in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt; See Paulo de Carvalho, Víctor Kajibanga, Franz-Wilhelm Heimer, “Angola”, in: D. Teferra &amp; P. Altbach (eds.), ''African Higher Education: An International Reference Handbook'', Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2003, pp. 162-175&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were linked to universities in Portugal — Universidade Lusíada, Universidade Lusófona and Universidade Jean Piaget — all of them in Luanda. Others were endogenous initiatives: Universidade Privada de Angola (Luanda and Lubango), Universidade Técnica de Angola (Luanda), Universidade Metodista (Luanda), Universidade Metropolitana (Luanda) and Instituto Superior de Ciências Sociais e Relações Internacionais (Luanda). The creation of an Islamic university in Luanda was announced by Saudi Arabia. In 2009, the UAN split up: while it still exists under the same name in Luanda and Bengo province, the faculties in [[Benguela]], [[Cabinda city|Cabinda]], [[Huambo]], [[Lubango]], [[Malanje]] and [[Uíge]] now constitute autonomous public universities.

'''Education in Liberia''' was severely affected by the [[First Liberian Civil War]] and [[Second Liberian Civil War]], between 1989 and 2003. In 2010, the literacy rate of [[Liberia]] was estimated at 60.8% (64.80% for males and 56.8% for females).
[[File: Aid to Basic Education, the amount of bilateral and multilateral aid contributed or received by Liberia.png|thumb|Aid to Basic Education, the amount of bilateral and multilateral aid contributed or received by Liberia (source: UNESCO)]]
Education in Liberia is free for primary students attending a government school, but most of these schools lack adequate learning facilities. Most Parents preferred sending their kids to private schools which are often very expensive for the average Liberian. 
 On average, children attain 10 years of education (11 for boys and 8 for girls). Liberia's education sector is hampered by inadequate schools and supplies, as well as a lack of qualified teachers and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.cfr.org/development-channel/2012/08/20/emerging-voices-glencorse-on-higher-education-in-liberia/ "Emerging Voices: Glencorse on Higher Education in Liberia", [[Council on Foreign Relations]], August 20, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary education==
{{see also|List of schools in Liberia}}
The Liberia Primary School Certificate Examination is coordinated in government-funded schools (and many private schools) by the [[West African Examinations Council]].

==Secondary education==
{{see also|List of schools in Liberia}}
[[Secondary school]] examinations in government-funded schools (and many private schools) are coordinated by the [[West African Examinations Council]]. These are the Liberia Junior High School Certificate Examination, the Liberia Senior High School Certificate Examination and the [[West African Senior School Certificate Examination]].

==Higher education==
{{see also|List of universities in Liberia}}
Historically, from 1862 to the outbreak of the war in the 1980s, [[higher education]] in the country centered on:

* Liberia College, the precursor to the [[University of Liberia]] 
* Cuttington Collegiate College, the precursor to [[Cuttington University|Cuttington University College]]
* Harper Technical College (founded in 1971), renamed William V. S. Tubman College of Technology in 1978, now known as [[Tubman University]].

Currently [[higher education]] in Liberia is decentralized.

Higher education is provided by a number of public and private universities. The [[University of Liberia]] is the country's largest and oldest university. Located in Monrovia, the university opened in 1862 and today has six colleges, including a medical school and the nation's only law school, the [[Louis Arthur Grimes School of Law]].

In 2009, [[Tubman University]] in [[Harper, Liberia|Harper]], [[Maryland County]] became the second public university in Liberia. Cuttington University, established by the Episcopal Church of the USA in 1889 in Suakoko, Bong County, is the nation's oldest private university. Since 2006, the government has also opened community colleges in Buchanan, Sanniquellie, Voinjama, and many other County headquarters.

In addition to the above-named colleges, there also exist:

* [[African Methodist Episcopal University]]
* Don Bosco Technical College
* [[United Methodist University]] (UMU)
* African Methodist Episcopal Zion University (AMEZU)
* African Bible College University (ABCU)

These universities are greatly contributing to the higher education needs in Liberia. They have produced students that are working with international organizations such as the UN, international banking institutions, government and other local institutions. Some are pursuing graduate degrees abroad due to limited graduate programs in the country. For example, while there is an undergraduate program in sociology at all of these universities, there is no graduate program for students wanting to pursue a graduate degree in sociology.

The following are disciplines in which undergraduate degrees are being offered: Sociology, geology, political science, history, biology, chemistry, economics. accounting, management, education, journalism, civil engineering, physics, mathematics, English, geography, social work, nursing, architectural engineering, rural development, laboratory technology, theology, general science, and agriculture. Some of these disciplines are only being offered at a single university. For example, Social Work is only being offered as a degree at the United Methodist University (UMU) and Mother Patern College of Health Sciences, which falls under Don Bosco Polytechnic.

The University of Liberia offers graduate degrees in education, regional planning, international relations and public administration, while Cuttington University is offering graduate degrees in education, Public Health, Business administration, Management, Public administration, and nursing education. The additional colleges do not have no graduate programs.

Liberia has three public Rural Teacher Training Institutes in Webbo, Kakata, and Zorzor.

== Corruption within the education system ==

Pristina is known for its many educational institutions such as the [[Universiteti i Prishtinës|University "Hasan Prishtina"]], the National Library of Kosovo, and the [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo]]. Throughout the last century Pristina has attracted a considerable number of students from Kosovo. Today, the city of Pristina hosts a considerable number of intellectuals, professors, academics, students, and professionals in various spheres.

== Education in Pristina in the Past ==

=== The Foundation of Educational Institutions in Pristina ===

Among the first schools known in Pristina were those opened during the Ottoman period—that is before 1912.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld"&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6a80c0.html "The History, Culture and Identity of Albanians in Kosovo"], Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, ''The History, Culture and Identity of Albanians in Kosovo'', 1 May 1997,accessed 23 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Albanians were allowed to attend these schools, most of which were religious, with only few of them being secular.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; During 1913, in Pristina, few Serbian-language primary schools and gymnasiums were opened.&lt;ref name="see-educoop.net"&gt;[http://www.see-educoop.net/education_in/pdf/edu_kos_p0-108-yug-kos-aln-t01.pdf "Shifra dhe fakte per Arsimin e Kosoves"], KEC, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; The period that followed the Ottoman rule, between 1916 and 1918 was also important for the educational system in Kosovo. During this period, Pristina, along with other municipalities such as [[Ferizaj]] and [[Prizren]], was occupied by [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name="see-educoop.net"/&gt;  Bulgarian occupier did not allow Albanian-language schools, however because of the positive impact of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarians]] in the Bulgarian area, some religious catholic schools were allowed in Pristina and other municipalities occupied by them.&lt;ref name="see-educoop.net"/&gt; In 1916, the Bulgarian National Gymnasium was opened in Pristina.&lt;ref name="see-educoop.net"/&gt; The situation in terms of education was worse in the region under the rule of Bulgaria compared to the region occupied by Austro-Hungarian forces where 300 Albanian-language schools were allowed to be opened.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt;

=== Education during the period under Yugoslavia and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ===
During 1919-1939 in [[Yugoslavia]], all Albanian-language schools were closed and education was allowed only in [[Serbo-Croatian]].&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; Around four (4) percent of Yugoslav people attended secondary education, with rural areas being the regions with the lowest numbers of participants since access to schools was almost nonexistent.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; During this period, the most marginalized group who was deprived from attending schools were girls coming from Muslim families.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; 
 
During the [[World War II]] Kosovo joined with [[Albania]] under Italian occupation.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; This marked a positive turn in the educational system in Kosovo and Prishtina/Pristina in particular since schools in [[Albanian language]] were allowed to be opened.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; Besides hundreds of primary schools opened in Pristina, the first high school in the Albanian language in this municipality, Sami Frasheri, was also founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.see-educoop.net/education_in/pdf/edu_kos_p0-108-yug-kos-aln-t01.pdf "Shifra dhe fakte per Arsimin e Kosoves"], KEC, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[World War II]], [[Kosovo]] was again part of [[Yugoslavia]]. During this period, ethnic Albanians were recognized as a national minority and [[Albanian language]] was accepted and Albanian-language primary schools were allowed while higher levels of education were offered still only in [[Serbo-Croatian]].&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; In 1968, the constitution was amended to allow the opening of Albanian-language schools at all levels.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt;
After the [[World War II|WWII]], education in [[Kosovo]] was provided in three languages: [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]],&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; while after 1953 lessons in these three languages were offered in the same school.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt;
 
After 1968, the foundation of Albanian-language educational institutions continued.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; In 1969, [[University of Pristina (1969–1999)|the Albanian University of Pristina]] was opened.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; Texts and teaching materials were imported from Albania, as part of an agreement between the [[University of Tirana]] and that of [[University of Pristina (1969–1999)|Pristina]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; 
In 1981, the University of Pristina consisted of 75 per cent ethnic Albanians out of the 47,000 students attending it.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt;  During the late 70s and early 80s the economic situation in Kosovo and Yugoslavia was worsening. Furthermore, negative discrimination of students based on ethnicity led Albanian students of the University of Pristina to organize a massive protest on March 11, 1981, known as the [[1981 protests in Kosovo|Student Protests of 1981]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.see-educoop.net/education_in/pdf/edu_kos_p0-108-yug-kos-aln-t01.pdf "Shifra dhe fakte per Arsimin e Kosoves"], KEC, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of violent student riots, restrictions in the education of Albanians were imposed again.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; As a result of this protest, the previous agreement between Albania and Kosovo, to exchange educational materials, ended and [[Serbo-Croatian]] books started to be translated in Albanian to fulfil the needs of the university.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; Further, students, teachers and professors who participated in these protests were expelled, thus resulting in more than 260 students and more than 210 teachers/professors expelled.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt;

=== The context during the period under Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro ===
{{see also|Milosevic and the educational system in Kosovo}}
During the period of abolition of Kosovo's autonomy (1989-1990), education in Kosovo faced further changes.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt;  A new curriculum concentrated more in covering Serbian culture and history and that made [[Serbo-Croatian]] a compulsory subject in Kosovo high schools was adopted in 1990.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; Further, students who wanted to enter secondary schools had to pass a [[Serbian language]] test.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; As a result, after 1992, there were left only Albanian-language elementary schools while in secondary schools and [[Universiteti i Prishtinës|Pristina University]] Serbian was the only language of instruction.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt;

==== Private Albanian schools ====

In the 1990s, [[Albanians in Kosovo|Kosovars]] established a parallel education system as a temporary solution to the situation created during that period.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; Around 300-450,000 students boycotted the state educational institutions and attended the parallel Albanian-language private schools.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; For a period of more than six years, [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanian-Kosovar]] students attended parallel primary and secondary schools and were unable to attend University as they were neither allowed to enter nor attend the University or Pristina.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; These private/parallel schools were located in mosques, private houses, garages, etc.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt;

On September 1, 1996, President of Serbia, [[Slobodan Milošević|Milošević]] and Kosovar leader, [[Ibrahim Rugova|Rugova]]  signed an agreement that would allow ethnic Albanian students and teachers to return to schools.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; However, this agreement was never implemented and this led to protest held between October 1997 and January 1998.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; Again, during these protests a number of the students were arrested and beaten by the police. On March 23, 1998, another agreement was signed that allowed Albanian students to return to schools and in the University of Pristina.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; However, this agreement did not allow the integration of Albanian students and pupils with the Serbian ones. To maintain this, a shift schedule was applied so that Serb students attended the lectures in the morning and Albanians in the afternoon.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt; In response to this agreement and as a way to show their disagreement, Serb students and professors at the University of Pristina organized a protest where 10,000 people were gathered.&lt;ref name="history-culture-refworld" /&gt;

=== The Context during the period and after the ethnic-conflict in 1998-1999 ===

After the conflict, United Mission in Kosovo started working in establishing educational institutions. UNMIK authorities tried to establish schools that would work in a unified system and students be taught in their language of choice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/iiep/PDF/pubs/kosovo.pdf "Parallel worlds – Rebuilding the education system in Kosovo"], IIEP, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the first changes to be adopted in 2001 were the new curriculum framework and changes in the organization of educational system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingscotland.org.uk/global-education/international-dimension/exclusive-kosovo-rebuilding-the-education-system-after-civil-conflict.aspx "Kosovo – Rebuilding the education system after civil conflict "], Amanda Crawford, accessed on 23 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; During the time that UNMIK authorities were trying to set up education authorities and institutions in Pristina, Serbian and Albanian education officials restarted schools in this city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/iiep/PDF/pubs/kosovo.pdf "Parallel worlds – Rebuilding the education system in Kosovo"], IIEP, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

One factor that had an impact in the education policy-making in Kosovo during that time was the increasing urbanization. According to some estimates, the number of people living in Pristina tripled in size since before the NATO campaign from around 200,000 residents before the conflict to about 650,000 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/iiep/PDF/pubs/kosovo.pdf "Parallel worlds – Rebuilding the education system in Kosovo"], IIEP, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007-2008, in Pristina, eleven schools (11) were operating in two (2) shifts while one school was operating in fours (4) shifts, due to the high number of pupils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/documents/Raporti%20statistikor_shqip.pdf "Treguesit dhe të dhënat statistikore në arsim 2004/05, 05/06, 06/07"], MEST, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other problems that existed during that time in Pristina related to education, were the high drop-out rates between primary and secondary school for girls, ethnic minorities and children in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/iiep/PDF/pubs/kosovo.pdf "Parallel worlds – Rebuilding the education system in Kosovo"], IIEP, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in relation to teacher and professor, the major problem was regarding their salaries. At that time, salaries for faculty at the main campus in Pristina were quite low. Few of the professors were paid salaries that were little more than US $100 per month.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/iiep/PDF/pubs/kosovo.pdf "Parallel worlds – Rebuilding the education system in Kosovo"], IIEP, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the major actions, during what was known as the emergent phase (1999-2002), that the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) took were to reactivate the educational system in Kosovo especially by contributing in improving and building new school infrastructure, accommodating all the students in schools, and formulating and implementing laws and regulations to ensure the proper functioning of the educational system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/documents/Raporti%20statistikor_shqip.pdf "Treguesit dhe të dhënat statistikore në arsim 2004/05, 05/06, 06/07"], MEST, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, MEST formulated a new structure of organizing the educational institutions. From now on the education system would consist of preschool education (from 9 months to six years), compulsory education that consists of 5 years of primary education, 4 years of lower secondary education, and 3 or 4 years of upper secondary education depending on the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/documents/Pasqyre_e_Statistikave_te_Arsimit_ne_Kosove.pdf "Pasqyrë e Statistikave të Arsimit në Kosovë 2004/05"], MEST, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this organization, as of 2004/2005, in Pristina were only 3 preschool institutions and had 1542 children out of which only five (5) were Bosnian, two (2) Croatian, eight (8) Turkish,  two (2) Gorani and four (4) other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/documents/Pasqyre_e_Statistikave_te_Arsimit_ne_Kosove.pdf "Pasqyrë e Statistikave të Arsimit në Kosovë 2004/05"], MEST, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, as of 2007/08, the number of preschool institutions in Pristina increased from 3 to 9 while the number of ethnic minorities attending these institutions decreased in 5, with only two (2) Bosnians and three (3) Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/documents/Statistikat_e_Arsimit_ne_Kosove_2007-08_548484.pdf "Statistikat e Arsimit në Kosovë 2007–08"], MEST, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary and lower-secondary education was based on the 5 + 4 years model since the academic year 2004/05.&lt;ref name="masht-gov.net"&gt;[http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/documents/Pasqyre_e_Statistikave_te_Arsimit_ne_Kosove.pdf "Pasqyrë e Statistikave të Arsimit në Kosovë 2004/05"], MEST, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; In Pristina, in the same academic year, there were 60 primary and lower-secondary schools that provide instruction only in the Albanian language.&lt;ref name="masht-gov.net"/&gt; The total number of students was 32,370 out of which 15,583 were females and all of them were Albanian students.The average number of students per class in that academic year in Pristina was 26.71.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/documents/Pasqyre_e_Statistikave_te_Arsimit_ne_Kosove.pdf "Pasqyrë e Statistikave të Arsimit në Kosovë 2004/05"], MEST, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; In the academic year 2005/06 the number of primary and lower-secondary schools increased in 63 and two (2) schools would now offer instruction in other languages as well; however, in 2007/08, this number again decreased in 61 schools with only one of them having mixed languages of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/documents/Statistikat_e_Arsimit_ne_Kosove_2007-08_548484.pdf "Statistikat e Arsimit në Kosovë 2007–08"], MEST, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; These schools were attended by 34,703 Albanian, 32 Bosnian students, 30 Ashkali, 1 Roma and 199 Turkish students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/documents/Statistikat_e_Arsimit_ne_Kosove_2007-08_548484.pdf "Statistikat e Arsimit në Kosovë 2007–08"], MEST, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Private school "Mileniumi i Trete".JPG|thumb|Private school "Mileniumi i Trete"]]Since the 2002/03 academic year, upper-secondary education consisted of three (3) or four (4) years, depending on the academic programs set by MEST.&lt;ref name="Pasqyre_e_Statistikave_te_Arsimit_ne_Kosove p.24"&gt;[http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/documents/Pasqyre_e_Statistikave_te_Arsimit_ne_Kosove.pdf "Pasqyrë e Statistikave të Arsimit në Kosovë 2004/05"], MEST, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; In the academic year 2004/05, there were 12 schools in Pristina that offered lectures only in Albanian language.&lt;ref name="Pasqyre_e_Statistikave_te_Arsimit_ne_Kosove p.24"/&gt; Total number of students in this year was 9060 out of which 4423 were, and the average number of students per class was 30.10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/documents/Pasqyre_e_Statistikave_te_Arsimit_ne_Kosove.pdf "Pasqyrë e Statistikave të Arsimit në Kosovë 2004/05"], MEST, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; In the academic year 2005/06, two (2) schools out of the total number of 12 became mixed schools adopting other languages of instruction besides Albanian, with one of them being Sami Frasheri.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/documents/Statistikat_e_Arsimit_ne_Kosove0506.pdf "Statistikat e Arsimit në Kosovë 2005–06"], MEST, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to Special Education Institutions, during the period after the conflict and prior to the Independence of Kosovo, there was only one school in Pristina, "Perparimi."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/documents/Pasqyre_e_Statistikave_te_Arsimit_ne_Kosove.pdf "Pasqyrë e Statistikave të Arsimit në Kosovë 2004/05"], MEST, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in the academic year 2004/05 there were a total of 7 private schools: 1 preschool, 3 primary schools, and 3 high schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/documents/Pasqyre_e_Statistikave_te_Arsimit_ne_Kosove.pdf "Pasqyrë e Statistikave të Arsimit në Kosovë 2004/05"], MEST, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; University of Pristina during this period was highly decentralized. It had fourteen faculties and six higher schools. As of 2001, there were more than 19,000 students enrolled.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt;

=== The context during after Kosovo's Declaration of Independence ===

==== Regulating Authority ====

After the declaration of Independence, decision-making institutions continued in formulating and adopting education related policies, laws and regulations. The educational competences of the municipality of Pristina are regulated with the Law No. 03/L-068 on Education in the Municipalities of the Republic of Kosovo. Article 4 foresees the exclusive powers of the municipalities as far as the local interest is concerned, while acting in accordance with the applicable legislation with respect to the provisions of public pre-primary, primary and secondary education. Some of the competences of the municipality of Pristina, and other municipalities, include registration and admission of students, license of all public educational institutions, employment of teachers and other school personnel, selection of the Director and/or Deputy Director of educational institutions, payment of the managerial staff as well as other employed personnel, training educators and other professional staff and supervision and inspection of the education process&lt;ref&gt;LAW NO. 03/L-068 ON EDUCATION IN THE MUNICIPALITIES OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO

.http://gazetazyrtare.rks-gov.net/Documents/anglisht-85.pdf 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, according to the Law on Local Self Government municipalities are entitled to cooperate with other municipalities and other authorities, including municipalities, institutions and government agencies in the Republic of Serbia, within the field of education.
&lt;ref&gt;LAW NR. 03/L-040 ON LOCAL SELF GOVERNMENT. http://gazetazyrtare.rks-gov.net/Documents/anglisht-76.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

As far higher education is concerned, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) have all the competences and responsibilities. It is foreseen with the Law on Education in the Municipalities of the Republic of Kosovo and the Law on Higher Education that the aforementioned Ministry is responsible for planning the development of higher education in Kosovo, regulating public and private providers of higher education, promoting equality of opportunity in access and admission to higher education, in staff development and training, establishing a State Council for Higher Education, which advises the Minister on higher education matters, licensing private providers of higher education, and other responsibilities as foreseen by the Law.&lt;ref&gt;LAW No.04/L-037 ON HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE REPUBLIC KOSOVO. http://gazetazyrtare.rks-gov.net/Documents/Ligji%20per%20arsimin%20e%20larte%20(anglisht).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary Situation of Education in Pristina ==

=== Education Sector in Pristina Today, the challenges it faces and the way forward ===
The Local Government Elections of 2013 produced a new leadership in the Municipality of Pristina. The new Mayor of Pristina, [[Shpend Ahmeti]] representing the '[[Vetëvendosje!|Vetevendosje]]' or self-determination movement highlighted that during his mandate the area of education is the main priority.&lt;ref name="perprishtinen.com"&gt;"Arsimi Ne Prishtine." Per Prishtinn. Vetvendosje, n.d. Web. 02 Mar. 2014. &lt;http://www.perprishtinen.com/programi/arsimi/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently in the city of Pristina there are only eight public preschools, in which 1,886 children attend education while overall there are 2,074 pupils aged 5–6 years attend pre-primary class in Pristina. 80 percent of children aged 0–6 years are outside the system. In fact, families who succeed to enrol their children in public kindergartens are very privileged because demand exceeds supply up to tenfold. Based on the Kosovo Agency of Statistics, during years 2011 and 2012 in Pristina there were 7,685 children born from mothers with permanent residence in Pristina.&lt;ref name="perprishtinen.com"/&gt;

==== Current issues affecting Education in Pristina are ====

* Child-Teacher Ratio — For 10-15 children aged 1–2 years there is only one teacher while  for children aged 2–3 years there is only one teacher for 15 or more children
* Lack of reading areas in most public kindergartens. These areas are essential reading for children's mental development
* Most public kindergartens do not have facilities for gymnastics or sports fields. While preschool institutions in addition to the role that they play in children's mental development, they have to care also for the physical development of children
* Pristina has 40 private kindergartens. The cost of sending ones child to a private kindergarten in relation to the living standards are quite high and mostly difficult to be affordable for most parents since this drains 80 to 100 euros, while the average income is 250-400 EUR. Moreover, a large number of these kindergartens work without a license and they often accept more children than their capacity can handle, resulting in low quality education but also increasing risks to children. While the licensing is a jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, the Pristina Municipality has failed to collect accurate data on how many of these kindergartens operate and how
The city of Pristina has 41 primary schools and lower secondary schools with 34,342 students (MED 2011-2012). Within the city there are 22 primary and secondary schools (including Jakova Prenk music school) and the major problems that need to be resolved are: 
* The large number of students in elementary and secondary schools. Resulting in a situation that affects the quality of education attained and student success. Besides the lack of school facilities, student enrolment is often done without certain criteria. There are cases when parents enrol their children in schools that are not in their neighbourhood but go after the best schools
Another problem highlighted is that high schools in Pristina are forced to accept students coming from other municipalities because of specific profiles that are missing in these municipalities - which has led to overloading of classes.&lt;ref name="perprishtinen.com"/&gt;

==== Latest Reforms ====

The first decision undertaken by the new leadership in the Municipality of Pristina, under Mayor Shpend Ahmeti was to increase transparency in the process of interviewing education personnel. The decision enables the participation of the parent council, student council, civil society, and media in interviewing candidates for the selection of educational staff.&lt;ref&gt;"Kuadrot Arsimore Të Prishtinës Intervistohen Publikisht."

==== Higher Education ====

===== Public Institution =====

[[File:University of Prishtina logo.svg|thumb|University of Pristina logo|191x191px]]The University of Pristina was inaugurated in 1970 and the courses were taught in two languages: Albanian and Serbian, which enabled Albanian students to study in their mother tongue for what was also the purpose of establishing a university in Kosovo.

Since establishment to 1996, there were 60,000 students who graduated from the University of Pristina from which 38 thousand did so in Albanian language.&lt;ref&gt;The State of Higher Education in Kosovo* by Elmar Pichl. http://cicic.ca/docs/en/app6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:University of Pristina - Faculty of Philosophy.JPG|thumb|University of Pristina - Faculty of Philosophy|323x323px]]The University of Pristina has the following departments:

Last year leadership bodies of the University of Pristina decided unanimously to change the name from the University of Pristina to that of University Hasan Prishtina, recognizing one the historical figure of Hasan Prishtina.&lt;ref&gt;VENDIMET E KSHC-SE PER VITIN 2013 (BPUAL &amp; BPRAL).http://www.akreditimi-ks.org/new/index.php/sq/documents-publications/official/cat_view/3-evaluations/53-ncq-decisions&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014 the rector of Kosovo's state university "Hasan Prishtina," Ibrahim Gashi, resigned following protests that took place in late January-early February by students when it was reported that some university professors had published works in fake online journals to gain academic credentials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/08/us-kosovo-university-idUSBREA170TO20140208]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Special Considerations to the Education System in Pristina ===

==== Students coming from majority vs non-majority communities ====
In the region of Prishtinë/Priština students from the Albanian, Bosniak, and Turk communities share the same classes or schools. While schools based on the Serbian curriculum, and in the context of the Pristina Municipality are located in the Municipality of Gračanica/Graçanicë and integrate students from the Serb and Roma communities

The Prishtinë/Priština University offers some Bosnian and Turkish language courses on Turkish philology (50 seats), Bosnian and Turkish language for teachers (35 seats each), information technology (in Bosnian, 35 seats) and business administration (in Bosnian, 80 seats).&lt;ref&gt;Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe MISSION IN KOSOVO.http://www.osce.org/kosovo/36978&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gender balance ====

==== Safety issues ====
[[File:Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo February 2013.jpg|thumb|Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo February 2013]]Many schools in the Pristina Municipality lack a safe and accessible environment for children due to  missing fire equipment, while some schools also lacking emergency exits, and students with disabilities not having easy access in schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8763">'''European Architecture Student Assembly''' was founded in 1981 by architect students like Geoff Haslam and [[Richard Murphy (architect)|Richard Murphy]] and is closely related to the Winterschool concept, which organises similar events for UK students of architecture.
'''EASA''' takes place each summer in a different country, with the event usually lasting two weeks. It is organised by students of architecture for students of architecture and the concept is operated on a cooperative basis. In fall at INCM, Intermediate National Contact Meeting, the location for EASA is decided one and a half years in advance. Typically 400 students take part in the event and engage in '''workshops''', '''exhibitions''', '''lectures''' and social events loosely based around a specific theme. These events are run by a combination of academics and students and encompass a wide variety of activities with a greater or lesser relationship to architecture. The event is funded through a combination of attendance fees (which vary for each country based upon ability to pay), grants and sponsorship, all arranged by the organising committee for each event.

'''EASA''' has little or no formal structure in that each event is organised as a unique occurrence- though a system of '''National Contacts''', '''NC's''', that ensures, that the event each year is well supported. NC's also typically meet once a year to discuss the previous '''EASA''' and prepare for the next. Students come from over 40 European countries to the event each year. Recent Assemblies have seen students participating from the USA, India and Central American countries.

===SESAM (Small European Architecture Students Assembly Meeting)===
The '''SESAM''' is an event arranged by the '''EASA''' network. Like the basic idea of the '''EASA''', a '''SESAM''' can give an addition and/or alternative to the education of the students. The independence and off-university-character creates an informal atmosphere. The '''SESAM''' is a '''workshop''' with a small number of participants. Through this concentrated character the '''SESAM''' allows to work on a tight theme. After a number of similar events in the year before in Italy, the [[Netherlands]], [[Czechoslovakia]], etc., the first '''EASA''' workshop with the name '''SESAM''' was realized 1992 in [[Villafames]]  (Valencia, Spain, October 1992, 50 participants). SESAM2007 was held in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]] on 23–25 November 2007.

===Pivo SESAM ===
The event is an excuse to meet with the other members of the network. It usually takes place during the New Year celebrations.

==EASA Newspaper: Umbrella==
Each year, during '''EASA''', one of the workshops is dedicated to cover the event by reporting about events and workshops in a newspaper-like fashion. This workshop and hence the newspaper is typically called umbrella, or variation of the local word for umbrella. This newspaper is usually published on a daily basis and has been an integral part of '''EASA''' since the early 1980s. In recent years, The Umbrella Workshop has also embraced new media, and has run EASA TV during the event. In 2009 EASA TV was a workshop of its own for the first time, but with integral co-operation with Umbrella.

==EASA TV==
EASA.TV tries to cover as much of the assembly as possible and the material is then edited, screened on site at the assembly and uploaded online. The participants will learn how to plan episodes, write scripts, draw storyboards, record with DSLR cameras and edit and export with software such as Adobe Premiere Pro. But most of all they will get the chance to document the very essence of EASA, the EASA spirit. Since 2007

==EASA FM==
EASA FM is a temporary radio station that was started in EASA011, Cadiz/Spain.

[[File:Foot whipping.JPG|thumb|262px|Bastinado demonstration using a cane]]
'''Foot whipping''' or '''bastinado''' is a method of [[corporal punishment]] which consists of hitting the soles of a person's bare [[feet]]. Unlike most types of flogging, this punishment was meant to be more painful than it was to cause actual injury to the victim. Blows were generally delivered with a light rod, knotted cord, or lash.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/flogging#ref177595&lt;/ref&gt;

The receiving person is required to be [[barefoot]]. The uncovered [[sole (foot)|soles]] of the feet need to be placed in an exposed position. The beating is typically performed with an object in the type of a [[caning|cane]] or [[Switch (corporal punishment)|switch]]. The strokes are usually aimed at the [[arches of the foot|arches of the feet]] and repeated a certain number of times.

Bastinado is also referred to as ''foot (bottom) caning'' or ''sole caning'', depending on the instrument in use. The particular Middle East method is called ''falaka'' or ''falanga'',&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. [[Wolfgang Schweickard]], [http://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/schweickard/turkisms-in-italian-french-and-german/articles.html ''Turkisms in Italian, French and German (Ottoman Period, 1300-1900). A historical and etymological dictionary'' s.v. ''falaka'']&lt;/ref&gt; derived from the Greek term ''[[phalanx]]''. The German term is ''Bastonade'', deriving from the Italian noun ''bastonata'' (''stroke with the use of a stick''). In former times it was also referred to as ''Sohlenstreich'' (corr. ''striking the soles''). The Chinese term is ''da jiao xin''.

==Overview==
The first scripted documentation of bastinado in Europe dates back to the year 1537, in China to 960.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=274}} References to bastinado have been hypothesised to be found in the [[Bible]] (Prov. 22:15; Lev. 19:20; Deut. 22:18), suggesting the practice since antiquity.&lt;ref name="www.biblegateway.com"&gt;{{cite web| title=BASTINADO| url=http://www.biblegateway.com/resources/dictionaries/dict_meaning.php?source=1&amp;wid=T0000469| publisher=www.biblegateway.com| accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This subform of [[flagellation]] differentiates from most other forms by limiting the strokes to a very narrow section of the body. The beatings typically aim at the vaults of the feet where the soles are particularly pain sensitive, at this usually avoiding hitting the balls and heels directly but concentrating on the small area in between.

As the skin texture under the soles of the feet can naturally endure high levels of strain, injuries demanding medical attention, such as lacerations or bruises, are rarely inflicted if certain precautions are observed by the executant. The undersides of the feet have therefore become a common target for corporal punishment in many cultures while basically different methods exist.

Foot whipping is typically carried out within [[prison]]s and similar institutions. Besides inflicting intense physical suffering it trades on the significance of bare feet as a dishonouring socio-cultural attribute. Therefore, it is regarded to be a particularly humiliating as well as degrading form of punishment.

As wearing shoes is an integral element of societal appearance since antiquity, the visual exposure of bare feet is a traditional and sometimes even [[Barefoot#Religious aspects|ritualistic practice]] to display the subjection or submission of a person under a manifestation of superior power. At this was often used as a visual indicator of a subservient standing within a social structure and to display the imbalance in power. It was therefore routinely imposed as a visual identifier and obstacle on [[Barefoot#Imprisonment and slavery|slaves]] and [[prisoner]]s, often divested of rights and liberties in a similar manner. Exploiting its socio-cultural significance, people have been forced to go barefoot as a formal [[Badge of shame#Bare feet|shame sanction]] and for [[Public humiliation#Shameful exposure|public humiliation]] as well. Keeping prisoners barefoot is common practice [[Barefoot#Imprisonment|in several countries]] of today.

Foot whipping therefore poses a distinct threat and is often particularly dreaded by potential victims (usually prisoners). Exploiting the effects this penalty is typically used to maintain discipline and compliance in prisons.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Eysenck, Meili: Lexikon der Psychologie (Encyclopedia of Psychology), Band 3, 1973, S. 476f, {{ISBN|3-451-16113-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bastinado is commonly associated with Middle and Far Eastern nations, where it is occasionally executed in public, therefore covered by occasional reports and photographs. However it has been frequently practised within in the Western World as well, particularly in [[prison]]s, [[reformatory|reformatories]], [[boarding school]]s and similar institutions.

In Europe bastinado was a frequently encountered form of corporal punishment particularly in German areas, where it was mainly carried out to enforce [[Discipline#Prison discipline|discipline]] within penal and reformatory institutions, culminating during the [[Nazi-Germany|Third Reich]] era. In several German and Austrian institutions it was still practised during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="kurier.at"&gt;{{cite web| title=Wimmersdorf: 270 Schläge auf die Fußsohlen| url=http://kurier.at/chronik/niederoesterreich/wimmersdorf-270-schlaege-auf-die-fusssohlen/30.980.261| language=de| publisher=kurier.at| accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="krone.at"&gt;"krone.at" vom 29. März 2012 [http://www.krone.at/Oesterreich/Berichte_ueber_Folter_in_Kinder-Heim_auf_der_Hohen_Warte-Schwere_Vorwuerfe-Story-316489 Berichte über Folter im Kinderheim auf der Hohen Warte]; 3 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=275}}&lt;ref name="Cesereanu"&gt;Ruxandra Cesereanu: ''An Overview of Political Torture in the Twentieth Century''. p. 124f.&lt;/ref&gt; Although bastinado was practiced in penal institutions of the Western world until the late 20th century, it was barely noticed as there is no reference to ever being adjudged on a high level. Instead it was carried out on a rather low level within the confines of the institutions, typically to punish inmates during incarceration. If not specifically authorized the practice was usually condoned, while happening unbeknown to the public. Also foot whipping hardly attracts public interest in general as it appears unspectacular and relatively inoffensive compared to other punishment methods. As it was not executed publicly in the western world, it came to be witnessed only by the individuals directly involved. At this former prisoners rarely communicate incidents as bastinado is widely perceived as a degrading punishment (see [[Public humiliation#Shameful exposure|public humiliation]]), while former executants are usually obliged to confidentiality.

Bastinado is still used as prison punishment in several countries (see below). As it causes a high level of suffering for the victim and [[physical evidence]] remains largely undetectable after some time, it is frequently used for [[interrogation]] and [[torture]].

== Appearance ==
Bastinado usually requires a certain amount of collaborative effort and an authoritarian presence on the executing party to be enforced. Therefore, it typically appears in settings where corporal punishment is officially approved to be exerted on predefined group of people. This can be situations of imprisonment and incarceration as well as [[slavery]]. This moderated subform of [[flagellation]] is characteristically prevalent where subjected individuals are forced to remain barefoot.

=== Regional ===
Foot whipping was common practice as means of disciplinary punishment in different kinds of institutions throughout Central Europe until the 1950s, especially in German territories.&lt;ref name="kurier.at" /&gt;&lt;ref name="krone.at" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;
In German prisons this method consistently served as the principal disciplinary punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hawkins |first=Francis Bisset |title=Germany: The Spirit of Her History, Literature, Social Condition and National Economy : Illustrated by Reference to Her Physical, Moral, and Political Statistics, and by Comparison with Other Countries |publisher=Charles Jugel at the German and foreign library |date=1839 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] era it was frequently used in German penal institutions and labour camps.&lt;br&gt;It was also inflicted on the population in occupied territories, notably Denmark and Norway.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=275}}

During the era of slavery in Brazil and the American South it was often used whenever so-called "clean beating" instead of the prevalent more radical forms of [[flagellation]] was demanded. This was the case when a loss in market value through visible injuries especially on females was to be avoided. As many so-called "slave-codes" included a barefoot constraint, bastinado required minimal effort to be performed.&lt;ref name="WCG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cape Town and Surrounds.|url=https://www.westerncape.gov.za/general-publication/places-slave-rememberance-western-cape?toc_page=3|publisher=Western Cape Government| accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was sufficiently effective but usually left no visible or relevant injuries, bastinado was often used as an alternative for female slaves with higher market value.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=277}}

Bastinado is still practised in penal institutions of several countries around the world. In a 1967 survey 83% of the inmates in Greek prisons reported about frequent infliction of bastinado. It was also used against rioting students. In Spanish prisons 39% of the inmates reported about this kind of treatment. The French [[Sûreté]] reportedly used it to extract confessions. British occupants used it in Palestine, French occupants in Algeria. Within colonial India it was used to punish tax offenders. Within penal institutions in Europe bastinado was reportedly used in Germany, Austria, France, Spain, Greece, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Portugal, Macedonia, Lithuania, Georgia, Ukraine, Cyprus, Slovakia and Croatia. Other nations with documented use of bastinado are Syria, Israel, Turkey, Morocco, Iran, Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Lebanon, Tunisia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Brazil, Argentina, Nicaragua, Chile, South Africa, Venezuela, Rhodesia, Zimbabwe, Paraguay, Honduras, Bolivia, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Cameroon, Mauritius, Philippines, South Korea, Pakistan and Nepal.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=275}}

*British colonial police officer [[Charles Tegart]] is said to have instituted foot whipping, a practice derived from the former Ottoman rule, in an interrogation centre established at [[Jerusalem]] in 1938, as part of the effort to crush the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]].
*Foot whipping was used by [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] [[Blackshirts]] against [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] critical of [[Benito Mussolini]] as early as 1923 (Dalzell, 1961).
*It was used as a method of torture during the [[Greek Civil War]] of 1946 to 1949 and the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|regime of the Colonels]] in [[Greece]], from 1967 to 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RSvAKgxEhuwC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=%22the+method%22+%22pericles+korovessis%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3aPF0lGYhX&amp;sig=3CVj_Nh66-ZnpUOGTROf6DRtaI0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JQGYUpSKJ4PxhQeq0YGYAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20method%22%20%22pericles%20korovessis%22&amp;f=false Pericles Korovessis, ''The Method: A Personal Account of the Tortures in Greece''], trans.

*[[Bahá'u'lláh]] (founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]) underwent foot whipping in August 1852 as a follower of the Babi religion. (Esslemont, 1937).
*It was used throughout the [[Ottoman Empire]].
*Foot whipping was used at the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|S-21]] prison in [[Phnom Penh]] during the rule of the [[Khmer Rouge]] and is mentioned in the ten regulations to prisoners now on display in the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]].
*This punishment has, at various times, been used in [[China]], as well as the [[Middle East]]. "No crimes pass unpunished in China. The bastinado is the common punishment for slight faults, and the number of blows is proportionable to the nature of the fault... When the number of blows does not exceed twenty, it is accounted a fatherly correction. The emperor himself sometimes commands it to be inflicted on great persons, and afterwards sees them and treats them as usual." &lt;ref&gt;https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1680halde3.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antoin Sevruguin 12 Falak Whipping the soles of a criminal.jpg|thumb|left|Middle Eastern falaka using a plank; [[Iran]], early 20th century]]
[[File:Third Reich bastonade table.jpg|thumb|Depiction of punishment bench as used for bastinado in several German prisons during the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] era]] 
The prisoner is barefooted and restrained in such manner, that the feet cannot be shifted out of position. The intention is to avert serious injuries of the forefoot by stray hitting, especially of the fracturable [[toe]]s. The energy of the stroke impacts is typically meant to be absorbed by the muscular tissue inside the vaults of the feet.

The Middle Eastern ''falaka'' method entails tying up the person's feet into an elevated position while lying on the back, the beating is generally performed with a rigid wooden stick, a club or a truncheon. The term ''falaka'' describes the wooden plank used to tie up the ankles, however different items are used for this purpose. The essentially different German method, which was practiced until the end of the [[Nazism|Third Reich]] era, consisted in strapping the barefoot prisoner prone onto a wooden bench or a plank. Hereby the feet were forced into a pointed posture ([[Plantarflexion#Flexion and extension of the foot|plantar flexion]]) with their bare undersides facing upward. For this purpose the upper body and both ankles were strapped onto the bench. The prisoner's hands were tied behind the back, usually using a cord or a leather strap. Hereby the person was rendered largely immobile and was especially not able to move the feet out of their forced position. The typically occurring contortions of the body during the execution were largely halted as well. This way the punishment could be inflicted with a certain degree of accuracy to not cause unwanted lesions or other severe injury. It was typically executed with a slightly flexible beating accessory such as a [[caning|cane]] or a [[switch (corporal punishment)|switch]]. More infrequently also short [[whip]]s or leather straps were used. This form of punishment was mainly employed in women's penal institutions and [[labor camp]]s where prisoners were often kept barefoot.&lt;ref name="Cesereanu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AI Newsletter 09-1987 [http://ob.nubati.net/wiki/Illustrated_Reports_of_Amnesty_International Illustrated Reports of Amnesty International] 20 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The middle eastern ''falaka'' is more inclined to cause serious injuries such as bone fractures and nerve damage than the German method, as the person undergoing falaka can move the body and feet to a certain degree. As a result, the strokes impact more or less randomly and injury-prone areas are frequently affected. As falaka is usually carried out with a rigid and often heavy stick, it accordingly causes [[blunt trauma]] leaving the person unable to walk and often impeded for life. For the German form, the prisoner was principally unable to move and the beatings were performed with lightweight objects that were relatively thin in diameter and usually slightly flexible. The physical aftereffects of the procedure remained mostly superficial and unwanted injuries were relatively rare. Therefore, the person usually remained capable of walking right after the punishment. Still, the German form of bastinado caused severe levels of pain and suffering for the receiving person.

== Effects ==
The beatings usually aim at the tender [[longitudinal arch of the foot]] avoiding the bone structure of the ball and the heel. The vaults are particularly touch-sensitive and therefore susceptible to pain due to the tight clustering of [[nerve|nerve ending]]s.

=== Corporal ===
[[File:Bastinado visible aftereffects.JPG|thumb|160px|Visible welts typically sustained after bastinado]]
When exerted with a thin and flexible object of lighter weight the corporal effects usually remain temporary. The numerous [[bone]]s and [[tendon]]s of the foot are sufficiently protected by [[muscular tissue]] so the impact is absorbed by the skin and muscular tissue. The skin under the soles of the human feet is of high elasticity and consistence similar to the palms of the hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medizinfo.de/hautundhaar/anatomie/lederhaut.htm Lederhaut] in „MedizInfo“ about the dermis; 20 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Lesions and [[hematoma]] therefore rarely occur while beating marks are mostly superficial. Depending on the characteristics of the beating device in use and the intensity of the beatings the emerging visible aftereffects remain ascertainable over a time frame of a few hours to several days. The receiving person usually remains able to walk without help right after the punishment.

When the beating is executed with heavy sticks like clubs or truncheons according to the falaka method, bone fractures commonly occur as well as nerve damage and severe hematoma. The sustained injuries can take a long time to heal with even lasting or irreversible physical damage to the [[human musculoskeletal system]].

When thin and flexible instruments are used the immediate experience of pain is described as acutely stinging and searing. The instant sensations are disproportionally intense compared to the applied force and reflexively radiate through the body. The subsequent pain sensations of a succession of strokes are often described as throbbing, piercing or burning and gradually ease off within a few hours. A slightly stinging or nagging sensation often remains perceptible for a couple of days, especially while walking.

As the nerve endings under the soles of the feet do not adapt to recurring sensations or impacts, the pain reception does not alleviate through continuous beatings. On the contrary the perception of pain is further intensified over the course of additional impacts through the activation of [[nociceptor]]s. Over a sequence of impacts applied with nearly constant force the perception of pain is therefore progressively intensifying until a maximum level of activation is reached. For that reason a facile impact can already cause an acute pain sensation after a certain number of preceding strokes.

The subjective experience of corporal suffering can however largely diverge according to a person's individual [[pain tolerance]]. The pain reception itself is hereby aggravated through feelings of anxiety and agitation. The subjective pain susceptibility is accordingly higher the more apprehensive the individual feels about it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medizinfo.de/schmerz/rezeptor.htm Schmerzrezeptoren] in „MedizInfo“ about pain receptors; 20 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weiss.de/krankheiten/fibro/ursachen/schmerz-angst/ Schmerz und Angst] in „Praxisklinik Dr. med. Thomas Weiss“ about intensification of pain through anxiety; 20 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Further the female gender generally experiences physical pain notably more intensive and typically reacts with a higher level of anxiety. At the same time women are distinctly sensitive to pressure pain. According to respective assertions women's subjective suffering under the infliction of foot whipping therefore is significantly more severe. The acute pain sensations can hereby be experienced as largely intolerable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschlechterstudien.de/1-1-schmerzforschung.html Schmerzforschung] in „GeschlechterStudien“ (gender studies) about pain research; 17 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental ===
Seizing and withholding the footwear from a person in a situation of imprisonment, which is commonplace in many countries ([[Barefoot#Imprisonment and slavery]]), often has a disconsolating and victimizing effect on the individual. As bare feet are traditionally regarded as a token of subjection and captivity, the unaccustomed and largely reluctant exposure is often perceived as humiliating or oppressive. The increased physical [[vulnerability]] by having to remain barefoot often leads to trepidation and the feeling of insecurity.
This measure alone can therefore already cause significant distress.&lt;ref name="zimbabwe_prisoners"&gt;{{cite news|title=Long hours in a Harare Jail.|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2018917.stm|accessdate=6 October 2014|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=1 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This circumstance is usually aggravated if the bare feet are the target for corporal punishment.
The feet are typically hidden away and protected by footwear in most social situations, hereby avoiding unwanted exposure. Therefore, the enforced exposure for the purpose of punishment is mostly perceived as a form of harassment. The obligatory restraints further add to the anxiety and humiliation of the captive.

Any form of methodical corporal punishment typically causes a high level of distress through the inflicted pain and the experience of being defenseless and unable to evade the situation. The mostly occurring loss of composure during the punishment as well as the experience of weakness and vulnerability often permanently damages a person’s [[self-esteem]].

Beating the undersides of a person's feet moreover conveys an especially steep imbalance in power between the executing party (prison staff or similar) towards the receiving individual (typically prison inmate). A rather private area of the body, which traditionally remains covered or not visible in the presence of other people, is forcibly exposed and beaten. This act represents a blunt intrusion into the sphere of personal privacy and an according elimination of [[personal boundaries]]. By this means the receiving person experiences his or her individual powerlessness against the executing authority in a particularly manifest way. This experience can also change or deconstruct the individual's [[Self-perception theory|self-perception]] and [[self-awareness]].

As a result, the experience of bastinado leads to drastic physical and mental suffering for the receiving individual and is therefore regarded as a highly effectual method of corporal punishment. 
Exploiting the effects of bastinado on a person, it is still frequently employed on prisoners in several countries.

{{Frankfurt School}}
The '''Frankfurt School''' ({{lang-de|Frankfurter Schule}}) is a school of [[social theory]] and philosophy associated in part with the [[Institute for Social Research]] at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]. Founded during the [[interwar period]], the School consisted of [[Western Marxist]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-theory/ "Critical Theory" on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; dissidents uncomfortable with existing [[capitalist]], [[fascist]] or [[communist]] systems. Many of these theorists believed that traditional theory could not adequately explain the turbulent and unexpected development of capitalist societies in the 20th century. Critical of both capitalism and [[Marxism–Leninism|Soviet socialism]], their writings pointed to the possibility of an alternative path to [[social development]].&lt;ref&gt;Held, David (1980). ''Introduction to critical theory: Horkheimer to Habermas''. University of California Press, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

These theorists were sometimes only loosely affiliated, and some authors point out that the "Frankfurt Circle" was neither a philosophical school nor a political group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Following Marx, they were concerned with the conditions that allow for [[social change]] and the establishment of rational institutions.&lt;ref name="Held, David 1980, p. 15"&gt;Held, David (1980), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Their emphasis on the [[Critical theory#In social theory|"critical" component of theory]] was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of [[positivism]], [[materialism]] and [[determinism]] by returning to Kant's [[critical philosophy]] and its successors in [[German idealism]], principally Hegel's philosophy, with its emphasis on [[Dialectic#Modern philosophy|dialectic]] and [[Contradiction#Dialectical materialism|contradiction]] as inherent properties of human reality.

Since the 1960s, Frankfurt School's critical theory has increasingly been guided by [[Jürgen Habermas|Jürgen Habermas's]] work on [[Communicative rationality|communicative reason]], linguistic [[intersubjectivity]] and what Habermas calls "the philosophical discourse of [[Modernity#In sociological thought|modernity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen. (1987). ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity''. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical theorists such as [[Raymond Geuss]] and [[Nikolas Kompridis]] have voiced opposition to Habermas, holding that he has undermined the aspirations for social change that originally gave purpose to critical theory's various projects—for example the problem of what [[reason]] should mean, the analysis and enlargement of "conditions of possibility" for social [[emancipation]] and the critique of modern capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Kompridis, Nikolas. (2006). ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'', MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Institute for Social Research===
{{Main|Institute for Social Research}}
{{Marxism|Variants}}
The term "Frankfurt School" arose informally to describe the thinkers affiliated or merely associated with the Frankfurt [[Institute for Social Research]]; it is not the title of any specific position or institution ''per se'', and few of these theorists used the term themselves. The Institute for Social Research (''Institut für Sozialforschung'') was founded in 1923 by [[Carl Grünberg]], a Marxist legal and political professor at the [[University of Vienna]],&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;Corradetti, Claudio (2011). [http://www.iep.utm.edu/frankfur/ "The Frankfurt School and Critical Theory"], Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Originally published: 21 October 2011).
&lt;/ref&gt; as an adjunct of the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]]; it was the first Marxist-oriented research center affiliated with a major German university.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt; However, the school can trace its earliest roots back to [[Felix Weil]], who used money from his father's grain business to finance the ''Institut''.

Weil (1898–1975), a young Marxist, had written his [[Thesis or dissertation|doctoral thesis]] (published by [[Karl Korsch]]) on the practical problems of implementing socialism. With the hope of bringing different trends of Marxism together, Weil organized a week-long symposium (the ''Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche'') in 1922 in [[Ilmenau]], [[Thuringia]], a meeting attended by [[György Lukács|Georg Lukács]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Karl August Wittfogel]], [[Friedrich Pollock]] and others. The event was so successful that Weil set about erecting a building and funding salaries for a permanent institute. Weil negotiated with the Ministry of Education that the Director of the Institute would be a full professor from the state system, so that the ''Institut'' would have the status of a University institution.&lt;ref name="Marxist Internet Archive"&gt;"The Frankfurt School and Critical Theory", [http://www.marxists.org/subject/frankfurt-school/index.htm Marxist Internet Archive] (Retrieved 12 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Georg Lukács and Karl Korsch both attended the ''Arbeitswoche'', which had included a study of Korsch's ''Marxism and Philosophy,'' but both were too committed to political activity and party membership to join the ''Institut'', though Korsch participated in publishing ventures for a number of years. Lukács 1923 work ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' was probably a major inspiration for the work of the Frankfurt School; his later repudiation of the work, required by the Soviet Union, demonstrated the value of independence from the [[Communist Party]] for genuine theoretical work.&lt;ref name="Marxist Internet Archive"/&gt;

The philosophical tradition now referred to as the "Frankfurt School" is perhaps particularly associated with [[Max Horkheimer]] (philosopher, sociologist and social psychologist), who took over as the institute's director in 1930 and recruited many of the school's most talented theorists, including [[Theodor W. Adorno]] (philosopher, sociologist, musicologist), [[Erich Fromm]] (psychoanalyst), and [[Herbert Marcuse]] (philosopher).&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

===German prewar context===
The political turmoil of [[Weimar Republic|Germany's troubled interwar years]] greatly affected the School's development. Its thinkers were particularly influenced by the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|failure of the communist revolution in Western Europe]] (precisely where Marx had predicted that a communist revolution would take place) and by the rise of [[Nazism]] in such an economically and technologically advanced nation as Germany.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} This led many of them to take up the task of choosing what parts of Marx's thought might serve to clarify contemporary social conditions that Marx himself had never seen. Another key influence also came from the publication in the 1930s of Marx's ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts]]'' and ''[[The German Ideology]]'', which showed the continuity with [[Hegelianism]] that underlay Marx's thought.

As the growing influence of National Socialism became ever more threatening, its founders decided to prepare to move the Institute out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;"The Origins of Critical Theory: An interview with Leo Lowenthal" by Helmut Dubiel in ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]'' 49&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]] in 1933, the Institute left Germany for [[Geneva]], before moving to [[New York City]] in 1935, where it became affiliated with [[Columbia University]]. Its journal ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' was accordingly renamed ''Studies in Philosophy and Social Science''. It was at this moment that much of its important work began to emerge, having gained a favorable reception within American and English [[academia]]. Horkheimer, Adorno and Pollock eventually resettled in [[West Germany]] in the early 1950s, although Marcuse, Lowenthal, Kirchheimer and others chose to remain in the United States. It was only in 1953 that the Institute was formally re-established in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David (1980), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theorists===
{{See also|List of critical theorists}}
Which "theorists" to include in what is now called the "Frankfurt School" may vary among different scholars. Indeed, the title of "school" can often be misleading, as the Institute's members did not always form a series of tightly woven, complementary projects. Some scholars have therefore limited their view of the Frankfurt School to Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, Lowenthal and Pollock.&lt;ref name="Held, David 1980, p. 15"/&gt; However, most pre-war theorists can be considered as having shared a very similar paradigm. Most of the members of the Institute for Social Research were of [[Jewish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;Finlayson, James Gordon (2005), ''Habermas: A Very Short Introduction'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was initially part of the School's inner circle, [[Jürgen Habermas]] is generally considered as the first to have diverged from Horkheimer's research program, thus giving rise to a new generation of [[critical theory|critical theorists]].

==Theoretical work==
===Critical theory and the critique of ideology===
The Frankfurt School's work cannot be addressed without understanding the objectives of critical theory. Initially outlined by [[Max Horkheimer]] in his ''Traditional and Critical Theory'' (1937), critical theory may be defined as a self-conscious [[social]] critique that is aimed at change and emancipation through enlightenment and that does not cling dogmatically to its own doctrinal assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Geuss, Raymond (1981). ''The idea of a critical theory: Habermas and the Frankfurt school''. Cambridge University Press, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr, Adrian 2000 p. 208-220"&gt;Carr, Adrian (2000). "Critical theory and the management of change in organizations". In: ''Journal of Organizational Change Management'', 13, 3, p. 208–220&lt;/ref&gt; The original aim of critical theory was to analyze the true significance of "the ruling understandings" generated in bourgeois society, in order to show how they {{em|misrepresented}} actual human interaction in the real world, and in so doing functioned to {{em|justify}} or {{em|legitimize}} the domination of people by capitalism. A certain sort of story (a narrative) was provided to explain what was happening in society, but the story concealed as much as it revealed. The Frankfurt theorists generally assumed that their task was mainly to interpret the areas of society Marx had not dealt with, especially in the [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] of society.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Jay, ''The Dialectical Imagination. A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research 1923–1950''. London: Heinemann, 1973, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horkheimer opposed it to ''traditional theory'', which refers to theory in the positivistic, [[scientism|scientistic]], or purely observational mode—that is, which derives generalizations or "[[scientific law|laws]]" about different aspects of the world. Drawing upon Max Weber, Horkheimer argued that the [[social science]]s differ from the [[natural science]]s inasmuch as generalizations cannot be easily made from so-called experiences because the understanding of a "social" experience itself is always fashioned by ideas that are in the researchers themselves. What the researcher does not realize is that s/he is caught in a historical context in which ideologies shape the thinking; thus, theory would conform to the ideas in the mind of the researcher rather than to the experience itself:

{{quote|The facts which our senses present to us are socially performed in two ways: through the historical character of the object perceived and through the historical character of the perceiving organ. Both are not simply natural; they are shaped by human activity, and yet the individual perceives himself as receptive and passive in the act of perception.&lt;ref&gt;Horkheimer, Max (1976). "Traditional and critical theory". In: Connerton, P (Eds), ''Critical Sociology: Selected Readings'', Penguin, Harmondsworth, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Horkheimer, approaches to understanding in the social sciences cannot simply imitate those in the natural sciences. Although various theoretical approaches would come close to breaking out of the ideological constraints that restricted them, such as positivism, [[pragmatism]], [[neo-Kantianism]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], Horkheimer argued that they failed because all were subject to a "logico-mathematical" prejudice that separates theoretical activity from actual life (meaning that all these schools sought to find a logic that always remains true, independently of and without consideration for ongoing human activities). According to Horkheimer, the appropriate response to this dilemma is the development of a critical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen, D. (1996). "Critical theory and philosophy". In: Rasmussen, D. (Eds), ''The Handbook of Critical Theory'', Blackwell, Oxford, p .18&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem, Horkheimer argued, is [[epistemology|epistemological]]: we should reconsider not merely the scientist but the knowing individual in general.&lt;ref&gt;Horkheimer, Max (1976), p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[orthodox Marxism]], which merely applies a ready-made "template" to both critique and action, critical theory seeks to be self-critical and rejects any pretensions to [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. Critical theory defends the primacy of neither matter (materialism) nor consciousness ([[idealism]]), and argues that both epistemologies distort reality to the benefit, eventually, of some small group. What critical theory attempts to do is to place itself outside of philosophical strictures and the confines of existing structures. However, as a way of thinking and "recovering" humanity's self-knowledge, critical theory often looks to Marxism for its methods and tools.&lt;ref name="Carr, Adrian 2000 p. 208-220"/&gt;

Horkheimer maintained that critical theory should be directed at the totality of society in its [[Zeitgeist|historical specificity]] (i.e., how it came to be configured at a specific point in time), just as it should improve understanding of society by integrating all the major social sciences, including geography, economics, sociology, history, political science, anthropology, and psychology. While critical theory must at all times be self-critical, Horkheimer insisted that a theory is critical only if it is explanatory. Critical theory must, therefore, combine practical and normative thinking to "explain what is wrong with current social reality, identify actors to change it, and provide clear norms for criticism and practical goals for the future."&lt;ref&gt;Bohman, J (1996). "Critical theory and democracy". In: Rasmussen, D. (Eds), ''The Handbook of Critical Theory'', Blackwell, Oxford, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas traditional theory can only mirror and explain reality as it presently is, critical theory's purpose is to {{em|change}} it; in Horkheimer's words the goal of critical theory is "the emancipation of human beings from the circumstances that enslave them".&lt;ref&gt;Horkheimer, Max (1976), p. 219 (see also p. 224)&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankfurt School theorists explicitly linked up with the critical philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], in which the term ''[[critique]]'' meant philosophical reflection on the limits of claims made for certain kinds of knowledge and direct connection between such critique and the emphasis on [[Autonomy#Philosophy|moral autonomy]] as opposed to traditionally deterministic and static theories of human action. In an intellectual context defined by dogmatic positivism and scientism on the one hand and dogmatic "[[scientific socialism]]" on the other, critical theorists intended to rehabilitate Marx's ideas through a philosophically critical approach.

Whereas both [[Marxist–Leninist]] and [[social democratic]] orthodox thinkers viewed Marxism as a new kind of positive science, Frankfurt School theorists such as Horkheimer instead based their work on the epistemological base of Marx's work, which presented itself as critique, as in Marx's ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy]]''. They thus emphasized that Marx attempted to create a new kind of critical analysis oriented toward the unity of theory and [[praxis (process)|revolutionary practice]] rather than a new kind of positive science. Critique, in this Marxian sense, means taking the ideology of a society (for example, the belief in [[individual freedom]] or [[free market]] capitalism) and critiquing it by comparing it with a posited social reality of that very society (for example, [[social inequality]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]). Frankfurt School theorists grounded this on the dialectical methodology established by Hegel and Marx.

===Dialectical method===
The Institute also attempted to reformulate dialectics as a concrete method. The use of such a dialectical method can be traced back to the philosophy of Hegel, who conceived dialectic as the tendency of a notion to pass over into its own negation as the result of conflict between its inherent contradictory aspects.&lt;ref name="dialectic1"&gt;dialectic. (2009). In [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Retrieved 19 December 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/161174/dialectic http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/161174/dialectic]&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to previous modes of thought, which viewed things in abstraction, each by itself and as though endowed with fixed properties, Hegelian dialectic has the ability to consider ideas according to their movement and change in time, as well as according to their interrelations and interactions.&lt;ref name="dialectic1" /&gt;

History, according to Hegel, proceeds and evolves in a dialectical manner: the present embodies the rational [[Aufheben|sublation]], or "synthesis", of past contradictions. History may thus be seen as an intelligible process (which Hegel referred to as {{lang|de|[[Geist#The Weltgeist|Weltgeist]]}}), which is the [[Idea of Progress|moving towards a specific condition]]—the rational realization of human freedom.&lt;ref name="HegelStanford"&gt;Little, D. (2007). "Philosophy of History", The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (Sun 18 February 2007), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/history/#HegHis http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/history/#HegHis]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Problem of future contingents|considerations about the future]] were of no interest to Hegel,&lt;ref&gt;"When philosophy paints its grey on grey, then has a shape of life grown old. (...) The [[owl of Minerva]] spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk" – Hegel, G. W. F. (1821). {{lang|de|[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts]]}}, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hegel's philosophy, and in particular his political philosophy, purports to be the rational formulation of a definite historical period, and Hegel refuses to look further ahead into the future." – Peĺczynski, Z. A. (1971). ''Hegel's political philosophy—problems and perspectives: a collection of new essays'', CUP Archive. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JEI4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA200 Google Print, p. 200]&lt;/ref&gt; for whom philosophy cannot be [[Normative#Philosophy|prescriptive]] because it understands only in hindsight. The study of history is thus limited to the description of past and present realities.&lt;ref name="HegelStanford" /&gt; Hence for Hegel and his [[Right Hegelians|successors]], dialectics inevitably lead to the approval of the [[status quo]]—indeed, Hegel's philosophy served as a justification for [[Christian theology]] and the [[Prussia|Prussian state]].

This was fiercely criticized by Marx and the [[Young Hegelians]], who argued that Hegel had gone too far in defending his abstract conception of "absolute Reason" and had failed to notice the "real"—i.e. {{em|undesirable}} and {{em|irrational}}—life conditions of the [[Proletariat|working class]]. By turning Hegel's idealist dialectics upside-down, Marx advanced his own theory of [[dialectical materialism]], arguing that "it is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx (1859), Preface to {{lang|de|[[Das Kapital|Das Kapital: Kritik der politischen Ökonomie]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's theory follows a [[Historical materialism|materialist conception of history]] and [[Marxist geography|space]],&lt;ref&gt;Soja, E. (1989). Postmodern Geographies. London: Verso. (esp. pp. 76–93)&lt;/ref&gt; where the development of the productive forces is seen as the primary motive force for historical change, and according to which the social and material [[Contradictions#Dialectical materialism|contradictions]] inherent to capitalism inevitably lead to its negation—thereby replacing capitalism with a new rational form of society: [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |editor=Jonathan Wolff, Ph.D. |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=Karl Marx |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/ |access-date=17 September 2009 |edition= |date= |year= |publisher=Stanford |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx thus extensively relied on a form of dialectical analysis. This method—to know the truth by uncovering the contradictions in presently predominant ideas and, by extension, in the social relations to which they are linked—exposes the underlying struggle between opposing forces. For Marx, it is only by becoming aware of the dialectic (i.e., [[class consciousness]]) of such opposing forces, in a struggle for power, that individuals can liberate themselves and change the existing social order.&lt;ref&gt;Seiler, Robert M. "Human Communication in the Critical Theory Tradition", University of Calgary, [http://people.ucalgary.ca/~rseiler/critical.htm Online Publication]&lt;/ref&gt;

For their part, Frankfurt School theorists quickly came to realize that a dialectical method could only be adopted {{em|if it could be applied to itself}}—that is to say, if they adopted a self-correcting method—a dialectical method that would enable them to correct previous false dialectical interpretations. Accordingly, critical theory rejected the [[historicism]] and materialism of [[orthodox Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, J. M. (1994) ''The Frankfurt School: critical assessments'', Volume 3, Taylor &amp; Francis, p. 208 (See also pp. 199–202)&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the material tensions and [[class struggle]]s of which Marx spoke were no longer seen by Frankfurt School theorists as having the same [[Communist revolution|revolutionary potential]] within contemporary Western societies—an observation that indicated that Marx's dialectical interpretations and predictions were either incomplete or incorrect.

Contrary to orthodox Marxist [[Praxis (process)|praxis]], which solely seeks to implement an unchangeable and narrow idea of "communism" into practice, critical theorists held that praxis and theory, following the dialectical method, should be interdependent and should mutually influence each other. When Marx famously stated in his ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'' that "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it", his real idea was that philosophy's only validity was in how it informed action. Frankfurt School theorists would correct this by arguing that when action fails, then the theory guiding it must be reviewed. In short, socialist philosophical thought must be given the ability to criticize itself and "overcome" its own errors. While theory must inform praxis, praxis must also have a chance to inform theory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

|}

Responding to the intensification of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and [[irrationality]] in an [[advanced capitalist society]], critical theory is a comprehensive, ideology-critical, historically self-reflective body of theory aiming simultaneously to explain domination and point to the possibilities of bringing about a rational, humane, and free society. Frankfurt School critical theorists developed numerous theories of the economic, political, cultural, and psychological domination structures of advanced industrial civilization.

The Institute made major contributions in two areas relating to the possibility of human [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]s to be rational, i.e., individuals who could act rationally to take charge of their own [[society]] and their own [[history]]. The first consisted of social phenomena previously considered in Marxism as part of the "[[base and superstructure|superstructure]]" or as [[ideology]]: [[Personality psychology|personality]], [[family]] and [[authority]] structures (one of the earliest works published bore the title ''Studies of Authority and the Family''), and the realm of [[aesthetics]] and mass culture. Studies saw a common concern here in the ability of capitalism to destroy the preconditions of critical, revolutionary [[political consciousness]]. This meant arriving at a sophisticated awareness of the depth dimension in which social [[oppression]] sustains itself. It also meant the beginning of critical theory's recognition of ideology as part of the foundations of social structure.

===Critique of Western civilization===
====''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' and ''Minima Moralia''====
The second phase of Frankfurt School critical theory centres principally on two works: [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]]'s ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1944) and Adorno's ''[[Minima Moralia]]'' (1951). The authors wrote both works during the Institute's exile in America. While retaining much of a Marxian analysis, in these works critical theory shifted its emphasis from the critique of capitalism to a critique of [[Western civilization]] as a whole, as seen in ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', which uses the  ''[[Odyssey]]'' as a paradigm for their analysis of [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] consciousness. In these works, Horkheimer and Adorno present many themes that have come to dominate the [[social thought]] of recent years; for instance, their exposition of the [[Nature#Human interrelationship|domination of nature]] as a central characteristic of [[instrumental rationality]] in Western civilization was made long before [[ecology]] and [[environmentalism]] had become popular concerns.

The analysis of reason now goes one stage further: The [[rationality]] of Western civilization appears as a fusion of domination and technological rationality, bringing all of external and internal nature under the power of the human subject. In the process, however, the subject itself gets swallowed up and no social force analogous to the [[proletariat]] can be identified that enables the subject to emancipate itself. Hence the subtitle of ''Minima Moralia'': "Reflections from Damaged Life". In Adorno's words,

{{quote|For since the overwhelming objectivity of historical movement in its present phase consists so far only in the dissolution of the subject, without yet giving rise to a new one, individual experience necessarily bases itself on the old subject, now historically condemned, which is still for-itself, but no longer in-itself. The subject still feels sure of its autonomy, but the nullity demonstrated to subjects by the concentration camp is already overtaking the form of subjectivity itself.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor W. Adorno, ''Minima Moralia: Reflections on a Damaged Life,'' Verso (2006), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Consequently, at a time when it appears that reality itself has become the basis for ideology, the greatest contribution that critical theory can make is to explore the dialectical contradictions of individual subjective experience on the one hand, and to preserve the truth of theory on the other. Even dialectical progress is put into doubt: "its truth or untruth is not inherent in the method itself, but in its intention in the historical process." This intention must be oriented toward integral freedom and happiness: "The only philosophy which can be responsibly practiced in face of despair is the attempt to contemplate all things as they would present themselves from the standpoint of [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]]." Adorno goes on to distance himself from the "optimism" of orthodox Marxism: "beside the demand thus placed on thought, the question of the reality or unreality of redemption [i.e. human emancipation] itself hardly matters."&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W. (2006), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a sociological point of view, both Horkheimer's and Adorno's works contain a certain ambivalence concerning the ultimate source or foundation of social domination, an ambivalence that gave rise to the "pessimism" of the new critical theory over the possibility of human emancipation and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T. W., with Max Horkheimer. (2002). ''Dialectic of Enlightenment''. Trans. Edmund Jephcott. Stanford: Stanford University Press, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; This ambivalence was rooted, of course, in the historical circumstances in which the work was originally produced, in particular, the rise of [[National Socialism]], [[state capitalism]], and [[mass culture]] as entirely new forms of social domination that could not be adequately explained within the terms of traditional Marxist sociology.&lt;ref&gt;"Critical Theory was initially developed in Horkheimer's circle to think through political disappointments at the absence of revolution in the West, the development of Stalinism in Soviet Russia, and the victory of fascism in Germany. It was supposed to explain mistaken Marxist prognoses, but without breaking Marxist intentions" – Habermas, Jürgen. (1987). ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures''. Trans. Frederick Lawrence. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, p. 116.{{pb}}See also: Dubiel, Helmut. (1985). ''Theory and Politics: Studies in the Development of Critical Theory''. Trans. Benjamin Gregg. Cambridge, Massachusetts and London.&lt;/ref&gt; For Adorno and Horkheimer, [[Economic interventionism|state intervention]] in the economy had effectively abolished the tension in capitalism between the "[[relations of production]]" and "material [[productive forces]] of society"—a tension that, according to traditional [[Marxist theory]], constituted the primary contradiction within capitalism. The previously "free" market (as an "unconscious" mechanism for the distribution of goods) and "irrevocable" [[private property]] of Marx's epoch have gradually been replaced by the [[Planned economy|centralized state planning]] and socialized ownership of the [[means of production]] in contemporary Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;"[G]one are the objective laws of the market which ruled in the actions of the entrepreneurs and tended toward catastrophe. Instead the conscious decision of the managing directors executes as results (which are more obligatory than the blindest price-mechanisms) the old law of value and hence the destiny of capitalism." – Horkheimer, Max and Theodor Adorno. (2002). ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The dialectic through which Marx predicted the emancipation of modern society is thus suppressed, effectively being subjugated to a positivist rationality of domination.

Of this second "phase" of the Frankfurt School, philosopher and critical theorist Nikolas Kompridis writes that:

{{quote|According to the now canonical view of its history, Frankfurt School critical theory began in the 1930s as a fairly confident interdisciplinary and materialist research program, the general aim of which was to connect normative social criticism to the emancipatory potential latent in concrete historical processes. Only a decade or so later, however, having revisited the premises of their philosophy of history, Horkheimer and Adorno's ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' steered the whole enterprise, provocatively and self-consciously, into a skeptical cul-de-sac. As a result they got stuck in the irresolvable dilemmas of the "philosophy of the subject," and the original program was shrunk to a negativistic practice of critique that eschewed the very normative ideals on which it implicitly depended.&lt;ref name="Kompridis, Nikolas. 2006, p. 256"&gt;Kompridis, Nikolas. (2006), p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kompridis argues that this "sceptical cul-de-sac" was arrived at with "a lot of help from the once unspeakable and unprecedented barbarity of European fascism," and could not be gotten out of without "some well-marked [exit or] {{lang|de|Ausgang}}, showing the way out of the ever-recurring nightmare in which Enlightenment hopes and Holocaust horrors are fatally entangled." However, this {{lang|de|Ausgang}}, according to Kompridis, would not come until later – purportedly in the form of Jürgen Habermas's work on the intersubjective bases of [[communicative rationality]].&lt;ref name="Kompridis, Nikolas. 2006, p. 256"/&gt;

====Philosophy of music====
Adorno, a trained classical pianist, wrote ''The Philosophy of Modern Music'' (1949), in which he, in essence, polemicizes against [[popular music]]―because it has become part of the culture industry of [[Advanced capitalism|advanced capitalist society]]{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} and the [[false consciousness]] that contributes to social domination. He argued that radical art and music may preserve the truth by capturing the reality of human suffering. Hence:

{{quote|What radical music perceives is the untransfigured suffering of man [...] The seismographic registration of traumatic shock becomes, at the same time, the technical structural law of music. It forbids continuity and development. Musical language is polarized according to its extreme; towards gestures of shock resembling bodily convulsions on the one hand, and on the other towards a crystalline standstill of a human being whom anxiety causes to freeze in her tracks [...] Modern music sees absolute oblivion as its goal. It is the surviving message of despair from the shipwrecked.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W. (2003) ''The Philosophy of Modern Music''. Translated into English by Anne G. Mitchell and Wesley V. Blomster. Continuum International Publishing Group, pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This view of [[modern art]] as producing truth only through the negation of traditional aesthetic form and traditional norms of beauty because they have become ideological is characteristic of Adorno and of the Frankfurt School generally. It has been criticized by those who do not share its conception of modern society as a false totality that renders obsolete traditional conceptions and images of beauty and harmony.

In particular, Adorno despised [[jazz]] and [[popular music]], viewing it as part of the [[culture industry]], that contributes to the present sustainability of capitalism by rendering it "aesthetically pleasing" and "agreeable". The British philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] saw Adorno as producing 'reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing that the American people are just as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a 'fetishized' commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine.'&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, R. ''The Uses of Pessimism: and the Danger of False Hope'' 2010, p. 89, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical theory and domination===
====Negative dialectics====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
With the growth of advanced industrial society during the [[Cold War]] era, critical theorists recognized that the path of capitalism and history had changed decisively, that the modes of oppression operated differently, and that the industrial [[working class]] no longer remained the determinate negation of capitalism. This led to the attempt to root the dialectic in an absolute method of negativity, as in Marcuse's ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'' (1964) and Adorno's ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' (1966). During this period the Institute of Social Research resettled in [[Frankfurt]] (although many of its associates remained in the United States) with the task not merely of continuing its research but of becoming a leading force in the sociological education and [[democratization]] of West Germany. This led to a certain systematization of the Institute's entire accumulation of empirical research and theoretical analysis.

During this period, Frankfurt School critical theory particularly influenced some segments of the [[left-wing politics|left wing]] and leftist thought, particularly the [[New Left]]. Herbert Marcuse has occasionally been described as the theorist or intellectual progenitor of the New Left. Their critique of technology, totality, teleology and (occasionally) civilization is an influence on [[anarcho-primitivism]]. Their work also heavily influenced intellectual discourse on [[popular culture]] and scholarly [[popular culture studies]].

More importantly, however, the Frankfurt School attempted to define the fate of reason in the new historical period. While Marcuse did so through analysis of structural changes in the [[labour (economics)|labor]] process under capitalism and inherent features of the [[methodology]] of [[science]], Horkheimer and Adorno concentrated on a re-examination of the foundation of critical theory. This effort appears in systematized form in Adorno's ''Negative Dialectics'', which tries to redefine dialectics for an era in which "philosophy, which once seemed obsolete, lives on because the moment to realize it was missed". Negative dialectics expresses the idea of critical thought so conceived that the apparatus of domination cannot co-opt it.

Its central notion, long a focal one for Horkheimer and Adorno, suggests that the [[original sin]] of thought lies in its attempt to eliminate all that is other than thought, the attempt by the subject to devour the object, the striving for [[identity (philosophy)|identity]]. This [[reduction (philosophy)|reduction]] makes thought the accomplice of domination. ''Negative Dialectics'' rescues the "preponderance of the object", not through a naïve [[Epistemological realism|epistemological]] or [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realism]] but through a thought based on [[differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]], [[paradox]], and ruse: a "logic of disintegration". Adorno thoroughly criticizes [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s fundamental [[ontology]], which he thinks reintroduces idealistic and identity-based concepts under the guise of having overcome the philosophical tradition.

''Negative dialectics'' comprises a monument to the end of the tradition of the individual subject as the locus of criticism. Without a revolutionary working class, the Frankfurt School had no one to rely on but the individual subject. But, as the [[liberalism|liberal]] capitalist social basis of the autonomous individual receded into the past, the dialectic based on it became more and more abstract.

====Habermas and communicative rationality====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
{{Main|Jürgen Habermas}}
Habermas's work takes the Frankfurt School's abiding interests in rationality, the human subject, [[democratic socialism]], and the dialectical method and overcomes a set of contradictions that always weakened critical theory: the contradictions between the materialist and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] methods, between Marxian social theory and the [[individualism|individualist]] assumptions of critical [[rationalism]] between technical and social rationalization, and between cultural and psychological phenomena on the one hand and the [[economics|economic]] structure of society on the other.

The Frankfurt School avoided taking a stand on the precise relationship between the materialist and transcendental methods, which led to ambiguity in their writings and confusion among their readers. Habermas's epistemology synthesizes these two traditions by showing that phenomenological and transcendental analysis can be subsumed under a materialist theory of [[social evolution]], while the materialist theory makes sense only as part of a quasi-transcendental theory of emancipatory knowledge that is the self-reflection of cultural evolution. The simultaneously empirical and transcendental nature of emancipatory knowledge becomes the foundation stone of critical theory.

By locating the conditions of rationality in the social structure of language use, Habermas moves the locus of rationality from the autonomous subject to subjects in [[Social interaction|interaction]]. Rationality is a property not of individuals per se, but rather of structures of undistorted [[communication]]. In this notion Habermas has overcome the ambiguous plight of the subject in critical theory. If capitalistic technological society weakens the autonomy and rationality of the subject, it is not through the domination of the individual by the apparatus but through technological rationality supplanting a describable rationality of communication. And, in his sketch of communicative [[ethics]] as the highest stage in the internal logic of the evolution of ethical systems, Habermas hints at the source of a new [[politics|political]] practice that incorporates the imperatives of evolutionary rationality.

==Criticism of Frankfurt School theorists==
===Horkheimer and Adorno's pessimism===
An early criticism, originating from the left, argues that Frankfurt School critical theory is nothing more than a form of "bourgeois idealism" devoid of any actual relation to political practice, and is hence totally isolated from the reality of any ongoing revolutionary movement. This criticism was captured in [[Georg Lukács]]'s phrase "Grand Hotel Abyss" as a syndrome he imputed to the members of the Frankfurt School:

{{quote|A considerable part of the leading German intelligentsia, including Adorno, have taken up residence in the ''Grand Hotel Abyss'' which I described in connection with my critique of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] as "a beautiful hotel, equipped with every comfort, on the edge of an abyss, of nothingness, of absurdity. And the daily contemplation of the abyss between excellent meals or artistic entertainments, can only heighten the enjoyment of the subtle comforts offered."&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, Georg. (1971). ''The Theory of the Novel''. MIT Press, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] equally believed that the school did not live up to Marx's promise of a better future:

{{quote|Marx's own condemnation of our society makes sense. For Marx's theory contains the promise of a better future. But the theory becomes vacuous and irresponsible if this promise is withdrawn, as it is by Adorno and Horkheimer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper|Karl R. Popper]]: ''Addendum 1974: The Frankfurt School.'' in: ''The Myth of the Framework.'' London New York 1994, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Habermas's solutions: critical theory "between past and future"===
In 2006, Nikolas Kompridis (who undertook a post-doctoral fellowship with Jürgen Habermas) published new criticisms of Habermas's approach to critical theory, calling for a dramatic break with the proceduralist ethics of communicative rationality. He writes:

{{quote|For all its theoretical ingenuity and practical implications, Habermas's reformulation of critical theory is beset by persistent problems of its own... In my view, the depth of these problems indicate just how wrong was Habermas's expectation that the paradigm change to linguistic intersubjectivity would render "objectless" the dilemmas of the philosophy of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen (1987), ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity'', MIT Press, 1987. p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas accused Hegel of creating a conception of reason so "overwhelming" that it solved ''too well'' the problem of modernity's [need for] self-reassurance.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen (1987), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; It seems, however, that Habermas has repeated rather than avoided Hegel's mistake, creating a theoretical paradigm so comprehensive that in one stroke it ''also'' solves too well the dilemmas of the philosophy of the subject ''and'' the problem of modernity's self-reassurance.&lt;ref&gt;Kompridis, Nikolas. (2006), pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition, he writes that:

{{quote|The change of paradigm to linguistic intersubjectivity has been accompanied by a dramatic change in critical theory's self-understanding. The priority given to questions of justice and the normative order of society has remodeled critical theory in the image of liberal theories of justice. While this has produced an important contemporary variant of liberal theories of justice, different enough to be a challenge to liberal theory, but not enough to preserve sufficient continuity with critical theory's past, it has severely weakened the identity of critical theory and inadvertently initiated its premature dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;Kompridis, Nikolas. (2006), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To prevent that dissolution, Kompridis suggests that critical theory should "reinvent" itself as a "possibility-disclosing" enterprise, incorporating Heidegger's controversial insights into [[world disclosure]] and drawing from the sources of normativity that he feels were blocked from critical theory by its recent change of paradigm. Calling for what [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] has named a "new department" of reason,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor, Philosophical Arguments pp. 12, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; with a possibility-disclosing role that Kompridis calls "[[reflective disclosure]]", Kompridis argues that critical theory must embrace its neglected [[German romanticism|German romantic inheritance]] and once again imagine alternatives to existing social and political conditions, "if it is to have a future worthy of its past."&lt;ref&gt;Kompridis, Nikolas. (2006), p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of psychoanalytic categorizations===
In an interview with Casey Blake and [[Christopher Phelps]], historian [[Christopher Lasch]] criticized the Frankfurt School's initial tendencies towards "automatically" rejecting opposing political criticisms on "psychiatric" grounds:

{{quote|''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' had a tremendous influence on [[Richard Hofstadter|Hofstadter]] and other liberal intellectuals, because it showed them how to conduct political criticism in psychiatric categories, to make those categories bear the weight of political criticism. This procedure excused them from the difficult work of judgment and argumentation. Instead of arguing with opponents, they simply dismissed them on psychiatric grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Casey and Christopher Phelps. (1994). "History as social criticism: Conversations with Christopher Lasch", ''Journal of American History'' 80, No. 4 (March), pp. 1310–1332&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Economic and media critiques===
During the 1980s, anti-authoritarian socialists in the United Kingdom and New Zealand criticised the rigid and determinist view of popular culture deployed within the Frankfurt School theories of capitalist culture, which seemed to preclude any prefigurative role for social critique within such work. They argued that [[EC Comics]] often did contain such cultural critiques.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Barker: ''A Haunt of Fears: The Strange History of the British Horror Comics Campaign'': London: Pluto Press: 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy Shuker, Roger Openshaw and Janet Soler: ''Youth, Media and Moral Panic: From Hooligans to Video Nasties'': Palmerston North: Massey University Department of Education: 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Recent criticism of the Frankfurt School by the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Cato Institute]] focused on the claim that culture has grown more sophisticated and diverse as a consequence of free markets and the availability of niche cultural text for niche audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Cowen, Tyler (1998) "Is Our Culture in Decline?"

The conspiracy theory emerged in the late 1990s. It suggested that the Frankfurt School and other marxist theorists were working in a conspiracy to control and stage their own attack on Western society, using [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]], [[multiculturalism]], [[progressive politics]] and [[political correctness]] as their methods.&lt;ref name=Berkowitz&gt;{{cite news |last1=Berkowitz |first1=Bill |title='Cultural Marxism' Catching On |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2003/cultural-marxism-catching |accessdate=October 2, 2018 |work=Intelligence Report |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |date=August 15, 2003 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930043851/https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2003/cultural-marxism-catching |archivedate=September 30, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lind" /&gt; This conspiracy theory is associated with American religious paleoconservatives such as [[William S.

In 1999, Lind led the creation of an hour-long program entitled "Political Correctness: The Frankfurt School".&lt;ref name="Jay" /&gt;

The historian [[Martin Jay]] commented on this phenomenon saying that Lind's original documentary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;spawned a number of condensed textual versions, which were reproduced on a number of radical right-wing sites. These in turn led to a welter of new videos now available on YouTube, which feature an odd cast of pseudo-experts regurgitating exactly the same line. The message is numbingly simplistic: all the ills of modern American culture, from feminism, [[affirmative action]], [[sexual liberation]] and [[gay rights]] to the decay of traditional education and even [[environmentalism]] are ultimately attributable to the insidious influence of the members of the Institute for Social Research who came to America in the 1930's.&lt;ref name="Jay" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heidi Beirich likewise holds that the conspiracy theory is used to [[demonize]] various conservative "[[wikt:bête noire#English|bêtes noires]]" including "feminists, homosexuals, [[secular humanist]]s, multiculturalists, [[Sex education|sex educators]], environmentalists, immigrants, and [[black nationalist]]s".&lt;ref name="PERRY"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perry|first1=Barbara (ed.)|last2=Beirich|first2=Heidi|title=Hate crimes [vol.5]|date=2009|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-275-99569-0|pages=119|url=https://books.google.com/?id=M7p6TDR1zwcC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Heidi+Beirich+Cultural+Marxism#v=onepage&amp;q=noires&amp;f=false|access-date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Chip Berlet]], who specializes in the study of [[far-right]] movements, the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory found a place within the [[Tea Party movement]] of 2009, with contributions published in the ''[[American Thinker]]'' and ''[[WorldNetDaily]]'' highlighted by some Tea Party websites.&lt;ref name="Collectivists"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://crs.sagepub.com/content/38/4/565.abstract |title=Collectivists, Communists, Labor Bosses, and Treason: The Tea Parties as Right-Wing Populist Counter-Subversion Panic |author=Berlet, Chip |journal=Critical Sociology |date=July 2012 |volume=38 |pages=565–587 |doi=10.1177/0896920511434750 |issue=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115213944/http://crs.sagepub.com/content/38/4/565.abstract |archivedate=15 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KIMBALL"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kimball|first1=Linda|title=Cultural Marxism|url=http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2007/02/cultural_marxism.html|website=American Thinker|access-date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this speech Lind noted that all the members of The Frankfurt School were "to a man, Jewish", but it is reported that Lind claims not to question whether the Holocaust occurred and suggests he was present in an official capacity for the Free Congress Foundation "to work with a wide variety of groups on an issue-by-issue basis".&lt;ref name="BERK"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berkowitz|first1=Bill|title=Ally of Christian Right Heavyweight Paul Weyrich Addresses Holocaust Denial Conference|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2002/ally-christian-right-heavyweight-paul-weyrich-addresses-holocaust-denial-conference|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|publisher=SPLC 2003|access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BILL" /&gt;

McMaster]] from the [[United States National Security Council]] following the discovery of a seven-page memorandum he had authored, describing a conspiracy theory concerning a plot to destroy the presidency of [[Donald Trump]] by Cultural Marxists, as well as [[Islamist]]s, [[globalist]]s, bankers, the media, and members of the Republican and Democratic parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/13/donald-trump-white-house-steve-bannon-rich-higgins|title=How Trump's paranoid White House sees 'deep state' enemies on all sides|date=13 August 2017|publisher=''The Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/10/heres-the-memo-that-blew-up-the-nsc/|title=Here's the Memo That Blew Up the NSC |date=10 August 2017|publisher=''Foreign Policy''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/a-national-security-council-staffer-is-forced-out-over-a-controversial-memo/535725/|title=An NSC Staffer Is Forced Out Over a Controversial Memo|date=2 August 2017|publisher=''The Atlantic''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, the [[Twitter]] account of [[Ron Paul]] posted and then deleted a cartoon about Cultural Marxism which depicted racial stereotypes.

Philosopher and political science lecturer Jérôme Jamin has stated that "[n]ext to the global dimension of the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory, there is its innovative and original dimension, which lets its authors avoid racist discourses and pretend to be defenders of democracy".&lt;ref name="JAMIN"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Shekhovtsov |editor1-first=A. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |last=Jamin |first=Jérôme |title=The Post-War Anglo-American Far Right: A Special Relationship of Hate |chapter=Cultural Marxism and the Radical Right |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |isbn=978-1-137-39619-8 |doi=10.1057/9781137396211.0009 |pages=84–103 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbLSBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA84 |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor and [[Oxford fellow]] Matthew Feldman has traced the terminology back to the pre-war German concept of [[Cultural Bolshevism]], locating it as part of the [[degeneration theory]] that aided in [[Hitler's rise to power]].&lt;ref name="MATT"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthew|first1=Feldman|last2=Griffin|first2=Roger (editor)|title=Fascism: Fascism and culture|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-29018-0 |page=343|edition=1. publ.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOH4yTFvBokC&amp;pg=PA343&amp;lpg=PA343&amp;dq=Cultural+Marxism|access-date=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; William S.

'''Generation YES''' ('''Youth and Educators Succeeding'''), is a U.S. non-profit organization that works with schools around the world to empower underserved students and ensure that technology investments in education are both cost effective and meaningful. [[Dennis Harper]] is the founder and CEO. Generation YES programs focus on [[student-centered learning|student centered]], [[project-based learning]] "experiences that impact student's lives and increase student involvement in school and community through the use of technology. In addition, all Generation YES programs improve the use of technology in the school as a whole."

==History==
Generation YES was founded by Dr. Dennis Harper in 1995 when he was a technology director for the [[Olympia, Washington]] school district. He wrote a government [[Technology Innovation Challenge Grant]] proposal to develop an initiative to involve children in the acceptance of technology in curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://genyes.com/about/history |title=GenYES History and Philosophy |work=Generation YES |date=n.d. |accessdate=2007-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318081639/http://genyes.com/about/history |archivedate=2007-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The grant was approved in 1996 for five years, concluding in 2001.&lt;ref name="cnet200604"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.cnet.com/2009-1041_3-6065108.html | title = When digital kids rule the classroom | author = Stefanie Olsen | work = [[CNET]] News.com | date = April 26, 2006 | accessdate = 2007-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the organization is a 501(c)(3) supported by schools and partnerships with other organizations to develop customized student technology programs.&lt;ref name="cnet200604"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.techlearning.com/db_area/archives/TL/2003/06/morewithless.php | title = Great Expectations, Limited Resources: 12 Tips on Doing More with Less | author = Gwen Solomon | work = TechLearning | date = June 16, 2003 | accessdate = 2007-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Programs==
Today, Generation YES provides [[K-12]] schools across the U.S. with two foundational programs. GenYES (originally known as Generation www.Y and Generation WHY) has students assist teachers as they integrate technology in classrooms. These students are denoted as Student Technology Leaders. Student Technology Leaders are then partnered with teachers to support efforts to integrate technology in classrooms by doing hardware and software support and even designing professional development.&lt;ref name="usatoday200108"&gt;{{cite news | url  = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2001-08-06-students-tutor-teachers.htm | title = Students tutor teachers in tech | date =  August 6, 2001 | author = Karen Thomas | work = [[USA Today]] | accessdate = 2007-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://genyes.com/programs/genyes/ GenYES]. Generation YES website. Retrieved 7/13/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

TechYES focuses on students completing project-based learning activities demonstrating their [[technology literacy]] and [[Common Core]] competency. In this program, Student Technology Leaders assist other students with the technology elements and initial assessments of projects.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://genyes.com/programs/techyes TechYES]. Generation YES website. Retrieved 7/13/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Generation YES, more than 1,000 schools are currently using their programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://genyes.com/about | title = About GenYES | work = Generation YES | date = n.d. | accessdate = 2007-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
In 2000, GenYES was awarded one of two "Exemplary" designations by the [[U.S. Department of Education]] (ED) Educational Technology Expert Panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/ORAD/LTD/newtech_progs.html#genwwwy |title=Exemplary &amp; promising educational technology programs (2000) |date=September 8, 2000 |work=Learning Technologies Division, Office of Educational Research and Improvement, U.S. Department of Education |accessdate=2006-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060102062818/http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/ORAD/LTD/newtech_progs.html#genwwwy |archivedate=2006-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ED then wrote a publication about Generation YES and its status, reporting that,

:Reviewers were impressed by the creativity of [GenYES in] creating a [[role reversal]] in which students help support the school's technology infrastructure and partner with teachers in curriculum development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov/pubs/edtechprograms/generationy.pdf |title=Generation www.Y: Exemplary and Promising Educational Technology Programs 2000 |date=March 15, 2002 |work=Learning Technologies Division, Office of Educational Research and Improvement, U.S. Department of Education |accessdate=2006-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112045128/http://www.ed.gov/pubs/edtechprograms/generationy.pdf |archivedate=2006-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Generation YES was named "Rookie of the Year" at the [[EdNET]] Industry Awards. Founder [[Dennis Harper]] has also received numerous accolades due to his work related to Generation YES.

The company and its programs have been featured in numerous important education publications, technology industry magazines, and [[academic journal]]s. ''[[Edutopia]]'', a respected [[Educational progressivism|progressive education]] magazine published by the George Lucas Educational Foundation, has interviewed a www.Y program support specialist in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edutopia.org/php/interview.php?id=Art_815 | title = James Smith on Teacher Preparation | author = James L.

The '''history of [[Durham University]]''' spans over 180 years since it was founded by Act of Parliament. [[King William IV]] granted [[Royal Assent]] to the Act on 4 July 1832, and granted the university a [[Royal Charter]] on 1 June 1837, incorporating it and confirming its constitution.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The university awarded its first degrees on 8 June 1837. It claims to be the [[Third-oldest university in England debate|third-oldest university in England]] (a claim also made by [[University College London|UCL]] and the [[University of London]]) and is, according to the [[European University Association]]'s ''[[A History of the University in Europe]]'', one of the oldest hundred universities in continuous operation in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the University in Europe|volume=3|page=3|author=Walter Rüegg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=entlN4EEPUYC&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=16 September 2004|quote= "In 1789 [Europe] was filled with 143 universities.

[[File:Martin Archer Shee - King William IV - c.1800.jpg|thumb|right|[[King William IV]] who granted [[Durham University]] its [[Royal Charter]] in 1837]]

The direct involvement of [[Durham Cathedral]] with higher education dates back to the foundation c. 1286 of Durham Hall at Oxford, where the monks of Durham Abbey could go to study at the [[University of Oxford]]. This was endowed by Bishop [[Thomas Hatfield]] of Durham c. 1380 to become [[Durham College, Oxford]], consisting of eight monks (one of whom served as Warden) and eight secular scholars. This College remained a cell of Durham Abbey rather than becoming an independent foundation. At the [[Reformation]] in 1540 it was dissolved and its revenues passed to the new dean and chapter of the reformed Durham Cathedral. In 1541, [[Henry VIII]] proposed founding a northern University in Durham, but the plans were scaled down from a college with a provost and professors of divinity, Greek, Hebrew and medicine to a grammar school with a headmaster and an assistant master paid from Cathedral funds. There was a brief attempt to continue the college in Oxford as a secular foundation, but this lasted less than a year. The site was sold to [[Sir Thomas Pope]] in 1555 and used to found [[Trinity College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Fowler1904"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/durhamuniversity00fowluoft|title=Durham university; earlier foundations and present colleges|author=J.

Key dates|publisher=Durham University|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next attempt to establish a University in Durham was under [[Oliver Cromwell]]. In 1649 the cathedrals of England were dissolved by Act of Parliament, leaving [[Durham Castle]] (the Bishop's palace), the Cathedral and the College (the [[cathedral close]]) unoccupied. A number of petitions were presented to Cromwell, who in 1657 issued [[letters patent]] incorporating [[Durham College (17th century)|Durham College]]. [[Philip Hunton]] was nominated as the provost, along with two preachers, four professors, four tutors, and four schoolmasters. The college was granted an endowment of lands formerly belonging to the Cathedral, along with the buildings of the College and the Cathedral library. However, the letters patent of 1657 did not give the college the powers of a university. A further petition was made to Cromwell in 1658, but nothing was done before he died. Oxford and Cambridge then petitioned his successor, [[Richard Cromwell]], in 1659 against any grant of university powers to the Durham college. The College was also opposed by [[George Fox]] and other Quakers as being an institute designed to prepare ministers. According to Fowler, "on April 22 [Richard Cromwell] directed that a grant which had been drawn up to make the College a University should not be sealed until further order".&lt;ref name="Fowler1904" /&gt; The restoration of the monarchy in 1660 saw the Cathedral chapter re-established and Durham College closed. However, the cause of education was not wholly forgotten, for Bishop [[John Cosin]] established his library on [[Palace Green]] a few years later, in 1669.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/university.calendar/volumei/2009.2010/historical_note.pdf|title=Historical Note|work=Durham University Calendar|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fowler1904" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Penny Cyclopædia"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7KsrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA2211|title=The Penny Cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|publisher=C.

In the first half of the 19th century, many elements came together. There was increasing interest in the theological training of the clergy, leading to the establishment of the private [[St Bees Theological College]] in west Cumberland in 1816 and [[University of Wales Lampeter|St David's College, Lampeter]] in Wales in 1822 by Bishop [[Thomas Burgess (bishop)|Thomas Burgess]], who was a prebendary of Durham. Burgess was succeeded as Bishop of St David's in 1825 by [[John Jenkinson (bishop)|John Banks Jenkinson]], who became Dean of Durham (in addition to his bishopric) in 1827. The secular [[University College London]] (UCL) was established in 1826: it was then operating under the name of London University, which had led to the foundation of the Anglican [[King's College London]] in 1829. In 1831 UCL had, like Cromwell's Durham College, had its attempt to gain University status blocked by Oxford and Cambridge, on the grounds that it wanted to offer degrees to people who were not members of the established church. A church university could not be opposed on these grounds, and schemes were drawn up in the late 1820s and 1830s for universities in York and Bath, both of which failed for lack of money.&lt;ref name=York&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I0bwU4DH-rwC&amp;pg=PA389&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Memoir of the Late Sir Robert Peel|date=1851|journal=The Living Age|volume=28|page=389|author=The Dean of York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bath&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/Media/CHC%2520Images/Vol%252009%2520-%252008.%2520Buchanan%2520-%2520Bath%2520-%2520University%2520City.pdf|author=R Angus Buchanan|title=Bath: University City|publisher=[[Bath Spa University]]}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also threats that the [[Whig Government 1830-1834|Whig government elected in 1830]] would seek to remove some of the wealth of the Church of England – of which Durham was one of the richest cathedrals – and that a UCL-like secular college would be established in Newcastle, as proposed by [[Thomas Michael Greenhow|Thomas Greenhow]] in 1831 (this led to the foundation of the [[Newcastle University Medical School|Newcastle upon Tyne School of Medicine and Surgery]] in 1834).&lt;ref name="Fowler1904" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thorp Correspondence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reed.dur.ac.uk/xtf/view?docId=ead/adm/cthorp.xml|title=Calendar of the Charles Thorp Correspondence| publisher=Durham University|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcastle timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/1834/history/timeline/ |title=History of the Medical School - Timeline |publisher=[[Newcastle University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508125140/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/1834/history/timeline/ |archivedate=8 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 1831 the idea of founding a University at Durham was revived by [[Charles Thorp]], a [[prebendary]] of Durham and domestic chaplain to [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]], the Prime Minister (and from December 1831 Archdeacon of Durham).&lt;ref name="Thorp DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB||wstitle=Thorp, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TVelW-WAKwkC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=127|title=The Church of England and the Durham Coalfield, 1810–1926|author=Robert Lee|date=2007|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 September the Chapter passed an Act officially founding "an academical institution"&lt;ref name="Durham University Commissioners 1863 Evidence p119"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of the year this was being advertised as the University of Durham.&lt;ref name="London Standard 14 Dec 1831"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://newspaperarchive.com/uk/middlesex/london/london-standard/1831/12-14/page-3 | publisher=London Standard | date=14 December 1831 | title=London Standard, 14 December 1831 | accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1832 [[William van Mildert]], the Bishop of Durham, introduced a bill in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] entitled "an Act to enable the Dean and Chapter of Durham to appropriate part of the property of their church to the establishment of a University in connection therewith". The two main effects of this bill were: (1) to establish a university as an eleemosynary (charitable) trust under the control of the Dean and Chapter of Durham as governors and trustees, and the Bishop of Durham as [[Visitor]]; (2) to allow part of the property of the Cathedral to be used to support this University. The bill was passed with the support of Earl Grey's government, and received Royal Assent on 4 July 1832, which is taken as the date of the university's foundation.&lt;ref name="Fowler1904" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thorp Correspondence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Durham Difference|author=Nigel Watson|date=2007|publisher=James &amp; James (Publishers) Ltd., London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years, 1832–1846==

===The opening of the university===

The university was intended from the start to be collegiate, and the foundation college was [[University College, Durham|University College]]. This was originally accommodated in the former Archdeacon's Inn, renamed University House (now Cosin's Hall).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/university.college/about/|title=About University College|publisher=[[University College, Durham]]|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the passing of the Act, a year was spent setting up the university and recruiting staff. The [[Durham University Library|library]] was established in January 1833 by a donation of 160 volumes from Van Mildert, with the Bishop's librarian, Rev. Patrick George, being named the university's first librarian. The library was housed in a gallery of Cousin's Library on Palace Green.&lt;ref name=DULibrary&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/library/library_history_early.pdf|title=A History of Durham University Library: Early History|publisher=Durham University|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 July the opening of the university in Michaelmas Term 1833 was announced, along with an almost complete list of staff.&lt;ref name="Fowler1904" /&gt;

The university opened on 28 October 1833 with 19 "scholars" and 18 "students" on the Bachelor of Arts course and 5 students on the theology licence course. The university was the first in England to introduce matriculation examinations, although these had been in use at the [[University of St Andrews]] and Marischal College, Aberdeen since the 1820s;&lt;ref name=Andrews2016&gt;{{cite web|url=https://universityhistories.com/2016/08/12/durham-university-last-of-the-ancient-universities-and-first-of-the-new-1831-1871|title=Durham University: Last of the Ancient Universities and First of the New (1831-1871)|date=12 August 2016|website=University Histories|publisher=Research Group on University History, [[University of Manchester]]|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first student to be matriculated was John Cundill. Shortly after the first students arrived, the "first calendar" was published, advertising the institution as the "University of Durham founded by Act of Chapter with the Consent of the Bishop of Durham 28 September 1831. Constituted a University by Act of Parliament 2nd and 3rd William IV., Sess. 1831-2."&lt;ref name="Fowler1904"/&gt; The university had three professors (all Anglican clergymen) at its opening: [[Hugh James Rose]] (Divinity and Ecclesiastical History), Henry Jenkyns (Greek and Classical Literature) and John Carr (Mathematics). This reflected the two BA honours courses in classics and mathematics (following Oxford and Cambridge) and the course in theology, leading to the Licence in Theology (LTh). There were also Readers in Law (William Gray), Medicine (William Cooke), History (Thomas Greenwood), Natural Philosophy (Charles Thomas Whitley) and Moral Philosophy (J. Miller), and Lecturers in Modern Languages (James Hamilton), and Chemistry and Mineralogy ([[James Finlay Weir Johnston]], [[FRSE]]).&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=" Fowler1904" /&gt; Unlike at Oxford and Cambridge, where the teaching was carried out by the colleges, the professors at Durham were expected to "have the charge of the studies in their respective departments and work as at Glasgow and the foreign Universities, and as they did at Oxford in old times".{{refn|Letter from Thorp to Van Mildert, 10 December 1831.&lt;ref name=Andrews2016/&gt;}}

Unfortunately, Carr died suddenly on 30 October, only two days after the university opened. The university went into mourning for fourteen days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iKFEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA471&amp;lpg=PA471&amp;output=html&amp;f=false|pages=471–472|title=Obituaries: Rev. John Carr|journal=The Gentleman's Magazine|volume=103|date=1833}}&lt;/ref&gt; George, the librarian, died on 13 January 1834, Whitley taking over that role in addition to his readership. Rose was also plagued by ill health and left in March. He became the second Principal of [[King's College London]] in 1836 but again only lasted around six months before ill health forced him from the post; he died in 1838 aged 43. After he left Durham, his brother, [[Henry John Rose]], filled in for the rest of the academic year, before returning to his fellowship at Cambridge.&lt;ref name="Fowler1904" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfkRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA449&amp;lpg=PA449&amp;output=html&amp;f=false|title=Clergy Deceased|page=449|journal=The Gentleman's Magazine|volume=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenkyns took over as acting professor of divinity, while remaining professor of Greek until 1839, when he was appointed professor of Greek permanently and made a canon of the Cathedral. [[Temple Chevallier]] came to Durham in 1834 to assist Jenkyns with the teaching of theology and Hebrew, and was appointed professor of mathematics, reader in Hebrew and Registrar to the university in 1835.&lt;ref name="Fowler1904" /&gt;

In early 1834, Thorp wrote to the bishops of the Church of England asking if they would accept holders of Durham degrees for ordination alongside those from Oxford and Cambridge. The answers were mostly positive, with only two bishops refusing: [[George Murray (bishop of Rochester)]] and [[Henry Phillpotts]] (bishop of Exeter and a canon of Durham Cathedral).&lt;ref name="Thorp Correspondence" /&gt; At the end of the 1833–34 academic year, George Selby Thomson became the first recipient of the LTh, which was available with only one year's study for those with degrees from Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin or Durham (as opposed to three years' study for non-graduates). Thomson had gained his BA at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] and took his MA in June 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Calendar of the University of Durham|publisher=[[Durham University]]|date=1844|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kt8NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;output=html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge University Calendar|date=1835|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pd4NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was originally an intention to offer a medical course similar to those at the London colleges, leading to the Licence of the [[Society of Apothecaries]]. However, there was insufficient demand to sustain the course, particularly after the opening of the medical school in Newcastle (1834), and lectures in medicine stopped after 1836.&lt;ref name=Andrews2016/&gt;

In March 1834, Thorp received a letter from John Burder, the Bishop's London secretary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6eANAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA303&amp;lpg=PA303&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Royal Kalendar, and Court and City Register for England, Scotland ...|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; checking whether the proceedings regarding the university in Chapter were in writing under their common seal and with the Bishop's signature,&lt;ref name="Thorp Correspondence" /&gt; Following this, an Act of Chapter on 4 April 1834 resolved "that the College established by Act of Chapter, 28th September 1831, be constituted a University".&lt;ref name="Durham University Commissioners 1863 Evidence p119" /&gt; On 20 July 1835 the dean and chapter passed a fundamental statute for the university. This established the University [[Academic senate|Senate]] and [[Convocation#University use|Convocation]], explicitly allowed the university to grant degrees (stating "that the degrees in the various faculties shall be conferred by the Warden in Convocation"), limited degrees to members of the established church, and gave the Senate (subject to the approval of Convocation) the right to make further regulations.&lt;ref name="Fowler1904" /&gt;

The publication of these statutes led to a letter to the York Herald accusing the university of deceit in claiming the right to offer degrees without actually possessing that right, and claiming that students had been transferred to Oxford because "when the time for degrees grew near, not a degree could the Durhamites confer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Durham University |work=York Herald |date=31 October 1835 |accessdate=16 January 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000498/18351031/016/0003| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A response in the Durham Advertiser from "Dunelmensis" pointed out that "[t]he time for conferring degrees has not yet arrived" and that therefore the supposed lack of any right to confer degrees was purely the opinion of the writer of the original letter, without any evidence to back it up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=To the Editor of the Durham Advertiser |work=Durham Advertiser|date=20 November 1835 |accessdate=16 January 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000612/18351120/017/0002|via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first final degree examinations were held in Easter term, 1836, although following the practice of Oxford at the time the students would not receive their degrees for another year. The examinations in 1836 saw Durham introduce the use of [[external examiner]]s to ensure comparability of its degrees with those of Oxford and Cambridge. This marked the start of the system of external examination that spread throughout British higher education and is still used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cuthbert|first=Mike|date=2003|url=http://www.ukcle.ac.uk/resources/assessment-and-feedback/cuthbert/|title=The external examiner: how did we get here?|work= Presentation to the UKCLE/ALT workshop on external examiners, 6 June 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518100020/http://www.ukcle.ac.uk/resources/assessment-and-feedback/cuthbert/|archive-date=18 May 2013|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Cundill became the first Durham student to gain first class honours, in mathematics, although he missed out on a [[double first]], taking second class honours in classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fd8NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;output=html|title=Durham University Calendar|date=1842|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrews2016/&gt;

On 21 February 1836, Van Mildert died. The funding for the university was not yet fully established – Van Mildert had been supporting it with £2,000 a year from his own income and had been working to get prebendal stalls attached to the professorships of divinity and classics and to the wardenship, but this was in the hands of the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] and not yet decided. He had also allowed the university the use of Durham Castle, but this again was not yet settled. Thirdly, the Royal Charter to incorporate the university was not yet granted. There was also a fear that the Whig government, now under [[Lord Melbourne]], would appoint a liberal bishop who might not support the idea of the exclusively Anglican University.&lt;ref name="Fowler1904"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Van Mildert, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new bishop was named as [[Edward Maltby]], a liberal and supporter of UCL who had read the prayer at the laying of its foundation stone (and, from its foundation in November 1836, a senator of the [[University of London]]). Before he was installed, the petition for the Royal Charter was submitted. On the legal advice of Sir [[Charles Wetherell]], it contained no explicit mention of degree awarding powers.&lt;ref name="Thorp Correspondence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Durham Royal Charter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/about/governance/charter/|title=About Durham University: Royal Charter|publisher=Durham University|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2a4QAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA216&amp;lpg=PA216&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Laying the Foundation Stone of the London University|journal=Christian Journal and Literary Register|volume=11|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Royal Charter===

In the event, Maltby "heartily entered into the scheme for the Durham University",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Maltby, Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with his support the university's [[Royal Charter]] was granted on 1 June 1837 by [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], incorporating "The Warden, Masters and Scholars of the University of Durham". While, following Wetherell's advice, this did not include explicit degree awarding powers, it stated that the fundamental statute passed by the dean and chapter (as governors of the university) in 1835 was "by virtue, and in pursuance of the trusts and powers in the said Act of Parliament, and of every other power enabling them in that behalf" and also that the university "shall have and enjoy all the property, rights, and privileges which are assured by the said Act [the University of Durham Act 1832] to the university therein contemplated and authorised; or are incident to a University established by our Royal Charter".&lt;ref name="Durham Royal Charter" /&gt;

The first students graduated a week after the grant of the charter, on 8 June 1837. At the same [[Congregation (university)|congregation]] the charter was accepted and the original seal of the university adopted (a [[Cuthbert|St Cuthbert's]] cross in a circle, the coat of arms not then having been granted).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shop.dur.ac.uk/item/HeritageCollection_HeritageRingSilver_251_0_177_0.html|title=Heritage Ring Silver|quote=This is a traditional signet ring, with the original University seal carved in relief from the metal.|accessdate=6 October 2015|publisher=Durham University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first honorary degree was awarded the Earl Grey in 1838.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

The examination period of 1837 saw the first examinations for the MA. This was a break with the tradition of the ancient universities, where the [[Oxbridge MA]] had come to be awarded on payment of a fee to all BAs of the required standing. Durham, by contrast, required a further year of study and the passing of an examination.&lt;ref name=WhitingNewspaper1937/&gt;

On 19 July 1837, [[Queen Victoria]], by an order of the [[Queen-in-Council]], granted the use of [[Durham Castle]], previously a palace of the Bishop of Durham, to the university.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fowler1904" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson2007" /&gt; University College moved into the castle, however the [[keep]] was ruinous and needed substantial reconstruction before it could be occupied. In the course of this renovation, the skeleton of a whale was discovered in the castle ruins, and a report on this made at the 1839 meeting of the [[British Association]]. It was originally claimed that these were the remains of a whale cast up on the shore of Co. Durham in 1661 and acquired by Bishop Cosin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=The Gentleman's Journal|title=Antiquarian Researchers - Whale in Durham Castle|date=1839|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1FdIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA526&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=526|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later admitted that the letter on which this claim was based was a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Gentleman's Journal|title=Minor Correspondence|date=1840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPRfAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA450&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=450|volume=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1837 also saw the university found the first course in engineering at any university institution in England, which opened in January 1838, led by Chevallier and Johnston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JNk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Education of Students in Civil Engineering and Mining at the University of Durham|work=The London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science|date=1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it was initially popular, with admissions exceeding those for Arts or Theology in 1839/40, this did not last. The course was too expensive for students and although leading industrialists supported it, employers did not give any credit for it; it closed a few years later due to falling student numbers, the last students being admitted in 1851.&lt;ref name="Fowler1904" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson2007"/&gt; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrews2016/&gt;

Johnston was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] on 15 June 1837. His sponsors included [[Charles Wheatstone]] and [[Michael Faraday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=78&amp;dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27Johnston%27%29|title= Johnston, James Finlay Weir|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 1839, Thorp was also elected a Fellow, his sponsors including Bishop Maltby (signing E.

In 1839 the [[Durham University Observatory]] was established. This opened in 1842 with an 8-foot (2.44&amp;nbsp;m) focal length equatorial-mount refractor with a 6.5 inch (17&amp;nbsp;mm) primary, built by H. Fraunhofer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kDdNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA325&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The history and antiquities of the county palatine of Durham|author=William Fordyce|date=1857|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was used, in particular, for [[sunspot]] observations through the 19th century, as well as for observations of minor planets and comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arnold Wolfendale|author-link=Arnold Wolfendale|date=December 1992|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society|publisher=[[Royal Astronomical Society]]|title=Durham and the New Astronomies|volume=33|page=312|bibcode=1992QJRAS..33..311W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=George Rochester|author-link=George Rochester|date=December 1980|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society|publisher=[[Royal Astronomical Society]]|title=The History of Astronomy in the University of Durham from 1835 TO 1939|volume=21|page=369|bibcode=1980QJRAS..21..369R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1839 also saw Thorp involved in establishing a diocesan teacher training college for men (later to be St Bede's College, now the [[College of St Hild and St Bede]]), with the first Master being John Cundill. This was originally proposed to be part of the university, and the dean and chapter approved a scheme in 1836, but this did not prove practical. The college opened in Framwellgate Moor in 1841 before moving to Leazes Road in 1847.&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HildBede&gt;{{cite book|url=http://issuu.com/communicationsoffice/docs/hildbededoc|title=The College of St Hild &amp; St Bede, Durham|publisher=College of St Hild &amp; St Bede|date=1979|author=Ian Booth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 June 1841 a further Order in Council transferred further estates to the university and attached [[canonry|canonries]] to the professorships of Divinity and Greek, while the professor of Mathematics (Chevallier) was made the professor of Mathematics and Astronomy. The wardenship of the university was (after the term of the current Warden, Charles Thorp) to be held ''ex officio'' by the [[Dean of Durham]], the revenues freed up to be used to establish a professorship in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fd8NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;output=html|title=Durham University Calendar|date=1842|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks after this order was made, John Edwards was appointed professor of Greek, the office having been vacant since Jenkyns' appointment as professor of Divinity in 1839.&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt;

On 18 May 1843 the university received a grant of arms:
{{Quote|Argent, a Cross Patee quadrate Gules ; a Canton Azure, charged with a Cheveron Or between three Lions rampant of the First, together with this Motto 'Fundamenta ejus super montibus Sanctis,'|author=J. T. Fowler|source=Durham University; earlier foundations and present colleges, quoting the official grant&lt;ref name="Fowler1904" /&gt;}}
These are alternatively described (bringing out the origin of the various elements) as "Argent S. Cuthbert's cross (formée quadrate) gules; on a canton the arms of Bishop Hatfield: Azure, a chevron or, between three lions rampant argent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treatise On Ecclesiastical Heraldry|author=John Woodward|date=1894|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CIASAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA444&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is interesting that Bishop Hatfield, the founder of Durham College, Oxford, is commemorated in the arms rather than Bishop Van Mildert. This was not the only attempt to draw a link between the college and the university. In an undated letter to "Mr Grey" (not the Earl), Thorp wrote:
{{Quote|The university is the legitimate successor of Durham College, the property of which remained since the reformation in the hands of the Chapter and which successive Governments from Henry VIII downwards have proposed to apply to academic education at Durham.|author=Charles Thorp, 1st Warden of Durham University&lt;ref name="Thorp Correspondence " /&gt;}} Early university calendars also contained a note setting out the link between the college and the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fd8NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;output=html|title=Durham University Calendar|date=1842|pages=1–2|quote=It is also a fact worthy of notice that the Dean and Chapter were endowed by Henry VIII, not only with the revenues of the Benedictine Priory at Durham, but also with those of the College connected with it in the University of Oxford. This College, though in existence at an earlier period, seems to have owed much of its prosperity to Bishops Richard de Bury and Hatfield, and, at the death of the latter prelate in 1381, is stated to have enjoyed a provision for 8 Fellows (one of whom was Warden or Prior), and 8 secular Scholars. It was dissolved at the Reformation on account of its connexion with the Priory of Durham; and its advowsons and other endowments were granted by Henry VIII to the new Dean and Chapter. This body, therefore, is the representative of the ancient College, as well as of the ancient Priory: and thus there is a peculiar fitness in their endeavour to replace the suppressed establishment for education in Oxford by the foundation of a new one of a similar nature at Durham.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting also that the head of the mediaeval Durham College was its Warden, the same title assumed by Thorp as head of the new University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jjqMN2G8fGoC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Heads of Religious Houses: England and Wales, III. 1377–1540|author1=David Knowles|author2=David M.

===Sports and societies===

1834 saw the foundation of the [[Durham Regatta]], the second oldest in the country. The university was one of the founding members of the Regatta, along with [[Durham School]] and Durham Boat Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Durham Regatta]]|accessdate=10 October 2015|title=Regatta History|url=http://www.durham-regatta.org.uk/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rrm.co.uk/exhibitions/previous-exhibitions/175-years-of-durham-university-rowing.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107012256/http://www.rrm.co.uk/exhibitions/previous-exhibitions/175-years-of-durham-university-rowing.aspx|publisher=River and Rowing Museum, Henley-on-Thames|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 January 2012|title=175 Years of Durham University Rowing|date=2008|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was represented by a crew from [[University College Boat Club (Durham)|University College Boat Club]] in the six-oared ''Sylph'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Castellum|date=2008|volume=61|title=Obituary: Martin Proctor|url=https://www.castlealumni.uk/files/castellum/Castellum%252061%2520(2008).pdf|page=10|publisher=Durham Castle Society}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; losing to W.

The first debating society in Durham was founded in 1835.

==Growth, crisis and revival: 1846–1909==

===New colleges in Durham===

In 1846, [[Thomas Hatfield|Bishop Hatfield]]'s Hall (later to become [[Hatfield College]]) was founded with the idea of providing more economical accommodation for students. While [[University College, Durham|University College]] had followed the system of the Oxbridge colleges, where students were expected to furnish their own rooms, employ their own servants, and buy their own food, David Melville, the first Master of Hatfield, proposed a "model college" based on three principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/hatfield.history/intour/model.htm|title=Hatfield College History: A Model College|accessdate=23 October 2015|publisher=Hatfield College}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* All rooms were let furnished, with shared servants
* All meals were taken in Hall, communally provided
* Commons were to be fixed at a reasonable rate, known in advance.

This system was discussed by the [[Royal Commission]] on the [[University of Oxford]] in 1852, who rejected it on the grounds that cheaper halls would provide worse tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1F1KAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA145&amp;lpg=RA1-PA145&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|journal=Edinburgh Review|volume=95–96|page=145|title=The Oxford University Commission Report|date=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was, however, taken up by [[Keble College, Oxford]] on its foundation in 1870,&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt; and has since spread throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Melville Building"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegiateway.org/news/2005-hatfield-melville-building|publisher=The Collegiate Way|title=Hatfield College (re)dedicates its Melville building|date=24 May 2005|author=R. J. O'Hara|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Melville was determined to create a brand new concept of student living and learning which would both meet the increasing demand for places and at the same time provide access to a university education for people of limited means. His dream became a reality and the model has been replicated across the world – there is a strong argument to say that university halls of residence as we know them today started in Hatfield College, Durham!|author=Tim Burt, Master of Hatfield College|source=quoted by Collegiate Way&lt;ref name="Melville Building" /&gt;}}

Hatfield's original building had been a coaching inn (the Red Lyon) in the 17th and 18th centuries. The College soon outgrew this and a new building (now the Melville building) was built in 1849 and a chapel was added in 1853.&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melville Building" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/hatfield.history/intour/|title=Hatfield College History|accessdate=23 October 2015|publisher=Hatfield College}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1851 saw the addition of a third College, Bishop Cosin's Hall, occupying University House on Palace Green (the old Archdeacon's Inn) where University College had first been based.&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt;

The new colleges and University College were all owned by the university, rather than (like the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge) being independent corporations. This has since been held up as an easier template for new collegiate foundations to follow than Oxbridge, and was the model used in establishing York, Lancaster and Kent as collegiate universities and in establishing residential colleges at US universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegiateway.org/news/2001-durham-example|title=The University of Durham Collegiate Example|date=25 July 2001|author=R.

Until the founding of Hatfield, the university and university college had been coextensive. This now changed, making it explicit that the teaching in Durham was carried out by the university, not (as in Oxford, Cambridge and London) partly by the colleges. This was not an innovation as such – it had been the older system at Oxford and Cambridge, who had been attacked around the time of Durham's foundation for abandoning it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjUeAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA384&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|journal=Edinburgh Review|pages=384–427|date=June 1831|title=Universities of England—Oxford|quote=It is thus not even pretended that Oxford now supplies more than the preliminary of an academical education. Even this is not afforded by the University, but abandoned to the Colleges and Halls; and the Academy of Oxford is therefore not one public University, but merely a collection of private schools. The University, in fact, exists only in semblance, for the behoof of the unauthorized seminaries by which it has been replaced, and which have contrived, under cover of is name, to slip into possession of is public privileges.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University Cricket Club was established in 1846, making it clear that it represented the whole University,&lt;ref name="DU Cricket Archives" /&gt; but Hatfield established its own Boat Club – which claims to have existed from 1846, although the first intercollegiate race was not held until 1854.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hatfieldcollegebc.com |publisher=Hatfield College Boat Club |accessdate=24 October 2015 |title=About the Club |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022630/http://www.hatfieldcollegebc.com/ |archivedate=17 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858, a diocesan teacher training college for women (later St Hild's College) opened on the Leazes Road site, next to the men's college.&lt;ref name=HildBede /&gt;

===The medical college===

In June 1851 the Newcastle upon Tyne School of Medicine and Surgery, which had opened on 1 October 1834, split into two following internal disagreements: the Newcastle upon Tyne College of Medicine and Surgery (supported by the majority of staff), and the Newcastle upon Tyne College of Medicine and Practical Science. Discussions between the university and the School of Medicine and Surgery had been in progress at the time of the split, and were renewed in October with the College of Medicine and Surgery, against vigorous opposition from the College of Medicine and Practical Science. On 17 December 1851, the College of Medicine and Surgery became the "Newcastle upon Tyne College of Medicine, in connection with the University of Durham", this being approved by Convocation on 27 January 1853.&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Durham University Calendar|date=1860|publisher=Durham University|page=159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-ANAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA159&amp;output=html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statutes of the university were amended on 20 November 1854 to remove religious tests from degrees, except those in arts and divinity, thus allowing degrees in medicine to be granted without religious distinction, although a religious test was still imposed on members of Convocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Durham University Calendar|date=1860|publisher=Durham University|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-ANAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PR10&amp;focus=viewport&amp;output=html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical connections were not made only with Newcastle. The medical schools of two Anglican colleges, [[King's College London]] and [[Queen's College, Birmingham]], were also affiliated to the university, allowing their students to obtain Durham degrees.&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=University of Durham|journal=Medical Times and Gazette|volume=2|date=22 September 1860|url=https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA281&amp;ei=kivyVIzbKerlsATIqYLgAQ&amp;id=5LZXAAAAMAAJ&amp;output=html|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Licences in Medicine were granted in 1856. In 1857 the College of Medicine and Practical Science merged back into the College of Medicine, and in 1858 the first University examinations for the Bachelor of Medicine degree were held, with external examiners from Oxford and London. Durham was included in the Medical Act 1858 with the same status as the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and London.&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt;

===The Commission of 1861===

The number of students in the university had peaked at 130 in the early 1850s and by 1861 had fallen to 46. The university was in crisis, and a Commission was set up by Act of Parliament in 1861 to look into it. Modern analysis has shown that much of this crisis was due to a stagnation in demand for higher education between the 1820s and the 1860s which, coupled with growth at Oxford and Cambridge, affected all of the newer institutions.&lt;ref name=Andrews2016/&gt;
 
One problem identified by the commission was Thorp, who ran the university as his private fiefdom. Melville, who had been dismissed as master of Hatfield in 1851, told the commission that:
{{Quote|during the whole of my experience there, I should say the Dean and Chapter were simply managed, the Convocation was simply dictated to, and the Senate simply checkmated; that is the Constitution of the University of Durham|author=David Melville|source=Report of the Durham University Commissioners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Durham university Commissioners|work=Accounts and Papers of the House of Commons|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCZcAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA63&amp;lpg=RA1-PA63&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The commission reported back in June 1862, recommending that the government of the university be removed from the dean and chapter and transferred to the senate, that a school of science be created, in which degrees in science would be awarded (the first science degrees in Britain having been awarded just two years earlier in 1860 by the [[University of London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOd3N6291CQC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The University of London, 1858–1900: The Politics of Senate and Convocation|author=Francis Michael Glenn Willson|date=2004|publisher=Boydell Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;), that the BA course be shortened to two years, and that arts degrees be opened to non-Anglicans. This was opposed by the dean and chapter, and the Privy Council rejected the recommendations. Thorp, now quite elderly, offered to retire, although he died in October 1862 before this could come into effect.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

Thorp had been warden since 1831 and master of University College since its opening. On his death, the Dean of Durham, as specified by the 1841 Order in Council, became warden ''ex officio''. The sub-warden, which had been a rotating position, became permanent and eventually evolved into the vice-chancellor. University College gained a separate master.&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt;

Despite rejecting the commission's recommendations, the dean and chapter proceeded to implement virtually all of them – except for their giving up control. New statutes in 1865 removed religious tests from all qualifications except licences and degrees in theology, although membership of Convocation remained closed to non-Anglicans until after the University Tests Act of 1871. The residence required for the BA degree was reduced to two years – although a "Student's Guide to the University of Durham" in 1880 recommended that, although it was possible to gain a pass degree in two years, "Candidates for honours should, if possible, allow themselves three years for the whole course". The length of the academic year was also increased from 6 months to 8.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Student's Guide to the University of Durham|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfkGAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=html&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0|publisher=Durham Advertiser|date=1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=University of Durham|work=Morning Post |date=18 September 1865 |accessdate=5 December 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000174/18650918/038/0006| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Cosin's Hall closed as a separate College in 1864, being merged into University College.&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt;

In order to give graduates of the university a voice, the Durham University Society (now the Dunelm Society) was formed in London as an independent alumni association. It held its first meeting on 31 May 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dunelm.org.uk/150th-anniversary|title=Celebrating 150 years of the Durham Alumni community|accessdate=16 January 2016|publisher=Durham University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The College of Physical Sciences===

An attempt was made to establish a school of sciences at Durham in 1865, but this came to nothing. In 1870 the Newcastle College of Medicine became a college of the university as the Durham University College of Medicine. It gained representation on the senate, and residence in the college now counted as residence in the university – so it was no longer necessary to live in Durham for a period to gain a degree.&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

In 1871 the university and the [[North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers]], led by [[Nicholas Wood]], established the College of Physical Sciences in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. £20,000 was raised by public subscription, and the university made an annual grant of £1,000, covering the salaries of professors in mathematics and physics. It originally granted the non-degree title of Associate in Science. The college was formally incorporated into the university in 1874, gaining the right to award the BSc and have representation in the Senate. The MSc (granting membership of Convocation) was added in 1878,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000289/18780824/007/0003|work=Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette|date= 24 August 1878|title=Clippings from the Athenaeum|via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the DSc in 1882.{{refn|Fowler gives dates of 1878 and 1882 in Chapter 2; Chapter 8 on the College of Science, by G. A. Labour, gives dates of 1881 and 1888&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Armstrong Jubilee"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Durham University Journal]]|title=The Jubilee of Armstrong College|pages=347–354|author=P. Phillips Bedson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GUxIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA347&amp;output=html|date=December 1921|volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College of Physical Sciences was the second provincial [[university college]] to be established, after [[Owens College]] in Manchester. From the start in 1871, the lecture and laboratory courses of the College were open to women, who were able to take the non-degree ASc but could not (at that time) proceed to degrees. However, the first women did not actually enter until 1880, when Isabel Aldis won an exhibition at the College.&lt;ref name="Armstrong Jubilee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="First Women 1880"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Durham University Journal|date=13 November 1880|title=The College of Physical Science|page=53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgAIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|volume=4|issue=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 the College of Physical Sciences was incorporated as a company under the name of the Durham College of Science. In 1886 land was acquired in Lax's Gardens for new buildings; construction started in 1887 with Sir W. G. Armstrong (later [[William George Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|Lord Armstrong]]) laying the foundation stone and the College moving to the new site in 1888.&lt;ref name="Armstrong Jubilee"/&gt; In 1889, the College of Science was one of 11 [[university colleges]] to be awarded funding through the "Grant to University Colleges in Great Britain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1889/aug/16/class-iv#S3V0339P0_18890816_HOC_256|title=Hansard|date=16 August 1889|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1886 also saw the College establish the first Chair of Mining in England, filled by John Herman Merivale who had been the College's first student 15 years earlier.&lt;ref name="Armstrong Jubilee"/&gt;

The curriculum was also expanded, with the School of Art merging into the College and the introduction of humanities subjects leading to the BLitt and DLitt from 1895 (the BA remaining limited to those studying at the Durham colleges). At the College of Medicine degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Hygiene (BHy and DHy) were introduced in 1891 and a diploma in public health in 1894. Unlike the Durham colleges, the two colleges in Newcastle were engaged in teaching and employed their own professors.&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt;

In 1904 the Durham College of Science was renamed Armstrong College in honour of Lord Armstrong, whose friends and admirers raised £50,000 for the College after his death, to be used to complete the buildings, on condition that the name be changed.&lt;ref name="Armstrong Jubilee"/&gt;

===Growth in Durham===

Back in Durham, "unattached" mature students were admitted from 1870: these were non-resident students who were not associated with a college. In 1888 the unattached students founded [[St Cuthbert's Society]].&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt; The men's teacher training college (named St Bede's College from 1886) was affiliated to the university from 1892, while the women's teacher training college was affiliated from 1896, in which year it was also renamed St Hild's College.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HildBede /&gt;

The university also formed overseas links with two Anglican institutions: [[Codrington College]] in [[Barbados]] in 1875 and [[Fourah Bay College]] in [[Sierra Leone]] in 1876. Via the latter of these, Durham awarded what was probably the first BA in Africa to Nathaniel Davis in 1878.&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Durham First|publisher=Durham University|volume=33|date=January 2013|page=10|url=http://issuu.com/durhamfirst/docs/durham_first_issue_33_jan_2013/10|title=Durham University's alumni magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[London Times|Times]] said "it would not be much longer before the University of Durham was affiliated to the Zoo",&lt;ref name=FBC&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rebuilding the Athens of West Africa: Education in the 21st Century in Sierra Leone|url=http://www.thejournalofsierraleonestudies.com/downloads/Version2.pdf|journal=Journal of Sierra Leone Studies|volume=1|edition=2|pages=1–17|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although Durham was proud of what it was doing, the reaction in Sierra Leone was more mixed:
{{Quote|it will be no little credit to the University of Durham for history to have to record that she was the first to throw open to Africa the full privileges of a liberal education.’|source=Durham University Journal, 1876&lt;ref name=FBC /&gt;}}
{{Quote|The affiliation of FBC to Durham University elicited mixed reactions. On the one hand, it provided FBC with the prestige of conferring a British degree. On the other hand, it fell far short of being a West African university staffed with African faculty capable of addressing and embracing West African language, tradition and culture. … Amidst strong demands for a truly West African university, the affiliation was a compromise.|author=Daniel J. Paracka Jr.|source=The Athens of West Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_1iTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Athens of West Africa: A History of International Education at Fourah Bay College, Freetown, Sierra Leone|publisher=
Routledge|date=1 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also in 1876 the university passed regulations allowing the affiliation of theological colleges, allowing students who obtained their licences to proceed to a Durham BA with only 1 year of residence and only sitting the final examination.&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt; Affiliated colleges in 1882 were: [[St Aidan's College, Birkenhead]], [[St Augustine's College, Canterbury]], [[St Bees Theological College]], [[Chichester Theological College]], [[Great Cumbrae|Cumbrae Theological College]], [[Edinburgh Theological College]], [[Gloucester]] Theological College, [[St John's College, Nottingham|Highbury Theological College]], [[Lichfield Theological College]], [[Lincoln Theological College]], [[St Boniface Missionary College, Warminster]], and the theological departments of [[King's College London]] and [[Queen's College, Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Durham University Calendar|year=1882|url=https://books.google.com/books?output=html&amp;id=2eANAAAAQAAJ&amp;jtp=32|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, the university celebrated its golden jubilee with the award of forty honorary degrees, including a DD for John Cundill, the installation of a stained glass window designed by [[Charles Eamer Kempe|C E. Kempe]] in the great hall of the castle, a concert, and services in the cathedral, where Bishop [[Joseph Lightfoot|Lightfoot]] preached.&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eZwyC18W1fkC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=73|title=Durham Castle: Fortress, Palace, College|author=Richard Brickstock|publisher=Jeremy Mills Publishing|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Richard de Bury|work=Leaders of the Northern Church|author=Joseph Lightfoot|author-link=Joseph Lightfoot|pages=

===Women students===

The university had originally voted to admit women in 1881, only three years after London had done so. However, implementation was delayed by disputes over who would pay for a women's college – the university did not have the money, and (unlike at Oxford and Cambridge) private backers were not forthcoming. A further blow was dealt in 1886 when the university sought a legal opinion and discovered it did not have the right under its current charter to grant degrees to women.

Women were, however, allowed to study at the College of Science from its opening in 1871,&lt;ref name="Armstrong Jubilee"/&gt; although the first women did not enter until 1880,&lt;ref name="First Women 1880"/&gt; and it had over thirty women students by 1893.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;  
The situation was allowed to rest for a while, until in 1892 Ella Bryant passed the BSc examination with second class honours in physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amtGAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=Ella+bryant&amp;hl=en&amp;output=html_text&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FffSVNnhCdHbsASzvIDICg&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Ladies in the Laboratory? American and British Women in Science, 1800–1900|author=Mary R. S. Creese|publisher=Scarecrow Press|date=1 January 2000|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1893 she tried to pay the fee for the BSc degree, but was refused. The university applied for a supplemental charter "almost immediately" after this, allowing it to grant degrees to women in all subjects but divinity, and it was granted in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA152&amp;ei=WffSVKCQJ-GHsQSlwYKgBQ&amp;id=9FABAAAAYAAJ&amp;output=html|page=152|title=Education of Girls and Women in Great Britain|author=Christina Sinclair Bremner|publisher=Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Company, Limited|date=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant received her BSc on 24 June 1895, becoming the first woman to receive a degree from Durham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA286&amp;id=luA1AQAAMAAJ&amp;output=html|title=University of Durham: Degrees for Women|journal=Edinburgh Medical Journal|page=268|date=September 1895|volume=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first women to matriculate in Durham itself were three women from St Hild's College and two "Home Students" (later to be organised as St Aidan's Society, now [[St Aidan's College, Durham|St Aidan's College]]). The Hild students were the first to gain degrees, graduating with BLitts in 1898. The first BA followed in 1899, being awarded to a "Miss Thomas", a member of staff at St Hild's, who also went on to become the first woman MA in 1902, although women were not admitted to Convocation until 1913.&lt;ref name=HildBede /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stmaryscollegesociety.co.uk/history/|title=History of the College|publisher=SR Mary's College Society|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 the Women's Hostel (now [[St Mary's College, Durham|St Mary's College]]) was founded on Claypath, moving to the Abbey House on Palace Green in 1901.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt; Once it had the supplemental charter, Durham went further than other universities in opening up courses not only in Arts and Science but also in medicine, the College of Medicine becoming the first mixed medical school in England. In 1900 women could study medicine in England at Durham or the [[London School of Medicine for Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKcMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;output=html&amp;f=false|work=Englishwoman's Year Book|date=1900|page=106|title=Medical Training}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1901, the London School of Medicine for Women was affiliated to Durham, enabling students there to take Durham degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pVMBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;outpit=html&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=London School of Medicine for Women|page=39|work=Handbook of British, Continental and Canadian Universities, with Special Mention of the Courses Open to Women.

===New colleges===

Durham graduate [[Thomas Wilkinson (bishop of Hexham and Newcastle)|Thomas Wilkinson]] became [[Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle]] in 1889 and president of the Catholic seminary, [[Ushaw College]], near Durham, in 1890. Ushaw had been affiliated to the [[University of London]] since 1840, but in 1900 became affiliated to Durham for a decade, before reverting to London following Wilkinson's death.&lt;ref name=Fowler1904 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/u/ushaw_college.html|title=Ushaw College|work=Catholic Encyclopaedia|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Durham Heritage Centre.jpg|left|thumb|[[St Chad's College]], one of the two independent colleges]]
At the start of the 20th century, the university thus consisted of a college, a hall and a women's hostel in Durham, all owned by the university, along with non-collegiate men in St Cuthbert's Society and "home" women students, all taught centrally by the university; two affiliated teacher training colleges in Durham sending students to University lectures; a medical college in Newcastle; and a government-funded university college in Newcastle.

In 1904 an independent Anglican foundation, St Chad's Hall (now [[St Chad's College]]), was established in Durham and licensed as a hall of residence. This was linked to St Chad's Hostel, established in Doncaster in 1902 in the Anglo-Catholic tradition to prepare students to enter theological colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcr.stchads.ac.uk/about_History.php|title=History|publisher=St Chad's College MCR|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 this was joined by another Anglican foundation, St John's Hall (now [[St John's College, Durham|St John's College]]), established by [[St John's College, Nottingham|St John's Theological College]] in Highbury, in the Evangelical tradition.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7BXjYdOs2VYC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;output=html&amp;f=false|pages=79–80|title=Nineteenth-century Anglican Theological Training: The Redbrick Challenge|author=David A. Dowland|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional stresses===

The first Student Representative Council (SRC) in the university was formed in the late 19th century in the College of Medicine. The Durham Colleges SRC was formed around 1900 using the College of Medicine SRC as a model. The Durham University SRC, with equal representation for the Durham Colleges, Armstrong College and the College of Medicine, was formed in 1907.&lt;ref name=DSU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reed.dur.ac.uk/xtf/view?docId=ead/uni/undg.xml#UNDall-3293|title=DC (from 1963 DU) Students Representative Council (SRC), later Students Union (DSU)|work=Durham University Records: Associations and Societies|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitutional arrangements were put under severe strain by the growth of the Newcastle colleges, which outnumbered the Durham colleges three to one, and the movement of the other provincial university colleges to independent university status from 1900. A new arrangement was proposed by Armstrong's principal, [[Sir Isambard Owen]], in 1907. This would have made the Newcastle colleges self-governing; transferred the government from the dean and chapter to the Senate (as had been proposed in 1862), replaced the warden by a chancellor appointed by the Senate; given Durham and Newcastle equal representation in the Senate; stripped Convocation of its veto; and opened the possibility of transferring the seat of the university to Newcastle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The University Review|volume=5|pages=49–50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bc2gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Durham|date=April 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last two items, in particular, proved contentious, and the necessary bill was blocked in parliament until a compromise could be reached. This was that the graduates gained increased representation on the Senate, Convocation (rather than Senate) would appoint the chancellor, and the seat of the university was fixed in Durham.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

The Durham University Act, enabling new statutes to be drawn up, received Royal Assent in April 1908, and the new statutes themselves were finally agreed and approved by the Privy Council in November 1909, transforming Durham into a federal university.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

After the new statues were approved, [[George William Kitchin]], dean of Durham and formerly the warden, became the first chancellor of the university, and the sub-warden ([[Frank Byron Jevons]], also principal of Hatfield) became the first [[vice-chancellor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reed.dur.ac.uk/xtf/view?docId=ead/uni/undc.xml#qxj-396|title=Vice-Chancellor and Warden|work=Durham University Records: Central Administration and Officers|publisher=Durham University|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university property in Durham was passed to the newly formed Council of Durham Colleges – representing only University College, Hatfield Hall, and the Women's Hostel.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt; The first President of the Council of Durham Colleges was [[George Nickson]], then suffragan Bishop of Jarrow and later Bishop of Bristol, who served 1910 – 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bishop of Bristol |work=Western Morning News |date=19 December 1932 |accessdate=15 March 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000329/19321219/082/0006| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[John Stapylton Grey Pemberton]], who served until the changes of the University's constitution in 1937 and was also Vice-Chancellor 1918 – 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Portrait Presentation at Durham |work=Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette |date=17 February 1937 |accessdate=15 March 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000640/19370217/160/0007| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Death at Durham of Mr J.

New regulations allowed students at Armstrong College to take a "Modern B.A.", while Durham division students whose BA included Latin and Greek could add "in litteris antiquis" after their degree. Provision was also made for the affiliation of Sunderland Technical College (now [[Sunderland University]]) once it reached a sufficient standard, and any other college in the counties of Durham, Northumbria, Cumberland and Westmoreland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Durham University Calendar|date=1910|publisher=Durham University|url=https://archive.org/details/calendar1011durhuoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, women were admitted to Convocation.&lt;ref name=MarysHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmaryscollegesociety.co.uk/history/|publisher=St Mary's College Society|title=History of the College|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First World War]] saw 2,500 students and staff serve, and 325 killed. Many buildings were requisitioned in both Durham and Newcastle, and the number of students dropped so low that the university had to deny it was closing. The finances of both the Durham Colleges and Armstrong College were, however, perilously low, leading to an appeal to the government for assistance.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

===Post-World War One expansion===

In 1919, Bishop Hatfield's Hall became Hatfield College,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/hatfield.history/intour/masters.htm|title=Hatfield College History: Principals &amp; Masters|publisher=Hatfield College|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Bede's was licensed as a Hall of Residence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=College of the Venerable Bedr|url=http://reed.dur.ac.uk/xtf/view?docId=ead/uni/undf.xml#UNDall-5688a|work=Durham University Records: Colleges|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and St Chad's and St John's both adopted the style of independent colleges. In 1920 the Women's Hostel became St Mary's College and moved into a former prebendal house in The College (now home to the [[Choristers School]]).&lt;ref name=MarysHistory /&gt; St John's and St Chad's were both formally made "constituent colleges" of the university in 1923, and St Hild's was licensed as a Hall of Residence.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Hild's College|url=http://reed.dur.ac.uk/xtf/view?docId=ead/uni/undf.xml#UNDall-5688b|work=Durham University Records: Colleges|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 [[Durham County Council]] established [[Neville's Cross]] College as a women's teacher training college. It became a licensed hall of the university in 1924.&lt;ref name=NCC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reed.dur.ac.uk/xtf/view?docId=ead/uni/undf.xml#UNDall-3922|title=Neville's Cross College|work=Durham University Records: Colleges|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 the university had 900 students in Newcastle but only 200 in Durham. The [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]] told the university in 1921 that it must produce ambitious expansion plans if it was to receive funding. This led to the establishment of a school of education and, in 1924, a faculty of pure science on what became known as the Science Site (now the Mountjoy site) on Elvet Hill. The Botanic Gardens were established on the Science Site in 1925.&lt;ref name=DUBG&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/botanic.garden/aboutus/history/|title=History of the Garden|accessdate=1 October 2015|publisher=Durham University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important appointments at this time included [[Arthur Holmes]], pioneer of [[geochronology]] and [[plate tectonics]], as Professor of Geology and [[climatologist]] [[Gordon Manley]], who established the Durham temperature series (based on meteorological observations at Durham Observatory and other sources) back to 1801 and the [[Central England temperature]] series dating back to 1659, as head of Geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Palatinate (newspaper)|Palatinate]]| title="Shaped by the past": our scientific legacy|date=22 October 2015|author=Shubhi Sharma}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/research/news/durham_pioneers/|title=Durham Pioneers|accessdate=7 November 2015|publisher=Durham University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Weather|publisher=[[Royal Meteorological Society]]|first1=J.

During the 1920s and 30s, [[Durham Castle]], home to University College, was found to be in danger of collapsing into the Wear. The issue was discussed in the House of Lords, with the government sympathising but saying there was nothing they could do to help – only [[ancient monuments]] were eligible for financial assistance, and these could not be occupied buildings. It was pointed out by Lord Gainford that this meant the government could help with the ruin once the Castle fell into the River, but could not act to prevent the castle being ruined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1928/jul/03/durham-castle|title=Durham Castle|publisher=Hansard|date=3 July 1928|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1927 the Great Hall was too dangerous to use, with degree convocations being moved to the Cathedral's Chapter House. The Durham Castle Preservation Fund raised around £100,000 in a nationwide campaign, with the government providing £10,000 in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1937/mar/04/special-areas#S5CV0321P0_19370304_HOC_44|title=Special Areas|publisher=Hansard|date=4 March 1928|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1934 underpinning had ensured the castle wouldn't collapse and convocations for degrees returned in December1936, but it wasn't until early 1939 that the castle was completely stabilisedd and could be fully returned to use.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=1162|title=Durham Castle underpinning|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000640/19361210/051/0002|title=Safe Now|work=Sunderland Echo and Shipping Gazette|date=10 December 1936|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's centenary should have been celebrated in 1932, but with the northeast still in the grip of the [[Great Depression]] the celebrations were postponed until the centenary of the Royal Charter in 1937.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt; 1932 did see the publication of a centenary history of the university, ''The University of Durham 1832 – 1932'' by Charles Whiting, professor of history at the university, who also edited a small volume for the 1937 celebrations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PuoQgAACAAJ|title=The University of Durham 1832 – 1932|publisher=Sheldon Press|author=Charles Whiting|date=1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sp3oMgEACAAJ|editor=Charles Whiting|date=1937|title=The University of Durham, 1937. (A General Account of the University.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional crisis===

In the 1930s, the federal University was plunged into a constitutional crisis by arguments between the two Newcastle colleges. Austerity was imposed on the College of Medicine by the Registrar and the Treasurer in 1931, who also demanded the resignation of the Principal without going through the Senate. This was compounded by their termination of an agreement with Armstrong College for medical students to receive teaching in physics, chemistry and biology there. The head of the UGC demanded action, and a [[Royal Commission]] was established by Act of Parliament in 1935 to look into the matter.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

The commission recommended changes to the university's constitution, of which the most visible was the merger of the two Newcastle colleges to form King's College (originally to be called University College, Newcastle until the Durham colleges objected). The two divisions also gained permanent heads: the Rector of King's College and the Warden of the Durham Colleges, with the vice-chancellorship alternated between them (the legacy of this lives on, in that the executive head of the university is still called "the vice-chancellor and warden"). Convocation's veto was abolished and a [[University Court]] established, and academic appointments were made the responsibility of the central University.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt; The Senate was made responsible for granting degrees, which had previously been a function of Convocation. As a result, the ceremony at which degrees are conferred at Durham was separated from the meeting of Convocation and become known as Congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001547/19430415/044/0002|date=15 April 1943|title=North Country Notes|work=Newcastle Journal|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new University Court set about fundraising for an expansion of the Durham division, with plans for new buildings for St Mary's College, the Student Union and the science laboratories. The importance of this expansion was emphasised by a fall in the number of students to the low 400s in 1939 due to cutbacks in teacher training, although Newcastle grew to 1500. In early 1939, permission was given to start work on the science site and the union, but this was cut short by the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

By the end of 1940, the number of students in Durham had fallen to only 270, forcing Hatfield and University colleges to temporarily merge. But 1941 saw RAF cadets sent to Durham to study science – primarily maths, physics and mechanics – raising student numbers back to healthier levels. Newcastle, with its much larger student population, was much less affected than the Durham Colleges.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

===Expansion after World War Two===

After the war, the Durham division expanded rapidly – the Warden, Sir [[James Fitzjames Duff|James Duff]], believing not only that growth was essential but that more accommodation was the necessary first step to growing the division. Durham had to be a residential university – it didn't have the local population to thrive otherwise. He planned to double the number of students in Durham to over 1000 in a decade. Under pressure from the UGC, this target was raised to 2000 in 1946. Newcastle was also constrained – at 1700 students it had reached what was felt to be the local capacity, and (like the other [[redbrick university|civic universities]]) would have to start looking further afield to attract students in order to reach its target of 3000.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

1947 saw progress towards this goal. St Aidan's Society ([[St Aidan's College, Durham|St Aidan's College]] from 1965) was founded as the female counterpart to St Cuthbert's Society, catering for the non-resident "home student" women, and moved onto Shincliffe Hall; the foundation stone for the new [[St Mary's College, Durham|St. Mary's]] College building on Elvet Hill was laid by Princess Elizabeth (later Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]); and plans for a new men's college (to become [[Grey College, Durham|Grey College]]) were approved by the Council of the Durham Colleges. In the same year, the College of the Venerable Bede (as St Bede's College had been renamed in 1935) became a constituent college of the university. [[Lumley Castle]] was also leased from 1945 to house students from University College. By 1948 the Durham division hit 1100 students – the growth in numbers outstripping the residential capacity of the university and leaving a third of students without College accommodation – while Newcastle had over 3200.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

{{Quote|We badly underestimated the rate at which our numbers would increase after the war|author=Sir James Duff|source=1950, quoted in ''The Durham Difference''&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;}}

St Mary's took five years to build, the new site finally opening in 1952. In the same year final approval was given to the establishment of a new men's college south of the river, linked with the expansion of the science site. However, although the UGC approved the plan, funds were not immediately available, however, and it was 1956 before financial approval was given and 1957 before building work began. The new college opened in 1959 as [[Grey College, Durham|Grey College]] – the name being chosen over Cromwell College by a single vote – but the main block was not completed until 1961.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GreyHistory&gt;{{cite book|title=From the Ashes|author=Nigel Watson|year=2004|publisher=James &amp; James (Publishers) Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expansion also continued in other parts of the university. The West Building, for the departments of geography and mathematics, opened in 1952. Work on a new central admissions system, replacing the system whereby students applied to individual colleges, began in 1958. In the same year St John's College was formally divided into two closely linked parts: St John's Hall for University students and [[Cranmer Hall, Durham|Cranmer Hall]] for those preparing for ordination.&lt;ref name="DF John's "&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Durham First|volume=26|title=The First Lady of Cranmer Hall|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/durham.first/spring09/cranmer/|date=2009|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1960 saw the opening of the department of applied science. In 1961, St Aidan's Society moved into its new building and became St Aidan's College. Work on Dunelm House and Kingsgate Bridge started in 1962.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

In 1960 the Council set a target of 3,000 students by the early 1970s, and in 1962 a target of 4,500 students by the early 1980s. Two more men's colleges (to become [[Van Mildert College]] and [[Collingwood College, Durham|Collingwood College]]) and a third women's college (to become [[Trevelyan College]]) were planned.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

In 1946 the University College of the West Indies was established, affiliated to the University of London.
In 1955 this became the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI) and Codrington College stopped offering degrees except in theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HRGW7WsDzhgC&amp;pg=PT85&amp;lpg=PT85&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Afro-Greeks: Dialogues between Anglophone Caribbean Literature and Classics in the Twentieth Century|author=Emily Greenwood|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=28 January 2010|pages=84–85 and 369–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, Coddington became affiliated to the UWI and no longer offered undergraduate Durham degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codrington.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=1 |title=A Historical Overview of Codrington College |accessdate=1 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119173303/http://www.codrington.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=1 |archivedate=19 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Codrington's affiliation to Durham was finally removed from the University Statutes on 13 July 2011.&lt;ref name=Statutes2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/orders-13july2011.pdf|publisher=[[Privy Council (UK)|Privy Council]]|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=1 November 2015|title=Orders approved at the Privy Council held by the Queen at Buckingham Palace on 13th July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tensions between the Newcastle and Durham divisions===

In 1947, tensions had surfaced again over the Durham-Newcastle divide, with the growth in numbers meaning "the two divisions were acting as de facto universities".&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt; Lord Percy, Rector of King's College, proposed that the university change its name to the 'University of Durham and Newcastle', with the divisions becoming  'Durham University' and 'Newcastle University'. This idea was defeated in [[Convocation]] (the assembly of members of the university) by 135 votes to 129.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Durham University Journal|page=121|volume=13–14|title=Name of the University|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Er4TAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22university+of+durham+and+newcastle%22&amp;dq=%22university+of+durham+and+newcastle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMIrqXugvCjyAIVy5qACh128AKN|publisher=Durham University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1950s, Durham had over 1,500 students and Newcastle 3,500. The academic board of the Newcastle division passed a resolution on 29 January 1960 calling for Newcastle to become an independent university:

{{Quote|the healthy development of the university now makes desirable the establishment of a University of Newcastle in place of King's College|author=Academic Board of the Newcastle Division of Durham University|source=quoted in ''The Durham Difference''&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;}}

On 23 February 1960 the academic board of the Durham division gave their agreement and by June the Council of King's College and the Council of the Durham Colleges had both approved. The government and the UGC approved the plan on 21 July, and by May 1961 statutes had been drafted. The Universities of Durham and Newcastle upon Tyne Act received Royal assent on 10 July 1963, and on 1 August 1963 King's College became the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], leaving Durham University once more based solely in its home city.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reed.dur.ac.uk/xtf/view?docId=ead/uni/unda.xml#UNDall-400|title=Statutes|work=Durham University Records: Foundation and Statutes|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/regulations/docs/statutes.pdf|title=University Statues – Newcastle University|accessdate=29 October 2015|publisher=[[Newcastle University]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705075412/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/regulations/docs/statutes.pdf#|archive-date=5 July 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1963/jul/10/royal-assent|date=10 July 1963|title=Royal Assent|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern university 1963–99==

The university's new statutes abolished the court but maintained the title of Warden of the Durham Colleges, with the executive head of the university being the vice-chancellor and warden. In 1963, the university consisted of five council colleges (now styled maintained colleges), with a further three planned, St Cuthbert's Society, the three independent constituent colleges (now styled recognised colleges), and the two licensed halls (the women's teacher training colleges: St Hild's and Neville's Cross).&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

Expansion continued, with Grey College's third building opening in 1963. In 1964 the centralised admissions system went into operation. [[Van Mildert College]], the School of Engineering, the [[Durham Business School]], the Graduate Society (now [[Ustinov College]]), the Maiden Castle sports ground and a number of other academic departments all opened in 1965; and in the same year the BEd degree was introduced for students at the teacher training colleges. [[Trevelyan College]] and the new buildings for St Aidan's College opened in 1966.  The [[Durham University Botanic Garden|botanic garden]] moved to its current site in 1970.&lt;ref name=DUBG /&gt; Construction of new residences for University College in Durham also meant Lumley Castle could finally be given up in 1970.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

[[Sierra Leone]] had gained its independence in 1961, and in 1967 the government established the [[University of Sierra Leone]]. Fourah Bay College joined Njala University College to form the new University and ended its affiliation with Durham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/gah/fourah-bay-college-1827|title=
Fourah Bay College|work=Online Encyclopedia of Significant People and Places in Global African History|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Neville's Cross College became mixed,&lt;ref name=NCC /&gt; and in 1966 Cranmer Hall in St John's College became the first Anglican theological college in the world to train women for ordination.&lt;ref name="DF John's " /&gt; The [[Roman Catholic]] [[seminary]] of [[Ushaw College]], which had been located in [[Ushaw Moor]] near Durham since 1808, was licensed as a hall of residence in 1968. St Chad's Hall stopped training for the Anglican priesthood in 1972, and in 1976 changed its name to St Chad's College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reed.dur.ac.uk/xtf/view?docId=ead/uni/undf.xml#UNDall-3476|title=St Chad's College|work=Durham University Records: Colleges|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the sports hall at Maiden Castle opened and in 1966 Dunelm House was finally completed, providing centralised student facilities and a home for the Student Representative Council and the Athletics Union moved in. In 1969 the Statutes were amended to give the president of the Student Representative Council a seat on the University Council.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/university.calendar/volumei/2003.2004/statutes/stat8.pdf|title=The Council|work=Statutes of the University of Durham|date=2003|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 the Student Representative Council became Durham Student Union.&lt;ref name=DSU /&gt;

In the 1970s the reorganisation of teacher training by the government threatened the existence of the three teacher training colleges. In 1975 St Hild's College and the College of the Venerable Bede merged to form the [[College of St Hild and St Bede]], remaining a Recognised College and teaching a university-validated BEd. This lasted until 1979 when it surrendered its autonomy to become a Maintained College of the university, with all teacher training being transferred to the university's School of Education.&lt;ref name=HildBede /&gt; Neville's Cross College merged with Durham Technical College in 1977, leaving the university and forming [[New College Durham]].&lt;ref name=NCC /&gt;

Following the lowering of the [[age of majority]] from 21 to 18 in 1970, meaning universities were no longer ''in loco parentis'', Van Mildert became the first maintained college to go mixed in 1971, with some students transferring in from other colleges that year followed by a full intake in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/van-mildert.college/about/history/crest/|title= Building the College|publisher=Van Mildert College|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1972 by the opening of [[Collingwood College, Durham|Collingwood College]] as the first purpose-built mixed college, and the first university residence in the UK to have men's and women's rooms in the same blocks.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt; In 1973 St John's College went fully mixed, admitting women to St John's Hall.&lt;ref name="DF John's " /&gt;

St Aidan's decided to become mixed in 1978, with the first men entering in 1981 – the first of the Women's colleges to do so. This was followed by Grey JCR voting to go mixed in 1983, and the College governing board ratifying the decision.

In 1986 Durham Castle and Cathedral were made a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in the first group of sites recognised in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/heritage|publisher=Durham World Heritage Site|title=What is Durham World Heritage Site?|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was extended in 2008 to cover Palace Green and the surrounding buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/heritage/site-boundaries|publisher=Durham World Heritage Site|title=Site Boundaries: An Evolving Definition of Heritage|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 the perception still existed that the university was too small. The student population was limited to 5000 (4936 in 1987), and had only grown by 200 over the previous 5 years. The Senate noted in May 1988 that expansion was desirable, but that it would be more cost effective, and less risky to do this by making "more intensive use … of the present facilities" rather than establishing a new College.&lt;ref name=Stockton&gt;{{cite book|url=http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/MainSite%20pages/Resources/OxCHEPS_OP3.pdf|title=Breaking the Mould: The Surprising Story of Stockton|author=John Hayward|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reed.dur.ac.uk/xtf/view?docId=ead/uni/undf.xml#UNDall-6556|title=Howlands Trust Project|work=Durham University Records: Colleges|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990 numbers had reached 5,908 and by 1995, 9,717 in Durham City or 10,436 including Stockton (see below) – doubling the population in under ten years.&lt;ref name="Durham Masterplan"/&gt;

In 1988 the [[Wesley Study Centre]] opened within St John's College as a training centre for Methodist ministers, forming a unique ecumenical partnership with Cranmer Hall to train Anglican and Methodist ministers alongside each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/wsc.online/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Wesley-Study-Centre-Prospectus3.pdf|title=Wesley Study Centre Prospectus|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the university started its fund-raising and [[alumni]] office, with a virtual community for alumni&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dunelm.org.uk dunelm.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; and several large gifts made to the university, including for the Centre for Middle Eastern Studies, the [[Durham University Department of Physics|Department of Physics]] and the [[Wolfson Research Institute]].

1990 saw the opening of the [[Teikyo University of Japan in Durham]], an overseas campus of [[Teikyo University]] in [[Japan]], by [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.teikyo-u.ac.jp/english/pdf/english_guide.pdf|publisher=Teikyo University|page=4|title=Global Guide Book|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/hr/applicants/about/highlights/|title=Historical Highlights|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993 to 1997 the university attempted unsuccessfully to raise funds for a new college at Howlands Farm. In 1997 the decision was made to instead build postgraduate accommodation on the site under the management of the existing Graduate Society.&lt;ref name=Stockton /&gt;

In 1994, Durham was one of the founder members of the [[1994 Group]] of smaller research-intensive universities, set up in response to the establishment of the [[Russell Group]].

===Development in Stockton===

The idea of Durham University establishing a presence on Teesside was first floated in 1987 and planning began in earnest in 1988 for a "Birkbeck of the North" with around 1,000 students. Teesside was, at that time, the largest conurbation in Europe without a university, and the [[Teesside Development Corporation]] had recently been established to try to regenerate the area. In April 1989 a formal announcement was made that Teesside Polytechnic and Durham University were working together "in planning a major development in Higher Education in Cleveland and its adjacent areas".
&lt;ref name=Stockton /&gt;

Stresses in the partnership arise in December 1989, when Durham approved plans for a new Institute of Health Studies without discussions with the Polytechnic. This led in January 1990 to a formula establishing the development as a Joint University College between Durham and Teesside rather than (as originally conceived) a Durham college with backing from Teesside. This was approved by Senate in mid February and the initiative was launched publicly three days later.&lt;ref name=Stockton /&gt;

The initial bid to the funding councils (the Universities Funding Council – UFC; and the Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council – PCFC) was for 280 students initially, rising to 840 after three years. In 1991 the UFC and PCFC agreed to fund 100 places each initially, rising to 225 each – only half of what had been hoped for. Nevertheless, plans went ahead and a site opposite [[Stockton-on-Tees]] on the south bank of the river was chosen. The Joint University College on Teesside (JUCOT) was formally launched on 3 September 1991 by [[Michael Fallon]], Schools Minister and MP for Darlington.&lt;ref name=Stockton /&gt;

On 1 January 1992, Robert Parfitt was appointed as the first Principal of the College. Later that year Durham's statutes were modified to allow it grant joint degrees, regulations for the degrees to be awarded by JUCOT were established, and JUCOT was formally incorporated as a Limited Company established under a joint venture agreement between Durham and Teesside. The name did not, however, prove acceptable to the various government departments, nor was the alternative of Queen's College (there were too many already), but the name of University College, Stockton was approved just before opening on 12 October 1992 with an initial enrolment of 190 students.&lt;ref name=Stockton /&gt;

Near the end of is first year of operation, the College was formally opened by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 18 May 1993. The 1993 academic year saw student numbers grow to 430 with the addition of teacher training. In 1994, at the suggestion of the UCS board, Durham assumed administrative and financial responsibility for the College. At the same time, approval was given to build student residences at Stockton, and the Privy Council approved changes to Durham's statutes making UCS a residential and teaching college of the university.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stockton /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041016085906/http://www.dur.ac.uk/about/history/qcs.php|archive-date=16 October 2004|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/about/history/qcs.php|title=Foundation of Queen's Campus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parfitt retired in April 1994 and was replaced as Principal by John Hayward. Integration with Durham began, with the departments being established as Boards of Studies, and the company being wound up – its Board of Directors becoming (like Durham colleges) a Board of Governors, still including Teesside but with increased representation from Durham.&lt;ref name=Stockton /&gt;

In 1996 it was agreed that students at Stockton would take degrees of Durham from 1998, rather than the joint degrees that had been awarded previously. With Durham taking on sole responsibility in 1998, the campus was renamed the University of Durham, Stockton Campus (UDSC), separating teaching responsibilities from UCS.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stockton /&gt;
&lt;!--
A curious fact about Queen's Campus, Stockton, is that it is located on the south bank of the [[River Tees]] within [[Thornaby-on-Tees]] and not in Stockton at all. For centuries the Tees formed the historical division between the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]] of [[Yorkshire]] and Durham, with Thornaby-on-Tees being one of the most northern towns in Yorkshire. With the creation of the county borough of [[Teesside]] in 1968 areas both north and south of the river were removed from their administrative counties. Teesside itself was engulfed into the County of [[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]] in 1974. Yet another local government change in 1996 saw the breakup of the county of Cleveland into the current four unitary authorities of [[Middlesbrough (borough)|Middlesbrough]], [[Hartlepool (borough)|Hartlepool]], [[Redcar and Cleveland]] &amp; [[Stockton-on-Tees (borough)|Stockton-on-Tees]]. With this latest reorganisation Thornaby-On-Tees became part of the borough of Stockton-on-Tees, however the town of Stockton-on-Tees itself is located on the north ("County Durham") side of the river, and is one of the most southerly towns Durham. The upshot of all this is that a significant proportion of Durham University is actually located within the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[North Yorkshire]], rather than County Durham. Adding to the confusion, plans exist to expand the campus on to the north bank of the River Tees, splitting the campus between the two ceremonial counties.--&gt;

==21st century==
In 2000 the new Graduate Society accommodation and offices at the Howlands Farm site were opened. The Graduate Society became [[Ustinov College]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

By 2000 student numbers at University College, Stockton had reached 1,350, with plans to grow to 2,000 by 2003. It was bigger than any other Durham college, and set to keep growing. It was therefore decided to split UCS into two colleges that would be similar to the colleges in Durham City. The colleges were established as "shadow colleges" in October 2000. The two new colleges, named [[John Snow College|John Snow]] and [[Stephenson College, Durham|Stephenson]] (originally George Stephenson) after the [[John Snow (physician)|physician]] and the [[George Stephenson|engineer]], were formally established in September 2001, replacing UCS.&lt;ref name=Stockton /&gt;

Also in 2001 the new [[medical school]] at UDSC (operating in association with the [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne]]) took in its first students – the first medics to join Durham since 1963 – and the [[Wolfson Research Institute]] opened.&lt;ref name=Stockton /&gt; In 2002, her [[golden jubilee]] year, the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] granted UDSC the title of "Queen's Campus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=3163|title=A Queen’s Award for university campus in Stockton-on-Tees|date=8 May 2002|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2002 saw the location for degree congregations moved from Durham Castle and Stockton Parish Church to Durham Cathedral, reducing the number of ceremonies from 24 (3 in Stockton) to a more manageable 12.&lt;ref name=Stockton /&gt; By 2003, 10 years after Stockton's opening, the university had 11,021 undergraduates, 17% of them on the Queen's Campus, and 2843 postgraduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/about/facts/student/ |title=The University : Student Statistics - Durham University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051207012000/http://www.dur.ac.uk/about/facts/student/|archive-date=7 December 2005|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013 this had increased to 12550 undergraduates, still with 17% in Stockton, and 4538 postgraduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/student.registry/statistics/summary/1.1summary/131-1.pdf|title=Summary of Student Numbers 2013/2014|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the last single-sex college, [[St Mary's College, Durham|St. Mary's]], which was receiving fewer than 200 direct applications each year, voted to go mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Castellum|title=Letter from the Master December 2003|volume=56|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first undergraduate men entered in 2005. In 2004 the university started the building of a new college next to Ustinov on the Howlands Farm site, as well as the construction of more accommodation for Ustinov. This opened in 2006 as [[Josephine Butler College]], the first completely new college to open in Durham itself since the 1970s, and the only purpose-built self-catering college within Durham.&lt;ref name=Watson2007 /&gt;

2003 also saw the announcement of a controversial Strategic Improvement Plan. This included the closure of the departments of East Asian Studies and European Studies, the transfer if Linguistics to Newcastle (receiving their department of Religious Studies in return) and the movement of Middle East and Islamic Studies to become postgraduate-only, losing is undergraduate intake. The closures were expected to free up £8.7M for re-investment in more popular courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|title=The axe falls|date=22 July 2003|author=John Crace|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/jul/22/highereducation.cutsandclosures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/dec/02/highereducation.administration|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|title=Durham and Newcastle to trade departments|date=2 December 2003|author=Donald MacLeod}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1436196/Durham-approves-studies-closure.html|title=Durham approves studies closure|author=Liz Lightfoot|date=16 July 2003|newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closure, particularly of East Asian Studies, meet with opposition from the [[Foreign Office]], [[Durham City Council]] and the [[Japan Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]]|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1434933/Foreign-Office-joins-those-casting-doubt-on-Durham-closures.html|title=Foreign Office joins those casting doubt on Durham closures|author1=Richard Alleyne|author2=Liz Lightfoot|date=5 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wear/3275219.stm|title=Row over university cuts|date=16 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cuts formed part of a tend in UK higher education at the time for small departments to be closed or merged, linked by [[The Guardian]] to "a combination of market forces and a strict funding regime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|title=The chemistry of closure|author=John Crace|date=23 March 2004|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/mar/23/highereducation.cutsandclosures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=University confirms subject cuts|date=20 December 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4105961.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Durham was shortlisted for the [[Sunday Times University of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Another accolade recognises quality of teaching and learning at Durham|date=10 September 2004|accessdate=7 November 2015|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=3708}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 it was shortlisted again and won the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=971|title=Durham is named ‘University of the Year’|date=30 September 2005|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the university unveiled a new [[logo]] (consisting of a stylised monochrome version of the coat of arms in [[Palatinate (colour)|palatinate purple]]) and [[logotype]], and adopted the trading name of "Durham University". The new branding caused much discussion, and Van Mildert JCR voted not to use the new name and logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Van Mildert College JCR Minutes|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/vm.jcr/dl.php?file=minutes-2005-05-08.pdf|date=8 May 2005|accessdate= 5 March 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629102002/http://www.dur.ac.uk/vm.jcr/dl.php?file=minutes-2005-05-08.pdf|archive-date=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Castellum|url=https://www.castlealumni.uk/files/castellum/Castellum%252058%2520(2005).pdf|title=Letter from the Master October 2005|date=2005|volume=58|page=4}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official name of the institution remains the University of Durham and no change was made to the actual coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/about/trading_name/|title=Trading name|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Charities Act 2006]] necessitated a number of changes to the structure of the university's student bodies that went into effect in 2011. Previously [[exempt charity|exempt charities]], Student Unions were now to be regulated by the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]. The College JCRs were forced to decide whether to remain independent and become registered charities or to become part of the university. The university set up the "Durham Student Organisations Framework" for those JCRs (from the Maintained Colleges) becoming part of the university. Most eligible JCRs, along with Team Durham (previously the Durham University Athletics Union) and some other University-wide student bodies, chose to join this framework. [[Durham Students Union]], the JCRs of Grey, St Cuthbert's and Trevelyan, and the Ustinov GCR, became independent charities on 1 August 2011. Trevelyan JCR has since joined the framework (on 1 January 2014) and ceased to be an independent charity. St John's JCR also chose to become an independent charity rather than be merged with the College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/ges/student_organisations/g_jcrs/historical/|title=Historical Status|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/ges/student_organisations/g_jcrs/|title=Current Status of the Student Organisations|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/ges/student_organisations/|title=Governance of Student Organisations|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/ges/student_organisations/team_durham/|title=Team Durham|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Palatinate (newspaper)|Palatinate]]|title=Decision time for JCRs|date=7 March 2011|author=Sarah Ingrams|url=http://www.palatinate.org.uk/?p=12465|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1155621&amp;subid=0|title=John's Common Room|publisher=Charity Commission|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also removed exempt charity status from the colleges and halls in the universities of Cambridge and Durham and the colleges in the University of Oxford. This forced the St John's College, St Chad's College, and Ushaw College to become registered charities (the Maintained Colleges, being legally incorporated into the university and thus not having separate charitable status, were not affected).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stchads.ac.uk/college/documents/college-status/|title=Charitable and legal status|publisher=St Chad's College|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/about/governance/charitable_status/charities/|title=Charities linked to the University of Durham|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2010/em/uksiem_20100500_en.pdf|title=Explanatory Memorandum to the Charities Act 2006 (Changes in Exempt Charities) Order 2010|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=527408&amp;subid=0|title=St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw|publisher=Charity Commission|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the campus cafeteria, "The Waterside Room", was renovated and now serves as the campus student bar. In addition to this facility both colleges at the campus benefit from their own college bars, managed centrally, however, and not by their JCRs. 
In 2007 the university announced that it had acquired an option on {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}}  of land in the 56-acre Northshore development on the north bank of the Tees, opposite the existing Queen's Campus site, along with plans to develop the academic structure at Queen's and the possibility of a new college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=5537|title= Durham University to extend Stockton campus|date=11 July 2007|publisher=Durham University|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was announced that after a four-year delay due to the state of the economy, the Northshore development was proceeding, including plans from the university for academic facilities and a 500-bed residential development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/new-plans-flagship-northshore-development-3670361|title= New plans for flagship Northshore development site|newspaper=The Gazette|date=10 September 2012|author=Mike Blackburn|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen's Campus cafeteria, was reopened after renovation in February 2008 to serve as a dining room, the Waterside Restaurant, used two days a week by each of the two Queen's Campus colleges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/catering.queens/collegesevening/|title=Colleges' Evening Dining|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their joint college bar, the Waterside Bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/stephenson/facilities/bar/|title=Bar|publisher=Stephenson College|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 2009 the [[Infinity Bridge]] was opened, linking the Queen's Campus and the Teasdale business park to the Northshore development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediscoverstockton.co.uk/riverside/stocktons-bridges/|title=Stockton's Bridges|accessdate=2 November 2015|publisher=Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015 it was announced that the university would not be renewing its option on development of the Northshore site and would be holding a "wide and robust consultation process" on the future of the Queen's Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Palatinate (newspaper)|Palatinate]]|title=Future of Queen’s Campus to undergo consultation|date=4 November 2015|author=Ryan Gould|url=http://www.palatinate.org.uk/?p=63721|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Durham City, development was concentrated in the Elvet Hill area, leading to fears that Durham was moving away from the city centre and becoming a "campus university".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Palatinate (newspaper)|Palatinate]]|title=Fears of "Campus University" grow|date=27 October 2011|author=Rowena Caine|url=http://www.palatinate.org.uk/?p=16146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Calman Learning Centre on the Mountjoy Site opened in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/cis/theatres/calman/|title=Calman Learning Centre|accessdate=3 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119195304/https://www.dur.ac.uk/cis/theatres/calman/|archivedate=19 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by Anthropology moving to Mountjoy and Economics moving to the Business School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Palatinate (newspaper)|Palatinate]]|title=Higgins insists the University is not moving|date=15 November 2011|author=Rowena Caine|url=http://www.palatinate.org.uk/?p=17046}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the new Palatine Centre was opened on the Mountjoy Site, housing the Law school and the university administration and an extension to the Bill Bryson library on the Mountjoy Site was opened.&lt;ref name=Palatine&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=15646|title=Durham invests in enhanced student experience with new Palatine Centre|date=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/library/developments/mainlibrary/|title=Bill Bryson Library Developments|accessdate=3 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119195208/https://www.dur.ac.uk/library/developments/mainlibrary/|archivedate=19 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the university also spent £10 million on the refurbishment of the Palace Green Library between 2009 and 2014,&lt;ref name=Palatine /&gt; creating new galleries and a special exhibitions space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/library/developments/palacegreen/|title=Palace Green Library Redevelopments|accessdate=3 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119204153/https://www.dur.ac.uk/library/developments/palacegreen/|archivedate=19 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, [[Tony Blair]], the former [[British Prime Minister]], announced a strategic partnership with Durham University, following [[Yale University]] and the [[National University of Singapore]], to create a [[Faith and Globalisation Network of Universities|global network]] of twelve leading research universities for delivering his Faith and Globalization Initiative in association with [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tony Blair foundation partnership with Durham University |url=http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/2009/07/parnership-with-durham-univers.html |publisher=tonyblairfaithfoundation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724165135/http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/2009/07/parnership-with-durham-univers.html |archivedate=24 July 2009 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2010 and 2012, Durham was criticised for accepting a number of donations from controversial sources. On 28 January 2010, Durham hosted a seminar sponsored by the government of [[Iran]], which attracted protests and coverage in the national press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/feb/10/iranian-funding-durham-university-boycott|title=Iranian tensions shake Durham's ivory towers|author=Ian Black|date=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, the Durham Student newspaper [[Palatinate (newspaper)|Palatinate]] broke the story that a [[WikiLeaks]] cable revealed that a series of Iranian seminars at Durham had been funded by the [[US State Department]] as "political cover" for contacts with Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Palatinate (newspaper)|Palatinate]]|date=8 February 2011|url=http://www.palatinate.org.uk/?p=10679|title=Durham University engulfed in Wikileaks allegations|author1=Daniel Johnson|author2=Jack Battersby}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[BBC]]|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-12908507|title=Durham University defends accepting funds from Iran|author=Simon Cox|date=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/10/wikileaks-durham-university-iran-us-embassy|title=WikiLeaks reveals degree of Durham University's involvement in Iran|author=Ian Black|date=10 February 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice-Chancellor [[Chris Higgins (academic)|Chris Higgins]] claimed in an interview with Palatinate that the funding had not been deliberately hidden and would have been revealed if anyone had asked, but accepted that more should have been done to let participants know the source of the funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palatinate.org.uk/?p=12008|newspaper=[[Palatinate (newspaper)|Palatinate]]|title=Vice-chancellor defends Durham’s ethical funding policy|date=3 March 2011|author1=Jack Battersby|author2=Daniel Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Robert Halfon]] accused Durham of accepting "blood money" from the Iranian government and launched an [[Early Day Motion]] (which attracted no other signatories) calling for a Government enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Palatinate (newspaper)|Palatinate]]|url=http://www.palatinate.org.uk/?p=12659|title=MP accuses Durham of accepting "blood money"|date=12 March 2011|author=Sarah Ingrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2010-12/1563|title=Links Between Iran And Durham University|publisher=[[British Parliament]]|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month it was revealed that the university had accepted a £2.5M donation from the Prime Minister of [[Kuwait]], Sheikh [[Nasser Al-Sabah]], to endow the [[Sheikh Nasser Bin Muhammad Al-Sabah Professor in International Relations|Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad Al-Sabah Chair]] and a related research programme in global security,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/alsabah/sabahchair/|title=The Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad al-Sabah Chair|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Palatinate (newspaper)|Palatinate]]|url=http://www.palatinate.org.uk/?p=12796|title=Kuwait PM to donate £2.5m to Durham|date=30 March 2011|author=Daniel Johnson|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120914094130/http://www.palatinate.org.uk/?p=12796|archivedate=14 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to further criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2011/04/shaky-dealings-are-damaging-the-reputation-of-britains-universities/|title=Shaky dealings are damaging the reputation of Britain’s universities|newspaper=[[The Spectator]]|author=David Blackburn|date=1 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119171502/http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2011/04/shaky-dealings-are-damaging-the-reputation-of-britains-universities/|archivedate=19 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was overshadowed a few weeks later by the news that Durham had accepted £125,000 from [[British American Tobacco]] towards an appeal for scholarships for Afghan women from [[Kabul University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/durham-university-criticised-accepting-tobacco-4432126|newspaper=The Journal|title=Durham University criticised for accepting tobacco cash|date=17 May 2011|author=Ruth Lawson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university claimed that "The BAT donation was accepted following careful consideration by the University Executive Committee (UEC) in line with its Gift Acceptance Policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-13422170|newspaper=[[BBC]]|title=Durham University defends British American Tobacco cash|date=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Cancer Research UK]] claimed that "The death and disease caused by BAT's products dwarf this small award" and accused Durham of breaching the  [[World Health Organization]]'s [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jun/07/durham-university-tobacco-funding-afghan-award|title=Furore over Durham's tobacco funding for Afghan scholarship|author=Lucy Tobin|date=7 June 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, it was reported by [[WikiLeaks]] that an aide to Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]] was to receive a PhD from Durham. Halfon again attacked the university, which responded with a statement saying that students were admitted and awarded degrees solely on merit and denying "any formal or active links with the Syrian government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Durham Times]]|url=http://www.durhamtimes.co.uk/news/9805439.University_denies_Syrian_links/?ref=rss|title=University denies Syrian links|date=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September the al-Sabah programme was officially launched in the presence of Sheikh Nasser al-Sabah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Dialogue|publisher=Durham University |url=http://issuu.com/communicationsoffice/docs/dialogue_issue_26/7|page=7|volume=26|title=Nassar Al-Mohammad Al-Sabah Middle East Security Research Programme|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since pledging his donation the Sheikh had been forced to resign as Prime Minister of Kuwait in late 2011 over allegations his government had misappropriated state funds. Despite his being cleared of the allegations by a judicial tribunal in May 2012, this drew further protests from Halfon and links were drawn by the [[Daily Telegraph]] between this and the acceptance by the [[London School of Economics]] of donations from [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi|Saif al-Islam]], son of [[Libya]]n leader Colonel [[Ghadaffi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Durham University's £2.5m Kuwaiti gift 'astonishing', says Conservative MP|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/9574061/Durham-Universitys-2.5m-Kuwaiti-gift-astonishing-says-Conservative-MP.html|date=1 October 2012|author=Andrew Marszal|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012 it was revealed by the [[Times Higher Education]] that the university's senior management had overruled the Ethics Committee to accept the donation from British American Tobacco. It was also revealed that the university and British American Tobacco had agreed not to publicise the donation for fear of attracting criticism and that the executive committee had been split over accepting the money. The Times Higher Education revealed there had been resignations from the university's council over the issue and asked if the resignation of the university's registrar in June 2012 was also linked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Times Higher Education]]|title=Tobacco gift to Durham caused turmoil at the top|author=David Matthews|date=8 November 2012|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/tobacco-gift-to-durham-caused-turmoil-at-the-top/421718.article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Durham, along with three other universities, accepted an invitation to join the [[Russell Group]] and left the [[1994 Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/12/russell-group-four-more-universities|date=12 March 2012|title=Russell Group extends membership to four more universities|author=Jessica Shepherd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Council endorsed a "residential accommodation strategy" for 2012–2020. This sets a target of 50–70% of students housed in University accommodation and predicted growth in student numbers to 14,000 in Durham City and 2,500 at the Queen's Campus by 2015/16 and to 15,300 in Durham City and 3,400 at the Queen's Campus by 2019/20. With 5,700 beds in Durham and 900 in Stockton for 2012/13, meeting the accommodation targets would require (in Durham) 1,250 new beds by 2015 and 1,950 by 2019 and (in Stockton) 730 new beds by 2015 and 1,150 by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/estates/documents/DurhamUniversity-ResidentialAccommodationStrategy2012-2020.ppt|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20160109090034/https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/estates/documents/DurhamUniversity-ResidentialAccommodationStrategy2012-2020.ppt|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 January 2016|title=Residential Accommodation Strategy 2012–2020|publisher=Durham University|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2012, the [[Church of England]] announced that Durham had been chosen as the partner university for the [[Common Award]] for ministerial training. This scheme provides for a common suite of awards, validated by Durham, for all ordinands in the Church of England and its partner churches from September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Church Times]]|title=Durham University to validate C of E ordination training|author=Madeleine Davies|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/clergy-office-holders/ministry/ministerial-education-and-development/common-awards-in-theology,-ministry-and-mission/about-the-common-awards.aspx|title=About the Common Awards|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[Michael Ramsey]] Chair in Anglican Studies (not to be confused with [[University of Kent|Kent]]'s Michael Ramsey Chair in Modern Theology) was established in partnership with Durham Cathedral.

{{Economics sidebar}}
'''Human capital''' is the stock of [[knowledge]], [[habit]]s, [[social]] and [[personality]] attributes, including [[creativity]], embodied in the ability to perform [[Labour (economics)|labor]] so as to produce [[economic value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/human_capital_handbook_of_cliometrics_0.pdf|title=Human Capital|last=Claudia Goldin|first=Department of Economics Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human capital theory is closely associated with the study of [[human resources]] management as found in the practice of business administration and macroeconomics. The original idea of human capital can be traced back at least to [[Adam Smith]] in the [[18th century]]. The modern theory was popularized by [[Gary Becker]], an economist and Nobel Laureate from the [[University of Chicago]], [[Jacob Mincer]], and [[Theodore Schultz]]. As a result of his conceptualization and modeling work using Human Capital as a key factor, the Nobel Prize for Economics, 2018, was awarded (jointly) to Paul Romer who founded the modern innovation-driven approach to understanding economic growth.

In the recent literature, the new concept of '''task-specific human capital''' was coined in 2004 by [[Robert Gibbons (economist)|Robert Gibbon]], an economist at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and [https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/Faculty-And-Research/Profile?id=mw46 Michael Waldman], an economist at [https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/About Cornell]. The concept emphasizes that in many cases, human capital is accumulated specific to the nature of the task (or, skills required for the task), and the human capital accumulated for the task are valuable to many firms requiring the transferable skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibbons|first=Robert|last2=Waldman|first2=Michael|date=May 2004|title=Task-Specific Human Capital|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/0002828041301579|journal=American Economic Review|volume=94|issue=2|pages=203–207|doi=10.1257/0002828041301579|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept can be applied to job-assignment, wage dynamics, tournament, promotion dynamics inside firms, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibbons|first=Robert|last2=Waldman|first2=Michael|date=2006-01-01|title=Enriching a Theory of Wage and Promotion Dynamics inside Firms|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/497819|journal=Journal of Labor Economics|volume=24|issue=1|pages=59–107|doi=10.1086/497819|issn=0734-306X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Arthur Lewis (economist)|Arthur Lewis]] is said to have begun the field of  [[development economics]] and consequently the idea of human capital when he wrote in 1954   "Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour."&lt;ref&gt;W. Arthur Lewis (1954) [ftp://ftp.uic.edu/pub/depts/econ/wpaper/cchis/docs533/Economic%20Development%20with%20Unlimited%20Supplies%20of%20Labour%20-%20Arthur%20Lewis.pdf    "Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour."]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "human capital" was not used due to its negative undertones until it was first discussed by [[Arthur Cecil Pigou]]:

{{block quote|There is such a thing as investment in human capital as well as investment in material capital. So soon as this is recognised, the distinction between economy in consumption and economy in investment becomes blurred. For, up to a point, consumption is investment in personal productive capacity. This is especially important in connection with children: to reduce unduly expenditure on their consumption may greatly lower their efficiency in after-life. Even for adults, after we have descended a certain distance along the scale of wealth, so that we are beyond the region of luxuries and "unnecessary" comforts, a check to personal consumption is also a check to investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Arthur Cecil Pigou |last=Pigou |first=Arthur Cecil |title=A Study in Public Finance |year=1928 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |page=29 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The use of the term in the modern [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] [[economics|economic]] literature dates back to [[Jacob Mincer]]'s article "Investment in Human Capital and Personal Income Distribution" in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Mincer, Jacob   ''Studies in Human Capital''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Exx8_r-RpQkC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22Investment+in+Human+Capital+and+Personal+Income+Distribution%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dAcTl0R7gX&amp;sig=kKCcB2craNSOmlMhjfL8qvvrURc&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Investment%20in%20Human%20Capital%20and%20Personal%20Income%20Distribution%22&amp;f=false 1.  "Investment in Human Capital and Personal Income Distribution"]. Edward Elgar Publishing, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Then [[Theodore Schultz]] also contributed to the development of the subject matter. The best-known application of the idea of "human capital" in economics is that of Mincer and [[Gary Becker]] of the [[Chicago school (economics)|"Chicago School" of economics]]. Becker's book entitled ''Human Capital'', published in 1964, became a standard reference for many years. In this view, human capital is similar to "[[Capital (economics)|physical means of production]]", e.g., factories and machines: one can invest in human capital (via education, training, medical treatment) and one's outputs depend partly on the [[Rate of return on investment|rate of return]] on the human capital one owns. Thus, human capital is a [[means of production]], into which additional investment yields additional output. Human capital is substitutable, but not transferable like land, labor, or fixed capital.

Some  contemporary [[Economic growth#Theories and models|growth theories]] see human capital as an important [[economic growth]] factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Hanushek |first2=Ludger |last2=Woessmann |title=The Role of Cognitive Skills in Economic Development |year=2008 |journal=[[Journal of Economic Literature]] |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=607–668 |doi=10.1257/jel.46.3.607| url=http://hanushek.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Hanushek%2BWoessmann%202008%20JEL%2046%283%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research shows the relevance of education for the economic welfare of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rindermann |first=Heiner |title=Relevance of education and intelligence at the national level for the economic welfare of people |date=March 2008 |journal=Intelligence |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=127–142 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2007.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Smith]] defined four types of fixed capital (which is characterized as that which affords a revenue or profit without circulating or changing masters). The four types were:
# useful machines, instruments of the trade;
# buildings as the means of procuring revenue;
# improvements of land;
# the acquired and useful abilities of all the inhabitants or members of the society.
Smith defined human capital as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fourthly, of the acquired and useful abilities of all the inhabitants or members of the society.  The acquisition of such talents, by the maintenance of the acquirer during his education, study, or apprenticeship, always costs a real expense, which is a capital fixed and realized, as it were, in his person.  Those talents, as they make a part of his fortune, so do they likewise that of the society to which he belongs.  The improved dexterity of a workman may be considered in the same light as a machine or instrument of trade which facilitates and abridges labor, and which, though it costs a certain expense, repays that expense with a profit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamsmith.org/smith/won-b2-c1.htm] Smith, Adam: ''An Inquiry into the Nature And Causes of the Wealth of Nations Book 2 – Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock''; Published 1776.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Therefore, Smith argued, the productive power of labor are both dependent on the division of labor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgement with which it is any where directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is a complex relationship between the division of labor and human capital.

==Background==
''Human capital'' is a collection of traits – all the knowledge, talents, skills, abilities, experience, intelligence, training, judgment, and wisdom possessed individually and collectively by individuals in a population. These resources are the total capacity of the people that represents a form of wealth which can be directed to accomplish the goals of the nation or state or a portion thereof. The human capital is further distributed into three kinds; 
(1) Intellectual Capital 
(2) Social Capital
(3) Emotional Capital 

It is an aggregate economic view of the human being acting within economies, which is an attempt to capture the social, biological, cultural and psychological complexity as they interact in explicit and/or economic transactions.  Many theories explicitly connect investment in human capital development to education, and the role of human capital in economic development, productivity growth, and innovation has frequently been cited as a justification for government subsidies for education and job skills training.&lt;ref name=Simkovic&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Simkovic |ssrn=1941070 |title=Risk-Based Student Loans |year=2013 |journal=[[Washington and Lee Law Review]] |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=527 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Human capital" has been and continues to be criticized in numerous ways. [[Michael Spence]] offers signaling theory as an alternative to human capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Spence |year=1973 |title=Job Market Signaling |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=355–374 |doi=10.2307/1882010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Spence |year=2002 |title=Signaling in Retrospect and the Informational Structure of Markets |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=434–459 |doi=10.1257/00028280260136200 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2001/spence-lecture.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Bourdieu]] offers a nuanced conceptual alternative to human capital that includes [[cultural capital]], [[social capital]], [[economic capital]], and [[symbolic capital]].&lt;ref&gt;The Forms of Capital: English version published 1986 in J.G. Richardson's Handbook for Theory and Research for the Sociology of Education, pp. 241–258.&lt;/ref&gt; These critiques, and [[Human capital#Criticism|other debates]], suggest that "human capital" is a reified concept without sufficient explanatory power.

It was assumed in early economic theories, reflecting the context – i.e., the [[secondary sector of the economy]] was producing much more than the [[tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]] was able to produce at the time in most countries&amp;nbsp;– to be a [[Fungibility|fungible]] [[Resource (economics)|resource]], homogeneous, and easily interchangeable, and it was referred to simply as workforce or [[employment|labor]], one of three [[factors of production]] (the others being land, and assumed-interchangeable assets of money and physical equipment).  Just as land became recognized as [[natural capital]] and an asset in itself, human factors of production were raised from this simple mechanistic analysis to human capital.  In modern technical financial analysis, the term "balanced growth" refers to the goal of equal growth of both aggregate human capabilities and physical assets that produce goods and services.

The assumption that labour or workforces could be easily modelled in aggregate began to be challenged in 1950s when the [[tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]], which demanded creativity, begun to produce more than the [[secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] was producing at the time in the most developed countries in the world.  [[File:Clark's Sector model.png|left|400px|right|thumb|Clark's Sector model the for US economy 1850–2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Makes It? Clark's Sector Model for US Economy 1850–2009|url=http://www.63alfred.com/whomakesit/clarksmodel.htm|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]  Accordingly, much more attention was paid to factors that led to success versus failure where human management was concerned.  The role of [[leadership]], [[Aptitude|talent]], even [[celebrity]] was explored.

Today, most theories attempt to break down human capital into one or more components for analysis&lt;ref name="sveiby.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sveiby.com/articles/IntellectualCapital.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216095056/http://www.sveiby.com/articles/IntellectualCapital.html |archive-date=2013-02-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Paolo Magrassi]] (2002) "A Taxonomy of Intellectual Capital", Research Note COM-17-1985, Gartner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sveiby 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sveiby|first=Karl Erik|year=1997|title=The Intangible Asset Monitor|journal=Journal of Human Resource Costing and Accounting|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; – usually called "[[Social capital|intangibles]]".  Most commonly, [[social capital]], the sum of social bonds and relationships, has come to be recognized, along with many synonyms such as goodwill or brand value or [[social cohesion]] or social resilience and related concepts like [[celebrity]] or [[wikt:fame|fame]], as distinct from the [[Aptitude|talent]] that an [[individual capital|individual]] (such as an [[sportsperson|athlete]] has uniquely) has developed that cannot be passed on to others regardless of effort, and those aspects that can be transferred or taught: [[instructional capital]].  Less commonly, some analyses conflate good instructions for health with health itself, or good [[knowledge management]] habits or systems with the instructions they compile and manage, or the "[[intellectual capital]]" of teams&amp;nbsp;– a reflection of their social and instructional capacities, with some assumptions about their individual uniqueness in the context in which they work.  In general these analyses acknowledge that individual trained bodies, teachable ideas or skills, and social influence or persuasion power, are different.

[[Management accounting]] is often concerned with questions of how to model human beings as a [[capital asset]].  However it is broken down or defined,
human capital is vitally important for an organization's success (Crook et al., 2011); human capital increases through education and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 2010, the OECD (the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development) encouraged the governments of advanced economies to embrace policies to increase innovation and knowledge in products and services as an economical path to continued prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist (May 27th 2010). on the web at http://www.economist.com/node/16219687?story_id=16219687&lt;/ref&gt;  International policies also often address [[human capital flight]], which is the loss of talented or trained persons from a country that invested in them, to another country which benefits from their arrival without investing in them.

Studies of [[structural unemployment]] have increasingly focused on a mismatch between the stock of job-specific human capital and the needs of employers.&lt;ref name=Simkovic /&gt; In other words, there is increasingly a recognition that human capital may be specific to particular jobs or tasks and not general and readily transferable.  Recent work has attempted to improve the linkages between education and the needs of the labor market by linking labor market data to education loan pricing.&lt;ref name=Simkovic /&gt;

==Marxist analysis==
[[File:Sabah Sarawak labour advert Kuala Lumpur.JPG|thumb|right|An advertisement for labour from Sabah and Sarawak, seen in Jalan Petaling, Kuala Lumpur.]]
In some way, the idea of "human capital" is similar to [[Karl Marx]]'s concept of [[labor power]]: he thought in [[capitalism]] workers sold their labor power in order to receive income (wages and salaries). But long before Mincer or Becker wrote, Marx pointed to "two disagreeably frustrating facts" with theories that equate wages or salaries with the interest on human capital.

# The worker must actually ''work'', exert his or her mind and body, to earn this "interest." Marx strongly distinguished between one's ''capacity'' to work, [[labor power]], and the activity of working.
# A free worker cannot sell his human capital in one go; it is far from being a liquid asset, even more illiquid than shares and land. He does not sell his skills, but contracts to utilize those skills, in the same way that an industrialist sells his produce, not his machinery. The exception here are slaves, whose human capital can be sold, though the slave does not earn an income himself.

An employer must be receiving a [[Profit (economics)|profit]] from his operations, so that workers must be producing what Marx (under the [[labor theory of value]]) perceived as [[surplus-value]], i.e., doing work beyond that necessary to maintain their [[labor power]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl]].  ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch29.htm volume III, ch. 29 pp. 465–6 of the International Publishers edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Though having "human capital" gives workers some benefits, they are still dependent on the owners of non-human wealth for their livelihood.

The term appears in Marx's article in the ''[[New-York Daily Tribune]]'' "The Emancipation Question," January 17 and 22, 1859, although there the term is used to describe humans who act like a capital to the producers, rather than in the modern sense of "knowledge capital" endowed to or acquired by humans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://marxists.anu.edu.au/archive/marx/works/1858/12/31.htm  ''The Emancipation Question'' in New-York Daily Tribune, January 17 and 22, 1859] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731022259/http://marxists.anu.edu.au/archive/marx/works/1858/12/31.htm |date=2008-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Marxist economists such as Bowles have argued that education leads to higher wages not by increasing human capital, but rather by making workers more compliant and reliable in a corporate environment.&lt;ref name=Simkovic /&gt;

==Importance==
The concept of human capital has relatively more importance in labour-surplus countries. These countries are naturally endowed with more of labour due to high birth rate under the given climatic conditions. The surplus labour in these countries is the human resource available in more abundance than the tangible capital resource. This human resource can be transformed into human capital with effective inputs of education, health and moral values. The transformation of raw human resource into highly productive human resource with these inputs is the process of human capital formation. The problem of scarcity of tangible capital in the labour surplus countries can be resolved by accelerating the rate of human capital formation with both private and public investment in education and health sectors of their national economies. The tangible financial capital is an effective instrument of promoting economic growth of the nation. The intangible human capital, on the other hand, is an instrument of promoting comprehensive development of the nation because human capital is directly related to human development, and when there is human development, the qualitative and quantitative progress of the nation is inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haq|first=Mahbub ul|title=Reflection on Human Development|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; This importance of human capital is explicit in the changed approach of [[United Nations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UN|title=Official website|url=https://www.un.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; towards comparative evaluation of economic development of different nations in the world economy. The United Nations publishes the [[Human Development Report]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Human Development Report|first=UNDP|title=HDR|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; on human development in different nations with the objective of evaluating the rate of human capital formation in these nations.

The statistical indicator of estimating human development in each nation is [[Human Development Index]] (HDI). It is the combination of "[[Life Expectancy Index]]", "[[Education Index]]" and "Income Index". The life expectancy index reveals the standard of health of the population in the country; the education index reveals the educational standard and the literacy ratio of the population; and the income index reveals the standard of living of the population. If all these indices have a rising trend over a long period of time, it is reflected in a rising trend in HDI. Human capital is measured by health, education and quality of [[standard of living]]. Therefore, the components of HDI, viz, Life Expectancy Index, Education Index and Income Index, are directly related to human capital formation within the nation. HDI is indicator of positive correlation between human capital formation and economic development. If HDI increases, there is a higher rate of human capital formation in response to a higher standard of education and health. Similarly, if HDI increases, per capita income of the nation also increases. Implicitly, HDI reveals that the higher is human capital formation due to good levels of health and education, the higher is the per capita income of the nation. This process of human development is the strong foundation of a continuous process of economic development of the nation for a long period of time. This significance of the concept of human capital in generating long-term economic development of the nation cannot be neglected. It is expected that the macroeconomic policies of all the nations are focused towards promotion of human development and subsequently economic development.

Human capital is the backbone of human development and economic development in every nation. Mahroum (2007) suggested that at the macro-level, human capital management is about three key capacities: the capacity to develop talent, the capacity to deploy talent, and the capacity to draw talent from elsewhere. Collectively, these three capacities form the backbone of any country's human capital competitiveness. Recent U.S. research shows that geographic regions that invest in the human capital and economic advancement of immigrants who are already living in their jurisdictions help boost their short- and long-term economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/9/20%20immigrants%20human%20capital%20singer/immigrants%20human%20capital%20singer |title=Brookings Institution, ''Investing in the Human Capital of Immigrants, Strengthening Regional Economies'', September 2012 |access-date=2012-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301191252/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/9/20%20immigrants%20human%20capital%20singer/immigrants%20human%20capital%20singer |archive-date=2014-03-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also strong evidence that organizations that possess and cultivate their human capital outperform other organizations lacking human capital (Crook, Todd, Combs, Woehr, and Ketchen, 2011).

==Cumulative growth==
Human capital is distinctly different from the tangible monetary capital due to the extraordinary characteristic of human capital to grow cumulatively over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Investopedia |title=Human Capital: The most overlooked Asset Class |author=David Allison |url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/younginvestors/09/human-capital.asp#axzz1Wb8QpjGs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of tangible monetary capital is not always linear due to the shocks of [[business cycle]]s. During the period of prosperity, monetary capital grows at relatively higher rate while during the period of [[recession]] and depression, there is deceleration of monetary capital. On the other hand, human capital has uniformly rising rate of growth over a long period of time because the foundation of this human capital is laid down by the educational and health inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Becker|first=Gary|title=Human Capital: A theoretical and empirical analysis with special reference to Education|year=1994|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current generation is qualitatively developed by the effective inputs of education and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=W. Lee|title=Education, Income and Human Capital|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The future generation is more benefited by the advanced research in the field of education and health, undertaken by the current generation. Therefore, the educational and health inputs create more productive impacts upon the future generation and the future generation becomes superior to the current generation. In other words, the productive capacity of future generation increases more than that of current generation. Therefore, rate of human capital formation in the future generation happens to be more than the rate of human capital formation in the current generation. This is the cumulative growth of human capital formation generated by superior quality of manpower in the succeeding generation as compared to the preceding generation.

===India===

In India, rate of human capital formation has consistently increased after Independence due to qualitative improvement in each generation. In the second decade of the 21st century, the third generation of India's population is active in the workforce of India. This third generation is qualitatively the most superior human resource in India. It has developed the service sector of India with the export of [[financial services]], software services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bagde|first=Surendrakumar|title=Human Capital and Economic Development in India|url=http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/research/251full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; tourism services and improved the [[invisible balance]] of India's balance of payments. The rapid growth of the Indian economy in response to improvement in the service sector is evidence of cumulative growth of human capital in India.

==Criticism==
Some [[labor economics|labor economists]] have criticized the Chicago-school theory, claiming that it tries to explain all differences in wages and salaries in terms of human capital.  One of the leading alternatives, advanced by [[Michael Spence]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz]], is "signaling theory".  According to signaling theory, education does not lead to increased human capital, but rather acts as a mechanism by which workers with superior innate abilities can signal those abilities to prospective employers and so gain above average wages.&lt;ref name=Simkovic /&gt;

The concept of human capital can be infinitely elastic, including unmeasurable variables such as personal character or connections with insiders (via family or fraternity). This theory has had a significant share of study in the field proving that wages can be higher for employees on aspects other than human capital. Some variables that have been identified in the literature of the past few decades include, gender and nativity wage differentials, discrimination in the work place, and socioeconomic status.

The prestige of a [[credentialism|credential]] may be as important as the knowledge gained in determining the value of an education. This points to the existence of [[market failure|market imperfections]] such as non-competing groups and [[labor-market segmentation]]. In segmented labor markets, the "return on human capital" differs between comparably skilled labor-market groups or segments. An example of this is [[discrimination]] against minority or female employees.

Following Becker, the human capital literature often distinguishes between "specific" and "general" human capital. Specific human capital refers to skills or knowledge that is useful only to a single employer or industry, whereas general human capital (such as literacy) is useful to all employers. Economists view firm-specific human capital as risky, since firm closure or industry decline leads to skills that cannot be transferred (the evidence on the quantitative importance of firm specific capital is unresolved).

Human capital is central to debates about [[Social welfare|welfare]], [[education]], [[health care]], and [[retirement]]..

In 2004, "human capital" ({{lang-de|Humankapital}}) was named the [[Un-word of the year|German Un-Word of the Year]] by a jury of linguistic scholars, who considered the term inappropriate and inhumane, as individuals would be degraded and their abilities classified according to economically relevant quantities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l42/l0/F.html#featuredEntry Spiegel Online: ''Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort!''] (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

"Human capital" is often confused with human development. The UN suggests "Human development denotes both the process of widening people's choices and improving their well-being".&lt;ref name="hdr.undp.org"&gt;Composite indices — HDI and beyond,http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/indices/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114183701/http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/indices/ |date=2013-11-14 }}, retrieved July 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Human Development indices suggest that human capital is merely a means to the end of human development: "Theories of human capital formation and human resource development view human beings as means to increased income and wealth rather than as ends. These theories are concerned with human beings as inputs to increasing production".&lt;ref name="hdr.undp.org"/&gt;

==Intangibility and portability==
Human capital is an [[intangible asset]], and it is not owned by the firm that employs it and is generally not fungible.  Specifically, individuals arrive at 9am and leave at 5pm (in the conventional office model) taking most of their knowledge and relationships with them.

Human capital when viewed from a time perspective consumes time in one of these key activities:
# Knowledge (activities involving one employee),
# Collaboration (activities involving more than 1 employee),
# Processes (activities specifically focused on the knowledge and collaborative activities generated by organizational structure&amp;nbsp;– such as silo impacts, internal politics, etc.) and
# Absence (annual leave, sick leave, holidays, etc.).

Despite the lack of formal ownership, firms can and do gain from high levels of training, in part because it creates a [[corporate culture]] or vocabulary teams use to create cohesion.

In recent economic writings the concept of [[firm-specific human capital]], which includes those social relationships, individual instincts, and instructional details that are of value within one firm (but not in general), appears by way of explaining some labour mobility issues and such phenomena as [[golden handcuffs]].  Workers can be more valuable where they are simply for having acquired this knowledge, these skills and these instincts.  Accordingly, the firm gains for their unwillingness to leave and market talents elsewhere.

==Risk==
When human capital is assessed by activity based costing via time allocations it becomes possible to assess human capital risk. Human capital risks can be identified if HR processes in organizations are studied in detail. Human capital risk occurs when the organization operates below attainable operational excellence levels.  For example, if a firm could reasonably reduce errors and rework (the Process component of human capital) from 10,000 hours per annum to 2,000 hours with attainable technology, the difference of 8,000 hours is human capital risk.  When wage costs are applied to this difference (the 8,000 hours) it becomes possible to financially value human capital risk within an organizational perspective.

Risk accumulates in four primary categories:
# Absence activities (activities related to employees not showing up for work such as sick leave, industrial action, etc.).  Unavoidable absence is referred to as Statutory Absence.  All other categories of absence are termed "Controllable Absence";
# Collaborative activities are related to the expenditure of time between more than one employee within an organizational context.  Examples include: meetings, phone calls, instructor led training, etc.;
# Knowledge Activities are related to time expenditures by a single person and include finding/retrieving information, research, email, messaging, blogging, information analysis, etc.; and
# Process activities are knowledge and collaborative activities that result due to organizational context such as errors/rework, manual data transformation, stress, politics, etc.

==Corporate finance==
In [[corporate finance]], human capital is one of the three primary components of [[intellectual capital]] (which, in addition to tangible assets, comprise the entire value of a company).  Human capital is the value that the employees of a business provide through the application of skills, know-how and expertise.&lt;ref name="Maddocks"&gt;Maddocks, J. &amp; Beaney, M. 2002. See the invisible and intangible. Knowledge Management, March, 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an organization’s combined human capability for solving business problems. Human capital is inherent in people and cannot be owned by an organization. Therefore, human capital leaves an organization when people leave. Human capital also encompasses how effectively an organization uses its people resources as measured by creativity and innovation. A company’s reputation as an employer affects the human capital it draws.&lt;ref name="sveiby.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sveiby 1997"/&gt;

==Measurement of human capital==
===World Economic Forum Global Human Capital Index===
Since 2012 the [[World Economic Forum]] has annually published its Global Human Capital Report, which includes the Global Human Capital Index (GHCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Global Human Capital Report 2017 |url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-human-capital-report-2017 |website=World Economic Forum |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 2017 edition, 130 countries&lt;ref name=Observatory&gt;{{cite web |title=Índice de Capital Humano 2017 |url=http://www.competitividad.org.do/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Indice-de-Capital-Humano-2017.pdf |website=Observatorio de Competitividad |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; are ranked from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) according to the quality of their investments in human capital. Norway is at the top, with 77.12.&lt;ref name=Observatory/&gt;

===World Bank Human Capital Index===
In October 2018, the [[World Bank]] published the Human Capital Index (HCI) as a measurement of economic success. The Index ranks countries according to how much is invested in education and health care for young people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45816049 "Not pounds and pence - here's a different way to measure our wealth"], BBC, 11.10,2018&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on ''The Changing Nature of Work''&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; showcases the Index and explains its importance given the impact of technology on labor markets and the future of work.

===Other methods===
A new measure of expected human capital calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by the [[The Lancet|Lancet]] in September 2018. [[Finland]] had the highest level of expected human capital: 28·4 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years. [[Niger]] had the lowest at less than 1·6 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lim |first1=Stephen |last2=et |first2=al |title=Measuring human capital: a systematic analysis of 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016 |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31941-X/fulltext |accessdate=5 November 2018 |publisher=Lancet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring the human capital index of individual firms is also possible: a survey is made on issues like training or compensation,&lt;ref name=Community&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Human Capital Index ? |url=http://www.chrmglobal.com/Qanda/54/1/What-is-Human-Capital-Index-.html |website=Community for Human Resource Management |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a value between 0 (worst) and 100 (best) is obtained. Enterprises which rank high are shown to add value to shareholders.&lt;ref name=Community/&gt;

'''Eugenie V. Peterson''' ({{lang-ru|Евгения Васильевна Петерсон}}; May 12, 1899 – April 25, 2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Aboy|first = Adriana|title = Indra Devi's Legacy|publisher = [[Hinduism Today]]|year = 2002|url = http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=3846|accessdate = 2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as '''Indra Devi''', was a Russian [[yoga]] teacher who was an early disciple of [[Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya]].

==Early years==
Born in [[Riga]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Michelle Goldberg's book 'The Goddess Pose' paints vivid picture of yoga pioneer Indra Devi|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-summer-books-goldberg-20150531-story.html|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date = 28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian Empire, to Vasili Peterson, a [[Sweden|Swedish]] bank director and Alejandra Labunskaia, a [[Russians|Russian]] noblewoman, Eugenie attended drama school in [[Moscow]] as a girl and escaped to [[Berlin]] with her mother as the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power in 1917. In Berlin, she became an actress and dancer.&lt;ref name=nyt.obit/&gt;

==India==
Devi's fascination with [[India]] began at 15 when she read a book by poet-philosopher [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and a yoga instruction book by [[Yogi Ramacharaka]]. In 1927, she sailed for India and adopted a stage name that would sound Hindu (using "dev", the [[Hindi language|Hindi]] root for "god") and acted in [[Indian Cinema|Indian films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rolfe |first=Lionel |title=Indra Devi was not just a nice old lady|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/lionel-rolfe/indra-devi-was-not-just-a_b_7078842.html|journal=Huffington Post|date = 17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, she married Jan Strakaty, a commercial attache to the [[Czechoslovak]] consulate in [[Bombay]].

The famous Yoga guru [[Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya]] accepted her as a student, only after the [[Maharaja of Mysore]] spoke on her behalf, and in 1938 she became the first foreign woman among dedicated yogis. She studied alongside [[B. K. S. Iyengar|B.K.S Iyengar]] and [[K. Pattabhi Jois]] who would also go on to become world famous yoga teachers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/30/world/indra-devi-102-dies-taught-yoga-to-stars-and-leaders.html|title=Indra Devi, 102, Dies; Taught Yoga to Stars and Leaders|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=2002-04-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;. She met every challenge Krishnamacharya set out for her and was so successful that the guru asked her to work as a yoga teacher, when he learned that her husband was to be transferred to China and she would leave India.

==China==
In 1939, she held what is believed to be the first Yoga classes in China and opened a school in Shanghai at the house of [[Madame Chiang Kai-shek]], wife of the nationalist leader and a new yoga enthusiast.&lt;ref name=nyt.obit/&gt;  There were many Americans and Russians among her pupils. More and more people began to call her [[Mataji]], which means mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.amazingwomeninhistory.com/indra-devi-mother-of-western-yoga/|title=Indra Devi, Mother of Western Yoga - Amazing Women In History|date=2012-10-02|work=Amazing Women In History|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indra Devi gave lectures on yoga and free lessons in orphanages.

==United States==

Miller,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSsr=41&amp;GSmcid=48670128&amp;GRid=149726783&amp; Jean R. Miller on findagrave.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne T. Hill]], Indra Devi, Los Angeles 1965]]
Following the unexpected death of her husband in 1946&lt;ref name="nyt.obit" /&gt;, with eight years of teaching experience gained in India, the renowned guru left for the United States in 1947. A year later she opened a yoga studio in Hollywood.

Indra Devi used her Indian teachings to lay claim to her own forms of yoga, these claims included Indian yoga [[asanas]], breathing techniques such as the Indian form of [[Pranayama]] and diets. Later in life, Indra Devi stressed that her method relied on the Indian classical yoga of [[Patanjali]].

She taught [[Greta Garbo]], [[Eva Gabor]], and [[Gloria Swanson]]. Also, among her students were [[Robert Ryan]], [[Jennifer Jones]], and the violinist [[Yehudi Menuhin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/30/world/indra-devi-102-dies-taught-yoga-to-stars-and-leaders.html Indra Devi, 102, Dies — Taught Yoga to Stars and Leaders — Obituary] nytimes.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to popular belief, there is no record of her ever teaching [[Marilyn Monroe]]. While Monroe did own her book "Forever Young, Forever Happy", there is no proof that the two women met in person. A popular photo that shows [[Eva Gabor]] training with Devi in 1960 is commonly mistaken for Monroe.

In 1953 Indra married the well-known German physician Dr. Sigfrid Knauer. In the mid-1950s she was granted American citizenship and put her Indra Devi pseudonym in her new passport.

Indra recorded several instructional talks on yoga in the 1970s, including "Renew Your Life with Yoga."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Renew-Your-Life-Yoga-Indra/dp/1579704794&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==
In 1961 Indra Devi opened the Indra Devi Foundation in [[Tecate]], México, in [[El Vallecito#Cerro del Cuchumá|Rancho Cuchumá]]. Mataji was very close to [[Sathya Sai Baba]] a Hindu guru and she traveled often from her Yoga Foundation in Tecate Mexico to [[Bangalore]] and [[Puttaparthi]]. Indra Devi closed the International Training Center for Yoga Teachers in 1977 and moved with her very ill husband to Bangalore. In 1984 she made a trip to Sri Lanka with her husband Doctor Sigfrid Knauer where he died the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSmcid=48670128&amp;GRid=148920628&amp; Sigfrid Knauer on findagrave.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and death==

'''Irene Kirke Leache''' (1839 — December 2, 1900) was an American teacher and the co-founder of the Leache-Wood Seminary, one of the premier women's schools in the post-Civil War era in Norfolk, Virginia. Posthumously, the Irene Leache Library Association was established in her name to honor her. In 1914, a further memorial, the Irene Leach Art Association was formed to house artworks donated to create a museum in her name, which was the first museum in Norfolk.

==Early life==
Irene Kirke Leache was born in 1839 on a farm, Wood Park, in [[Fauquier County, Virginia]] to Jane Roberts (née Hunton) and Dr. Jesse Willett Leache.&lt;ref name=O1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chrysler.org/about-the-museum/our-history/two-women-one-remarkable-gift/ |title=Two Women, One Remarkable Gift|website=Chrysler Museum of Art|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Late Dr. J.

She left the family home for Westmoreland County when she was hired by the Carter family to teach their children. At the onset of the Civil War, she returned to her home to find their crops ruined. With the war being fought on their land, the family left the area.&lt;ref name=O1/&gt;

When her mother died in the latter part of 1865, Leache accepted the responsibility for raising her younger siblings,&lt;ref name=O1/&gt; simultaneously working at several positions as a governess or teacher at female seminaries.&lt;ref name="McCarty" /&gt; In 1868, she became a teacher in [[Winchester, Virginia]] at the female seminary, Angerona. There she met [[Anna Cogswell Wood]] and became her tutor.&lt;ref name=O1/&gt; Leache was 29 and Wood was 18.&lt;ref name="Censer" /&gt;

==Leache-Wood Seminary==
[[File:The original Leache-Wood Seminary.jpg|thumb|Leache-Wood Seminary]]

At the urging of the Presbyterian pastor, [[George Dod Armstrong]], they opened their own school, Leache-Wood Seminary, in 1871 in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=O1/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarty" /&gt; In the midst of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], the city was rebuilding and the seminary was the only proper female school in the area&lt;ref name="Coleman" /&gt; and Armstrong urged his parishioners to send their daughters to the school.&lt;ref name="McCarty" /&gt;

The school became immediately successful, and by the end of their first year it was free of all debt.&lt;ref name="McCarty" /&gt; By 1880, they taught girls from the age of three, with education from kindergarten through higher learning. Their well-rounded curriculum included the arts, in which they put on theatre productions, and music. They were known for providing a high-quality education.&lt;ref name="Censer" /&gt; In 1882, Leache-Wood founded the "Fireside Club" as an extension of their cultural evenings. They successfully operated the school for twenty years.&lt;ref name="McCarty" /&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Annie Cogswell Wood.jpg|thumb|left|Annie Cogswell Wood, Chrysler Museum of Art's Library Archives]]

Their relationship was loving one. Wood described Leache as having eyes that were "lucid with thought, lucent with love."&lt;ref name="Censer" /&gt; They created and hosted the Fireside Club at their apartment on Saturday nights for women and men of Norfolk. Leache and Wood traveled internationally during the summer months.&lt;ref name="Censer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Turner Censer|title=The Reconstruction of White Southern Womanhood, 1865--1895|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TkvIt_fzwPYC&amp;pg=PA176|date=30 September 2003|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=978-0-8071-2921-0|pages=175–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women traveled to Europe in early 1891, after selling the school.&lt;ref name="Coleman" /&gt; They traveled extensively visiting Egypt, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain and Sweden.&lt;ref name="McCarty" /&gt; They returned to the United States for several months in the fall of 1898, but by June of the following year, returned to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=En Route to Enrope (sic)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12647157/en_route_to_enrope_sic_the/|accessdate=26 July 2017|publisher=''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]''|date=29 June 1899|location=Norfolk, Virginia|page=5|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and death==
[[File:Luigi Guglielmi, Irene Leache, marble, ca. 1903.jpg|thumb|Luigi Guglielmi, ''Irene Leache'', marble, ca. 1903]]

By the following year, Leache became ill. She and Wood returned to the United States, where Leache died in Norfolk on December 2 from a respiratory illness.&lt;ref name=O1/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarty" /&gt; Wood went back to Italy and started sending back art works to build the Irene Leache Memorial Art Collection. She also commissioned a white marble bust of Irene to Italian artist Luigi Giglielmini. Wood and Leache are both buried at Elmwood Cemetery, Norfolk City, Virginia.&lt;ref name=O1 /&gt; After Leache's death, Wood wrote ''The Story of a Friendship'' about their relationship.&lt;ref name="Censer" /&gt; 

==The Irene Leache Memorial Foundation==
Posthumously, the Irene Leache Library Association was established by former students in her name to honor her in the year of her death. In 1914, a further memorial, the Irene Leach Art Association was formed to house artworks donated to create a museum in her name, which was the first museum in Norfolk.{{harv|Earle|2008|p=6}} It was founded by Wood, to honor her friend, and later incorporated into three rooms in the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk. The Irene Leach Memorial also promoted a Biennial Art Show for more than 80 years, from 1918 to 1999, and an annual Literary Contest and now grants literary, performing (theater, dance, music), and visual arts awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chrysler.org/files/resources/irene-leache-brochure.pdf|title=The Irene Leache Memorial Foundation Promotes the Cultural Arts and Maintains and Builds the Irene Leache Memorial Art Collection|website=Chrysler Museum of Art|accessdate=July 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iriss''' is a Scottish charitable company, based in Glasgow, Scotland which acts to make improvements to how the social services workforce in Scotland makes use of knowledge and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iriss.org.uk/about-us |title=About us | publisher= Institute for Research and Innovation in Social Services (IRISS) |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2003, the '''Scottish Institute for Excellence in Social Work Education''' (SIESWE) was established as a sector-wide collaboration of the nine Scottish universities teaching social work with the objective of bringing about transformational change in the education and training of Scotland's future [[social work]]ers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2003/07/3858 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170424232051/http://www.gov.scot/News/Releases/2003/07/3858 |archivedate=24 April 2017 |title=New Institute to promote social work education |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=30 July 2003 |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stated goals were:

* Achieving the policy objectives of the then new social work honours degree
* Strengthening the evidence-base for practice and education for practice
* Supporting the implementation of an employee development framework for the whole social services workforce

One of the first projects was the creation of the Learning Exchange, a digital repository, or library of bite sized chunks of learning or [[learning object]]s.

In 2007, SIESWE changed its name to Iriss which reflected an extension of the scope to include the social care workforce.

==Work Programmes==
Iriss's work is based on three inter-related programmes:
* Evidence-informed practice&lt;ref name="Evidence &amp; Policy"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tpp/ep/2014/00000010/00000004/art00006 |title=Embedding research into practice through innovation and creativity: a case study from social services |first1=Alison |last1=Petch |first2=Claire |last2=Lightowler |first3=Lisa |last3=Pattoni |first4=Ian |last4=Watson |journal=Evidence &amp; Policy: A Journal of Research, Debate and Practice |volume=10 |number=4 |date=November 2014 |pages=555–564}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Innovation and improvement
* Knowledge media

Projects are organised under a number of themes.

==Principles==
The principles on which Iriss operates are set out in the strategy for 2012-15.&lt;ref&gt;Designs for the future: Iriss strategy 2012-2015 - http://www.iriss.org.uk/sites/default/files/iriss-designs-for-the-future.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In summary:
* The work of Iriss will complement rather than duplicate the work of other agencies
* The work will be responsive to a wide range of stakeholders, including Scottish Government, the Iriss Board, people who use services, unpaid careers, local authority social services staff, provider agencies, national bodies, universities, colleges and the wider community
* Iriss will capture stakeholder feedback and make that feedback visible
* The three programme areas will be interlocking
* Work will focus on the core business of the social services community
* Approaches will be varied and selected by appropriateness for the task
* Iriss will monitor impact of its projects
* Activities should create a high profile for the organisation
* All Iriss staff should feel a sense of ownership of Iriss activities
* There should be a focus on cost-effectiveness
* A range of funding streams will be accessed
* Iriss will promote the effective and appropriate use of technology, demystify it and advocate the removal barriers than prevent effective use of web-based tools and services
* Iriss will communicate effectively using a variety of social media

==Learning Exchange==

In 2005, the [http://lx.iriss.org.uk Learning Exchange] was launched as the world's first interactive library of digital learning resources for social work education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/education/chalkface-1-1109524 |title=Chalkface |work=[[The Scotsman]] |publisher=[[Johnston Press]] |date=15 November 2005 |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This repository is catalogued in accordance with international [[metadata standards]] and [[Learning object metadata]], allowing interoperability with other systems. In particular the intention was that multimedia learning objects could be downloaded as IMS&lt;ref&gt;IMS is a non-profit standards organisation concerned with establishing interoperability for learning systems and learning content - http://www.imsglobal.org&lt;/ref&gt; packages and uploaded into virtual learning environments in higher education institutions.

Originally the Learning Exchange was built on IntraLibrary software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://app.dundee.ac.uk/pressreleases/prnov05/learnexchange.html |title=Scottish Institute Launches 'The Learning Exchange' |publisher=[[University of Dundee]] |date=14 November 2005 |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and access restricted to students and staff of the higher educational institutions in Scotland engaged in teaching social work. Access was password protected using the [[Athens (access and identity management service)|Athens Eduserve]] authentication system.  Subsequently the Learning Exchange was added to the [[NHS Education for Scotland]] (NES) portfolio of content accessible via Athens Eduserve.  This made Learning Exchange available to the higher education sector and the entire social services workforce.

In practice much of the content of the Learning Exchange did not require password protection, partly because in 2008 Iriss adopted a policy of releasing its own content using [[Creative Commons]] licensing. Password protection was therefore removed and a simple search interface OpenSearch created&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://code.google.com/p/sruopensearch/ |title=sruopensearch |publisher=code.google.com |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which queried the database by [[Search/Retrieve via URL|SRU]].

In 2010, the Learning Exchange was rebuilt using [[Drupal]], an open source content management system.

The ability to allow metadata harvesting by third parties means that Learning Exchange content is automatically searchable by Social Services Knowledge Scotland&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssks.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; (SSKS), a portal to social service knowledge and information created by [[NHS Education for Scotland]] (NES) in partnership with Iriss, Scottish Social Services Learning Networks and the [[Social Care Institute for Excellence]].

==Multimedia==

In 2005 Iriss began creating web-based multimedia learning objects based on scenarios devised by social work educators, scripted, professional actors cast, and filmed by professional filmmakers. Examples include:
* Imagining the Future, a creative exploration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://content.iriss.org.uk/2025/|title = Imagining the Future - a creative exploration|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; looks at what will social care, support and community be like in Scotland 2025.  This key piece of research was released in November 2014 and was met with favourable review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/columnists/inside-track-social-work-meets-the-hunger-games.25960290|title = Inside Track: Social work meets the Hunger Games|last = Naysmith|first = Stephen|date =26 November 2014|work =[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |publisher=[[Newsquest]] |accessdate =17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Children, Families and Child Protection&lt;ref&gt;Children, Families and Child Protection - http://www.iriss.org.uk/childprotection, accessed 10 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on the legal, ethical and practice issues emerging from a child protection case scenario.  
* The Assessment Triangle&lt;ref&gt;The Assessment Triangle - http://www.iriss.org.uk/opencontent/assessment, accessed 10 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted within the development of the Integrated Assessment Framework of [[Getting it Right for Every Child - GIRFEC|GIRFEC]]. 
* The Golden Bridge&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iriss.ac.uk/goldenbridge&lt;/ref&gt; documents the migration of [[Home Children]] from Scotland to Canada in the late 19th and early 20th century. It includes artefacts, such as photographs, from [[Quarriers]] organisation, a major voluntary sector childcare agency.

==Audio and Video==

In 2006, Iriss began recording research seminars and other events as an effective and inexpensive way of capturing and sharing knowledge. These recordings were made available as a podcast&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iriss.org.uk/audio&lt;/ref&gt; either direct from the Iriss website or from the iTunes Store.

In June 2012 the podcast series was superseded by [http://iriss.fm IRISS.FM] [[internet radio]]

Iriss also uses Vimeo,&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/iriss&lt;/ref&gt; for video streaming.

==Knowledge Management Strategy==

Iriss collaborated with [[NHS Education for Scotland]] (NES) and other stakeholders to create The Knowledge Management Strategy for the Social Services which was derived from Changing Lives.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Executive (2006) Report of the recommendations made by the 21st Century Social Work Review Group for the future of social services in Scotland. http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/02/02094408/0, Accessed 29 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The Strategy  stresses the importance of a workforce confident and competent in the use of the technologies that allow them to access and share knowledge.

The Knowledge Management Strategy for the Social Services was revised and new edition &lt;ref&gt;A Strategy and Action Plan for Embedding Knowledge in Practice in Scotland's Social Services http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2012/10/4809&lt;/ref&gt; published by the Scottish Government  in November 2012

As the ubiquity of the web has grown, new skills are required, known collectively as [[information literacy]]: ‘the ability to find, evaluate and use digital information effectively, efficiently and ethically'.&lt;ref&gt;For more definitions see {{cite web|url=http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions/Definitions.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204091732/http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions/Definitions.aspx |archivedate= 4 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with [[NHS Education for Scotland]] Iriss developed a [http://www.iriss.org.uk/project/information-literacy-cyclel series of manuals] aimed at helping social services practitioners develop their information literacy skills, as well as a simple interactive web-based introductory tutorial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iriss.org.uk/informationliteracy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence informed practice==
Iriss has developed a number of tools and services to promote and foster the use of evidence to inform practice. [http://toolkit.iriss.org.uk/  Confidence through Evidence] is a toolkit designed to help practitioners acquire, assess, adapt and apply evidence in practice. A complementary [http://www.iriss.org.uk/project/library-evidence-summaries library of evidence summaries] was created within the Learning Exchange.

A [http://www.iriss.org.uk/project/champion-network Champions Network] has been established to foster links between Iriss and social services workforce in both the statutory and voluntary sectors.

The [http://www.iriss.org.uk/services/research-advice-service Research Advice Service] was set up to support the social care workers carrying out their own research.

'''Joint Entrance Examination – Main''' ('''JEE-Main'''), formerly '''All India Engineering Entrance Examination''' ('''AIEEE'''), is an examination organised by the [[National Testing Agency]] (NTA) in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jeemain.nic.in/webinfo/Public/Home.aspx|title=Official Website|website=jeemain.nic.in|access-date=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced in the year 2002, this national level competitive test is for admission to various undergraduate engineering and architecture courses in institutes accepting the AIEEE score, mainly 31 [[National Institutes of Technology]] (NITs) and 23 [[Indian Institute of Information Technology]] (IIITs).&lt;ref name=part /&gt;

The examination, originally called  sometimes AIEEE, was renamed as Joint Entrance Examination (Main) in April 2017. The AIEEE  was generally held on the last Sunday of April and results were announced in the last week of May or the first week of June. Post the rename, the exam is held in the first week of April. Candidates are ranked on an all-India basis and on state basis. Thus, they get an All India Rank (AIR) and a State Rank (SR).

From 2019, JEE Main will be conducted two times in a year and it will be conducted by [[National Testing Agency]] (NTA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=JEE Main Registrations 2019 to begin from this date: Check eligibility criteria, important dates here |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/notification/story/jee-main-registrations-2019-to-begin-from-this-date-1315650-2018-08-16 |accessdate=17 August 2018 |work=[[India Today]] |date=16 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The examination consists of only two papers: Paper 1 for [[B.E.]]/[[BTech]] courses and Paper 2 for [[BArch]] courses. A candidate can opt for any or both the papers. Candidates attempting Paper 1 can select one of the two modes of writing the test. 1) Pen &amp; paper 2) Online. Paper 1 has three subject sections: Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. Each one of the 3 subject sections consists of 30 questions each with equal weightage for every question. All questions are [[multiple choice]] objective-type questions each of which has four choices. Out of the four choices for a given question, only one choice is correct. Every correct answer will receive 4 marks each and every incorrectly attempted question will receive a negative marking of -1 mark. There is no negative marking applied if the question is left unanswered. Paper 2 has three sections: Mathematics, Drawing, and Aptitude. Mathematics, and Aptitude sections have multiple choice objective-type questions and the Drawing section has drawing-based questions. The duration of each paper is three hours. Candidates are not allowed to carry any textual material, calculators, logarithmic tables or electronic devices into the examination hall. The number of questions and their maximum marks have been variable through the years. The questions are based on a syllabus that is common to syllabi of all the [[Boards of Education in India|state boards in India]] and the Central Board of Secondary Education. Candidates can opt for question papers either in English or in [[Hindi language]]. For admission to [[BTech]] or [[B.E.]] courses in the participating institutes the candidate is required to take the Paper 1; for admission to [[BArch]] or B. Planning courses the candidate is required to take Paper 2. 
The examination was conducted in offline pen and paper mode till 2010. In 2011, as per the orders of the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]], CBSE conducted Paper 1 in [[Computer Based Test|Computer-Based-Test]] mode for the first one lakh candidates who opted for the same, while the remaining students took the examination in the conventional pen and paper mode.&lt;ref name=online&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-11-22/india/28269309_1_online-exam-aieee-architecture-entrance-examination|title=1L students to take AIEEE online|author=The Times of India|date=22 November 2010|accessdate= |work=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The number of attempts which a candidate can avail at the examination is limited to three in consecutive years. {{as of|2018}}, the top 224,000 rankers of JEE (Main) will qualify to appear for the second and final level of examination: JEE (Advanced)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bhandary|first1=Shreya|title=Eligibility criteria for JEE Advanced 2018 released, more students can appear for exam|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/eligibility-criteria-for-jee-advanced-2018-released-more-students-can-appear-for-exam/story-C03g0bGpOJ68lLgQoIVcuL_amp.html|accessdate=24 January 2018|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=30 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]] announced plans to replace JEE by 2013 with a common entrance test for all government engineering colleges which will be called [[Indian Science Engineering Eligibility Test (ISEET)|ISEET]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sify.com/news/iit-jee-likely-to-be-abolished-by-2013-news-education-kcqtkdjiggf.html |title=IIT-JEE likely to be abolished by 2013|work=sify.com |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blog.eduflix.tv/2012/02/iseet-to-replace-iit-jee-and-aieee/ |title=ISEET to replace IIT JEE and AIEEE|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, MHRD proposes to set up National Testing Service, which will be an autonomous and self-sustained agency to conduct this new common entrance test.

==Counselling==
[[Image:Central Counselling Board logo.png|150px|thumb|Logo of the Central Counselling Board]]

For the academic session 2017-18, around 12 lakh candidates appeared in JEE Main 2017. The number of participating institutes of JEE Main also witnessed an increase with addition of 3 new IIITs and 2 GFTIs.

23 [[Indian Institutes of Information Technology]] (IIITs)

31 [[National Institutes of Technology]] (NITs)

23 [[Indian Institutes of Technology|Indian Institute of Technology]] (IITs)

20 [[Government Funded Technical Institutes]] (GFTIs)

[[Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur|Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology]] (IIEST), Shibpur

Several other Institutes spread across the country
The Central Counselling Board coordinates the admissions to the under-graduate courses in the participating institutes. Only small percentage of students taking the test are eligible for central counselling or state-specific or category-specific counselling on basis of their AIR. Counseling for SC/ST candidates and SC/ST physically handicapped candidates is done on the first two days.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Then the physically handicapped in the Open (OP) category are counselled.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

As declared by the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]] (MHRD), 50% of the total seats in NITs and CFTIs are offered through Home State Quota, while 50% are reserved for Other State Quota or All India Quota. In other words, candidates who qualify JEE Main and are eligible for admissions into NITs and CFTIs, will be offered admission as per Home State and All India/Other State Quota.

'''Kansas State University (KSU)''', commonly shortened to '''Kansas State''' or '''K-State''', is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] with its main [[campus]] in [[Manhattan, Kansas|Manhattan]], [[Kansas]], United States. Kansas State was opened as the state's [[land-grant college]] in 1863 – the first public institution of higher learning in the state of Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collections of the Kansas State Historical Society Volume 6|publisher=State of Kansas|year=1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xno1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1863statutes"&gt;{{cite book|title=General Laws of the State of Kansas|publisher=State of Kansas|year=1863|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U98OAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a record high enrollment of 24,766 students for the Fall 2014 semester.&lt;ref name="Enrollment" /&gt;

The university is classified as one of 115 research universities with highest research activity (R1) by the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]]. Kansas State's academic offerings are administered through nine colleges, including the [[Veterinary medicine in the United States|College of Veterinary Medicine]] and the [[Kansas State University Polytechnic Campus|College of Technology and Aviation]] in Salina. Graduate degrees offered include 65 master's degree programs and 45 doctoral degrees.

[[Satellite campus|Branch campuses]] are in [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]] and [[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]]. The Kansas State University Polytechnic Campus in Salina is home to the College of Technology and Aviation. The Olathe Innovation Campus has a focus on graduate work in research bioenergy, animal health, plant science and food safety and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = K-State Olathe Innovation Campus, Inc. | url = http://kstateoic.ksu.edu/ | format = English | accessdate = April 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Kansas State University, originally named '''Kansas State Agricultural College''', was founded in Manhattan on February 16, 1863, during the [[American Civil War]], as a [[land-grant university|land-grant institution]] under the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]].&lt;ref name="1863statutes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Willard"&gt;{{cite book | last = Willard | first = Julius | title = History of Kansas State College of Agriculture and Applied Science | publisher = Kansas State College Press | year = 1940 | url = http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=hearth;cc=hearth;rgn=full%20text;idno=5725255;didno=5725255;view=image;seq=0003;node=5725255%3A3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was the first land-grant college created under the Morrill Act.&lt;ref name="Willard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nation"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The National Schools of Science | journal = The Nation | page = 409 | date = November 21, 1867 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Mf0xAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA409 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; K-State is the third-oldest school in the [[Big 12 Conference]] and the oldest public institution of higher learning in the state of Kansas.&lt;ref name="1863statutes" /&gt;

The effort to establish the school began in 1861, the year that [[Kansas]] was admitted to the [[United States]].  One of the new [[Kansas Legislature|state legislature's]] top priorities involved establishing a state university. That year, the delegation from Manhattan introduced a bill to convert the private [[Blue Mont Central College]] in Manhattan, incorporated in 1858, into the state university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Willard | first = Julius | title = Bluemont Central College, the Forerunner of Kansas State College | journal = Kansas Historical Quarterly | date = May 1945 | url = http://www.kshs.org/publicat/khq/1945/45_6_willard.htm | accessdate = January 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But the bill establishing the university in Manhattan was controversially [[veto]]ed by Governor [[Charles L.

When the college opened for its first session on September 2, 1863, it became only the [[List of mixed-sex colleges and universities in the United States|second public institution of higher learning to admit women and men equally]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Frontier"&gt;{{cite book | last = Olson | first = Kevin | title = Frontier Manhattan | publisher = University Press of Kansas | year = 2012 | pages = | isbn = 978-0-7006-1832-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enrollment for the first session totaled 52 students: 26 men and 26 women.&lt;ref name="Willard" /&gt;  Twelve years after opening, the university moved its main campus from the location of [[Blue Mont Central College]] to its present site in 1875.&lt;ref name="Willard" /&gt; The original site is now occupied by Central National Bank of Manhattan and Founders Hill Apartments.

The early years of the institution witnessed debate over whether the college should provide a focused agricultural education or a full [[liberal arts]] education. During this era, the tenor of the school shifted with the tenure of college presidents.  For example, President [[John Alexander Anderson|John A. Anderson]] (1873–1879) favored a limited education and President [[George Fairchild|George T.

In November 1928, the school was accredited by the Association of American Universities (AAU) as a school whose graduates were deemed capable of advanced graduate work.&lt;ref name="Willard" /&gt; The name of the school was changed in 1931 to '''Kansas State College of Agriculture and Applied Science'''.  In 1959, the Kansas legislature changed the name again to '''Kansas State University of Agriculture and Applied Science''' to reflect a growing number of graduate programs. However, since then, the "Agriculture and Applied Science" portion has usually been omitted even from official documents such as diplomas and state statutes, and as a practical and legal matter it is usually called '''Kansas State University'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = University Archives Facts and Flyers  | url = http://www.lib.k-state.edu/depts/spec/flyers/ | accessdate = March 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kslegislature.org/li_2014/b2013_14/statute/076_000_0000_chapter/076_004_0000_article/ KS Statutes: Ch 76 Article 4: Kansas State University].

Eisenhower]] served as president of the university from 1943 to 1950, and Dr. James McCain succeeded him, serving from 1950 to 1975. Several buildings, including [[residence hall]]s and a student union, were added to the campus in the 1950s. The 1960s witnessed demonstrations against the [[Vietnam War]], though fewer than at other college campuses. Enrollment was relatively high through most of the 1970s, but the university endured a downward spiral from approximately 1976 to 1986, when enrollment decreased to 17,570 and a number of faculty resigned. In 1986, [[Jon Wefald]] assumed the presidency of Kansas State University. During his tenure, enrollment and donations increased.

=== Oldest public university in Kansas ===
{{See also|History of the University of Kansas}}
The state legislature established the state's [[land-grant college]] in [[Manhattan, Kansas|Manhattan]] on January 13, 1863.&lt;ref name="Frontier" /&gt;  A commission to establish a state university in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] was called for later in the same legislative session, provided that town could meet certain requirements, and finalized later that year.&lt;ref name="1863statutes" /&gt; Kansas State was the first public institution of higher learning founded in the state and began teaching college-level classes in 1863. By comparison, the University of Kansas opened in 1866, but only taught preparatory-level classes until 1869.

Kansas State was founded with an agricultural and scientific college consistent with the land-grant college mandate, as well as departments for military science and literature.&lt;ref name="1863statutes" /&gt; It was formally renamed as ''Kansas State University'' in 1959.&lt;ref name="Cyclopedia" /&gt;

== Campus ==
{{See also|List of oldest buildings on Kansas colleges and universities}}
[[File:PostcardHorticulturalHallManhattanKA1907.jpg|thumb|[[Dickens Hall]], from a 1907 postcard]]
The main campus of Kansas State University in Manhattan now covers {{convert|668|acre|km2}}. The campus is historic, featuring more [[List of oldest buildings on Kansas colleges and universities|buildings built before 1910]] than any other campus in Kansas. Holtz Hall, built in 1876, is the oldest free-standing building on campus.&lt;ref name="Willard" /&gt; However, the oldest building on campus is the original section of Seaton Hall, which now forms Seaton Court, facing the courtyard of [[Hale Library]] and Eisenhower Hall. Originally named the Industrial Workshop, this section of Seaton Hall is the oldest remaining education building on the Manhattan campus.&lt;ref name="Willard" /&gt;

The predominant architectural feature of the Manhattan campus is its use of native [[limestone]]. This includes the signature building at Kansas State University, [[Anderson Hall (Kansas State)|Anderson Hall]], developed in three stages between 1877 and 1885.  Anderson Hall, now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], has housed the university's administrative offices for more than a century. Although there are many historic building on the campus, since 1986 Kansas State has also added over two million square feet (186,000&amp;nbsp;m²) of new buildings to the campus, including an expanded library, new art museum, and plant sciences building.

Several of the buildings on campus were heavily damaged by an EF4 [[tornado]] on [[June 2008 tornado outbreak sequence|June 11, 2008]]. Damage estimates totaled more than $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.kansas.com/weather/2008/06/12/ Wichita Eagle-Beacon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721185651/http://blogs.kansas.com/weather/2008/06/12/ |date=July 21, 2011 }} ''Tornadoes rip Manhattan, KSU damage more than $20 million''&lt;/ref&gt; K-State paid a deductible of $5 million for their insurance to repair all damages.

Since 2014, the Main campus has been under significant renovation to accommodate infrastructure changes. The campus is also adopting a more walking friendly atmosphere by closing off many small access roads to vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kansas State Facilities Site|url=http://www.k-state.edu/facilities/projects/projects/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution petitioned in 1925, and three years later received, a charter of [[Mortar Board]] National College Senior Honor Society.

Kansas State University has 65 academic departments in nine colleges: [[Kansas State University College of Agriculture|Agriculture]]; [[Architecture]], Planning and Design; Arts and Sciences; [[Business Administration]]; [[Education]]; [[Engineering]]; [[Human Ecology]]; [[Technology]] and [[Aviation]]; and [[Veterinary Medicine]].  The graduate school offers 65 master's degree programs and nearly 50 doctoral programs.

In 1991, the former Kansas Technical Institute in [[Salina, Kansas]] was merged with Kansas State University by an act of the [[Kansas]] legislature.  The College of Technology and Aviation is at the Salina campus. Initially, this campus was referred to as Kansas State University – Salina, but on October 14, 2014, the Kansas Board of Regents approved a name change to [[Kansas State University Polytechnic Campus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kansas State University introduces polytechnic campus|url=http://www.k-state.edu/media/newsreleases/oct15/polytechnic101415.html|website=Kansas State University|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

K-State implemented an academic [[honor code]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=  KSU Honor Code| url=http://www.k-state.edu/honor| accessdate =March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When students are admitted, it is implied that they will adhere to the Honor Pledge: "On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work."

=== Agriculture ===
The university has had a long-standing interest in [[agriculture]], particularly native [[Great Plains]] plant and animal life. The [[Kansas State University Gardens]] is an on-campus [[horticulture]] display garden that serves as an educational resource and learning laboratory for K-State students and the public. The [[Konza Prairie]] is a native tallgrass prairie preserve south of Manhattan, which is co-owned by [[The Nature Conservancy]] and Kansas State University and operated as a field research station by the department of biology.  The university also owns an additional {{convert|18000|acre|km2}} in cities across the state that it operates as Agricultural Experiment Stations in research centers in Hays, Garden City, Colby, and Parsons.
[[File:KSU Anderson Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Anderson Hall (Manhattan, Kansas)|Anderson Hall]]]]

In 2006, K-State dedicated the Biosecurity Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.k-state.edu/media/webzine/safetyandsecurity/BRI.html K-State News Services] "K-State's Biosecurity Research Institute to provide research, training space for food safety and security efforts"&lt;/ref&gt; The BRI, in Pat Roberts Hall, is a safe and secure location in which scientists and their collaborators can study high-consequence pathogens. It was designed and constructed for biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) and biosafety level 3 agriculture (BSL-3Ag) research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Biosecurity Research Institute website | url= http://www.bri.k-state.edu/ | format= English | accessdate =June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kansas State University has a long history in biodefense, a history that accelerated in 1999 with the publication of "Homeland Defense Food Safety, Security, and Emergency Preparedness Program." The 100-page document, informally called "The Big Purple Book", outlined the university's research programs in three major infectious disease components: plant pathology, animal health and food processing.

The university maintains numerous facilities, research collaborations and academic programs devoted to agrodefense and biodefense. Notably, the National Agricultural Biosecurity Center (NABC) unites biosecurity researchers with federal, state and local agencies to provide a response to emerging agricultural threats.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.k-state.edu/seek/spring2017/biodefense/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the NBAF decision, leaders at two additional federal facilities announced they are coming to K-State. The Arthropod-Borne Animal Disease Research Unit, or ABADRU, specializes in animal and plant diseases transmitted by insects. The lab relocated from Laramie, Wyo., to K-State in order to fully realize its research mandate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kstatecollegian.com/news/city-officials-announce-relocation-of-federal-lab-1.2048467/ K-State Collegian] "City officials announce relocation of federal lab"&lt;/ref&gt; The Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, or CEEZAD, will research foreign animal, zoonotic and newly discovered pathogens that can have a consequential economic impact on U.S. agriculture, homeland security and human and animal health. It will be led by K-State's Dr. Juergen Richt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= CEEZAD Focuses on Zoonotic Diseases website | url= http://www.k-state.edu/perspectives/documents/Perspectives-Winter_2011.pdf | format= English | accessdate =January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's extensive list of research facilities includes the James R. Macdonald Laboratory for research in atomic, molecular and optical physics and the [[NASA]] Center for Gravitational Studies in Cellular and Developmental Biology.

Kansas State was involved in early experimentation with television and radio broadcasts.  The first radio station licensed in Manhattan was Kansas State's experimental station 9YV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= New Stations: Special Land Stations| work = Radio Service Bulletin | publisher = U.S. Department of Commerce | date= December 1, 1916| page=4| url = https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3221816;view=1up;seq=290 | accessdate = November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 the station began a daily broadcast (in [[morse code]]) of the [[weather forecast]], becoming the first radio station in the U.S. to air a regularly-scheduled forecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Chronology of AM Radio Broadcasting 1900–1960 | url = http://jeff560.tripod.com/chrono1.html | accessdate = February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KKSU"&gt;{{cite web | title = KKSU History | url = http://www.route56.com/radio/mid/kksu.html | accessdate = February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a series of efforts to secure a more high-powered signal for the university – including a brief cooperation with [[John R. Brinkley]]'s notorious KFKB – Kansas State was granted a license for [[KKSU (defunct)|KSAC]], which began broadcasting with 500 watts of power on December 1, 1924.&lt;ref name="KKSU" /&gt; The station was reassigned to the frequency of AM 580 in 1928, and continued broadcasting on that frequency until November 27, 2002, when it made its last broadcast after the frequency was bought out by [[WIBW (AM)|WIBW]] in [[Topeka, Kansas]].&lt;ref name="KKSU" /&gt;

On March 9, 1932, the [[Federal Radio Commission]] granted Kansas State a license to operate the television station W9XAK.&lt;ref name="W9XAK"&gt;{{cite web | title = Early Television Stations: W9XAK – Manhattan, Kansas | publisher = Early Television Museum | url = http://www.earlytelevision.org/w9xak.html | accessdate = February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first television station in [[Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A U.S. Television Chronology: 1875–1970| url = http://claytwhitehead.com/ctwlibrary/Box%20070/003_Timelines%20%5B2%20of%202%5D.pdf | accessdate = February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activity on the station peaked in 1933 and 1934, with original programs being produced three nights a week.  On October 28, 1939, the station broadcast the [[1939 Nebraska vs. Kansas State football game|Homecoming football game]] in Manhattan between [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] and [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]], which was the second college football game ever televised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Televised Game | newspaper = ''Morning Chronicle'' | location = Manhattan, Kansas | date = October 28, 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The station went off the air in 1939.&lt;ref name="W9XAK" /&gt;

''Alma Mater'' is the name of the official school song of Kansas State University. In 1888, when the University was still Kansas State Agricultural College, H.W. Jones submitted the song as part of a school-wide contest. It was originally a four-stanza song and, over the years, some lyrics have changed.&lt;ref name="KS"&gt;[http://www.kstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=400&amp;KEY=&amp;ATCLID=37671 Kansas State Traditions – Kansas State University Wildcats Official Athletics Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822232241/http://www.kstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=400&amp;KEY=&amp;ATCLID=37671 |date=August 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song is sung at most K-State sporting events by fans, students and alumni. [[Wildcat Victory]] and [[Wabash Cannonball]] are both commonly used as fight songs. Wildcat Victory is used by many high schools as their fight song.

Intercollegiate sports began at Kansas State in the 1890s. The school's sports teams are called the Wildcats, and they participate in the [[NCAA Division I]] and the [[Big 12 Conference]]. The [[School colors|official school color]] is [[Shades of purple#KSU Purple|Royal Purple]], making Kansas State one of very few schools (alongside [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditions|url=http://studentactivities.syr.edu/traditions/index.html|publisher=Syracuse University|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201203403/http://studentactivities.syr.edu/traditions/index.html|archivedate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harvard University|Harvard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Harvard University |url=http://www.harvard.edu/history|work=Harvard at a Glance|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that have only one official color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kansas State Traditions |url=http://www.kstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=400&amp;KEY=&amp;ATCLID=37671 |format=English |accessdate=November 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226195617/http://www.kstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=400&amp;KEY=&amp;ATCLID=37671 |archivedate=December 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; White and silver are commonly used as complementary colors; white is mentioned with purple in the university's fight song "Wildcat Victory." The athletics logo is a stylized Wildcat head in profile usually featured in the school color, called the "Powercat."

Sports sponsored by the school include [[American football|football]], [[basketball]], [[cross country running|cross country]] and [[track and field|track]], [[baseball]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], women's soccer, and [[volleyball]]. The head football coach is [[Bill Snyder]], the head men's basketball coach is [[Bruce Weber (basketball)|Bruce Weber]], the head women's basketball coach is [[Jeff Mittie]], and the head baseball coach is [[Brad Hill (baseball)|Brad Hill]]. In 2012−2013, Kansas State became only the second Big 12 school to win conference titles in football, men's basketball, and baseball in the same school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Is K-State nation's hottest school? | agency = Associated Press | date = March 12, 2013 | url = http://msn.foxsports.com/collegebasketball/story/kansas-state-big-12-football-basketball-champions-nations-hottest-program-looking-to-cap-magical-season-031213 | accessdate = March 13, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130315101520/http://msn.foxsports.com/collegebasketball/story/kansas-state-big-12-football-basketball-champions-nations-hottest-program-looking-to-cap-magical-season-031213 | archivedate = March 15, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, [[African-American]] athletes at Kansas State were responsible for breaking the modern "color barrier" in [[Big Seven Conference]] athletics. Harold Robinson became the first African-American athlete in the conference in more than two decades and the first ever to receive a scholarship, playing football for Kansas State in 1949.  In the spring of 1951 the conference's baseball color barrier was broken by Kansas State's [[Earl Woods]], and in the winter of 1951–1952 Kansas State's Gene Wilson broke the conference color barrier in basketball (together with [[LaVannes C. Squires]] at the [[University of Kansas]]).

The 46th [[Governor of Kansas]], now serving as [[United States Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom|Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom]] under President Donald Trump, [[Sam Brownback]], and one [[United States Congressional Delegations from Kansas|U.S. Senator from Kansas]], [[Pat Roberts]], are graduates of Kansas State University. Other graduates currently serve as the vice-president of [[Liberia]], the [[University president|president]] of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], and the [[University president|president]] of the [[University of the Virgin Islands]].  Kansas State alums have been enshrined in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[College Football Hall of Fame]], served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and have earned [[Emmy Award]]s and [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medals. [[Geraldine L. Richmond]], the [[National Medal of Science]] laureate (2013) and [[Priestley Medal]]ist (2018), received a B.S. in chemistry in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geraldine Richmond named 2018 Priestley Medalist|url=https://cen.acs.org/articles/95/i24/Geraldine-Richmond-named-2018-Priestley-Medalist.html|website=cen.acs.org|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faculty ===
In line with its roots as a land grant college, a number of Kansas State's most eminent [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] in its earliest years were in the areas of agriculture, science and military.  For example, famed geologist [[Benjamin Franklin Mudge]] was chair of the geology department, while famed Army officer [[Andrew Summers Rowan]], the subject of the essay ''[[A Message to Garcia]]'', served as professor of military tactics.

Kansas State faculty have received a number of awards.  Prof. [[Fred Albert Shannon]] was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for History]] in 1929, while teaching history at Kansas State. In 2008, [[Council for Advancement and Support of Education|CASE]] and the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] honored [[Michael Wesch]] as national Professor of the Year.  At least eight Kansas State faculty members have gone on to serve as university presidents, including [[Naomi B. Lynn]], the first Hispanic female president of an American public university.

Minority (non-[[Japanese people|Japanese]]) students can be found throughout the entire Japanese education system. An incomplete list of possible cultural and or [[language minorities]] represented in Japanese schools include:
*other Asians, particularly [[Koreans in Japan|Koreans]], [[Chinese people in Japan|Chinese]], [[Filipinos in Japan|Filipinos]], [[Nepalis in Japan|Nepalis]], [[Thai people|Thais]], [[Mongolians in Japan|Mongolians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Japan|Vietnamese]]
*Europeans
*North Americans
*[[Latin America]]n, particularly [[Brazilians in Japan|Brazilian]] and [[Peru]]vian
*[[Kikokushijo|Returnee children]]
*[[bicultural]] children whose parents are from separate cultures and/or who speak separate languages
*[[Ryukyuan people]]
*[[Ainu people]]

[[Okinawa]]ns and [[Ainu people|Ainu]] are considered to be speakers of [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and as a result are not considered language minorities. Descendants of Koreans and Chinese who have lived in Japan for many generations also speak Japanese as their [[first language]]. However, other non-Japanese-speaking children, such as the children of [[Japanese orphans in China|Japanese World War II orphans raised in China]], who have been returning to Japan in the past decades, have introduced an element of language minorities to schools in Japan since the late 1970s.

==Policy==
===Obligations===
The [[International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]] from the 69th plenary meeting of the [[United Nations]] in 1990 states the following:
*State of employment shall pursue a policy ... aimed at facilitating the integration of children of migrant workers in the local school system, particularly in respect of teaching them the local language.
*States of employment shall endeavor to facilitate for the children of migrant workers the teaching of their [[mother tongue]] and culture.
*States of employment may provide special schemes of education in the mother tongue of children of migrant workers.

===Reality===
Despite the presence of large numbers of non-Japanese or non-Japanese speaking students in the Japanese school system, the education system is designed to teach all students equally, despite their abilities, in what is known as the ''[[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]ist'' model.

[[Education in Japan]] is compulsory for Japanese students up through the ninth grade. All children of Japanese parents automatically receive notification when they are about to begin school. However, for children of foreigners living in Japan, only those children whose parents have informed the local town office that they want their children to be enrolled in school receive a notification. As a result, the onus for educating language minorities in Japan falls on the local school or school board and not the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT).

A 1996 MEXT study group decided: "there is no need for [language minorities'] native language education" (Vaipae, p.&amp;nbsp;199 in Noguchi and Santos).

==Students==
===Numbers===
Noguchi (in Noguchi and Fotos) wrote that the number of language minority students in Japanese schools ''surpassed 17,000 in 1998'' (p.&amp;nbsp;15). Of these students, the majority speak Portuguese, Chinese, Spanish, Tagalog, Korean, Vietnamese or English (in descending order). According to a MEXT survey that Vaipae studied, another 39 other languages are represented in Japanese public schools (p.&amp;nbsp;187). Most of these students are concentrated in industrial centers and urban areas, however, all prefectures had language minority students. [[Akita prefecture|Akita]] had the lowest number of these students, while [[Gunma prefecture|Gunma]] had the highest concentration.

===Needs===
The language needs of these children vary from student to student, and is dependent on a number of factors, including: length of stay in Japan; contact with Japanese prior to, during and after school; their parents own ideas about the Japanese language and Japanese schooling; and services available to them in their [[first language]] (L1) and in Japanese - the [[second language]] (L2) - at their schools.

Cummins and Swain (1986) argued that by not allowing for L1 support in the L2 environment of a minority-language-student will significantly affect the student's linguistic, cognitive, social and psychological development.

In the Cummins &amp; Swain model, [[bilingualism]] within each bilingual child must be seen as complementary languages. Providing support to the L1 will allow for cognitive transfer to the L2. (In [[language immersion|immersion]] programs, the opposite has also been shown: as those majority-language students are together learning in their L2, the L1 also improves significantly.)

Yet, for minority language students in an L2 classroom situation, learning in an L2 does not imply that knowledge transfer will occur. It is possible that instead of having bilinguals or monolinguals, schools could produce half-linguals - half-literate in one or two languages. Early research by Cummins (1979) has shown that an ability to use the L2 in the playground does NOT imply that the student has the academic language to perform in the classroom. A distinction between [[Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills]] (BICS) and [[Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency]] (CALP) needs to be made therefore by educators and administrators to assist minority language students in the classroom.

Furthermore, Japanese children learn a writing system that involves both phonetic [[syllabary|syllabaries]] ([[hiragana]] and [[katakana]]) and a pictographic writing system ([[kanji]]). Minority students who enter Japanese schools are starting with a large deficit in reading skills. The student must catch up and then keep up without the prerequisite knowledge-base of the spoken language.

Cook (1999) writes: ''[t]he moral for teaching is to make the L2 non-threatening and to allow the learner to persevere long enough to feel the benefits.''. Yet, Cummins (cited in Fujita, p.&amp;nbsp;17) writes: ''[s]chools reflect the societal power structure by eradicating minority students’ language and identity and then attributing their school failure to inherent deficiencies''.

===Goals===
Fujita (2002) argues there is no goal to maintain the L2 in ''returnee'' children because Japan as yet has no clear "consensus as to the purpose of learning English in Japan [...] Returnees were once thought to be able to trigger a change in monolithic Japanese educational system by introducing diversity however it seems that this has not happened" (Fujita, p.&amp;nbsp;19).

Since there is no goal for maintaining either the L2 of returnee children nor the L1 of minority language students, with the exceptions of a few schools, immersion (or bilingualism) is not a Japanese educational reality. However, for the majority of minority language students in Japan, ''submersion'' is more appropriate (see [[Language immersion]] for more information on submersion in the classroom).

With much linguistic support from society, school, and the family, returnee children are able to at least make the transition to the [[First language|L1]] (Japanese) channel, with various shades of ease and difficulty. For non-Japanese students, the situation is much different.

===Consequences===
Noguchi and Fotos (2001) studied bilingualism and bilingual education in Japan in which many authors commented that schools reflect the [[First language]] (L1) culture and in doing so have a tendency to minimise minority language students' home language, culture and identity. Decisions to ignore the home culture and language of minority students, or of the [[Second language]] (L2) of returnee children, create a number of problems within the language minority student related to self, including [[cognitive development]] and [[language proficiency]]. (See also Richard, 2001.)

Vaipae discusses an American junior high school student who is without any language support from his school. The student was a bilingual (Spanish and English) and biliterate eighth grader when he arrived in Japan. Unfortunately, the school provided no Japanese as a second language instruction. She writes: ''[i]ronically, he received a failing grade in English because he could not read the Japanese instructions on the term test. Although his parents had requested that the readings of the Chinese characters be provided in the easily-mastered [[hiragana]] syllabary, the [Japanese] English teacher refused to provide this linguistic support, pointing out that it would be unfair to other students if the tests were not identical.''

Another struggling minority student in Japan, a Peruvian sixth-grader, tells Vaipae: ''[i]n my country I had a good life... everything goes as I like, for instance, soccer, volleyball, swimming, running, talking and studying. I was really good at these things and I also had many friends. Now I am good at nothing.''

Hirataka, Koishi, &amp; Kato (in Noguchi and Fotos) studied the children of Brazilian workers in and around [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa|Fujisawa]] in [[Kanagawa prefecture|Kanagawa]] where they lived with their laborer parents. The parents of the children from the study speak L1-[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and have little to no Japanese language ability. The schools that the subjects attend provide very little L1 language support. Portuguese remains the L1 at home, but the students' productive abilities in Portuguese has [[Language attrition|attrited]] in varying degrees depending on among other things, age of arrival in Japan and parental support. Japanese is the language of the school and the surrounding community. As a result, children are shifting from Portuguese to Japanese. Communication between parent and child is increasingly difficult.

Cummins &amp; Swain write: ''there may be threshold levels of linguistic competence which a bilingual child must attain both in order to avoid cognitive disadvantages and to allow the potentially beneficial aspects of becoming bilingual to influence his cognitive functioning'' (p.&amp;nbsp;18).

Richard (2001) argued that as Japan welcomes unskilled laborers for the menial 3K jobs: kitsui, kitanai and kikenna—in English, [[Dirty, Dangerous and Demeaning]]—not to mention the thousands of foreign female sex workers, that Japan also has a legal and moral obligation to welcome those workers’ children.

'''Magnus Hirschfeld''' (14 May 1868 – 14 May 1935) was a [[Germans|German]] [[Jewish]] physician and [[sexologist]] educated primarily in Germany; he based his practice in [[Berlin-Charlottenburg]]. An outspoken advocate for [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]], Hirschfeld founded the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]]. Historian Dustin Goltz characterized this group as having carried out "the first advocacy for [[LGBT social movements|homosexual and transgender rights]]".&lt;ref name="goltz2008"&gt;Goltz, Dustin (2008). "Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Movements", In Lind, Amy; Brzuzy, Stephanie (eds.). ''Battleground: Women, Gender, and Sexuality: Volume 2'', pp. 291 ff. Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-313-34039-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hirschfeld was born in [[Kolberg]] (now [[Kołobrzeg]], Poland), in an Ashkenazi [[Jewish]] family, the son of a highly regarded physician and Senior Medical Officer Hermann Hirschfeld. In 1887–1888, he studied [[philosophy]] and [[philology]] in [[Breslau]], then from 1888 to 1892 [[medicine]] in [[Strasbourg]], [[Munich]], [[Heidelberg]], and [[Berlin]]. In 1892, he earned his doctoral degree.

After his studies, he traveled through the United States for eight months, visiting the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]], and living from the proceeds of his writing for German journals. During his time in Chicago, Hirschfeld became involved with the homosexual sub-culture in that city.{{sfn|Bauer|2007|p=21}} Struck by the essential similarities between the homosexual sub-cultures of Chicago and Berlin, Hirschfeld first developed his theory about the universality of homosexuality across the world, as he researched in books and newspaper articles about the existence of gay sub-cultures in Rio de Janeiro, Tangier, and Tokyo.{{sfn|Bauer|2007|p=21}} Then he started a [[Naturopathic medicine|naturopathic]] practice in [[Magdeburg]]; in 1896, he moved his practice to [[Charlottenburg|Berlin-Charlottenburg]].

Hirschfeld first became interested in gay rights when he noticed that many of his gay patients were committing suicide.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=37}} In the German language, the word for suicide is ''Selbstmord'' ("self-murder"), which carried more judgemental and condemnatory connotations than its English language equivalent, making the subject of suicide a taboo in 19th century Germany.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=40}}

In particular, Hirschfeld mentioned as a reason for his gay rights activism, the story of one of his patients: a young Army officer suffering from depression, who killed himself in 1896, leaving behind a suicide note saying, despite his best efforts, he could not end his desires for other men, and so had ended his life out of his guilt and shame.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=39}} In his suicide note, the officer wrote that he lacked the "strength" to tell his parents the "truth", and spoke of his shame of "that which nearly strangled my heart". The officer could not even bring himself to use the word "homosexuality", which was instead conspicuously referred to as "that" in his note.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=40}} However, the officer mentioned at the end of his suicide note: "The thought that you [Hirschfeld] could contribute a future when the German fatherland will think of ''us'' in more just terms sweetens the hour of my death".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=41}} Hirschfeld had been treating the officer for depression in 1895–96, and the use of the term "us" led to speculation that a relationship existed between the two. However, the officer's use of ''Sie'', the formal German word for you, instead of the informal ''Du'', suggests Hirschfeld's relationship with his patient was strictly professional.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=41}}

At the same time, Hirschfeld was greatly affected by the trial of [[Oscar Wilde]], which he often referred to in his writings.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=55}} Hirschfeld was struck by the number of his gay patients who had ''Suizidialnarben'' ("scars left by suicide attempts"), and often found himself trying to give his patients a reason to live.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=48}}

==Sexual rights activism==
===Scientific-Humanitarian Committee===
Magnus Hirschfeld found a balance between practicing medicine and writing about his findings. Between 1 May-15 October 1896, the ''Grosse Berliner Gewerbeausstellung'' ("Great Industrial Exhibition of Berlin) took place, which featured 9 "human zoos" where people from Germany's colonies in New Guinea and Africa were put on display for the visitors to gawk at.{{sfn|Bauer|2007|p=22}} Such exhibitions of colonial peoples were common at industrial fairs, and later after Qingdao, the Mariannas and Caroline islands became part of the German empire, Chinese, Chamorros and Micronesians all joined the Africans and New Guineans displayed in the "human zoos". Hirschfeld, who was keenly interested in sexuality in other cultures, visited the ''Grosse Berliner Gewerbeastellung'' and subsequently other exhibitions to inquire of the people in the "human zoos" via interpreters about the status of sexuality in their cultures.{{sfn|Bauer|2007|p=22-23}} It was in 1896, after talking to the people displayed in the "human zoos" at the ''Grosse Berliner Gewerbeastellung'', that Hirschfeld began writing what became his 1914 book ''Die Homosexualität des Mannes und des Weibes'' ("The Homosexuality of Men &amp; Women"), an attempt to comprehensively survey homosexuality around the globe, as part of an effort to prove that homosexuality occurred in every culture.{{sfn|Bauer|2007|p=23}}

After several years as a general practitioner in Magdeburg, in 1896 he issued a pamphlet, ''[[Sappho]] and [[Socrates]]'', on homosexual love (under the pseudonym Th. Ramien). In 1897, Hirschfeld founded the [[Scientific Humanitarian Committee]] with the publisher [[Max Spohr]], the lawyer Eduard Oberg, and the writer Franz Joseph von Bülow. The group aimed to undertake research to defend the rights of [[homosexual]]s and to repeal [[Paragraph 175]], the section of the German penal code that, since 1871, had criminalized homosexuality. They argued that the law encouraged [[blackmail]]. The motto of the Committee, "Justice through science", reflected Hirschfeld's belief that a better scientific understanding of homosexuality would eliminate social [[homophobia|hostility toward homosexuals]].

Within the group, some of the members rejected Hirschfeld's (and [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs|Ulrichs]]'s) view that male homosexuals are, by nature, effeminate. [[Benedict Friedlaender]] and some others left the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee and formed another group, the "Bund für männliche Kultur" or Union for Male Culture, which did not exist long. It argued that male-male love is an aspect of virile manliness, rather than a special condition.

Under Hirschfeld's leadership, the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee gathered over 5000 signatures from prominent Germans on a petition to overturn Paragraph 175. Signatories included [[Albert Einstein]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Käthe Kollwitz]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Heinrich Mann]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[August Bebel]], [[Max Brod]], [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] and [[Eduard Bernstein]].

The bill was brought before the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] in 1898, but was supported only by a minority from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. [[August Bebel]], a friend of Hirschfeld from his university days, agreed to sponsor the attempt to repeal Paragraph 175.{{sfn|Bauer|2007|p=25}} Hirschfeld considered what would, in a later era, be described as "[[outing]]": forcing out of [[the closet]] some of the prominent and secretly homosexual lawmakers who had remained silent on the bill. He arranged for the bill to be reintroduced and, in the 1920s, it made some progress until the takeover of the [[Nazi Party]] ended all hopes for any such reform.

As part of his efforts to counter popular prejudice, Hirschfeld spoke out about the taboo subject of suicide and was the first to present statistical evidence that homosexuals were more likely to commit suicide or attempt suicide than heterosexuals.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=49}} Hirschfeld prepared questionnaires that gay men could answer anonymously about homosexuality and suicide. Collating his results, Hirschfeld estimated that 3 out of every 100 gays committed suicide every year, that a quarter of gays had attempted suicide at some point in their lives and that the other three-quarters had had suicidal thoughts at some point. He used his evidence to argue that, under current social conditions in Germany, life was literally unbearable for homosexuals.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=49}}

A figure frequently mentioned by Hirschfeld to illustrate the "hell experienced by homosexuals" was [[Oscar Wilde]], who was a well known author in Germany, and whose trials in 1895 had been extensively covered by the German press.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=54}} Hirschfeld visited Cambridge University in 1905 to meet Wilde's son, [[Vyvyan Holland]], and was struck by how his son had changed his surname to avoid being associated with his father.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=54}} Hirschfeld noted "the name Wilde" has, since his trial, sounded like "an indecent word, which causes homosexuals to blush with shame, women to avert their eyes, and normal men to be outraged".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=54}} During his visit to Britain, Hirschfeld was invited to a secret ceremony in the English countryside where a "group of beautiful, young, male students" from Cambridge gathered together wearing Wilde's prison number, C33, as a way of symbolically linking his fate to theirs, to read out aloud Wilde's poem ''[[The Ballad of Reading Gaol]]''.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=55}} Hirschfeld found the reading of ''The Ballad of Reading Gaol'' to be "''markerschütternd''"  (shaken to the core of one's being, i.e. something that is emotionally devastating), going on to write that the poem reading was "the most earth-shattering outcry that has ever been voiced by a downtrodden soul about its own torture and that of humanity".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=55}} By the end of the reading of ''The Ballad of Reading Gaol'', Hirshfeld felt "quiet joy" as he was convinced that, despite the way that Wilde's life had been ruined, something good would eventually come of it.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=55}}

In 1905, Hirschfeld joined the ''Bund für Mutterschutz'' (League for the Protection of Mothers), the [[feminist]] organization founded by [[Helene Stöcker]].{{sfn|Bauer|2007|p=80}} He campaigned for the decriminalisation of [[abortion]], and against policies that banned female teachers and civil servants from marrying or having children.{{elucidate|date=August 2010}} Both Hirschfeld and Stöcker believed that there was a close connection between the causes of gay rights and women's rights, and Stöcker was much involved in the campaign to repeal Paragraph 175 while Hirschfeld campaigned for the repeal of Paragraph 218, which had banned abortion.{{sfn|Bauer|2007|p=80}}

In 1906, Hirschfeld was asked as a doctor to examine a prisoner in Neumünster to see if he was suffering from "severe nervous disturbances caused by a combination of malaria, blackwater fever and congenital sexual anomaly".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=28}} The man, a former soldier and a veteran of what Hirschfeld called the "''Hereroaufstand''" ("Herero revolt") in [[German Southwest Africa]] (modern [[Namibia]]) appeared to be suffering from what would now be considered post-traumatic stress disorder, saying that he had done terrible things in Southwest Africa, and could no longer live with himself.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=28}} In 1904, the Herero and Namaqua peoples who had been steadily pushed off their land to make way for German settlers, had revolted, causing Kaiser Wilhelm II to dispatch General [[Lothar von Trotha]] to wage a "war of annihilation" to exterminate the Herero and Namaqua in what has since become known as the [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|Herero genocide]].{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=28}} The genocide came to widespread attention when the SPD leader [[August Bebel]] criticized the government on the floor of the ''Reichstag'', saying the government did not have the right to exterminate the Herero just because they were black. Hirschfeld did not mention his diagnosis of the prisoner, nor he did mention in detail the source of the prisoner's guilt about his actions in Southwest Africa; the German scholar Heike Bauer criticized him for his seeming unwillingness to see the connection between the Herero genocide and the prisoner's guilt, which had caused him to engage in a petty crime wave.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=28-29}}

Hirschfeld's position, that homosexuality was normal and natural, made him a highly controversial figure at the time, involving him in vigorous debates with other academics, who regarded homosexuality as unnatural and wrong.{{sfn|Dickinson|2002|p=272}} One of Hirschfeld's leading critics was Austrian Baron [[Christian von Ehrenfels]], who advocated radical changes to society and sexuality to combat the supposed "Yellow Peril", and saw Hirshfeld's theories as a challenge to his view of sexuality.{{sfn|Dickinson|2002|p=272}} Ehrenfels argued that there were a few "biologically degenerate" homosexuals who lured otherwise "healthy boys" into their lifestyle, making homosexuality into a choice and a wrong one at that time.{{sfn|Dickinson|2002|p=272}}

At same time, Hirschfeld became involved in a debate with a number of anthropologists about the supposed existence of ''Hottentottenschürze'' ("Hottentot apron"), namely the belief that the [[Khoikhoi]] (known to Westerners as Hottentots) women of southern Africa had abnormally enlarged labia, which made them inclined towards lesbianism.{{sfn|Bauer|2007|p=30}} Hirschfeld argued there was no evidence that the Khoikhoi women had abnormally large labia, whose supposed existence had fascinated so many Western anthropologists at the time, and that, other than being black, the bodies of Khoikhoi women were no different from German women.{{sfn|Bauer|2007|p=30}} One Khoikoi woman, [[Sarah Baartman]], the "Hottentot Venus", did have relatively large buttocks and labia, compared to Northern European women, and had been exhibited at a freak show in Europe in the early 19th century, which was the origin of this belief about the Khoikhoi women. Hirschfeld wrote: "The differences appear minimal compared to what is shared" between Khoikhoi and German women.{{sfn|Bauer|2007|p=30}} Turning the argument of the anthropologists on their head, Hirschfeld argued that, if same-sex relationships were common among Khoikhoi women, and if the bodies of Khoikhoi women were essentially the same as Western women, then Western women must have the same tendencies. Hirschfeld's theories about a spectrum of sexuality existing in all of the world's cultures implicitly undercut the binary theories about the differences between various races that was the basis of the claim of white supremacy.{{sfn|Bauer|2007|p=30}} However,  Bauer wrote that Hirschfeld's theories about the universality of homosexuality paid little attention to cultural contexts, and criticized him for his remarks that Hausa women in Nigeria were well known for their lesbian tendencies and would have been executed for their sapphic acts before British rule, as assuming that imperialism was always good for the colonized.{{sfn|Bauer|2007|p=30-31}}

===Eulenburg affair===
Hirschfeld played a prominent role in the [[Harden–Eulenburg affair]] of 1906–09, which became the most widely publicized sex scandal in Imperial Germany. During the libel trial in 1907, when General [[Kuno von Moltke]] sued the journalist [[Maximilian Harden]], after the latter had run an article accusing Moltke of having a homosexual relationship with the politically powerful Prince [[Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg|Philipp von Eulenburg]], who was the Kaiser's best friend, Hirschfeld testified for Harden. In his role as an expert witness, Hirschfeld testified that Moltke was gay and, thus, what Harden had written was true.&lt;ref name="Mancini, Elena page 100"&gt;Mancini, Elena ''Magnus Hirschfeld and the Quest for Sexual Freedom: A History of the First International Sexual Freedom Movement'', London: Macmillan, 2010 page 100&lt;/ref&gt; Hirschfeld — who wanted to make homosexuality legal in Germany — believed that proving Army officers like Moltke were gay would help his case for legalization. He also testified that he believed there was nothing wrong with Moltke.&lt;ref name="Mancini, Elena page 100"/&gt;

Most notably, Hirschfeld testified that "homosexuality was part of the plan of nature and creation just like normal love."&lt;ref&gt;Domeier, Norman ''The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire'', Rochester: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2015 page 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Hirschfeld's testimony caused outrage all over Germany. The ''Vossische Zeitung'' newspaper condemned Hirschfeld in an editorial as "a freak who acted for freaks in the name of pseudoscience".&lt;ref name="Mancini, Elena page 100"/&gt; The ''Mūnchener Neuesten Nachrichten'' newspaper declared in an editorial: "Dr. Hirschfeld makes public propaganda under the cover of science, which does nothing but poison our people. Real science should fight against this!".&lt;ref name="Mancini, Elena page 100"/&gt; A notable witness at the trial was Lilly von Elbe, former wife of Moltke, who testified that her husband had only made love to her twice in their entire marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Domeier, Norman ''The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire'', Rochester: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2015 page 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Elbe spoke with remarkable openness for the period of her sexual desires and her frustration with a husband who was only interested in having sex with Eulenburg.&lt;ref name="Domeier, Norman pages 103-104"&gt;Domeier, Norman ''The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire'', Rochester: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2015 pages 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; Elbe's testimony was marked by moments of low comedy when it emerged that she had taken to attacking Moltke with a frying pan in vain attempts to make him have sex with her.&lt;ref&gt;Domeier, Norman ''The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire'', Rochester: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2015 page 104&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that General von Moltke was unable to defend himself from his wife's attacks was taken as proof that he was deficient in his masculinity, which many saw as confirming his homosexuality. At the time, the subject of female sexuality was taboo, and Elbe's testimony was very controversial, with many saying that Elbe must, in some way, be mentally ill because of her willingness to acknowledge her sexuality.&lt;ref name="Domeier, Norman pages 103-105"&gt;Domeier, Norman ''The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire'', Rochester: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2015 pages 103–105.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, it was generally believed that women should be "chaste" and "pure", and not have any sort of sexuality at all. Letters to the newspapers at the time, from both men and women, overwhelmingly condemned Elbe for her "disgusting" testimony concerning her sexuality.&lt;ref name="Domeier, Norman pages 103-105"/&gt; As an expert witness, Hirschfeld also testified that female sexuality was natural, and Elbe was just a normal woman who was, in no way, mentally ill.&lt;ref name="Mancini, Elena page 100"/&gt; After the jury ruled in favor of Harden, Judge Hugo Isenbiel was enraged by the jury's decision, which he saw as expressing approval for Hirschfeld. He overturned the verdict under the grounds that homosexuals "have the morals of dogs" and insisted that this verdict could not be allowed to stand.&lt;ref name="Mancini, Elena page 100"/&gt;

After the verdict was overturned, a second trial found Harden guilty of libel.&lt;ref name="Mancini, Elena page 100"/&gt; At the second trial, Hirschfeld again testified as an expert witness, but this time, he was much less certain than he had been at the first trial about Moltke's homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Mancini, Elena page 101"&gt;Mancini, Elena ''Magnus Hirschfeld and the Quest for Sexual Freedom: A History of the First International Sexual Freedom Movement'', London: Macmillan, 2010 page 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Hirschfeld testified that Moltke and Eulenburg had an "intimate" friendship that was homoerotic in nature but not sexual, as he had testified at the first trial.&lt;ref&gt;Mancini, Elena ''Magnus Hirschfeld and the Quest for Sexual Freedom: A History of the First International Sexual Freedom Movement'', London: Macmillan, 2010  page 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Hirschfeld also testified that, though he still believed female sexuality was normal, Elbe was suffering from hysteria caused by a lack of sex, and so the court should discount her stories about a sexual relationship between Moltke and Eulenburg.&lt;ref name="Mancini, Elena page 101"/&gt; Hirschfeld had been threatened by the Prussian government with having his medical license revoked if he testified as an expert witness again along the same lines that he had at the first trial, and possibly prosecuted for violating Paragraph 175.&lt;ref name="Mancini, Elena page 101"/&gt; The trial was a libel suit against Harden by Moltke, but much of the testimony had concerned Eulenburg, whose status as the best friend of Wilhelm II meant that the scandal was threatening to involve the Kaiser.&lt;ref name="Mancini, Elena page 101"/&gt; Moreover, far from precipitating increased tolerance as Hirschfeld had expected, the scandal led to a major homophobic and anti-Semitic backlash, and Hirschfeld's biographer Elena Mancini speculated that Hirschfeld wanted to bring to an end an affair that was hindering rather helping the cause for gay rights.&lt;ref name="Mancini, Elena page 101"/&gt; 
 
Because Eulenburg was a prominent anti-Semite and Hirschfeld was a Jew, during the affair, the ''völkisch'' movement came out in support of Eulenburg, whom they portrayed as an Aryan heterosexual, framed by false allegations of homosexuality by Hirschfeld and Harden.&lt;ref name="Domeier, Norman page 169"&gt;Domeier, Norman ''The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire'', Rochester: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2015 page 169&lt;/ref&gt; Various ''völkisch'' leaders, most notably the radical anti-Semitic journalist [[Theodor Fritsch]], used the Eulenburg affair as a chance to "settle the accounts" with the Jews. As a gay Jew, Hirschfeld was vilified relentlessly by the ''völkisch'' newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Domeier, Norman ''The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire'', Rochester: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2015 pages 169–170&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Hirschfeld's house in Berlin, posters were affixed by ''völkisch'' activists, which read "Dr. Hirschfeld A Public Danger: The Jews are Our Undoing!".&lt;ref&gt;Mancini, Elena ''Magnus Hirschfeld and the Quest for Sexual Freedom: A History of the First International Sexual Freedom Movement'', London: Macmillan, 2010 page 101&lt;/ref&gt; In Nazi Germany, the official interpretation of the Eulenburg affair was that Eulenburg was a straight Aryan whose career was destroyed by false claims of being gay by Jews like Hirschfeld.&lt;ref name="Domeier, Norman page 169"/&gt; After the scandal had ended, Hirschfeld concluded that, far from helping the gay rights movement as he had hoped, the ensuing backlash set the movement back.&lt;ref&gt;Domeier, Norman ''The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire'', Rochester: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2015 page 139&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion drawn by the German government was the opposite of the one that Hirschfeld wanted; the fact that prominent men like General von Moltke and Eulenburg were gay did not lead the government to repeal Paragraph 175 as Hirschfeld had hoped and, instead, the government decided that Paragraph 175 was being enforced with insufficient vigor, leading to a crackdown on homosexuals that was unprecedented and would not be exceeded until the Nazi era.&lt;ref name="Domeier, Norman pages 103-104"/&gt;

===World War I===
In 1914, Hirschfeld was swept up by the national enthusiasm for the ''Burgfrieden'' ("Peace within a castle under siege") as the sense of national solidarity was known where almost all Germans rallied to the Fatherland.&lt;ref&gt;Mancini, Elena ''Magnus Hirschfeld and the Quest for Sexual Freedom: A History of the First International Sexual Freedom Movement'', London: Macmillan, 2010 page 111&lt;/ref&gt; Initially pro-war, Hirschfeld started to turn against the war in 1915, moving towards a pacifist position.&lt;ref name="Mancini, Elena page 112"&gt;Mancini, Elena ''Magnus Hirschfeld and the Quest for Sexual Freedom: A History of the First International Sexual Freedom Movement'', London: Macmillan, 2010 page 112&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1915 pamphlet, ''Warum Hassen uns die Völker?'' ("Why do other nations hate us?"), Hirschfeld answered his own question by arguing that it was the greatness of Germany that excited envy from other nations, especially Great Britain, and so had supposedly caused them to come together to destroy the ''Reich''.{{sfn|Baurer|2017|p=31-32}} Hirschfeld accused Britain of starting the war in 1914 "out of envy at the development and size of the German Empire".{{sfn|Baurer|2017|p=32}} ''Warum Hassen uns die Völker?'' was characterized by a chauvinist and ultra-nationalist tone, together with a rather crass Anglophobia that has often embarrassed Hirschfeld's admirers today such as [[Charlotte Wolff]] who called the pamphlet a "perversion of the values which Hirschfeld had always stood for".{{sfn|Baurer|2017|p=32}}

As a Jewish homosexual, Hirschfeld was acutely aware that many Germans did not consider him to be a 'proper' German, or even a German at all; so, he reasoned that, taking an ultra-patriotic stance might break down prejudices by showing that German Jews and/or homosexuals could also be good, patriotic Germans, rallying to the cry of the Fatherland.{{sfn|Baurer|2017|p=33}} By 1916, Hirschfeld was writing pacifist pamphlets, calling for an immediate end to the war.&lt;ref name="Mancini, Elena page 112"/&gt; In his 1916 pamphlet ''Kriegspsychologisches'' ("The Psychology of War"), Hirschfeld was far more critical of the war than he had been in 1915, emphasizing the suffering and trauma caused by it. He also expressed the opinion that nobody wanted to take responsibility for the war because its horrors were "superhuman in size".{{sfn|Baurer|2017|p=34}} He declared that "it is not enough that the war ends with peace; it must end with reconciliation".{{sfn|Baurer|2017|p=34}} In late 1918, Hirschfeld together with his sister, Franziska Mann, co-wrote a pamphlet ''Was jede Frau vom Wahlrecht wissen muß!''" ("What every woman needs to know about the right to vote!") hailing the November Revolution for granting German women the right to vote and announced the "eyes of the world are now resting on German women".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=80}}

===Interwar period===
In 1920, Hirschfeld was very badly beaten up by a group of ''völkisch'' activists who attacked him on the street; he was initially declared dead when the police arrived.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=97}} In 1921, Hirschfeld organised the First Congress for Sexual Reform, which led to the formation of the [[World League for Sexual Reform]]. Congresses were held in [[Copenhagen]] (1928), [[London]] (1929), [[Vienna]] (1930), and [[Brno]] (1932).

[[File:KoenerAndHirschfeld.png|thumb|right|[[Conrad Veidt]] and Hirschfeld as Paul Körner and the Doctor in ''[[Different from the Others]]'']]

Hirschfeld was both quoted and caricatured in the press as a vociferous expert on sexual matters; during his 1931 tour of the United States, the Hearst newspaper chain dubbed him "the Einstein of Sex". He identified as a campaigner and a scientist, investigating and cataloging many varieties of sexuality, not just homosexuality. He developed a system which categorised 64 possible types of sexual intermediary, ranging from masculine, heterosexual male to feminine, homosexual male, including those he described under the term [[transvestite]] (Ger. ''Transvestit''), which he coined in 1910 to describe people who, in the 21st century, might be referred to as [[transgender]] or [[transsexual]].

===''Anders als die Andern''===
Hirschfeld co-wrote and acted in the 1919 film ''[[Anders als die Andern]]'' ("Different From the Others"), in which [[Conrad Veidt]] played one of the first homosexual characters ever written for cinema. The film had a specific [[gay rights]] law reform agenda; after Veidt's character is [[blackmail]]ed by a male prostitute, he eventually [[coming out|comes out]] rather than continuing to make the blackmail payments. His career is destroyed and he is driven to [[suicide]].

Hirschfeld played himself in ''Anders als die Andern'', where the title cards has him say: "The persecution of homosexuals belongs to the same sad chapter of history in which the persecutions of witches and heretics is inscribed...Only with the French Revolution did a complete change come about. Everywhere where the Code Napoleon was introduced, the laws against homosexuals were repealed, for they were considered a violation of the rights of the individual...In Germany, however, despite more than fifty years of scientific research, legal discrimination against homosexuals continues unabated...May justice soon prevail over injustice in this area, science conquer superstition, love achieve victory over hatred!"{{sfn|Steakley|1999|p=183}}

In May 1919, when the film premiered in Berlin, the First World War was still a very fresh memory and German conservatives, who already hated Hirschfeld, seized upon his Francophile speech in the film praising France for legalizing homosexuality in 1792 as evidence that gay rights were "un-German".{{sfn|Steakley|1999|p=183}}

At the end of the film, when the protagonist Paul Körner commits suicide, his lover Kurt is planning on killing himself, when Hirschfeld appears to tell him: "If you want to honor the memory of your dead friend, you must not take your own life, but instead preserve it to change the prejudices whose victim - one of the countless many - this dead man was. That is the task of the living I assign you. Just as Zola struggled on behalf of a man who innocently languished in prison, what matters now is to restore honor and justice to the many thousands before us, with us and after us. Through knowledge to justice!"{{sfn|Steakley|1999|p=187}} The reference to Émile Zola's role in the Dreyfus affair was intended to draw a parallel between homophobia and anti-Semitism, while Hirschfeld's repeated use of the word "us" was an implied admission of his own homosexuality.{{sfn|Steakley|1999|p=187}}

The anti-suicide message of ''Anders als die Andern'' reflected Hirschfeld's interest in the subject of the high suicide rate among homosexuals, and was intended to give hope to gay audiences.{{sfn|Steakley|1999|p=187}} The film ends with Hirschfeld opening a copy of the penal code of the ''Reich'' to strike out with a giant X Paragraph 175.{{sfn|Steakley|1999|p=187}}

==''Institut für Sexualwissenschaft''==
[[Image:Berlin Hirschfeld plaque.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial plaque in [[Tiergarten (Berlin)|Berlin-Tiergarten]]]]
Under the more [[Liberalism|liberal]] atmosphere of the newly founded [[Weimar Republic]], Hirschfeld purchased a villa not far from the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] building in Berlin for his new ''[[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]]'' (Institute of Sexual Research), which opened on 6 July 1919.  In Germany, the ''Reich'' government made laws, but the ''Länder'' governments enforced the laws, meaning it was up to the ''Länder'' governments to enforce Paragraph 175. Until the November Revolution of 1918, Prussia had a three-class voting system that effectively disfranchised most ordinary people, and allowed the ''Junkers'' to dominate Prussia. After the November Revolution, universal suffrage came to Prussia, which become a stronghold of the Social Democrats. The SPD believed in repealing Paragraph 175, and the Social Democratic Prussian government headed by [[Otto Braun]] ordered the Prussian police not to enforce Paragraph 175, making Prussia into a haven for homosexuals all over Germany.

The Institute housed Hirschfeld's immense archives and library on sexuality and provided educational services and medical consultations; the clinical staff included psychiatrists Felix Abraham and [[Arthur Kronfeld]], gynecologist Ludwig Levy-Lenz, dermatologist and endocrinologist Bernhard Schapiro, and dermatologist Friedrich Wertheim.&lt;ref name = "Dose2014"&gt;Ralf Dose, ''Magnus Hirschfeld: The Origins of the Gay Liberation Movement'' (New York City: Monthly Review Press, 2014); {{ISBN|978-1-58367-437-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute also housed the Museum of Sex, an educational resource for the public, which is reported to have been visited by school classes. Hirschfeld himself lived at the Institution on the second floor with his lover, [[Karl Giese]], together with his sister Recha Tobias.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=81}} Giese and Hirschfeld were a well known couple in the gay scene in Berlin, and as the latter liked to cross-dress, Hirschfeld was popularly known as "Tante Magnesia".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=90}}

People from around [[Europe]] and beyond came to the Institute to gain a clearer understanding of their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. [[Christopher Isherwood]] writes about his and [[W. H. Auden]]'s visit in his book ''[[Christopher and His Kind]]''; they were calling on [[Francis Turville-Petre]], a friend of Isherwood's who was an active member of the Scientific Humanitarian Committee. Other celebrated visitors included German novelist and playwright [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], German artist [[Christian Schad]], French writers [[René Crevel]] and [[André Gide]], Russian director [[Sergei Eisenstein]], and American poet [[Elsa Gidlow]].&lt;ref name = "Dose2014" /&gt;

In addition, a number of noted individuals lived for longer or shorter periods of time in the various rooms available for rent or as free accommodations in the Institute complex. Among the residents were Isherwood and Turville-Petre; literary critic and philosopher [[Walter Benjamin]]; actress and dancer [[Anita Berber]]; Marxist philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]]; [[Willi Münzenberg]], a member of the German Parliament and a press officer for the [[Communist Party of Germany]]; [[Dorchen Richter|Dörchen Richter]], one of the first transgender patients to receive [[sex reassignment surgery]] at the Institute, and [[Lili Elbe]].&lt;ref name = "Dose2014" /&gt; Richter had been born Rudolf Richter and being arrested for cross-dressing had come to the institute for help.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=86}} Hirschfeld had coined the term transvestite in 1910 to describe what today would be called trans-gender people, and the institution became a haven for the transgender, where Hirschfeld offered them shelter from abuse, performed surgeries, and gave otherwise unemployable trans-gender people jobs, albeit of a menial type, mostly as "maids".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=84-85}}

The Institute and Hirschfeld's work are depicted in [[Rosa von Praunheim]]'s feature film ''[[Der Einstein des Sex]]'' (''The Einstein of Sex'', Germany, 1999; English [[subtitles|subtitled]] version available). Although inspired by Hirschfeld's life, the film is fictional. It contains invented characters and incidents and attributes  motives and sentiments to Hirschfeld and others on the basis of little or no historical evidence. Hirschfeld biographer Ralf Dose notes, for instance, that "the figure of 'Dorchen' in Rosa von Praunheim's film ''The Einstein of Sex'' is complete fiction."&lt;ref name = "Dose2014" /&gt;

==World Tour==
In March 1930, the Social Democratic chancellor [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]] was overthrown by the intrigues of General [[Kurt von Schleicher]]. "Presidential" governments, responsible only to the President [[Paul von Hindenburg]], pushed German politics in a more right-wing, authoritarian direction. In 1929, the Müller government had come very close to repealing Paragraph 175, when the ''Reichstag'' justice committee voted to repeal Paragraph 175. However, the Müller government fell before it could submit the repeal motion to the floor of the ''Reichstag''.{{sfn|=Marhoefer|2011|p=538}} Under the rule of Chancellor [[Heinrich Brüning]] and his successor, [[Franz von Papen]], the state became increasingly hostile towards gay rights campaigners like Hirschfeld, who began to spend more time abroad.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=104}} Quite apart from the increased homophobia, Hirschfeld also became involved in a bitter debate within the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, as the repeal bill, championed by Müller also made homosexual prostitution illegal, which badly divided the committee.{{sfn|=Marhoefer|2011|p=541-542}} Hirschfeld had always argued that "what is natural cannot be immoral" and, since homosexuality was, in his view natural, it should be legal. Connecting the question of the legality of homosexuality to the legality of prostitution was a blurring of the issue, since these were different matters.{{sfn|=Marhoefer|2011|p=541-542}} Brüning, a conservative Catholic on the right-wing of the ''Zentrum'' party, who replaced Müller in March 1930, was openly hostile towards gay rights and the fall of Müller ended the possibility of repealing Paragraph 175.

In 1930, Hirschfeld predicted that there was no future for people like himself in Germany, and he would have to move abroad.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=104 &amp; 106}} In November 1930, Hirschfeld arrived in [[New York City|New York]], ostensibly on a speaking tour about sex, but in fact to see if it was possible for him to settle in the United States.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=104}} Significantly, in his speeches on this American tour, Hirschfeld, when speaking in German, called for the legalization of homosexuality, but when speaking in English did not mention the subject of homosexuality, instead urging Americans to be more open-minded about heterosexual sex.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=104–105}} The ''New York Times'' described Hirschfeld as having come to America to "study the marriage question", while the German language ''[[New Yorker Volkszeitung]]'' newspaper described Hirschfeld as wanting to "discuss love's natural turns" - the phrase "love's natural turns" was Hirschfeld's way of presenting his theory that there was a wide spectrum of human sexuality, all of which were "natural".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=104-105}} Hirschfeld realized that most Americans did not want to hear about his theory of homosexuality as natural. Aware of a strong xenophobic tendency in the United States, where foreigners seen as trouble-makers were unwelcome,  Hirschfeld tailored his message to American tastes.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=105}}

In an interview with the Germanophile American journalist [[George Sylvester Viereck]] for the ''Milwaukee Sentinel'' done in late November 1930 that epitomised his "straight turn" in America, Hirschfeld was presented as a sex expert whose knowledge could improve the sex lives of married American couples.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=105}} The ''Milwaukee Sentinel'' was part of the newspaper chain owned by [[William Randolph Hearst]], which initially promoted Hirschfeld in America, reflecting the old adage that "sex sells". In the interview with Viereck, Hirschfeld was presented as the wise "European expert on romantic love" who had come to teach heterosexual American men how to enjoy sex, claiming there was a close connection between sexual and emotional intimacy.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=106}} Clearly intending to flatter the egos of a heterosexual American male audience, Hirschfeld praised the drive and ambition of American men, who were so successful at business, but stated that American men needed to divert some of their energy to their sex lives.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=106}} Hirschfeld added, he had seen signs that American men were now starting to develop their "romantic sides" as European men had long since done, and he had come to the United States to teach American men how to love their women properly.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=106}} When Viereck objected that the U.S was in the middle of the Great Depression, Hirschfeld replied he was certain that United States would soon recover, thanks to the relentless drive of American men.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=106}}

At least part of the reason for his "straight turn" was financial; a Dutch firm had been marketing Titus's Pearls pills, which were presented in Europe as a cure for "scattered nerves" and in the United States as an aphrodisiac, and had been using Hirschfeld's endorsement to help with advertising campaign there.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=107}} Most Americans knew of Hirschfeld only as a "world-known authority on sex" who had endorsed the Titus's Pearls pills, which were alleged to improve orgasms for both men and women.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=107}} Since Hirschfeld's books never sold well, the money he was paid for endorsing the Titus's Pearls pills were a major source of income for him, which he was to lose in 1933 when the manufacturer of the pills ceased using his endorsement in order to stay in the German market.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=107}} In a second interview with Viereck in February 1931, Hirschfeld was presented by him as the "Einstein of Sex", which was again part of the marketing effort of Hirschfeld's "straight turn" in America.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=107}} At times, Hirschfeld returned to his European message, when he planned to deliver a talk at the bohemian [[Dill Pickle Club]] in [[Chicago]] on "homosexuality with beautiful revealing pictures", which was banned by the city as indecent.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=107-108}} In San Francisco, Hirschfeld visited San Quentin prison to meet [[Thomas Mooney]], whose belief in his innocence he proclaimed to the press afterwards, and asked for his release.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=108}}  Unfortunately for Hirschfeld, the Hearst newspapers, which specialized in taking a sensationalist, right-wing, populist line on the news, dug up his statements in Germany calling for gay rights, causing a sudden shift in tone from more or less friendly to hostile, and which effectively ended any chance of Hirschfeld being allowed to stay in the United States.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=107}}

After his American tour, Hirschfeld went to Asia in February 1931. Hirschfeld had been invited to [[Japan]] by Keizō Dohi, a German-educated, Japanese doctor who spoke fluent German and who worked at Hirschfeld's institute for a time in the 1920s.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=111}} In Japan, Hirchfeld again tailored his speeches to local tastes, saying nothing about gay rights, and merely argued that a greater frankness about sexual matters would prevent venereal diseases.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=111}} Hirschfeld sought out an old friend, a S.Iwaya, a Japanese doctor who lived in Berlin in 1900–02 and who joined the Scientific-Humanitarian committee during his time there.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=112}} Iwaya took Hirschfeld to the ''[[Meiji-za]]'' to introduce him to the [[Kabuki]] theater.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=112}} Hirschfeld become very interested in the Kabuki theater, where the female characters are played by men which, for him, indicated that Western ideas about masculinity were a cultural construct and not biological.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=112}} One of the Kabuki actors, speaking to Hirschfeld via Iwaya, who served as the translator, was most insistent about asking him if he really looked like a woman on stage and was he effeminate enough as an actor.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=112}} Hirschfeld noted that no-one in Japan looked down on the Kabuki actors who played female characters; on the contrary, they were popular figures with the public.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=112}} Hirschfeld also met a number of Japanese feminists, such as [[Shidzue Katō]] and [[Fusae Ichikawa]], whom he praised for their efforts to give Japanese women the right to vote, and greatly annoyed the Japanese government which did not appreciate a foreigner criticizing the denial of female suffrage.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=113}} Shortly before leaving [[Tokyo]] for [[China]], Hirschfeld expressed the hope that his host and translator, Wilhelm Grundert, the director of the German-Japanese Cultural Institute, be made a professor at a German university.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=112}} Grundert joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and, in 1936, was made a professor of Japanese studies at the University of Hamburg and, in 1938, become the chancellor of Hamburg university, all the while denouncing his former friend, Hirschfeld, as a "pervert".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=112}} In [[Shanghai]], Hirschefeld began a relationship with a 23-year-old Chinese man studying sexology, Tao Li, who remained his partner for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=107 &amp; 110}} Hirschfeld promised Tao that he would introduce him to German culture, saying he wanted to take him to a "Bavarian beer hall" to show him how German men drank.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=118}} Tao's parents, who knew about their son's sexual orientation and accepted his relationship with Hirschfeld, threw a farewell party when the two left China, with Tao's father expressing the hope that his son would become the "Hirschfeld of China".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=110}}

After staying in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), where Hirschfeld caused an uproar by speech comparing Dutch imperialism to slavery, Hirschfeld arrived in India in September 1931.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=113}} In [[Allahabad]], Hirschfeld met [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and gave speeches supporting the Indian independence movement, stating "it is one of the biggest injustices in the world that one of the oldest civilized nations...cannot rule independently".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=113-115}} However, Hirschfeld's Indian speeches were mainly concerned with attacking the 1927 book [[Mother India (book)|''Mother India'']] by the white supremacist American author [[Katherine Mayo]], where she painted an unflattering picture of sexuality in India as brutal and perverted, as "England-friendly propaganda".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=115}} As Mayo's book had caused much controversy in India, Hirschfeld's speeches defending Indians against her accusations were well received.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=115}} Hirschfeld, who was fluent in English, made a point of quoting from the articles written by [[W. T. Stead]] in ''The Pall Mall Gazette'' in 1885, exposing rampant child prostitution in London as proving that sexuality in Britain could also be brutal and perverted: a matter which, he noted, did not interest Mayo in the slightest.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=115}} Hirschfeld was very interested in the subject of Indian sexuality or, as he called it, "the Indian art of love".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=113}} Hirschfeld's main guide to India was [[Girindrasekhar Bose]] and, in general, Hirshfeld's contacts were limited to the English-speaking Indian elite, as he did not speak Hindi or any of the other Indian languages.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=114}} While staying in [[Patna]], Hirschfeld drew up a will naming Tao as his main beneficiary and asking, if he should die, Tao should takes his ashes to be buried at the Institute for Sexual Research in Berlin.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=118}}

In [[Egypt]], where Hirschfeld and Tao traveled to next, arriving in November 1931, Hirschfeld wrote "to the Arabs...homoerotic love practice is something natural and that Mohammad could not change this attitude".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=119}} In [[Cairo]], Hirschfeld and Tao met the Egyptian feminist leader [[Huda Sha'arawi]]-who stopped wearing the Muslim veil in 1923 and popularized going unveiled which, for Hirschfeld, illustrated how gender roles could change.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=113}} In a rebuke to Western notions of superiority, Hirschfeld wrote "the average ethical and intellectual levels of the Egyptians was equal to that of the European nations".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=119}} Hirschfeld's visit to the [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine Mandate]] (modern Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza strip) marked one of the few times when he publicly referred to his Jewishness saying, as a Jew, it was greatly moving to visit [[Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=120}} Hirschfeld was not a religious Jew, stating that ''Gottesfurcht'' ("fear of God"-i.e. religious belief) was irrational, but that he did feel a certain sentimental attachment to Palestine.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=120}} In general, Hirschfeld was supportive of Zionism, but expressed concern about what he regarded as certain chauvinist tendencies in the Zionist movement and he deplored the adoption of Hebrew as the ''lingua franca'' saying, if only the Jews of Palestine spoke German rather than Hebrew, he would have stayed.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=120}} In March 1932, Hirschfeld arrived in Athens, where he told journalists that, regardless of whether Hindenburg or Hitler won the presidential election that month, he probably would not return to Germany, as both men were equally homophobic.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=121}}

==Later life and exile==
[[Image:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|thumb|On 10 May 1933, Nazis in Berlin burned works by leftists and other authors considered "un-German", including thousands of books looted from the library of Hirschfeld's [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]].]]
On 20 July 1932, the Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] carried out a coup that deposed the Braun government in Prussia, and appointed himself the ''Reich'' commissioner for the state. A conservative Catholic who had long been a vocal critic of homosexuality, Papen ordered the Prussian police to start enforcing Paragraph 175 and to crack down in general on "sexual immorality" in Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;Marhoefer, Laurie ''Sex and the Weimar Republic: German Homosexual Emancipation and the Rise of the Nazis'', Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2015 pages 185–187.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] remained open, but under Papen's rule, the police began to harass people associated with it.

On 30 January 1933, President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler as chancellor. Less than four months after the [[Nazism|Nazis]] took power, Hirschfeld's Institute was sacked. On the morning of 6 May, a group of university students belonging to the National Socialist Student League stormed into the institution, shouting "''Brenne Hirschfeld''!" ("Burn Hirschfeld!") and began to beat up the staff and smash up the premises.&lt;ref name="BAUER"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bauer |first1=Heike |title=The Hirschfeld Archives: Violence, Death, and Modern Queer Culture |date=2017 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=9781439914335 |pages=92 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=aM6lDgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Heike+Bauer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji7JSOuo_cAhXDF5QKHcL7DeIQ6AEIMjAB |accessdate=8 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the afternoon, the SA came to the institute, carrying out a more systematic attack, removing all volumes from the library for a book-burning event four days later.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=92}} In the evening, the Berlin police arrived to announce that the institution was now closed forever.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=92}}

By the time of the book burning, Hirschfeld had long since left Germany for a speaking tour that took him around the world; he never returned to Germany. In March 1932, he stopped briefly in [[Athens]], spent several weeks in [[Vienna]] and then settled in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, in August 1932.&lt;ref name = "Wolff"&gt;[[Charlotte Wolff]], ''Magnus Hirschfeld: A Portrait of a Pioneer in Sexology'' (London: Quartet Books, 1986). {{ISBN|0-7043-2569-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he worked on a book recounting his experiences and observations from his world tour published in 1933 as ''Die Weltreise eines Sexualforschers'' (Brugg, Switzerland: Bözberg-Verlag, 1933). It was published in an English translation in the United States under the title ''Men and Women: The World Journey of a Sexologist'' (New York City: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1935) and in England under the title ''Women East and West: Impressions of a Sex Expert'' (London: William Heinemann Medical Books, 1935).

Hirschfeld had stayed near Germany, hoping to return to Berlin if the political situation improved. With the Nazi regime's unequivocal rise to power and with work completed on his tour book, he decided to go into exile in France. On his 65th birthday, 14 May 1933, Hirschfeld arrived in [[Paris]], where he lived in a luxurious apartment building at 24 Avenue Charles Floquet, facing the [[Champ de Mars]].&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt; Hirschfeld lived with Li and Giese.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=124}} In 1934, Giese was involved in a dispute by a swimming pool that Hirschfeld called "trifling" but which led French authorities to expel him.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=124}} Giese's fate left Hirschfeld very depressed.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=124}}

A year-and-a-half after arriving in France, in November 1934, Hirschfeld moved south to [[Nice]], a seaside resort on the Mediterranean coast. He lived in a luxurious apartment building with a view of the sea across an enormous garden on the [[Promenade des Anglais]].&lt;ref name = "Soetaert"&gt;Hans P. Soetaert &amp; Donald W. McLeod, "Un Lion en hiver: Les Derniers jours de Magnus Hirschfeld à Nice (1934–1935)" in Gérard Koskovich (ed.), ''Magnus Hirschfeld (1868–1935): Un Pionnier du mouvement homosexuel confronté au nazisme'' (Paris: Mémorial de la Déportation Homosexuelle, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his stay in France, he continued researching, writing, campaigning and working to establish a French successor to his lost institute in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt; Hirschfeld's sister, Recha Tobias, did not leave Germany and was gassed at a death camp in 1942.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=81}}

While in France, Hirschfeld finished a book he had been writing during his world tour, ''Rassismus'' (''Racism''). It was published posthumously in English in 1938.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=14}} Hirschfeld wrote that the purpose of the book was to explore "the racial theory which underlines the doctrine of racial war," saying that he himself "numbered among the many thousands who have fallen victim to the practical realization of this theory."{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=14}}

Unlike many who saw the ''völkisch'' ideology of the Nazi regime as an aberration and retrogression from modernity, Hirschfeld insisted that it had deep roots, going back to the German Enlightenment in the 18th century, and was very much a part of modernity rather than an aberration.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=15}} He added that, in the 19th century, an ideology dividing all of humanity into biologically different races — white, black, yellow, brown and red — as devised by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] served as a way of turning prejudices into a "universal truth", apparently validated by science.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=15}} In turn, Hirschfeld held that this pseudo-scientific way of dividing humanity was the basis of Western thinking about modernity, with whites being praised as the "civilized" race in contrast to the other races, which were dismissed for their "barbarism"; such thinking was used to justify white supremacy.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=15}}

In this way, he argued that the ''völkisch'' racism of the National Socialist regime was only an extreme variant of prejudices held throughout the Western world, and the differences between Nazi ideology and racism in other nations were of degree rather than of kind.{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=15}}  Hirschfeld argued against this way of seeing the world, writing "if it were practical, we should certainly do well to eradicate the use of the word 'race' as far as subdivisions of the human species are concerned; or if we do use it in this way, to put into quote marks to show it is questionable".{{sfn|Bauer|2017|p=15}}

The last of Hirschfeld's books published during his lifetime, ''L'Ame et l'amour, psychologie sexologique'' [The Human Spirit and Love: Sexological Psychology] (Paris: [[Gallimard]], 1935), was published in French in late April 1935;&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Koskovich, "Des Dates clés de la vie de Magnus Hirschfeld", in Koskovich (ed.), ''Magnus Hirschfeld (1868–1935)''.&lt;/ref&gt; it was his only book that was never published in a German-language edition. In the preface, he described his hopes for his new life in France:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In search of sanctuary, I have found my way to that country, the nobility of whose traditions, and whose ever-present charm, have already been as balm to my soul. I shall be glad and grateful if I can spend some few years of peace and repose in France and Paris, and still more grateful to be enabled to repay the hospitality accorded to me, by making available those abundant stores of knowledge acquired throughout my career.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Hirschfeld, ''Sex in Human Relationships'' (London: John Lane The Bodley Head, 1936), pp. xix–xx; translated from the original French edition by John Rodker.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On his 67th birthday, 14 May 1935, Hirschfeld died of a [[heart attack]] in his apartment at the Gloria Mansions I building at 63 [[Promenade des Anglais]] in Nice.&lt;ref name = "Soetaert" /&gt; His body was cremated, and the ashes interred in a simple tomb in the [[Russian Orthodox Cemetery, Nice|Caucade Cemetery]] in Nice.&lt;ref name="Wolff"/&gt; The upright headstone in gray granite is inset with a bronze bas-relief portrait of Hirschfeld in profile by German sculptor and decorative artist [[Arnold Zadikow]] (1884–1943), who like Hirschfeld was a native of the town of Kolberg.

On 14 May 2010, to mark the 75th anniversary of Hirschfeld's death, a French national organization, the Mémorial de la Déportation Homosexuelle (MDH), in partnership with the new LGBT Community Center of Nice (Centre LGBT Côte d'Azur), organized a formal delegation to the cemetery. Speakers recalled Hirschfeld's life and work and laid a large bouquet of pink flowers on his tomb; the ribbon on the bouquet was inscribed ''"Au pionnier de nos causes.

==Legacy==
American [[Henry Gerber]], attached to the [[Third United States Army#Army of Occupation|Allied Army of Occupation]] following World War I, became impressed by Hirschfeld and absorbed many of the doctor's ideas. Upon his return to the United States, Gerber was inspired to form the short-lived Chicago-based [[Society for Human Rights]] in 1924, the first known gay rights organization in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, a partner of one of the former members of the Society communicated the existence of the society to Los Angeles resident [[Harry Hay]] in 1929; Hay would go on to help establish the [[Mattachine Society]] in 1950, the first national homosexual rights organization to operate for many years in the United States.

[[File:Magnus Hirschfeld.jpg|left|thumb|Bust of Magnus Hirschfeld in the [[Schwules Museum]], Berlin]]
In 1979, the [[National LGBT Federation]] established the Hirschfeld Centre, [[Ireland]]'s second gay and lesbian community centre. Although badly damaged by a 1987 fire, the centre continued to house the [[Gay Community News (Dublin)|''Gay Community News'']] magazine until 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlgf.ie/Our_History.html |title=Our History |publisher=Nlgf.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103180627/http://www.nlgf.ie/Our_History.html |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, a group of German researchers and activists founded the Magnus Hirschfeld Society (Magnus-Hirschfeld-Gesellschaft e.V.) in West Berlin, in anticipation of the approaching 50th anniversary of the destruction of Hirschfeld's Institute for Sexual Science. Ten years later, the society established a Berlin-based center for research on the history of sexology.&lt;ref name="org"&gt;Magnus-Hirschfeld-Gesellschaft (n.d.), [http://me.in-berlin.de/~magnus/ "Short information about the society,"] Magnus Hirschfeld Society website; retrieved 2011-29-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The society's stated goals are the following:&lt;ref name="org" /&gt;

* To study the history of research on sexuality and gender, of the sexual reform movement and of related scholarly disciplines and life reform movements.
* To help establish research on sexuality and gender within academic institutions.

Since the late 20th century, researchers associated with the Magnus Hirschfeld Society have succeeded in tracking down previously dispersed and lost records and artifacts of Hirschfeld's life and work. They have brought together many of these materials at the society's archives in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Dose, Ralf (2012-06-18).

The [[German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research]] established the [[Magnus Hirschfeld Medal]] in 1990. The Society awards the Medal in two categories, contributions to sexual research and contributions to sexual reform.

The [[Hirschfeld Eddy Foundation]], established in Germany in 2007, is named for Hirschfeld and lesbian activist [[FannyAnn Eddy]].

In August 2011, after 30 years of advocacy by the Magnus Hirschfeld Society and other associations and individuals, the Federal [[Cabinet of Germany]] granted 10 million euros to establish the Magnus Hirschfeld National Foundation (Bundesstiftung Magnus Hirschfeld), a foundation to support research and education about the life and work of Magnus Hirschfeld, the [[Nazi persecution of homosexuals]], German LGBT culture and community, and ways to counteract prejudice against LGBT people; the [[Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany)]] was expected to contribute an additional 5 million euros, bringing the initial endowment of the foundation to a total of 15 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus-Hirschfeld-Gesellschaft E.V.

==Portrayals in popular culture==
[[File:U.S. first edition of Robert Hichens, That Which Is Hidden (Doubleday, Doran, 1940); collection of Gerard Koskovich (San Francisco).jpg|thumb|right|U.S. first edition of Robert Hichens, ''That Which Is Hidden'' (Doubleday, Doran, 1940).]]
Magnus Hirschfeld has been portrayed in a number of works of popular culture both during his lifetime and subsequently. Following is a sampling of genres and titles:

===Caricature===
Hirschfeld was a frequent target of caricatures in the popular press during his lifetime. Historian James Steakley reproduces several examples in his German-language book ''Die Freunde des Kaisers. Die Eulenburg-Affäre im Spiegel zeitgenössischer Karikaturen'' (Hamburg: MännerschwarmSkript, 2004). Additional examples appear in the French-language book ''Derrière "lui" (L'Homosexualité en Allemagne)'' (Paris: E. Bernard, [1908]) by John Grand-Carteret.

===Film and television===
* ''[[Different from the Others]]'' (Germany, 1919); directed by [[Richard Oswald]]; cowritten by Oswald and Magnus Hirschfeld. Hirschfeld appears in a cameo playing himself. [[Karl Giese]], the young man who subsequently became Hirschfeld's lover, also had a part in the film.
* ''Race d'Ep: Un Siècle d'Images de l'Homosexualité'' (France, 1979); directed by Lionel Soukaz; cowritten by Soukaz and [[Guy Hocquenghem]]; released in the United States under the title ''The Homosexual Century''. An experimental film portraying 100 years of homosexual history in four episodes, one of which focuses on Hirschfeld and his work. French gay writer Pierre Hahn played the role of Hirschfeld.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Raymond (1994). ''Images in the Dark: An Encyclopedia of Gay and Lesbian Film and Video'' (Philadelphia: TLA Publications), page 430.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219992/ "The Homosexual Century"]; IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sibalis, Michael (2001). "Hahn, Pierre (1936–81)," in Robert Aldrich &amp; Gary Wotherspoon (eds.), ''Who's Who in Contemporary Gay &amp; Lesbian History From World War II to the Present Day'' (London &amp; New York: Routledge), pages 175f.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Desire: Sexuality in Germany, 1910–1945'' (United Kingdom, 1989); directed by Stuart Marshall. A feature-length documentary tracing the emergence of the homosexual subculture and the homosexual emancipation movement in pre-World War II Germany—and their destruction by the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Stuart (1991). "The Contemporary Political Use of Gay History: The Third Reich," in Bad Object Choices (eds.), ''How Do I Look? Queer Film and Video'' (Seattle, Bay Press).&lt;/ref&gt; According to film historian Robin Wood, Marshall "treats the burning of Hirschfeld's library and the closing of his Institute of Sexual Science as the film's...central moment...."&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;Wood, Robin (2002). "Gays and the Holocaust: Two Documentaries," in Shelley Hornstein &amp; Florence Jacobowitz, ''Image and Remembrance: Representation and the Holocaust'' (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;
* A segment on Hirschfeld appears in episode 19 of ''[[Real Sex]],'' first shown on [[HBO]] on February 7, 1998.
* ''[[The Einstein of Sex]]'' (Germany, 1999); directed by [[Rosa von Praunheim]]. A fictional biopic inspired by Hirschfeld's life and work.
* ''[[Paragraph 175 (film)]]'' (USA, 2000); directed by [[Rob Epstein]] and [[Jeffrey Friedman (filmmaker)]]. A feature-length documentary on the persecution of homosexuals during the Nazi regime. The first part of the film provides a brief overview of the history of the homosexual emancipation movement in Germany from the late-19th century through the early 1930s, with Hirschfeld and his work prominently featured.&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt;
*  Several episodes of the second season of the Amazon television series ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]'' (USA, 2014–) include a portrayal of Hirschfeld and his institute, with its residents played by extras and recurring actors from the series proper. Hirschfeld himself is played by [[Bradley Whitford]].

===Fiction===
* [[Robert Smythe Hichens|Robert Hichens]] (1939). ''That Which Is Hidden'' (London: Cassell &amp; Company). U.S. Edition: New York: Doubleday, Doran &amp; Company, 1940. The novel opens with the protagonist visiting the tomb of a famed Austrian sex expert, Dr. R. Ellendorf, in a cemetery in Nice. At the tomb, he meets the late doctor's protégé, a Chinese student named Kho Ling. The character of Ling refers to the memory of his mentor at numerous points in the novel. From the description of the settings and the characters, Ellendorf clearly was inspired by Hirschfeld, and Ling by Hirschfeld's last partner and heir, Li Shiu Tong (Tao Li).&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, J. Edgar (2006–11).

In 2001 Weiner-Davis released a sequel to ''[[Divorce Busting]]'', ''The Divorce Remedy'':''The Proven 7-Step Program for Saving Your Marriage''.&lt;ref name="save"/&gt; After hearing from thousands of readers over the years who asked particular questions about their own marital circumstances, Weiner-Davis extracted the ideas from her experience and past books and then broke down the ideas into seven specific steps a person could follow. She also discusses some other key relationship issues such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[infidelity]], [[Internet addiction disorder|Internet obsession]], [[sexual problems]] &amp; [[midlife crisis]].

In 2003 Weiner-Davis released her book ''The Sex-Starved Marriage'': ''A Couple's Guide to Boosting Their Marriage Libido''.&lt;ref name="Savers"/&gt;  She found herself writing about this particular subject after she saw a pattern developing in her practice&lt;ref name="appetite"/&gt; and determined that a lack of physical intimacy between couples had been leading couples further apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Weiner-Davis' latest book ''Healing From Infidelity: The Divorce Busting Guide to Rebuilding Your Marriage After an Affair'' was released in January 2017. Due to the high percentage of couples in her practice who face betrayal, she developed a step-by-step program for rebuilding trust and reinventing couples' marriages.

The university and the municipality of Junín, are the mainstays of the Buenos Aires Northwestern Technological Center (''Polo Tecnológico del Noroeste Bonaerense'') and the Regional Research Laboratory in Biofuels, both projects located in [[Junín, Buenos Aires Province|Junin]]. On the other hand, the Pergamino Biotechnology Center the School of Agricultural, Environmental and Natural Sciences (ECANA in Spanish) are being developed in [[Pergamino]]. It also has agreements with the [[National Agricultural Technology Institute]] (INTA) and the [[Maiztegui National Human Viral Disease Institute]] (INEVH) of [[Pergamino]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11605">'''New York State Theatre Institute''' (NYSTI) was a [[New York state public-benefit corporations|New York State public-benefit corporation]] that organized [[theatre in education|theatre education]] programs for young people in [[New York State]]. Its forerunner was created by statute in 1974. The Institute produced over 30 plays and musicals for family and school audiences, and provided a theatre-arts school, summer programs, and internships. The company toured within New York State and abroad. The Institute closed in 2010 following a State enquiry into alleged irregularities.


==History==
In 1974, the [[New York Legislature|New York State Legislature]] enacted legislation creating the Empire State Youth Theatre Institute (ESYTI) under the guardianship of The State University of New York. Its Founding Director was Patricia B. Snyder.&lt;ref name=chirico&gt;Chirico, Lorraine. [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-494880571.html "PRIME DONNE: ITALIAN AMERICAN WOMEN IN THE ARTS."] Italian America. Order Sons of Italy in America. October 31, 2002. Retrieved March 01, 2017 from HighBeam Research.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, through a collaboration with "the Egg" (the Empire State Plaza Performing Arts Center) it became known as the Empire State Institute for the Performing Arts (ESIPA).  In 1992, with impending closure for financial reasons,&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Anker. [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-22408917.html "IT MAY BE CURTAINS FOR STATE THEATER TROUPE BUDGET AX COULD FALL ON NEW YORK GROUP THAT STAGED 'WIZARD OF OZ'."] The Buffalo News (Buffalo, NY). Dialog LLC. June 15, 1992. Retrieved March 01, 2017 from HighBeam Research.&lt;/ref&gt; the New York State Legislature reconstituted the organization as a [[public benefit corporation]] and renamed it the New York State Theatre Institute (NYSTI).&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The institute later moved to the [[Troy, New York|Troy]] campus of [[Russell Sage College]].&lt;ref name=NYT2006 /&gt; 

NYSTI was the first state mandated theatre education program for children in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;McCaslin, 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;132.&lt;/ref&gt; The Theatre Institute's programs were piloted in 1975 at Lake Avenue Elementary School in Saratoga Springs, New York and at the Empire State Plaza MeetingRoom 6.  The program officially began in September 1976 and continued on an 11-month basis until December 31, 2009. Following financial difficulties and an official enquiry into alleged [[nepotism]] and misuse of funds, the institute closed at the end of 2010.&lt;ref name="timesunion"&gt;{{cite news|title=$200,000 halts probe of NYSTI|url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/200-000-halts-probe-of-NYSTI-1648664.php|work=Times Union|date=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
NYSTI's mission was fourfold: 1) to produce professional theatre of the highest artistic standards for family and school audiences; 2) to use those productions to provide provocative and innovative arts in education programs; 3) to exchange theatre, culture, and humanity with the people and artists of other nations; and 4) to develop new plays and musicals for family audiences.

==Methods and educational programs==
Performers, technicians, staff, and guest artists used theatre to motivate school students to find new interest in their daily subjects. The Institute's educational services included Pre-Show Intros and [[Study guide|Study Guides]], Inservices, [[Interdisciplinarity|inter-disciplinary]] classes following performances, educational outreach programs, a Theatre Arts School, summer theatre programs, and an extensive intern and educator-in-residence program.&lt;ref name=chirico /&gt; All members of NYSTI's professional staff participated in educational programs.

==Internships==
Internships provided [[school-to-work transition]] experience for [[High school|high-school]] seniors as well as college undergraduate and [[Graduate school|graduate students]] from schools in New York and other states, as well as from other countries.&lt;ref name="Hamadeh2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samer Hamadeh|title=Vault Guide to Top Internships|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7BmQwjwPKl0C&amp;pg=PA305|year=2004|publisher=Vault Inc.|isbn=978-1-58131-291-1|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each intern was assigned a mentor from the professional staff to guide and assist the intern. More than 1,500 interns from more than 90 colleges, high school seniors, and thirteen foreign nations worked and studied at NYSTI.

==International exchange==
The Institute always maintained a commitment to international cultural exchange beginning with the tour of “[[Adaptations of The Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]” to Moscow in 1974 by the troupe from the [[University at Albany, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Albany]] whose leadership later founded the Institute. In 1986, the Institute became the first [[theatre company]] from the United States to perform in the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] upon resumption of cultural relations between the two countries. The company returned to Russia in 1989 and twice hosted visits to the United States by the Moscow Musical Theatre. NYSTI also represented its state and nation in cultural exchanges with Canada, England, France, Israel, Italy, Sweden and Jordan, including a month-long performance run in [[West End of London|London's West End]]. NYSTI hosted more than thirty foreign artists or companies from such places as Russia, Israel, Jordan, Sweden, Scotland, Hungary, England, France, Canada, and Japan.

==New plays and musicals==
Eight of NYSTI's premieres were accepted for licensing and publication by [[Samuel French Inc.]], the world's largest publisher of plays. Among NYSTI's count of more than forty-five premiere productions were [[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson's]] “Rag Dolly,” which toured to Moscow in 1986 (a later version opened on Broadway as Raggedy Ann) and [[Paul Shyre|Paul Shyre's]] “Hizzoner!,” starring [[Tony Lo Bianco]], which won five [[Emmy Award|Emmy awards]] in a WNET/13 co-production and later played on Broadway before touring to Moscow in 1989.&lt;ref name=chirico /&gt; The New York and East Coast premiere of [[Jeffrey Sweet]]'s “American Enterprise,” was nominated by the [[Outer Critics Circle Award|Outer Critics Circle]] for its 1994 John Gassner Playwriting Award and chosen for special citation in The Best Plays of 1993-1994.

[[Warner Music Group]] awarded NYSTI $400,000 in 1996 to develop five new musicals for family audiences. The first of those was “A Tale of Cinderella” by W.A.Frankonis, Will Severin, and [[George David Weiss]], made possible in part by funding provided by [[Warner Music Group]] and by the participation of [[Warner/Chappell Music]], Inc.  Warner Bros. Publications also published “Vocal Selections from ‘A Tale of Cinderella’.” The video was broadcast nationwide on PBS stations. In the 2000-01 season, “A Tale of Cinderella” toured all the major cities of New York including Buffalo, Syracuse, the Capital Region, and Manhattan.&lt;ref name=chirico /&gt;

Other new musicals developed with the Warner Music Group grant were “The Silver Skates,” “Magna Carta,” and “The Snow Queen” (which toured to London’s West End and won numerous awards for its [[audiobook]]).

==National touring==
In addition to its tour of “A Tale of Cinderella,” NYSTI toured its education programs and performances to [[New York City]], with productions of Institute originals “Sleeping Beauty” and “Beauty and the Beast,” and new stagings of “Narnia” and “Slow Dance on the Killing Ground.” The theatre company also performed at [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|the Kennedy Center]], [[Ford's Theatre]], Queens Theatre in the Park, the [[Fulton Opera House]], and the Honolulu Theatre for Youth.

==Audio books==
In later years, NYSTI, through Family Classic Audio, began producing audio books. Ten of its titles won awards from five national presenters in all kinds of genres: musicals, mysteries, and dramas. Two titles won [[Audie Awards]] from the Audio Publishers Association (“The Killings Tale,” “Sherlock’s Secret Life”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-66496061.html "The New York State Theatre Institute.(Brief Article)."] American Theatre. Theatre Communications Group. October 1, 2000. Retrieved March 01, 2017 from HighBeam Research.&lt;/ref&gt; and another six were named Audie Award Silver Finalists (“Hollowville,” “Sherlock’s Legacy,” “King of Shadows,” “Heart of Troy,” “Zoe Caldwell reads [[Oscar Wilde]] [[Fairy tale|Fairy Tales]],” “A Little Princess”). AudioFile magazine gave its Earphones Award to “A Tale of Cinderella” and “The [[The Snow Queen|Snow Queen]].” [[ForeWord (magazine)|Foreword magazine]] named “The Snow Queen” a finalist for its ‘Book of the Year’ award and the Independent Book Publishers Association also recognized “The Snow Queen” with a Benjamin Franklin Award. “King of Shadows,” also received a nomination for a Benjamin Franklin Award. [[USA Book News]] gave “The Killings Tale” its Best Books Award and named “The Snow Queen” a finalist.

The investigation went on for over a year and led to a report by the New York State Inspector's Office, issued in April 2010, alleging corruption, mismanagement, nepotism and possibly illegal conduct at the theatre. It claimed that the Producing Director improperly used state money to pay herself and her family, and to subsidize trips to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/21/nyregion/21theater.html?hp "Report Finds Corruption in N.Y.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6643">The '''Occupational Information Network''' ('''O*NET''') is a free [[online database]] that contains hundreds of occupational definitions to help students, job seekers, businesses and workforce development professionals to understand today's world of work in the United States. It was developed under the sponsorship of the [[United States Department of Labor|US Department of Labor]]/[[Employment and Training Administration]] (USDOL/ETA) through a grant to the North Carolina Employment Security Commission (now part of the NC Commerce Department) during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onetcenter.org/overview.html About O*NET]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John L. Holland]]'s vocational model, often referred to as the [[Holland Codes]], is used in the "Interests" section of the O*NET.&lt;ref name=replace/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onetonline.org/find/descriptor/browse/Interests/ O*NET OnLine: Interests]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
From 1938 to the 1990s, vocational lists and employment matching offered by the U.S. government were available through the book, ''The [[Dictionary of Occupational Titles]]'' or the DOT. The DOT was first published in 1938 and "emerged in an [[industrial economy]] and emphasized [[blue-collar]] jobs. Updated periodically, the DOT provided useful occupational information for many years. But its usefulness waned as the economy shifted toward [[Information economy|information and services]] and away from heavy industry."&lt;ref name=replace&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/opub/ooq/1999/Spring/art01.pdf Replace with a database: O*NET replaces the Dictionary of Occupational Titles]&lt;/ref&gt; With the shift in the economy, plans developed to replace the book format of the DOT with an online database. A limited use, preliminary version was released in December 1997, followed by a public edition in December 1998.&lt;ref name=replace/&gt; The O*NET thus,  "supersedes the seventy-year-old Dictionary of Occupational Titles with current information that can be accessed online or through a variety of public and private sector career and labor market information systems."&lt;ref name=desc/&gt; The decision to move from the DOT to O*NET, "remains controversial (e.g., Gibson, Harvey, &amp; Harris, 2007; Harvey, 2009; Harvey &amp; Hollander, 2002), even as we approach the 20-year anniversary of its inception (e.g., APDOT, 1992). Many applied psychologists have praised O*NET (e.g., Peterson, Mumford, Borman, Jeanneret, Fleishman, Levin, Campion, Mayfield, Morgeson, Pearlman, Gowing, Lancaster, Silver, &amp; Dye, 2001)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harvey.psyc.vt.edu/Documents/SIOP.2011.harvey.jcv%20Rs.pdf|title=Deriving Synthetic Validity Models: Is {{math|''R''{{=}}.80}} Large Enough?|last=Harvey|first=Robert J.|date=|website=|publisher=[[Virginia Tech]]|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20130828163148/http://harvey.psyc.vt.edu/Documents/SIOP.2011.harvey.jcv%20Rs.pdf|archive-date=28 August 2013|dead-url=|access-date=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The O*NET system varies from the DOT in a number of ways. It is a digital database which offers a "flexible system, allowing users to reconfigure data to meet their needs" as opposed to the "fixed format" of the DOT;  it reflects the employment needs of an [[Information society]] rather than an [[Industrial society]]; costs the government and users much less than a printed book would,  
and is easier to update as new data is collected.&lt;ref name=replace/&gt; The [[United States Department of Labor|US Department of Labor]]/[[Employment and Training Administration]] (USDOL/ETA) describes the O*NET as: "a database of occupational requirements and worker attributes. It describes occupations in terms of the skills and knowledge required, how the work is performed, and typical work settings. It can be used by businesses, educators, job seekers, human resources professionals, and the publicly funded Workforce Investment System to help meet the talent needs of our competitive global economy. O*NET information helps support the creation of industry competency models."&lt;ref name=desc&gt;[http://www.doleta.gov/programs/onet/ O*NET - beyond information - intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt;

For each job, O*NET provides the following information:
* Personal requirements: the skills and knowledge required to perform the work
* Personal characteristics: the abilities, interests and values needed to perform the work
* Experience requirements: the training and level of licensing and experience needed for the work
* Job requirements: the work activities and context, including the physical, social, and organizational factors involved in the work
* Labor market: the occupational outlook and the pay scale for the work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz &amp; Schultz|first=Duane|title=Psychology and work today|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|isbn=0-205-68358-4|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4375">An '''open-access repository''' or '''open archive''' is a digital platform that holds research output and provides free, immediate and permanent access to research results for anyone to use, download and distribute. To facilitate [[open access]] such repositories must be [[interoperable]] according to the [[Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting]] (OAI-PMH). [[Search engines]] harvest the content of open access repositories, constructing a database of worldwide, free of charge available research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Jacobs | first1 = Neil| title = Open Access: Key Strategic, Technical and Economic Aspects| publisher = Elsevier| date = 2006| pages = 11| url = https://www.elsevier.com/books/open-access/jacobs/978-1-84334-203-8| isbn = 9781843342038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to a simple [[institutional repository]] or [[disciplinary repository]], open-access repositories provide free access to research for users outside the institutional community and are one of the recommended ways to achieve the [[open access]] vision described in the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] definition of open access. This is sometimes referred to as the [[self-archiving]] or "green" route to open access.

== Benefits ==
The benefits of open-access repositories, as opposed to conventional digital [[institutional repositories]], are:
* Opening up outputs of the institution to a worldwide audience;
* Maximizing the visibility and impact of these outputs as a result;
* Showcasing the institution to interested constituencies – prospective staff, prospective students and other stakeholders;
* Collecting and curating digital output;
* Managing and measuring research and teaching activities;
* Providing a workspace for work-in-progress, and for collaborative or large-scale projects;
* Enabling and encouraging interdisciplinary approaches to research;
* Facilitating the development and sharing of digital teaching materials and aids, and
* Supporting student endeavours, providing access to theses and dissertations and a location for the development of e-portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swan|first=Alma|title=Open Access institutional repositories: A Briefing Paper (2009)|url=http://www.openscholarship.org/upload/docs/application/pdf/2009-01/open_access_institutional_repositories.pdf|work=Open Scholarship|access-date=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phyllis Forbes Dennis''' ({{née|'''Bottome'''}} {{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|t|oʊ|m}} {{respell|bə|TOHM|'}}; 31 May 1884 – 22 August 1963) was a British novelist and short story writer.&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Miller, ''BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names'' (Oxford UP, 1971), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Bottome was born in [[Rochester, Kent]], the daughter of an American clergyman, Rev. William MacDonald Bottome and an Englishwoman, Mary (Leatham) Bottome.&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth Century Authors: A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Literature'', edited by [[Stanley Kunitz|Stanley J. Kunitz]] and Howard Haycraft, New York, The H. W. Wilson Company, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1917, in Paris, she married Alban Ernan Forbes Dennis, a British diplomat working firstly in Marseilles and then in Vienna as [[Passport Control Officer]], a cover for his real role as MI6 Head of Station with responsibility for Austria, Hungary and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;''Ian Fleming'' by Andrew Lycett, Phoenix, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}} Forbes Dennis died in July 1972 in [[Brighton]].

Bottome studied [[individual psychology]] under [[Alfred Adler]] while in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name="Dumont, Herve 2006"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

In 1924 she and her husband started a school in [[Kitzbühel]] in Austria. Based on the teaching of languages, the school was intended to be a community, and an educational laboratory to determine how psychology and educational theory could cure the ills of nations. One of their more famous pupils was [[Ian Fleming]], author of the [[List of James Bond novels and short stories|James Bond novels]]. In 1960, Fleming wrote to Bottome, "My life with you both is one of my most cherished memories, and heaven knows where I should be today without Ernan."&lt;ref&gt;'' The Life of Ian Fleming'' John Pearson, Jonathan Cape, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}} It has been argued that Fleming took the idea of [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] from the character Mark Chalmers in Bottome's spy novel ''The Lifeline''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=West |first1=Nigel |author-link1=Rupert Allason |year=2004 |chapter=Fiction, Faction and Intelligence |editor1-last=Scott |editor1-first=L.

BBC Radio 4. Retrieved 10 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, her novel ''[[Private Worlds]]'' was made into a film. Set in a psychiatric clinic, Bottome's knowledge of individual psychology proved useful in creating a realistic scene. Bottome saw her share of trouble with ''[[Danger Signal]]'' which the [[Hays Office]] forbade from becoming a Hollywood film. Germany became Bottome's home in the late 1930s,&lt;ref name="Dumont, Herve 2006"&gt;Dumont, Herve. ''Frank Borzage.'' London: McFarland &amp; Company, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}} and it inspired her novel ''The Mortal Storm'', [[The Mortal Storm|the film of which]] was the first to mention [[Hitler]]'s name and be set in [[Nazi Germany]]. Bottome was an active [[anti-fascist]].&lt;ref&gt;Angela Ingram and [[Daphne Patai]], (eds.) ''Rediscovering Forgotten Radicals: British Women Writers, 1889-1939''. University of North Carolina Press, 2009
{{ISBN|0807844144}} (p.19-20)&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, four of her works – ''Private Worlds'', ''The Mortal Storm'',  ''Danger Signal'', ''[[Heart of a Child|The Heart of a Child]]'' – were adapted to film.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0098712}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to fiction she is also known as an [[Adlerian]] who wrote a biography of [[Alfred Adler]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=ijp.040.0066b Psychoanalytic Electronic Publishing]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bottome died in [[London]].

There is a large collection of her literary papers and correspondence in the [[British Library]] (Add MSS 78832-78903).

'''''Planetary Radio''''' is a weekly 30-minute [[radio show]] devoted to [[space exploration]] and [[astronomy]], hosted and produced by [[Mat Kaplan]] and [[The Planetary Society]]. The show's programming consists mostly of interviews and telephone-based conversations with scientists, engineers, project managers, artists, writers, [[astronauts]] and many other professionals who can provide some insight or perspective into the current state of space exploration. It made its debut on November 25, 2002 with an interview with Planetary Society executive director [[Louis Friedman|Louis D. Friedman]], airing on [[Windows Media]] and local radio station [[KUCI]]. The show became available in MP3 format for download in early July 2004, and became available as a [[podcast]] in May 2005.

== Format ==
The show typically begins with a summary of that week's programming. Following this introduction, regular segments each week feature The Planetary Society's "Planetary Evangelist" and space science blogger [[Emily Lakdawalla]], the Society's CEO [[Bill Nye]], and the Society's Director of Science and Technology Bruce Betts. These regular guests provide information and perspective on advances in space science and exploration. The show usually also features interviews and conversations with scientists, engineers, designers, analysts, writers, activists, astronauts and others involved in space exploration, advocacy and education. At the end of the program, a light-hearted segment called "What's Up" with [[Bruce Betts]] usually highlights where and when you can see significant astronomical events that week, a random space fact, announcements of any anniversaries, and a space trivia contest where randomly chosen participants can usually win a T-shirt, poster or calendar.

The series goes on the road several times each year with ''Planetary Radio Live''.  These shows are usually produced before live audiences in Pasadena, California.  Whenever possible ''Planetary Radio Live'' shows take place at major space and science-related events.

== Current stations and services ==

As of June 2009 there are over 150 radio stations and services across the US and the world currently broadcasting ''Planetary Radio'', along with [[Sirius XM Satellite Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/radio/stations.html Planetary Radio Carriage Guide], The Planetary Society Web Site, retrieved 2007-01-15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical guests ==
{{Main|List of historical guests of Planetary Radio}}

Many of the speakers are significant individuals in their fields in science, engineering and technology. Prior guests have included science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]], leaders in industry like [[Elon Musk]], and many astronauts like [[Buzz Aldrin]] and [[Sally Ride]].

== Episodes ==

Over 300 episodes of ''Planetary Radio'' have been produced to date as of October 2008. Archives of previous shows are available and new programs are normally released on Mondays.

'''Progressive education''' is a [[pedagogical]] movement that began in the late nineteenth century; it has persisted in various forms to the present. The term ''progressive'' was engaged to distinguish this education from the traditional Euro-American [[curricula]] of the 19th century, which was rooted in classical preparation for the [[university]] and strongly differentiated by [[social class]]. By contrast, progressive education finds its roots in present [[experience]].   Most progressive education programs have these qualities in common&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/progressive-education-how-children-learn-today-2774713|title=Progressive Education - How Children Learn|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

== Educational theory ==
Progressive education can be traced back to the works of [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], both of whom are known as forerunners of ideas that would be developed by theorists such as Dewey. Locke believed that "truth and knowledge… arise out of observation and experience rather than manipulation of accepted or given ideas".&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The progressive education movement: Is it still a factor in today's schools?
|first=William
|last=Hayes
|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education
|year=2006}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} He further discussed the need for children to have concrete experiences in order to learn. Rousseau deepened this line of thinking in [[Emile, or On Education]], where he argued that subordination of students to teachers and memorization of facts would not lead to an education.

===Johann Bernhard Basedow===
In Germany, [[Johann Bernhard Basedow]] (1724–1790) established the Philanthropinum at [[Dessau]] in 1774. He developed new teaching methods based on conversation and play with the child, and a program of physical development. Such was his success that he wrote a treatise on his methods, "On the best and hitherto unknown method of teaching children of noblemen".

===Christian Gotthilf Salzmann===
[[Christian Gotthilf Salzmann]] (1744–1811) was the founder of the [[Schnepfenthal institution]], a school dedicated to new modes of education (derived heavily from the ideas of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]). He wrote ''Elements of Morality, for the Use of Children'', one of the first books translated into English by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]].

===Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi===
[[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] (1746–1827) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[pedagogue]] and educational reformer who exemplified [[Romanticism]] in his approach. He founded several educational institutions both in German- and French-speaking regions of Switzerland and wrote many works explaining his revolutionary modern principles of education. His motto was "Learning by head, hand and heart". His research and theories closely resemble those outlined by Rousseau in Emile. He is further considered by many to be the "father of modern educational science"&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt; His psychological theories pertain to education as they focus on the development of object teaching, that is, he felt that individuals best learned through experiences and through a direct manipulation and experience of objects. He further speculated that children learn through their own internal motivation rather than through compulsion. (See Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic motivation). A teacher's task will be to help guide their students as individuals through their learning and allow it to unfold naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friedrich Fröbel===
[[Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel]] (1782–1852) was a student of Pestalozzi who laid the foundation for modern [[education]] based on the recognition that children have unique needs and capabilities. He believed in "self-activity" and play as essential factors in child education. The teacher's role was not to indoctrinate but to encourage self-expression through play, both individually and in group activities. He created the concept of [[kindergarten]].

===Johann Friedrich Herbart===
[[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] (1776–1841) emphasized the connection between individual development and the resulting societal contribution. The five key ideas which composed his concept of individual maturation were Inner Freedom, Perfection, Benevolence, Justice, and Equity or Recompense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ref=harv |last=Blyth |first=A. |year=1981 |title=From individuality to character: the Herbartian sociology applied to education| journal=British Journal of Educational Studies|volume=29 |number=1 |pages=69–79 |doi=10.2307/3120425|jstor=3120425 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Herbart, abilities were not innate but could be instilled, so a thorough education could provide the framework for moral and intellectual development.  In order to develop a child to lead to a consciousness of social responsibility, Herbart advocated that teachers utilize a methodology with five formal steps: "Using this structure a teacher prepared a topic of interest to the children, presented that topic, and questioned them inductively, so that they reached new knowledge based on what they had already known, looked back, and deductively summed up the lesson's achievements, then related them to moral precepts for daily living".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ref=harv |last=Miller |first=E.J. |year=2003|title=Teaching methods, the Herbartian revolution and Douglas Clay Ridgley at Illinois State Normal University |journal=Journal of Geography|volume=102 |issue=3 |page=114 |doi=10.1080/00221340308978532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Melchior Bosco===
[[Don Bosco|John Melchior Bosco]] (1815–1888) was concerned about the education of street children who had left their villages to find work in the rapidly industrialized city of [[Turin]], Italy. Exploited as cheap labor or imprisoned for unruly behavior, Bosco saw the need of creating a space where they would feel at home. He called it an 'Oratory' where they could play, learn, share friendships, express themselves, develop their creative talents and pick up skills for gainful self-employment. With those who had found work, he set up a mutual-fund society (an early version of the [[Grameen Bank]]) to teach them the benefits of saving and self-reliance. The principles underlying his educational method that won over the hearts and minds of thousands of youth who flocked to his oratory were: 'be reasonable', 'be kind', 'believe' and 'be generous in service'. Today his method of education is practiced in nearly 3000 institutions set up around the world by the members of the [[Salesian Society]] he founded in 1873.

===Cecil Reddie===
While studying for his doctorate in [[Göttingen]] in 1882–1883, [[Cecil Reddie]] was greatly impressed by the progressive educational theories being applied there.  Reddie founded [[Abbotsholme School]] in [[Derbyshire]], England in 1889. Its curriculum enacted the ideas of progressive education. Reddie rejected rote learning, classical languages and corporal punishment. He combined studies in modern languages and the sciences and arts with a program of physical exercise, manual labour, recreation, crafts and arts. Abbotsholme was imitated throughout Europe and was particularly influential in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Encyclopædia Britannica
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/494634/Cecil-Reddie
|accessdate=10 October 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often engaged foreign teachers, who learned its practices, before returning home to start their own schools. [[Hermann Lietz]] an Abbotsholme teacher founded five schools (Landerziehungsheime für Jungen) on Abbotsholme's principles.&lt;ref name="ONDB"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people he influenced included [[Kurt Hahn]], [[Adolphe Ferrière]] and [[Edmond Demolins]]. His ideas also reached Japan, where it turned into "Taisho-era Free Education Movement" (Taisho Jiyu Kyoiku Undo)

===John Dewey===
In the United States the "Progressive Education Movement", starting in the 1880s and lasting for sixty years, helped boost American public schools from a budding idea to the regular norm. [[John Dewey]], a principal figure in this movement from the 1880s to 1904, set the tone for educational philosophy as well as concrete school reforms. His thinking had been influenced by the ideas of Fröbel and Herbart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reactions to the prevailing theories and practices in education, corrections made to these philosophies, and recommendations to teachers and administrators to embrace "the new education", provide a vital account of the history of the development of educational thinking in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Dewey placed so-called pragmatism above moral absolutes and helped give rise to situational ethics.&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Public Education|url=http://www.hyperhistory.net/apwh/essays/cot/t0w20education.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1897 [[John Dewey]] published a summary of his theory on progressive education in School Journal. His theoretical standpoints are divided into five sections outlined below.

====What education is====
Education according to Dewey is the "participation of the individual in the social consciousness of the race" (Dewey, 1897, para. 1).  As such, education should take into account that the student is a social being. The process begins at birth with the child unconsciously gaining knowledge and gradually developing their knowledge to share and partake in society.

The educational process has two sides, the psychological and the sociological, with the psychological forming the basis. (Dewey, 1897). A child's own instincts will help develop the material that is presented to them. These instincts also form the basis of their knowledge with everything building upon it. This forms the basis of Dewey's assumption that one cannot learn without motivation.

Instruction must focus on the child as a whole for you can never be sure as to where society may end or where that student will be needed or will take them.

====What the school is====
"Education fails because it neglects this fundamental principle of the school as a form of community life. It conceives the school as a place where certain information is to be given, where certain lessons are to be learned, or where certain habits are to be formed" (Dewey, 1897, para. 17) Dewey felt that as education is a social construct, it is, therefore, a part of society and should reflect the community.

"Education is the process of living and is not meant to be the preparation of future living", (Dewey, 1897), so the school must represent the present life. As such, parts of the student's home life (such as moral and ethical education) should take part in the schooling process. The teacher is a part of this, not as an authoritative figure, but as a member of the community who is there to assist the student.

====The subject matter of education====
According to Dewey, the curriculum in the schools should reflect that of society. The center of the school curriculum should reflect the development of humans in society. The study of the core subjects (language, science, history) should be coupled with the study of cooking, sewing, and manual training. Furthermore, he feels that "progress is not in the succession of studies but in the development of new attitudes towards, and new interests in, experience" (Dewey, 1897, para. 38)

====The nature of method====
The method is focused on the child's powers and interests. If the child is thrown into a passive role as a student, absorbing information, the result is a waste of the child's education. (Dewey, 1897). Information presented to the student will be transformed into new forms, images, and symbols by the student so that they fit with their development and interests. The development of this is natural. To repress this process and attempt to "substitute the adult for the child" (Dewey, 1897, para. 52) would weaken the intellectual curiosity of the child.

====The school and social progress====
For Dewey, education, which regulates "the process of coming to share in the social consciousness," is the "only sure" method of ensuring social progress and reform (Dewey, 1897, para. 60). In this respect, Dewey foreshadows [[Critical_pedagogy|Social Reconstructionism]], whereby schools are a means to reconstruct society.  As schools become a means for social reconstruction, they must be given the proper equipment to perform this task and guide their students.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1897). My pedagogical creed. ''School Journal''. 54. pp.&amp;nbsp;77–80. Retrieved on November 4, 2011 from http://dewey.pragmatism.org/creed.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helen Parkhurst===
The American teacher Helen Parkhurst (1886–1973) developed the [[Dalton Plan]] at the beginning of the twentieth century with the goal of reforming the then current pedagogy and classroom management. She wanted to break the teacher-centered lockstep teaching. During her first experiment, which she implemented in a small elementary school as a young teacher in 1904, she noticed that when students are given freedom for self-direction and self-pacing and to help one another, their motivation increases considerably and they learn more. In a later experiment in 1911 and 1912, Parkhurst re-organized the education in a large school for nine- to fourteen-year-olds. Instead of each grade, each subject was appointed its own teacher and its own classroom. The subject teachers made assignments: they converted the subject matter for each grade into learning assignments. In this way, learning became the students’ own work; they could carry out their work independently, work at their own pace and plan their work themselves. The classroom turned into a laboratory, a place where students are working, furnished and equipped as work spaces, tailored to meet the requirements of specific subjects. Useful and attractive learning materials, instruments and reference books were put within the students’ reach. The benches were replaced by large tables to facilitate co-operation and group instruction. This second experiment formed the basis for the next experiments, those in Dalton and New York, from 1919 onwards. The only addition was the use of graphs, charts enabling students to keep track of their own progress in each subject.&lt;ref name="Dalton education"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://xs4all.academia.edu/PietvanderPloeg/Dalton-education|title=Piet van der Ploeg - Rijksuniversiteit Groningen - Academia.edu|website=xs4all.academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteen-twenties and nineteen-thirties, Dalton education spread throughout the world. There is no certainty regarding the exact numbers of Dalton schools, but there was Dalton education in America, Australia, England, Germany, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, India, China and Japan.{{cn|date=February 2018}} Particularly in the Netherlands, China and Japan, Dalton education has remained in existence. In recent years there has been a revival of international interest, particularly in England, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===Rudolf Steiner===
[[Rudolf Steiner]] (1869–1925) first described the principles of what was to become [[Waldorf education]] in 1907. He established a series of schools based on these principles beginning in 1919. The focus of the education is on creating a developmentally appropriate curriculum that holistically integrates practical, artistic, social, and academic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.ibe.unesco.org/publications/ThinkersPdf/steinere.pdf Heiner Ullrich, "Rudolf Steiner"], ''Prospects: the quarterly review of comparative education'' (Paris, UNESCO: International Bureau of Education), vol.XXIV, no. 3/4, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;555–572&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/the-big-question-who-was-rudolf-steiner-and-what-were-his-revolutionary-teaching-ideas-433407.html "Who was Rudolf Steiner and what were his revolutionary teaching ideas?"

===Maria Montessori===
[[Maria Montessori]] (1870–1952) began to develop her philosophy and methods in 1897. She based her work on her observations of children and experimentation with the environment, materials, and lessons available to them. She frequently referred to her work as "scientific pedagogy", arguing for the need to go beyond observation and measurement of students, to developing new methods to transform them. Although [[Montessori education]] spread to the United States in 1911 there were conflicts with the American educational establishment and was opposed by William Heard Kilpatrick. However Montessori education returned to the United States in 1960 and has since spread to thousands of schools there.

===Robert Baden-Powell===
In July 1906, [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] sent [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] a copy of his book ''The Birchbark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians''. Seton was a British-born Canadian-American living in the United States. They shared ideas about youth training programs.&lt;ref name="SetonInfed"&gt;{{cite web |year=2002 |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/seton.htm |title=Ernest Thompson Seton and Woodcraft |publisher=InFed |accessdate=2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BPInfed"&gt;{{cite web |year=2002 |title=Robert Baden-Powell as an Educational Innovator |publisher=InFed |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-bp.htm |accessdate=2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 Baden-Powell wrote a draft called ''Boy Patrols''. In the same year, to test his ideas, he gathered 21 boys of mixed social backgrounds and held a week-long camp in August on [[Brownsea Island Scout camp|Brownsea Island]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Woolgar, Brian|author2=La Riviere, Sheila|year=2002|title=Why Brownsea?

The Brownsea camp and the publication of  ''Scouting for Boys'' are generally regarded as the start of the Scout movement which spread throughout the world. Baden-Powell and his sister [[Agnes Baden-Powell]] introduced the [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Guides]] in 1910.

===Comparison with traditional education===
{{Main|Traditional education}}

Traditional education uses extrinsic motivation, such as grades and prizes. Progressive education is more likely to use intrinsic motivation, basing activities on the interests of the child.

21st century skills are a series of higher-order [[skills]], abilities, and learning dispositions that have been identified as being required for success in the rapidly changing, digital society and workplaces.  Many of these skills are also defining qualities of ''progressive education'' as well as being associated with [[Deeper Learning|deeper learning]], which is based on mastering skills such as analytic reasoning, complex problem solving, and teamwork.  These skills differ from traditional academic skills in that they are not primarily content knowledge-based.&lt;ref name="Dede"&gt;[http://sttechnology.pbworks.com/f/Dede_(2010)_Comparing%20Frameworks%20for%2021st%20Century%20Skills.pdf Chris Dede, Comparing Frameworks for 21st Century Skills, Harvard Graduate School of Education, 2009].

===Spain===
In Spain, the [[Escuela Moderna]] was founded in 1901 by [[Francisco Ferrer]], a Catalan educator and [[anarchism|anarchist]]. He had been influenced by Cecil Reddie. The [[Modern Schools]], also called 'Ferrer Schools', that were founded in the United States, were based on Escuela Moderna. As in Spain the schools were intended to educate the working-classes from a [[secular]], [[class-conscious]] perspective. The Modern Schools imparted day-time academic classes for children, and night-time continuing-education lectures for adults.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, an early proponent of progressive education was [[Alva Myrdal]], who with her husband Gunnar co-wrote ''[[Crisis in the Population Question|Kris i befolkningsfrågan]]'' (1934), a most influential program for the social-democratic hegemony (1932–1976) popularly known as "[[Folkhemmet]]". School reforms went through government reports in the 1940s and trials in the 1950s, resulting in the introduction in 1962 of public comprehensive schools ("grundskola") instead of the previously separated parallel schools for theoretical and non-theoretical education.&lt;ref&gt;A critical overview of the bureaucratic process in Sweden is given in Inger Enkvist, ''De svenska skolreformerna 1962–1985 och personerna bakom dem'' (2016), {{ISBN|978-91-7844-954-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The ideas from Reddie's Abbotsholme spread to schools such as [[Bedales School]] (1893), [[King Alfred School, London]] (1898) and [[St Christopher School, Letchworth]] (1915), as well as all the [[Quakers|Friends']] schools, [[Waldorf education|Steiner Waldorf]] schools and those belonging to the [[Round Square (educational organisation)|Round Square Conference]]. The King Alfred School was radical for its time in that it provided a secular education and that boys and girls were educated together.&lt;ref name="proged"&gt;[http://www.kingalfred.org.uk/king-alfred-school/about-king-alfred-school/progressive-education.html A Progressive Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425045150/http://www.kingalfred.org.uk/king-alfred-school/about-king-alfred-school/progressive-education.html |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Sutherland Neill]] believed children should achieve self-determination and should be encouraged to think critically rather than blindly obeying. He implemented his ideas with the founding of [[Summerhill School]] in 1921. Neill believed that children learn better when they are not compelled to attend lessons. The school was also managed democratically, with regular meetings to determine school rules. Pupils had equal voting rights with school staff.

===United States===
====Early practitioners====
Fröbel's student [[Margarethe Schurz]] founded the first kindergarten in the United States at [[Watertown, Wisconsin]] in 1856, and she also inspired [[Elizabeth Peabody]], who went on to found the first English-speaking kindergarten in the United States – the language at Schurz's kindergarten had been German, to serve an immigrant community – in [[Boston]] in 1860. This paved the way for the concept's spread in the USA. The German émigré Adolph Douai had also founded a kindergarten in Boston in 1859, but was obliged to close it after only a year. By 1866, however, he was founding others in New York City.

[[William Heard Kilpatrick]] (1871–1965) was a pupil of Dewey and one of the most effective practitioners of the concept as well as the more adept at proliferating the progressive education movement and spreading word of the works of Dewey. He is especially well known for his "project method of teaching".&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt; This developed the progressive education notion that students were to be engaged and taught so that their knowledge may be directed to society for a socially useful need. Like Dewey he also felt that students should be actively engaged in their learning rather than actively disengaged with the simple reading and regurgitation of material.&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt;

The most famous early practitioner of progressive education was [[Francis Wayland Parker|Francis Parker]]; its best-known spokesperson was the philosopher [[John Dewey]].  In 1875 Francis Parker became superintendent of schools in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] after spending two years in Germany studying emerging educational trends on the continent. Parker was opposed to rote learning, believing that there was no value in knowledge without understanding. He argued instead schools should encourage and respect the child's creativity. Parker's [[Quincy Method|Quincy System]] called for child-centered and experience-based learning.   He replaced the traditional curriculum with integrated learning units based on core themes related to the knowledge of different disciplines. He replaced traditional readers, spellers and [[grammar]] books with children's own writing, [[literature]], and teacher prepared materials. In 1883 Parker left Massachusetts to become Principal of the Cook County Normal School in [[Chicago]], a school that also served to train teachers in Parker's methods. In 1894 Parker's Talks on Pedagogics, which drew heavily on the thinking of [[Friedrich Fröbel|Fröbel]], [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]], became one of the first American writings on education to gain international fame.

That same year, philosopher John Dewey moved from the [[University of Michigan]] to the newly established [[University of Chicago]] where he became chair of the department of [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and education. He and his wife enrolled their children in Parker's school before founding their own school two years later.

Whereas Parker started with practice and then moved to theory, Dewey began with hypotheses and then devised methods and curricula to test them. By the time Dewey moved to Chicago at the age of thirty-five, he had already published two books on psychology and applied psychology. He had become dissatisfied with philosophy as pure speculation and was seeking ways to make philosophy directly relevant to practical issues. Moving away from an early interest in [[Hegel]], Dewey proceeded to reject all forms of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and dichotomy in favor of a philosophy of experience as a series of unified wholes in which everything can be ultimately related.

In 1896, John Dewey opened what he called the laboratory school to test his theories and their sociological implications. With Dewey as the director and his wife as principal, the University of Chicago Laboratory school, was dedicated "to discover in administration, selection of subject-matter, methods of learning, teaching, and [[discipline]], how a school could become a cooperative community while developing in individuals their own capacities and satisfy their own needs." (Cremin, 136) For Dewey the two key goals of developing a cooperative [[community]] and developing [[individual]]s' own capacities were not at odds; they were necessary to each other. This unity of purpose lies at the heart of the progressive education philosophy. In 1912, Dewey sent out students of his philosophy to found [[The Park School of Buffalo]] and [[The Park School of Baltimore]] to put it into practice. These schools operate to this day within a similar progressive approach.

At Columbia, Dewey worked with other educators such as Charles Eliot and Abraham Flexner to help bring progressivism into the mainstream of American education. In 1917 Columbia established the Lincoln School of Teachers College "as a laboratory for the working out of an elementary and secondary curriculum which shall eliminate obsolete material and endeavor to work up in usable form material adapted to the needs of modern living." (Cremin, 282)  Based on Flexner's demand that the modern curriculum "include nothing for which an affirmative case can not be made out" (Cremin, 281) the new school organized its activities around four fundamental fields: [[science]], [[industry]], [[aesthetics]] and [[civics]]. The Lincoln School built its curriculum around "units of work" that reorganized traditional subject matter into forms embracing the development of children and the changing needs of adult life. The first and second grades carried on a study of community life in which they actually built a city. A third grade project growing out of the day-to-day life of the nearby [[Hudson River]] became one of the most celebrated units of the school, a unit on boats, which under the guidance of its legendary teacher Miss Curtis, became an entrée into [[history]], [[geography]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], [[arithmetic]], science, [[art]] and literature. Each of the units was broadly enough conceived so that different children could concentrate on different aspects depending on their own interests and needs. Each of the units called for widely diverse student activities, and each sought to deal in depth with some critical aspect of contemporary civilization. Finally each unit engaged children working together cooperatively and also provided opportunities for individual research and exploration.

In 1924, [[Agnes de Lima]], the lead writer on education for ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', published a collection of her articles on progressive education as a book, titled ''Our Enemy the Child''.&lt;ref&gt;Agnes de Lima.  In James Guthrie, Editor in Chief, ''Encyclopedia of Education'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;553–554).  New York: Thomson Gale (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918 The [[National Education Association]], representing superintendents and administrators in smaller districts across the country, issued its report "Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education."  It emphasized the education of students in terms of health, a command of fundamental processes, worthy home membership, vocation, citizenship, worthy use of leisure, and ethical character. They Emphasized life adjustment and reflected the social efficiency model of progressive education.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Graves, "The Cardinal Principles,", ''American Educational History Journal'' (2010) 37#1-2, pp 95-107&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1919 to 1955 the [[Progressive Education Association]] founded by [[Stanwood Cobb#Career as educator|Stanwood Cobb]] and others worked to promote a more student-centered approach to education. During the [[Great Depression]] the organization conducted the [[Eight-Year Study]], evaluating the effects of progressive programs. More than 1500 students over four years were compared to an equal number of carefully matched students at conventional schools. When they reached college, the experimental students were found to equal or surpass traditionally educated students on all outcomes: grades, extracurricular participation, dropout rates, intellectual curiosity, and resourcefulness. Moreover, the study found that the more the school departed from the traditional college preparatory program, the better was the record of the graduates. (Kohn, Schools, 232)

By mid-century many public school programs had also adopted elements of progressive curriculum. At mid-century Dewey believed that progressive education had "not really penetrated and permeated the foundations of the educational institution."(Kohn, Schools, 6,7)  As the influence of progressive pedagogy grew broader and more diffuse, practitioners began to vary their application of progressive principles.   As varying interpretations and practices made evaluation of progressive reforms more difficult to assess, critics began to propose alternative approaches.

The seeds of the debate over progressive education can be seen in the differences of Parker and Dewey. These have to do with how much and by whom curriculum should be worked out from grade to grade, how much the child's emerging interests should determine classroom activities, the importance of child-centered vs. societal–centered learning, the relationship of community building to individual growth, and especially the relationship between emotion, thought and experience.

In 1955 the publication of Rudolf Flesch's ''[[Rudolf Flesch#Professional Information|Why Johnny Can't Read]]'' leveled criticism of reading programs at the progressive emphasis on reading in context. The conservative [[McCarthy era]] raised questions about the liberal ideas at the roots of the progressive reforms. The launching of [[Sputnik]] in 1957 at the height of the [[cold war]] gave rise to a number of intellectually competitive approaches to disciplinary knowledge, such as [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study|BSCS]] biology [[Physical Science Study Committee|PSSC]] physics, led by university professors such as [[Jerome Bruner]] and [[Jerrold Zacharias]].

Some of the cold war reforms incorporated elements of progressivism. For example, the work of Zacharias and Bruner was based in the developmental psychology of [[Jean Piaget]] and incorporated many of Dewey's ideas of experiential education. Bruner's analysis of developmental psychology became the core of a pedagogical movement known as [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], which argues that the child is an active participant in making meaning and must be engaged in the progress of education for learning to be effective. This psychological approach has deep connections to the work of both Parker and Dewey and led to a resurgence of their ideas in second half of the century.

In 1965, President Johnson inaugurated the [[Great Society]] and the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] suffused public school programs with funds for sweeping education reforms. At the same time the influx of federal funding also gave rise to demands for accountability and the behavioral objectives approach of Robert F. Mager and others foreshadowed the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] passed in 2002. Against these critics eloquent spokespersons stepped forward in defense of the progressive tradition. The [[Open classroom|Open Classroom]] movement, led by [[Herbert Kohl (education)|Herb Kohl]] and George Dennison, recalled many of Parker's child centered reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow Street Nursery School--A private progressive nursery school in the West Village of Manhattan.

The late 1960s and early 1970s saw a rise and decline in the number of progressive schools.&lt;ref name="Sperounis1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick P.

* Demographics: As the baby boom passed, traditional classrooms were no longer as over-enrolled, reducing demand for alternatives.
* The economy: The [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] and recession made shoestring schools less viable.
* Times changed: With the ending of the Vietnam War, social activism waned.
* Co-optation: Many schools were co-opted by people who didn't believe in the original mission.
* Centralization: The ongoing centralization of school districts
* Non-implementation: Schools failed to implement a model of shared governance
* Interpersonal dynamics: Disagreement over school goals, poor group process skills, lack of critical dialogue, and fear of assertive leadership

Progressive education has been viewed as an alternative to the test-oriented instruction legislated by the [[No Child Left Behind]] educational funding act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Progressive Education Movement: Is it Still a Factor in Today's Schools? |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |asin=1578865212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfie Kohn]] has been an outspoken critic of the No Child Left Behind Act and a passionate defender of the progressive tradition.

Taxpayer revolts, leading to cuts in funding for public education in many states, have led to the founding of an unprecedented number of independent schools, many of which have progressive philosophies. The charter school movement has also spawned an increase in progressive programs. Most recently, public outcry against No Child Left Behind testing and [[teaching to the test]] has brought progressive education again into the limelight. Despite the variations that still exist among the progressive programs throughout the country, most progressive schools today are vitalized by these common practices:

* The curriculum is more flexible and is influenced by student interest
* Teachers are facilitators of learning who encourage students to use a wide variety of activities to learn
* Progressive teachers use a wider variety of materials allowing for individual and group research.
* Progressive teachers encourage students to learn by discovery
* Progressive education programs often include the use of community resources and encourage service-learning projects.

==In the East==
===India===
[[Rabindranath Tagore]] (1861–1941) was one of the most effective practitioners of the concept of progressive education. He expanded [[Santiniketan]], which is a small town near Bolpur in the Birbhum district of West Bengal, India, approximately 160&amp;nbsp;km north of Kolkata. He de-emphasized textbook learning in favor of varied learning resources from nature.

===Japan===
Seikatsu tsuzurikata is a grassroots movement in Japan that has many parallels to the progressive education movement, but it developed completely independently, beginning in
the late 1920s. The Japanese progressive educational movement was one of the stepping stones to the modernization of Japan and it has resonated down to the present.&lt;ref name="Japan-2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Yamasaki|first1=Yoko|title=The impact of Western progressive educational ideas in Japan: 1868–1940|journal=History of Education|volume=39|issue=5|pages=575|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00467601003687598?journalCode=thed20|accessdate=31 January 2017|doi=10.1080/00467601003687598|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unesco-IHE.JPG|thumb|250px|The Unesco IHE building in Delft.]]

'''IHE Delft Institute for Water Education''', formerly known as '''UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education''' is the largest international graduate water education facility in the world and is based in [[Delft]], [[Netherlands]]. The Institute confers fully accredited MSc degrees, and PhD degrees in collaboration with partners in the Netherlands. Since 1957 the Institute has provided graduate education to more than 15,000 water professionals from over 160 countries.

IHE Delft was formerly known as UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, which was created in 2003 from the previous IHE. This in turn was established from the International Course in Hydraulic Engineering (set up in 1957). This name changed to International Institute for Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering (IHE) in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un-ihe.org/about-ihe-delft About UNESCO-IHE]&lt;/ref&gt;

IHE Delft is instrumental in the strengthening of efforts by other universities and research centres in increasing knowledge and skills of professionals working in the water sector. The knowledge and services of IHE Delft in human and institutional capacity-building are vital to the achievement of [[Sustainable Development Goals]], especially SDG 6 (providing access to clean water and sanitation).

IHE Delft carries out three types of activities that complement and reinforce each other in the broad field of water engineering, water management, environment, sanitation, and governance. Its core activities are education, research, and capacity building, with additional functions including:

*Offering education, training, and research;
*Providing capacity development services, particularly for developing countries;
*Setting up and managing international networks of educational and water sector institutions and organizations;
*Serving as a policy forum for UNESCO Member States and other stakeholders;
*Providing professional expertise and advice on water education; and
*Playing a leadership role in international standard setting for postgraduate water education programmes and continuing professional education.

Subjects taught at the institute:
* Coastal engineering and port development
* Hydroinformatics - modelling and information systems for water management
* Flood Risk Management
* Urban Water Engineering and Management
* Sanitation

Since its inception in 1957, the Institute has provided postgraduate education to numerous professionals (engineers and scientists) almost entirely from developing/transitional countries, from over  160 countries. It has also graduated over 100 PhD candidates and executed numerous research and capacity development projects throughout the world. Many of the alumni have reached senior positions in their home countries upon return and remain key links in the global water network.

IHE Delft is a partner institute of the National SENSE Research School &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sense.nl/organisation/partners&lt;/ref&gt;. As an accredited institution, staff and students are now expected to follow the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Scientific Practice &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nwo.nl/en/policies/scientific+integrity+policy/netherlands+code+of+conduct+for+scientific+practice&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Teachers Los Angeles''' is the main representative of certified, non-administrative staff in the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]].  Prior to 1970, primary and secondary school teachers in [[Los Angeles]] were chiefly represented by a local of the ''American Federation of Teachers'' (called the ''Los Angeles Teachers Alliance'', LATA) and the ''Associated Classroom Teachers of Los Angeles'' (ACT-LA) which was affiliated to the ''National Education Association''.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.csun.edu/Collections/SCA/UAC/DFG/atola.html&lt;/ref&gt;  There were other smaller teachers unions active before 1970 that also merged into UTLA. Over a dozen different organizations merged to form UTLA.

The first broad federation of Los Angeles School District teachers was the ''Affiliated Teacher Organizations of Los Angeles'', formed between 1930 and 1932.

UTLA is very active in the political sphere of California, especially since [[Proposition 13]], which severely limited the amount that public schools can receive from property taxes.  This shifted the burden to the state and increased the competition between state funded groups.  The union has also advocated strongly against [[school voucher]] programs and attempts to break up the school district.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utla.net/node/397&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illinois Industrial University===
[[File:IllinoisIndustrialUniversity.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|The original University Hall, which stood until 1938, when it was replaced by Gregory Hall and the [[Illini Union]].

The University of Illinois, originally named "Illinois Industrial University", was one of the 37 universities created under the first [[Morrill Land-Grant Act]], which provided public land for the creation of agricultural and industrial colleges and universities across the United States. Among several cities, [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]] was selected in 1867 as the site for the new school.&lt;ref name="Illini years pg6"&gt;Illini Years: A Picture History of the University of Illinois (1950). p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Illinois Archives"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brichford|first1=Maynard|title=A Brief History of the University of Illinois|url=http://archives.library.illinois.edu/features/history.php|website=A Brief History of the University of Illinois|publisher=University of Illinois Archives|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, President [[John Milton Gregory]]'s desire to establish an institution firmly grounded in the [[liberal arts]] tradition was at odds with many state residents and lawmakers who wanted the university to offer classes based solely around "industrial education".&lt;ref name=manifesto&gt;Brichford, Maynard. (1983), ''[http://web.library.uiuc.edu/ahx/UIHISTORY.PDF A Brief History of the University of Illinois] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615013717/http://web.library.uiuc.edu/ahx/UIHISTORY.PDF |date=June 15, 2007 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; The university opened for classes on March 2, 1868, and had two faculty members and 77 students.&lt;ref name=story&gt;McGinty, Alice.

[[File:John Milton Gregory.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[John Milton Gregory]], the university's first president]]
The Library, which opened with the school in 1868, started with 1,039 volumes. Subsequently, President [[Edmund J. James]], in a speech to the board of trustees in 1912, proposed to create a research library. It is now one of the world's largest public academic collections.&lt;ref name="University of Illinois Archives"/&gt;&lt;ref name="illinois2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://illinois.edu/about/overview/facts/facts.html |title=Facts &amp;#124; Illinois |publisher=Illinois.edu |accessdate=July 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811133826/http://illinois.edu/about/overview/facts/facts.html |archive-date=August 11, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="About the University Library"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the University Library |url=http://www.library.illinois.edu/geninfo/history.html|website=About the University Library|publisher=University of Illinois|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, the Mumford House was constructed as a model farmhouse for the school's experimental farm.

===University of Illinois===
In 1885, the Illinois Industrial University officially changed its name to the "University of Illinois", reflecting its agricultural, mechanical, and liberal arts curriculum.&lt;ref name=manifesto /&gt;

During his presidency, [[Edmund J. James]] (1904–1920) is credited for building the foundation for the large Chinese international student population on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:UIUCAlma Mater2015.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Statue on campus titled "[[Alma Mater (Illinois sculpture)|Alma Mater]]" by [[Lorado Taft]]]]

[[Alma Mater (Illinois sculpture)|''Alma Mater'']], a prominent statue on campus created by alumnus [[Lorado Taft]], was unveiled on June 11, 1929. It was established from donations by the Alumni Fund and the classes of 1923–1929.&lt;ref name="Alma Mater"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alma Mater |url=http://uihistories.library.illinois.edu/virtualtour/landmarks/almamater/ |website=University of Illinois: Virtual Campus Tour|publisher=University of illinois|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many Universities, the economic depression slowed construction and expansion on the campus. The university replaced the original university hall with Gregory Hall and the [[Illini Union]]. After World War II, the university experienced rapid growth. The enrollment doubled and the academic standing improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/07/obituaries/david-d-henry-89-president-of-illinois-u-in-time-of-tumult.html| work=The New York Times | title=David . Henry, 89, President Of Illinois U. in Time of Tumult | date=September 7, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This period was also marked by large growth in the Graduate College and increased federal support of scientific and technological research. During the 1950s and 1960s the university experienced the turmoil common on many American campuses. Among these were the water fights of the fifties and sixties.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Doug, 2015,  "The (Water) Fighting Illini," ''Illinois Alumni'' Spring 2015, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign===
By 1967 the [[University of Illinois system]] consisted of a main campus in Champaign-Urbana and two Chicago campuses, Chicago Circle (UICC) and Medical Center (UIMC), and people began using "Urbana–Champaign" or the reverse to refer to the main campus specifically. The university name officially changed to the "University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign" around 1982, using the reverse of the commonly used designation for the metropolitan area, "[[Champaign-Urbana]]". The name change established a separate identity for the main campus within the University of Illinois system, which today includes campuses in Springfield ([[University of Illinois at Springfield|UIS]]) and Chicago ([[University of Illinois at Chicago|UIC]]) (formed by the merger of UICC and UIMC).

In 1998, the Hallene Gateway Plaza was dedicated. The Plaza features the original sandstone portal of University Hall, which was originally the fourth building on campus.&lt;ref name="UIHistories"/&gt; In recent years, state support has declined from 4.5% of the state's tax appropriations in 1980 to 2.28% in 2011, a nearly 50% decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=University of Illinois FY2010 Budget Request| url=http://www.pb.uillinois.edu/Documents/budgetbook/FY2012Budgetbook.pdf

{{main|Campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign}}
{{see also|Campustown (Champaign, Illinois)}}
The main research and academic facilities are divided almost evenly between the twin cities of [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]] and [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]], which form part of the [[Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area]]. The [[UIUC College of Agriculture, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences|College of Agriculture, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences']] research fields stretch south from Urbana and Champaign into [[Savoy, Illinois|Savoy]] and [[Champaign County, Illinois|Champaign County]]. The university maintains formal gardens and a conference center in nearby [[Monticello, Illinois|Monticello]] at [[Robert Allerton Park|Allerton Park]].
Four main quads compose the center of the university and are arranged from north to south. The Beckman Quadrangle and the [[John Bardeen]] Quadrangle occupy the center of the [[UIUC Engineering Campus|Engineering Campus]]. [[Boneyard Creek]] flows through the John Bardeen Quadrangle, paralleling Green Street. The Beckman Quadrangle, named after [[Arnold Orville Beckman]], is primarily composed of research units and laboratories, and features a large solar calendar consisting of an obelisk and several copper fountains. The Main Quadrangle and South Quadrangle follow immediately after the John Bardeen Quad. The former makes up a large part of the [[UIUC College of Liberal Arts and Sciences|Liberal Arts and Sciences]] portion of the campus, while the latter comprises many of the buildings of the [[UIUC College of Agriculture, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences|College of ACES]] spread across the campus map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Campus map

The campus is known for its landscape and architecture, as well as distinctive landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Campus Landmarks| url=http://www.publicaffairs.uiuc.edu/facts/landmarks.html| accessdate=August 30, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070819052401/http://www.publicaffairs.uiuc.edu/facts/landmarks.html |archivedate = August 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was identified as one of 50 college or university "works of art" by T.A. Gaines in his book ''The Campus as a Work of Art''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.appa.org/facilitiesmanager/article.cfm?ItemNumber=394&amp;parentid=203| title = Expenditures on O&amp;M at America's Most Beautiful Campuses| author = Shari L. Ellertson| publisher = APPA| accessdate =July 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus also has a number of buildings and sites on the [[National Register of Historic Places|U.S. National Register of Historic Places]] including [[Harker Hall]], [[Astronomical Observatory (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign)|Astronomical Observatory]], [[Louise Freer Hall]], the [[Main Library (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign)|Main Library]], the [[University of Illinois Experimental Dairy Farm Historic District|Experimental Dairy Farm Historic District]], and the [[Morrow Plots]]. The [[University of Illinois Willard Airport]] is one of the few airports owned by an educational institution.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Campus Operations.

=== Sustainability ===
In October 2011, the [[Sustainable Endowments Institute]] gave the campus a grade of B for sustainability in its 2011 College Sustainability Report Card. Strengths noted in the report included the campus's adoption of [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] gold standards for all new construction and major renovations and its public accessibility to endowment investment information. The university makes a list of endowment holdings and its shareholder voting record available to the public. The weaknesses are areas such as student involvement and investment priorities. The Student Sustainability Committee is empowered to allocate funding from a clean energy technology fee and a sustainable campus environment fee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssc.sustainability.illinois.edu/?page_id=5 |title=Student Sustainability Committee |access-date=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the university aims to optimize investment return but has not made any public statements about investigating or investing in renewable energy funds or community development loan funds. However, the biggest weakness of the university's sustainability is its shareholder engagement, as the university has not made any public statements about active ownership or a proxy voting policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=University of Illinois| url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/university-of-illinois| accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the University of Illinois has 11 LEED certified buildings. Three of these are platinum certified (Business Instructional Facility, Lincoln Hall, and Bousfield Hall). Three are gold (National Petascale Computing Facility, Nugent Hall, Wassaja Hall). The rest are silver (Ikenberry Dining Hall, Evers Laboratory, Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory, Illinois Fire Service Institute, and Huff Hall).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=LEED Certifications| url=http://www.fs.illinois.edu/projects/leed-certifications| accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his remarks on the creation of the Office of Sustainability in September 2008, Chancellor [[Richard Herman]] stated, "I want this institution to be the leader in sustainability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chancellor directs trustees' attention to faculty salaries | url=http://media.www.dailyillini.com/media/storage/paper736/news/2008/09/11/News/Updated.Chancellor.Directs.Trustees.Attention.To.Faculty.Salaries-3426224.shtml | accessdate=October 15, 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, he signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment, committing the University of Illinois to take steps "in pursuit of climate neutrality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment| url=http://sustainability.illinois.edu/images/Climate_Commitment.pdf| accessdate=October 20, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301222156/http://sustainability.illinois.edu/images/Climate_Commitment.pdf| archive-date=March 1, 2013| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Student government ====
[[File:Foellinger Auditorium 2007.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Foellinger Auditorium]]]]
U of I has an extensive history of past student governments. Two years after the university opened in 1868, John Milton Gregory and a group of students created a constitution for a student government. Their governance expanded to the entire university in 1873, having a legislative, executive, and judicial branch. For a period of time, this government had the ability to discipline students. In 1883, however, due to a combination of events from Gregory's resignation to student-faculty infighting, the government formally dissolved itself via [[plebiscite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Solberg|first=Winton|title=The University of Illinois and the Reform of Discipline in the Modern University, 1868-1891|journal=AAUP Bulletin|date=September 1966|volume=52|issue=3|pages=305–314 |jstor=40224166|doi=10.2307/40224166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It wasn't until 1934, when the Student Senate, the next university-wide student government, was created. A year before, future U of I Dean of Students, Fred H. Turner and the university's Senate Committee on Student Affairs gave increased power to the Student Council, an organization primarily known for organizing dances. A year after, the Student Council created a constitution and became the Student Senate, under the oversight of the Committee on Student Affairs. This Student Senate would last for 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Student Council, Committee Hold Dinner Meeting |url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&amp;d=DIL19331116|newspaper=[[Daily Illini]]|date=November 16, 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Student Senate changed its purpose and name in 1969, when it became the Undergraduate Student Association (UGSA). It no longer was a representational government, instead becoming a [[collective bargaining agency]].

In 1967, [[Bruce A. Morrison]] and other U of I graduates founded the Graduate Student Association (GSA). GSA would last until 1978, when it merged with the UGSA to form the Champaign-Urbana Student Association (CUSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blan|first=Ken|title=First GSA Meeting Monday|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&amp;d=DIL19670204|newspaper=Daily Illini|date=February 4, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="illinois1948"&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Senate Files, 1948–2008|url=http://www.library.illinois.edu/archives/archon/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&amp;id=1370|publisher=University of Illinois|accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; CUSA lasted for only 2 years when it was replaced by the Student Government Association (SGA) in 1980.

The current university student government, created in 2004, is the Illinois Student Senate, a combined undergraduate and graduate student senate with 54 voting members. The student senators are elected by college and represent the students in the Urbana–Champaign Senate (which comprises both faculty and students), as well as on a variety of faculty and administrative committees, and are led by an internally elected executive board of a President, External Vice President, Internal Vice President, and Treasurer. {{as of|2012}}, the executive board is supported by an executive staff consisting of a Chief of Staff, Clerk of the Senate, Parliamentarian, Director of Communications, Intern Coordinator, and the Historian of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iss.illinois.edu/execboard.asp |title=ISS Executive Board |publisher=Iss.illinois.edu |accessdate=July 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004063436/http://iss.illinois.edu/execboard.asp |archive-date=October 4, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BuseyHall Urbana Illinois 4543.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Busey-Evans Residence Halls]] is one of many buildings on the [[NRHP]]]]

University housing for undergraduates is provided through twenty-four [[dormitory|residence halls]] in both Urbana and Champaign. Incoming freshmen are required to live in student housing (campus or certified) their first year on campus. Graduate housing is usually offered through two graduate residence halls, restricted to students who are sophomores or above, and through three university-owned apartment complexes. Some undergraduates choose to move into apartments or the Greek houses after their second year. There are a number of private dormitories around campus, as well as 15 private, certified residences that partner with the university to offer a variety of different housing options, including ones that are cooperatives, single-gender or religiously-affiliated.&lt;ref name=PCH16&gt;{{cite web |title=Private Certified Housing FAQ |date=2016 |publisher=Private Certified Housing University of Illinois|url=http://certified.housing.illinois.edu/pch-resources/faqs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university is known for being one of the first universities to provide accommodations for students with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Education secretary UI"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wurth|first1=Julie |title=Education secretary visits UI as part of national tour|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2015-09-16/education-secretary-visits-ui-part-national-tour.html|accessdate=September 21, 2015|publisher=The News Gazette|date=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, most first-year students with disabilities will live in Nugent Hall, supported by the Beckwith Residential Support Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Beckwith Residential Support Services at Nugent Hall| url=http://disability.illinois.edu/living-accommodations/beckwith-residential-support-services-nugent-hall| accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the University of Illinois announced that they would be naming its newest residence hall after [[Carlos Montezuma]] also known as Wassaja.

=== Recreation ===
[[File:UIUC CRCE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Campus Recreation Center East]]
The campus has two main recreation facilities, the [[Activities and Recreation Center (UIUC)|Activities and Recreation Center]] (ARC) and the [[UIUC Campus Recreation Center – East (CRCE)|Campus Recreation Center – East]] (CRCE). Originally known as the Intramural Physical Education Building (IMPE) and opened in 1971, IMPE was renovated in 2006 and reopened in August 2008 as the ARC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://uihistories.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/cview?SITEID=1&amp;ID=140 |title = Intramural Physical Education Building / IMPE|date = |accessdate = April 27, 2015|website = UIHistories Project|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovations expanded the facility, adding 103,433 square feet to the existing structure and costing $54.9M. This facility is touted by the university as "one of the country's largest on-campus recreation centers." CRCE was originally known as the Satellite Recreation Center, and was opened in 1989. The facility was renovated in 2005 to expand the space and update equipment, officially reopening in March 2005 as CRCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campusrec.uiuc.edu/ |title=Campus Recreation » University of Illinois |publisher=Campusrec.uiuc.edu |accessdate=July 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709025731/http://www.campusrec.uiuc.edu/ |archivedate=July 9, 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transportation ===
The bus system that operates throughout the campus and community is operated by the [[Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District]]. The MTD receives a student-approved transportation fee from the university, which provides [[Universal transit pass|unlimited access]] for university students. In addition, the university pays for universal access for all its faculty and staff.

Six daily [[Amtrak]] trains connect Champaign-Urbana with Chicago and Carbondale (IL).  The [[City of New Orleans (train)|City of New Orleans train]] also serves Memphis, Jackson, Mississippi, and New Orleans.

[[University of Illinois Willard Airport|Willard Airport]], opened in 1954 and is named for former University of Illinois president Arthur Cutts Willard. The airport is located in Savoy. Willard Airport is home to University research projects and the university's [[University of Illinois Institute of Aviation|Institute of Aviation]], along with flights from [[American Airlines]].

U of I's Division of Intercollegiate Athletics fields teams for ten men's and eleven women's varsity sports. The university participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I. The university's athletic teams are known as the Fighting Illini. The university operates a number of athletic facilities, including [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]] for [[American football|football]], the [[State Farm Center]] for men's and women's basketball, and the Atkins Tennis Center for men's and women's tennis. The men's NCAA basketball team had a dream run in the [[2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2005 season]], with [[Bruce Weber (coach)|Bruce Weber]]'s Fighting Illini tying the record for most victories in a season. Their run ended 37–2 with a loss to the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]] in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|national championship game]]. Illinois is a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]] and [[convocation]], and athletic games are: [[Illinois Loyalty]], the school song, [[Oskee Wow Wow]], the [[fight song]], and [[Marching Illini#Hail to the Orange|Hail to the Orange]], the alma mater.

The [[University of Illinois Ice Arena]] is home to the university's club [[college ice hockey]] team competing at the [[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA Division I]] level and is also available for recreational use through the Division of Campus Recreation. It was built in 1931 and designed by Chicago architecture firm Holabird and Root, the same firm that designed the University of Illinois Memorial Stadium and Chicago's Soldier Field. It is located on Armory Drive across from the Armory. The structure features 4 rows of bleacher seating in an elevated balcony that runs the length of the ice rink on either side. These bleachers provide seating for roughly 1,200 fans, with standing room and bench seating available underneath. Because of this set-up the team benches are actually directly underneath the stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campusrec.uiuc.edu/facilities/ice_arena.html | title = Ice Arena Facility|accessdate=August 22, 2006|author=Staff

===Chief Illiniwek===
{{Main|Chief Illiniwek}}
[[Chief Illiniwek]], also referred to as "The Chief," was from 1926 to 2007 the official symbol of the University of Illinois in university intercollegiate athletic programs. The Chief was typically portrayed by a student dressed in Sioux regalia. Several groups protested that the use of a Native American figure and indigenous customs in such a manner was inappropriate and promoted ethnic stereotypes. In August 2005 the National Collegiate Athletic Association expressed disapproval of the university's use of a "hostile or abusive" image.&lt;ref name=LAT2005&gt;{{cite news |title=NCAA to crack down on hostile nicknames |first=Robyn |last=Norwood |date=August 6, 2005 |work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/06/sports/sp-ncaa6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While initially proposing a consensus approach to the decision about the Chief, the board in 2007 decided that the Chief, its name, image and regalia should be officially retired. Nevertheless, the controversy continues on campus with some students unofficially maintaining the Chief. Complaints continue that indigenous students feel insulted when images of the Chief continue to be present on campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaup.org/report/UIUC Academic Freedom and Tenure: The University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign] AAUP, April 2015, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; The effort to resolve the controversy by the current chancellor has included the work of a committee that issued a report of its "critical conversations" that included over 600 participants representing all sides, which remain sharply divided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Exhaustion-Confusion-and/244513| title=‘Exhaustion, Confusion, and Anger’: U. of Illinois Finds a Community at Odds Over Old Mascot| author=Chris Quintana|  date=September 13, 2018 | accessdate=September 16, 2018| publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
Over the last twenty years state funding for the university has fallen from 44.5% to 16.4%. Private philanthropy increasingly supplements revenue from tuition and state funding, currently providing about 19% of the annual budget.&lt;ref name="illinois1"/&gt; Notable among significant donors, alumnus entrepreneur [[Thomas Siebel|Thomas M. Siebel]] has committed nearly $150 million to the university including $36 million to build the [[Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science]] and the Grainger Foundation founded by alumnus [[W. W. Grainger]] has contributed nearly $200 million to the university over the last half-century.

==Early life and education==
Deresiewicz grew up in a Jewish home and attended a [[yeshiva]] high school.  He has described himself as being "thrown out" of the high school and has imagined that he might have been charged with "gross insubordination and incipient atheism."&lt;ref&gt;https://theamericanscholar.org/a-jew-in-the-northwest&lt;/ref&gt;

Deresiewicz received his B.A. in biology and psychology (1985), his master's in journalism (1987), and Ph.D. in English (1998) from [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deresiewicz|first=William|title=The Academic Dilemma|url=http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2012/02/21/academic-dilemma|publisher=Spectator Publishing Company|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Academia===
In 1998, Deresiewicz joined the faculty of [[Yale University]]. He taught courses in modern British fiction, [[Great Books]], Indian fiction, and writing, among other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deresiewicz|first=William|title=Long Story Short: About Me|url=http://www.billderesiewicz.com/about-me/|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left academia in 2008 to become a full-time writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ahamed|first1=Nick|title=Revisiting Deresiewicz, Part I: Addressing criticisms of ‘Excellent Sheep’ author|url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2014/10/29/revisiting-deresiewicz-part-i-addressing-criticisms-of-excellent-sheep-author/|accessdate=7 March 2017|work=The Stanford Daily|date=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writer===
In 2011, Deresiewicz published ''A Jane Austen Education: How Six Novels Taught me About Love, Friendship, and the Things that Really Matter''. In it, he divulges that his life was changed and he became a better person after reading [[Jane Austen]] for the first time at age 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flynn|first=Kathleen|title=A Jane Austen Education by William Deresiewicz|url=http://austenblog.com/2012/04/23/review-a-jane-austen-education-by-william-deresiewicz/|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His writings span such topics as books, higher education, culture, and politics. His article "The Disadvantages of an Elite Education," along with his speech "Solitude and Leadership," have gone viral on the internet. In 2014, he published ''[[Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life]]'', a book-length expansion of his argument in "The Disadvantages of an Elite Education."

==Works==

===''A Jane Austen Education: How Six Novels Taught Me About Love, Friendship, and the Things That Really Matter''===
In this memoir of a sort, Deresiewicz admits that he was initially resistant to reading 19th-century British fiction. Soon, though, he discovered that Austen’s novels are valuable tools in the journey towards becoming an adult.

Deresiewicz juxtaposes his reading of Jane Austen with insight into his own life. For example, the reader learns about his controlling father, a series of girlfriends that come and go, and the struggles of being raised in a religious household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seymour|first=Miranda|title=Lessons From Jane Austen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/books/review/book-review-a-jane-austen-education-and-why-jane-austen.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The Disadvantages of an Elite Education" and ''Excellent Sheep''===
In the summer of 2008, Deresiewicz published a controversial essay for ''The American Scholar'' titled "The Disadvantages of an Elite Education." In it, he criticizes the [[Ivy League]] and other elite colleges and universities for supposedly coddling their students and discouraging independent thought. He claims that elite institutions produce students who are unable to communicate with people who don't have the same backgrounds as themselves, noting as the first example his own inability to talk to his plumber. Deresiewicz then uses [[Al Gore]] and [[John Kerry]], graduates of Harvard and Yale (respectively), as examples of politicians who are out of touch with the lives of most Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deresiewicz|first=William|title=The Disadvantages of an Elite Education|url=http://theamericanscholar.org/the-disadvantages-of-an-elite-education/|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Disadvantages of an Elite Higher Education" went viral, receiving more than 40,000 shares on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deresiewicz|first=William|title=The Disadvantages of an Elite Education|url=http://theamericanscholar.org/the-disadvantages-of-an-elite-education/|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many readers had mixed reactions to the article, with plenty of criticism coming directly from the Ivy League, its peer institutions, and many others who accused him of [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]]. The [[IvyGate]] blog published a facetious rebuttal, "Isn't Harvard Just the Worst?", telling the Class of 2012 to "enjoy these last few months of innocence, because soon you'll join the ranks of an organization whose sole purpose is to destroy the world."

The article became the groundwork for Deresiewicz' book ''[[Excellent Sheep | Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life]]'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Press to Publish EXCELLENT SHEEP: Thinking for Yourself, Inventing Your Life, and Other Things the Ivy League Won't Teach You by William Deresiewicz|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/free-press-to-publish-excellent-sheep--thinking-for-yourself-inventing-your-life-and-other-things-the-ivy-league-wont-teach-you-by-william-deresiewicz-145774785.html|publisher=PR Newswire Association|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work had a similarly mixed response. Dwight Garner, writing for the ''[[New York Times]]'' daily book review, praised it as "packed full of what [Deresiewicz] wants more of in American life: passionate weirdness.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garner|first1=Dwight|title=The Lower Ambitions of Higher Education|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/books/excellent-sheep-william-deresiewiczs-manifesto.html?ref=arts&amp;_r=0|accessdate=8 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He characterized Deresiewicz as "a vivid writer, a literary critic whose headers tend to land in the back corner of the net," one whose "indictment arrives on wheels: He takes aim at just about the entirety of upper-middle-class life in America." Other responses, however, were more critical. In the ''[[New York Times]]'' Sunday book review, Anthony Grafton conceded that "much of his dystopian description rings true" but argued that "the coin has another side, one that Deresiewicz rarely inspects...Professors and students have agency. They use the structures they inhabit in creative ways that are not dreamt of in Deresiewicz’s philosophy, and that are more common and more meaningful than the 'exceptions' he allows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grafton|first1=Anthony|title=The Enclosure of the American Mind|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/books/review/excellent-sheep-by-william-deresiewicz.html|accessdate=8 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'', Nathan Heller was critical from another corner, arguing that the "quandaries" Deresiewicz describes are "distinctly middle-class.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heller|first1=Nathan|title=Poison Ivy|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/poison-ivy|accessdate=8 March 2017|work=New Yorker|date=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heller says that Deresiewicz argues the liberal arts "will help students hone their 'moral imagination,'" but "The advice seems cheap. When an impoverished student at Stanford, the first in his family to go to college, opts for a six-figure salary in finance after graduation, a very different but equally compelling kind of 'moral imagination' may be at play. (Imagine being able to pay off your loans and never again having to worry about keeping a roof over your family’s heads.)" Despite this mixed critical response, the book was a ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hardcover Nonfiction Bestseller List for September 7, 2014|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2014/09/07/hardcover-nonfiction/|website=The New York Times|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Solitude and Leadership"===

In October 2009, Deresiewicz delivered a speech titled "Solitude and Leadership" to the plebe class at the [[United States Military Academy at West Point]]. It was later published in ''The American Scholar'' and went viral online.&lt;ref name="TAS-solitude"&gt;{{cite web|last=Deresiewicz|first=William|title=Solitude and Leadership|url=http://theamericanscholar.org/solitude-and-leadership/|publisher=Phi Beta Kappa|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In it, he makes the case that leadership entails more than just success and accomplishment. Citing observations he made of students at Yale and Columbia, Deresiewicz discusses the ubiquity of “world-class hoop jumpers” who “can climb the greasy pole of whatever hierarchy they decide to attach themselves to.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denning|first=Steve|title=The Key Missing Ingredient In Leadership Today|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2012/07/27/the-key-missing-ingredient-in-leadership-today/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he argues, true leaders (such as General [[David Petraeus]]) are those who are able to step outside the cycle of achievement and hoop jumping in order to think for themselves.  Deresiewicz claims that solitude is essential to becoming a leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Want To Be A Leader? ‘Learn To Be Alone With Your Thoughts’|url=http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2012/02/20/leader-thoughts-alone|publisher=Boston University|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
