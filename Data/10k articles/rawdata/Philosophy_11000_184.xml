The Fifth Chapter of the [[Vaisheshika Sutra]]s of [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]] deals with the notion of action and the connected concept of effort; and also deals with the various special phenomenon of nature to the supersensible force, called '''Adrishta'''.

==Meaning==

The [[Sanskrit]] term, '''Adrishta''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अदृष्ट), as an adjective means - not seen, unseen, unobserved, unforeseen, unknown, invisible, unexpected, not experienced, destiny, fate, luck,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; not permitted or sanctioned, illegal, virtue or vice as the eventual cause of pleasure or pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=55|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.0.apte.637240}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hindu philosophy]] it refers to the unseen force, and the invisible results of works which accrue to a person; it refers to the Doctrine of [[Apurva]].

==Mimamsa concept==

Adrishta, literally meaning unseen, in the [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsa]] context refers to the invisible result of a ritual that accrues to a person, and in the [[Vaisheshika]] context, synonymous with [[Adharma]], to the equally invisible negative karmic accrual, as the unknown quality of things and of the soul, and brings about the cosmic order and arranges for soul according to their merits or demerits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism|author=Constance Jones|publisher=Infobase Publishing|pages=8–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=adrishta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lT0wEWy7ig&amp;sig=cazEv9VfyWuy32F4imKECrWlPBU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YG9bU9DgOIWnrAeczIGYDw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=adrishta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adrishta is all the elements which are not known and verified with the help of the five senses, and which can be realized through mind, intelligence and soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious Basis of Hindu Beliefs|author=Bhojraj Dwivedi|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wmqKuHFWWgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=adrishta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IrKnuRnRCS&amp;sig=J9q02x_ebfpcLF43aOAc8DkBZLg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6m5bU9O0FcmUrge_soCABA&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=adrishta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each successive birth or incarnation and its possibilities are determined by the Adrishta and Samskara acquired in the previous incarnations – Adrishta and Samskara, without which the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] has never been, because its series of incarnations never began. Adrishta is Potential worth which must have been acquired in a human state to relate to a human state; it gives unity to the multiplicity and infinite variety of beings, and of the things under their control, it binds them into a single system and an organic whole. Prashasta hints that the existence of the Universe itself though not due to Brahma’s Adrishta is not free from Adrishta (Moral merit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hindu Realism|author=Jagdisha Chandra Chaterji|publisher=Jain Publishing|pages=110, 115, 123, 172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j6Ii6Fsb7gAC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=adrishta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JNGcdtRHFZ&amp;sig=MxnCYFPi4huzMG845kpRZHwl41Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aGxbU7GDHMaQrQfwLA&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=adrishta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; All current actions and planned future actions get planted in Adrishta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Light on Relationships: The Synatry of Indian Astrology|author=Hart Defouw|publisher=Weiser Books|page=254|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQqP0LLIRR8C&amp;pg=PA254&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;dq=adrishta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GX0N0wlo9_&amp;sig=XGCz068DwsqRfvuqu6nIqaowChc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mG5bU4Udgo-tB4f4gcAP&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=adrishta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaisheshika concept==

The term Vaisheshika, appearing only once in Vaisheshika Sutra X.ii.7 and meaning characteristic or distinguishing, according to [[Pāṇini]] (Sutra IV.iii.87) is derived from the word Vishesha meaning species, distinction, difference, excellence or superiority. Uluka, who was before the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]] and is commonly known as [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]], compiled the Vaisheshika sutras. Gautama who founded the [[Nyaya]] School came later. The term Adrishta appears in Vaisheshika Sutra V.i.15:

: मणिगमनं सूच्यभिसर्पणमदृष्टकारणकम् |

: "The movement of the jewel (and) the approach of the needle, (both) have adrishtam (the invisible consequences of previous acts) as their cause."

The reason of the movement of the jewel is not a particular volition but the efficient cause is the merit of the former possessor or the demerit of the thief. The non-combative cause is its conjunction with soul possessing adrishta (or results of actions in previous states of existence) and the combinative cause is the jewel. Adrishta is also the cause of attraction of the needle towards a loadstone (magnet). Owing to adrishta is the upwards flaming of fire, the sideward motion of air and the actions of atoms at the beginning of creation. Kanada, later on, tells us that even action in earth results from impulse, impact, and conjunction with the conjunct and is caused by Adrishta (Vaisheshika Sutra V.ii.1-2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sacred Books of the Hindus Vol.VI - The Vaisheshika Sutras of Kanada 1923 Ed.|publisher=Sudhindra Nath Basu|pages=157–161|url=https://archive.org/details/thevaiasesikasut00kanauoft }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fruits or rewards of [[yajna]]s or sacrifice are not dispensed by any beneficent God. [[Apurva]] bestows the reward on the sacrificer. Apurva is the essential link between work and its result; it is a positive and unseen force created by an act that leads to the attainment of the fruit of action. This is the view of [[Jaimini]] though not implicitly mentioned by him but accepted by [[Prabhākara|Prabhakara]] and [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa|Kumarila]] as one the fundamental tenets of their respective schools. Later on, it came to be said that Apurva is the function of God. Kumarila insists that fruits of [[karma]]s accrue in this very life and not in some future life. Bharat Mitra, who lived long before [[Śābara|Sabara]] who lived long before Kumarila, does not accept Apurva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bhartrmitra|publisher=Vishal Agarwal|url=http://vishalagarwal.bharatvani.org/articles/acharyas/bhartrmitra/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Patanjali]] tells us –

: क्लेशमूलः कर्माशयो दृष्टादृष्टजन्मवेदनीयः ([[Yoga Sutras]] II.12)

that obstacles are the breeding ground for tendencies that give rise to actions and the consequences thereof; such obstacles are experienced as visible and invisible obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sadhana Pada |author=Patanjali |publisher=International Infopage for Ashtangayoga |url=http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-2/item/klesha-mulah-karma-ashayo-drishta-adrishta/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827022213/http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-2/item/klesha-mulah-karma-ashayo-drishta-adrishta/ |archivedate=2014-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swami Prabhavananda]] translates this sutra as – "A man’s latent tendencies have been created by his past thoughts and actions; these tendencies will bear fruits, both in this life and in lives to come." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Patanjali Yoga Sutras|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|page=84|url=http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/patanjali-yoga-sutras/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apurva is an epistemic mechanism that indicates knowledge of causal links between acts and their consequences. Sabara discusses this concept in his commentary on the Vaisheshika Sutras, and even claims that by the word ''codana'' ([[Sanskrit]]: चोदन -meaning precept or rule -the performative element of an injunction) [[Jaimini]] really meant Apurva; it is mentioned by Jaimini in passing, as part of purvapaksha argument in Mimamasa Sutra I.ii.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Scripture and Knowledge: An Essay on Religious Epistemology|author=Shlomo Biderman|publisher=BRILL|pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iag4ian2gf0C&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=apurva+jaimini+sutras&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OKJscyxm7C&amp;sig=XozsecUlzBCE0NsTrIdo0hrJOOM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4bhbU_u3O8OArgeNpIFw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=apurva%20jaimini%20sutras&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

The early Mimamsakas believed in an adrishta that was the result of performing [[karma]]s and saw no need for an [[Ishvara]] in their system. However, the Atomic Theory which teaches that the world is produced by the successive formation of compounds due to the aggregation of atoms resulting from the motion of atoms, the primary motion brought about by the unseen the Adrishta residing in the primary atoms and residing in the individual souls is rejected by the followers of the [[Vedanta]] (Uttara Mimamsa) schools:
: उभयथापि न कर्मातस्तदभावः | ([[Brahma Sutras]] II.ii.12)
"In either case (viz the Adrishta, the unseen principle, inhering either in the atoms or in the soul) the activity (of the atoms) is not (possible), therefore the negation of that (viz of creation through the combination of atoms)."

The Nyaya-Vaisheshika systems of philosophy derive the conception of [[moksha]] from the [[Upanishads]] but require a highly developed stage of logical thought, and care more for the instrument of knowledge than for knowledge itself. The Mimamsa system by the very nature of its ritualistic problems does not have much in common with Upanishadic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya vidya Bhavan|pages=139–140|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22473">'''Agnotology''' (formerly '''agnatology''') is the study of culturally induced [[ignorance]] or [[doubt]], particularly the publication of inaccurate or misleading [[scientific data]]. In 1995 [[Robert N.

&lt;/ref&gt;
on the basis of the [[Ancient greek#Modern use of Ancient Greek|Neoclassical Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἄγνωσις}}, ''agnōsis'', "not knowing" (cf. [[Attic Greek]] ἄγνωτος "unknown"&lt;ref&gt;See: [[wikt:ἄγνωτος|Wiktionary entry on ἄγνωτος]].&lt;/ref&gt;), and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''.&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/2005/pr-agno-100505.html |title= Conference to explore the social construction of ignorance |accessdate= 2007-08-12|date= 2005-10-04|first= Barbara |last= Palmer|publisher= Stanford News Service |quote= Proctor uses the term "agnotology" – a word coined from agnosis, meaning "not knowing" – to describe a new approach to looking at knowledge through the study of ignorance.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070724074303/http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/2005/pr-agno-100505.html| archivedate= 24 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the term also highlights the increasingly common condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before.  [[David Dunning]] of Cornell University is another academic who studies the spread of ignorance.  "Dunning warns that the internet is helping propagate ignorance – it is a place where everyone has a chance to be their own expert, he says, which makes them prey for powerful interests wishing to deliberately spread ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160105-the-man-who-studies-the-spread-of-ignorance |title= The Man Who Studies the Spread of Ignorance|last=Kenyon|first= Georgina|date= |website= |publisher= BBC|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1999 book ''The Erotic Margin'', Irvin C. Schick referred to ''unknowledge'' "to distinguish it from ignorance, and to denote socially constructed lack of knowledge, that is, a conscious absence of socially pertinent knowledge". As an example, he offered the labeling "terra incognita" in early maps, noting that "The reconstruction of parts of the globe as uncharted territory is ... the ''production of unknowledge'', the transformation of those parts into potential objects of Western political and economic attention. It is the enabling of colonialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schick |first=Irvin C. |title=The Erotic Margin: Sexuality and Spatiality in Alteritist Discourse |publisher=Verso |location=New York and London |year=1999 |pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many causes of culturally induced [[ignorance]]. These include the influence of the [[media (communication)|media]], either through neglect or as a result of deliberate misrepresentation and manipulation. [[Corporation]]s and governmental agencies can contribute to the subject matter studied by agnotology through [[secrecy]] and [[Censorship|suppression]] of information, document destruction, and myriad forms of inherent or avoidable culturopolitical selectivity, inattention, and forgetfulness.&lt;ref name=2005conf/&gt;

Proctor cites as a prime example of the deliberate production of ignorance the [[tobacco industry]]'s [[Tobacco advertising|advertising]] campaign to [[Merchants of Doubt|manufacture doubt]] about the [[cancer]]ous and other [[Health effects of tobacco|health effects]] of [[tobacco use]]. Under the banner of science, the industry produced research about everything except tobacco hazards to exploit public uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

At Stanford, we study how ignorance is manufactured. It is an art we call agnotology.)
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnotology also focuses on how and why diverse forms of knowledge do ''not'' "come to be", or are ignored or delayed. For example, knowledge about [[plate tectonics]] was [[censorship|censored]] and delayed for at least a decade because some evidence remained [[classified information|classified military information]] related to [[Submarine warfare|undersea warfare]].&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
The term "agnotology" was first coined in a footnote in Proctor's 1995 book, ''The Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know About Cancer'': "Historians and philosophers of science have tended to treat ignorance as an ever-expanding vacuum into which knowledge is sucked – or even, as [[Johannes Kepler]] once put it, as the mother who must die for [[science]] to be born. Ignorance, though, is more complex than this. It has a distinct and changing political geography that is often an excellent indicator of the politics of knowledge. We need a political agnotology to complement our political epistemologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proctor |first=Robert |title=The Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know About Cancer |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1995 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proctor was quoted using the term to describe his research "only half jokingly", as "agnotology" in a 2001 interview about his [[lapidary]] work with the colorful rock [[agate]]. He connected the two seemingly unrelated topics by noting the lack of [[geology|geologic]] knowledge and study of agate since its first known description by [[Theophrastus]] in 300 BC, relative to the extensive research on other rocks and minerals such as [[diamond]]s, [[asbestos]], [[granite]], and [[coal]], all of which have much higher commercial value. He said agate was a "victim of scientific disinterest", the same "structured apathy" he called "the social construction of ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rps.psu.edu/0109/agateer.html |title=The Agateer |accessdate=2007-08-12 |work=Research Penn State|first=Nancy Marie |last=Brown|date=September 2001| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070811131237/http://www.rps.psu.edu/0109/agateer.html| archivedate= 11 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was later quoted as calling it "agnotology, the study of ignorance", in a 2003 ''[[The New York Times]]'' story on medical historians testifying as [[expert witness]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/14/arts/14HIST.html?ex=1371009600&amp;en=e10e0387e68ab30f&amp;ei=5007 |title=History for Hire in Industry Lawsuits|date=2003-06-14 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |author =Cohen, Patricia |work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=Mr. Proctor, who describes his specialty as "agnotology, the study of ignorance", argues that the tobacco industry has tried to give the impression that the hazards of cigarette smoking are still an open question even when the scientific evidence is indisputable. "The tobacco industry is famous for having seen itself as a manufacturer of two different products," he said, "tobacco and doubt".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proctor co-organized a pair of events with [[Londa Schiebinger]], his wife, who is also a science history professor: the first was a workshop at the [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 2003 titled "Agnatology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bshs.org.uk/agnatology-the-cultural-production-of-ignorance |website=The British Society for the History of Science |title=Agnatology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance |accessdate=2014-07-15 |quote=Science, Medicine, and Technology in Culture Pennsylvania University Presents a Workshop: ... Robert N. Proctor and Londa Schiebinger, co-organizers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later a conference at [[Stanford University]] in 2005 titled "Agnotology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance".&lt;ref name=2005conf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPST/AgnotologyConference.html |title= Agnotology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance|accessdate=2007-08-12 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political economy===

In 2004, [[Londa Schiebinger]]&lt;ref name="news-service.stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/october13/londa-1013.html |title=IRWG director hopes to create 'go to' center for gender studies |accessdate=2007-08-12 |date=2004-10-13 |work=Stanford News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;
gave a more precise definition of agnotology in a paper on 18th-century voyages of scientific discovery and gender relations, and contrasted it with [[epistemology]], the theory of knowledge, saying that the latter questions how we know while the former questions why we do not know: "Ignorance is often not merely the absence of knowledge but an outcome of cultural and political struggle".&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2004&gt;{{cite journal

Its use as a critical description of the political economy has been expanded upon by [[Michael Betancourt]] in a 2010 article titled "Immaterial Value and Scarcity in Digital Capitalism"&lt;ref name="Betancourt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=652 |title=CTheory |accessdate=2010-09-06 |quote="Immaterial Value and Scarcity in Digital Capitalism", CTheory, Theory Beyond the Codes: tbc002, Date Published: 6/10/2010, Arthur and Marilouise Kroker, Editors| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101005143051/http://ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=652| archivedate= 5 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded in the book ''The Critique of Digital Capitalism''.&lt;ref name="Betancourt2"&gt;{{cite book | last=Betancourt |first=Michael | authorlink = Michael Betancourt | title = [[The Critique of Digital Capitalism]]: An Analysis of the Political Economy of Digital Culture and Technology | publisher = [[Punctum Books]] | location = Brooklyn | year = 2016 | ISBN = 978-0692598443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis is focused on the housing bubble as well as the bubble economy of the period from 1980 to 2008. Betancourt argues that this political economy should be termed "agnotologic capitalism" because the systemic production and maintenance of ignorance is a major feature that enables the economy to function as it allows the creation of a "bubble economy".&lt;ref name="news-service.stanford.edu"/&gt;

Betancourt's argument is posed in relation to the idea of [[affective labor]]. He states that &lt;blockquote&gt;The creation of systemic unknowns where any potential "fact" is always already countered by an alternative of apparently equal weight and value renders engagement with the conditions of reality – the very situations affective labor seeks to assuage – contentious and a source of confusion, reflected by the inability of participants in bubbles to be aware of the imminent collapse until after it has happened. The biopolitical paradigm of distraction, what [Juan Martin] Prada calls "life to enjoy", can only be maintained if the underlying strictures remain hidden from view. If affective labor works to reduce alienation, agnotology works to eliminate the potential for dissent.&lt;ref name="Betancourt"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his view, the role of affective labor is to enable the continuation of the agnotologic effects that enable the maintenance of the capitalist status quo.

==Agnoiology==

A similar word from the same Greek roots, ''agnoiology'', meaning "the science or study of ignorance, which determines its quality and conditions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Agnoiology|volume=1|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the doctrine concerning those things of which we are necessarily ignorant"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |editor= Porter, Noah | publisher= G &amp; C. Merriam Co.| year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes a branch of philosophy studied by [[James Frederick Ferrier]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9002832/James-Frederick-Ferrier |title=James Frederick Ferrier |accessdate=2007-08-12 |format= |work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ainigmology ==
Anthropologist Glenn Stone points out that most of the examples of agnotology (such as work promoting tobacco use) do not actually create a lack of knowledge so much as they create confusion.  A more accurate term for such writing would be "ainigmology", from the root ''ainigma'' (as in "enigma"); in Greek this refers to riddles or to language that obscures the true meaning of a story.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Glenn Davis 2014 Biosecurity in the Age of Genetic Engineering. In '''[http://pages.wustl.edu/files/pages/imce/stone/stone_2014_bioinsecurity.pdf Bioinsecurity and Human Vulnerability]''', ed Nancy Chen and Lesley Sharp, pp. 71-86.  Santa Fe: SAR Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media influence ==

The availability of such large amounts of knowledge in this information age may not necessarily be producing a knowledgeable citizenry. Instead it may be allowing many people to cherry-pick information in blogs or news that reinforces their existing beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| title=Study: Americans choose media messages that agree with their views

| year=2009
| volume=36
| pages=426–448}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and to be distracted from new knowledge by repetitive or base entertainments. There is conflicting evidence on how television viewing affects intelligence as well as values formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| doi=10.1542/peds.2006-1307

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An emerging new scientific discipline that has connections to agnotology is [[cognitronics]]:
;cognitronics : aims (a) at explicating the distortions in the perception of the world caused by the information society and globalization and (b) at coping with these distortions in different fields. Cognitronics is studying and looking for the ways of improving cognitive mechanisms of processing information and developing emotional sphere of the personality - the ways aiming at compensating three mentioned shifts in the systems of values and, as an indirect consequence, for the ways of developing symbolic information processing skills of the learners, linguistic mechanisms, associative and reasoning abilities, broad mental outlook being important preconditions of successful work practically in every sphere of professional activity in information society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list

'''Arno Ros''' (born 18 December 1942 in [[Hamburg]]) is a German philosopher and Professor of Theoretical Philosophy at the [[Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg]] in [[Magdeburg]], [[Germany]].

== Biography ==

=== Studies and initial teaching positions ===
Ros studied [[Ibero-Romance]] languages, [[sociology]], [[literature]] and [[philosophy]] in [[Hamburg]], [[Madrid]] ([[Spain]]) and [[Coimbra]] ([[Portugal]]). He received his doctorate in 1971 for the dissertation  ''On the theory of literary narrative''. He earned his [[habilitation]] in [[Saarbrücken]] as an assistant of [[Kuno Lorenz]]. The title of his habilitation thesis was ''Philosophy as a methodological critique of meaning''. In subsequent years, Ros was a [[visiting professor]] in [[Hamburg]], [[Saarbrücken]] and [[Campinas]] ([[Brazil]]).

=== Professor at Magdeburg University ===

Since 1994 he is [[professor]] for Theoretical [[Philosophy]] at the [[Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg]]. His main focus is concentrated on systematic and historical problems of [[argumentation theory]] with special attention to the theory of concepts (the concept of concept) as well as systematic and historical questions of philosophy of [[biology]] and [[psychology]], with particular reference to the philosophical aspects of the [[mind-body problem|mind-matter problem]].

Among his students, he is best known and appreciated for his conceptually accurate [[argumentation]] and [[teaching]]. In his lectures he takes particular care to examine complicated problems by clearly distinguishing between their logical-methodological and historical components.

== Philosophy ==

===  Argumentation theory ===

Ros is known (also because of his activities as a former assistant of [[Kuno Lorenz]]) as an expert in [[argumentation theory]] and in this field he has researched the concepts of concept, of foundation, of explanation as well as of a typology of explanations (which are distinguished by the different types of causes that they provide). From 1989 to 1990, Ros published ''Foundation and Concept'', a three volume monograph on the concept of concept that spans the history of philosophy from its beginnings in ancient Greece to contemporary Analytical Philosophy.

=== Epistemology and the Task of Philosophy ===

The term 'concept' is understood by Ros along lines suggested by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later work, that is, as a linguistic classificatory ability or habit. The epistemological starting point is that we as subjects can only acquire knowledge about parts of the world by classifying objects (entities), that is, by making use of our classificatory abilities. The problem lies in the fact that our classificatory abilities may be learned, dependent on culture, or biologically conditioned, whereby the possibility of objective justification can be called into question. From this arises the task of philosophy, which, unlike the sciences, does not use or apply our classificatory abilities to interpret reality, but rather reflects upon these very conceptual abilities, that is, investigates whether they are meaningful or  reasonable.

=== Philosophy of mind ===

As an argumentation theorist, Ros especially emphasizes that within the philosophy of mind it is critical to first of all specify the problem as exactly as possible. Physical processes have to be distinguished from biological processes because the latter, in contrast to the former, when related to the activities of an organism, are purposeful and are meant as a response to a stimulus. From the concept of organism Ros progresses to the concept of the agent or acting subject, and from this to the concept of person, which is characterized by the criterion of possessing psychological phenomena. In the case of humans, an additional stage is reached, because they are also able to guide themselves by rules.

In ''Matter and Spirit'' (2005), Ros presented a thorough  analysis of the mind-matter problem. In 2008, he published the essay "Mental Causation and Mereological Explanations", in which he tries to solve the problem of mental causation by means of mereological explanations.

In addition, he has recently published the following papers on the philosophy of mind:
   
* 1996: "Philosophical aspects of mind-matter problem" (inaugural lecture at the Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg on 26 June 1996)
* 1996: "Observations on the relationship between neurophysiology and psychology"
* 1997: "Reduction, identity and abstraction. Comments on the discussion about the thesis of the identity of physical and psychological phenomena ..."
* 1998: "Comments on the mind-matter problem: What it is about, and how it can be solved."
* 2007: "Freedom of will, agency and chance"
* 2007: "Immediate selfconsciousness: What it is and how it may have evolved."

Ros speaks in the philosophy of mind expressly of psychological (German, ''psychische'') phenomena instead of mental (German, ''mentale'') or spiritual (German, ''geistige'') states (as is common in the current debate). For him, only higher cognitive functions (such as problem solving, use of abstract concepts, etc.) qualify as mental or spiritual, while psychological phenomena must include states such as temper tantrums. Ros therefore avoids using the terms mental and spiritual. After all, the German word ''Geist'' is merely a corresponding term for the Greek concept of ''psyche''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4705">'''Beatrice M. L. de Gelder''' (born 1944) is a cognitive [[neuroscientist]] and [[neuropsychologist]]. She is [[professor]] of Cognitive Neuroscience and director of the Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Laboratory at the [[Tilburg University]] (Netherlands), and  was senior scientist at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Harvard Medical School, [[Boston]] (USA). She joined the Department of Cognitive Neuroscince at Maastricht University in 2012. Her research interests include  behavioral and neural emotion processing from facial and bodily expressions, multisensory perception and interaction between auditory and visual processes, and nonconscious perception in neurological patients.  She is author of numerous books and publications. She was a Fellow of the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study, and an elected member of the International Neuropsychological Symposia since 1999. She is currently the [[Editor-in-Chief]] of the journal ''Frontiers in Emotion Science'' and  associate editor for ''Frontiers in Perception Science''.

== Education ==
De Gelder holds degrees in both [[Philosophy]] (1967) and [[Psychology]] (1969), and received her [[PhD]] in philosophy 1972 from the University of [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Leuven]], Belgium. She began her academic career teaching Philosophy of Science, first in [[Leiden]] (1973–79) and then in [[Tilburg]] (1980–92). In the mid nineties de Gelder began her work in the field of Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience.

== Areas of research ==
De Gelder has innovated in a number of research areas and has contributed significantly to new developments. 
* Face recognition: De Gelder has shown that [[brain damage]] in one area does not simply lead to loss of a specific function but that intact brain areas can actively interfere with normal function (inverted faces are better recognized than upright ones). This resulted in a new model of face recognition. For this research and as a service to the community she recruited persons with face recognition difficulties through a dedicated website [http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/gezichtsblindheid www.tilburguniversity.edu/gezichtsblindheid]  
* Multisensory perception of emotion integrating facial expressions speech prosody: This work was the first to investigate the perceptual combination of facial expression with emotional voice signals and measure [[EEG]]. Her team published evidence for emotional face/voice integration in [[autism]] and in [[schizophrenia]]. 
* Nonconscious emotion perception in [[hemianopia]] patients (affective [[blindsight]]): De Gelder discovered that without V1 cortex, there is still recognition of facial expressions albeit unconsciously, an entirely novel finding that has since then been replicated in different labs.
* Emotional body expressions: In 2003 de Gelder published the first neuroscientific study on emotional body perception. Her team was the first to combine methods of psychology and neuropsychology with novel neuroscience tools – like [[EEG]] and [[fMRI]] – in research on bodily expressions and have put this topic on the agenda for a new generation of affective scientists. 
* Scene context:  De Gelder initiated a new research line on the study on emotional scene gist and its effect on face recognition.  This opened new perspectives for investigating emotion deficits in [[schizophrenia]] and [[autism]]. 
* Social interaction: De Gelder  explored social interaction using realistic stimuli and recently published the first fMRI study using realistic interaction videos of interpersonal threat situations.

'''Božena Komárková''' (28 January 1903 – 27 January 1997) was Czech [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]].

Most of her work remained unknown both in the Czech Republic and abroad till the [[Velvet Revolution]], since [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Communism|communist]] [[regime]]s persecuted her and tried to isolate her from society.

In 2003 a selection of Komárková's essays was published in English under the title ''Human Rights and the Rise of the Secular Age''.

The '''burden of proof''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: '''''onus probandi''''', shortened from ''Onus probandi incumbit ei qui dicit, non ei qui negat'') is the obligation on a party in a dispute to provide sufficient [[warrant (philosophy)|warrant]] for their position.

==Holder of the burden==
When two parties are in a discussion and one makes a claim &lt;!-- DO NOT ADD THE WORD "positive" HERE. There is no logical distinction between positive and negative claims --&gt;that the other disputes, the one who makes the claim typically has a ''burden of proof'' to justify or substantiate that claim especially when it challenges a perceived status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cargile |first=James | date=January 1997 |title=On the burden of proof |journal=[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |volume=72 |issue=279 |pages=59–83 |doi=10.1017/s0031819100056655}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also stated in [[Hitchens's razor]]. Carl Sagan proposed a related criterion, the [[Sagan standard]], "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Marc Kaufman, ''First Contact: Scientific Breakthroughs in the Hunt for Life Beyond Earth'', Simon and Schuster, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

While certain kinds of arguments, such as logical [[syllogism]]s, require [[Mathematical proof|mathematical]] or strictly [[Formal proof|logical proof]]s, the standard for [[evidence]] to meet the burden of proof is usually determined by context and community standards and conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leite |first=Adam |year=2005 |title=A localist solution to the regress of justification |journal=[[Australasian Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=395–421 [p. 418] |doi=10.1080/00048400500191974 |quote=[t]he point of articulating reasons in defense of one's belief is to establish that one is justified in believing as one does. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leite |first=Adam |year=2005 |title=A localist solution to the regress of justification |journal=[[Australasian Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=395–421 [p. 403] |doi=10.1080/00048400500191974 |quote=justificatory conversation...[is]...characterized by a person's sincere attempt to vindicate his or her entitlement to a belief by providing adequate reasons in its defense and responding to objections. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical debate can devolve into arguing about who has the burden of proof about a particular claim. This has been described as "burden tennis" or the "onus game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dennett |first=Daniel C. |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |date=July 1988 |title=Review of ''Psychosemantics'' by Jerry Fodor |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=85 |issue=7 |pages=384–389 (389) |doi=10.2307/2026956 |url=http://cogprints.org/253/1/fodor.htm |jstor=2026956 |quote=Fodor is too wise to think his series of arguments can flat disprove the claims of the opposition, so time and again he resorts to claims about shifting the burden of proof, begging the question, outsmarting by embracing the conclusions of reductios, and other exploitations of the rules of the game. The book is a tireless exercise of that philosopher's pasttime, burden-tennis. Burden, burden, who has the burden of proof now? Fodor mostly plays solitaire burden-tennis, against an imaginary opponent often personified as Granny or Aunty, which permits him to express the opposition view in terms that suit his rebuttal, without having to address the issue of whether this is a sympathetic rendering of any real opponent's claims.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rodych |first=Victor |date=1996 |origyear=1986 |chapter=Wittgenstein's inversion of Gödel's theorem |editor1-last=Shanker |editor1-first=Stuart |editor1-link=Stuart Shanker |editor2-last=Kilfoyle |editor2-first=David |title=Ludwig Wittgenstein: critical assessments |volume=2.

==Shifting the burden of proof==
One way in which one would attempt to shift the burden of proof is by committing a logical fallacy known as the [[argument from ignorance]]. It occurs when either a [[proposition]] is assumed to be true because it has not yet been proved false or a proposition is assumed to be false because it has not yet been proved true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Argumentum ad Ignorantiam|url= http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/ignorance.html|work= Philosophy 103: Introduction to Logic|publisher= [[Lander University]]|year= 2004|accessdate= 2009-04-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090430170946/http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/ignorance.html| archivedate= 30 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | first=Bradley | last=Dowden | encyclopedia=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] | title=Appeal to ignorance | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#AppealtoIgnorance | accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proving a negative==

A [[affirmative and negative|negative]] claim is a colloquialism for an affirmative claim that asserts the non-existence or exclusion of something.&lt;ref name="Hales"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hales |first=Steven D. |date=Summer 2005 |title=Thinking tools: You ''can'' prove a negative |journal=[[Think (journal)|Think]] |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=109–112 |doi=10.1017/S1477175600001287 |url=http://departments.bloomu.edu/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/proveanegative.pdf |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saying "You cannot prove a negative" has been called pseudologic because there are many proofs that substantiate negative claims in mathematics, science, and economics including [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}. There can be multiple claims within a [[debate]]. Nevertheless, it has been said whoever makes a claim carries the burden of proof regardless of positive or negative content in the claim.

A negative claim may or may not exist as a counterpoint to a previous claim. A [[proof of impossibility]] or an [[evidence of absence]] argument are typical methods to fulfill the burden of proof for a negative claim.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Damer |first=T.

==Application==
===In public discourse===

Burden of proof is also an important concept in the [[public sphere|public arena of ideas]]. Once participants in discourse establish common [[Presupposition|assumption]]s, the mechanism of burden of proof helps to ensure that all parties contribute productively, using relevant arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldman |first=Alvin |year=1994 |title=Argumentation and social epistemology |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=27–49 |jstor=2940949 |doi=10.2307/2940949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=van Eemeren |first=Frans H. |authorlink1=Frans H. van Eemeren  |last2=Grootendorst |first2=Rob |authorlink2=Rob Grootendorst |year=2004 |title=A systematic theory of argumentation |location=Cambridge, UK; New York |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0521830753 |page=60 |quote=[t]here is no point in venturing to resolve a difference of opinion through an argumentative exchange of views if there is no mutual commitment to a common starting point. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brandom |first=Robert |year=1994 |title=Making it explicit |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |page=222 |isbn=067454319X |quote=[t]here are sentence types that would require a great deal of work for one to get into a position to challenge, such as 'Red is a color,' 'There have been black dogs,' 'Lighting frequently precedes thunder,' and similar commonplaces. These are treated as 'free moves' by members of our speech community—they are available to just about anyone any time to use as premises, to assert unchallenged. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adler |first=Jonathan E. |year=2002 |title=Belief's own ethics |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |pages=164–167 |isbn=0262011921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In law===
{{main|Burden of proof (law)}}
The legal burden of proof ({{lang-la|onus probandi}}) is the obligation of a [[party (law)|party]] in a [[trial]] to produce the [[evidence]] that will prove the claims they have made against the other party. In a legal dispute, one party is initially presumed to be correct and gets the benefit of the doubt, while the other side bears the burden of proof. When a party bearing the burden of proof meets their burden, the burden of proof switches to the other side. Burdens may be of different kinds for each party, in different phases of litigation. The [[Prima facie|burden of production]] is a minimal burden to produce at least enough evidence for the [[trier of fact]] to ''consider'' a disputed claim.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], Guyora Binder, {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16–17}} After litigants have met the burden of production and their claim is being considered by a trier of fact, they have the burden of persuasion, that enough evidence has been presented to persuade the trier of fact that their side is correct. There are different ''standards'' of persuasiveness ranging from a [[preponderance of the evidence]], where there is just enough evidence to tip the balance, to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as in United States criminal courts.&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

The burden of proof is usually on the person who brings a claim in a dispute. It is often associated with the Latin [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] ''semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit'', a translation of which in this context is: "the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges."&lt;ref&gt;Transnational principle of law: [http://www.trans-lex.org/966000 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The party that does not carry the burden of proof carries the benefit of assumption of being correct, they are presumed to be correct, until the burden shifts after presentation of evidence by the party bringing the action. An example is in an American [[criminal case]], where there is a [[presumption of innocence]] by the [[defendant]]. Fulfilling the burden of proof effectively captures the benefit of assumption, passing the burden of proof off to another party.

===In statistics===
{{main|Null hypothesis}}
In [[inferential statistics]], the null hypothesis is a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena, or no association among groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Everitt | first = Brian | title = The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 0521593468 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting or disproving the null [[hypothesis]]—and thus concluding that there are grounds for believing that there ''is'' a relationship between two phenomena (e.g. that a potential treatment has a measurable effect)—is a central task in the modern practice of science; the field of statistics gives precise criteria for rejecting a null hypothesis{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

The null hypothesis is generally assumed to be true until evidence indicates otherwise.  In statistics, it is often denoted '''''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''' (read “H-nought”, "H-null", "H-oh", or "H-zero").

The concept of a null hypothesis is used differently in two approaches to statistical inference. In the significance testing approach of [[Ronald Fisher]], a null hypothesis is rejected if the observed data are [[Statistical significance|significantly]] unlikely to have occurred if the null hypothesis were true. In this case the null hypothesis is rejected and an [[alternative hypothesis]] is accepted in its place. If the data are consistent with the null hypothesis, then the null hypothesis is not rejected. In neither case is the null hypothesis or its alternative proven; the null hypothesis is tested with data and a decision is made based on how likely or unlikely the data are. This is analogous to the legal principle of [[presumption of innocence]], in which a suspect or defendant is assumed to be innocent (null is not rejected) until proven guilty (null is rejected) beyond a reasonable doubt (to a statistically significant degree).

In the [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]] approach of [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Egon Pearson]], a null hypothesis is contrasted with an alternative hypothesis and the two hypotheses are distinguished on the basis of data, with certain error rates.

Proponents of each approach criticize the other approach. Nowadays, though, a hybrid approach is widely practiced and presented in textbooks. The hybrid is in turn criticized as incorrect and incoherent—for details, see [[Statistical hypothesis testing]].

Statistical inference can be done without a null hypothesis, by specifying a [[statistical model]] corresponding to each candidate hypothesis and using [[model selection]] techniques to choose the most appropriate model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Burnham |first=K. P. |last2=Anderson |first2=D. R. |year=2002 |title=Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach |edition=2nd |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=0-387-95364-7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  (The most common selection techniques are based on either [[Akaike information criterion]] or [[Bayes factor]].)

==Example==
Internet personality [[Matt Dillahunty]] gives the example of a large jar full of gumballs to illustrate the burden of proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Atheist Experience #808 with Matt Dillahunty and Jeff Dee |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek4M1trIYr8 |network=channelAustin 16 |series=The Atheist Experience |date=7 April 2013 |number=808}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Matt Dillahunty |year=2013 |title =Does God exist? |medium=Debate |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKrKK6Kcnis |location=[[Texas State University]] |accessdate =2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of whole gumballs in the jar is either [[Parity (mathematics)|even or odd]], but the degree of personal acceptance or rejection of claims about that characteristic may vary. We can choose to consider two claims about the situation, given as:
# The number of gumballs is even.
# The number of gumballs is odd.
Either claim could be explored separately; however, both claims tautologically take bearing on the same question. [[parity (mathematics)|Odd]] in this case means "not even" and could be described as a negative claim. Before we have any information about the number of gumballs, we have no means of checking either of the two claims. When we have no evidence to resolve the proposition, we may suspend judgment. From a cognitive sense, when no personal preference toward opposing claims exists, one may be either skeptical about both claims or ambivalent about both claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Song |first1=Hyunjin |last2=Ewoldsen |first2=David R. |date=February 2015 |title=Metacognitive model of ambivalence: the role of multiple beliefs and metacognitions in creating attitude ambivalence |journal=[[Communication Theory (journal)|Communication Theory]] |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=23–45 |doi=10.1111/comt.12050}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a dispute, the burden of proof falls onto the challenger of the status quo from the perspective of any given social narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=van Eemeren |first1=Frans H. |authorlink1=Frans H. van Eemeren |last2=Houtlosser |first2=Peter |date=2003 |chapter=A pragmatic view of the burden of proof |editor1-last=van Eemeren |editor1-first=Frans H. |editor1-link=Frans H. van Eemeren |editor2-last=Blair |editor2-first=J.

'''''Chan''''' ({{zh|t=[[Wiktionary:禪|禪]]|s=[[Wiktionary:禅|禅]]|p=Chán}}; {{abbr|abbr.|abbreviation}} of {{zh|p=chánnà|t=[[Wiktionary:禪那|禪那]]}}), from [[Sanskrit]] ''[[dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]''{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=xvii}} (meaning "[[meditation]]" or "meditative state"{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=24}}), is a Chinese school of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] [[Buddhism]]. It developed in China from the 6th century [[Common Era|CE]] onwards, becoming dominant during the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]]. After the Yuan, Chan more or less fused with [[Pure Land Buddhism]].

Chan spread south to [[Vietnam]] as [[Vietnamese Thiền|Thiền]] and north to [[Korea]] as [[Korean Seon|Seon]], and, in the 13th century, east to [[Japan]] as [[Zen]].

==History==
{{See also| Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}
The historical records required for a complete, accurate account of early Chan history no longer exist.&lt;ref name="Cleary 2005"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Cleary|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Periodisation===
The history of Chan in China can be divided into several periods. Chan as we know it today is the result of a long history, with many changes and contingent factors. Each period had different types of Chan, some of which have remained influential, while others vanished.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2000}}

Ferguson distinguishes three periods from the fifth century into the thirteenth century:
# The Legendary period, from Bodhidharma in the late 5th century to the end of the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] around 765 CE, in the middle of the [[Tang Dynasty]]. &lt;br&gt; Little written information is left from this period.{{sfn|Ferguson|2000|p=3}} The [[lineage (Buddhism)#Six patriarchs|Six Patriarchs]], including [[Bodhidharma]] and [[Huineng]], were among the first teachers of Chan. The split occurred between the Northern and the Southern School.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}
# The Classical period, from the end of the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] around 765 CE to the beginning of the [[Song Dynasty]] around 950 CE.{{sfn|Ferguson|2000|p=3}} &lt;br&gt; This is the time of the great masters of Chan, such as [[Mazu Daoyi]] and [[Linji Yixuan]], and the creation of the ''yulu'' (語錄) genre, the recordings of the sayings and teachings of these great masters.
# The Literary period, from around 950 to 1250,{{sfn|Ferguson|2000|p=3}} which spans the era of the Song Dynasty (960–1279). &lt;br&gt; Monks compiled collections of ''[[koan|gongan]]'', sayings and deeds by the famous masters, appended with poetry and commentary. This genre reflects the influence of ''literati'' on the development of Chan. People from this time idealized the previous period as the "golden age" of Chan, producing the literature that portrays the supposed spontaneity of the celebrated masters.

Although McRae has reservations about the division of Chan's history in phases or periods,{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=11–15}} he nevertheless distinguishes four phases in the history of Chan:{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=11–21}}
# Proto-Chan (c. 500–600) &lt;br&gt; Chan developed in multiple locations in northern China. It was based on the practice of ''dhyana'', and is connected to the figures of Bodhiharma and [[Huike]]. Its principal text is the ''[[Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices|Two Entrances and Four Practices]]'', attributed to Bodhidharma.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=13, 15–17}}
# Early Chan (c. 600–900) &lt;br&gt; Chan took its first clear contours. Prime figures are the fifth patriarch [[Daman Hongren]] (601–674), his dharma-heir [[Yuquan Shenxiu]] (606?–706), the sixth patriarch [[Huineng]] (638–713), antagonist of the quintessential ''[[Platform Sutra]]'', and [[Shenhui]] (670–762), whose propaganda elevated Huineng to the status of sixth patriarch. Main factions were the [[East Mountain Teaching|Northern School, Southern School and Oxhead School]].{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=13, 17–18}}
# Middle Chan (c. 750–1000) &lt;br&gt; [[Iconoclast]]ic masters became to prominence. Prime figures are [[Mazu Daoyi]] (709–788), [[Shitou Xiqian]] (710–790), [[Linji Yixuan]] (d. 867), and [[Xuefeng Yicun]] (822–908). Main factions were the [[Hongzhou school]] and the Hubei faction{{refn|group=note|McRae gives no further information on this "Hubei faction". It may be the continuation of Shenxiu's "Northern School". See Nadeau 2012 p.89.{{sfn|Nadeau|2012|p=89}} In Hebei the Linji branch of Chan arose.{{sfn|Yanagida|2009|p=63}}}} An important text is the ''[[Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall]]'' (952), which gives a great amount of "encounter stories", and the well-known genealogy of the Chan school.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=13, 18–19}}
# Song-Dynasty Chan (c. 950–1300) &lt;br&gt; Chan took its definitive shape, including the picture of the "golden age" of the Chan of the Tang Dynasty, and the use of koans for individual study and meditation. Key figures were [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089–1163), who introduced the [[Hua Tou]] practice, and [[Hongzhi Zhengjue]] (1091–1157), who emphasized ''[[shikantaza]]''. Main factions were the [[Linji school]] and the [[Caodong school]]. Classic koan collections, such as the ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'', were assembled{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=13, 19–21}} and reflect the influence of the literati on the development of Chan.{{sfn|Gimello|1994}}{{sfn|Welter|2000}} In this phase Chan is transported to Japan, and exerts a great influence on Korean Seon via [[Jinul]].

Neither Ferguson nor McRae gives a periodisation for Chinese Chan after the Song Dynasty, though McRae mentions "at least a post-classical phase or perhaps multiple phases".{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=13}}{{refn|group=note|During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and the [[Qing]] Dynasty (1644–1912) Chan was part of a larger, syncretic Buddhist culture. A final phase may be distinguished from the 19th century onward, when Western imperialism had a growing influence in Southeast Asia, including China. A side effect of this imperial influence was the modernisation of Asian religions, adapting them to Western ideas and rhetorical strategies.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}}

{{See also|Han Dynasty|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Six Dynasties}}

====Signification of Buddhism and Taoist influences====
When Buddhism came to China, it was adapted to the Chinese culture and understanding. Theories about the influence of other schools in the evolution of Chan vary widely and heavily reliant upon speculative [[correlation]] rather than on written records or histories. Some scholars have argued that Chan developed from the interaction between Mahāyāna Buddhism and [[Taoism]],{{sfn|Maspero|1981|p=46}}{{sfn|Grigg|1999}} while others insist that Chan has roots in [[yogic]] practices, specifically [[kammaṭṭhāna|''{{IAST|kammaṭṭhāna}}'']], the consideration of objects, and [[kasina|''{{IAST|kasiṇa}}'']], total fixation of the mind.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005-A|pp=8–9, 68, 166–167, 169–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other conflicting theories exist.

Buddhism was exposed to [[Confucianism|Confucian]]{{sfn|Brown Holt|1995}} and [[Taoism|Taoist]]{{sfn|Goddard |2007|p=10}}{{sfn|Fowler|2005|p=79}} influences when it came to China. Goddard quotes [[D.T. Suzuki]],{{refn|group=note|Godard does not provide a source for this quote}} calling Chan a "natural evolution of Buddhism under Taoist conditions".{{sfn|Goddard|2007|p=11}} Buddhism was first identified to be "a barbarian variant of Taoism", and Taoist terminology was used to express Buddhist doctrines in the oldest translations of Buddhist texts,{{sfn|Fowler|2005|p=79}} a practice termed "matching the concepts".{{sfn|Oh|2000}}
{{quote|Judging from the reception by the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] of the Hinayana works and from the early commentaries, it appears that Buddhism was being perceived and digested through the medium of religious Daoism (Taoism). Buddha was seen as a foreign immortal who had achieved some form of Daoist nondeath. The Buddhists' mindfulness of the breath was regarded as an extension of Daoist breathing exercises.{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}}}}

The first Buddhist recruits in China were Taoists.{{sfn|Fowler|2005|p=79}} They developed high esteem for the newly introduced Buddhist meditational techniques,{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=65}} and blended them with [[Neidan|Taoist meditation]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=64}} Representatives of early Chinese Buddhism like [[Sengzhao]] and [[Tao Sheng]] were deeply influenced by the Taoist keystone works of [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|pp=70&amp;74}} Against this background, especially the Taoist concept of ''[[Taoism#Naturalness|naturalness]]'' was inherited by the early Chan disciples:{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=167}} they equated – to some extent – the ineffable [[Tao]] and [[Buddha-nature]],{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A |p=168}} and thus, rather than feeling bound to the abstract "wisdom of the sūtras", emphasized Buddha-nature to be found in "everyday" human life, just as the Tao.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=168}}

Neo-Taoist concepts were taken over in Chinese Buddhism as well.{{sfn|Oh|2000}} Concepts such as ''T'i-yung'' (體用 Essence and Function) and ''Li-shih'' (理事 Noumenon and Phenomenon, or Principle and Practice) were first taken over by [[Huayan school|Hua-yen]] Buddhism,{{sfn|Oh|2000}} which consequently influenced Chan deeply.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=45–49}} On the other hand, Taoists at first misunderstood [[sunyata]] to be akin to the Taoist [[wu wei|non-being]].{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown|p=8}}

The emerging Chinese Buddhism nevertheless had to compete with Taoism and Confucianism:{{sfn|Brown Holt|1995}}
{{quote|Because Buddhism was a foreign influence, however, and everything "barbarian" was suspect, certain Chinese critics were jolted out of complacency by the spread of the dharma [...] In the first four centuries of the Christian Era, this barbarian influence was infiltrating China just when it was least politically stable and more vulnerable to sedition. As the philosophy and practice infiltrated society, many traditionalists banded together to stop the foreign influence, not so much out of intolerance (an attitude flatly rejected by both Taoism and Confucianism), but because they felt that the Chinese world view was being turned upside down.{{sfn|Brown Holt|1995}}}}

====Divisions of training====
When Buddhism came to China, there were three divisions of training:
# The training in virtue and discipline in the precepts (Skt. ''[[śīla]]''),
# The training in mind through meditation (Skt. ''dhyāna'') to attain deep states of meditation (Skt. ''[[samādhi (Buddhism)|samādhi]]''), and
# The training in the recorded teachings (Skt. ''Dharma'').

It was in this context that Buddhism entered into Chinese culture. Three types of teachers with expertise in each training practice developed:
# [[Vinaya]] masters specialized in all the rules of discipline for monks and nuns,
# Dhyāna masters specialized in the practice of meditation, and
# [[Dharma]] masters specialized in mastery of the Buddhist texts.

Monasteries and practice centers were created that tended to focus on either the Vinaya and training of monks or the teachings focused on one scripture or a small group of texts. Dhyāna (''Chan'') masters tended to practice in solitary hermitages, or to be associated with vinaya training monasteries or the dharma teaching centers. The later naming of the Zen school has its origins in this view of the threefold division of training.

McRae goes so far as to say:
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;one important feature must not be overlooked: Chan was not nearly as separate from these other types of Buddhist activities as one might think [...] [T]he monasteries of which Chan monks became abbots were comprehensive institutions, "public monasteries" that supported various types of Buddhist activities other than Chan-style meditation. The reader should bear this point in mind: In contrast to the independent denominations of Soto and Rinzai that emerged (largely by government fiat) in seventeenth-century Japan, ''there was never any such thing as an institutionally separate Chan "school" at any time in Chinese Buddhist history'' (emphasis McRae).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McRae|2003|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Mahākāśyapa and the Flower Sermon====
&lt;!-- Removed image - Fit Problem - (see talk): [[File:Mahakasyapa.jpg|left|100px]] --&gt;
The Chan tradition ascribes the origins of Chan in India to the [[Flower Sermon]], the earliest source for which comes from the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005-A}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that [[Gautama Buddha]] gathered his disciples one day for a [[Dharma talk]]. When they gathered together, the Buddha was completely silent and some speculated that perhaps the Buddha was tired or ill. The Buddha silently held up and twirled a flower and his eyes twinkled; several of his disciples tried to interpret what this meant, though none of them were correct. One of the Buddha's disciples, [[Mahākāśyapa]], gazed at the flower and broke into laugher. The Buddha then acknowledged Mahākāśyapa's insight by saying the following:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
{{quote|I possess the true Dharma eye, the marvelous mind of Nirvāṇa, the true form of the formless, the subtle Dharma gate that does not rest on words or letters but is a special transmission outside of the scriptures. This I entrust to Mahākāśyapa.}}

====First six patriarchs (c. 500 &amp;ndash; early 8th century)====
{{Main article|Lineage (Buddhism)}}
Traditionally the origin of Chan in China is credited to the Indian monk Bodhidharma. Only scarce historical information is available about him, but his hagiography developed when the Chan tradition grew stronger and gained prominence in the early 8th century. By this time a lineage of the six ancestral founders of Chan in China was developed.&lt;ref name="McRae 2003"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McRae|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 8th century, under the influence of Huineng's student [[Shenhui]], the traditional form of this lineage had been established:&lt;ref name="McRae 2003"/&gt;
# [[Bodhidharma]] ({{lang|zh|達摩}}) c. 440 – c. 528
# [[Dazu Huike]] ({{lang|zh|慧可}}) 487–593
# [[Sengcan]] ({{lang|zh|僧燦}}) ?–606
# [[Dayi Daoxin]] ({{lang|zh|道信}}) 580–651
# [[Daman Hongren]] ({{lang|zh|弘忍}}) 601–674
# [[Huineng]] ({{lang|zh|惠能}}) 638–713

In later writings this lineage was extended to include 28 Indian patriarchs. In the ''[[Song of Enlightenment]]'' (證道歌 ''Zhèngdào gē'') of [[Yongjia Xuanjue]] (永嘉玄覺, 665–713), one of the chief disciples of [[Huineng|Huìnéng]], it is written that Bodhidharma was the 28th patriarch in a line of descent from Mahākāśyapa, a disciple of [[Gautama Buddha|Śākyamuni Buddha]], and the first patriarch of Chan Buddhism.{{sfn|Chang|1967}}
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Mahākāśyapa was the first, leading the line of transmission;
Twenty-eight Fathers followed him in the West;
The Lamp was then brought over the sea to this country;
And Bodhidharma became the First Father here:
His mantle, as we all know, passed over six Fathers,
And by them many minds came to see the Light.{{sfn|Suzuki|1935}}&lt;/poem&gt;}}

====Lankavatara Sutra====
In its beginnings in China, Chan primarily referred to the [[Mahāyāna sūtras]] and especially to the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Yampolski|2003-B|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, early masters of the Chan tradition were referred to as "Laṅkāvatāra masters". As the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' teaches the doctrine of the [[Ekayāna]] "One Vehicle", the early Chan school was sometimes referred to as the "One Vehicle School".{{sfn|Yampolski|1967|29, note 87}} In other early texts, the school that would later become known as Chan is sometimes even referred to as simply the "Laṅkāvatāra school" (Ch. 楞伽宗, ''Léngqié Zōng'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts recording the history of this early period are to be found in the ''[[Lengqie shizi ji|Records of the Laṅkāvatāra Masters]]'' ({{zh|t=楞伽師資記}}'').

====Bodhidharma====
{{Main article|Bodhidharma}}
[[Image:Bodhidharma.and.Huike-Sesshu.Toyo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bodhidharma with Dazu Huike. Painting by [[Sesshū Tōyō]], 15th century.]]
The establishment of Chan in China is traditionally credited to the Buddhist monk [[Bodhidharma]], who is recorded as having come to China during the time of [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] to teach a "special transmission outside scriptures" which "did not stand upon words".

Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend.&lt;ref name="McRae 2003"/&gt; There are three principal sources for Bodhidharma's biography:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005-A|pp=85–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang'' by Yáng Xuànzhī's (楊衒之, 547), Tan Lin's preface to the ''[[Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices]]'' (6th century CE), and [[Dayi Daoxin]]'s ''Further Biographies of Eminent Monks'' (7th century CE).

These sources vary in their account of Bodhidharma being either "from Persia" (547 CE), "a Brahman monk from South India" (645 CE), "the third son of a Brahman king of South India" (c. 715 CE).&lt;ref name="McRae 2003"/&gt; Some traditions specifically describe Bodhidharma to be the third son of a [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava king]] from [[Kanchipuram]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.purple.dti.ne.jp/kambe/BodhiDharma-IDS.pdf Tstuomu Kambe: Bodhidharma (around 440? - 528?). A collection of stories from Chinese literature]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Zvelebil|1987|p=125–126}}

The ''Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices'' written by Tan Lin (曇林; 506–574), contains teachings which are attributed to Bodhidharma. The text is known from the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]]. The two entrances to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] are the entrance of principle and the entrance of practice:
{{quote|The entrance of principle is to become enlightened to the Truth on the basis of the teaching. One must have a profound [[faith in Buddhism|faith]] in the fact that one and the same True Nature is possessed by all sentient beings, both ordinary and enlightened, and that this True Nature is only covered up and made imperceptible [in the case of ordinary people] by [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|false sense impressions]]".&lt;ref name="McRae 2003 29"/&gt;}}

{{quote|The entrance of practice includes the following four increments:
# Practice of the retribution of enmity: to accept all suffering as the fruition of past transgressions, without enmity or complaint
# Practice of the acceptance of circumstances: to remain unmoved even by good fortune, recognizing it as evanescent
# Practice of the absence of craving: to be without craving, which is the source of all suffering
# Practice of accordance with the Dharma: to eradicate wrong thoughts and practice the six perfections, without having any "practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McRae|2003|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This text was used and studied by Huike and his students. The True Nature refers to the [[Buddha-nature]].&lt;ref name="McRae 2003 29"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McRae|2003|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Huike====
Bodhidharma settled in [[Northern Wei]] China. Shortly before his death, Bodhidharma appointed his disciple Dazu Huike to succeed him, making Huike the first Chinese-born ancestral founder and the second ancestral founder of Chan in China. Bodhidharma is said to have passed three items to Huike as a sign of transmission of the Dharma: a robe, a bowl, and a copy of the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra''. The transmission then passed to the second ancestral founder Dazu Huike, the third Sengcan, the fourth ancestral founder Dayi Daoxin, and the fifth ancestral founder [[Daman Hongren]].

===Early Chan in Tang China (c. 600–900)===

====East Mountain Teachings====
The period of Dayi Daoxin (580–651) and Daman Hongren ({{lang|zh|弘忍}} 601–674) came to be called the [[East Mountain Teaching]] due to the location of the residence of Daman Hongren in [[Huangmei County]], modern [[Anhui]]. The term was used by [[Yuquan Shenxiu]], the most important successor to Hongren.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McRae|2003|pp=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The East Mountain community was a specialized meditation training centre. Hongren was a plain meditation teacher, who taught students of "various religious interests", including "practitioners of the Lotus Sutra, students of Madhyamaka philosophy, or specialists in the monastic regulations of Buddhist [[Vinaya]]".&lt;ref name="McRae 2003 34"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McRae|2003|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of a community in one location was a change from the wandering lives of Bodhiharma and Huike and their followers.&lt;ref name="McRae 2003 34"/&gt; It fitted better into the Chinese society, which highly valued community-oriented behaviour, instead of solitary practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kasulis|2003|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yuquan Shenxiu====
Yuquan Shenxiu (神秀, 606?–706) was the most important successor to Hongren. In 701 he was invited to the Imperial Court by Zhou Empress [[Wu Zetian]], who paid him due imperial reverence. The first lineage documents were produced in this period:
{{quote|[T]he genealogical presentation of the Chan transmission was first recorded on paper in the early years of metropolitan Chan activity. The earliest recorded instance of this was in the epitaph for a certain Faru, a student of Hongren's who died in 689, and by the second decade of the 8th century, the later followers of Hongren had produced two separate texts describing the transmission from Bodhidharma to Shenxiu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McRae|2003|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The transition from the East Mountain to the two capitals changed the character of Chan:
{{quote|[I]t was only when Hongren's successors moved into the environment of the two capitals, with its literate society and incomparably larger urban scale, that well-written texts were required for disseminating the teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McRae|2003|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Southern School – Huineng and Shenhui====
[[File:Huineng-tearing-sutras.svg|thumb|left|100px|Huineng tearing sutras]]
{{See also|Subitism}}
According to tradition, the sixth and last ancestral founder, [[Huineng]] (惠能; 638–713), was one of the giants of Chan history, and all surviving schools regard him as their ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wuys.com/news/Article_Show.asp?ArticleID=1276 禅宗研究一百年] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916101251/http://www.wuys.com/news/Article_Show.asp?ArticleID=1276 |date=2013-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatic story of Huineng's life tells that there was a controversy over his claim to the title of patriarch. After being chosen by Hongren, the fifth ancestral founder, Huineng had to flee by night to [[Nanhua Temple]] in the south to avoid the wrath of Hongren's jealous senior disciples.

Modern scholarship, however, has questioned this narrative. Historic research reveals that this story was created around the middle of the 8th century, beginning in 731 by Shenhui, a successor to Huineng, to win influence at the Imperial Court. He claimed Huineng to be the successor of Hongren instead of Shenxiu, the recognized successor.&lt;ref name="McRae 2003"/&gt; In 745 Shenhui was invited to take up residence in the Heze Temple in the capital, Dongdu (modern [[Luoyang]]) In 753, he fell out of grace and had to leave Dongdu to go into exile.

The most prominent of the successors of Shenhui's lineage was [[Guifeng Zongmi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Yampolski|2003-A|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zongmi, Shenhui's approach was officially sanctioned in 796, when "an imperial commission determined that the Southern line of Ch'an represented the orthodox transmission and established Shen-hui as the seventh patriarch, placing an inscription to that effect in the Shen-lung temple".{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=279}}

Doctrinally, Shenhui's "Southern School" is associated with the teaching that [[Subitism|enlightenment is sudden]] while the "Northern" or East Mountain school is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is gradual. This was a polemical exaggeration since both schools were derived from the same tradition, and the so-called Southern School incorporated many teachings of the more influential Northern School.&lt;ref name="McRae 2003"/&gt; Eventually both schools died out, but the influence of Shenhui was so immense that all later Chan schools traced their origin to Huineng, and "sudden enlightenment" became a standard doctrine of Chan.&lt;ref name="McRae 2003"/&gt;

Shenhui's influence is traceable in the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'', which gives a popular account of the story of Huineng but also reconciles the antagonism created by Shenhui. Salient is that Shenhui himself does not figure in the ''Platform Sutra''; he was effectively written out of Chan history.{{sfn|MacRae|2003|p=63}} The ''Platform Sutra'' also reflects the growing popularity of the ''[[Diamond Sutra|Diamond Sūtra]]'' (''Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'') in 8th-century Chinese Buddhism.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=62}}{{sfn|Kasulis|1999|p=26–28}} Thereafter, the essential texts of the Chan school were often considered to be both the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' and the ''Diamond Sūtra''.{{sfn|Huaijin|1997|p=92}} The ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'', which endorses the Buddha-nature, emphasized purity of mind, which can be attained in gradations. The Diamond-sutra emphasizes sunyata, which "must be realized totally or not at all".{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26–28}} [[David Kalupahana]] associates the later [[Caodong school]] (Japanese [[Sōtō]], gradual) and [[Linji school]] (Japanese [[Rinzai school]], sudden) schools with the [[Yogacara]] and [[Madhyamaka]] philosophies respectively.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=228–236}} The same comparison has been made by McRae.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=123}} The Madhyamaka school elaborated on the theme of [[śūnyatā]], which was set forth in the [[prajnaparamita]] sutras, to which the ''Diamond Sutra'' also belongs.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=228–236}} The shift from the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'' to the ''Diamond Sutra'' also signifies a tension between Buddha-nature teachings, which imply a transcendental reality, versus śūnyatā, which denies such a transcendental reality.

===Tibetan Chan===
Chinese Chan Buddhist teachers such as [[Moheyan]] first went to Tibet in the eighth century during the height of the [[Tibetan Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik, Tibetan Zen, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; There seems to have been disputes between them and Indian Buddhists, as exemplified by the [[Samye#Debate at Samye or the Council of Lhasa|Samye debate]]. Many Tibetan Chan texts have been recovered from the caves at [[Dunhuang]], where Chan and Tantric Buddhists lived side by side and this led to [[religious syncretism]] in some cases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Sam van Schaik, Where Chan and Tantra Meet: Buddhist Syncretism in Dunhuang&lt;/ref&gt; Chan Buddhism survived in Tibet for several centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Zigmond, The Lost Tradition of Tibetan Zen
Dan Zigmond reviews Sam van Schaik’s The Lost Tradition of Tibetan Zen, https://tricycle.org/magazine/lost-tradition-tibetan-zen/&lt;/ref&gt; but had mostly been replaced by the 10th century developments in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. According to Sam Van Schaik:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After the 'dark period', all visible influences of Chan were eliminated from Tibetan Buddhism, and Mahayoga and Chan were carefully distinguished from each other. This trend
can already be observed in the tenth-century Lamp for the Eyes in Contemplation by the great central Tibetan scholar Gnubs chen Sangs rgyas ye shes. This influential work represented a crucial step in the codification of Chan, Mahayoga and the Great Perfection as distinct vehicles to enlightenment. In comparison, our group of [Dunhuang] manuscripts exhibits a remarkable freedom, blurring the lines between meditation systems which were elsewhere kept quite distinct. The system of practice set out in these manuscripts did not survive into the later Tibetan tradition. Indeed, this creative integration of meditation practices derived from both Indic and Chinese traditions could only have been possible during the earliest years of Tibetan Buddhism, when doctrinal categories were still forming, and in this sense it represents an important stage in the Tibetan assimilation of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Classical or Middle Chan – Tang dynasty (c. 750–1000)===
Daoxin, Hongren, Shenxiu, Huineng and Shenhui all lived during the early Tang. The later period of the [[Tang Dynasty]] is traditionally regarded as the "golden age" of Chan. This proliferation is described in a famous saying:{{sfn|Huaijin|1997|p=95}}
{{quote|Look at the territory of the house of Tang —''&lt;br&gt;''The whole of it is the realm of the Chan school.}}

====An Lu-shan rebellion====
The [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755–763) led to a loss of control by the Tang dynasty, and changed the Chan scene again. Metropolitan Chan began to lose its status, while "other schools were arising in outlying areas controlled by warlords. These are the forerunners of the Chan we know today. Their origins are obscure; the power of Shen-hui's preaching is shown by the fact that they all trace themselves to Hui-neng."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Yampolski|2003-A|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hung-chou School====
{{main article|Hongzhou school}}

[[File:RinzaiGigen.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Rinzai]]
The most important of these schools is the [[Hongzhou school]] (洪州宗) of [[Mazu Daoyi|Mazu]], to which also belong [[Shitou Xiqian|Shitou]], [[Baizhang Huaihai]], [[Huangbo Xiyun|Huangbo]] and [[Linji Yixuan|Linji]] (Rinzai). Linji is also regarded as the founder of one of the Five Houses.

This school developed "shock techniques such as shouting, beating, and using irrational retorts to startle their students into realization".{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|Chang|1967}} Some of these are common today, while others are found mostly in anecdotes. It is common in many Chan traditions today for Chan teachers to have a stick with them during formal ceremonies which is a symbol of authority and which can be also used to strike on the table during a talk.

These shock techniques became part of the traditional and still popular image of Chan masters displaying irrational and strange behaviour to aid their students.&lt;ref name="McRae 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Heine|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this image was due to later misinterpretations and translation errors, such as the loud belly shout known as ''katsu''. "Katsu" means "to shout", which has traditionally been translated as "yelled 'katsu'" – which should mean "yelled a yell".&lt;ref group=web&gt;See [http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Philosophical/Liberating_Language.html James D. Sellmann &amp; Hans Julius Schneider (2003), ''Liberating Language in Linji and Wittgenstein''. Asian Philosophy, Vol. 13, Nos. 2/3, 2003. Notes 26 and 41]&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known story depicts Mazu practicing dhyana, but being rebuked by his teacher [[Nanyue Huairang]], comparing seated meditation with polishing a tile.{{sfn|Faure|1997|p=73}} According to Faure, the criticism is not about dhyana as such, but "the idea of "becoming a Buddha" by means of any practice, lowered to the standing of a "means" to achieve an "end"".{{sfn|Faure|1997|p=73}} The criticism of seated dhyana reflects a change in the role and position of monks in Tang society, who "undertook only pious works, reciting sacred texts and remaining seated in ''dhyana''".{{sfn|Faure|1997|p=74}} Nevertheless, seated dhyana remained an important part of the Chan tradition, also due to the influence of [[Guifeng Zongmi]], who tried to balance dhyana and insight.{{sfn|Faure|1997|p=74}}

The Hung-chou school has been criticised for its radical [[subitism]]. Guifeng Zongmi (圭峰 宗密) (780–841), an influential teacher-scholar and patriarch of both the Chan and the [[Huayan school]], claimed that the Hongzhou school teaching led to a radical nondualism that denies the need for spiritual cultivation and moral discipline. While Zongmi acknowledged that the essence of Buddha-nature and its functioning in the day-to-day reality are but difference aspects of the same reality, he insisted that there is a difference.{{sfn|Gregory|2002}}

====Shitou Xiqian====
Traditionally [[Shitou Xiqian|Shítóu Xīqiān]] (Ch. 石頭希遷, c. 700 – c.790) is seen as the other great figure of this period. In the Chan lineages he is regarded as the predecessor of the [[Caodong]] ([[Sōtō]]) school.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|pp=165–166}} He is also regarded as the author of the [[Sandokai]], a poem which formed the basis for the [[Song of the Precious Mirror Samadhi]] of [[Dongshan Liangjie]] (Jp. Tōzan Ryōkan) and the teaching of the [[Five Ranks]].{{sfn|Wegner|2001}}{{sfn|Leighton|2000}}

====The Great Persecution====
During 845–846 [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]] persecuted the Buddhist schools in China:
{{quote|It was a desperate attempt on the part of the hard-pressed central government, which had been in disarray since the An Lu-shan rebellion of 756, to gain some measure of political, economic, and military relief by preying on the Buddhist temples with their immense wealth and extensive lands.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;}}

This persecution was devastating for metropolitan Chan, but the Chan school of Ma-tsu and his likes survived, and took a leading role in the Chan of the later Tang.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Yampolski|2003-A|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period (907–960/979)====
{{See also|Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period}}

After the fall of the [[Tang Dynasty]], China was without effective central control during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period. China was divided into several autonomous regions. Support for Buddhism was limited to a few areas. The [[Huayan school|Hua-yen]] and [[T'ient-tai]] schools suffered from the changing circumstances, since they had depended on imperial support. The collapse of T'ang society also deprived the aristocratic classes of wealth and influence, which meant a further drawback for Buddhism. Shenxiu's Northern School and Henshui's Southern School didn't survive the changing circumstances. Nevertheless, Chan emerged as the dominant stream within Chinese Buddhism, but with various schools developing various emphasises in their teachings, due to the regional orientation of the period. The [[Fayan school]], named after Fa-yen Wen-i (885–958) became the dominant school in the southern kingdoms of Nan-T'ang ([[Jiangxi]], Chiang-hsi) and [[Wuyue]] (Che-chiang).{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=86–87}}

===Literary Chan – Song dynasty (c. 960&amp;ndash;1300)===
{{See also|Song Dynasty}}

The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period was followed by the Song Dynasty, which established a strong central government. During the Song Dynasty, Chan (禪) was used by the government to strengthen its control over the country, and Chan grew to become the largest sect in [[Chinese Buddhism]]. An ideal picture of the Chan of the Tang period was produced, which served the legacy of this newly acquired status:
{{quote|In the Song dynasty (960–1279), Chinese Chan Buddhism reached something of a climax paradigm. By "climax paradigm", I mean a conceptual configuration by which Chan was described in written texts, practiced by its adherents, and by extension understood as a religious entity by the Chinese population as a whole ... Previous events in Chan were interpreted through the lens of the Song dynasty configuration, and subsequent developments in China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam were evaluated, even as they occurred, against what was known of the standards established during the Song. Thus the romanticized image of the great Tang dynasty masters – Mazu and his students, Caoshan, Dongshan, and their students, and of course Linji – was generated by Song dynasty authors and functioned within Song dynasty texts. Similarly, even where subsequent figures throughout East Asia – Hakuin Ekaku (1685–1769), the famous reviver of Japanese Rinzai, is the best example – evoke the examples of Bodhidharma, the Sixth Patriarch Huineng, Mazu, and the others, they do so through the conceptual filter of Song-dynasty Chan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McRae|1993|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Five Houses of Chan====
{{see also|Five Houses of Chan}}

During the Song the ''Five Houses (Ch. 五家) of Chan'', or five "schools", were recognized. These were not originally regarded as "schools" or "sects", but based on the various Chan-genealogies. Historically they have come to be understood as "schools".

The Five Houses of Chan are:&lt;ref name="Cleary 2005"/&gt;
* [[Guiyang school]] (潙仰宗), named after masters [[Guishan Lingyou]] (771–854) and Yangshan Huiji (813–890), dharma-descendants of [[Mazu Daoyi]];{{sfn|Yampolski|2003-A}}
* [[Linji school]] (臨濟宗), named after master [[Linji Yixuan]] (died 866), whose lineage came to be traced to Mazu, establishing him as the archetypal iconoclastic Chan-master;{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}
* [[Caodong]] school (曹洞宗), named after masters [[Dongshan Liangjie]] (807–869) and [[Caoshan Benji]] (840–901);
* [[Yunmen school]] (雲門宗), named after master [[Yunmen Wenyan]] (died 949), a student of [[Xuefeng Yicun]] (822–908), whose lineage was traced to [[Shitou Xiqian]]:{{sfn|Jones|2010}}
* [[Fayan school]] (法眼宗), named after master [[Fayan Wenyi]] (885–958), a "grand-student" of [[Xuefeng Yicun]].

====Rise of the Linji-school====
{{Main article|Linji school}}

The Linji-school became the dominant school within Chan, due to support from literati and the court.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} Before the Song Dynasty, the Linji-school is rather obscure, and very little is known about its early history.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A}} The first mention of Linji is in the ''Zutang ji'', compiled in 952, 86 years after Linji's death.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} But the ''Zutang ji'' pictures the [[Xuefeng Yicun]] lineage as heir to the legacy of Mazu and the Hongzhou-school.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}}

According to Welter, the real founder of the Linji-school was Shoushan (or Baoying) Shengnian (首山省念) (926–993), a fourth generation dharma-heir of Linji. The ''Tiansheng Guangdeng lu'' (天聖廣燈錄), "Tiansheng Era Expanded Lamp Record", compiled by the official Li Zunxu (李遵勗) (988–1038) confirms the status of Shoushan Shengnian, but also pictures Linji as a major Chan patriarch and heir to the Mazu, displacing the prominence of the Fayan-lineage.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} It also established the slogan of "a special transmission outside the teaching", supporting the Linji-school claim of "Chan as separate from and superior to all other Buddhist teachings".{{sfn|Young|2009}}

====Dahui Zonggao====
Over the course of Song Dynasty (960–1279), the Guiyang, Fayan, and Yunmen schools were gradually absorbed into the Linji. Song Chan was dominated by the Linji school of [[Dahui Zonggao]], which in turn became strongly affiliated to the Imperial Court:
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;the Ta-hui school of Sung Chan had become closely associated with the Sung court, high officials, and the literati [...] With the establishment of the [[Five Mountain System|Wu-shan (Gozan) system]] during the Southern Sung the school of Ta-hui took precedence. The Chinese bureaucratic system entered into Chan temples throughout the country, and a highly organized system of temple rank and administration developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Yampolski|2003-B|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Gozan system was a system of state-controlled temples, which were established by the Song government in all provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Yampolski|2003-B|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Koan-system====
The teaching styles and words of the classical masters were recorded in the so-called "encounter dialogues".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McRae|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snippets of these encounter dialogues were collected in texts as the ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'' (1125) of Yuanwu, ''[[The Gateless Gate]]'' (1228) of [[Wumen]], both of the Linji lineage, and the ''[[Book of Equanimity]]'' (1223) by [[Wansong Xingxiu]] of the Caodong lineage.

These texts became classic gōng'àn cases, together with verse and prose commentaries, which crystallized into the systematized [[koan|gōng'àn]] (koan) practice. According to Miura and Sasaki, "[I]t was during the lifetime of [[Yuanwu Keqin|Yüan-wu]]'s successor, [[Dahui Zonggao]] (大慧宗杲; 1089–1163) that Koan Chan entered its determinative stage."&lt;ref name="miura"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Isshū|1993|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gōng'àn practice was prevalent in the Linji school, to which [[Yuanwu Keqin|Yuanwu]] and Dahui belonged, but it was also employed on a more limited basis by the Caodong school.

The recorded encounter dialogues, and the koan collections which derived from this genre, mark a shift from solitary practice to interaction between master and student:
{{quote|The essence of enlightenment came to be identified with the interaction between masters and students. Whatever insight dhyana might bring, its verification was always interpersonal. In effect, enlightenment came to be understood not so much as an insight, but as a way of acting in the world with other people&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kasulis|2003|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This mutual enquiry of the meaning of the encounters of masters and students of the past gave students a role model:
{{quote|One looked at the enlightened activities of one's lineal forebears in order to understand one's own identity [...] taking the role of the participants and engaging in their dialogues instead{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=130}}{{refn|group=note|This role-taking is described by the Swedish psychologist of religion [[Hjalmar Sundén]], though McRae does not seem to be aware of this}}
Koan practice was a literary practice, styling snippets of encounter-dialogue into well-edited stories. It arose in interaction with "educated literati".&lt;ref name="McRae 2003 131"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McRae|2003|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} There were dangers involved in such a literary approach, such as fixing specific meanings to the cases.&lt;ref name="McRae 2003 131"/&gt; Dahui Zonggao is even said to have burned the woodblocks of the ''Blue Cliff Record'', for the hindrance it had become to study of Chan by his students&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Yampolski|2003-A|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Silent illumination====
The Caodong was the other school to survive into the Song period. Its main protagonist was Hung-chih Cheng-chueh, a contemporary of Dahui Zonggao. It put emphasis on "silent illumination", or "just sitting". This approach was attacked by Dahui as being mere passivity, and lacking emphasis on gaining insight into one's true nature. Cheng-chueh in his turn criticized the emphasis on koan study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Dumoulin|2005-A|pp=256–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-classical Chan (c. 1300–present)===

====Yuan Dynasty (1279–1368)====
The [[Yuan dynasty]] was the empire established by [[Kublai Khan]], the leader of the [[Borjigin]] clan, after the [[Mongol Empire]] conquered the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] and the [[Song dynasty|Southern Song Dynasty]]. Chan began to be mixed with [[Pure Land Buddhism]] as in the teachings of [[Zhongfeng Mingben]] (1263–1323).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

====Ming dynasty (1368–1644)====
Chan Buddhism enjoyed something of a revival in the [[Ming dynasty]], with teachers such as [[Hanshan Deqing]] (憨山德清), who wrote and taught extensively on both Chan and Pure Land Buddhism; Miyun Yuanwu (密雲圓悟), who came to be seen posthumously as the first patriarch of the [[Ōbaku]] school of [[Zen]]; and as [[Yunqi Zhuhong]] (雲棲祩宏) and [[Ouyi Zhixu]] (蕅益智旭).

Chan was taught alongside Pure Land Buddhism in many monasteries. In time much of the distinction between them was lost, and many masters taught both Chan and Pure Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Sharf|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the downfall of the Ming, several Chan masters fled to Japan, founding the Ōbaku school.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-B|p=299}}

====Qing Dynasty (1644–1912)====
In the beginning of the [[Qing dynasty]], Chan was "reinvented", by the "revival of beating and shouting practices" by Miyun Yuanwu (1566–1642), and the publication of the ''Wudeng yantong'' ("The strict transmission of the five Chan schools") by Feiyin Tongrong's (1593–1662), a dharma heir of Miyun Yuanwu. The book placed self-proclaimed Chan monks without proper Dharma transmission in the category of "lineage unknown" (''sifa weixiang''), thereby excluding several prominent Caodong monks.{{sfn|Meng-Tat Chia|2011}}

===Modernisation===

====19th century (late Qing Dynasty)====
Around 1900, Buddhists from other Asian countries showed a growing interest in Chinese Buddhism. [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] visited Shaghai in 1893,&lt;ref group=web name="HodusIX"&gt;[http://www.authorama.com/buddhism-and-buddhists-in-china-10.html Lewis Hodus (1923), ''Buddhism and Buddhists in China. Chapter IX: Present-Day Buddhism'']&lt;/ref&gt; intending "to make a tour of China, to arouse the Chinese Buddhists to send missionaries to India to restore Buddhism there, and then to start a propaganda throughout the whole world", but eventually limiting his stay to Shanghai.&lt;ref group=web name="HodusIX" /&gt; Japanese Buddhist missionaries were active in China in the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref group=web name="HodusIX" /&gt;

====Republic of China (1912–1949) – First Buddhist Revival====
{{See also|Republic of China (1912–49)}}
[[File:Master Wei-Chueh.png|thumb|right|upright|Traditional Chan Buddhist Grand Master [[Wei Chueh]] in [[Taiwan]], sitting in meditation.]]

The modernisation of China led to the end of the Chinese Empire, and the installation of the Republic of China, which lasted on the mainland until the [[Chinese Civil War|Communist Revolution]] and the installation of the People's Republic of China in 1949.

After further centuries of decline during the Qing, Chan was revived again in the early 20th century by [[Hsu Yun]] (虛雲), a well-known figure of 20th-century Chinese Buddhism. Many Chan teachers today trace their lineage to Hsu Yun, including [[Sheng-yen]] (聖嚴) and [[Hsuan Hua]] (宣化), who have propagated Chan in the West where it has grown steadily through the 20th and 21st century.

The Buddhist reformist [[Taixu]] propagated a Chan-influenced [[humanistic Buddhism]], which is endorsed by Jing Hui, former abbott of [[Pagoda of Bailin Temple|Bailin Monastery]].{{sfn|Feuchtwang|2010|p=189}}

Until 1949, monasteries were built in the Southeast Asian countries, for example by monks of [[Guanghua Temple (Putian)|Guanghua Monastery]], to spread Chinese Buddhism. Presently, Guanghua Monastery has seven branches in the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.longquanzs.org/eng/masters.php?tit=Monastery&amp;id=4 Voice of Longquan, ''Guanghua Monastery''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218221925/http://www.longquanzs.org/eng/masters.php?tit=Monastery&amp;id=4 |date=2012-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====People's Republic of China (1949–present) – Second Buddhist Revival====
{{See also|China}}

Chan was repressed in China during the recent modern era in the early periods of the People's Republic, but subsequently had been re-asserting itself on the mainland, and has a significant following in [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]] as well as among [[Overseas Chinese]].

Since the [[Chinese economic reform]] of the 1970s, a new revival of Chinese Buddhism is going on.{{sfn|Laliberte|2011}}{{sfn|Lai|2003}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.ipsnews.net/2010/11/religion-china-buddhism-enjoys-a-revival/ Mitch Moxley (2010), ''Buddhism Enjoys A Revival'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.chinainst.org/en/articles/chinese-history-culture/a-revival-of-buddhism.php Erica B.

[[Guanghua Temple (Putian)|Guanghua Monastery]] was restored beginning in 1979, when a six-year restoration program began under the supervision of then 70-year-old Venerable Master Yuanzhou (圆拙老法师). In 1983 the temple became one of the Chinese Buddhism Regional Temples (汉族地区全国重点寺院) whilst 36-year-old Master Yiran (毅然法師) became abbot. The same year, Venerable Master Yuanzhou funded the establishment of the new Fujian Buddhism Academy (福建佛学院) on the site.

====Taiwan====
{{See also|Taiwan|Buddhism in Taiwan}}

Several Chinese Buddhist teachers left China during the Communist Revolution, and settled in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

[[Sheng Yen]] (1930–2009) was the founder of the [[Dharma Drum Mountain]], a Buddhist organization based in [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]. During his time in Taiwan, Sheng Yen was well known as one of the progressive Buddhist teachers who sought to teach Buddhism in a modern and Western-influenced world.

[[Wei Chueh]] (1928–2016) was born in [[Sichuan]], China, and ordained in Taiwan. In 1982, he founded Lin Quan Temple in Taipei County and became known for his teaching on [[Ch'an]] practices by offering many lectures and seven-day Ch'an retreats. His order is called [[Chung Tai Shan]].

Two additional traditions emerged in the 1960s, based their teaching on [[Ch'an]] practices.

[[Cheng Yen]] (born 1937), a Buddhist nun, founded  the [[Tzu Chi|Tzu Chi Foundation]] as a charity organization with [[Buddhist]] origins on 14 May 1966 in [[Hualien City|Hualien]], Taiwan. She was inspired by her master and mentor, the late Venerable Master [[Yin Shun]] (印順導師, Yìn Shùn dǎoshī) a proponent of [[Humanistic Buddhism]], who exhorted her to "work for Buddhism and for all sentient beings". The organisation began with a motto of "instructing the rich and saving the poor" as a group of thirty [[housewives]] who donated a small amount of money each day to care for needy families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Dharma Master Cheng Yen|url=http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=159%3Aintroduction&amp;catid=81%3Aabout&amp;Itemid=198&amp;lang=en|website=tw.tzuchi.org|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hsing Yun]] (born 1927), founded the Fo Guang Shan an international [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] [[new religious movement]] based in [[Taiwan]] in 1967. The order promotes [[Humanistic Buddhism]]. Fo Guang Shan also calls itself the International Buddhist Progress Society.  The headquarters of Fo Guang Shan, located in [[Dashu District]], [[Kaohsiung]], is the largest Buddhist monastery in Taiwan. Hsing Yun's stated position within Fo Guang Shan is that it is an "amalgam of all Eight Schools of Chinese Buddhism" ({{lang|zh|八宗兼弘}}), including Chan. Fo Guang Shan is the most comprehensive of the major Buddhist organizations of Taiwan, focusing extensively on both social works and religious engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schak|first=David|last2=Hsiao|first2=Hsin-Huang Michael|date=2005-06-01|title=Taiwan's Socially Engaged Buddhist Groups|url=https://chinaperspectives.revues.org/2803#tocto2n1|journal=China Perspectives|language=fr|issue=59|issn=1996-4617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Taiwan, these four masters are popularly referred to as the "[[Buddhism in Taiwan|Four Heavenly Kings]]" of Taiwanese Buddhism, with their respective organizations [[Dharma Drum Mountain]], [[Chung Tai Shan]], [[Tzu Chi]], and [[Fo Guang Shan]] being referred to as the "Four Great Mountains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html |title=Come to Taiwan,Return with good memories |publisher=Info.taiwan.net.tw |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227183910/http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html |archivedate=2012-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shuai|first=J.

==Spread of Chan Buddhism in Asia==
{{See also|Zen#Spread of Chan Buddhism in Asia|l1=Spread of Chan Buddhism in Asia}}

===Thiền in Vietnam===
{{See also|Vietnamese Thiền|Buddhism in Vietnam}}
According to traditional accounts of Vietnam, in 580 an Indian monk named [[Vinītaruci]] ({{lang-vi|Tì-ni-đa-lưu-chi}}) travelled to Vietnam after completing his studies with [[Sengcan]], the third patriarch of Chinese Chan. This, then, would be the first appearance of [[Vietnamese Thiền|Thiền Buddhism]]. Other early Thiền schools included that of [[Wu Yantong]] ({{cjkv|c=無言通|v=Vô Ngôn Thông}}), which was associated with the teachings of Mazu Daoyi, and the Thảo Đường (Caodong), which incorporated [[nianfo]] chanting techniques; both were founded by Chinese monks.

===Seon in Korea===
{{See also|Korean Seon|Korean Buddhism}}

Seon was gradually transmitted into Korea during the late [[Silla]] period (7th through 9th centuries) as Korean monks of predominantly [[Hwaeom]] ({{Korean|hangul=화엄종|hanja=華嚴宗}}) and [[East Asian Yogācāra]] ({{Korean|hanja=唯識宗|hangul=유식종}}) background began to travel to China to learn the newly developing tradition. Seon received its most significant impetus and consolidation from the [[Goryeo]] monk [[Jinul]] (知訥) (1158–1210), who established a reform movement and introduced [[kōan]] practice to Korea. Jinul established the [[Songgwangsa]] (松廣寺) as a new center of pure practice.

===Zen in Japan===
{{See also|Zen}}
[[Zen]] was not introduced as a separate school in Japan until the 12th century when [[Eisai]] traveled to China and returned to establish a Linji lineage, which is known in Japan as the Rinzai. In 1215, [[Dōgen]], a younger contemporary of Eisai's, journeyed to China himself, where he became a disciple of the Caodong master [[Rujing]]. After his return, [[Dōgen]] established the Sōtō school, the Japanese branch of Caodong.

The schools of Zen that currently exist in Japan are the Sōtō, Rinzai and [[Ōbaku]]. Of these, Sōtō is the largest and Ōbaku the smallest. Rinzai is itself divided into several subschools based on temple affiliation, including [[Myōshin-ji]], [[Nanzen-ji]], [[Tenryū-ji]], [[Daitoku-ji]], and [[Tōfuku-ji]].

===Chan in Indonesia===
{{See also|Buddhism in Indonesia|Ashin Jinarakkhita}}

In the 20th century, during the First Buddhist revival, missionaries were sent to Indonesia and Malaysia. [[Ashin Jinarakkhita]], who played a central role in the revival of Indonesian Buddhism, received ordination as a Chan [[śrāmaṇera]] on July 29, 1953&lt;ref group=web name="Ditthi"&gt;[http://www.buddhismandaustralia.com/index.php/en/articles/articles-2012/102-buddhism-in-indonesia-past-and-present-ven-ditthisampanno.html Ven.

==Chan in the Western world==
{{See also|Buddhism in the West|Japanese Zen#Zen in the Western world}}

Chan has become especially popular in its Japanese form. Although it is difficult to trace when the West first became aware of Chan as a distinct form of Buddhism, the visit of [[Soyen Shaku]], a Japanese Zen monk, to [[Chicago]] during the [[Parliament of the World's Religions#1893 Parliament|1893 Parliament of the World's Religions]] is often pointed to as an event that enhanced its profile in the Western world. It was during the late 1950s and the early 1960s that the number of Westerners pursuing a serious interest in Zen, other than the descendants of Asian immigrants, reached a significant level.

===Western Chan lineages===
{{See also|Zen#Western Zen lineages|l1=Western Zen lineages}}

[[Image:CTTBgate.jpg|thumb|right|Covering over 480 acres of land and located in [[Talmage, California]], the [[City of Ten Thousand Buddhas]] was founded by Hsuan Hua.]]

The first Chinese master to teach Westerners in North America was [[Hsuan Hua]], who taught Chan and other traditions of [[Chinese Buddhism]] in [[San Francisco]] during the early 1960s. He went on to found the [[City Of Ten Thousand Buddhas]], a monastery and retreat center located on a 237-acre (959,000 m²) property near [[Ukiah, California]], founding the [[Dharma Realm Buddhist Association]]. Another Chinese Chan teacher with a Western following is [[Sheng-yen]], a master trained in both the Caodong and Linji schools. He first visited the United States in 1978 under the sponsorship of the [[Buddhist Association of the United States]], and subsequently founded the CMC Chan Meditation Center in [[Queens, New York]] and the [[Dharma Drum Retreat Center]] in [[Pine Bush, New York]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;Dharma Drum Mountain. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100613041853/http://chan1.org/biography.html Who Is Master Sheng-yen].&lt;/ref&gt;

==New religious movements==
[[Fo Guang Shan]] is a Taiwan-based [[new religious movement]] with branches worldwide. It belongs to the Chan school; its founder, [[Hsing Yun]], is a Linji lineage holder.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Doctrinal background==
{{Main article|Doctrinal background of Zen}}

Though Zen-narrative states that it is a "special transmission outside scriptures" which "did not stand upon words",{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=85–94}} Zen does have a rich doctrinal background.

===Polarities===
Classical Chinese Chan is characterised by a set of polarities:{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=138–142}} absolute-relative,&lt;ref name="Liang-Chieh 1986 9"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha-nature – sunyata,{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26–29}} sudden and gradual enlightenment,{{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=123–138}} esoteric and exoteric transmission.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}}

====Absolute-relative====
The [[Prajnaparamita]] sutras and [[Madhyamaka]] emphasize the non-duality of form and emptiness: "form is emptiness, emptiness is form", as the ''[[Heart sutra]]'' says.&lt;ref name="Liang-Chieh 1986 9"/&gt; This was understood to mean that ultimate reality is not a transcendental realm, but equal to the daily world of relative reality. This idea fitted into the Chinese culture, which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world. This question is answered in such schemata as the [[Five Ranks]] of Tozan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kasulis|2003|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ten Bulls]] ("the Oxherding Pictures"), and [[Hakuin Ekaku#Four ways of knowing|Hakuin's Four ways of knowing]].{{sfn|Low|2006}}

The Madhyamaka [[two truths doctrine]] and the Yogacara [[Yogacara#The Three Natures|three natures]] and [[Trikaya]] doctrines also give depictions of the interplay between the absolute and the relative.

====Buddha-nature and śūnyatā====
When Buddhism was introduced in China it was understood in native terms. Various sects struggled to attain an understanding of the Indian texts. The ''[[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras]]'' and the idea of the [[Buddha-nature]] were endorsed because of the perceived similarities with the [[Tao]], which was understood as a transcendental reality underlying the world of appearances. [[Śūnyatā]] at first was understood as pointing to the Taoist ''[[Mu (negative)|wu]]''.{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}}{{sfn|Swanson|1993|p=373}}

The doctrine of the Buddha-nature asserts that all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] have [[Buddha-nature]] (Skt. ''Buddhadhātu'', "Buddha Element", "Buddha-Principle"), the element from which awakening springs. The ''Tathāgatagarbha sutras'' state that every living being has the potential to realize awakening.{{sfn|Wayman|1990}} Hence Buddhism offers salvation to every-one, not only to monks or those who have freed themselves almost completely from karma in previous lives.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The Yogacara theory of the [[Eight Consciousnesses]] explains how sensory input and the mind create the world we experience, and obscure the alaya-vijnana, which is equated to the Buddha-nature.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992}}

When this potential is realized, and the defilements have been eliminated, the Buddha-nature manifests as the [[Dharmakaya]], the absolute reality which pervades everything in the world.{{sfn|Wayman|1990}} In this way, it is also the primordial reality from which phenomenal reality springs. When this understanding is idealized, it becomes a transcendental reality beneath the world of appearances.{{sfn|Kalupahan|1994}}

Sunyata points to the "emptiness" or no-"thing"-ness of all "things". Though we perceive a world of concrete and discrete objects, designated by names, on close analysis the "thingness" dissolves, leaving them "empty" of inherent existence.{{sfn|Kalupahan|1994|p=160–169}} The ''Heart sutra'', a text from the prajñaparamita sutras, articulates this in the following saying in which the [[skandha|five skandhas]] are said to be "empty":

Yogacara explains this "emptiness" in an analysis of the way we perceive "things". Everything we conceive of is the result of the working of the five skandhas—results of perception, feeling, volition, and discrimination.{{refn|group=note|Translations do differ, which makes a difference. [[Vijñāna]] can be translated as "consciousness", but also as "discernment".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992}}}} The five skandhas together compose consciousness. The "things" we are conscious of are "mere concepts", not [[noumenon]].{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992}}

It took Chinese Buddhism several centuries to recognize that śūnyatā is not identical to "wu",{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}}{{sfn|Swanson|1993}} nor does Buddhism postulate a permanent soul.{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}} The influence of those various doctrinal and textual backgrounds is still discernible in Zen. Zen teachers still refer to Buddha-nature, but the Zen tradition also emphasizes that Buddha-nature ''is'' śūnyatā, the absence of an independent and substantial self.{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}}

====Sudden and gradual enlightenment====
[[File:Kano White-robed Kannon, Bodhisattva of Compassion.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Avalokiteśvara]] sitting in meditation]]

In Zen Buddhism two main views on the way to enlightenment are discernible, namely [[subitism|sudden]] and gradual enlightenment.

Early Chan recognized the "transcendence of the body and mind", followed by "non-defilement [of] knowledge and perception", or sudden insight into the true nature ([[kenshō|''jiànxìng'']]) followed by gradual purification of intentions.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=88–92}}

In the 8th century Chan history was effectively refashioned by [[Shenhui]], who created a dichotomy between the so-called [[East Mountain Teaching]] or "Northern School", led by [[Yuquan Shenxiu]], and his own line of teaching, which he called the "Southern school".{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=54–56}} Shenhui placed [[Huineng]] into prominence as the sixth Chan-patriarch, and emphasized ''sudden enlightenment'', as opposed to the concurrent Northern School's alleged ''gradual enlightenment''.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=54–56}} According to the ''sudden enlightenment'' propagated by Shenhui, insight into true nature is sudden; thereafter there can be no misunderstanding anymore about this true nature.

In the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'', the dichotomy between sudden and gradual is reconciled.{{sfn|MacRae|2003|p=60-67}} [[Guifeng Zongmi]], fifth-generation successor to Shenhui, also softened the edge between sudden and gradual. In his analysis, sudden awakening points to seeing into one's true nature, but is to be followed by a gradual cultivation to attain [[Buddhahood]].{{sfn|Gregory|1991}}

This gradual cultivation is also recognized by [[Dongshan Liangjie]] (Japanese ''Tōzan''), who described the five ranks of enlightenment.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.nl/2008/02/tozan-ryokais-verses-on-five-ranks.html The Five Ranks of Tozan]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Esoteric and exoteric transmission====
According to Borup the emphasis on 'mind to mind transmission' is a form of esoteric transmission, in which "the tradition and the enlightened mind is transmitted face to face".{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}} Metaphorically this can be described as the transmission from a flame from one candle to another candle,{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}} or the transmission from one vein to another.{{sfn|Faure|2000|p=58}} In exoteric transmission requires "direct access to the teaching through a personal discovery of one's self. This type of transmission and identification is symbolized by the discovery of a shining lantern, or a mirror."{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}}

===Chan scripture===
{{main article|Zen and Sutras}}

Chan is deeply rooted in the teachings and doctrines of Mahāyāna Buddhism. What the Chan tradition emphasizes is that enlightenment of the Buddha came not through intellectual reasoning, but rather through self-realization in Dharma practice and meditation. Therefore, it is held that it is primarily through Dharma practice and meditation that others may attain enlightenment and become Buddhas as well.

A review of the early historical documents and literature of early Chan masters clearly reveals that they were all well versed in numerous Mahāyāna Buddhist sūtras. For example, in the ''[[Platform Sutra|Platform Sūtra of the Sixth Patriarch]]'', [[Huineng]] cites and explains the ''Diamond Sūtra'', the ''[[Lotus Sutra|Lotus Sūtra]]'' (''Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra''), the ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra|Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa Sūtra]]'', the ''[[Shurangama Sutra|Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]'', and the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra''.

The Chan school had to develop a doctrinal tradition of its own to establish its position.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Subsequently, the Chan tradition produced a rich corpus of written literature which has become a part of its practice and teaching. Among the earliest and most widely studied of the specifically Chan texts, dating to at least the 9th century CE, is the ''Platform Sūtra of the Sixth Patriarch'', attributed to Huineng. The most important Chan texts belong to the "encounter dialogue" genre, which developed into various collections of ''[[koan|kōans]]''.

==Teaching and practice==
:''See also [[Zen#Zen practice|Zen practice]]''

===Bodhisattva ideal===
As a school of Mahāyāna Buddhism, Chan draws many of its basic driving concepts from that tradition, such as the [[Bodhisattva]] ideal. [[Karuṇā]] is the counterpart of [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]. [[Avalokitesvara|Avalokiteśvara]] embodies the striving for [[Karuṇā|Karuna]], compassion.{{sfn|Lathouwers|2000}}{{refn|group=note|{{Harvcolnb|Lathouwers|2000|p=221}} mentions: Blofeld, John (1988), ''Bodhisattva of compassion - the mystical tradition of kuan Yin''. Boston: Shanbhala}}

Central to Chan practice is dhyana or meditation. In the Lin-ji (Rinzai) school this is supplemented with koan study.

===Chan meditation===
In meditation practice, the Chan tradition holds that the very notions of doctrine and teachings create various other notions and appearances (Skt. ''[[saṃjñā]]''; Ch. 相, ''xiāng'') that obscure the transcendent wisdom of each being's Buddha-nature. The process of rediscovery goes under various terms such as "introspection", "a backward step", "turning-about" or "turning the eye inward".

====Sitting meditation====
{{Main article|Zazen}}
Sitting meditation is called ''zuòchán'' (坐禅), ''[[zazen]]'' in Japanese, both simply meaning "sitting [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]". During this sitting meditation, practitioners usually assume a position such as the [[lotus position]], half-lotus, Burmese, or [[seiza]] postures. To regulate the mind, awareness is directed towards counting or watching the breath, or put in the energy center below the navel (see also [[anapanasati]]).&lt;ref group=web name="shengyen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundamentals of Meditation|last=Sheng|first=Yen|url=http://www.chan1.org/ddp/talks/zuochan.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613045554/http://chan1.org/ddp/talks/zuochan.html|archivedate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, a square or round cushion placed on a padded mat is used to sit on; in some other cases, a chair may be used.

At the beginning of the Song Dynasty, practice with the koan method became popular, whereas others practiced "silent illumination."{{sfn|Blyth|1966}} This became the source of some differences in practice between the Linji and Caodong traditions.

===Koan practice===
{{Main article|Koan}}

A koan (literally "public case") is a story or dialogue, generally related to Chan or other Buddhist history; the most typical form is an anecdote involving early Chinese Chan masters. These anecdotes involving famous Chan teachers are a practical demonstration of their wisdom, and can be used to test a student's progress in Chan practice. Koans often appear to be [[paradox]]ical or linguistically meaningless dialogues or questions. But to Chan Buddhists the koan is "the place and the time and the event where truth reveals itself"{{sfn|Shimano|1991|p=152}} unobstructed by the oppositions and differentiations of language. Answering a koan requires a student to let go of conceptual thinking and of the logical way we order the world, so that, like creativity in art, the appropriate insight and response arises naturally and spontaneously in the mind.

==Chan monasticism==
Chan developed a distinct monastic system.

===Emphasizing daily life===
As the Chan school grew in China, the monastic discipline also became distinct, focusing on practice through all aspects of life. Temples began emphasizing labor and humility, expanding the training of Chan to include the mundane tasks of daily life. [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki|D.T. Suzuki]] wrote that aspects of this life are: a life of humility; a life of labor; a life of service; a life of prayer and gratitude; and a life of meditation.{{sfn|Suzuki|2004}} The Chinese Chan master [[Baizhang]] (720–814 [[Common Era|CE]]) left behind a famous saying which had been the guiding principle of his life, "A day without work is a day without food".&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buddhism-dict.net/ddb/|title=Digital Dictionary of Buddhism|accessdate=2008-03-26}}, entry "Baizhang Huaihai"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinification of Buddhism in China===
It was scholar [[D.T. Suzuki]]'s contention that a spiritual awakening was always the goal of Chan's training, but that part of what distinguished the tradition as it developed through the centuries in China was a way of life radically different from that of Indian Buddhists. In Indian Buddhism, the tradition of the [[mendicant]] prevailed, but Suzuki explained that in China social circumstances led to the development of a temple and training-center system in which the abbot and the monks all performed mundane tasks. These included food gardening or farming, carpentry, architecture, housekeeping, administration (or community direction), and the practice of [[Traditional Chinese medicine]]. Consequently, the enlightenment sought in Chan had to stand up well to the demands and potential frustrations of everyday life.{{sfn|Suzuki|1955|p=155–156}}{{sfn|Suzuki|1970}}

The chromatic fourth was first used in the [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s of the 16th Century.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} The Latin term itself—"harsh" or "difficult" (''duriusculus'') "step" or "passage" (''passus'')—originates in [[Christoph Bernhard]]'s 17th century ''Tractatus compositionis augmentatus'' (1648–49), where it appears to refer to repeated melodic motion by semitone creating consecutive semitones.&lt;ref name="Monelle"/&gt; The term may also relate to the ''[[pianto]]'' associated with weeping.&lt;ref name="Monelle"/&gt; In the Baroque, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] used it in his choral as well as his instrumental music, in the ''[[Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', for example (the chromatic fourth is indicated by a red bracket), {{audio|Bach Example wHiLite.mid|Play}}:

[[File:Bach Example wHiLite.png|400px]]

In operas of the Baroque and Classical, the chromatic fourth was often used in the bass and for woeful arias, often being called a "[[lament bass]]". In the penultimate pages of the first movement of [[Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], the  chromatic fourth appears in the cellos and basses.

[[File:Vivaldi lament bass from RV 631, Aria No. 2.png|thumb|center|400px|Lament bass from [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]]'s motet ''"O qui coeli terraeque serenitas"'' [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV]] 631, Aria No. 2&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Peter (1998). ''The Chromatic Fourth: During Four Centuries of Music'', p.69. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-816563-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Vivaldi lament bass from RV 631, Aria No. 2.mid|Play}}.]]

This does not mean that the chromatic fourth was always used in a sorrowful or foreboding way, or that the boundaries should always be the tonic and dominant notes. One counterexample comes from the Minuet of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s [[String Quartet No. 14 (Mozart)|String Quartet in G major]], [[Köchel number|K.]] 387 (the chromatic fourths are conveniently bracketed by the slurs and set apart with note-to-note dynamics changes), {{audio|K387m2 IVln.mid|Play}}:

'''David B. Zilberman'''  (Russian: [[:ru:Зильберман, Давид Беньяминович|Дави́д Бениами́нович Зильберма́н]]; May 25, 1938, Odessa – July 25, 1977, Boston) was a Russian-American philosopher and sociologist, scholar of Indian philosophy and culture.
Well-versed in the study of language, he knew Russian, Sanskrit, English, French, Slavic languages, German.

==Life and work==

===USSR===
David Zilberman was born in Odessa, Ukraine on May 25, 1938, to Benjamin Zilberman, an engineer-economist, and Riva Timaner, a doctor. He graduated high school in 1955. In 1962, Zilberman was awarded an engineering and meteorology degree from The Odessa State College of Meteorology. From 1962 until 1966, Zilberman was employed as a meteorologist at the local airport in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, in Central Asia.

Zilberman began his Indological studies in 1962.  He met and became friends with the academician [[:ru:Смирнов, Борис Леонидович|Boris Smirnov]], a medical doctor, a Sanskritist, and a leading theosopher in Russia. Zilberman studied Sanskrit under Smirnov while pursuing Indological investigations in logic, Indian yoga, and ritual.  In Turkmenistan he also studied a number of languages in addition to Sanskrit, including Greek, Latin, basic Romano-Germanic languages, and some Slavic languages, and he began writing philosophical essays.

In 1966 Zilberman returned to Odessa. He continued with his philosophical investigations on his own and participated in the Colloquium for Philosophy &amp; History at Odessa State University (organized by Professor [[:ru:Уёмов, Авенир Иванович|Avenir Ujemov]] Director of the Department of Philosophy). In 1968 he completed a two-year program at the State Institute of Patent Service.  During that period, Zilberman worked at the Odessa State College of Meteorology performing research.  And he worked for a time at a Construction &amp; Development firm for the Black Sea Fleet as a Patent Lawyer.

In 1968 Zilberman was introduced to Professor [[Georgy Shchedrovitsky|Georgy Schedrovitsky]] who headed the Moscow School of Methodology. Schedrovitsky recommended Zilberman to one of Russia's leading sociologists, Professor [[Yuri Levada]], for the post-graduate program at the Institute for Concrete Sociological Research (IKSI) in Moscow. Zilberman participated in the organized by Levada Methodological seminar which united supporters of many different scientific areas and was for a long time considered a semi-legal institution. Zilberman was also a participating member of the Moscow School of Methodology. Participants in the Moscow School seminars included: Alexander Zinoviev, Evald Ilyenkov, Georgy Schedrovitsky, Alexander Piatigorsky, Merab Mamardashvili, Lefebvre, Boris Grushin, Oleg Genisaretsky and others. The School was believed by some to be the source of the most important developments in philosophy in the post-War period, rivaling anything done in the Western analytical tradition. The Moscow School of Methodology remains virtually unknown in the West.

During these years Zilberman translated numerous Hindu and Buddhist texts, poetic abstracts from "The Mahabharata", and part of the Tattva-Cintamani tetralogy from Sanskrit.  He wrote articles on Indian philosophy, on sociology and anthropology, and on the sociological theory of tradition, a largely overlooked topic in modern social science.

Zilberman worked closely with [[Alexander Piatigorsky]], writing a number of articles for ''The Great Soviet Encyclopedia''. After leaving the USSR they remained close friends and continued their collaborative research and publication efforts until Zilberman's death in July 1977.

Zilberman's dissertation, ''A Study of Tradition'', became a major project and the focus of his efforts during his final years in the Soviet Union.  Completed in 1972, the work was accepted but remained unpublished due to the unexpected and sudden Soviet suppression of sociological and related research (an event described in Zilberman's "Post-Sociological Society"). The IKSI was closed and it essentially disappeared.  Its members were forced to operate behind the [[Iron Curtain]] in a context of severely limited public visibility and without proper scientific recognition under conditions of heightened Soviet-style repression.

In 1972, as he completed his research and wrote his thesis, Zilberman discovered a new type of methodological-philosophical thinking "unlike the known types" which became his central preoccupation for the rest of his life. He called the new method "Modal Methodology."

In 1972, due to an offer accepted by Zilberman to publish an article about Kabbalah abroad, he reportedly became a target of KGB surveillance. Leaving Moscow, Zilberman returned again to Odessa. To earn a living he undertook numerous translations for the Moscow Patriarchy, translating much of the ''Oxford Theological Dictionary'' from English to Russian, as well as the ''History of French Royal Court'' from French.

Zilberman translated into Russian the book by D. Ingalls ''Navya-Nyāya Logic'' and wrote an introductory section to the work dealing with some epistemological aspects of Indian formal logic. The book was published in 1974 in Moscow but without his name.

=== United States ===

In 1973, David Zilberman and his family emigrated to the United States. In 1973 Zilberman received a position as a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology at [[Hunter College]] in New York. In September 1974, Zilberman accepted a position as Post-doctoral Fellow with the Committee on South Asian Studies at the [[University of Chicago]].

For the last two years of his life Zilberman taught at [[Brandeis University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], first in the Department of Anthropology, and later in the Department of Philosophy and History of Ideas.  Zilberman taught a variety of courses in Indian and Western philosophy, and related disciplines.

Meanwhile, Zilberman started a book dedicated to thorough research and analysis of the Russian Soviet Philosophy (the manuscript titled ''Moscow School of Methodology'' was left unfinished).

David Zilberman died on July 1977 in a car-bicycle collision while returning home from his last seminar with his students at Brandeis.

His wife Elena Michnik-Zilberman lives in Florida, the younger daughter Alexandra Curtis lives in New York, the older daughter Natalya Carney lives in Boston. His sister Rachel Zilberman lives in Chicago.

==Legacy==

David Zilberman created a distinctive type of methodological-philosophical thinking, which he called "Modal Methodology" or "Modal Metaphysics", and through this practice defined the "Sum of the Metaphysics".

Zilberman attempted to develop the Philosophia Universalis from classical Hindu philosophies and applied it as a new synthesis to Western philosophy.

Some contemporary Russian philosophers consider themselves to be David Zilberman followers.

An '''explanatory model''' is a useful description of why and how a thing works or an explanation of why a phenomenon is the way it is. The explanatory model is used as a substitute for "the&amp;nbsp;full&amp;nbsp;explanation" of the thing in question: 
* either because the full&amp;nbsp;explanation is unavailable
* or because the&amp;nbsp;full&amp;nbsp;explanation is too cumbersome to be practical in the case at hand.

Explanatory models do not claim to be a complete description/explanation of the absolute about the thing/phenomenon, nor do they even claim to, necessarily, be fully accurate. The description/explanation does, however, need to fit well enough to a sufficient portion of all the knowledge, observations and theoretical circumstances known about the thing/phenomenon, so that the explanatory model becomes useful.
That is: the description/explanation in an explanatory model, should be useful/helpful when one is about to make a decision or choice or when trying to successfully understand, explain or in some other way relate to the reality of the world around .Tewodros kassa

==Use of the term==
As most, if not all, explanations of anything, to a certain degree depend on [[axiom]]s, and thereby are incomplete and not really "the&amp;nbsp;''full''&amp;nbsp;explanation", then, strictly speaking, all explanations are in fact explanatory models.&lt;br&gt;
Yet,  the term "explanatory model" generally is used only when one feels the need to ''emphasize awareness of'' the incompleteness of an explanation (due to intentional simplification or due to lack of knowledge and understanding).

==Utility==
By being mindful of the difference between on the one hand: "absolute reality" and on the other hand: "the explanatory models that one has become accustomed to", then one will be better equipped to avoid erroneously rejecting important new knowledge, even when this new knowledge seem to clearly contradict that which one "knows" from before.

'''Ferdinand Alquié''' ({{IPA-fr|alkje|lang|Fr-Ferdinand Alquié.oga}}; ([[Carcassonne]], [[Aude]], 18 December 1906 – 28 February 1985, [[Montpellier]]) was a French philosopher and member of the [[Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques]] from 1978.
In the years 1931 to 1945 he was a professor in various provincial and Parisian lycees, and later at the [[University of Montpellier]] and [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] where he worked until he retired in 1979.

==Career==
Alquie's career was dominated by the decades-long polemic between himself as a Cartesian and the Spinozian perspective of his rival [[Martial Gueroult]].  He was vehemently opposed to all forms of philosophical monism and felt that human life is permeated by various forms of [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]].  He was opposed to totalitarianism and Marxism and as a close friend of André Breton, he aligned himself with the surrealist project.

He was an instructor of [[Gilles Deleuze]], whom, according to [[Michael Hardt]], he accused of drawing on [[biology]], [[psychology]], and other fields, neglecting [[philosophy]]. Deleuze responded by agreeing with Alquié and moreover, he argued that his primary interest was precisely in the metaphysics science needs rather than in the science philosophy needs. Alquié went on to direct Deleuze's secondary thesis, "Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza." Also among his students at the Sorbonne was the Finnish feminist philosopher and Descartes specialist [[Lilli Alanen]]. 

Alquié has published many books about [[Descartes]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Spinoza]], as well as a book on [[Nicolas Malebranche]]. He was close to the artist [[André Breton]] and wrote ''Philosophy of Surrealism'' (1955), which espoused a view of [[surrealism]] as a form of [[humanism]] that values the vibrant potential of the [[unconscious mind]].

The '''Global Vipassana Pagoda''' is a [[Meditation#Buddhism|Meditation]] Dome Hall with a capacity to seat around 8,000 Vipassana meditators (largest such meditation hall in the world) near [[Gorai]], North-west of [[Mumbai]], [[India]]. The [[Pagoda]] was inaugurated by [[Pratibha Patil]],  then President of India on 8 February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1228804|title=Global Vipassana Pagoda inaugurated in Mumbai|publisher=[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]]|date=8 February 2009|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is  built on donated land on a peninsula between [[Gorai]] creek and the Arabian Sea. The pagoda is to serve as a monument of peace and harmony. The Global Vipassana Pagoda has been built out of gratitude to Sayagyi U Ba Khin (1899 - 1971), Vipassana teacher and the first Accountant-General of Independent Burma, who was instrumental in Vipassana returning to India, the country of its origin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vridhamma.org/en2005-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Built entirely through voluntary donations, the purpose of the Global Vipassana Pagoda is to: 1) share information about Vipassana, and 2) remove misconceptions about the Gotama the Buddha and his teachings. "The Buddha did not teach Buddhism. During his lifetime, he did not convert a single person to Buddhism", said the late Principal Vipassana Teacher S.N.Goenka (whose idea it was to build the Global Vipassana Pagoda), in his article 'Why the Vipassana Pagoda'."One will be surprised to hear this and will not want to believe it, because we have been hearing, speaking, reading and writing contrary to this fact for such a long time. But the historical truth is that the Buddha neither taught Buddhism nor made any person a Buddhist." Vipassana is the practical quintessence of the universal, non-sectarian teachings of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vridhamma.org/en1997-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Its traditional Burmese design is an expression of gratitude towards the country of Myanmar for preserving the practice of [[Vipassana]]. The shape of the pagoda is a copy of the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] (Golden Pagoda) in [[Yangon]], Myanmar. It was built combining ancient Indian and modern technology to enable it to last for a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gstf.in/papers/gstf2007/the_making_of_the_global_pagoda-mr.nayan_shah.wiz|title=Global Stone Technology Forum|accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1228804|title=Global Vipassana Pagoda inaugurated in Mumbai|publisher=[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]]|date=8 February 2009|accessdate= 9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Truly gold Global Vipassana Pagoda.jpg|thumb|left|View from the Arabian sea]]
[[File:Pagoda_at_Mumbai.jpg|thumb|Night view of main entrance]]
The center of the Global Vipassana Pagoda contains the world's largest stone dome built without any supporting pillars. The height of the dome is approximately 29 metres, while the height of the building is 96.12 meters, which is twice the size of the previously largest hollow stone monument in the world, the [[Gol Gumbaz]] Dome in [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]], India. The external diameter of the largest section of the dome is 97.46 m and the shorter sections is 94.82m. The internal diameter is 85.15 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpagoda.org/Default3.aspx?parentid=3&amp;levelid=18|title=Salient Features – Global Pagoda website|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inside of the pagoda is hollow and serves as a very large meditation hall with an area covering more than 6000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (65,000&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The massive inner dome seats over 8000 people enabling them to practice the non-sectarian Vipassana meditation as taught by [[S. N. Goenka]] and now being practiced in over 100 countries. An inaugural one-day meditation course was held at the pagoda on 21 December 2008, with Goenka in attendance as the teacher.

Ten-day vipassana meditation courses are held free of charge at the Dhamma Pattana meditation centre that is part of the Global Vipassana Pagoda complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pattana.dhamma.org/|title=Dhamma Pattana Vipassana Centre website|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction history==

===Timeline===
[[File:Global Vipassana Pagoda 1.jpg|thumb|left|Global Vipassana Pagoda under construction]]
[[File:Pagoda Meditators.jpg|thumb|Meditators seated inside the Global Pagoda dome.]]
Planning for the construction of the Global Vipassana Pagoda began in 1997, while actual building work started in 2000.
The pagoda consists of three sub-domes. The first and largest dome was completed in October 2006 when bone relics of [[Gotama Buddha]] were enshrined in the central locking stone of the dome on 29 October 2006, making it the world's largest structure containing relics of the Buddha. The relics were originally found in the stupa at [[Bhattiprolu]], Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, South India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpagoda.org/concept-and-planning Concept and Planning of Global Vipassana Pagoda | Global Vipassana Pagoda]. Globalpagoda.org. Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt; They have been donated by the Mahabodhi Society of India and the prime minister of Sri Lanka to be kept at the Global Vipassana Pagoda.&lt;ref&gt;Goenka, S.N.

Global Vipassana Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; The second and third domes sit atop the first dome. Construction of the third dome was structurally completed on 21 November 2008.

The Global Vipassana Pagoda complex is an evolving construction. A museum depicts the historical life and non-sectarian teaching of Gotama the Buddha. The Global Vipassana Pagoda's educational displays communicate the Buddha's teaching of the universal practice of Vipassana as a path towards real happiness.

The Global Vipassana Pagoda complex consists of the following structures:
*Pagoda dome containing relics of the Buddha. The pillar-less structure of the massive Pagoda dome encompasses a meditation hall to seat around 8,000 Vipassana meditators - the largest such meditation hall in the world.
*Vipassana meditation centre Dhamma Pattana 
*Museum depicting the historical life of the Buddha 
*Two smaller pagodas on the north and south side 
*Library and study rooms
*Circumambulation path around the dome 
*Administration building 
*Underground parkade
*Vipassana Research Institute office and facility for Pali study program
*Dhammalaya Guest House for Vipassana meditators

The south pagoda contains 108 meditation cells for use by Vipassana students taking a meditation course at the adjoining meditation centre.

===Construction materials===
[[File:Motif on Global Vipassana Pagoda.jpg|thumb|right|Motif on Global Vipassana Pagoda]]
The foundation of the dome consists of basalt, while the dome itself is made from sandstone brought from Rajasthan. The individual blocks of sandstone weigh 600–700&amp;nbsp;kg each and are kept in place due to the unique design of the bricks. Each of the bricks interlock with the ones adjacent to it and lime mortar is used to fill in any remaining gaps. The circumambulation path is laid in marble.

The pinnacle of the pagoda is adorned with a large crystal. The spire is covered in real gold, while the rest of the pagoda is covered in gold paint. The spire is topped with a special ornamental umbrella piece donated by the Burmese. The main doors to the pagoda are wooden and hand-carved in Myanmar (Burma).

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}

[[Buddhism]] was first actively disseminated in [[Tibet]] from the 7th to the 9th century CE, predominantly from India, but also influenced by [[Chinese Buddhism]]. During the ''Era of Fragmentation'' (9th–10th centuries), Buddhism waned in Tibet, only to rise again in the 11th century. With the Mongol invasion of Tibet in the 13th century and the establishment of the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]], Tibetan Buddhism spread beyond Tibet to Mongolia and China. From the 14th to the 20th Tibetan Buddhism was patronized by the Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) and the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912).

The Gelugpa school, founded by [[Je Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419), rose to (political) prominence under Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso (1617–1682), the [[5th Dalai Lama]], who invited the Mongols to intervene in the Tibetan civil war. The Mongols invested him with the political power of Tibet, leading to the dominanance of the Gelugpa until the 20th century. In the 19th century the [[Rimé movement]] provided a counter-weight against this dominance, trying to preserve the teachings of the [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Sakya]] schools.

In the early 20th century Tibet acquired ''de facto'' independence from China, which ended again with the Chinese invasion of 1950 and the ensuing exodus of Tibetans. Today, Tibetan Buddhism is still adhered to in the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and surrounding regions, while it has also attracted a considerable interest in the western world.

==Legendary origins (5th–7th centuries)==
According to tradition, in the reign of King [[Thothori Nyantsen]] (5th century),{{refn|group=note|On this date, see Richardson, Hugh: "The Origin of the Tibetan Kingdom", in: ''The History of Tibet'', ed. Alex McKay, Vol. 1, London 2003, p. 159. Traditional Tibetan sources state that this event occurred rather in 233.}} a basket of Buddhist scriptures arrived in Tibet from India.{{refn|group=note|According to a Tibetan legendary tradition, they fell from the sky and included ''[[Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra]]'': Studholme, Alexander: ''The Origins of Om Manipadme Hum'', Albany, NY 2002, pp. 13-14.}}

==First dissemination (7th–9th centuries)==
{{See also|Tibetan Empire}}

===Songtsän Gampo (7th century)===
Sanskrit Buddhist scriptures from Nepal &amp; India were first translated into Tibetan under the reign of the [[Tibet]]an king [[Songtsän Gampo]] (618-649),&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/e-books/unpublished_manuscripts/survey_tibetan_history/chapter_1.html: Berzin, Alexander, ''A Survey of Tibetan History'']&lt;/ref&gt; who established the Tibetan Empire. While there is doubt about the level of Songtsän Gampo's interest in Buddhism, it is known that he married a Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] Buddhist princess, [[Princess Wencheng|Wencheng]], who came to Tibet with a statue of Shakyamuni Buddha. It is clear from Tibetan sources that some of his successors became ardent Buddhists. The records show that [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhists]] were actively involved in missionary activity in Tibet, but they did not have the same level of imperial support as Indian Buddhists, with tantric lineages from Bihar and Bengal.&lt;ref name="Powers39"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Tibetan legendary tradition, Songtsän Gampo also married a [[Nepalis|Nepalese]] Buddhist princess, [[Bhrikuti]]. By the second half of the 8th century he was already regarded as an embodiment of the Bodhisattva [[Avalokiteśvara]].&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, Alexander: ''Religion in Tibet at the time of Srong-btsan sgam-po: myth as history'', in: ''The History of Tibet'', ed. Alex McKay, Vol. 1, London 2003, p. 354-363 (for the queens see p. 355); Dargyay, Eva: ''Srong-btsan sgam-po of Tibet: Bodhisattva and king'', in: ''The History of Tibet'', ed. Alex McKay, Vol. 1, London 2003, p. 364-378 (for the queens see p. 373).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian and Nepalese influences (8th century)===
[[Image:Guru Rinpoche - Padmasambhava statue.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Padmasambhava|Padmasambhāva]], founder of the [[Nyingmapa]], the earliest school of Tibetan Buddhism; note the wide-open eyes, characteristic of a particular method of meditation&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 1999: 183.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the 8th century Buddhism really took hold in Tibet.{{sfn|Conze|1993}}{{refn|group=note|For more detail, see: Alexander Berzin, [https://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/history-culture/buddhism-in-tibet/history-of-the-early-period-of-buddhism-bon-in-tibet ''History of the Early Period of Buddhism and Bon in Tibet'']}} The successors of Songtsän Gampo were less enthusiastic about the propagation of Buddhism, but in the 8th century King [[Trisong Detsen]] (755–797) established it as the official religion of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, C.I.: ''The revolt of 755 in Tibet'', in: ''The History of Tibet'', ed. Alex McKay, Vol. 1, London 2003, p. 273-285 (discusses the political background and the motives of the ruler).&lt;/ref&gt;

Trisong Detsen invited Indian Buddhist scholars to his court, and Tibetan Buddhists today trace their oldest spiritual roots to the Indian masters [[Padmasambhava|Padmasambhāva]] (8th century) and [[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788), who founded the [[Nyingma]], ''The Ancient Ones'', the oldest school of Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref name="StudyBuddhism.com"&gt;Berzin. Alexander (2000). ''How Did Tibetan Buddhism Develop?'': [http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/history-culture/buddhism-in-tibet/how-did-tibetan-buddhism-develop StudyBuddhism.com]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tibetan tradition, Padmasambhāva wrote a number of important scriptures, some of which he hid for future ''[[terton]]s'' to find; these [[Terma (religion)|Terma]] "treasures" (revealed texts) are of particular significance to the Nyingma school.

At this early time also, from the south came the influence of scholars under the [[Pala Empire|Pāla dynasty]] in the Indian state of Magadha. They had achieved a blend of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] and [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] that has come to characterize all forms of Tibetan Buddhism. Their teaching in sutra centered on the ''[[Abhisamayalankara|Abhisamayālankāra]]'', a 4th-century [[Yogacara|Yogācārin]] text, but prominent among them were the [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamika]] scholars [[Śāntarakṣita]] and [[Kamalaśīla]].

A third influence was that of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādins]] from Kashmir to the southwest&lt;ref&gt;Conze, 1993, 106&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Khotan]] to the northwest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/history-culture/buddhism-in-tibet/how-did-tibetan-buddhism-develop: Berzin, Alexander (2000). ''How Did Tibetan Buddhism Develop?'']; [http://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/about-buddhism/the-world-of-buddhism/spread-of-buddhism-in-asia: Berzin, Alexander (1996). ''The Spread of Buddhism in Asia'']&lt;/ref&gt; Although they did not succeed in maintaining a presence in Tibet, their texts found their way into the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon]], providing the Tibetans with almost all of their primary sources about what they regarded to be the [[Hinayana]]. A subsect of this school, [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]] was the source of the Tibetan [[vinaya]].&lt;ref&gt;Berzin, Alexander, as above&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese influences (8th century)===
The Chinese princess Jincheng Gongzhu ([[:zh:金城公主]]) (?–739), known in Tibet as Kim-sheng,{{refn|group=note|From Gyim shang Ong; also known as Kong-co}} and a devout Buddhist, was sent to Tibet in 710 where she married Mes-ag-tshoms.&lt;ref&gt;Wangdu and Diemberger (2000), pp. 33-34 and n. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; {{refn|group=note|He who would have been only six or seven years old at the time.}} Buddhist monks from [[Khotan]] (Li), fleeing the persecutions of an anti-Buddhist king, were given refuge by Kim-sheng about 737. Kim-sheng died during an outbreak of [[smallpox]] sometime between 739 and 741, and anti-Buddhist factions in Tibet began to blame the epidemic on the support of Buddhism by the king and queen.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Tibet'', p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; This forced the monks to flee once again; first to [[Gandhara]], and then to [[Kosambi]] in central India where the monks apparently ended up quarrelling and slaughtering each other.&lt;ref&gt;Hill (1988), pp. 179-180&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetan king ''[[Trisong Detsen]]'' (742–797) invited the [[Chinese Chán|Chan]] master [[Moheyan]]{{refn|group=note|和尚摩訶衍; his name consists of the same Chinese characters used to transliterate “[[Mahayana]]”) (Tibetan: ''Hwa shang Mahayana'')}} to transmit the Dharma at Samye Monastery. According to Tibetan sources, Moheyan lost the socalled [[council of Lhasa]] (793), a debate sponsored by Trisong Detsen on the nature of emptiness with the Indian master [[Kamalaśīla]], and the king declared [[Kamalaśīla]]s philosophy should form the basis for Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yzzj.fodian.net/BaoKu/FoDianWenInfo.aspx?ID=FW00000462 定解宝灯论新月释]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi, Zuihō (undated). ''The Core Elements of Indian Buddhism Introduced into Tibet: A Contrast with Japanese Buddhism.'' Source: [http://thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Miscellaneous/Indian_buddhism.pdf Thezensite.com] (accessed: October 20, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note| The whole incident was recorded in a book called "Le Concile de Lhasa" by French historian [[Paul Demieville]].}}{{refn|group=note|Kamalaśīla wrote the three [[Bhāvanākrama]] texts (修習次第三篇) after that.}} However, a Chinese source found in [[Dunhuang]] written by Mo-ho-yen says their side won, and some scholars conclude that the entire episode is fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hk.plm.org.cn/qikan/xdfx/5012-012A.htm 敦煌唐代写本顿悟大乘正理决]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (Volume One), page 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Pioneering Buddhologist [[Giuseppe Tucci]] speculated that Mohayen's ideas were preserved by the Nyingmapas in the form of [[dzogchen]] teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Masao Ichishima, "Sources of Tibetan Buddhist Meditation." Buddhist-Christian Studies, Vol. 2, (1982), pp. 121-122, published by University of Hawai'i Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to A. W. Barber of the University of Calgary,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/rels/barber A.W. Barber]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zen|Chan]] Buddhism was introduced to the [[Nyingmapa]] in three principal streams: the teachings of Korean Master Kim, [[Kim Ho-shang]], (Chin ho shang) 金和尚 transmitted by ''Sang Shi''&lt;ref&gt;''Sang Shi'' later became an abbot of [[Samye]] Monastery.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[circa|ca.]] 750 AD; the lineage of Master [[Wu Chu]] (無住禪師) of the Pao T'ang School was transmitted within Tibet by Ye-shes Wangpo; and the teaching from Mo-ho-yen, that were a synthesis of the Northern School of Chan and the Pao T'ang School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Barber | first=A.

According to Reynolds, "Except for a brief flirtation with Ch'an in the early days of Buddhism in Tibet in the eighth century, the Tibetans exhibited almost no interest at all in Chinese Buddhism, except for translating a few Sutras from Chinese for which they did not possess Indian originals."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, John. http://vajranatha.com/teaching/DzogchenChinese.htm (accessed: November 18, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Schaik emphasises that Chan and Dzogchen are based on two different classes of scripture, Chan being based on sutras, while Dzogchen being based on tantras.&lt;ref name="earlytibet.com"&gt;RSchaik, Sam van. http://earlytibet.com/2011/11/22/tibetan-chan-v/ (accessed: February 27, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Schaik further states "apparent similarities can be misleading."&lt;ref name="earlytibet.com"/&gt;}}

====Growth in Tibet (9th century)====
From the outset Buddhism was opposed by the native shamanistic [[Bön]] religion, which had the support of the aristocracy, but it thrived under royal patronage, reaching a peak under King Rälpachän (r. 817–836). Terminology in translation was standardised around 825, enabling a highly literal translation methodology.

==Era of fragmentation (9th–10th centuries)==
A reversal in Buddhist influence began under King Langdarma (r. 836–842), and his death was followed by the socalled ''Era of Fragmentation'', a period of Tibetan history in the 9th and 10th centuries. During this era, the political centralization of the earlier [[Tibetan Empire]] collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa. p.173.&lt;/ref&gt; The period was dominated by rebellions against the remnants of imperial Tibet and the rise of regional warlords.&lt;ref&gt;Schaik, Galambos. p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the death of [[Langdarma]], the last emperor of a unified Tibetan empire, a civil war ensued, which effectively ended centralized Tibetan administration until the Sa-skya period. Ösung's allies managed to keep control of Lhasa, and Yumtän was forced to go to Yalung, where he established a separate line of kings.&lt;ref&gt;Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa, ''Tibet, a Political History'' (New Haven:  Yale, 1967), 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tibetan Renaissance (10th–12th centuries)==
[[Image:Atisha.gif|right|thumb|Atiśa]]

The late 10th and 11th century saw a revival of Buddhism in Tibet. Coinciding with the early discoveries of "[[Terma (religion)|hidden treasures]]" (''terma''),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/study/comparison_buddhist_traditions/tibetan_traditions/four_traditions_tibetan_buddhism/transcript_1.html: Berzin, Alexander. ''The Four Traditions of Tibetan Buddhism: Personal Experience, History, and Comparisons'']&lt;/ref&gt; the 11th century saw a revival of Buddhist influence originating in the far east and far west of Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Conze, 1993, 104ff&lt;/ref&gt; In the west, [[Rinchen Zangpo]] (958-1055) was active as a translator and founded temples and monasteries. Prominent scholars and teachers were again invited from India.

In 1042 [[Atisha|Atiśa]] (982–1054 CE) arrived in Tibet at the invitation of a west Tibetan king. This renowned exponent of the Pāla form of Buddhism from the Indian university of [[Vikramashila]] later moved to central Tibet. There his chief disciple, Dromtonpa founded the [[Kadampa]] school of Tibetan Buddhism, under whose influence the [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|New Translation]] schools of today evolved.

The [[Sakya]], the ''Grey Earth'' school, was founded by Khön Könchok Gyelpo ({{bo|w='khon dkon mchog rgyal po}}, 1034–1102), a disciple of the great [[Lotsawa]], Drogmi Shākya ({{bo|w=brog mi lo tsā wa ye shes}}). It is headed by the [[Sakya Trizin]], traces its lineage to the [[mahasiddha]] Virūpa,&lt;ref name="StudyBuddhism.com"/&gt; and represents the scholarly tradition. A renowned exponent, [[Sakya Pandita]] (1182–1251CE), was the great-grandson of Khön Könchok Gyelpo.

Other seminal Indian teachers were [[Tilopa]] (988–1069) and his student [[Naropa]] (probably died ca. 1040 CE).The [[Kagyu]], the ''Lineage of the (Buddha's) Word'', is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was [[Milarepa]], an 11th-century mystic. It contains one major and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to the Indian master [[Naropa]] via [[Marpa Lotsawa]], Milarepa and [[Gampopa]]&lt;ref name="StudyBuddhism.com"/&gt;

==Mongol dominance (13th–14th centuries)==

===Initial influence on Mongolia (11th–13th centuries)===
Tibetan Buddhism exerted a strong influence from the 11th century CE among the peoples of [[Inner Asia]], especially the [[Mongols]]. Tantric-style Tibetan Buddhism was possibly first spread to the Mongols via the [[Tangut people|Tangut]] state of [[Western Xia]] (1038–1227).&lt;ref name="OrzechSørensen2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Orzech|author2=Henrik Sørensen|author3=Richard Payne|title=Esoteric Buddhism and the Tantras in East Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0XNX3N1a2AC&amp;pg=PA540&amp;dq=tangut+tantric+mongols&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAWoVChMI1Y2xs9m2xwIVxHA-Ch03pgDA#v=onepage&amp;q=tangut%20tantric%20mongols&amp;f=false|year=2011|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-18491-0|pages=540–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HeirmanBumbacher2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ann Heirman|author2=Stephan Peter Bumbacher|title=The Spread of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NuOvCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=tangut+tantric+mongols&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBGoVChMI1Y2xs9m2xwIVxHA-Ch03pgDA#v=onepage&amp;q=tangut%20tantric%20mongols&amp;f=false|date=11 May 2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-474-2006-4|pages=12–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhists entered the service of the [[Mongol Empire]] in the early 13th century. Buddhist monasteries established in [[Karakorum]] were granted tax exempt status, though the religion was not given official status by the [[Mongols]] until later.

===Mongol conquest of Tibet (13th century)===
The Mongols invaded Tibet in 1240.&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa. p.61: 'thirty thousand troops, under the command of Leje and Dorta, reached Phanpo, north of Lhasa.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanders. p. 309, ''his grandson Godan Khan invaded Tibet with 30000 men and destroyed several Buddhist monasteries north of Lhasa''&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongols withdrew their soldiers from Tibet in 1241, and returned to the region in 1244, when [[Godan Khan|Köten]] delivered an ultimatum, summoning the [[Sakya Pandita|abbot of Sakya]] (''Kun-dga' rGyal-mtshan'') to be his personal chaplain, on pains of a larger invasion were he to refuse.&lt;ref&gt;Buell, ibid. p.194: Shakabpa, 1967 pp.61-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Sakya Paṇḍita took almost 3 years to obey the summons and arrive in Kokonor in 1246, and met Prince Köten in [[Lanzhou]] the following year. The Mongols had annexed [[Amdo]] and [[Kham]] to the east, and appointed Sakya Paṇḍita Viceroy of Central Tibet by the Mongol court in 1249. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Tibet was incorporated into the Mongol Empire, retaining nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrative{{sfn|Wylie|1990|p=104}}&lt;ref&gt;"To counterbalance the political power of the lama, Khubilai appointed civil administrators at the Sa-skya to supervise the mongol regency."&lt;/ref&gt; rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention.

===Yuan dynasty (1271–1368)===
Tibetan Buddhism was adopted as the ''de facto'' [[state religion]] by the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368), founded by [[Kublai Khan]], that also ruled [[China]].&lt;ref name="Huntington_et_al"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|The Mongols may have been attracted to the Lamaist tradition and responded the way they did due to the Lamaist's superficial culture similarities with the Mongol's [[Shamanist]] culture. Even with this attraction, however, the Mongols "paid little attention to the fine points of Buddhist doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 142.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

All variants of Buddhism, such as [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese]], Tibetan and [[Indian Buddhism]] flourished, though Tibetan Buddhism was eventually favored at the imperial level under emperor [[Möngke Khan|Möngke]] (1209-1259), who appointed Namo from [[Kashmir]] as chief of all Buddhist monks. The top-level department and government agency known as the [[Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs]] (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in [[Khanbaliq]] (modern-day [[Beijing]]) to supervise [[Buddhist monk]]s throughout the empire. The [[Sakya]] [[Imperial Preceptor]]s were active at the Yuan court and enjoyed special power.&lt;ref&gt;History of civilizations of Central Asia.: A.D. 750 to the end of the fifteenth century. Part two : The achievements, p59&lt;/ref&gt; During this period Tibetan Buddhism was practiced not only within the capital Beijing and the [[Tibetan Plateau]], but throughout the country. For instance, [[Hangzhou]], capital of the former [[Southern Song dynasty]] and the largest city in the Yuan realm, became an important hub of the activities of Tibetan Buddhism, which took public or official precedence over [[Chinese Buddhism|Han Chinese Buddhism]]. Similarly, [[Mount Wutai]], the sacred site of [[Bodhisattva]] [[Manjusri]] and the holy mountain of Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, was greatly influenced by Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Esoteric Buddhism and the Tantras in East Asia, by Charles Orzech, Henrik Sørensen, Richard Payne, p548&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline of the Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate (13th–14th centuries)===
Among the ruling class of the Mongol khanates of the [[Golden Horde]] (1240s–1502) and the [[Ilkhanate]] (1256–1335/1353), the two western khanates of the [[Mongol Empire]], [[Shamanism]] and [[Buddhism]] were once the dominant religions, as in the Yuan dynasty. In the early days, the rulers of both khanates increasingly adopted Tibetan Buddhism, like the Yuan dynasty at that time. However, the Mongol rulers [[Ghazan]] of the Ilkhanate and [[Öz Beg Khan|Uzbeg]] of the Golden Horde converted to [[Islam]] in AD 1295 and AD 1313  respectively. The Yuan dynasty based in [[China]] and [[Mongolia]] became the only [[division of the Mongol Empire]] not to embrace Islam, instead favoring Tibetan Buddhism until its demise.

==Tibetan independence  (14th–18th centuries)==
With the decline of the Yuan dymansty, Central Tibet was to ruled by successive families from the 14th to the 17th century, and Tibet would be de facto independent from the mid-14th century on, for nearly 400 years.&lt;ref name="Rossabi194"&gt;Rossabi 1983, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family rule and establishment of Gelugpa school (14th–17th centuries)===
{{main article|Phagmodrupa Dynasty|Rinpungpa|Tsangpa}}

[[Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen|Jangchub Gyaltsän]] (Byang chub rgyal mtshan, 1302–1364) became the strongest political family in the mid 14th century. Military hostilities ended in 1354 with Jangchub Gyaltsän as the unquestioned victor, who established the [[Phagmodrupa Dynasty]] in that year. He continued to rule central Tibet until his death in 1364, although he left all Mongol institutions in place as hollow formalities. Power remained in the hands of the Phagmodru family until 1434.&lt;ref&gt;Petech, L. ''Central Tibet and The Mongols''. (Serie Orientale Roma 65). Rome: Instituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente 1990:  85–143&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule of Jangchub Gyaltsän and his successors implied a new cultural self-awareness where models were sought in the age of the ancient [[Tibetan Kingdom]]. The relatively peaceful conditions favoured the literary and artistic development.&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik, S. ''Tibet. A History''. New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press 2011: 88–112.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the reformist scholar [[Je Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419) founded the [[Gelug]] sect which would have a decisive influence on Tibet's history.

Internal strife within the Phagmodrupa dynasty, and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions, led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family [[Rinpungpa]], based in [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]] (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435.

In 1565 the Rinpungpa family was overthrown by the [[Tsangpa]] Dynasty of [[Shigatse]] which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the [[Karma Kagyu]] sect. They would play a pivotal role in the events which led to the rise of power of the Dalai Lama's in the 1640s.

===Ming patronage===
{{Main|Ming dynasty}}

====Tibet====
In spite of the weakening of central authority, the neighbouring Ming Dynasty of China (1368–1644) made little effort to impose direct rule, although it had nominal claims of the Tibetan territory by establishing the U-Tsang Regional Military Commission and Do-Kham Regional Military Commission in the 1370s. Tibetan Buddhism was patronized by the ethnic-Chinese Ming dynasty  that succeeded the Yuan,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/documents/readings/robinson_culture_courtiers_ch.8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sav.sk/journals/uploads/040214374_Slobodn%C3%ADk.pdf p 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and kept friendly relations with some of the Buddhism religious leaders known as Princes of Dharma and granted some other titles to local leaders including the Grand Imperial Tutor.&lt;ref&gt;Tucci, G. ''Tibetan Painted Scrolls'', Vol. 1-2. Rome 1949, Vol. 1: 692-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Zhang Tingyu|Zhang, T.]] ''[[History of Ming]]''-Geography III&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mongolia====
The Ming dynasty (1368–1644) rulers deliberately helped propagate Tibetan Buddhism instead of Chinese Buddhism among the Mongols. During the early period of the [[Northern Yuan dynasty]] (1368-ca.1636), shamanism once again became the sole dominant religion in [[Mongolia]], but the last sixty years before the death of the last khan [[Ligdan Khan]] (1588-1643) were marked by intensive penetration of Tibetan Buddhism into Mongolian society. In 1578, [[3rd Dalai Lama|Sonam Gyatso]] was invited to Mongolia and converted Altan Khan to Buddhism along with his tribe (the first Mongol tribe to be so converted). Altan Khan conferred the title "Dalai" on him, "Dalai" being the Mongolian translation of his Tibetan name "[[Gyatso]]", which means "sea" or "ocean".&lt;ref&gt;McKay 2003, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; This is the origin of the title [[Dalai Lama]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The Ming assisted [[Altan Khan]] (1507–1582), King of the [[Tumed|Tümed Mongols]], when he requested aid in propagating Lamaism.&lt;ref name="Taveirne2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Taveirne|title=Han-Mongol Encounters and Missionary Endeavors: A History of Scheut in Ordos (Hetao) 1874-1911|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z2japTNPRNAC&amp;pg=PA67|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Leuven University Press|isbn=978-90-5867-365-7|pages=67–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within 50 years nearly all the Mongols had become Buddhists, including tens of thousands of monks, almost all followers of the [[Gelug]] school and loyal to the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref&gt;Laird, Thomas (2006). ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama'', p. 144. Grove Press, N.Y. {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1827-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Tibetan Buddhism has played a very important role among the Mongols.

Tibetan Buddhism was the most important religion among the [[Mongolia under Qing rule|Mongols under Qing rule]] (1635–1912), as well as the state religion of the [[Kalmyk Khanate]] (1630–1771), the [[Dzungar Khanate]] (1634–1758) and the [[Khoshut Khanate]] (1642–1717). Tibetan Buddhism was also adored by the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] court (1644–1912) since both Mongols and Tibetans believed in Tibetan Buddhism.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Some historians view the promotion of Lamaist Buddhism among the Mongols by the Ming and Qing as a deliberate plot to weaken the Mongol's military prowess, but others reject the theory.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Ganden Phodrang government  (17th–18th centuries)===
{{Main article|Ganden Phodrang}}

The ''Ganden Phodrang'' was the Tibetan regime or government that was established by the 5th Dalai Lama with the help of the Güshi Khan of the Khoshut in 1642. After the civil war in the 17th century and the Mongol intervention, the Gelugpa school dominated Tibetan Buddhism, and successive Dalai Lamas ruled [[Tibet]] from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries.

====Beginnings of the Dalai Lama lineage====
{{Main article|Dalai Lama}}

The rise of the Dalai Lama's was intimately connected with the military power of Mongolian clans. [[Altan Khan]], the king of the [[Tümed]] [[Mongols]], first invited [[Sonam Gyatso, 3rd Dalai Lama|Sonam Gyatso]], the head of the [[Gelugpa]] school of Tibetan Buddhism (later known as the third Dalai Lama), to [[Mongolia]] in 1569 and again in 1578, during the reign of the Tsangpa family. Gyatso accepted the second invitation. They met at the site of Altan Khan's new capital, Koko Khotan (Hohhot), and the Dalai Lama taught a huge crowd there.

Sonam Gyatso publicly announced that he was a reincarnation of the Tibetan [[Sakya]] monk [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]] (1235–1280) who converted Kublai Khan, while Altan Khan was a reincarnation of Kublai Khan (1215–1294), the famous ruler of the Mongols and Emperor of China, and that they had come together again to cooperate in propagating the Buddhist religion.{{sfn|Laird|2006|p=145}} While this did not immediately lead to a massive conversion of Mongols to Buddhism (this would only happen in the 1630s), it did lead to the widespread use of Buddhist ideology for the legitimation of power among the Mongol nobility. Last but not least, [[Yonten Gyatso]], the fourth Dalai Lama, was a grandson of Altan Khan.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Weiers, ''Geschichte der Mongolen'', Stuttgart 2004, p. 175ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rise and dominance of Gelugpa (17th–18th centuries)====
[[Sonam Choephel]] (1595–1657 CE), the first regent of the [[fifth Dalai Lama]], was "the prime architect of the [[Gelug]]'s rise to power".&lt;ref name=IIAS&gt;{{cite web|last=Karmay|first=Samten G.|title=The Great Fifth|url=http://www.iias.nl/nl/39/IIAS_NL39_1213.pdf|work=IIAS Newsletter Number 39|publisher=International Institute for Asian Studies|accessdate=25 January 2013|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|pages=12, 13|format = PDF|date=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonam Choephel requested the aid of [[Güshi Khan]], a powerful [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] military leader to end decades of clan-wars in Dbus and Gtsang privinces, and the Tibetan civil war of 1639-1642.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald M. Davidson, ''Tibet''. In: Robert M. Buswell (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', p.856&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IIAS" /&gt; [[Güshi Khan]] (who was head of the [[Khoshut]] tribe) conquered [[Kham]] in 1640 bringing the [[Sakya]]s and the lords of Kham and [[Amdo]] under their control.  His victory over [[Karma Tenkyong]], the prince of [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]] in [[Shigatse]], in 1642, completed the military unification of the country and the establishment of the [[Khoshut Khanate]]. By this feat the [[Phagmodrupa Dynasty]], which was associated with a variant of the [[Kagyu]] school, was technically replaced; in actual fact it had been powerless for many years. By subsequently formally recognizing the Fifth Dalai Lama's authority in 1642, [[Güshi Khan]] effectively made Gyatso the temporal ruler of all Tibet.&lt;ref name="IIAS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laird, Thomas.

''Tibet and its History''. Second Edition, Revised and Updated, p. 42. Shambhala. Boston &amp; London. {{ISBN|0-87773-376-7}}.(pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qing rule (18th–20th centuries)==

===Establishment of Qing rule===
The [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) established their rule over Tibet after a [[Chinese expedition to Tibet (1720)|Qing expedition force]] defeated the [[Dzungar people|Dzungars]] in 1720, and lasted until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912. The Qing emperors appointed imperial residents known as the [[Amban]]s to Tibet, who commanded over 2,000 troops stationed in [[Lhasa]] and reported to the [[Lifan Yuan]], a Qing government agency that oversaw the region during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Emblems of Empire: Selections from the Mactaggart Art Collection, by John E. Vollmer, Jacqueline Simcox, p154&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of the Manchu Qing dynasty supported Tibetan Buddhism, especially the [[Gelug]] sect, for most of their dynasty.&lt;ref name="Huntington_et_al"&gt;The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art, by John C. Huntington, Dina Bangdel, Robert A. F. Thurman, p48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rimé movement (19th century)===
{{Main|Rimé movement}}

The Rimé movement was a movement involving the [[Sakya]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], along with some [[Bon]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Donald S. (1998). ''Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Having seen how the [[Gelug]] institutions pushed the other traditions into the corners of Tibet's cultural life, [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo]] (1820–1892) and [[Jamgon Kongtrul|Jamgön Kongtrül]] (1813–1899) compiled together the teachings of the [[Sakya]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]], including many near-extinct teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Schaik, Sam van. ''Tibet: A History''. Yale University Press 2011, page 165-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Without Khyentse and Kongtrul's collecting and printing of rare works, the suppression of Buddhism by the Communists would have been much more final.&lt;ref&gt;Schaik, Sam van. ''Tibet: A History''. Yale University Press 2011, page 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rimé movement is responsible for a number of scriptural compilations, such as the ''[[Nyingma#Rinchen Terdzod|Rinchen Terdzod]]'' and the ''[[Sheja Dzö]]''.

==Modern history (20th–21st centuries)==

===20th century – de facto independence, Chinese occupation, and Tibetan exodus===
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}

In 1912 Tibet became de facto independent again, but was annexed by the Chinese People's republic in 1950. In 1959 the 14th Dalai Lama and a great number of clergy fled the country, to settle in India and other neighbouring countries. This also started the spread of Tibetan Buddhism to western countries, resulting in worldwide communities of Tibetan Buddhism.

===21st century – exile and spread abroad===
Today, Tibetan Buddhism is adhered to widely in the [[Tibetan Plateau]], [[Mongolia]], northern [[Nepal]], [[Kalmykia]] (on the north-west shore of the Caspian), [[Siberia]]  ([[Tuva]] and [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]]), the [[Russian Far East]] and northeast China. It is the [[state religion]] of [[Buddhism in Bhutan|Bhutan]].&lt;ref&gt;The 2007 U.S. State Department report on religious freedom in Bhutan notes that "Mahayana Buddhism is the state religion..." and that the Bhutanese government supports both the Kagyu and Nyingma sects. [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90227.htm State.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian regions of [[Sikkim]] and [[Ladakh]], both formerly independent kingdoms, are also home to significant Tibetan Buddhist populations, as are the Indian states of [[Himachal Pradesh]] (which includes [[Dharamshala]] and the district of Lahaul-Spiti), [[West Bengal]] (the hill stations of [[Darjeeling]] and [[Kalimpong]]) and [[Arunachal Pradesh]].

In the wake of the [[Tibetan diaspora]], Tibetan Buddhism has gained adherents in the West and throughout the world. Fully ordained Tibetan Buddhist Monks now work in academia (for example Ven. Alex Bruce ('Tenpa')).&lt;ref&gt;Bruce A (ed). One World – Many Paths to Peace ANU E-Press 2009 (launched by the 14th Dalai Lama) http://eview.anu.edu.au/one_world/index.php (accessed 11 May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[14th Dalai Lama]], Tenzin Gyatso, has traveled the world and spoken about the welfare of Tibetans, [[environmental quality|environment]], [[economics]], [[women's rights]], [[non-violence]], [[interfaith dialogue]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[Buddhism and science]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[reproductive health]], and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], along with various [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] topics. He received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1989.

{{About|Holy Doors in the Roman Catholic tradition|holy doors in the Eastern Orthodox or Greek-Catholic traditions|Royal doors}}
[[File:Rom, Vatikan, Petersdom - Heilige Pforte 1.jpg|thumb|The Holy Door by [[Vico Consorti]], cast by [[Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry]] of [[Florence]], is the northernmost entrance of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in the Vatican. It is cemented shut and only opened for Jubilee Years.]]
[[File:Holy-door-rear.jpg|thumb|right|Rear of the Holy Door. Contained inside are several medals and canonical documents from the Pontificate during which the door was last opened. Following the end of the  [[Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy]], the door is now sealed.]]
A '''Holy Door''' ({{lang-la|Porta Sancta}}) is traditionally an entrance portal located within the [[Pope|Papal]] [[major basilica]]s in [[Rome]]. The doors are normally sealed by mortar and cement from the inside so that they cannot be opened. They are ceremoniously opened during [[Jubilee (Christian)|Jubilee]] years designated by the Pope, for pilgrims who enter through those doors may piously gain the [[plenary indulgence]]s attached with the Jubilee year celebrations.

In October 2015, [[Pope Francis]] broke with tradition in having each [[Roman Catholic]] [[Diocese#Catholic_Church|diocese]] throughout the world designate one or more local Holy Doors during the [[Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy]], so that Catholics could gain the plenary indulgences granted during the Jubilee year without having to travel to Rome.

==History==
[[Pope Boniface VIII]] began the tradition of the Holy Year, known as a Jubilee, in 1300 and the Catholic Church has celebrated them every 25 years or so ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stpetersbasilica.info/Interior/HolyDoor/HolyDoor.htm "The Holy Door", Stpetersbasilica.info]&lt;/ref&gt; A major part of the Holy Year for Catholics is a pilgrimage to Rome and the ritual passing over the threshold of the holy door to symbolise the passing into the presence of God. At the same time, remission of the temporal punishment for the pilgrims' sins is granted, known as an indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholicstraightanswers.com/what-is-the-significance-of-the-holy-door/ Saunders, William P., "What is the significance of the Holy Door?", Catholic Straight Answers]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest accounts of the Holy Year dates back to a Spanish historian, traveler and pilgrim called [[Pedro Tafur]] in 1437. Tafur connects the Jubilee indulgence with the right of [[sanctuary]] for those who had escaped persecution. He also noted its existence in pagan times for all who crossed the threshold of the ''Puerta Tarpea'' previously upon the site of the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]]. Accordingly, at the request of [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Emperor Constantine I]], [[Pope Sylvester I]] published a [[Papal Bull]] proclaiming the same immunity from punishment for Christian sinners who took sanctuary there. The privilege, however, was quickly abused and at some point was even commercialised resulting in popes consequently ordering the door to be sealed with a wall, only to be unsealed during Jubilee years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleteia.org/2015/11/30/when-is-a-door-not-a-door-when-its-a-holy-door/ McDonald, Thomas L., "When is a Door Not Just a Door?", ''Aleteia'', November 30, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The wall was destroyed and the door opened once in a hundred years. This was later reduced to fifty years and now "opened at the will of the Pope." &lt;ref name=Thurston&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08531c.htm Thurston, Herbert. "Holy Year of Jubilee." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 13 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1450, the [[Florence|Florentine]] merchant Giovanni Rucellai of [[Viterbo]] cites that the first Jubilee door was opened in 1423 under the pontificate of [[Pope Martin V]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/documents/ns_lit_doc_14121999_porta-santa_en.html Marini, Piero. "The Opening of the Holy Door", Vatican News Service, December 1, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rucellai, who lived at the time also speaks of the five doors of the Lateran basilica:

{{quote|One of which is always walled up except during the Jubilee year, when it is broken down at Christmas when the Jubilee commences.  The devotion which the populace has for the bricks and mortar of which it is composed is such that at the unwalling, the fragments are immediately carried off by the crowd, and the foreigners take them home as so many sacred [[relic]]s… Out of devotion every one who gains the indulgence passes through that door, which is walled up again as soon as the Jubilee is ended.&lt;ref name=Thurston/&gt;}}

[[Pope Alexander VI]] expanded the rite of the Jubilee year of 1500 by opening other doors in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]], [[Basilica of Saint Mary Major]] and the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]]. This jubilee year began on [[Christmas day]] and ended on the [[Feast of the Epiphany]] 1501.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/documents/ns_lit_doc_20010106_chiusura_en.html Marini, Piero., "The Holy Door Closes", Vatican News Service, December 20, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of [[Pope John VII]] the holy doors were opened every 33 years, reflecting the number of years attributed to the lifespan of [[Jesus Christ]]. This was later amended to 50 years in commemoration of the [[Hebrew]] custom of [[Jubilee (biblical)|Jubilees]] and later changed to a [[centenary]] or at any time at the will of the reigning [[Pontiff]].
[[File:Scuola romana, medaglia di gregorio XIII, 1575, giubileo, porta santa.JPG|thumb|Jubilee commemorative medal of Gregory XIII, 1575]]
Between 1500 and 1974, the entrance portal was barricaded by a solid wall, not an actual door. The popes themselves began the ritual destruction of these walls followed by masons who completed the actual task demolishing it. This describes a rite that has nearly always supplied the principal subject depicted upon the long series of Jubilee medals issued by the numerous Popes who have opened and closed the holy door at the beginning and end of each Jubilee year. Each of the four basilicas has its own holy door.&lt;ref name=Thurston/&gt;

After closing the Holy Year on Christmas day 1950 [[Pope Pius XII]] replaced the wooden doors installed by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1748, which had begun to fall into disrepair, with the 16-panelled [[bronze]] doors (carved by [[Vico Consorti]] and cast by [[Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry]]) that are seen today.

==Symbolism==
[[File:Santa Maria Maggiore BW 4.JPG|thumb|The Holy Door at St. Mary Major]]
In John 10:9, Jesus is quoted as saying, "I am the gate. Whoever enters through me will be saved."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostoncatholic.org/Offices-And-Services/Office-Detail.aspx?id=31890&amp;pid=31886 Gsapar, Jonathan. "Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy", Archdiocese of Boston]&lt;/ref&gt; In Luke 11:9 is found, ""And I tell you, ask and you will receive; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you." Revelations 3:20 says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, (then) I will enter his house and dine with him, and he with me." Dom Albert Hammenstede O.S.B. noted that [[Ostiarius|Porter]] was one of the [[minor orders]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=3295 Hammenstede, Dom Albert, O.S.B., "On the Symbolism of Holy Doors"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Thurston]] suggests that "the symbolism of this ceremony  may also have been influenced by the old idea of seeking sanctuary."&lt;ref name=Thurston/&gt;

In the papal bull, ''Incarnationis mysterium'' of November 29, 1998 [[Pope John Paul II]] formally announced the [[Great Jubilee]] of 2000 saying that the Holy Door ""evokes the passage from sin to grace".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archgh.org/yearofmercy/holydoors/ "Holy Doors in the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston]&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy Door represents "a ritual expression of conversion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdxmercy.org/the-holy-doors The Holy Doors in the Archdiocese of Portland, Oregon]&lt;/ref&gt;

"A Holy Door ...is a visual symbol of internal renewal, which begins with the willing desire to make peace with God, reconcile with your neighbors, restore in yourself everything that has been damaged in the past, and reshape your heart through conversion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctuairesquebec.com/en/notre-dame-de-quebec-basilica-cathedral/sanctuaire/holy-door "What is a Holy Door?", Notre-Dame de Quebec Basilica Cathedral]&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the Second Vatican Council==
In 1975, [[Pope Paul VI]], in light of the modernising changes of the [[Second Vatican Council]] revised the rite by removing the use of [[trowel]] and ornate bricks at the closing rite.

[[Pope John Paul II]] further simplified the ceremony for the Great Jubilee of 2000 for safety reasons; previously, debris had fallen on [[Pope Paul VI]] while striking down the door. Workers had removed the concrete before the ceremony of the opening of the door so that the Pope only had to push on the doors with his hands. The holy door of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] was opened by the Pope on 24 December 1999 while the doors of [[Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano|St. John Lateran]] and [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|St. Mary Major]] were opened on 25 December and 1 January, respectively. Breaking with tradition, the Pope opened both of these personally, rather than delegating this to a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]. The doors of [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]] were opened in an [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] ceremony on 18 January, first day of the World Week of Prayer for Christian Unity by the Pope, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and a representative of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]]. The door in St. Peter's was closed on 6 January 2001, with the others being closed one day earlier.

Until the [[Great Jubilee]] of 2000, the Pope knocked upon the door three times with a silver hammer, singing the versicle "Open unto me the gates of justice". Above the holy door in St. Peter's are marble memorial plates commemorating the last two times that the door has been opened. Since John Paul II held the last two Jubilees, both plates indicate that he opened and closed the door.

==Holy Year of Mercy==

In announcing the [[Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy]] Pope Francis declared, "The Holy Door will become a Door of Mercy through which anyone who enters will experience the love of God who consoles, pardons, and instills hope."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.im.va/content/gdm/en/giubileo/bolla.html Pope Francis, "Misericordiae Vultus" §3, April 11, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 8, 2015, Pope Francis opened the Holy Door of Mercy in the Basilica of St. Peter, marking the official start of the Jubilee Year of Mercy. A few days later, he presided at the opening of the Holy Door at the Archbasilica of St John Lateran. The Holy Door at St Paul’s “Outside-the-Walls” was opened by the Archpriest of that Basilica, Cardinal James Harvey. Pope Francis later opened the Holy Door at St Mary Major and at the Caritas center near Rome’s central train station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-francis-opens-holy-door-at-st-mary-major "Pope Francis opens Holy Door at St Mary Major", News.va, January 1, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis broke with tradition in removing the necessity of traveling to Rome.&lt;ref name=vogt/&gt; In October 2015, a temporal privilege was extended by Pope Francis through the [[Papal bull]] of Indiction, "''Misericordiae Vultus''"  for an ordinary bishop to designate his own Holy Door for the purpose of the "Jubilee Year of Mercy". Holy Doors were to be designated in every diocese throughout the world, and could be located at the diocesan [[Cathedral]] or at other popular church shrines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/news/hf/faith/story.php?id=65469 Harris, Elise. "Holy Door in St. Peter's basilica to open for first time in 15 years for Holy Year of Mercy", Catholic.org, November 20, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; On November 29, 2015, prior to the official December 8 start of the Jubilee Year of Mercy, Pope Francis opened the Holy Door at the [[Cathédrale Notre-Dame (Bangui)|Cathédrale Notre-Dame]] in [[Bangui]], [[Central African Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/11/29/pope_opens_holy_door_at_mass_in_bangui_cathedral/1190630 "Pope opens Holy Door at Mass in Bangui cathedral", Radiovaticana.va, November 29, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Holy Doors were subsequently opened in 40 different countries around the world, including locations such as [[Westminster Cathedral]], [[Prinknash Abbey]] in Gloucestershire,&lt;ref name=vogt&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/12048539/Cathedrals-around-world-throw-open-Holy-Doors-on-orders-of-Pope.html Vogt, Andrea.

'''Howard Adelman''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|CM}} (b     orn January 7, 1938) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[philosopher]] and former university professor. He retired as Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at [[York University]] in 2003. Adelman was one of the founders of [[Rochdale College]], as well as the founder and director of York's Centre for Refugee Studies. He was editor of ''[[Refuge (journal)|Refuge]]'' for ten years, and since his retirement he has received several honorary university and governmental appointments in Canada and abroad. Adelman was the recipient of numerous awards and grants, and presented the inaugural lecture in a series named in his honor at York University in 2008.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Howard Adelman was born January 7, 1938, in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name="Who"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lumley|first=Elizabeth |title=Canadian Who’s Who 1997|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a B.A. (1960), M.A. (1963), and Ph.D. (1971) in philosophy from the [[University of Toronto]], and was a member of the faculty at York University in Toronto from 1966 until his retirement in 2003. As a nineteen-year-old philosophy student, Adelman was hired in 1958 by the Campus Co-operative to meet a growing need for student housing at the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;Mietkiewicz and Mackowycz 1988, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; With Adelman's advice, Campus Co-op acquired additional properties and formed Co-operative College Residences Inc., a non-profit offshoot. Later, while a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Toronto (1963–1964) and assistant professor at York University (1966–1970), Adelman was one of the principal founders of [[Rochdale College]], an experimental "free university" organized on the cooperative principle of its British namesake. After obtaining federal mortgages at well below market rates, Campus Co-op incorporated Rochdale College in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Mietkiewicz and Mackowycz 1988, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; An energetic and entrepreneurial spirit with boundless imagination and a playful sense of humor, at that time Adelman was prone to saying he "teaches at the University of Toronto and studies at Rochdale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adelman|first=Howard|author2=Lee, Dennis|title=The University Game|publisher=House of Anansi Press|location=Toronto|year=1968|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adelman was the founder and director of York's Centre for Refugee Studies (1988–1993) and for ten years he was editor of Canada's periodical on refugees, ''[[Refuge (journal)|Refuge]]'' until 1993.&lt;ref name="Who"/&gt;

===Service and recognition===
Adelman served in many university positions at York University, including acting dean of Atkinson College, two terms as director of the graduate program in philosophy, and chair of the Department of Philosophy at York University. He served as Vice-Chair, York University Senate (1980–81), and as its Chair (1981–82). Adelman served as National Chair of Canadian Professors for Peace in the Middle East (1983–84), and Director of the Refugee Documentation Project (1982–86).&lt;ref name="CRS20"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorku.ca/yfile/archive/index.asp?Article=10243|title=Howard Adelman Lecture to celebrate CRS's 20th anniversary|date=3 April 2008|work=Y File|publisher=York University|location=Toronto|accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Adelman was honored as the keynote speaker at the First Annual Howard Adelman Lecture in celebration of the Centre for Refugee Studies’ 20th anniversary. Held during Refugee Rights Week in Toronto, Adelman reviewed recent research on refugees, suggesting it is probably more beneficial than detrimental to assist refugees.&lt;ref name="CRS20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, Howard, "Does Research on Refugees Help Refugees?" Refugee Rights Week. York University Centre for Refugees, Toronto, Ontario, April 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-retirement===
After retiring in 2003, Adelman was appointed visiting professor at the [[Woodrow Wilson School]] at [[Princeton University]] in 2004. In 2008, Adelman is senior research fellow at the Key Centre for Ethics, Law, Justice and Governance at [[Griffith University]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]. He serves as the deputy convener of GovNet, a consortium of researchers on governance issues in Australia, and as research director of the International Consortium of Research on Governance of the Health Workforce. He is producer and host of a weekly television program, Israel Today, broadcast in Canada and parts of the United States.&lt;ref name="CRS20"/&gt;

In December 2016, Adelman was named a [[Member of the Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/order-canada-newest-appointees-2016-150-1.3916634 "Order of Canada's newest appointees include Paralympian, Supreme Court judge and astrophysicist"]. [[CBC News]], December 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
The author, coauthor or editor of 23 scholarly books and over 100 articles and book chapters, in addition to numerous other papers, addresses, and professional reports, Adelman has written extensively on the Middle East, humanitarian intervention, membership rights, ethics, early warning and conflict management, refugee repatriation, policy and resettlement, including his contribution in 2000 to the Institutional Component of the Early Warning and Conflict Management System set up by IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) for the Horn of Africa.&lt;ref name="CRS20"/&gt;

Perhaps best known for his work in applied philosophy concerning [[refugees]], [[immigration policy]] and [[genocide]], Adelman published a major study entitled ''Early Warning and Conflict Management: Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance to Rwanda'' (1996) as part of the 5 volume study ''International Response to Conflict and Genocide: Lessons from the Rwanda Experience''. In 1999, he co-edited ''The Path of a Genocide: The Rwanda Crisis from Uganda to Zaire'', already regarded a classic on the subject. Adelman served as an associate editor for the Macmillan three-volume ''Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity'' (2005). These efforts earned international acclaim.&lt;ref name="CRS20"/&gt;

His earlier works included publications on social criticism and reform of universities, including ''The University Game'', co-edited with [[Dennis Lee (author)|Dennis Lee]] (1968), ''The Beds of Academe'' (1970), and ''The Holiversity'' (1973).

This four-[[kanji|character]] compound (or [[yojijukugo]]) literally translates as "what the mind thinks, the heart transmits".  Sometimes translated into English as "[[telepathy]]" or "[[sympathy]]", ''ishin-denshin'' is also commonly rendered as "[[Heart (symbolism)|heart]]-to-heart communication" or "[[Tacit knowledge|tacit understanding]]".&lt;ref name="Cheung1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheung|first=King-Kok|title=Articulate Silences: Hisaye Yamamoto, Maxine Hong Kingston, Joy Kogawa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0DrUokTlmgC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=29 July 2012|year=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8147-5|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although silent understanding is generally recognized as a universal human phenomenon, the term ''ishin-denshin'' is often used to convey a style of [[nonverbal communication]] between two people that is felt by some Japanese to be characteristic of [[Japanese culture]].&lt;ref name="DaviesIkeno2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Roger J. |last2=Ikeno|first2=Osamu|title=The Japanese Mind: Understanding Contemporary Japanese Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TW7lHYwXhS4C&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=July 28, 2012|date=March 15, 2002|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-0-8048-3295-3|pages=52–54, 105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Takeo Doi]],The Anatomy of Self,1985,page138(...telepathic,pre-linguistic,...)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John W.Dower,War without Mercy,1986,page107(...nondiscursive communication...)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karel van Wolferen,The Enigma of Japanese Power,1989,page327(...supra-conversational...)&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the Japanese concept of ''[[haragei]]'' denotes a deliberate form of nonverbal communication, ''ishin-denshin'' refers to a passive form of shared understanding.  ''Ishin-denshin'' is traditionally perceived by the Japanese as sincere, silent communication via the heart or belly (i.e. symbolically from the inside, ''[[Uchi-soto|uchi]]''), as distinct from overt communication via the face and mouth (the outside, ''soto''), which is seen as being more susceptible to insincerities.&lt;ref name="DaviesIkeno2002"/&gt; The introduction of this concept to Japan (via China) is related to the traditions of [[Zen Buddhism]], where the term ''ishin-denshin'' refers to direct [[Dharma transmission|mind transmission]].&lt;ref name="DaviesIkeno2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baroni2002"&gt;{{cite book|last= Baroni|first=Helen Josephine |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smNM4ElP3XgC&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=July 28, 2012|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-2240-6|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zen Buddhism]] tradition, in turn, draws the concept of ''ishin-denshin'' from the first [[Dharma transmission]] between [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Mahākāśyapa]] in the [[Flower Sermon]].&lt;ref name="Shores1998"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/JeffShore.pdf |title=THE SOURCE OF ZEN: WHO TRANSMITS WHAT? |last1=Shore |first1=Jeff |date=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Durix1991"&gt;{{cite book |last=Durix |first=Claude |date=1991 |title=Cent Clés pour Comprendre le Zen |publisher=Le Courrier du Livre |page=43 |isbn=2-7029-0261-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Rest''' was an American psychologist specializing in [[moral psychology]] and development. Together with his Minnesota Group of colleagues, including [[Darcia Narvaez]], Muriel Bebeau, and Stephen Thoma, Rest extended [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]]'s approach to researching moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rest, J.R., Narvaez, D., Bebeau, M. &amp; Thoma, S.|title=Postconventional Moral Thinking: A Neo-Kohlbergian Approach|year=1999|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahweh, New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Rest was a professor at the University of Minnesota from 1970 until his formal retirement in 1994 and was a 1993 recipient of the Distinguished Teaching Award at the University. Rest continued mentoring, researching, and writing until his death in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Her|first=Lucy Y.|title=Obituaries: James R. Rest, 58, professor|newspaper=Minneapolis Star Tribune|date=20 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rest's and the Neo-Kohlbergians' work included the [[Defining Issues Test]] (DIT), which attempts to provide an objective measure of moral development, and the [[Four Component Model]] of moral development, which attempts to provide a theoretical perspective on the subject.  Rest and the Minnesota Group were unusually open to other approaches, new research, criticisms, and integrating their Neo-Kohlbergian approach with others.

==Reception==
There have been extensive criticisms of Rest's work in general and the DIT in particular.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Testing by independent sources has tended to uphold the strength and validity of the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pascarella &amp; Terenzini|first=E.T. &amp; P.|title=How college affects students: Findings and insights from twenty years of research|year=1991|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=P.M.|author2=Mayhew, M.J.|title=Moral Judgment Development in Higher Education: Insights from the Defining Issues Test|journal=Journal of Moral Education|year=2002|volume=31|issue=3|pages=247–270|doi=10.1080/0305724022000008106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McClosky|first=H.|author2=Brill, A.|title=Moral Judgment and antisocial behavior in early adolescence|journal=Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology|year=1983|volume=4|pages=189–199|doi=10.1016/0193-3973(83)90006-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4 component model of James Rest involves 4 psychological processes:
1.Moral sensitivity - the individual must be able to interpret a particular situation in terms of possible courses of action, determine who could be affected by the action, and understand how the affected party would regard the effect
2.Moral judgement - the individual must be able to judge which action is right and ought to decide what to do in a particular situation.
3.Moral motivation - the individual must be able to choose moral values over personal values
4.Moral character - the individual must have sufficient ego, strength and implementation skills to follow his or her intentions.

'''Julia Elizabeth Annas''' (born 1946)&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a British philosopher who has taught in the United States for the last quarter-century. She is [[Regents Professor]] of Philosophy at the [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.arizona.edu/julia-annas Julia Annas at the University of Arizona]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Annas graduated from [[Oxford University]] in 1968 with a B.A., and from [[Harvard University]] with an A.M. (1970) and a PhD (1972).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.u.arizona.edu/~jannas/&lt;/ref&gt; She was a [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] and Tutor at [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]] for fifteen years, before joining the faculty at Arizona in 1986, where she has taught since, apart for one year as a professor at Columbia University. She concentrates on the study of ancient [[Greek philosophy]], including Ethics, [[Psychology]] and [[Epistemology]]. 
Her current research interests are in Platonic ethics. She was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1992,&lt;ref name=AAAS /&gt; and a Fellow of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amphilsoc.org/members/electedApril2013 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403002431/https://www.amphilsoc.org/members/electedApril2013 |archivedate=3 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the founder and former editor of the annual journal, ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DmNNb_rcX1YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Julia+Annas+oxford&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XGP4zpmH-v&amp;sig=e31Dna25-74RJhU7pjtIJJyjBIM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ILl6S8SrJY-3ngerxbiwCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false| title=Oxford studies in ancient philosophy, Volume 20| editor=Julia Annas| publisher=Oxford University Press| year= 2001| isbn= 978-0-19-924225-2 | first=David | last=Sedley}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is married to the Hume scholar, David Owen, also a professor of philosophy at the University of Arizona.

==Philosophy==
Julia Annas has advocated ethics based on [[Virtue Ethics|character]], building on ideas attributed to [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher, [[Aristotle]] and making them relevant for contemporary moral discourse.&lt;ref&gt;A detailed account of her philosophical approach is set out in her 2011 book, Intelligent Virtue; an academic synopsis of the book is available [http://philpapers.org/rec/ANNIV here]&lt;/ref&gt; She has argued that being virtuous involves "practical reasoning"&lt;ref name="here"&gt;For more on this, see Julia Annas' article from 'Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences, 2008, accessible [http://philpapers.org/rec/ANNTPO here]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be compared to the "exercising of a practical skill".  Hence, she argues, rather than relating virtues to rules, principles, or an end goal, Annas says, first, people should ask how they can improve their moral "skills".&lt;ref name="here"/&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24073">'''The King Wen sequence''' ({{zh|c=文王卦序}}) is an arrangement of the sixty-four divination figures in [[I Ching|易經 Yì Jīng]], the I Ching or Book of Changes. They are called ''[[Hexagram (I Ching)|hexagrams]]'' in English because each figure is composed of six 爻 yáo—broken or unbroken lines, that represent [[Yin and yang|陰 yin or 陽 yang]] respectively.

The King Wen sequence is also known as the ''received'' or ''classical'' sequence because it is the oldest surviving arrangement of the hexagrams. Its true age and authorship are unknown. Traditionally, it is said that [[King Wen of Zhou|周文王 Zhōu Wén Wáng]] (King Wen) arranged the hexagrams in this sequence while imprisoned by [[King Zhou of Shang|商紂王 Shāng Zhòu Wáng]] in the 12th century&amp;nbsp;BC. A different arrangement, the ''binary sequence'' named in honor of the mythic [[culture hero]] [[Fu Xi|伏羲 Fú Xī]], originated in the [[Song Dynasty]]. It is believed to be the work of scholar [[Shao Yong|邵雍 Shào Yōng]] (1011–1077&amp;nbsp;AD). As mirrored by the [[Ba gua#Fuxi .22Earlier Heaven.22|先天 Earlier Heaven]] and [[Ba gua#King Wen .22Later Heaven.22|後天 Later Heaven]] arrangements of the eight trigrams, or [[Ba gua|八卦 bā guà]], it was customary to attribute authorship to these legendary figures. Of the two hexagram arrangements, the King Wen sequence is, however, of much greater antiquity than the Fu Xi sequence.&lt;ref name=biroco&gt;Marshall, Steve [http://www.biroco.com/yijing/sequence.htm Yijing hexagram sequences]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure of the sequence ==
The 64 hexagrams are grouped into 32 pairs. For 28 of the pairs, the second hexagram is created by turning the first upside down (i.e. 180° rotation). The exception to this rule is for the 8 symmetrical hexagrams that are the same after rotation (1 &amp; 2, 27 &amp; 28, 29 &amp; 30, 61 &amp; 62). Partners for these are given by inverting each line: solid becomes broken and broken becomes solid. These are indicated with icons in the table below.

Given the mathematical constraints of these simple rules, the number of lines that change within pair partners will always be even (either 2, 4, or 6). Whereas the number of lines that change ''between'' pairs depends on how the pairs are arranged, and the King Wen Sequence has notable characteristics in this regard. Of the 64 transitions, exactly 48 of them are even changes (32 within-pairs plus 16 between-pairs) and 16 are odd changes (all between-pairs). This is a precise 3 to 1 ratio of even to odd transitions. Of the odd transitions, 14 are changes of three lines and 2 are changes of one line. Changes of five are absent. Each transition within a pair appears to be the correlating opposite of the other transition within the pair.

=== Dual hexagrams ===
The I Ching book was traditionally split up in two parts with the first part covering the first 30 hexagrams of the King Wen sequence and the second part with the remaining 34.&lt;ref name="HackerMoore2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hacker |first1=Edward A. |last2=Moore |first2=Steve |date= 6 May 2003 |title=A brief note on the two–part division of the received order of the hexagrams in the ''Zhouyi'' |journal=Journal of Chinese Philosophy |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=219–221 |doi=10.1111/1540-6253.00115 |url=http://www.biroco.com/yijing/Hacker_Moore_Note_on_two_part_division.pdf |accessdate=31 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nielsen2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bent Nielsen|title=A companion to Yi jing numerology and cosmology: Chinese studies of images and numbers from Han (202 BCE-220 CE) to Song (960-1279 CE)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQ4im_ICmbYC&amp;pg=PA83|accessdate=31 May 2010|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7007-1608-1|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this was not mentioned in the classic commentaries but was explained in later [[Yuan dynasty]] commentaries: 8 hexagrams are the same when turned upside down and the other 56 present a different hexagram if inverted. This allows the hexagrams to be displayed succinctly in two equal columns or rows of 18 unique hexagrams each; half of the 56 invertible hexagrams plus the 8 non-invertible.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt;&lt;ref name=dual&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biroco.com/yijing/scan.htm |title=Yijing Dao - Archive of Yijing-related scans from Chinese and other sources |date=20 February 2010 |accessdate=19 May 2010 |quote=If you look at the scan of [http://www.biroco.com/yijing/scans/ztddivision601.jpg ztd601] you will see two rows of 18 hexagrams, and notice that the hexagrams that are different when inverted have the hexagram name written upside down above them (the table reads from right to left, with hexagram 1, Qian, upper right). This is the secret of it, a single hexagram is made to represent two hexagrams when its inverse differs. There are eight hexagrams the same both ways up, occurring in the following pairs: 1/2, 27/28, 29/30, and 61/62. If you look now at the diagram you can see that six of these hexagrams occur in the top row of 18 hexagrams while only two appear in the bottom row of 18. This means that the top row represents 30 individual hexagrams while the bottom row accounts for 34 hexagrams. This very clever and yet simple arrangement appears to be the reasoning behind the unequal division, which is actually an equal division when 'dual hexagrams' are used in this way. The same principle is also shown in [http://www.biroco.com/yijing/scans/ztddivision762.jpg ztd762]. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==
Over the centuries there were many attempts to explain this sequence. Some basic elements are obvious: each symbol is paired with an "upside-down" neighbor, except for 1, 27, 29, and 61 which are "vertically" symmetrical and paired with "inversed" neighbors.

A [[Combinatorics|combinatorial mathematical]] basis was explained for the first time in 2006.&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biroco.com/yijing/images/kwscook.jpg |author=Cook, Richard S. |title=《周易》卦序詮解 (Zhou yi guaxu quanjie)|format=JPEG Image, 1024x793 |year=2006 |accessdate=22 May 2010 }} STEDT Monograph 5: ''[http://stedt.berkeley.edu/html/publications.html#mng5 Classical Chinese Combinatorics]: Derivation of the Book of Changes Hexagram Sequence.'' 660 pages. {{ISBN|0-944613-44-6}}.

'''Kunkhyen Pema Karpo''' ({{bo|t=ཀུན་མཁྱེན་པདྨ་དཀར་པོ་|w=kun-mkhyen pad-ma dkar-po}}) (1527&amp;ndash;1592 CE) was the fourth [[Gyalwang Drukpa]], head of the [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa]] lineage of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. He was the most famous and learned of all the Gyalwang Drukpas. During his lifetime, he was known as the grand lama amongst all grand lamas, and was a teacher to many lamas and disciples all over Tibet. 

Pema Karpo authored twenty-four volumes writing on philosophy, logic, literature, history, and astrology which have since formed a widely studied corpus of work. He is also quite famous for his writings on [[Mahamudra]]. He founded [[Druk Sangag Choeling]] monastery at [[Jar (Tibet)|Jar]] in southern [[Tibet]], establishing it as the new seat of the Drukpa lineage.

This omniscient master was the first Gyalwang Drukpa to concoct the famous enlightenment pill known as Ja-Tsukma, utilizing esoteric ingredients offered by the dakinis. Before he died, Pema Karpo promised that he would have two incarnations to propagate the spiritual teachings. In accordance with this prophecy, two incarnations were discovered.

*The Oral transmission of the Six Cycles of Same Taste: Rolled into a ball [Path walking] instructions

==Trivia==
The multi-award winning [[Druk White Lotus School]] in [[Shey]], [[Ladakh]], is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwls.org/ link to the school's website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French translation (by the [[Duke of Luynes]] with Descartes' supervision) was published in 1647 as ''Méditations Métaphysiques''. The title may contain a misreading by the printer, mistaking ''animae immortalitas'' for ''animae immaterialitas'', as suspected by A. Baillet.&lt;ref&gt;Adrien Baillet: ''La Vie de Mr. Descartes'' Paris 1692 p. 176. Cf. Theodor Ebert, ''Immortalitas oder Immaterialitas? Zum Untertitel von Descartes' Meditationen'' in: ''Archiv für Geschichte der Philosophie 74 (1992) 180-202,&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is made up of six meditations, in which Descartes first discards all belief in things that are not absolutely [[certainty|certain]], and then tries to establish what can be known for sure. He wrote the meditations as if he had meditated for six days: each meditation refers to the last one as "yesterday". (In fact, Descartes began work on the ''Meditations'' in 1639.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/#H1|title=Descartes, René: Overview [The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]|publisher=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=2010-06-17 |date= 2008-09-13|last= Skirry |first= J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most influential philosophical texts ever written, it is widely read to this day.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Richard A. |last1=Watson |authorlink1=Richard Watson (philosopher) |title=René Descartes |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online.

The book consists of the presentation of Descartes' [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] system in its most detailed level and in the expanding of his philosophical system, first introduced in the fourth part of his ''[[Discourse on Method]]'' (1637). Descartes' metaphysical thought is also found in the ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644), which the author intended to be a philosophy guidebook.

==Letter of Dedication and Preface==
'''Letter of dedication'''

''To the most wise and illustrious the Dean and Doctors of the [[University of Paris|Sacred Faculty of Theology in Paris]]''

Descartes says that he is asking the protection of the Faculty for his work, and to this end he writes the present dedication.

His first consideration is that the existence of God has to be demonstrated philosophically, besides the theological reasons for belief, particularly if we consider to make a demonstration for the non-believers. Moreover, the believers could be accused of making a [[circular reasoning]], when saying that we must believe in God because of the Scriptures, and in the authority of the Scriptures because they have been inspired by God. He further indicates how the very Scriptures say that the mind of man is sufficient to discover God.

His aim is to apply a method to demonstrate these two truths, in a so clear and evident manner that result to be evident. This method he has developed for the Sciences.&lt;ref name=preface&gt;René Descartes. Meditations on First Philosophy. Edited Stanley Tweyman. Routledge. 34–40. London and New York. 1993. {{ISBN|-1314221401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Preface to the reader'''

Descartes explains how he made a mention of the two questions, the existence of God, and the soul, in his ''[[Discourse on Method]]''. Following this, he received objections, and two of them he considers are of importance. The first is how he concludes that the essence of the soul is a thing that thinks, excluding all other nature. To this he says that he has a clear perception that he is a thinking thing, and has no other clear perception, and from this he concludes that there is nothing else in the essence of the self.

The second is that from the idea I have of something that is more perfect than myself, it cannot be concluded that it exists.  In the treatise we will see that in fact from the idea that there is something more perfect than myself, it follows that this exists.

It goes on to comment that on a general level the reasoning used by the atheists for denying the existence of God is based in the fact that "we ascribe to God affections that are human, or we attribute so much strength and wisdom to our minds" that we presume to understand that which God can and ought to do. He says that we have to consider God as incomprehensible and infinite, and our minds as limited and finite.

Finally says that the treatise was submitted to some men of learning to know their difficulties and objections, and are answered at the end of it.&lt;ref name=preface/&gt;

==Summary of ''Meditations''==

===Meditation I: Concerning Those Things That Can Be Called into Doubt===

====Summary====
The First Meditation, subtitled "What can be called into doubt", opens with the Meditator reflecting on the number of falsehoods he has believed during his life and on the subsequent faultiness of the body of knowledge he has built up from these falsehoods. He has resolved to sweep away all he thinks he knows and to start again from the foundations, building up his knowledge once more on more certain grounds. He has seated himself alone, by the fire, free of all worries so that he can demolish his former opinions with care.

The Meditator reasons that he need only find some reason to doubt his present opinions in order to prompt him to seek sturdier foundations for knowledge. Rather than doubt every one of his opinions individually, he reasons that he might cast them all into doubt if he can doubt the foundations and basic principles on which the opinions are founded.

Everything that the Meditator has accepted as most true he has come to learn from or through his senses. He acknowledges that sometimes the senses can deceive, but only with respect to objects that are very small or far away, and that our sensory knowledge on the whole is quite sturdy. The Meditator acknowledges that insane people might be more deceived, but that he is clearly not one of them and needn't worry himself about that.

However, the Meditator realizes that he is often convinced when he is dreaming that he is sensing real objects. He feels certain that he is awake and sitting by the fire, but reflects that often he has dreamed this very sort of thing and been wholly convinced by it. Though his present sensations may be dream images, he suggests that even dream images are drawn from waking experience, much like paintings in that respect. Even when a painter creates an imaginary creature, like a mermaid, the composite parts are drawn from real things—women and fish, in the case of a mermaid. And even when a painter creates something entirely new, at least the colors in the painting are drawn from real experience. Thus, the Meditator concludes, though he can doubt composite things, he cannot doubt the simple and universal parts from which they are constructed like shape, quantity, size, time, etc. While we can doubt studies based on composite things, like medicine, astronomy, or physics, he concludes that we cannot doubt studies based on simple things, like arithmetic and geometry.

On further reflection, the Meditator realizes that even simple things can be doubted. [[Omnipotence|Omnipotent]] God could make even our conception of mathematics false. One might argue that God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, since our imperfect senses would not have been created by a perfect being.

The Meditator finds it almost impossible to keep his habitual opinions and assumptions out of his head, try as he might. He resolves to pretend that these opinions are totally false and imaginary in order to counterbalance his habitual way of thinking. The Meditator wishes to avoid an excess of skepticism and instead uses a skeptical method, an important distinction. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;He supposes that not God, but some [[evil demon]] has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he knows is false. By doubting everything, he can at least be sure not to be misled into falsehood by this demon.

Before retiring for the night, the Meditator indulges in his old beliefs, afraid to awake to a life of confusion. As a result he allows for the tempting falsehoods to continue unabridged. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Philosophy: Classical and Contemporary Readings|last=Perry, Bratman, Fischer|first=John, Michael, John Martin|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-981299-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Analysis====

Descartes saw his Meditations as providing the metaphysical underpinning of his new physics. Like Galileo, he sought to overturn what he saw as two-thousand-year-old prejudices injected into the Western tradition by Aristotle. The Aristotelian thought of Descartes' day placed a great weight on the testimony of the senses, suggesting that all knowledge comes from the senses. The Meditator's suggestion that all one's most certain knowledge comes from the senses is meant to appeal directly to the Aristotelian philosophers who will be reading the Meditations. The motivation, then, behind the First Meditation is to start in a position the Aristotelian philosophers would agree with and then, subtly, to seduce them away from it. Descartes is aware of how revolutionary his ideas are, and must pay lip service to the orthodox opinions of the day in order to be heeded.

Reading the First Meditation as an effort to coax Aristotelians away from their customary opinions allows us to read different interpretations into the different stages of doubt. For instance, there is some debate as to whether Descartes intended his famous "Dream Argument" to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming—that though there is waking experience, I can never know which moments are dreams and which are waking—or the possibility of a universal dream—that my whole life is a dream and that there is no waking world. If we read Descartes as suggesting the universal possibility of dreaming, we can explain an important distinction between the Dream Argument and the later "Evil Demon Argument". The latter suggests that all we know is false and that we cannot trust the senses one bit. The Dream Argument, if meant to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming, suggests only that the senses are not always and wholly reliable. The Dream Argument questions Aristotelian epistemology, while the Evil Demon Argument does away with it altogether. The ''Painter's Analogy'', which draws on the Dream Argument, concludes that mathematics and other purely cerebral studies are far more certain than astronomy or physics, which is an important step away from the Aristotelian reliance on the senses and toward Cartesian rationalism.

Read on its own, the First Meditation can be seen as presenting skeptical doubts as a subject of study in their own right. Certainly, skepticism is a much discussed and hotly debated topic in philosophy, even today. Descartes raised the mystifying question of how we can claim to know with certainty anything about the world around us. The idea is not that these doubts are probable, but that their possibility can never be entirely ruled out. And if we can never be certain, how can we claim to know anything? Skepticism cuts straight to the heart of the Western philosophical enterprise and its attempt to provide a certain foundation for our knowledge and understanding of the world. It can even be pushed so far as to be read as a challenge to our very notion of rationality.

It is difficult to justify a dismissal of skepticism. Western philosophy since Descartes has been largely marked and motivated by an effort to overcome this problem. 
Descartes' doubt is a methodological and rational doubt. That is, the Meditator is not just doubting everything at random, but is providing solid reasons for his doubt at each stage. For instance, he rejects the possibility that he might be mad, since that would undercut the rationality that motivates his doubt. Descartes is trying to set up this doubt within a rational framework, and needs to maintain a claim to rationality for his arguments to proceed.
He goes on to suggest more powerful reasons to doubt that his beliefs are true.  In general, his method is that of forming skeptical hypotheses — [[methodic doubt]].  In the first meditation, he considers whether he is mad, dreaming, or deceived by an [[evil demon]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The general form of these arguments is:
# If I am dreaming/deceived, then my beliefs are unreliable.

Descartes' goal — as stated at the beginning of the meditation — is to suspend judgment about any belief that is even slightly doubtful.  The skeptical scenarios show that all of the beliefs he considers in the first meditation—including, at the very least, all his beliefs about the physical world, are doubtful.  So he decides to suspend judgment. He will henceforth give up all of his beliefs about the physical world.  He also decides to continually remind himself to avoid habitually falling into accepting beliefs without support, a habit to which he is susceptible.

===Meditation II: Concerning the Nature of the Human Mind: That the mind is more known than the body===
In ''Meditation II'', Descartes lays out a pattern of thought, sometimes called [[representationalism]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-epistemology/#5.2
|title= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Descartes' Epistemology
|publisher=plato.stanford.edu
|accessdate=2013-04-03 |date= 2010-07-20 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; in response to the doubts forwarded in ''Meditation I''.  He identifies five steps in this theory:
# We have access to only the world of our [[Idea#René Descartes|ideas]]; things in the world are accessed only indirectly.
# These ideas are understood to include all of the contents of the mind, including perceptions, [[Mental image#Philosophical ideas about mental images|images]], memories, [[concept]]s, beliefs, [[intention]]s, decisions, etc.
# Ideas and the things they represent are separate from each other.
# These represented things are many times "external" to the [[mind]].
# It is possible for these ideas to constitute either accurate or false representations.

Descartes argues that this representational theory [[Philosophy of mind#Dualist solutions to the mind–body problem|disconnects the world from the mind]], leading to the need for some sort of bridge to span the separation and provide ''good reasons'' to believe that the ideas accurately represent the outside world. The first plank he uses in constructing this bridge can be found in the following excerpt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have convinced myself that there is nothing in the world — no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Doesn't it follow that I don't exist? No, surely I must exist if it's me who is convinced of something.  But there is a deceiver, supremely powerful and cunning whose aim is to see that I am always deceived. But surely I exist, if I am deceived. Let him deceive me all he can, he will never make it the case that I am nothing while I think that I am something. Thus having fully weighed every consideration, I must finally conclude that the statement "I am, I exist" must be true whenever I state it or mentally consider it.  (Descartes, Meditation II:  On the Nature of the Human Mind, Which Is Better Known Than the Body).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, one's consciousness implies one's existence. In one of Descartes' replies to objections to the book, he summed this up in the phrase, "''I think therefore I am''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egs.edu/library/rene-descartes/quotes/ |title=René Descartes – French Philosopher and Scientist – Quotes |publisher=Egs.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224052623/http://www.egs.edu/library/rene-descartes/quotes/ |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once he secures his existence, however, Descartes seeks to find out what "I" is.  He rejects the typical method, which looks for a definition (e.g., [[Rational Animal]]), because the words used in the definition would then need to be defined.  He seeks ''simple terms'' that do not need to be defined in this way, but whose meaning can just be "seen".  From these ''self-evident'' truths, ''complex terms'' can be built up.

The first of these self-evident truths is Descartes' proof of existence turned on its head:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But what then am I? A thinking thing. And what is that? Something that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, and also senses and has mental images.  (Descartes, Meditation II: On the Nature of the Human Mind, Which Is Better Known Than the Body).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To define himself further, Descartes turns to the example of [[Beeswax|wax]].  He determines that wax isn't wax because of its color, texture or shape, as all of these things can change and the substance still be wax.  He believes that wax is perceived "by the intellect alone" (Meditation II: On the Nature of the Human Mind, Which Is Better Known Than the Body).  Therefore, he distinguishes between ''ordinary perception'' and ''judgment''.  When one understands the mathematical principles of the substance, such as its expansion under heat, figure and motion, the knowledge of the wax can be ''clear and distinct''.

If a substance such as wax can be known in this fashion, then the same must be of ourselves.  The self, then, is not determined by what we sense of ourselves — these hands, this head, these eyes — but by simply the things one thinks.  Thus, one "can't grasp anything more easily or plainly than [his] mind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wright.edu/cola/descartes/meditation2.html Descartes original meditation 2 translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes concludes that he exists because he is a "thinking thing".  If he is the thing that can be deceived and can think and have thoughts, then he must exist.

===Meditation III: Concerning God, That He Exists===
Descartes proposed that there are three types of ideas: [[innatism|Innate]], Fictitious, and Adventitious.  Innate ideas are and have always been within us, fictitious or invented ideas come from our imagination, and Adventitious ideas come from experiences of the world.  He argues that the idea of God is Innate and placed in us by God, and he rejected the possibility that the idea of God is Invented or Adventitious.

'''Argument 1'''

# Something cannot come from nothing.
# The cause of an idea must have at least as much formal reality as the idea has objective reality.
# I have in me an idea of God.  This idea has infinite objective reality.
# I cannot be the cause of this idea, since I am not an infinite and perfect being.  I don't have enough formal reality.  Only an infinite and perfect being could cause such an idea.
# So God — a being with infinite formal reality — must exist (and be the source of my idea of God).
# An absolutely perfect being is a good, benevolent being.
# So God is benevolent...
# So God would not deceive me, and would not permit me to err without giving me a way to correct my errors.

'''Argument 2'''
# I exist.
# My existence must have a cause.
# The only possible [[ultimate cause]]s are
::a) myself
::b) my always having existed
::c) my parents
::d) something less perfect than God
::e) God
:4. Not a. If I had created myself, I would have made myself perfect.
:5. Not b. This does not solve the problem. If I am a dependent being, I need to be continually sustained by another.
:6. Not c. This leads to an [[infinite regress]].
:7. Not d. The idea of perfection that exists in me cannot have originated from a non-perfect being.
:8. Therefore, e. God exists.

Descartes argued that he had a clear and distinct idea of God. In the same way that the cogito was self-evident, so too is the existence of God, as his perfect idea of a perfect being could not have been caused by anything less than a perfect being.&lt;ref name="wright.edu"&gt;http://www.wright.edu/cola/descartes/meditation3.html Descartes original meditation 3 translation&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meditation IV: Concerning the True and the False===

The conclusions of the previous Meditations that "I" and "God" both exist lead to another problem: If God is perfectly good and the source of all that is, how is there room for error or falsehood?  Descartes attempts to answer this question in ''Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If I've got everything in me from God and He hasn't given me the ability to make errors, it doesn't seem possible for me ever to be in error.  (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The framework of his arguments center on the [[Great Chain of Being]], in which God's perfect goodness is relative to His perfect being.  On the extreme opposite end of the scale is complete nothingness, which is also the most evil state possible.  Thus, humans are an intermediary between these two extremes, being less "real" or "good" than God, but more "real" and "good" than nothingness.  Thus, error (as a part of evil) is not a positive reality, it is only the absence of what is correct.  In this way, its existence is allowed within the context of a perfectly inerrant God.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I find that I am "intermediate" between God and nothingness, between the supreme entity and nonentity. Insofar as I am the creation of the supreme entity, there's nothing in me to account for my being deceived or led into error, but, inasmuch as I somehow participate in nothing or nonentity — that is, insofar as I am distinct from the supreme entity itself and lack many things — it's not surprising that I go wrong. I thus understand that, in itself, error is a lack, rather than a real thing dependent on God. Hence, I understand that I can err without God's having given me a special ability to do so. Rather, I fall into error because my God-given ability to judge the truth is not infinite.  (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Descartes also concedes two points that might allow for the possibility of his ability to make errors.  First, he notes that it is very possible that his limited knowledge prevents him from understanding ''why'' God chose to create him so he could make mistakes.  If he could see the things that God could see, with a complete and infinite scope, perhaps he would judge his ability to err as the best option.  He uses this point to attack the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] structure of [[Four causes|causes]]. The final cause described by Aristotle are the "what for" of an object, but Descartes claims that because he is unable to comprehend completely the mind of God, it is impossible to understand completely the "[[Teleological argument#Aquinas|why]]" through science — only the "how".

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I realize that I shouldn't be surprised at God's doing things that I can't explain.  I shouldn't doubt His existence just because I find that I sometimes can't understand why or how He has made something.  I know that my nature is weak and limited and that God's is limitless, incomprehensible, and infinite, and, from this, I can infer that He can do innumerable things whose reasons are unknown to me.  On this ground alone, I regard the common practice of explaining things in terms of their purposes to be useless in physics: it would be foolhardy of me to think that I can discover God's purposes.  (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Secondly, he considers the possibility that an apparent error at the individual level could be understood within [[holism|the totality]] of creation as error free.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When asking whether God's works are perfect, I ought to look at all of them together, not at one isolation.  For something that seems imperfect when viewed alone might seem completely perfect when regarded as having a place in the world.  Of course, since calling everything into doubt, I haven't established that anything exists besides me and God. But, when I consider God's immense power, I can't deny that He has made — or, in any case, that He could have made — many other things, and I must therefore view myself as having a place in a universe.  (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lastly, ''Meditation IV'' attributes the source of error to a discrepancy between two divine gifts: understanding and [[free will]].  Understanding is given in an incomplete form, while will (by nature) can only be either completely given or not given at all.  When he is presented with a certain amount of understanding and then ''chooses'' to [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|act outside of that]], he is in error.  Thus, the gifts of God (understanding and will) both remain good and only the incorrect usage by him remains as error.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If I suspend judgement when I don't clearly and distinctly grasp what is true, I obviously do right and am not deceived.  But, if I either affirm or deny in a case of this sort, I misuse my freedom of choice.  If I affirm what is false, I clearly err, and, if I stumble onto the truth, I'm still blameworthy since the light of nature reveals that a perception of the understanding should always precede a decision of the will.  In these misuses of freedom of choice lies the deprivation that accounts for error.  And this deprivation, I maintain, lies in the working of the will insofar as it comes from me — not in my God-given ability to will, or even in the will's operation insofar as it derives from Him.  (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).&lt;ref name="wright.edu"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Meditation V: Concerning the Essence of Material Things, and Again Concerning God, That He Exists===
''Meditation V: Concerning the Essence of Material Things, and Again Concerning God, That He Exists'' begins with the stated purpose of expanding the "known items" of God and self to include outside material objects; but Descartes saves that for ''Meditation VI'' in lieu of something he deems more fundamental but in the same direction: a discussion concerning the ''ideas'' of those external items.  Along the way, he advances another [[logic]]al proof of [[Ontological argument#Descartes' ontological arguments|God's existence]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Before asking whether any such objects exist outside me, I ought to consider the ideas of these objects as they exist in my thoughts and see which are clear and which confused. (Descartes, Meditation V: On the Essence of Material Objects and More on God's Existence).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Descartes separates external [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] into those that are clear and distinct and those that are confused and obscure.  The former group consists of the ideas of [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]], [[Time|duration]] and [[motion (physics)|movement]]. These geometrical ideas cannot be misconstrued or combined in a way that makes them false.  For example, if the idea of a creature with the head of a [[giraffe]], the body of a [[lion]] and [[tail]] of a [[beaver]] was constructed and the question asked if the creature had a large intestine, the answer would have to be invented. But, no mathematical re-arrangement of a [[triangle]] could allow its three internal angles to sum to anything but 180 degrees. Thus, Descartes perceived that truths may have a nature or essence of themselves, independent of the thinker. (In Descartes' formulation, this is a ''mathematical'' truth only pragmatically related to nature; the [[Euclidean geometry#Sum of the angles of a triangle|properties of triangles in Euclidean geometry]] remain mathematically certain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Descartes in His Time  |title= Discourse on the method: and, Meditations on first philosophy |date=August 1996 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bKzKvsbLlAEC&amp;pg=139 |quote= If Euclid is right, it is ''not'' the case that we know ''nothing'' permanently and for certain. A natural philosophy grounded in mathematics avoids the traditional objections to empirical or sensory knowledge: the sixteenth-century skeptics had been premature in despairing of any enduring systems of theoretical knowledge. |publisher= Yale University Press |editor1-first= D. |editor1-last= Weissman, William Theodore Bluhm |first= S. |last= Toulmin |page= 139 |series= Rethinking the Western Tradition }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I find in myself innumerable ideas of things which, though they may not exist outside me, can't be said to be nothing. While I have some control over my thoughts of these things, I do not make the things up: they have their own real and immutable natures. Suppose, for example, that I have a mental image of a triangle. While it may be that no figure of this sort does exist or ever has existed outside my thought, the figure has a fixed nature (essence or form), immutable and eternal, which hasn't been produced by me and isn't dependent of my mind.  (Descartes, Meditation V: On the Essence of Material Objects and More on God's Existence).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While thinking about the independence of these ideas of external objects, Descartes realizes that he is just as certain about God as he is about these mathematical ideas. He asserts that this is natural as the ideas of God are the only ideas that imply God's existence.  He uses the example of a mountain and a valley.  While one cannot picture a [[mountain]] without a [[valley]], it's possible that these do not exist.  However, the fact that one cannot conceive of God without existence inherently rules out the possibility of God's non-existence.  Simply put, the argument is framed as follows:
#God is defined as an infinitely perfect being.
#Perfection includes existence.
#So God exists.

This [[ontological]] argument originated in the work of [[St. Anselm]], the medieval [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosopher and theologian. While Descartes had already claimed to have confirmed God's existence through previous arguments, this one allows him to put to rest any discontent he might have had with his "distinct and clear" criteria for truth. With a confirmed existence of God, all doubt that what one previously thought was real and not a [[dream]] can be removed.  Having made this realization, Descartes asserts that without this sure knowledge in the existence of a supreme and perfect being, assurance of any truth is impossible.

{{quote |text= Thus I plainly see that the certainty and truth of all my knowledge derives from one thing: my thought of the true God. Before I knew Him, I couldn't know anything else perfectly. But now I can plainly and certainly know innumerable things, not only about God and other mental beings, but also about the nature of physical objects, insofar as it is the subject-matter of pure mathematics.  |sign= Descartes |source= Meditation V: On the Essence of Material Objects and More on God's Existence)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wright.edu/cola/descartes/meditation5.html|title=Descartes' Meditations}} as translated by [[John Veitch (poet)|John Veitch]] in 1901&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Meditation VI: Concerning the Existence of Material Things, and the Real Distinction between Mind and Body===

In ''Meditation VI: Concerning the Existence of Material Things, and the Real Distinction between Mind and Body'', Descartes addresses the potential existence of material outside of the self and God.  First, he asserts that such objects ''can'' exist simply because God is able to make them. Therefore, our assumption of the physical world outside of ourselves in non theoretical sense.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Insofar as they are the subject of pure mathematics, I now know at least that they can exist, because I grasp them clearly and distinctly. For God can undoubtedly make whatever I can grasp in this way, and I never judge that something is impossible for Him to make unless there would be a contradiction in my grasping the thing distinctly.  (Descartes, Meditation VI: On the Existence of Material Objects from Body).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Knowing that the existence of such objects is possible, Descartes then turns to the prevalence of mental images as proof.  To do this, he draws a distinction between [[imagination]] and understanding—imagination being a non-linguistic "faculty of knowledge to the body which is immediately present to it [...] without intellection or conception," which therefore exists like a mental [[photograph]]; and understanding (or apprehending) being something that is not necessarily pictured. He uses an example of this to clarify:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When I have a mental image of a triangle, for example, I don't just understand that it is a figure bounded by three lines; I also "look at" the lines as though they were present to my mind's eye.  And this is what I call having a mental image. When I want to think of a [[chiliagon]], I understand that it is a figure with a thousand sides as well as I understand that a triangle is a figure with three, but I can't imagine its sides or "look" at them as though they were present (...) Thus I observe that a special effort of mind is necessary to the act of imagination, which is not required to conceiving or understanding (ad intelligendum); and this special exertion of mind clearly shows the difference between imagination and pure intellection (imaginatio et intellectio pura). (Descartes, Meditation VI: On the Existence of Material Objects and the Real Distinction of Mind from Body).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wright.edu/cola/descartes/meditation6.html#e2|title=Descartes' Meditations}} as translated by [[John Veitch (poet)|John Veitch]] in 1901&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Descartes has still not given proof that such external objects exist. At this point, he has only shown that their existence could conveniently explain this mental process. To obtain this proof, he first reviews his premises for the ''Meditations'' — that the senses cannot be trusted and what he is taught "by nature" does not have much credence.  However, he views these arguments within a new context; after writing ''Meditation I'', he has proved the existence of himself and of a perfect God.  Thus, Descartes jumps quickly to proofs of the division between the body and mind and that material things exist:

'''Proof for the body being [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|distinct from the mind]]'''
# It is possible for God to create anything I can clearly and distinctly perceive.
# If God creates something to be independent of another, they are distinct from each other.
# I clearly and distinctly understand my existence as a thinking thing (which does not require the existence of a body).
# So God can create a thinking thing independently of a body.
# I clearly and distinctly understand my body as an extended thing (which does not require a mind).
# So God can create a body independently of a mind.
# So my mind is a reality distinct from my body.
# So I (a thinking thing) can exist without a body.

'''Proof of the reality of external material things'''
# I have a "strong inclination" to believe in the reality of external material things due to my senses.
# God must have created me with this nature.
# If independent material things do not exist, God is a deceiver.
# But God is not a deceiver.
# So material things exist and contain the properties essential to them.

After using these two arguments to dispel [[solipsism]] and [[skepticism]], Descartes seems to have succeeded in defining reality as being in three parts: God (infinite), minds, and material things (both finite). He closes by addressing natural phenomena that might appear to challenge his philosophy, such as [[phantom limb]]s, dreams, and [[dropsy]].

==Objections and replies==

Descartes submitted his manuscript to many philosophers, [[Theology|theologians]] and a [[logic]]ian before publishing the ''Meditations''. Their objections and his replies (many of which are quite extensive) were included in the first publication of the ''Meditations''. In the Preface to the Meditations, Descartes asks the reader "not to pass judgment on the Meditations until they have been kind enough to read through all these objections and my replies to them.”  Thus, this dialogue could be seen as an integral part of Descartes' views expressed in the ''Meditations''.

The seven objectors were, in order (of the sets as they were published):
* The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] theologian [[Johannes Caterus]] (Johan de Kater) – first set of objections.
* Various "theologians and philosophers" gathered by Descartes' friend and principal correspondent, [[Friar]] [[Marin Mersenne]] – second set of objections
* The [[English people|English]] philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] – third set of objections
* The [[theologian]] and logician [[Antoine Arnauld]] – fourth set
* The philosopher [[Pierre Gassendi]] – fifth set (Descartes wrote that all of these could be easily dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter= Appendix to Fifth Objections and Replies: Author's note concerning the fifth set of objections |quote= I have not been able to discover a single objection which those who have some slight understanding of my Meditations will not, in my view, be able to answer quite easily without any help from me. |title= Meditations, Objections and Replies |year= 1647 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Another miscellany gathered by Mersenne – sixth set
* The [[Jesuit]] Pierre Bourdin – seventh set of objections

They make many objections to Descartes’ arguments and method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/GMR/hmp/texts/modern/hobbes/objections/objindex.html |title= Objections to Descartes Meditations |accessdate= 2010-06-15 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100906100932/http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/GMR/hmp/texts/modern/hobbes/objections/objindex.html |archivedate= 2010-09-06 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the objections show that the objector has misunderstood the text, or wilfully misquoted it, as in the last set of objections by the Jesuit.  Descartes’ response to these is often dismissive and curt.  Other objections are more powerful, and in some cases it is controversial whether Descartes [[rebuttal|responds]] to them successfully (refer to Hobbes' objections). At times Descartes' demeanor suggests that he expected no criticisms would be forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/GMR/hmp/texts/modern/hobbes/objections/objects.html Hobbes objections to Descartes' Meditations with Descartes' replies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210101629/http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/GMR/hmp/texts/modern/hobbes/objections/objects.html |date=2009-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most powerful objections include the following:

'''Objections to proof(s) of God’s existence:'''

A.  We have no (clear) idea of an infinite Being (1st, 2nd, and 5th objections).

B.  From the fact that I can think of a perfect being, it doesn’t follow that the perfect being exists (1st, 2nd, and 5th).

C.  We could get the idea of God without God’s causing the idea (2nd, 3rd).

D.  Nothing can [[Causal relation|cause itself to exist]] (4th), so God can’t [[Primum movens#Biblical Parallel|cause himself to exist]] unless God is composed of some essence that in and of itself has the property of timelessness.

'''Objections to the [[epistemology]]:'''

A.  How can we be sure that what we think is a clear and distinct perception really is clear and distinct (3rd, 5th)?

B.  [[Cartesian circle|Circle objection]] 1: if we aren’t certain that judgments based on clear and distinct ideas are true before we prove God’s existence, then we can’t be certain that we are a thinking thing (2nd). Circle objection 2: if we aren’t certain that clear and distinct ideas are true before we prove God’s existence, then we can’t be certain that God exists, since we use clear and distinct ideas to prove God’s existence (4th).

C.  Contrary to what Descartes argues, we ''are'' certain that bodies exist/that perception coincides with reality (5th, 6th), but we are not certain that the bodies of our perception are actual bodies in an existent external world.

'''Objections to [[philosophy of mind]]:'''

A. Ideas are always [[mental image|imagistic]] (3rd), so we have no idea of thinking substance (non-image idea).

B. We can’t conclude that the mind (thinking thing) is not also a [[matter|corporeal]] thing, unless we know that we know everything about the mind.  But we don’t know that we know everything about the mind.  So we don’t know that the mind isn’t corporeal.  (2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th).

[[Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine|Elisabeth of Bohemia]] also [[Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine#Character|corresponded with]] Descartes on the ''Meditations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Correspondence between Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia and Rene Descartes |series= The Other Voice in Early Modern Europe |publisher= University Of Chicago Press  |date=June 2007 |isbn= 978-0-226-20442-0 |editor1-first= L. |editor1-last= Shapiro }}&lt;/ref&gt; She objected both to his description of the union between mind and body, and that [[Meta-ethics#Substantial theories|virtue and moral truths]] seem to need to be grasped by something other than the intellect (despite Descartes's assertion that all truths must be grasped intellectually).&lt;ref&gt;

==Influence and legacy==
The historical impact of the six meditations has been divided. The first two meditations, which employed the skeptical [[methodic doubt]] and concluded that only the ego and its thoughts are indubitable, have had a huge impact in the history of philosophy.&lt;ref name="Smith2003p12"/&gt; They are often considered as epoch-making for modernity, and an unavoidable first step for any modern philosophical thinking.&lt;ref name="Smith2003p12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Husserl]] (1929) ''[[Cartesian Meditations]]'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=jxvDiFFaH9kC&amp;pg=PA4 p.4] quotation: {{quotation|[...] great weight must be given to the consideration that, in philosophy, the ''Meditations'' were epoch-making in a quite unique sense, and precisely because of their going back to the pure ''ego cogito''. Descartes, in fact, inaugurates an entirely new kind of philosophy. Changing its total style, philosophy takes a radical turn: from naive objectivism to transcendental subjectivism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur David Smith, author of the ''Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Husserl'', claims that since [[Edmund Husserl]] usually refers only to "the first two" of the Meditations, therefore Husserl must have thought that they are the only part of Descartes' work with any philosophical importance at all.&lt;ref name="Smith2003p12"&gt;Smith, Arthur David (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2kw7kRPlGRMC&amp;pg=PA12 ''Routledge philosophy guidebook to Husserl and the Cartesian meditations''] pp.12–3 quotation: {{quotation|What even more precisely, therefore, is distinctive of Descartes is his 'regression' to the indubitable ego ''as the only possible way of combating scepticism''. [...] Since, for Husserl, scepticism provided the goal that led the Greeks to the primal establishment of phylosophy, such a regression to the ego now emerges for the first time with Descartes as the necessary first step in philosophy. ''This'' is the 'ethernal significance' of Descartes's ''Meditations''. They 'indicate, or attempt to indicate, the necessary style of the philosophycal beginning'. [...]

In fact, the ''Cogito'' is the ''only'' thing in Descartes that is, according to Husserl, of any philosophical significance at all. Almost every time he refers to Descartes's ''Meditations'' in his other writings (e.g., ''EP I'', 63; ''Crisis'' 76 [75]), it is the ''first two'' meditations that he refers to: those that solely concern the regression to the indubitability of the ego and its 'thoughts' through the offices of methodical doubt. Descartes's last four meditations do not even get a look in.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oliva Sabuco de Nantes Barrera''' (1562–1622) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] writer in [[Holistic health|holistic medical philosophy]] in the late 16th – early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Allen 1991, p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt; She was interested in the interaction between the physical and psychological phenomena; therefore she wrote a collection of medical and psychological treatises that target human nature and explain the effects of emotions on the body and soul.&lt;ref name = Waithe265&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; She analyzed theoretical claims of ancient philosophers and wrote an early theory of what is now considered [[Applied Psychology|applied psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

She was born in [[Alcaraz]], Spain in 1562 and was baptized in the Holy Trinity church on December 2 of that same year.&lt;ref name = Cannon&gt;Cannon 1916, p. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was Francisca de Cozar and her father was Don Miguel Sabuco y Alvarez.&lt;ref name = Cannon /&gt; By 1580, at the age of 18, she was married to Don Acacio de Buedo.&lt;ref name = Cannon /&gt; Although not much is known about her formal education it is evident that Oliva Sabuco was taught medicine by her father.&lt;ref&gt;Kersey 1989, p. 1143.&lt;/ref&gt; She was well acquainted with classical and contemporary philosophy and was knowledgeable about medical theory.&lt;ref name=Waithe268&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; By age 25 she already published a novel far ahead of her time.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Mind–body coexistence===
Sabuco combined ancient Greek and Christian philosophies, along with [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] views in order to explain how the mind and body interact in a [[holistic]] manner.&lt;ref name=WVZ15&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed human nature to be a single concept, where the rational soul and spiritual soul must co-occur for a human being to exist.&lt;ref name=WVZ15/&gt; A human being would be considered a corpse with no potential for living when it lacked either of the two souls.&lt;ref name=WVZ15/&gt; Sabuco agreed with [[Aristotle|Atristotle's]] vision of form and matter in relation to the body: they both believed the interaction between the mind and body was the formal organization of a whole living human being.&lt;ref name=WVZ16&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Her theory differed in the sense that the human being could not exist until the divine soul/mind coexisted with the body/matter.&lt;ref name=WVZ16/&gt;

Her approach to the mind–body interaction mirrored that of [[Plato|Plato’s]].  The mind was in charge of moral judgments and reasons which caused the body to react in certain ways.  Therefore, the body carried out the moral judgments that were processed. Sabuco placed emphasis on self-knowledge and the capacity of the mind to exercise free will.  Self-knowledge and ethical decisions allowed hope, health, strength and a natural life span to be placed on the human body while free will directed the passions and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harmony and a healthy state===
According to Sabuco, the soul was divided into three parts: the sensitive, the biological, and the intellectual soul, all which would be in a harmonic balance with one another.&lt;ref name=WVZ17&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The balance between the four humors, hot, cold, wet, and dry must also be in harmony in order for the human organ system to be in a healthy state.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; Sabuco used a temperature-humidity schema, derived from [[Hippocrates]], to evaluate illnesses and individuals’ state of health.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; Although her ideas originated from Hippocrates’s [[humorism|four bodily humors]], Sabuco denied the importance of his theory and insisted the focus lie on the severity of temperature and humidity.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; For example, illnesses, disabilities and premature death were results of disharmony among the three parts of the soul or the temperature-humidity schema.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; Sabuco also coined the term chilo, which was a white liquid energizing force that traveled through a complex network of anatomical channels from one organ system to another.&lt;ref name=WVZ18&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Chilo maintained the proper temperature and humidity within the body; nonetheless, an imbalance could lead to negative states of health.&lt;ref name=WVZ18/&gt;  The purpose of chilo was to communicate movement to the bodily organs and orient them to carry out the goal meant to be accomplished.&lt;ref name=Waithe264&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral philosophy===
Sabuco’s theory of moral philosophy incorporated traditional views of virtue ethics. Good and evil were intertwined in the world and could banish each other.&lt;ref name=WVZ27&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Her theory stated how something good could be present in evil and something evil could be present in good.&lt;ref name=WVZ27/&gt; There was never such a concept as pure evil or pure good. Within her theory of human nature only two evils existed, avoidable diseases and premature aging.&lt;ref name=WVZ27/&gt; Sabuco promoted moderation and temperance to control emotions and passions; her theory originated from Plato’s concept of [[sophrosyne]], where self-understanding is used to obtain wisdom and virtue.&lt;ref name=WVZ27/&gt; However, she referenced temperance as the most important virtue that was obtained through self-knowledge. Temperance and wisdom were then labeled as the answers to evil because they sustained human life and provided peace, happiness, and content between emotions and the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===

The second part of her work described astronomical and geological events and how they support the theory of human nature. It was important to learn how the [[macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]] functions because humans were a [[macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] within the board world.&lt;ref name=Waithe268/&gt; Understanding how the world came to be would teach humans how to live in that world.&lt;ref name=Waithe268/&gt; A person's condition, whether improving or declining was related to cosmology.&lt;ref name=Waithe268/&gt; Such topics included the moon, the magnitude of the Earth and its atmosphere, solar and lunar eclipses and the magnitude of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's life cycle would improve or decline just like a moon's cycle would be waxing or waning.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Within macrocosm, the moon was defined as the brain of the world which provided moisture and growth to its waters.&lt;ref name=Pomata49&gt;Pomata 2010, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Microcosm, on the other hand, described the sun as the heart of the world which gave warmth and life to the world.&lt;ref name=Pomata49/&gt; The emphasis was placed on the brain, making it more significant than the heart, as the moon was more vital than the sun.&lt;ref name=Pomata49/&gt;

===World improvements: judicial, legislative, and social thoughts===

Sabuco introduced smaller systems of reformation into her idea of human nature. Sabuco advocated for the creation of legislative, judicial and social reforms in the welfare rights of the powerless, people such as peasants, workers and householders.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; The powerless were the ones whose health was severely impacted the most by the misery and despair of everyday life.&lt;ref name=Pomata6&gt;Pomata 2010, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Excess and greed should be avoided because they were bad for the social and individual body.&lt;ref name=Pomata6/&gt;

She argued for a legal reformation of judicial laws, doctrines of appeals and better protection under the law. She reasoned that the individuals who created the laws would be the only ones who would comprehend them.&lt;ref name=WVZ29&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the laws would not be applicable or fair to lower socioeconomic classes who did not partake in the creation of them. Laws must be clear, written in simple language and precise so proper justice could be granted to the poor.&lt;ref name=WVZ29/&gt; Sabuco also argued against juridical doctrines of appeal to authority figures of Roman law.&lt;ref name=WVZ30&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Authoritarian power was passed down through generations and individuals' verdicts had varying interpretations from previous generations of authorities who lacked knowledge about the present case.&lt;ref name=WVZ30/&gt;  As a result, she believed protection under the law was unequal for most of the public and most did not receive proper justice.&lt;ref name=WVZ30/&gt;

Legislative reformation should include protection for farmers and peasants because their labor and production was essential in the survival of others within the nation. She was a strong proponent of preventing the authority from confiscating land, livestock, and crops.&lt;ref name=WVZ31&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabuco criticized university policies and the objectives of the education system. She mentioned the lack of proper criteria for an individual regarding admissions and recommended examiners evaluate potential candidates' abilities when granting admission. She also denounced the importance of charging students tuition because students were admitted who could afford tuition but lacked the proper aptitude to succeed.&lt;ref name=WVZ31/&gt;

===Physical medicine and remedies===

Sabuco disagreed with the traditional medical theory and thought its failure to control medicine was due to people's ignorance on the  impact of emotions on physical health.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotions such as anger, sadness, love, excessive joy, hatred, shame and distrust caused imbalances in the bodily humors which squeezed the humor and humidity out of the brain where the soul was located.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; The only true appropriate medicine would comfort the brain and be in accordance between the body and the soul.&lt;ref name=WVZ24&gt;Waithe, Vintro &amp; Zorita 2007, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Words and deeds that generated joy and hope and taking care of the stomach were the three pillars of health that could comfort the brain.&lt;ref name=WVZ24/&gt; If optimism, contented happiness and abdominal temperature were left unattended they could lead to sorrow, discontent and melancholy.&lt;ref name=Pomata6&gt;Pomata 2010, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Another general remedy mentioned was the diversion of humor through bodily openings so it would not reach internal organs.&lt;ref name=Pomata6/&gt;

==Treatise==

The book, published in [[Madrid]] in 1587, was called ''Nueva Filosofia de la Naturaleza del Hombre (New Philosophy of Human Nature)''.&lt;ref name=W1,3,10&gt;Waithe 2007, p. 1, 3, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of seven separately titled treatises.&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt; The first five, ''Knowledge of One’s Self'',''Composition of the World as It Is'', ''Things That Will Improve This World and Its Nations'', ''Treatments and Remedies of Proper Medicine'', and ''Proper Medicine Derived from Human Nature''' are written in the [[Castilian language]].&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt;  While the last two, ''Brief Exposition on Human Nature: The Foundations of the Art of Medicine'', and ''Proper Philosophy of the Nature of Composite Things, of Humans, and of the World, Unknown to the Ancients'', are written in [[Latin]].&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt;  This book, in its entirety, was dedicated to [[Philip II of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gentleman's,'' p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first treatise within Sabuco’s most famous book, ''New Philosophy of Human Nature'', introduces a discussion between three peasants, whom she identified as shepherds and who critique the views of others.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; These three shepherds continue as the main characters throughout the remaining six treatises and their discussions cover various topics of human nature. The identity of her characters represents the significance of remaining in close contact with nature and staying isolated from society so societal views will not sully the mind.&lt;ref name=WVZ17/&gt; She purposely included peasants as characters in order to demonstrate how philosophy and medicine are relevant regardless of social class.&lt;ref name=Waithe3&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Sabuco believed her theory should be relevant to simple folks and applicable to their lives.&lt;ref name=Waithe3/&gt; The  treatises emphasized the universe by describing the theory on mutual interdependence of the soul, body, and cosmos.&lt;ref name =Waithe265/&gt;
  
In the pages of her treatise she explored many ideas amongst which are the comparison of a human body to an upside down tree.&lt;ref name=G240&gt;''Gentleman's,'' p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the brain, like in the root of a tree, that all diseases begin and it is possible to cure them through various methods amongst which are words of cheerfulness, sound thought, and even to the hearing of music.&lt;ref name=G240/&gt; The process of using wise words against violent emotions such as anger, she called "Rhetorical Insinuation" because it explored the idea of being able to persuade the will through words.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn 1998, p. 875.&lt;/ref&gt; She explored how emotions have an effect on the human body and how one can control their effects by focusing on the chief organ of the body, the brain.&lt;ref name=Winters&gt;Winters 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Father Feyjoo, much of the research she did contributed to the ability of physicians following her to develop some of the first theories around nervous diseases.&lt;ref name=G240/&gt;

Going back to the idea of the brain as King, she wrote how during sleep the brain was feed all its necessary nutrients, which have been, throughout the day, collected in the stomach.&lt;ref name=Barona&gt;Barona 1993, p. 176, 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the nutrients were taken to the brain and nervous fluid was created, it was allocated throughout the body by a fluid aside from red blood.&lt;ref name=Barona /&gt; Some have postulated that she was referring to a concept similar to white blood cells when she wrote this for she makes mention of a fluid white in color nourishing the body with information.&lt;ref name=Winters /&gt;

==Fame and influence==

Her work has sometimes been compared with [[Descartes]]' ''[[Passions of the Soul|The Passion of the Soul]]'', for like him she imagined the seat of the soul to be in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Keitt 2005, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; We know that she was famous in her day because in 1604, while she was still alive, Franciscio Lopez de Uveda, a physician and poet from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], expressed that a character he was working on would out fame people like Oliva Sabuco and [[Don Quixote]], thus implying her name to be one associated with fame.&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt; In addition to this, the famous French physician Charles le Pois cited Sabuco’s influence on his own views regarding diseases such as hysteria.&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt;

==Summary==

Without definitively solving the mind body problem, Sabuco moves philosophy a step in that direction by providing both a new chemical explanation, with white fluid as a vehicle of mind body interaction, and an explanation of the role of emotions on physical health.&lt;ref name=W1,3,10/&gt;

==Later life==
Credit for her work was sometimes given to her father, Don Miguel Sabuco y Alvarez, because of a powerful letter written by him claiming the work as his own.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; His letter and a promissory note written by Sabuco's husband and brother were implemented a year following the publication of the book.&lt;ref name=Waithe264/&gt; The letter claimed Don Miguel Sabuco as the true author of ''New Philosophy of Human Nature'' and an explanation stating that her name was included in an attempt to honor her but she had no legal interest in the volume nor authority over it.&lt;ref&gt;Waithe 1989, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent scholarship has defended her case, claiming that she was the writer. Because of the nature of her material, she incurred the attention of the [[Spanish Inquisition|inquisitors]] and had all her books burned.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke 1995, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; She lived out her days in the convent of Dominican nuns in Alcaraz and took on a monastic habit.&lt;ref name = Cannon /&gt; There, she eventually died around the year 1622.&lt;ref name = Cannon /&gt;

'''Paul Marie Ghislain Otlet''' ({{IPAc-en|ɒ|t|ˈ|l|eɪ}}; {{IPA-fr|ɔtle|lang}}; 23 August 1868 – 10 December 1944) was a Belgian author, entrepreneur, visionary, lawyer and peace activist; he is one of several people who have been considered the father of [[information science]], a field he called "documentation". Otlet created the [[Universal Decimal Classification]], one of the most prominent examples of [[faceted classification]]. Otlet was responsible for the widespread adoption in Europe of the standard American 3x5&amp;nbsp;inch [[index card]] used until recently in most library catalogs around the world (by now largely displaced by the advent of the [[OPAC|online public access catalog]] (OPAC)). Otlet wrote numerous essays on how to collect and organize the world's knowledge, culminating in two books, the ''{{lang|fr|[[Traité de Documentation]]}}'' (1934) and ''{{lang|fr|Monde: Essai d'universalisme}}'' (1935).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Buckland, [http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/otlet.html Paul Otlet, Pioneer of Information Management], biography of Paul Otlet for the School of Information at UC Berkeley, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Wright, [http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/forgotten_forefather_paul_otlet Forgotten Forefather, Paul Otlet.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603161002/http://boxesandarrows.com/view/forgotten_forefather_paul_otlet |date=3 June 2012 }}, Boxes and Arrows, Nov. 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, following a huge international conference, Otlet and [[Henri La Fontaine]] created the Central Office of International Associations, which was renamed to the [[Union of International Associations]] in 1910, and which is still located in [[Brussels]]. They also created a great international center called at first {{lang|fr|Palais Mondial}} (World Palace), later, the [[Mundaneum]] to house the collections and activities of their various organizations and institutes.

Otlet and La Fontaine were [[peace activist]]s who endorsed the internationalist politics of the [[League of Nations]] and its [[International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation]] (the forerunner of [[UNESCO]]). Otlet and La Fontaine witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of information, resulting in the creation of new kinds of international organization. They saw in this organization an emerging global [[polity]], and wished to help solidify it.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} La Fontaine won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1913.

== Early life and career ==
Otlet was born in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] on 23 August 1868, the oldest child of Édouard Otlet (Brussels 13 June 1842-[[Blanquefort, Gironde|Blanquefort]], [[France]], 20 October 1907) and Maria (née Van Mons). His father, Édouard, was a wealthy businessman who made his fortune selling [[tram]]s around the world. His mother died in 1871 at the age of 24, when Otlet was three. Through his mother, he was related to the ''Van Mons'' family, a prosperous family, and to the Verhaeren family, of which [[Emile Verhaeren]] was one of the most important Belgian poets.

His father kept him out of school, hiring tutors instead, until he was 11, believing that classrooms were a stifling environment. Otlet, as a child, had few friends, and played regularly only with his younger brother Maurice. He soon developed a love of reading and books.

At the age of six, a temporary decline in his father's wealth caused the family to move to Paris. At the age of 11, Paul went to school for the first time, a [[Jesuit]] school in [[Paris]], where he stayed for the next three years. The family then returned to Brussels, and Paul studied at the prestigious [[Collège Saint-Michel]]&lt;ref&gt;Alain Deneef and Xavier Rousseaux (eds.), ''Quatre siècles de présence jésuite à Bruxelles'', Kadoc, no. 58, Louvain, 2012. {{ISBN|9782930682006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in Brussels. In 1894, his father became a [[senator]] in the [[Belgian Senate]] for the [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] (until 1900). His father remarried to Valerie Linden, daughter of famed botanist [[Jean Jules Linden]]; the two eventually had five additional children. The family travelled often during this time, going on holidays and business trips to [[Italy]], France and [[Russia]].

Otlet was educated at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] and at the {{lang|fr|[[Université Libre de Bruxelles]]}}, where he earned a law degree on 15 July 1890. He married his step-cousin, Fernande Gloner, soon afterward, on 9 December 1890. He then clerked with famed lawyer [[Edmond Picard]], a friend of his father's.

Otlet soon became dissatisfied with his legal career, and began to take an interest in [[bibliography]]. His first published work on the subject was the essay "Something about bibliography", written in 1892. In it he expressed the belief that books were an inadequate way to store information, because the arrangement of facts contained within them was an arbitrary decision on the part of the author, making individual facts difficult to locate. A better storage system, Otlet wrote in his essay, would be cards containing individual "chunks" of information, that would allow "all the manipulations of classification and continuous interfiling." In addition would be needed "a very detailed synoptic outline of knowledge" that could allow classification of all of these chunks of data.

In 1891, Otlet met [[Henri La Fontaine]], a fellow lawyer with shared interests in bibliography and international relations, and the two became good friends. They were commissioned in 1892 by Belgium's Societé des Sciences sociales et politiques (Society of social and political sciences) to create bibliographies for various of the social sciences; they spent three years doing this. In 1895, they discovered the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]], a library classification system that had been invented in 1876. They decided to try to expand this system to cover the classification of facts that Otlet had previously imagined. They wrote to the system's creator, [[Melvil Dewey]], asking for permission to modify his system in this way; he agreed, so long as their system was not translated into English. They began work on this expansion soon afterwards and thus created the [[Universal Decimal Classification]].

During this time, Otlet and his wife then had two sons, Marcel and Jean, in quick succession.

Otlet founded the {{lang|fr|Institut International de Bibliographie}} (IIB) in 1895, later renamed as (in English) the [[International Federation for Information and Documentation]] (FID).

== The Universal Bibliographic Repertory ==
[[File:Mundaneum Tiräng Karteikaarten.jpg|thumb|Répertoire Bibliographique Universel]]
In 1895, Otlet and La Fontaine also began the creation of a collection of index cards, meant to catalog facts, that came to be known as the "{{lang|fr|Repertoire Bibliographique Universel}}" (RBU), or the "Universal Bibliographic Repertory". By the end of 1895 it had grown to 400,000 entries; later it would reach more than 15 million entries.

In 1896, Otlet set up a fee-based service to answer questions by mail, by sending the requesters copies of the relevant index cards for each query; scholar Charles van den Heuvel has referred to the service as an "analog [[search engine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cataloguing the World: Paul Otlet and the Birth of the Information Age (in Introduction)|first= Alex |last=Wright|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1912, this service responded to over 1,500 queries a year. Users of this service were even warned if their query was likely to produce more than 50 results per search.

Otlet envisioned a copy of the RBU in each major city around the world, with Brussels holding the master copy. At various times between 1900 and 1914, attempts were made to send full copies of the RBU to cities such as Paris, [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]; however, difficulties in copying and transportation meant that no city received more than a few hundred thousand cards.

== The Universal Decimal Classification ==
In 1904, Otlet and La Fontaine began to publish their classification scheme, which they termed the [[Universal Decimal Classification]]. The UDC was originally based on Melvil Dewey's Decimal classification system. Otlet and La Fontaine contacted Melvil Dewey to inquire if they could modify the Dewey Decimal System to suit the perimeters of their bibliographic project, namely, organizing information in the social and natural sciences.  Dewey granted them permission as long as it substantially differed from his original version. &lt;ref&gt;Rayward, W. 1. (1997). The origins of information science and the International Institute of Bibliography/International Federation for Information and Documentation (FID). ''Journal Of The American Society For Information Science, 48'', 289-300.&lt;/ref&gt; They worked with numerous subject experts, for example with [[Herbert Haviland Field]] at the [[Concilium Bibliographicum]] for Zoology, and completed this initial publication in 1907. The system defines not only detailed subject classifications, but also an algebraic notation for referring to the intersection of several subjects; for example, the notation &lt;nowiki&gt;"31:[622+669](485)"&lt;/nowiki&gt; refers to the [[statistics]] of [[mining]] and [[metallurgy]] in [[Sweden]]. The UDC is an example of an analytico-synthetic classification, i.e., it permits the linking of one concept to another. Although some have described it as faceted, it is not, though there are some faceted elements in it. A truly faceted classification consists solely of simple concepts; there are many compound concepts listed in the UDC. It is still used by many libraries and bibliographic services outside the English-speaking world, and in some non-traditional contexts such as the [[BBC Archives]].

== Personal difficulties and World War I ==
In 1906, with his father Édouard near death and his businesses falling apart, Paul and his brother and five step-siblings formed a company, {{lang|fr|Otlet Frères}} ("Otlet Brothers") to try to manage these businesses, which included mines and railways. Paul, though he was consumed with his bibliographic work, became president of the company. In 1907, Édouard died, and the family struggled to maintain all parts of the business. In April 1908, Paul Otlet and his wife began divorce proceedings. Otlet remarried in 1912, to Cato Van Nederhesselt.

In 1913, La Fontaine won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], and invested his winnings into Otlet and La Fontaine's bibliographic ventures, which were suffering from lack of funding. Otlet journeyed to the [[United States]] in early 1914 to try to get additional funding from the U.S. Government, but his efforts soon came to a halt due to the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Otlet returned to Belgium, but quickly fled after it became occupied by the Germans; he spent the majority of the war in Paris and various cities in [[Switzerland]]. Both his sons fought in the Belgian army, and one of them, Jean, died during the war in the [[Battle of the Yser]].

Otlet spent much of the war trying to bring about peace, and the creation of multinational institutions that he felt could avert future wars. In 1914, he published a book, "{{lang|fr|La Fin de la Guerre}}" ("The End of War") that defined a "World Charter of Human Rights" as the basis for an international federation.

== The Mundaneum ==
{{main|Mundaneum}}

In 1910, Otlet and La Fontaine first envisioned a "city of knowledge", which Otlet originally named the "{{lang|fr|Palais Mondial}}" ("World Palace"), that would serve as a central repository for the world's information. In 1919, soon after the end of World War I, they convinced the government of Belgium to give them the space and funding for this project, arguing that it would help Belgium bolster its bid to house the [[League of Nations]] headquarters. They were given space in the left wing of the {{lang|fr|[[Cinquantenaire|Palais du Cinquantenaire]]}}, a government building in [[Brussels]]. They then hired staff to help add to their Universal Bibliographic Repertory. 

In 1921 Otlet wrote to [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] offering the use of the Palais Mondial for the [[Pan-African_Congress#2nd_Pan-African_Congress|2nd Pan-African Congress]]. Although both Otlet and Fontaine offered a warm welcome to the Congress, these sentiments were not shared across all of Belgian society. The Brussels based paper ''Neptune'' stated that the organisers – particularly the [[National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People]] were funded by the [[Bolsheviks]] and raised concern that it might lead to difficulties in the [[Belgian Congo]] by drawing together "all the ne’er-do-wells of the various tribes of the Colony, aside from some hundreds of labourers.”&lt;ref name="Colonial and Coloured Unity"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Padmore |first1=George |title=Colonial and Coloured Unity: A Programme of Action; History of the Pan-African Congress, edited by George Padmore 1947 |date=1947 |publisher=The Hammersmith Bookshop |location=London |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/padmore/1947/pan-african-congress/ch05.htm |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palais Mondial was briefly shuttered in 1922, due to lack of support from the government of Prime Minister [[Georges Theunis]], but was reopened after lobbying from Otlet and La Fontaine. Otlet renamed the Palais Mondial to the Mundaneum in 1924. The RBU steadily grew to 13 million index cards in 1927;  by its final year, 1934, it had reached more than 15 million.&lt;ref name="xanadu"&gt;[[W. Boyd Rayward]] [http://people.lis.uiuc.edu/~wrayward/otlet/xanadu.htm "Visions of Xanadu: Paul Otlet (1868-1944) and Hypertext."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227184732/http://people.lis.uiuc.edu/~wrayward/otlet/xanadu.htm |date=27 December 2005 }}, ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science'' 4(4):235-250.  May 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Index cards were stored in custom-designed cabinets, and indexed according to the Universal Decimal Classification. The collection also grew to include files (including letters, reports, newspaper articles, etc.) and images, contained in separate rooms; the index cards were meant to catalog all of these as well. The Mundaneum eventually contained 100,000 files and millions of images.

In 1934, the Belgian government again cut off funding for the project, and the offices were closed. (Otlet protested by keeping vigil outside the locked offices, but to no avail.) The collection remained untouched within those offices, however, until 1940, when [[Germany]] invaded Belgium. Requisitioning the Mundaneum's quarters to hold a collection of [[Third Reich]] art and destroying substantial amounts of its collections in the process, the Germans forced Otlet and his colleagues to find a new home for the Mundaneum. In a large but decrepit building in [[Leopold Park]] they reconstituted the Mundaneum as best as they could, and there it remained until it was forced to move again in 1972, well after Otlet's death.

== The World City ==
The World City or Cité Mondiale is a utopian vision by Paul Otlet of a city which like a universal exhibition brings together all the leading institutions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;In 2011 [http://www.architectuur.ugent.be/en/department/staff/wouter-van-acker/ Wouter Van Acker] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120717155012/http://www.architectuur.ugent.be/en/department/staff/wouter-van-acker/ |date=17 July 2012 }} completed  his PhD on the visionary schemes and schemas of Paul Otlet.&lt;/ref&gt; The World City would radiate knowledge to the rest of the world and construct peace and universal cooperation. Otlet’s idea to design a utopian city dedicated to international institutions was largely inspired by the contemporary publication in 1913 by the Norwegian-American sculptor [[Hendrik Christian Andersen]] and the French architect [[Ernest Hébrard]] of an impressive series of Beaux-Arts plans for a World Centre of Communication (1913). For the design of his World City, Otlet collaborated with several architects. In this way a whole series of designs for the World City was developed. The most elaborated plans were: the design of a Mundaneum (1928) and a World City (1929) by [[Le Corbusier]] in Geneva next to the palace of the League of Nations, by Victor Bourgeois in Tervuren (1931) next to the Congo Museum, again by Le Corbusier (in collaboration with Huib Hoste) on the left bank in Antwerp (1933), by Maurice Heymans in Chesapeake Bay near Washington (1935), and by Stanislas Jassinski and Raphaël Delville on the left bank in Antwerp (1941). In these different designs the program of the World City stayed more or less fixed, containing a World Museum, a World University, a World Library and Documentation Centre, Offices for the International Associations, Offices or Embassies for the Nations, an Olympic Centre, a residential area, and a park.

== Exploring new media ==
Otlet integrated new media, as they were invented, into his vision of the networked knowledge-base of the future. In the early 1900s, Otlet worked with engineer [[Robert Goldschmidt]] on storing bibliographic data on [[microfilm]] (then known as "micro-photography"). These experiments continued into the 1920s, and by the late 1920s he attempted along with colleagues to create an encyclopedia printed entirely on microfilm, known as the ''{{lang|la|Encyclopaedia Microphotica Mundaneum}}'', which was housed in the Mundaneum. In the 1920s and 1930s, he wrote about radio and television as other forms of conveying information, writing in the 1934 ''{{lang|fr|Traité de documentation}}'' that "one after another, marvellous inventions have immensely extended the possibilities of documentation." In the same book, he predicted that media that would convey feel, taste and smell would also eventually be invented, and that an ideal information-conveyance system should be able to handle all of what he called "sense-perception documents".

==Political views and involvement==
Otlet was a firm believer in international cooperation to promote both the spread of knowledge and peace between nations. The [[Union of International Associations]], which he had founded in 1907 with [[Henri La Fontaine]], later participated to the development of both the [[League of Nations]] and the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]], which was later merged into [[UNESCO]].

In 1933, Otlet proposed building in Belgium near [[Antwerp]] a "gigantic neutral [[World City]]" to employ a massive number of workers, in order to alleviate the unemployment generated by the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,744944-1,00.html Work for All the World], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 23 January 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fade into obscurity ==
Otlet died in 1944, not long before the end of World War II, having seen his major project, the Mundaneum, shuttered, and having lost all his funding sources. According to Otlet scholar [[W. Boyd Rayward]]:

: "The First World War marked the end of the intellectual as well as sociopolitical era in which Otlet had functioned hitherto with remarkable success. After the war, he and his schemes were never taken seriously except with the circle of his disciples. He quickly lost the support of the Belgian government. In the late 1920s he faced the defection of his followers in the International Institute of Documentation, as the International Institute of Bibliography " &lt;ref&gt;W. Boyd Rayward, "Visions of Xanadu: Paul Otlet (1868–1944) and Hypertext", ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science'' 4(4), May 1994, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

And:

: "Perhaps at one level, Otlet, is best regarded as a fin de siècle figure whose work enjoyed a considerable measure of acceptance and support at home and abroad before World War I. But after the War, it rapidly lost favour. Once influential nationally and internationally, at least in a relatively specialised circle, Otlet came to be regarded as difficult and obstructive as he grew old. His ideas and the extraordinary institutional arrangements in which they had finally come to be expressed, the Palais Mondial or Mundaneum, seemed grandiose, unfocused and passé. In the early 1930s there was a quietly dramatic struggle to remove the International Institute of Bibliography, transformed eventually into the International Federation for Documentation, from this institutional complex and from under what was considered to be the dead hand of the past - effectively the hand of the still very much alive but ageing Otlet." &lt;ref&gt;W. Boyd Rayward,  "Knowledge organisation and a new world polity:the rise and fall and rise of the ideas of Paul Otlet", ''Transnational Associations'', no. 1-2 (2003), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of [[World War II]], the contributions of Otlet to the field of information science were lost sight of in the rising popularity of the ideas of American information scientists such as [[Vannevar Bush]], [[Douglas Engelbart]], [[Ted Nelson]] and by such theorists of information organization as [[Seymour Lubetzky]].

== Rediscovery ==
Beginning in the 1980s, and especially after the advent of the [[World Wide Web]] in the early 1990s, new interest arose in Otlet's speculations and theories about the organization of knowledge, the use of information technologies, and globalization. His 1934 masterpiece, the ''Traité de documentation'', was reprinted in 1989 by the [[Centre de Lecture publique de la Communauté française]] in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.ugent.be/handle/1854/5612|title=Traité De Documentation (original manuscript)|format=PDF|website=archive.ugent.be|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607052400/https://archive.ugent.be/handle/1854/5612|archivedate=7 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Neither the Traité nor its companion work, "Monde" (World) has been translated into English so far.) In 1990 Professor W. Boyd Rayward published an English translation of some of Otlet's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2142/4004 |title=International Organisation and Dissemination of Knowledge (original manuscript)|format=PDF|website=hdl.handle.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published a biography of Otlet (1975) that was translated into Russian (1976) and Spanish (1996, 1999, and 2005).

In 1985, Belgian academic [[André Canonne]] raised the possibility of recreating the Mundaneum as an archive and museum devoted to Otlet and others associated with them; his idea initially was to house it in the Belgian city of [[Liège (city)|Liège]]. Cannone, with substantial help from others, eventually managed to open the new Mundaneum in  [[Mons]], Belgium in 1998.  This museum is still in operation, and contains the personal papers of Otlet and La Fontaine and the archives of the various organizations they created along with other collections important to the modern history of Belgium.

== Analysis of Otlet's theories ==

Otlet scholar W. Boyd Rayward has written that Otlet's thinking is a product of the 19th century and the philosophy of [[positivism]], which holds that, through careful study and the [[scientific method]], an objective view of the world can be gained. According to W. Boyd Rayward, his ideas placed him culturally and intellectually in the [[Belle Époque]] period of pre–World War I Europe, a period of great "cultural certitude".

Otlet's writings have sometimes been called prescient of the current [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-man-who-envisioned-the-internet-before-computers-without-computers?trk_source=popular|title=The Man Who Envisioned the Internet Before Computers, Without Computers|work=Motherboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; His vision of a great network of [[knowledge]] was centered on [[document]]s and included the notions of [[hyperlink]]s, [[search engine]]s, remote access, and [[social network]]s—although these notions were described by different names.&lt;ref&gt;Charles van den Heuvel, "Building Society, Constructing Knowledge, Weaving the Web". In: W. Boyd Rayward, ed., ''European Modernism and the Information Society. Informing the Present, Understanding the Past''. Aldershot 2008, pp. 127-153&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Otlet laid out this vision of the computer and internet in what he called “Radiated Library” vision.&lt;ref name= "Fox News article" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2012/06/07/internet-was-invented-in-134-sorta/|title=The Internet was invented in 1934 (sorta)|work=Fox News|first=Sean |last=Captain |date=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8667">'''Practical idealism''' is a term first used by [[John Dewey]] in 1917 and subsequently adopted by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] (''Gandhi Marg'' 2002). It describes a philosophy that holds it to be an ethical imperative to implement ideals of virtue or good. It further holds it to be equally immoral to either refuse to make the compromises necessary to realise high ideals, or to discard ideals in the name of expediency. Practical idealism in its broadest sense may be compared to [[utilitarianism]] in its emphasis on outcomes, and to [[political economy]] and [[enlightened self-interest]] in its emphasis on the alignment of what is right with what is possible.
   
== International affairs ==
In [[foreign policy]] and [[international relations]], the phrase "practical idealism" has come to be taken as a theory or set of principles that diplomats or politicians use to describe or publicize their outlook on foreign policy. It purports to be a pragmatic compromise between [[Realism in international relations|realism]], which stresses the promotion of a state's "narrow" and amoral self-interest, and [[Idealism in international relations|idealism]], which aims to use the state's influence and power to promote higher [[Liberal international relations theory|liberal ideals]] such as peace, justice, and co-operation between nations. In this view, realism is seen as a prescription for [[Machiavellian]] selfishness and ruthlessness in international relations. Machiavelli recommended political strategies for reigning, or potential, princes; the infamous teachings gravitate around his vision of the overarching and ultimate goal of any Prince, remaining in power. These strategies range from those that, today, might be called moderate or liberal political advice to those that, today, might be called illegal, immoral or, in the U.S., unconstitutional. For better or worse, Machiavelli is by name, like novelist George [[Orwellian|Orwell]], modernly associated with manipulative acts and philosophies that disregard civil rights and basic human dignity in favor of deception, intimidation, and coercion. This extreme form of realism is sometimes considered both unbecoming of nations' aspirations and, ultimately, morally and spiritually unsatisfying for their individual people. Extreme idealism, on the other hand, is associated with moralist naiveté and the failure to prioritize the interests of one's state above other goals.

More recently, practical idealism has been advocated by [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] and [[Philip D. Zelikow]], in the position of counselor to the department. The latter has defended the foreign policy of the [[George W. Bush]] administration as being "motivated in good part by ideals that transcend narrow conceptions of material self-interest." Zelikow also assesses former [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] as practitioners of practical idealism.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''SECRETARY RICE''': Well, American foreign policy has always had, and I think rightfully had, a streak of idealism, which means that we care about values, we care about principle. It's not just getting to whatever solution is available, but it's doing that within the context of principles and values. And at a time like this, when the world is changing very rapidly and when we have the kind of existential challenge that we have with terrorism and extremism, it's especially important to lead from values. And I don't think we've had a president in recent memory who has been so able to keep his policies centered in values.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The responsibility, then, of all of us is to take policies that are rooted in those values and make them work on a day-to-day basis so that you're always moving forward toward a goal, because nobody believes that the kinds of monumental changes that are going on in the world or that we are indeed seeking are going to happen in a week's time frame or a month's time frame or maybe even a year's time frame. So it's the connection, the day-to-day operational policy connection between those ideals and policy outcomes. - Condoleezza Rice, ''Washington Post'' interview
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Singapore]]an diplomat and former ambassador to the [[United Nations]] Dr. Tommy Koh quoted [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] [[U Thant]] when he described himself as a practical idealist:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If I am neither a Realist nor a Moralist, what am I? If I have to stick a label on myself, I would quote U Thant and call myself a practical Idealist. I believe that as a Singaporean diplomat, my primary purpose is to protect the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and economic well-being of the state of Singapore. I believe that I ought to pursue these objectives by means which are lawful and moral. On the rare occasions when the pursuit of my country's vital national interest compels me to do things which are legally or morally dubious, I ought to have a bad conscience and be aware of the damage which I have done to the principle I have violated and to the reputation of my country. I believe that I must always consider the interests of other states and have a decent regard for the opinion of others. I believe that it is in Singapore's long-term interest to strengthen international law and morality, the international system for curbing the use of force and the institutions for the pacific settlement of disputes. Finally, I believe that it is in the interests of all nations to strengthen international co-operation and to make the world's political and economic order more stable, effective and equitable. — "Can Any Country Afford a Moral Foreign Policy?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics have questioned whether practical idealism is merely a slogan with no substantive policy implications. (Gude 2005)

== U.S. presidential politics ==
The phrase practical idealism also was used as a slogan by John Kusumi who ran as an independent candidate in the 1984 presidential elections. This was the first introduction of the phrase in U.S. presidential politics. (United Press International 1984) (New Haven Journal Courier 1984) (New Haven Register 1984)

Former Democratic Vice President Al Gore also used the phrase in the 1990s, as did Republican Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in the 2000s.

American political scientist Jack Godwin elaborates on the doctrine of practical idealism in ''The Arrow and the Olive Branch: Practical Idealism in US Foreign Policy''.

In [[Dzogchen]], '''rainbow body'''
({{bo|t=འཇའ་ལུས་|w=&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;ja' lus}}, '''Jalü''' or '''Jalus''') is a level of realization. This may or may not be accompanied by the 'rainbow body phenomenon'. The rainbow body phenomenon is a religious topic which has been treated fairly seriously for centuries, including in the modern era. Other [[Vajrayana]] teachings also mention rainbow body phenomena.

==Rigpa==
{{main|Rigpa}}
[[File:Dzogchen A.png|thumb|Tibetan letter "A" inside a thigle. The "A", which corresponds to the sound ‘ahh’,{{sfn|Norbu|2002|page=56}} represents kadag while the thigle represents ''lhun grub''.]]

The rainbow body phenomenon is a third person perspective of someone else attaining complete knowledge ({{bo|t=རིག་པ|w=[[rigpa]]}}). Knowledge is the absence of delusion regarding the display of the [[Ground (Dzogchen)|basis]].

[[Rigpa]] has three wisdoms, which are ''kadag'', ''lhun grub'' and ''thugs rje''. Kadag deals with ''[[Kadag Trekchö|tregchöd]]''.{{sfn|Garry|2005|page=296}} The ''lhun grub'' aspect has to do with esoteric practices, such as (but not limited to) [[Thödgal]], that self-liberate the human body into a [[Sambhogakāya]] (rainbow body phenomenon).{{sfn|Garry|2005|page=296}}{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|page=32}} The symbol of Dzogchen is a Tibetan "A" wrapped in a ''thigle''. The "A" represents ''kadag'' while the ''thigle'' represents ''lhun grub''. The third wisdom, ''thugs rje'' (compassion), is the inseparability of the previous two wisdoms.

In Dzogchen, a fundamental point of practice is to distinguish ''rigpa'' from ''sems'' (mind).{{sfn|Kunsang|2012|page=154}}

The ultimate fruition of the thodgal practices is a body of pure light, called a rainbow body ([[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]] '' 'ja' lus'', pronounced ja lü.){{sfn|Ray|2001|page=323}} If the four visions of thogal are not completed before death, then during death, from the point of view of an external observer, the dying person starts to shrink until he or she disappears. Usually fingernails, toenails and hair are left behind{{sfn|Norbu|1999|pages=158-161}} (see e.g. [[Togden Ugyen Tendzin]], [[Ayu Khandro]], [[Nyala Rinpoche|Changchub Dorje]]). The attainment of the rainbow body is typically accompanied by the appearance of lights and rainbows.{{sfn|Ray|2001|page=323}}

Exceptional practitioners are held to realize a higher type of rainbow body without dying. Having completed the four visions before death, the individual focuses on the lights that surround the fingers.  His or her physical body self-liberates into a nonmaterial body of light (a ''[[Sambhogakāya]]'') with the ability to exist and abide wherever and whenever as pointed by one's compassion.{{sfn|Rangdrol|Matthieu|2001|page=153}}

==Eyewitness account==
Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen's ''Heart Drops of Dharmakaya'', a Kunzang Nyingtic Dzogchen meditation manual commentated on by Lopon Tenzin Namdak, contains an eyewitness account of his main students' bodies shrinking and rainbows appearing in the sky at death.{{sfn|Gyaltsen|2002|pages=135-137}}

'''Ramin Jahanbegloo''' ({{lang-fa| رامین جهانبگلو}}, born 1956 in [[Tehran]]) is an [[Iran]]ian [[philosopher]] and academic who is based in Canada.

==Biography==
Ramin Jahanbegloo was born in Tehran, Iran. He has a doctorate in [[philosophy]] from [[Sorbonne University]] in Paris, France where he lived for twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/27/books/27jaha.html?_r=2&amp;ref=world&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | title=An Iranian in India, Encouraging Dialogue | first=Somini | last=Sengupta | date=December 27, 2007 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a post-doctorate fellow in Middle Eastern Studies at [[Harvard University]]. He is married to Azin Moalej and had a daughter named Afarin Jahanbegloo, the cousin of renowned Persian philosopher and scholar, [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranianpoliticalprisoners.org/reports.php?id=7]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic and intellectual career ==
Jahanbegloo's intellectual activity focuses on fostering constructive dialogue between divergent cultures. He has written numerous books and articles in [[Persian language|Persian]], English and French on the subject of [[Western philosophy]] and [[modernity]]. In 1991 he published his book ''Conversations with Isaiah Berlin'' in French, which was translated into English and published the following year. The book records a series of interviews with the famous philosopher [[Isaiah Berlin]], which cover intellectual questions ranging from the moral philosophy of Tolstoy to the meaning of liberalism. Between the years 1997-2001, he was an adjunct professor of Political Science at the [[University of Toronto]] in Canada.

In 2001, he served at the [[National Endowment for Democracy]] as a fellow at the a federally funded program, known as the [[Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellows Program]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ned.org/forum/past.html#Ramin%20Jahanbegloo Fellowship Programs - Past Fellows&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415023119/http://www.ned.org/forum/past.html |date=2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to Tehran, he was appointed head of the Contemporary Philosophy Department of the Cultural Research Center. In his efforts to promote dialogue, he has interviewed [[scholars]] and [[intellectuals]] from all over the world, among them [[George Steiner]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Ashis Nandy]] and the [[Dalai Lama]]. In recent years, he invited [[Richard Rorty]], [[Timothy Garton Ash]], [[Antonio Negri]], and [[Michael Ignatieff]] and other Western intellectuals to Iran.

==Political detention==
In late April 2006, on his way to an international conference in [[Brussels]], Jahanbegloo was arrested by the Iranian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4970120.stm | work=BBC News | title=Iranian author arrested in Tehran | date=May 3, 2006 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, Iran judiciary branch officials confirmed that he was arrested and sent to  [[Evin Prison]]. According to some sources, he was accused of [[spying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8502130481|title=خبرگزاری فارس - جهانبگلو به دلايل امنيتي بازداشت شده است|author=|date=3 May 2006|website=Farsnews.com|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, a friend told [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] News that Jahanbegloo had been moved to a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2006/05/04/jahanbegloo-iran.html|title=Jailed Iranian-Canadian now in hospital, friend told - CBC News|author=|date=|website=Cbc.ca|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]] expressed concern over Jahanbegloo being detained without charges and called for his immediate release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/05/05/iran13312.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-05-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506015641/https://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/05/05/iran13312.htm |archive-date=2006-05-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hrw.org/persian/press/2006/iran050406pr.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-05-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506123638/http://hrw.org/persian/press/2006/iran050406pr.pdf |archive-date=2006-05-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Canadian newspaper reports on May 6, Jahanbegloo's friends suspected that he was being tortured. Their fears increased in the wake of reports that Jahanbegloo had been examined twice at the medical clinic of Evin Prison, a detention facility for political prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=47895263-87d6-49fc-a26e-82cf110e52a2&amp;k=72702|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614114139/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=47895263-87d6-49fc-a26e-82cf110e52a2&amp;k=72702|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 June 2006|title=Friends fear detained Iranian-Canadian has been tortured|author=|date=14 June 2006|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Iranian newspaper, ''Jomhuri Eslami'', accused Jahanbegloo of links to the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the [[Mossad]]. "He is considered as one of the key elements in the American plan for the smooth toppling" of the Islamic regime", the newspaper stated, further charging that he was being paid by the United States to conduct "cultural activities against Iran."

On May 13, the [[Defenders of Human Rights Center]] (DHRC), an Iranian human rights group headed by Iran's [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Shirin Ebadi]], voiced concern over the arrest and jailing of the prominent intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060514/wl_mideast_afp/iranjusticepoliticsdissident_060514094227] {{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1068394.html|title=Iran's Ebadi Voices Concern Over Detained Intellectual|author=|date=|website=Rferl.org|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, the [[Council of the European Union]], following a meeting in [[Brussels]], issued a press release expressing concerns about the detention of Jahanbegloo, including its underlying message that Iranians ought not to communicate or associate with Europeans: 
::"The Council is seriously concerned about the detention of the Iranian philosopher Dr. Ramin Jahanbegloo.

On May 19, more than 400 prominent international figures, including Nobel laureates, scholars and human rights activists, in an open letter demanded Jahanbegloo's immediate release.

On June 29, 2009, commenting on post-election chaos, Iranian minister of intelligence said, "there is no practical possibility of a velvet revolution in Iran" though he accused United States and Britain of trying to orchestrate one.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} He disclosed that people such as Ramin Jahanbaglou and [[Haleh Esfandiari]] had been arrested in connection with such foreign assisted plots to instigate the Iranian intelligentia but due to legal complications, no prosecution could take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/2009/06/090629_ir88_after_election_eczehie_mousavi.shtml|title=وزیر اطلاعات: به موسوی گفتم این مسیر به جایی نمی رسد|author=|date=|website=BBC News فارسی|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Hönigswald''' (18 July 1875 in [[Magyar-Óvár]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (the present [[Mosonmagyaróvár]] in [[Hungary]]) – 11 June 1947 in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]) was a well-known [[philosopher]] belonging to the wider circle of [[Neo-Kantianism]].

==Biography==
Hönigswald studied [[medicine]] and [[philosophy]] under [[Alois Riehl]] and [[Alexius von Meinong]] and from 1916 was professor of philosophy, [[psychology]] and [[pedagogy]] in [[Breslau]] (now [[Wrocław]]). There he supervised [[Norbert Elias]]'s doctorate up to its conclusion in 1924. From 1930 he was a professor at [[Munich]]. The emphasis of his work lay on the [[theory of cognition]] from the point of view of validation and the philosophy of language. Beyond that, Hönigswald tried to develop a method of teaching that would be applicable to the natural sciences and the humanities equally. He also dealt with questions of the psychology of thought and of pedagogy. 

In 1933, as a Jew, he was compulsorily retired. At the time of the [[Kristallnacht]] (''The Night of Broken Glass'') in 1938, he spent three weeks in [[Dachau concentration camp]]. In 1939 he emigrated with his wife and daughter by way of [[Switzerland]] to the [[United States]].

==Life==
Richard Rufus who studied at [[University of Paris|Paris]] and at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] starting from the 1220s. He became a Franciscan around 1230. Rufus was one of the first medieval philosophers to write on [[Aristotle]] and his commentaries are the earliest known among those which have survived. He also wrote influential commentaries on [[Peter Lombard]]'s ''Sentences''. Rufus was influenced by [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Alexander of Hales]], [[Richard Fishacre]], and [[Johannes Philoponus]], and in turn influenced [[Bonaventure]] and [[Franciscus Meyronnes]]. [[Roger Bacon]] was a fervent critic of Rufus, claiming that his fame was greatest with the ignorant multitude; on the other hand, [[Thomas of Eccleston]] praised him as an excellent lecturer. [[Adam de Marisco]] describes him in a letter to Grosseteste as "a man lacking in command of the English tongue, yet of most honest conversation and unblemished reputation, learned in human and divine literature." The reason given for his lack of proficiency with English is that he was primarily a [[Cornish language|Cornish]] speaker.

[[File:Missel dominicain MG 2117.jpg|thumb|[[Dominican Rite|Dominican]] [[Missal]], c. 1240, with rubrics in red (Historical Museum of [[Lausanne]])]]
[[File:Gradual of King John Albert.jpg|thumb|Rubrics in an illuminated [[gradual]] of ca. 1500]]
A '''rubric''' is a word or section of text that is traditionally written or printed in [[red]] ink for emphasis. The word derives from the {{lang-la|rubrica}}, meaning [[red ochre]] or red [[chalk]],&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] meaning 1a.&lt;/ref&gt; and originates in [[Medieval]] [[illuminated manuscript]]s from the 13th century or earlier. In these, red letters were used to highlight initial capitals (particularly of [[psalms]]), section headings and names of religious significance, a practice known as [[rubrication]], which was a separate stage in the production of a [[manuscript]].

Rubric can also mean the red ink or paint used to make rubrics, or the [[pigment]] used to make it.&lt;ref&gt;OED meaning 1b&lt;/ref&gt; Although red was most often used, other colours came into use from the late [[Middle Ages]] onwards, and the word rubric was used for these also.

Various figurative senses of the word have been extended from its original meaning. Usually these senses are used within the set phrase "under [whatever] rubric," for example, "under this rubric, [X is true]," or "[X was done] under the rubric of Y." These senses are defined in part by ''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate''&lt;ref name="MWCD_headword_rubric"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |title=headword "rubric" |work=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |edition=11th |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rubric |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows: "an authoritative rule"; "the title of a statute"; "something under which a thing is classed: CATEGORY"; "an explanatory or introductory commentary: GLOSS"; "an established rule, tradition, or custom"; "[[rubric (academic)|a guide listing specific criteria for grading or scoring academic [assignments] ]]."&lt;ref name="MWCD_headword_rubric"/&gt; (See ''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate''&lt;ref name="MWCD_headword_rubric"/&gt; for the full listing.)

==As liturgical instructions==
Instructions for a priest explaining what he must do during a [[liturgy]] were also rubricated in [[missal|missals]] and the other liturgical books, and the texts to be spoken aloud were in black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13216a.htm|title=Rubrics|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this, "rubric" has a secondary denotation of an instruction in a text, regardless of how it is actually inscribed. This is the oldest recorded definition in English, found in 1375.&lt;ref&gt;OED meaning 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Less formally, "rubrics" may refer to any liturgical action customarily performed, whether or not pursuant to a written instruction. The history, status, and authority of the content of rubrics are significant, and sometimes controversial, among liturgical scholars. In the past, some theologians distinguished between rubrics they considered of Divine origin and those merely of human origin. Rubrics were probably originally verbal, and then written in separate volumes. The earliest extant liturgical books do not contain them, but from references in texts of the first millennium it appears that written versions existed.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia, article cited.&lt;/ref&gt; Full rubrics regarding matters such as [[vestment|vesture]], appearance of the [[altar]], timing of specific liturgies, and similar matters still may be published separately. In modern liturgical books, e. g. the [[Catholic]] ''[[Roman Missal]]'', lengthy general rubrics, probably printed in black, pertain to such matters and preface the actual order of liturgies, which contain shorter, specific rubrics that still are usually rubricated. Red is also often used to distinguish words spoken by the celebrant and those by the congregation, or by other specific persons involved in the liturgy, e. g. those marrying.

==After the development of printing==
[[File:Kelmscott Press Laudes Beatae Mariae Virginis.png|thumb|right|Page from the 1896 Kelmscott Press edition of the 13th century ''Laudes Beatae Mariae Virginis'', with numbers and first lines of the [[Psalms]] rubricated in between prayers in black.&lt;ref name="WM" /&gt;]]
With the arrival of [[printing]], other typographic effects such as [[italic type]], bolded type, or different sizes of type, were used to emphasize a section of text, and as printing in two colours is more expensive and time consuming, [[rubrication]] has tended to be reserved for sacred and liturgical books or luxury editions of other works.

[[William Morris]]'s medievally inspired typography for the [[Kelmscott Press]] at the end of the 19th century included chapter titles and other accents in red, or rarely blue, ink, and was influential on [[small press]] art typography associated with the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in both [[England]] and the [[United States]], particularly the work of the [[Ashendene Press|Ashendene]], [[Doves Press|Doves]], and [[Roycroft]] Presses.&lt;ref name="WM"&gt;Parry, Linda: ''William Morris'', New York: Harry Abrams, 1996, {{ISBN|0-8109-4282-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Naylor, Gillian: "The Things That Might Be: British Design after Morris".  In Diane Waggoner, ed.: ''The Beauty of Life: William Morris &amp; the Art of Design'', New York: Thames and Hudson, 2003, {{ISBN|0-500-28434-2}}, p. 122-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1900, [[rubrication]] was incorporated into a [[Red letter edition]] of the King James Version of the [[Bible]] to distinguish the Dominical words, i. e., those spoken by [[Jesus Christ]] during His corporeal life on Earth, because that translation lacked quotation marks. Other versions of the [[Bible]] have since adopted the popular practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2805">'''Samuel ibn Seneh Zarza''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''שמואל אבן סנה''') was a [[Jews of Spain|Spanish]] philosopher who lived at [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] in the second half of the 14th century. According to [[Zunz]], his surname is derived from the Spanish town [[Zarza (disambiguation)|Zarza]] (= "thorn-bush"), and is accordingly synonymous with the Hebrew "seneh." Of his life no details are known, for while in his notes on the ''[[Sefer ha-Yuḥasin]]'' (ed. Filipowski, p.&amp;nbsp;226) [[Samuel Shullam]] states that Zarza was burned at the stake by the tribunal of Valencia on the denunciation of [[Isaac Campanton]], who accused him of denying the creation of the world, historians have proved this assertion a mere legend.&lt;ref&gt;David Kaufmann, "Shullam's Report of the Burning of Samuel Zarza: A Legend Based on a Name" ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'', Vol. 11, No. 4 (Jul., 1899), pp. 658-662.  Zarza's main activity was in the 1360s and 1370s; Campanton was born in 1360.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a comparatively unimportant writer, if his two works may serve as a criterion, Zarza ranked high in the estimation of his contemporaries, so that the poet [[Solomon Reubeni]] of Barcelona and the astronomer [[Isaac ibn al-Ahdab|Isaac ibn Al-Ḥadib]] (in 1377) composed poems in his honor.

Zarza was the author of the ''Meḳor Ḥayyim,'' a philosophical commentary on the [[Pentateuch]] (1368; [http://hebrewbooks.org/6145 printed Mantua, 1559]), and of the ''Miklol Yofi,'' a philosophical commentary devoted to the [[haggadot]] found in both [[Talmud]]im and divided into 151 chapters and seven parts (Neubauer, ''Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS.'' No. 1296). In the introduction to the latter work Zarza draws a melancholy picture of the state of the Jews of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] in his time, stating that in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] alone 10,000 perished in the course of the war between [[Peter of Castile]] and his half brother [[Henry II of Castile]]. In his ''Meḳor Ḥayyim,'' Zarza mentions four other writings of his which are no longer in existence: ''Ṭaharat ha-Ḳodesh,'' on the principles of religion, ''Eẓem ha-Dat'', ''Ẓeror ha-Mor'', and ''Magen Abraham.''

* '''The Tradition of Enlightenment in the West and Islam''' (Tehran: Amir Kabir, 1389/2009, {{ISBN|978-964-00-1231-4}}): This book  make a comparison between the Islamic peripatetic philosophy and the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] philosophy of the eighteenth century, in detail. That means it is seeking to present a  philosophical reading from the western modernity and enlightened intellectual reading from the Islamic philosophy. In the fact, this book criticizes two dominated thinking on the Islamic world: this fact that the outrace of Islamic philosophy is transcendent wisdom and the matter that Islamic philosophy is not but Islamic theology and accordingly philosophy. Also, it has a positivistic look at the enlightenment philosophy and its latent redeemer matters.

'''Semiology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] σημεῖον ''sēmeion'', "a sign, a mark") is a branch of [[Gregorian Chant]] research. Semiology refers specifically to the study of the [[neume]]s as found in the earliest fully notated manuscripts of [[Gregorian Chant]], the oldest of which have been dated to the 9th century. The first application of the term 'semiology' (which first appeared in the 1960s) for the study of Latin chant was made by Dom [[Eugène Cardine]] (1905–1988), a monk of the Abbey of [[Solesmes Abbey|Solesmes]]. In this context, 'semiology' is understood as 'the study of musical signs'.  Text and neumatic notation, together with significative letters adjoined to the neumes, presents an effective and integrated [[mnemonic]] for the rhythmical interpretation and the melody. While Gregorian palaeography offers a description of the various neumes and their rhythmical and melodic values, Gregorian semiology explains their meaning for practical interpretation. 

==History of Gregorian chant ==
In the 19th century, [[palaeography|palaeographical]] work relating to chant was done in various places in Europe against the background of a performance style based on proportional durational values that were assigned to various deteriorated forms of chant used in various locales.

The main player in the history of Gregorian chant semiology in the 19th century is the [[Benedictine]] community of the [[Solesmes Abbey|Abbey of St Peter in Solesmes]], which was established in 1833 by Fr [[Prosper Guéranger]], who wished to create single authoritative editions of chant via paleographical study.  This led to the scholarly monks of the abbey, chief among whom was Dom Paul Jausions, spending over half a century finding and copying the most ancient chant manuscripts.  Under Guéranger, the monks of Solesmes advocated singing Gregorian chant in a free musical metre giving the majority of sung notes the same durational length.  This interpretation was contrary to much contemporary practice elsewhere and at odds with scholars who backed the use of long and short notes related in strict durational proportion as per polyphonic singing.

The publication of Gontiér's ''Méthode Raisonée de plain-chant'' (1859) was followed by [[Joseph Pothier|Dom Pothier]]'s ''Mélodie Grégorienne d'après la tradition'' (1880) in which he advocated singing the chant in 'rythme oratoire' (oratorical rhythm), which still involved giving the majority of sung notes the same durational length.  In 1889, Dom [[André Mocquereau]] initiated the ''Paleographie Musicale'' periodicals which saw the publication of ''facsimiles'' of most ancient chant manuscripts to make them more accessible to scholars.  Dom Pothier disapproved of this initiative.

In his third volume of ''Études de science musicale'', published in 1898, Antoine Dechevrens laid out a comprehensive system of interpreting the neumes of Sankt Gallen style in proportional note lengths.  Peter Wagner's ''Neumenkunde'' (1905) volume set out the various musical signs of all the most ancient notational styles historically and paleographically, including Jewish and Byzantine neumes, while providing a number of facsimile illustrations, giving rhythmically proportional values for the musical signs along with a few examples of proportional interpretations of certain chants in modern Western European notation.

The [[Holy See]] set up a commission which ran from 1904 till 1913, headed by Pothier, and an editorial team, run by Mocquereau, to create official chant editions for the Vatican. Mocquereau's editorial team only lasted a year: owing to editorial disagreements with Mocquereau, Pothier ended up in charge of the editing which, amongst other things, led to the production of a revised [[Graduale Romanum]] in 1908.  Mocquereau published ''Le nombre musical grégorienne ou rhythmique grégorienne'' (two volumes) in 1908 &amp; 1927, in which he presented his own understanding of Gregorian rhythm, several elements of which have since been generally discredited.  Two elements which have not been discredited are the recognition of the existence of note lengthening, and the notion of 'nuancing', i.e., altering note durations by very small, non-proportional values.  One-note syllables were declared to be normally short in duration, their written length being interpreted as 'graphic licence'.

In 1934, Dom Gregory Murray's anti-proportionalist ''A Pilgrim's Progress'' was published.  In the same year, a series of articles on the subject of the rhythmic quantities of Gregorian musical signs began to be published, entitled 'La Question Rhythmique Grégorienne' by the Abbé G Delorme.  This work concluded that certain notational styles contained two distinct signs for any single note and that this difference must be related to rhythm rather than pitch.

The next person to work out a comprehensively coherent analysis of the various neumes and their rhythmic durations was Dr Jan Vollaerts.  Using comparative analysis of all the material available to him, Vollaerts was able to show the internal logic and coherence in the neumatic notation with regard to a proper articulation of the verbal-melodic line.  In his posthumously published book, 'Rhythmic Proportions in Early Medieval Ecclesiastical Chant' (Brill, 1958), where the term 'semiotic' is used, tables are presented of neumes of different notational styles once used in various parts of Europe (e.g., [[Nonantola]], [[Laon]], [[Brittany]], [[Aquitaine]], [[Switzerland]]).  One-note, two-note, three-note neumes as found in the various notations are dealt with chapter by chapter.  The neumes of one-note syllables were declared to be generally long in duration, as marked in Nonantola and Laon notation.

In the book, singing chant to proportional durations is advocated.  This is supported in the book by the evidence of Latin medieval theoretical writings which overwhelmingly advocate singing note lengths according to long and short notes bearing durations defined by simple ratios.  Certain of the same writings criticise any lengthening or shortening of these ratios, although certain writings also recognise that such practice existed.

In a [[volte face]], Dom Gregory Murray published two booklets, presenting the same views as Vollaerts. In 1957, he published ''Gregorian Rhythm in the Gregorian Centuries; the Literary Evidence'' which presented excerpts from the medieval theoretical writings in English and Latin.  In 1959, he published ''The Authentic Rhythm of Gregorian Chant'' which statedly presented, in edited fashion,
Delorme's and Vollaerts' arguments.

This work was followed in 1968 by the book 'Semiologia Gregoriana' by Dom Eugène Cardine.  In this book, a fairly comprehensive table of the [[neume]]s used by the school of Sankt Gallen is presented. Unlike Fr. Vollaerts, Dom Cardine did not view the musical signs as representing proportional note values, and he viewed one-note syllables in Sankt Gallen notation as normally representing a short duration.  Unlike Vollaerts, Cardine did not present all the styles of notation to the reader for examination, which means that the reader had no access to certain notations, such as those of Nonantola and Laon, which mark most one-note syllables with a sign indicating a lengthening of duration.

Vertical, from top to bottom, in the first column, Cardine starts off with neumes representing a single note, then two-, three- and four-note groups and many compound neumes and ornamental neumes. Horizontally, Cardine enters all the variations of the main neume.  The system of neumes used in most of the earliest notational styles is rhythmically complex and sophisticated, particularly the styles of Laon and [[Einsiedeln Abbey]].

Cardine states that natural speech-rhythms provide a rhythmic basis for the declamation of Gregorian chant.  He divides syllabic time into three categories: "normal" "enlarged, more heavy" and "light, more liquid".  Under this interpretation, a one-note syllable would not be considered usually "long" or "longer".

Cardine was employed as a teacher of palaeography and semiology by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] from 1952 to 1984 at the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music in Rome.  His work in the field of semiology was recognized and supported by commissions and led to the publication of the 'Graduale Triplex' in 1979, which was based on Cardine's personal [[Roman Gradual]] in which, over the years, he had copied many neumes from Sankt Gallen school manuscripts. Two students of Cardine, Rupert Fischer and M.C. Billecocq, undertook the strenuous task to manually copy the neumes of two schools of generally concordant rhythmic manuscripts (Einsiedeln/Sankt Gallen and Laon) into the new type-set Roman Gradual of 1974.  In hindsight, the 'Graduale Triplex' proved a great stimulus for self-study as it made important material available in a handy book. The momentum of its publication has created a demand for a new Gradual as the 1974 Gradual contains many incidental or structural melodic errors. As a response to this need and following the Holy See's invitation to edit a more critical edition, in 2011the first volume "De Dominicis et Festis" of the "Graduale Novum Editio Magis Critica Iuxta SC 117"was published by Libreria Editrice Vatican and ConBrio Verlagsgesellschaft, Regensburg.  

The growing number of [[choir]]s or scholae that perform Gregorian Chant according to these developments are thus said to follow the 'semiological approach'. The International Society for the Study of Gregorian Chant (Associazione Internazionale Studi di Canto Gregoriano) carries on the legacy of Eugène Cardine, putting special emphasis on bridging the gap between Gregorian research and praxis. The Society has some 500 members in 30 countries worldwide.

Other students of Cardine, who, like Fischer and Billecocg, held a professorate at the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music]] in Rome or other church music institutes, include Marie-Noel Colette, Luigi Agustoni, Johannes Berchmans Göschl and Godehard Joppich.

A smaller school of singing chant using proportional durations, as per Fr Vollaerts, has continued in the hands of Jan van Biezen in the Netherlands, R John Blackley in Maine, USA, and Luca Ricossa in Switzerland.

In the 1983 "Liber Hymnarius" from Solesmes, it is stated that, "When an ordinary syllable is set to one note, this represents the fundamental rhythmic value used in Gregorian chant (i.e. valor syllabicus medius)."  This implies that the one-note syllable (and thus the fundamental rhythmic value of chant) is no longer interpreted by Solesmes as being normally short in duration.

'''Shedra''' is a Tibetan word (བཤད་གྲྭ, bshad grwa) meaning "place of teaching" but specifically refers to the educational program in Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and nunneries. It is usually attended by monks and nuns between their early teen years and early twenties. Not all young monastics enter a shedra; some study ritual practices instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yust|2006|p=181}}; {{harvnb|Brown|Armington|Whitecross|2007|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shedra is variously described as a university, monastic college, or philosophy school. The age range of students typically corresponds to both [[secondary school]] and [[college]]. After completing a shedra, some monks continue with further scholastic training toward a [[Khenpo]] or [[Geshe]] degree, and other monks pursue training in ritual practices.

== Curriculum ==
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
The curriculum varies with the lineage and monastery&lt;ref name="Stewart|2004|p=134"&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|2004|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most cover the main foundational texts in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon]], such as the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' (''The Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way'') by [[Nagarjuna]] and the ''[[Madhyamakāvatāra]]'' (''Entering the Middle Way'') by [[Candrakīrti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gyamtso|2003|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some non-Buddhist courses, such as grammar, poetry, history, and arts may be included.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lobel|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial years focus on the Buddhist ''[[Sūtra|sutras]]'' and the remaining years on ''[[tantras]].'' Care is taken to introduce foundational topics first, building key concepts and vocabulary for later study.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ray|2002|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to western educational systems, the shedra places much greater emphasis on memorization by students. Some traditions require monks memorize complete texts before studying them. They may be required to recite in class the new sections they've memorized each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dreyfus|2003|pp=79–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some lineages, debate becomes a major focus and practice for refining one's understanding. In those lineages students may spend a major portion of the day in debate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gyatso|1998|pp=70–72}}; {{harvnb|Dreyfus|2003|pp=195, 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are differing views on the importance of shedra. [[Gelug]], [[Sakya]] and [[Jonang]] lineages consider the shedra training essential, whereas in the [[Nyingma]] and [[Kagyu]] lineages, this is less the case.&lt;ref name="Stewart|2004|p=134"/&gt;

=== Five topics ===
{{main|Tibetan_Buddhist_canon#Five_traditional_topics_of_study|l1=Five traditional topics of study}}
[[Je Tsongkhapa]] standardized the Tibetan Buddhist curriculum into five major topics, and this was later adopted by many other schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ray|2002|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Pāramitā]]s - study of Mahayana
# [[Madhyamaka]] - philosophy
# [[Pramana]] - logic and epistemology
# [[Abhidharma]] - psychology
# [[Vinaya]] - monastic rules

=== Gelug lineage ===
The shedra system at [[Sera Monastery]], now relocated to southern India from Tibet, has a twelve- to twenty-year curriculum organized in the five topics. The first five years are foundational and cover logic, epistemology, vinaya, and the terms and distinctions built upon in later philosophic study. The next four years are devoted to studying specific texts, including Candrakīrti's ''Madhyamakavatara'', Maitreya's ''[[Abhisamayalankara]]'', and [[Dharmakirti| Dharmakīrti]]'s ''[[Pramanavarttika]]''. The remaining four to eight years continue with [[Vasubandhu]]'s ''Treasury of Manifest Knowledge'' and Gunaprabha's ''Vinayamula Sutra'', and, for some students, study of [[Guhyasamāja tantra]].&lt;ref name="berotsana.org"&gt;{{harvnb|Levinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nyingma lineage ===
[[Image:Namdroling shedra.jpg|thumb|Monks entering the shedra at Namdroling|353x353px]]
The shedra at [[Namdroling Monastery]] includes specific phases of study with particular texts used in each phase. Commentaries by [[Ju Mipham]] or [[Khenpo Shenga]]&lt;ref name="berotsana.org"/&gt; may be used with each text.

== History ==
Monastic education and a tradition of scholarship was not unique to Tibet, but was imported when Buddhism was brought from India initially by [[Shantarakshita]]. Major Buddhist universities such as [[Nalanda]] University existed as places for advanced studies in India up until the twelfth century.

== Early years (1949–1983) ==
=== Family background ===
Sri Bhagavan was born on 7 March 1949 as Vijay Kumar, in Natham Village, [[Gudiyatham]] Town, [[Vellore]] district, [[Tamil Nadu]], to Smt. Vaidarbhi Amma and Sri Varadarajulu. Sri Bhagvan’s father was the head of the accounts department of [[Indian Railways]] and his mother was a simple village woman. In 1955, when Sri Bhagavan was 6 years of age, the family moved to [[Madras|Chennai]].

=== Education ===

Sri Bhagavan attended [[Don Bosco Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Chennai|Don Bosco School]] in [[Chennai]]. Later, he graduated from [[DG Vaishnav College]] in [[Chennai]], majoring in [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Narayanan, Dr. Vasudha, "A `White Paper' on Kalki Bhagavan, 29 September 2002", University of Florida, Gainesville, Montclair. |url=https://msuweb.montclair.edu/~adarkara/d-kalki.html |website=msuweb.montclair.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===

Sri Bhagavan married Smt. Padmavathi on 9 June 1977. This was an arranged marriage following the prevalent customary practice in India for marriages decided by elders in the family.{{sfn|Ardagh|2008|loc=Chapter 1,2}} Padmavathi, who is addressed as '''Amma''' by their students, takes an interest and participation in building the spiritual organization Oneness.{{sfn|Ardagh|2008|loc=Chapter 1,2}}

== Jeevashram School (1984–1994) ==
[[Jeev]][[ashram]] School located in [[Chittoor]] District, [[Andhra Pradesh]] was founded by Sri Bhagavan, in July 1984 to provide an alternative form of education. The land for the school was taken on a lease, with the support provided by Hari Khoday, an Indian philanthropist. As director of the school, Sri Bhagavan's focus was to develop an environment for children to truly flower and discover themselves. The school had 180 residential students and 200 day students from nearby villages.{{sfn|Ardagh|2008|loc=Chapter 1,2}} It was at this school that his spiritual work began. In the summer of 1989, one of the students reported a mystical experience of divine silence. Soon, many other students reported similar experiences, and they were also able to pass their experiences to one another. During these experiences, children had vision of various Gods and would converse with them.  Sri Bhagavan explained that the children had got in touch with [[Antaryamin]], ''the inner guide who dwells in your heart'' that guides all beings towards greater truth.{{sfn|Ardagh|2008|loc=Chapter 1,2}} In 1991, Sri Bhagawan decided to close the school and start the spiritual work for the larger community. The school was closed a few years later in 1994, after the senior students had all graduated from high school and the remaining students were moved to other schools.{{sfn|Ardagh|2008|loc=Chapter 1,2}}

== Spiritual programs for public (1991–present) ==
Once the decision was made to close Jeevashram School, work started in developing the spiritual programs for the public.{{sfn|Ardagh|2008|loc=Chapter 1,2}} The principal of the Jeevashram School with a small group of teachers started the spiritual programs for public. The workshops were conducted as residential retreat programs conducted over 7 days or 21 days.

The workshop focused on helping the participant ''accept themselves as they are'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Varughese | first = Suma  | work = Life Positive | title = Sri Bhagawan Kalki - The School of Enlightenment }} The class revolves around the concept of acceptance. Sounding like [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|J. Krishnamurti]] or [[Eckhart Tolle]], she tells us to practice 'sweekariyat', beginning with acceptance of the self. We are urged to look within and acknowledge all that is. She points out the suffering inherent in rejecting aspects of ourselves we do not approve of and of the false self we construct. She emphasizes the importance of 'experiencing' the moment, instead of resisting it. Bhagavan says, "Seeing is the key thing in the [[dharma]]. Supposing jealousy is there, you must learn to see jealousy. To see is to be free." http://lifepositive.com/the-school-for-enlightenment/&lt;/ref&gt; and connect with their ''own inner divine self'' the [[Antaryamin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Varughese | first = Suma  | work = Life Positive | title = Sri Bhagawan Kalki - The School of Enlightenment }} "Bhagavan says, 'The mind of man is like a wall which divides man from God. The deeksha is an electrical energy that makes a hole in this wall, which we call the mind. Once this happens, then God and man can come to relate to each other." "God is your supreme friend," Bhagavan is reported to have said, and we are urged to argue with God, fight with him and compel him to hear our prayer, as we would with a real friend. I find this concept of the friendly God very attractive, for too often we distance ourselves from divinity out of a sense of unworthiness. http://lifepositive.com/the-school-for-enlightenment/&lt;/ref&gt;

Students also reported various spiritual experiences including mystical visions of their own personal God riding a white horse, similar to the [[Kalki]] form of [[Vishnu]] from traditional [[Hindu eschatology|Hindu beliefs]].&lt;ref name="RA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Monier Monier-Williams]]: Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages, 1889, reprinted 2003, Nataraj Books, Asian Educational Services, {{ISBN|81-206-0369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this shared spiritual experiences, the students and public would address Sri Bhagavan with the title "Kalki".&lt;ref name="RA"/&gt;

A second campus was set up in 1992 near [[Chennai]] city a place called Somangalam. In 1994, the campus of Jeevashram School was renamed as [[Satyaloka]]. Advance retreat programs for public were conducted at this campus.  By 1995, Sri Bhagavan's workshops were being conducted in all major cities in India. In 1995, the first major public event was held at Chennai city, attracting more than 100,000 students from across India. In 1999, the work on building the Oneness University{{sfn|Ardagh|2008|loc=Chapter 2}}  at [[Varadaiahpalem]], [[Chittoor district|Chittoor]] district  [[Andhra Pradesh]]  India started. Oneness University, located 70&amp;nbsp;km from [[Chennai]], is accessible by the National Highway 5 and is on Tirupati Road leading to the ancient temple town of [[Kalahasthi]]. In 2000, the first campus was completed and Sri Bhagavan and his team of teachers moved to the campus. Over the next few years, various campuses, including the Oneness Temple in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Avadhani | first = Ramesh  | work = Religiscope | title = India: A visit to the Oneness Temple of Amma-Bhagawan}} Constructed by the Oneness organisation in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, a new temple boasts of the largest pillar-less meditation hall in Asia--able to accommodate 8000 people. What is this building, and what is the Oneness movement, about which there are few studies? Indian journalist Ramesh Avadhani has recently visited the place. In the following document, he reports about his experience.  http://english.religion.info/2008/07/13/india-a-visit-to-the-oneness-temple-of-amma-bhagwan/&lt;/ref&gt; were built. In 2004, the first international program was started.{{sfn|Ardagh|2008|loc=Chapter 2}}

[[Anna Hazare]] the Indian social reformer, states ''"All over India, oneness is the only University providing the values which have not been provided by any other University"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vamsigrandhi.blogspot.hk/2011/08/anna-hazare-visited-oneness-university.html Sunday, August 21, 2011, Anna Hazare Visited Oneness University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moZ2AwfDU6Q Anna Hazare Comments on Youth Course of Oneness University]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ervin Laszlo]] of the Budapest Club, avers that the 'Oneness experience' are as real as any human sense perceptions of light, colour and sound, but conveyed via different neural process within the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Nadkarni | first = Vithal | work = Economic Times | title = Oneness to the rescue of a world in peril }} http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/oneness-to-the-rescue-of-a-world-in-peril/articleshow/2732690.cms
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Tony Robbins]], the well known American businessman and coach, discovered meditation through his visit to Oneness University, and has since incorporated teachings of Sri Bhagavan as part of his own programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://fortune.com/2014/10/30/tony-robbins-best-advice-executive-coach/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, about 600 delegates from India and 36 others converged at Sri Bhagavan's Oneness University campus for the international convention of the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]]. This program was attended by various well-known figures, such as [[Ashok Singhal]], [[Praveen Togadia]], and [[Giriraj Kishore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Correspondent | first = Special | work = The Hindu | title = world convention | date = 2009-01-02}} [http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/article366033.ece?textsize=small&amp;test=2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''VHP condemns terrorism'' [http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vhp-condemns-terrorism/article368356.ece (The Hindu)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-known visitors to Sri Bhagavan's Oneness University campus include [[Bollywood]] stars [[Shilpa Shetty]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/shilpa-shetty-in-silent-mode/article13726.ece Shilpa Shetty in silent mode | The Hindu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manisha Koirala]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Varma | first = Lipika | work = Deccan Chronicle | title = On her trip to Chennai, Manisha}}[[Manisha Koirala]] states, "I go away to Oneness University in Chennai – this is a totally different company, where we all live differently and see life differently. And when I–m in their company, I get engrossed completely and get detached to the worldly affairs. Here we go for hiking, sit down in nature and enjoy meditation for hours together and discuss about the being of life and blah…blah. Getting attached spiritually, I get easily detached to the world – this detachment gives me a different satisfaction- gain a lot of peace. I gain clarity and get a sense of bliss, and for me it's another dimension of life which I enjoy. So I’m looking ahead to be with all my Sadhvis ahead in the next month. I usually do this every six months in a year's time."

[[File:Exhibition Suiseki and Shangshi Prague 2011 2257.jpg|thumb|Suiseki and its wooden base at "Exhibition Suiseki and Shangshi" in Prague, 2011]]

{{nihongo|'''Suiseki'''|水石}} are small naturally occurring or shaped [[rock (geology)|rocks]] which are traditionally appreciated.  They are similar to [[Chinese scholar's rocks]].&lt;ref name="cousins244"&gt;Cousins, Craig. (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=7w-arIGpmfEC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=  ''Bonsai Master Class,'' p. 244].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chinese scholar's rocks influenced the development of ''suiseki'' in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Brokaw, Charles. (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=T51TNiU9460C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=  ''The Temple Mount Code,'' p. 73].&lt;/ref&gt;  The history of ''suiseki'' in Japan begins during the reign of [[Empress Suiko]].  The small objects were brought to Japan as gifts from the Chinese Imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;Corvello, Vincent T. and Yūji Yoshimura. (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=o-87ZrlXIzAC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq= ''The Japanese Art of Stone Appreciation: Suiseki and Its Use With Bonsai,'' p. 17].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Suiseki'' are usually presented in two different ways:

*The stone is provided with a wooden base (Daiza).
*The stone is placed in a waterproof tray or bowl of ceramic (suiban) or bronze (Doban).

These stones are not just any stones which can be found in nature; they must be expressive stones and have a special shape, color and texture to be categorized as ''suiseki''. There is a distinction between landscape and object stones. The former reflect landscapes such as mountains, lakes or rivers, while other stones have object shapes that resemble animals or sculptures.

The stones are of natural origin and are found in rivers, oceans and karst areas. They are not allowed to be reshaped. An exception is the cutting of stones to have a flat base, so they can be placed stably on a Daiza, suiban or Doban, to be displayed properly. This diminishes their value, in the eyes of purists.

==Evaluation==
The evaluation of ''suiseki'' recognizes subtlety of color, shape, markings and surface.  According to {{nihongo|Hideo Marushima|丸島秀夫|Marushima Hideo|1934-&amp;nbsp;}} in {{nihongo| ''The History of Suiseki in Japan''|日本愛石史|Nihon aisekishi|}},
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not a silly thing at all to enjoy a stone in a tray. I see the whole world in a tiny stone. Some objects in this world are huge, and others are small, and they come in all shapes, but they are not that different when you look at their essence.&lt;ref&gt;Rivera, Felix G. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vgr2MAYajMIC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=  ''Suiseki: The Japanese Art of Miniature Landscape Stones,'' p. 40], citing {{nihongo|''The History of Suiseki in Japan''|日本愛石史|Nihon aisekishi}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Popular types of ''suiseki'' suggest a mountain, a waterfall, an island, a thatched hut or an animal.&lt;ref name="cousins244"/&gt;

[[File:Sun Deng.jpg|thumb|Long-haired Sun Deng playing the one-stringed zither in his mountain cave]]

'''Sun Deng''' 孫登 (f. 230-260 CE) was a [[Daoist]] sage-recluse, a [[zitherist]], and allegedly the last master of [[transcendental whistling]]. [[Chinese literature]] has various anecdotes about Sun Deng refusing to teach the musicians [[Ji Kang]] (223-262) and [[Ruan Ji]] (210-263), two of the iconoclastic [[Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove]].

The moral of the story about Ruan Ji visiting Sun Deng, who preferred supernatural whistling over traditional master-disciple dialog, is the [[ineffability]] of the Dao (as explained in the opening of the ''[[Daodejing]]''). The [[Chinese poetry]] of the [[Six Dynasties]] and [[Tang dynasty]] developed this narrative into the "absent recluse" genre, expressing the unfulfilled desire to obtain wisdom by entering into conversation with a sage-recluse dwelling in the mountains (Varsano 1999: 56).

==Ji Kang stories==
[[File:Xikang.jpg|thumb|Ji/Xi Kang playing the ''[[guqin|qin]]'' zither]]
Ji Kang or Xi Kang (223-262) was a prominent intellectual of the [[Cao Wei]] (220-265) period, Daoist philosopher, author, poet, and musician. He was leader of the Seven Worthies/Sages of the Bamboo Grove, a group of intellectuals and artists who met occasionally at his estate to drink [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|wines]], take drugs, play music, and engage in witty ''[[qingtan]]'' "pure conversation".

Ji Kang's polymathic interests ranged from ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' "transcendence; immortality" techniques to [[music theory]]. His essay ''Yangsheng lun'' "On Nourishing Life" contends that one can achieve longevity through Daoist breathing exercises, diets (e.g., ''[[Bigu (avoiding grains)|bigu]]''), and drugs ([[Cold-Food Powder]]). Drug use was widespread among the literati in early medieval China, and Ji Kang was "reputed to have been a connoisseur in this field" (Chan 2014). Ji's writings on music include the famous ''Qin fu'' "A Rhapsody on the [[Guqin|Qin]]" zither, ''Shengwu aile lun'' "Essay on the Absence of Sorrow or Joy in Music", and a number of solo pieces for ''qin''.

The classical Chinese stringed instrument ''qin'' 琴 "zither; [sometimes translated] lute" is called ''[[guqin]]'' 古琴 "old zither" in [[Modern Standard Chinese]], owing to the common use of ''qin'' in names for instrumental loanwords (such as ''kouqin'' 口琴 "mouth organ; harmonica"). Sun Deng was renowned for playing a one-string version of the qin (一弦琴); the 499 ''[[Zhen'gao]]'' 真誥 (tr. Campany 2002: 516) says Sun Deng could "derive eight notes by plucking a single string."

Ji/Xi Kang and Ruan Ji were close friends, famous for their skills in poetry, music, and ''qingtan'' ripostes. They helped to develop ''[[xuanxue]]'' "Neo-Daoism" and emphasized the importance of ''[[ziran]]'' "naturalness; spontaneity". Ji and Ruan were in a [[LGBT history in China#Ancient China|homosexual]] relationship with [[Shan Tao (Taoist)|Shan Tao]], another one of the Seven Worthies, who described their friendship as "stronger than metal and fragrant as orchids" (tr. Hinsch 1990: 69). Ji Kang and Ruan Ji were such close friends that ''Jiruan'' 嵇阮 was a popular [[portmanteau]] for the pair. Ji and Ruan both tried unsuccessfully to study zither and transcendental whistling with Sun Deng.

===Shenxian zhuan===
[[Ge Hong]]'s (4th century) Daoist ''[[Shenxian zhuan]]'' "Biographies of Divine Transcendents" hagiography of Sun Deng 孙登 has the earliest version of the story about his refusal to teach Ji Kang about zither playing.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sun Deng's origin is not known. He stayed in the mountains, sitting in caves, strumming the zither and studying the ''Changes''. Winter or summer he wore only a single-layer garment, but when the weather grew extremely cold, someone observed him loosen his hair and use it to cover his body. It was over ten feet in length. When the Grand Mentor Yang Jun 楊駿 sent a messenger to invite Sun Deng to converse with him, Sun made no reply. Yang Jun then sent him a lined cloth robe as a gift. Upon its delivery, Sun came out from his gate, borrowed someone's knife, and cut the robe in two; he then placed the upper and lower halves in separate places outside Yang's gate. He also made a loud sound as if he were being cut in two. At the time, people thought him mad. Only later did they realize that Yang would be executed that way and that Sun was doing this as a symbolic prediction. Yang had him arrested and would not release him, so Sun died. Yang furnished a coffin and had him buried near Zhen Bridge. Several days later someone spotted him at Dongma Hill, so this person sent a letter to a friend of his in Luoxia. Ji Shuye [i.e., Ji Kang], who had ambitions to outstrip his era, once visited Sun Deng. Sun would not speak with him. When Ji raised objections, Sun calmly strummed his zither, until, after a long time, Ji finally stepped back. Sun then said, "Young man, you have excellent talent, but you lack knowledge of how to preserve the body. How will you avoid [harm]?" (It was not long after this that Ji was destroyed by implication in a grave affair.) Now Ji was skilled at playing the zither. At this point, Sun, using only one string, played a whole tune, and Ji, hearing it, sighed and became lost in thought. (tr. Campany 2002: 336) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Yang Jun (minister)|Yang Jun]] (d. 291) was a [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)]] official during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Emperor Wu]] and [[regent]] for [[Emperor Hui of Jin|Emperor Hui]]. Sun Deng's "death" and reappearance is typical for Daoist ''[[Shijie (Daoism)|shijie]]'' 尸解 "release from corpse" fake burial, the lowest level of ''xian'' "transcendence". This "grave affair" refers to Ji Kang getting involved in [[Cao Wei]] court politics, and sentenced to death by regent [[Sima Zhao]] for testifying to help a friend.

===Shishuo xinyu===
The ''[[Shishuo Xinyu]]'' "A New Account of Tales of the World" (tr. Mather 1976: 332) says, "While Hsi K'ang was wandering among the mountains of Chi Commandery (Honan), he met the Taoist adept [道士], Sun Teng, and thereafter continued his wanderings in his company. As K'ang was on the eve of departing, Teng said, 'As far as your ability is concerned, it's high enough, but your way of preserving your own life is inadequate'."

The ''Shishuo xinyu'' commentary by the [[Liang dynasty]] scholar Liu Xiaobiao 劉孝標 or Liu Jun劉峻 (462-521) quotes four texts. First, the anonymous ''Xi Kang Jishu'' 嵇康集序 (tr. Mather 1976: 333) says, "In the summer Sun Teng wove garments out of grass, and in the winter he covered himself with his unbound hair. He was fond of reading the "Book of Changes" and playing a one-stringed zither. All who saw him were attracted and delighted by him." Second, the ''Wei Shi Chunqiu'' 魏氏春秋 "Chronicles of the Clans of Wei", by [[Sun Sheng (Jin dynasty)|Sun Sheng]] (ca. 302-373), says (tr. Mather 1976: 333), "Sun Teng was by nature free of both joy and anger. If anyone doused him under water and then brought him out to look at him, Teng would just laugh aloud. Whatever items of clothing or food were provided him by households where he stayed he would never decline, but when he left he would leave them behind." Third, the (4th century) ''Wenshi zhuan'' 文士傳 "Biographies of Scholars" (tr. Mather 1976: 333), by Zhang Yin 張隱, gives this version of the story. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;During the Chia-p'ing era (249-253) some people of Chi Prefecture had gone into the mountains, where they saw a man. The place where he lived was an overhanging cliff rising a hundred ''jen'' (about 700 feet), where dense woods grew in shady luxuriance, yet his spirit and intelligence were extremely bright. He said of himself that his surname was Sun and his name, Teng, with the courtesy name, Kung-ho. When he heard of him, Hsi K'ang followed him about for three years. K'ang asked for his prognosis concerning his own future, but Teng never answered. However, K'ang always sighed in respectful admiration over the fine subtlety contained in his godlike counsels. When K'ang was about to take his leave, he said to the man, "Sir, have you nothing, after all, to say?" Teng finally answered, "Do you know anything about fire? When it is lit it gives light. Yet knowing when not to use the light is, after all, included in knowing when to use it. When a man is born he is endowed with ability. Yet knowing when not to use his ability is, after all, included in knowing when to use it. Thus, knowing when to use light is included in getting enough fuel to keep it burning, and knowing when to use ability is included in understanding things well enough to complete one's allotted years. Now your ability is abundant, but your understanding slight. You'll have difficulty avoiding trouble in today's world. Don't ask me anything more." K'ang was unable to use his advice, and when he became involved in the Lü An affair and was cast into prison, he composed a poem reproaching himself, as follows: "In the past I used to blush before Liu-hsia Hui, But now I am ashamed before Sun Teng." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Liu-hsia Hui or Liuxia Hui is the loyal politician [[Zhan Huo]] (720-621 BCE).
Fourth, Wang Yin's 王隱 (4th century) ''Jinshu'' (tr. Mather 1976: 333) explains, "Sun Teng was the one interviewed by Juan Chi. Hsi K'ang treated him as his teacher, with all the ceremony expected of a disciple. During the transition between Wei and Chin (ca. 260-265) it was easy to fall prey to jealousy and suspicion; both noble and base were engulfed together. For this reason Sun Teng was silent on some points."

=== Zengxiang liexian zhuan===
The [[Yuan dynasty]] (c. 14th century) ''Zengxiang liexian zhuan'' 增像列仙傳 "Enlarged and Illustrated Collected Biographies of Transcendents" elaborates on Ji/Xi Kang meeting Sun Deng, and mentions transcendental whistling in addition to zither playing.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sun Teng dwelt in a cave on the North Mountain in the prefecture of Chi [in Honan]. In summer, he made himself garments of plaited straw; in winter he covered himself only with his long hair. He was an expert in the art of whistling without a break, and he loved to read the Canon of Changes and to thrum a one-stringed lute. By temperament he was prone neither to joy nor to anger. Once, we are told, in the hope of seeing him angry, a man pitched him into the river, but when Sun Teng had scrambled out, he only burst into fits of laughter. The high-born statesman Hsi K'ang accompanied him in his wanderings for three years, yet whenever he questioned his Master about his aims, he could get no reply. When about to leave him, Hsi K'ang said: "After all this time, Sir, have you no word for me?" Sun Teng replied: "You know what fire is, don't you? It has the natural property of giving light, but not of using that light; yet its importance depends on the use made of its light. In man, intellectual capacity is a natural gift, but not the use made of that capacity; yet his worth depends on the use he makes of it. The use of light is contingent on a supply of fuel wherewith to preserve its radiance; and the use of intellect consists in acquiring a knowledge of Pure Truth so as to keep one's life immune from harm." Hsi K'ang also asked for instruction in playing the lute, but Sun Teng would not teach him. "Your intellectual capacity is great," he said, "but your knowledge is small. It will be difficult for you to pass unscathed through the world of to-day." … In the end, Sun Teng rose up to heaven in broad daylight (tr. Giles 1948: 94-95) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Ruan Ji stories==
[[File:Ruan Ji or scholar. Sun Wei. ShanghaiMuseum.jpg|thumb|Ruan Ji, (c. 9th century) [[Tang dynasty]] portrait]]
[[Ruan Ji]] (210-263) was a skillful poet, essayist, and musician, who rebelled against orthodox Confucian rituals and conventions. He loved drinking wine, and his ''Jinshu'' biography says he avoided an arranged marriage into the [[Sima (Chinese surname)|Sima]] family by staying drunk for 60 days. The famous ''guqin''-zither melody, ''Jiukuang'' "Drunken Ecstasy" is attributed to him.

Ruan wrote philosophical essays about the ''[[Yijing]]'', ''[[Daodejing]]'', and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', his masterful  ''Yonghuai shi'' "Songs of My Soul", and ''Yue lun'' "Disquisition on Music". Among recluse poets who practiced transcendental whistling as a way to absorb themselves into nature, Ruan Ji was the most famous whistler of the Jin dynasty (Su 2006: 32). After meeting Sun Deng, Ruan Ji immortalized him in ''Daren xiansheng zhuan'' "Biography of Master Great Man", which praises Daoist transcendence over the mundane world.

===Shishuo xinyu===
In the (5th century) ''Shishuo xinyu'' version of this transcendental whistling story about Ruan Ji, Sun Deng is referred to as the ''[[zhenren]]'' "perfected person" in the Sumen Mountains 蘇門山.
&lt;blockquote&gt;When Juan Chi whistled [嘯], he could be heard several hundred paces away. In the Su-men Mountains (Honan) there appeared from nowhere a Realized Man [真人] about whom the woodcutters were all relaying tales. Juan Chi went to see for himself and spied the man squatting with clasped knees by the edge of a cliff. Chi climbed the ridge to approach him and then squatted opposite him. Chi rehearsed for him briefly matters from antiquity to the present, beginning with an exposition of the Way of Mystical Quiescence [玄寂] of the Yellow Emperor and Shen Nung, and ending with an investigation of the excellence of the Supreme Virtue [盛德] of the Three Ages (Hsia, Shang, and Chou). But when Chi asked his opinion about it he remained aloof and made no reply. Chi then went on to expound that which lies beyond Activism [有為之教], and the techniques of Resting the Spirit [棲神] and Conducting the Vital Force [導氣]. But when Chi looked toward him for a reply, he was still exactly as before, fixedly staring without turning. Chi therefore turned toward him and made a long whistling sound [長嘯]. After a long while the man finally laughed and said, "Do it again." Chi whistled a second time [復嘯], but as his interest was now exhausted, he withdrew. He had returned about half-way down the ridge when he heard above him a shrillness like an orchestra of many instruments, while forests and valleys reechoed with the sound. Turning back to look, he discovered it was the whistling of the man he had just visited [向人嘯]. (49, tr. Mather 1976: 331) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Donald Holzman (2009: 154) comments on their meeting: "It (''xiao'') was an unintellectual art, probably a fairly strange kind of sound that is divorced from speech and reason....When Ruan Ji whistles Sun Teng sees that he is not merely a pedant, but also an adept of an art that imitates nature, that he is able to control his breath so as to make it resemble that very breath of heaven."

The ''Shishuo xinyu'' commentary by Liu Xiaobiao quotes two texts. First, the (4th century) ''Wei Shi Chunqiu'' 魏氏春秋 version says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Juan Chi often went riding alone wherever his fancy led him, not following the roads or byways, to the point where carriage tracks would go no farther, and always he would return weeping bitterly. Once while he was wandering in the Su-men Mountains there was a recluse living there whose name no one knew, and whose only possessions were a few ''hu''-measures of bamboo fruit, a mortar and pestle, and nothing more. When Juan Chi heard of him he went to see him and began conversing on the Way of Non-action [無為] of high antiquity, and went on to discuss the moral principles [義] of the Five Emperors and Three August Ones. The Master of Su-men remained oblivious and never even looked his way. Chi then with a shrill sound made a long whistling whose echoes reverberated through the empty stillness. The Master of Su-men finally looked pleased and laughed. After Chi bad gone down the hill, the Master gathered his breath and whistled shrilly with a sound like that of the phoenix. Chi had all his life been a connoisseur of music, and he borrowed the theme of his discussion with the Master of Su-men to express what was in his heart in a song, the words of which are: "The sun sets west of Mt. Pu-chou; The moon comes up from Cinnabar Pool. Essence of Yang is darkened and unseen; While Yin rays take their turn to win. His brilliance lasts but for a moment; her dark will soon again be full. If wealth and honor stay but for a trice must poverty and low estate be evermore?" (tr. Mather 1976: 331-332) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Second, the ''Zhulin Qixian Lun'' 竹林七賢論 (tr. Mather 1976: 332), by Dai Kui 戴逵 (d. 396) explains, "After Juan Chi returned (from the Su-men Mountains) he proceeded to compose the "Discourse on Mr. Great Man" [大人先生論]. What was said in this discourse all represented the basic feelings in his breast and heart. The main point was that Mr. Great Man was none other than Juan himself."

===Jin shu===
The (648) ''[[Book of Jin]]'' ([[:s:zh:晉書/卷049|49]]) biography of Ruan Ji uses ''changxiao'' and ''xiao'' to describe his meeting with Sun Deng.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Once [Juan] Chi met Sun Teng on Su-men Mountain. [Juan Chi] touched on topics of ancient times, and on the arts of "posing the spirit" and "leading the breath." [Sun] Teng kept silent throughout. As a result, [Juan] Chi expelled a long whistle [籍因長嘯而退], and took his leave. When he had descended halfway down the mountain, he heard a sound like the cry of the phoenix resounding throughout the peaks and valleys. It was the whistling of [Sun] Teng [乃登之嘯也]. (tr. Varsano 1999: 56)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Varsano (1999: 57) explains transcendental whistling as a direct representation of the ineffable Dao, "his superhuman whistle, a primordial sound that does not describe the secrets of the universe, but incarnates it."

The context goes on to say that after Sun Deng refused to talk with Ruan Ji, Xi Kang followed Sun Deng travelling for three years. Since [[Sima Zhao]] became generalissimo in 255, Holzman dates Ruan Ji's visit around 257, and Xi Kang's around 258 to 260. Based on the different mountain names, Chan (1996: 151, 158) says Ruan Ji visited Sun Deng twice, first around 226-230, and then around 255-263; and dates Xi Kang's travels at around 249-251.

===Xiaozhi===
The anonymous (c. 8th century) ''Xiaozhi'' 嘯旨 "Principles of Whistling" mentions Sun Deng and Ruan Ji—honorifically called Sun Gong 孫公 "Master Sung" and Ruan Sizong 阮嗣宗 (his [[courtesy name]])—as the last transcendental whistlers, and describes whistling tunes attributed to them, "Sumen Mountains" retells the story of Ruan's visit to Sun, and "Loose Rhymes of Ruan" is an easy-whistling melody.

The ''Xiaozhi'' Preface gives a transmission history of ''xiao''-whistling that goes from mythological sages to the historical whistlers of Sun Deng and Ruan Ji (adapted from Edwards 1957: 219-220). [[Laozi]] transmitted the technique to [[Queen Mother of the West]], up through [[Emperor Shun]], who transmitted whistling to [[Yu the Great]], "after whom the art declined. It revived with the Immortal of the Jin dynasty Sun Gong of [[Taihang Mountains]]. Sun found the Way (adopted the Daoist rule of life) and disappeared. Ruan Sizong had a smattering of the art but after him it was quite lost, and whistling was no longer heard."

Two ''Xiaozhi'' sections describe whistling tunes attributed to Sun Deng and Ruan Ji, "Sumen Mountain" (11) and "The Loose Rhymes of Ruan" (13). "Sumen [Mountain]" 蘇門 retells the story of Ruan Ji visiting Sun Deng, referred to as the Daoist master living on Sumen, like the ''Shishuo xinyu'' above.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The 'Su Men' was composed by the Taoist Immortal Recluse, who lived in the Su Men Mountains (of Honan). The Holy One transmitted, he did not make it. The Immortal transmitted (the music of) [[Guangchengzi|Kuang Ch'eng]] and Wu Kuang 務光 in order to rejoice the spirit and expand the Tao. He did not regard music as the main task. In olden days there were those who roved in Su Men listening to the phoenix' songs. The notes were exquisitely clear, very different from the so-called pretended phoenix. The phoenix makes sounds but humans cannot hear them. How then can the Su Family know the sound of the phoenix? Hereafter, when seeking the sound, bring up the Immortal's whistle. The Immortal's whistle does not stop at fostering the Tao and gratifying the spirits; for indeed, in everyday affairs it brings harmony into the world, and peace in season. In oneself the Tao never dies, in objective matters it assists all that is sacred, and conducts the Five Influences. In the arcana of Nature order prevails. For success in obtaining response (to such efforts) nothing approaches music. The Immortal has evolved the one successful form. As to all wild things whistling is the one thing needful. Yuan Szu-tsung of Chin (Yuan Chi) was a fine whistler. Hearing that the Immortal thought himself his equal, he (Yuan) went to visit him. The Immortal remained seated with his hair in disorder. Yuan bowed repeatedly and inquired after his health. Thrice and again thrice he addressed his (uncivil) host. The Immortal maintained his attitude and made no response. Chi then whistled some score of notes and left. The Immortal, estimating that his guest had not gone far, began to whistle the Ch'ing Chueh [清角] to the extent of four or five movements. But Chi perceived that the mountains and all growing things took on a different sound. Presently came a fierce whirlwind with pelting rain, followed by phoenixes and peacocks in flocks; no one could count them. Chi was alarmed, but also pleased, and he returned home and wrote down the story. He obtained only two-tenths of it, and called it 'Su Men'. This is what they tell there. The motif of the song is lofty mountains and wide marshes, great heights and distances. (tr. Edwards 1957: 226) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The "Loose Rhymes of Ruan" section says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The 'Loose Rhymes of the Yuan' were really composed by Yuan Chi. The rhymes are free and easy; hence the title. … Both persons of refinement and culture and commonplace and mean folk can listen with appreciation. The majesty of the heavenly principle, purged from all miasmic influence, may mingle with the ordinary music of the Hsuan and the Ch'ih, and the music of Cheng and Yueh enter the ear. Most good whistlers can perform this air. Whenever persons retired in the woods and by springs puff out wind and by accident produce a rhymed sound, if their attempt misses success, it is simply a misfire; if it is completely successful then it remains. The above gives a general idea of the 'Loose Rhymes of the Yuan'. (tr. Edwards 1957: 227) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
These ancient instruments are the ''[[Xun (instrument)|xun]]'' 塤 "a globular [[ocarina]]" and ''[[List of Chinese musical instruments#Flutes|chi]]'' 篪 "a transverse bamboo flute", and these [[Zhou dynasty]] states were [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]] and [[Yue (state)|Yue]].

The "Standard Notes" section (14, tr. Edwards 1957: 227) mentions Sun Deng and Daoist immortality, "In comparatively modern days, Sun Kung was successful, but people did not listen. As to peaceful notes [平和], they stave off old age and do not allow one to die. These Standard notes are known about, but the notes themselves are lost."

The ''Xiaozhi'' "Conclusion" section (15, tr. Edwards 1957: 228) says, "The conclusion is at the extremities of the [pentatonic] scale, the end of the Great Tao. After the days of Yao and Shun there was some idea of these notes, but the actual notes were lost." It also dismisses the preface history with mythic whistlers like Queen Mother of the West and accepts the historicity of Sun Deng's and Ruan Ji's whistling.
&lt;blockquote&gt;is extravagant talk, and not usually accepted. But the twelve methods are found in Sun Teng and Yuan Chi, so that we can truly say we have the general purport of Whistling. The Preface also says that Sun Teng did not hand on (the gift) to anyone, and after Yuan Chi it disappeared and was no more heard. … Now the voice of man is the voice of the universe (nature). Man may be ancient or modern, but sound is eternal, never new or old. Now this book is going forth and who knows whether a Sun or Yuan may not appear in some mountains or woods and, that being so, who can say that there is an end to Whistling? (tr. Edwards 1957: 228) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hushao===
The preeminent Chinese [[avant-garde]] author [[Ge Fei (author)|Ge Fei]] wrote the (1995) ''Hūshào'' 忽哨 "Whistling" short story, which is a modern update on the story about Sun and Ruan. [[Victor Mair]], who translated "Whistling" into English, says
&lt;blockquote&gt;An old legend of the celebrated encounter between the two men has Ruan Ji visiting Sun Deng in his hermitage but not receiving any responses to his questions. Thereupon, he withdraws and, halfway up a distant mountain, lets out a loud, piercing whistle. This is followed by Sun Deng's magnificent whistled reply, which inspires Ruan Ji to write the "Biography of Master Great Man," an encomium in praise of the Taoist "true man" that also satirizes the conventional Confucian "gentleman". (1998:43) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ge Fei's "Whistling" tells how the young, famous poet Ruan Ji regularly came to visit the aged hermit Sun Deng on Su 
Gate Mountain 蘇門山 in present-day [[Henan]], and play games of ''weiqi'' "[[Go (game)|go]]". During one go game, Sun was silently pondering how to move a piece, and Ruan surprised him. "When the whistling sound suddenly arose, Sun Deng was totally unprepared for it. The strange, strident sound, mixed with the sounds of the billowing pines, reverberated through the valleys of Su Gate Mountain for a long while without expiring." (tr. Mair 1998:43).

After a final game of go, Ruan took his leave from Sun owing to the "prolonged and profound silence that made him feel bored." Sun watches Ruan's silhouette gradually dissolving into the dark green distance,
&lt;blockquote&gt;When the sound of whistling rose beneath the sunny empyrean, Sun Deng shuddered as though it were a bolt out of the blue. Shielding his eyes from the strong light with one hand, he saw Ruan Ji standing on the peak of Su Gate Mountain beneath a solitary tree. Against a backdrop of white clouds like thick cotton fleece, he stood motionless, seeing to wait for Sun Deng's answer. Sun Deng looked all around him, then quietly inserted his thumb and forefinger in his mouth—the extreme frailness of his body and the looseness of his teeth caused him to be unable to produce any sound. The shrill, desolate, plaintive whistle, accompanied by the soughing of the billowing pines, reverberated for a long time in the mountain valleys. It was like the sad wail of the poet who died long ago, penetrating through the barriers of time, continuing up till today, and sinking into the easily awakened dreams of a living person. (tr. Mair 1998: 68) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8915">The '''Ingersoll Lectures''' is a series of lectures presented annually at [[Harvard University]] on the subject of [[immortality]].

==Endowment==
''The Ingersoll Lectureship'' was established by a bequest by Caroline Haskell Ingersoll, who died in 1893, leaving $5000 for the institution of a series of lectures to be read annually in memory of her father, George Goldthwait Ingersoll. The lectures were to take place at [[Harvard University]] on the subject of "the immortality of man".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yDwmLJoAY8MC&amp;pg=RA1-PA4&amp;lpg=RA1-PA4&amp;dq=%22ingersoll+foundation%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=DB4Cqhf16R&amp;sig=9mMplaetPx46Za1thNSOsmxCNeU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA335,M1 see for instance]&lt;/ref&gt;
The lectures were initiated by Harvard president [[Charles W. Eliot]] in 1896. They are now generally known as ''The Ingersoll Lectures on Human Immortality''.

The lectures were to be published. From 1896 to 1912 they were issued by the [[Houghton Mifflin]] Company of Boston and New York. From 1914 to 1935 [[Harvard University Press]] published them. Since then, the lectures have been published in the [[Harvard Divinity School#Harvard Divinity Bulletin|Harvard Divinity Bulletin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1403">[[File:ParseTree.svg|thumb|150px|A parse tree, which generates "John hit the ball" when it is unparsed.]]

In [[computing]], an '''unparser''' is a system that constructs a set of characters or image components from a given [[parse tree]].&lt;ref name=Ikuo &gt;''Software Science and Engineering'' edited by Ikuo Nakata 1991 {{ISBN|981020776X}} page 168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ehrig /&gt;

An unparser is in effect the reverse of a traditional [[Parsing|parser]] that takes a set of string of characters and produces a parse tree. Unparsing generally involves the application of a specific set of rules to the parse tree as a "[[Tree traversal|tree walk]]" takes place.&lt;ref name=Ikuo /&gt;

Given that the tree may involve both textual and graphic elements, the unparser may have two separate modules, each of which handles the relevant components.&lt;ref name=Ehrig &gt;''Handbook of Graph Grammars and Computing by Graph Transformation: Applications, Languages and Tools'' by H. Ehrig, G. Engels 1999 {{ISBN|9810240201}} pages 231-232&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases the "master unparser" looks up the "master unparse table" to determine if a given nested structure should be handled by one module, or the other.&lt;ref name=Ehrig /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14441">'''William Kurtz Wimsatt Jr.''' (November 17, 1907 – December 17, 1975) was an American professor of English, literary theorist, and critic. Wimsatt is often associated with the concept of the [[intentional fallacy]], which he developed with [[Monroe Beardsley]] in order to discuss the importance of an author's intentions for the creation of a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;Wimsatt, William K. and Monroe C. Beardsley. "The Intentional Fallacy." Sewanee Review, vol. 54 (1946): 468-488. Revised and republished in The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry, U of Kentucky P, 1954: 3-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
Wimsatt was born in [[Washington D.C.]], attended [[Georgetown University]] and, later, [[Yale University]], where he received his [[Ph.D.]] In 1939, Wimsatt joined the English department at Yale, where he taught until his death in 1975. During his lifetime, Wimsatt became known for his studies of eighteenth-century literature (Leitch et al. 1372). He wrote many works of [[literary theory]] and [[criticism]] such as ''The Prose Style of Samuel Johnson'' (1941) and ''Philosophic Words: A Study of Style and Meaning in the "Rambler" and "Dictionary" of [[Samuel Johnson]]'' (1948; Leitch et al. 1372). His major works include ''The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry'' (1954); ''Hateful Contraries'' (1965) and ''Literary Criticism: A Short History'' (1957, with [[Cleanth Brooks]]). Wimsatt was considered crucial to [[New Criticism]] (particularly New [[Formalism (literature)|Formalist]] Criticism; 1372). He was a member of the [[Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

== Influences ==
Wimsatt was influenced by [[Monroe Beardsley]], with whom he wrote some of his most important pieces. Wimsatt also drew on the work of both ancient critics, such as [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] and [[Aristotle]], and some of his own contemporaries, such as [[T. S. Eliot]] and the writers of the [[Chicago school (literary criticism)|Chicago School]], to formulate his theories, often by highlighting key ideas in those authors' works in order to refute them.

== Influence ==

Wimsatt's ideas have affected the development of [[reader-response criticism]], and his influence has been noted in the works of writers such as [[Stanley Fish]], and in works such as [[Walter Benn Michaels]]' and [[Steven Knapp]]’s “Against Theory” (Leitch et al. 1373-1374).

== Approach ==

Wimsatt was interviewed, along with [[Walter J. Ong]], S.J., of [[Saint Louis University]], by Sheila Hough on the 327th edition of the radio talk-show Yale Reports, broadcast on May 24, 1964, by WTIC-Hartford. (Professor Wimsatt had received an honorary doctorate from [[Saint Louis University]] in 1963.) Ms. Hough asked Professor Wimsatt a question that still resonates today: "Is literature taught in complete isolation from its author, Mr. Wimsatt -- don't you consider the person who wrote it?"

Wimsatt replied: "I do, of course. Your question, I think, was prompted by that very fine essay of Father Ong's, 'The Jinnee in the Well-Wrought Urn,' which you read in his book ''The Barbarian Within'' [1962: 15-25]. It first appeared in ''Essays in Criticism'' at Oxford some years ago [1954], and was in part, I believe, an answer to an essay written many years ago, about twenty at least, by a friend of mine, [[Monroe Beardsley]], and myself, called 'The Intentional Fallacy.' I would like to pay Father Ong the compliment of saying that I think that his essay 'The Jinnee in the Well-Wrought Urn' is the only sensible response that has ever been written to that essay of ours."

As a staunch [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] critic, Wimsatt believed in the authority of the poem: any analysis of a poem must centre on the text itself (Leitch et al. 1371-1372). He outlines and advocates (particularly in his two influential essays written with [[Monroe Beardsley]], “[[intentional fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]” and “[[affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]”) an “objective criticism” in which the critic essentially disregards the intentions of the poet and the effect of the poem on the audience as the sole (or even the major) factors in analyzing and evaluating a poem (Davis and Schleifer 43).

Wimsatt does allow for a certain degree of variation in the analysis of poetry and does not necessarily contend that there is only one possible reading for any given poem. He allows, for example, for what he calls the “literary sense” of meaning, saying that “no two different words or different phrases ever mean fully the same” (Verbal Icon xii).

Much of his theory, however, appears to stem from an ambivalence towards "[[impressionism]], [[subjectivism]], and relativism” (Leitch et al. 1373) in criticism. In ''Hateful Contraries'', Wimsatt refers to a “New Amateurism,” an “anti-criticism” emerging in works such as [[Leslie Fiedler]]’s “Credo,” which appeared in the ''[[Kenyon Review]]''. “The only reservation the theorist need have about such critical impressionism or expressionism,” says Wimsatt, “is that, after all, it does not carry on very far in our cogitation about the nature and value of literature…it is not a very mature form of cognitive discourse” (''Hateful Contraries'' xvi).

Indeed, Wimsatt is concerned with ensuring a level of legitimacy in English studies and he sets about doing so by favouring a scientific approach to criticism—even, for example, decrying affective theory as “less a scientific view of literature than a prerogative -- that of a soul adventuring among masterpieces” (''Verbal Icon'' 29).

== Theories ==

Wimsatt contributed several theories to the critical landscape, particularly through his major work, ''The Verbal Icon'' (of which some of the ideas are discussed below). His ideas generally centre around the same questions tackled by many critics: what is poetry and how does one evaluate it?

=== Intentional fallacy ===
{{main|Intentional fallacy}}

Perhaps Wimsatt’s most influential theories come from the essays “The Intentional Fallacy” and “The Affective Fallacy” (both are published in ''Verbal Icon'') which he wrote with [[Monroe Beardsley]]. Each of these texts “codifies a crucial tenet of New Critical formalist orthodoxy,” making them both very important to twentieth-century criticism (Leitch et al. 1371).

The [[Intentional Fallacy]], according to Wimsatt, derives from “confusion between the poem and its origins” (''Verbal Icon'' 21) – essentially, it occurs when a critic puts too much emphasis on personal, biographical, or what he calls “external” information when analyzing a work (they note that this is essentially the same as the “[[Genetic fallacy]]” in philosophical studies; 21). Wimsatt and Beardsley consider this strategy a fallacy partly because it is impossible to determine the intention of the author — indeed, authors themselves are often unable to determine the “intention” of a poem — and partly because a poem, as an act that takes place between a poet and an audience, has an existence outside of both and thus its meaning can not be evaluated simply based on the intentions of or the effect on either the writer or the audience(see the section of this article entitled “The Affective Fallacy" for a discussion of the latter; 5). For Wimsatt and Beardsley, intentional criticism becomes subjective criticism, and so ceases to be criticism at all. For them, critical inquiries are resolved through evidence in and of the text — not “by consulting the oracle” (18).

=== Affective fallacy ===
{{main|Affective fallacy}}

The Affective fallacy (identified in the essay of the same name, which Wimsatt co-authored with [[Monroe Beardsley]], as above) refers to “confusion between the poem and its ''results''” (''Verbal Icon 21''; italics in original). It refers to the error of placing too much emphasis on the effect that a poem has on its audience when analyzing it.

Wimsatt and [[Monroe Beardsley|Beardsley]] argue that the effect of poetic language alone is an unreliable way to analyze poetry because, they contend, words have no effect in and of themselves, independent of their meaning. It is impossible, then, for a poem to be “pure emotion” (38), which means that a poem’s meaning is not “equivalent to its effects, especially its emotional impact, on the reader” (Leitch et al. 1371).

As with the Intentional fallacy, engaging in affective criticism is too subjective an exercise to really warrant the label “criticism” at all — thus, for Wimsatt and [[Monroe Beardsley|Beardsley]], it is a fallacy of analysis.

=== Concrete Universal ===

In “The Concrete Universal,” Wimsatt attempts to determine how specific or general (i.e., concrete or universal) a verbal representation must be in order to achieve a particular effect. What is the difference, for example, between referring to a “purple cow” and a “tan cow with a broken horn” (''Verbal Icon'' 74)? In addressing such questions, Wimsatt attempts to resolve what it is that makes [[poetry]] different from other forms of communication, concluding that “what distinguishes poetry from scientific or logical discourse is a degree of concreteness which does not contribute anything to the argument but is somehow enjoyable or valuable for its own sake.” For Wimsatt, poetry is “the vehicle of a metaphor which one boards heedless of where it runs, whether cross-town or downtown — just for the ride” (76).

=== The Domain of Criticism ===

In “The Domain of Criticism,” Wimsatt “[defends] the domain of poetry and poetics from the encircling (if friendly) arm of the general [[aesthetics|aesthetician]]" (''Verbal Icon'' 221) – that is, he discusses the problems with discussing poetry in purely [[aesthetic]] terms. Wimsatt questions the ability of a poem to function aesthetically in the same way as a [[painting]] or [[sculpture]]. For one, visual modes such as sculpture or painting are undertaken using materials that directly correlate with the object they represent — at least in terms of their “beauty.” A beautiful painting of an apple, for example, is done with beautiful paint.

Verbal expression, however, does not function this way — as Wimsatt points out, there is no such thing as a “beautiful” or “ugly” word (or, at least, there is no general consensus as to how to apply such concepts in such a context; 228). There is no correlation between words and their subject, at least in terms of [[aesthetics]] — “the example of the dunghill (or equivalent object) beautifully described is one of the oldest in literary discussion” (228).

More importantly, language does not function merely on the level of its effects on the senses, as (for example) visual modes do. A poem does not just derive its meaning from its [[rhyme]] and meter, but these are the domains of [[aesthetics]] (231) — to analyse [[poetry]] on the basis of its [[aesthetics]], then, is insufficient in one is to adequately explore its meaning.

== Major works ==

=== ''The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry'' ===

Written as a series of independent essays between 1941 and 1952, ''The Verbal Icon'' was finally published as a cohesive work (after Wimsatt revised some of the original versions) in 1954. Probably his most influential work, ''The Verbal Icon'' contains two of Wimsatt's most important essays, “The Intentional Fallacy” and “The Affective Fallacy” (co-authored with [[Monroe Beardsley]]). Paul de Man offers a significant critique of Wimsatt's text, taken as an example of the understanding of the notion of 'autonomy' in New Criticism, in ''Blindness and Insight''.

=== ''Hateful Contraries: Studies in Literature and Criticism'' ===

Apparently concerned with the (admittedly lessened) influence of what he calls “Amateur Criticism,” Wimsatt published ''Hateful Contraries'' in 1965 as a way to “distinguish what [he] consider[s] an inevitable and proper literary interest in the contraries” (Hateful Contraries xviii). Through studies of works by T. S. Eliot as well as discussions of topics such as “The Augustan Mode in English Poetry” and “The Criticism of Comedy” (xi), Wimsatt attempts to add to the efforts to justify and improve [[literary criticism]] (xix).

=== ''Literary Criticism: A Short History'' ===

Written with [[Cleanth Brooks]] in 1957, ''Literary Criticism: A Short History'' is intended as “a history of ideas about verbal art and about its elucidation and criticism” (Wimsatt and Brooks ix). The authors attempt to contribute to the “intelligibility in the history of literary argument” as well as “contributes to a distinct point of view,” which, they argue, is a necessary part of any historical literary studies (vii).

'''Yuval Noah Harari''' ({{he|יובל נח הררי}}; born 24 February 1976) is an Israeli historian and a tenured professor in the Department of History at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynharari.com/ Yuval Harari site], at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] site&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of the international bestsellers ''[[Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind]]'' (2014), ''[[Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow]]'' (2016), and ''[[21 Lessons for the 21st Century]]'' (2018). His writings examine [[free will]], [[consciousness]] and [[intelligence]].

Harari's early publications are concerned with what he describes as the "[[Behavioral modernity|cognitive revolution]]" occurring roughly 50,000 years ago, when [[Homo sapiens]] supplanted the rival [[Neanderthals]], developed language skills and structured societies, and ascended as [[apex predator]]s, aided by the [[First Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] and more recently accelerated by [[Scientific revolution|scientific]] methodology and rationale which have allowed humans to approach near mastery over their environment.

His recent books are more cautionary, and work through the consequences of a futuristic [[Biotechnology|biotechnological]] world where intelligent biological organisms are surpassed by their own creations; he has said "Homo sapiens as we know them will disappear in a century or so".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/mar/19/yuval-harari-sapiens-readers-questions-lucy-prebble-arianna-huffington-future-of-humanity|title=Yuval Noah Harari: ‘Homo sapiens as we know them will disappear in a century or so’ |authors= [[Andrew Anthony]], [[Lucy Prebble]], [[Arianna Huffington]], [[Esther Rantzen]] and a selection of our readers |date=19 March 2017|work=[[The Observer]]|access-date=17 March 2018 |language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Harari first specialized in [[medieval history]] and [[military history]] in his studies from 1993 to 1998 at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] (doctorate) degree at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], in 2002 under the supervision of Steven J. Gunn. From 2003 to 2005 he pursued postdoctoral studies in history as a [[Yad Hanadiv]] Fellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~ynharari/cv.html|title = CV at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem|date = 2008|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has published numerous books and articles, including ''Special Operations in the Age of Chivalry, 1100–1550'';&lt;ref&gt;Yuval Noah Harari, ''Special Operations in the Age of Chivalry, 1100–1550'' (Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Ultimate Experience: Battlefield Revelations and the Making of Modern War Culture, 1450–2000'';&lt;ref&gt;Yuval Noah Harari, ''The Ultimate Experience: Battlefield Revelations and the Making of Modern War Culture, 1450–2000'' (Houndmills: Palgrave-Macmillan, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Concept of 'Decisive Battles' in World History'';&lt;ref&gt;Yuval Noah Harari, ''The Concept of 'Decisive Battles' in World History'', in ''[[Journal of World History]]'' 18:3 (2007), 251–266.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Armchairs, Coffee and Authority: Eye-witnesses and Flesh-witnesses Speak about War, 1100–2000''.&lt;ref&gt;Yuval Noah Harari, "Armchairs, Coffee and Authority: Eye-witnesses and Flesh-witnesses Speak about War, 1100–2000", ''[[The Journal of Military History]]'' 74:1 (January 2010), pp. 53–78.&lt;/ref&gt; He now specializes in [[world history]] and [[macro-historical]] processes.

His book ''[[Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind]]'' was published in Hebrew in 2011 and then in English in 2014; it has since been translated into some 30 additional languages.&lt;ref name="Telegraph_Payne"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Payne|first1=Tom|title=Sapiens: a Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari, review: 'urgent questions'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/11120947/Sapiens-a-Brief-History-of-Humankind-by-Yuval-Noah-Harari-review-urgent-questions.html|accessdate=29 October 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book surveys the entire length of [[human history]], from the evolution of [[Homo sapiens]] in the Stone Age up to the political and technological revolutions of the 21st century. The [[Hebrew]] edition became a bestseller in Israel, and generated much interest both in the academic community and among the general public, turning Harari into a celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/fast-talk-the-road-to-happiness-1.426554 Fast talk / The road to happiness], in ''[[Haaretz]]'', 25 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
YouTube video clips of Harari's Hebrew lectures on the history of the world have been viewed by tens of thousands of Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiJasqDJRow "A Brief History of Mankind course], in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem channel in YouTube (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Harari also gives a free online course in English titled ''A Brief History of Humankind''.

His book ''[[Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow]]'' was published in 2016, examining possibilities of the future of ''Homo sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/24/homo-deus-by-yuval-noah-harari-review|title=Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari review – how data will destroy human freedom|last=Runciman|first=David|date=24 August 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 October 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's premise outlines that in the future, humanity is likely to make a significant attempt to gain [[happiness]], [[immortality]] and [[God]]-like powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953597984|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=2016|publisher=Vintage|year=|isbn=9781784703936|location=London|pages=75|oclc=953597984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book goes on to openly speculate various ways this ambition might be realised for ''Homo sapiens'' in the future based on the past and present. Among several possibilities for the future, Harari develops a term for a philosophy or mindset that worships [[Dataism|big data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953597984|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=2017|publisher=Vintage|year=|isbn=9781784703936|location=London|pages=429|oclc=953597984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/50bb4830-6a4c-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c|title=Yuval Noah Harari on big data, Google and the end of free will|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=26 August 2016|website=Financial Times|access-date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harari's most recent book is called ''[[21 Lessons for the 21st Century]]'' and focuses more on present-day concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/15/21-lessons-for-the-21st-century-by-yuval-noah-harari-review|title=21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari review – a guru for our times?|last=Lewis|first=Helen|date=15 August 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/review-21-lessons-for-the-21st-century-by-yuval-noah-harari-chilling-predictions-from-the-author-of-sapiens-f3n30fn6q|title=Review: 21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari — chilling predictions from the author of Sapiens|last=Russell|first=Review by Jenni|date=19 August 2018|access-date=25 August 2018|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/books/21-lessons-for-the-21st-century-by-yuval-noah-harari-review-a3918696.html|title=Can mindfulness save us from the menace of artificial intelligence?|work=Evening Standard|access-date=25 August 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published on 30 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/08/yuval-noah-harari-s-21-lessons-21st-century-banal-and-risible-self-help-book|title=Yuval Noah Harari’s 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is a banal and risible self-help book|last=|first=|date=|website=New Statesman|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/book-review-is-21-lessons-for-the-21st-century-another-hit-for-yuval-noah-harari-1.763381|title=Book review: Is '21 Lessons for the 21st Century' another hit for Yuval Noah Harari|work=The National|access-date=25 August 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter Two he addresses the increasing number of people made unemployable by advances in automation and AI.  As an alternative to food stamps, welfare, etc. he proposes a Universal Basic Income for every citizen regardless of their employment status.

==Views and opinions==
Harari is interested in how ''Homo sapiens'' reached their current condition, and in their future. His research focuses on macro-historical questions such as: What is the relation between history and biology? What is the essential difference between ''Homo sapiens'' and other animals? Is there justice in history? Does history have a direction? Did people become happier as history unfolded?

Harari regards dissatisfaction as the "deep root" of human reality, and as related to evolution.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/fast-talk-the-road-to-happiness-1.426554|title=Fast Talk The Road to Happiness|date=25 April 2017|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 article Harari has argued that through continuing technological progress and advances in the field of [[artificial intelligence]], "by 2050 a new class of people might emerge – the useless class. People who are not just unemployed, but unemployable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/08/virtual-reality-religion-robots-sapiens-book|title=The meaning of life in a world without work|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=8 May 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=10 May 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; He put forward the case that dealing with this new social class economically, socially and politically will be a central challenge for humanity in the coming decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=iqsquared|title=Yuval Noah Harari on the Rise of Homo Deus|date=15 September 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ1yS9JIJKs|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harari has commented on the [[animal welfare|plight of animals]], particularly domesticated animals since the agricultural revolution, and is a [[vegan]].&lt;ref name="guardian0705"/&gt; In a 2015 ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article under the title "Industrial farming is one of the worst crimes in history" he called "[t]he fate of industrially farmed animals (...) one of the most pressing ethical questions of our time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/25/industrial-farming-one-worst-crimes-history-ethical-question|title=Industrial farming is one of the worst crimes in history|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=25 September 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=5 April 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
Harari twice won the [[Polonsky Academy for Advanced Studies|Polonsky Prize]] for "Creativity and Originality", in 2009 and 2012. In 2011 he won the [[Society for Military History]]'s Moncado Award for outstanding articles in military history. In 2012 he was elected to the Young Israeli Academy of Sciences.
