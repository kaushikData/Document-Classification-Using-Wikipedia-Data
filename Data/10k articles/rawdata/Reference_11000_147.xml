      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9021">An '''age55 -restricted community''' is a [[residential community]], often [[gated community|gated]], that typically limits 80% of the residency to individuals who are over a set age. The minimum age is frequently set at 55 years old, but it can vary.

These communities are set up to accommodate older individuals who would like to live in an area without the perceived problems of having children around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/10476754.stm|title= The quiet life in a child-free village|work= BBC News|location=Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Second Home Buying: Glossary of Terms | date=October 2010 | publisher= | url =http://www.privatecommunities.com/second-home-buying/glossary/community-planning-and-development-terms.htm#9 | work =PrivateCommunities.com | pages = | accessdate = 2011-11-04 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases a younger spouse or significant other is permitted to live in the community as long as one member meets the minimum age requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Age Restricted Communities | date=July 2008 | publisher= | url =http://www.topretirements.com/communities/age_restricted_communities.html | work =Topretirements | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-02 | language = | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080807130116/http://www.topretirements.com/communities/age_restricted_communities.html| archivedate= 7 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age-qualified communities, also known as 55+ communities, active adult communities, lifestyle communities, or [[Retirement community|retirement communities]], are often [[Planned community|planned communities]] that offer homes and community features that are attractive to 55+ adults. These might include a clubhouse or lifestyle center with a good many activities, sometimes with indoor and outdoor swimming pools, exercise facilities, craft rooms, demonstration kitchens, and decks and patios for gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=55 Community Guide | date=July 2008 | publisher= | url =http://www.55communityguide.com/Article/Active_Adult_Communities_What_and_Why.html | work =Active Adult Communities - What and Why? | pages = | accessdate = 2009-07-26 | language = | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090628151422/http://www.55communityguide.com/Article/Active_Adult_Communities_What_and_Why.html| archivedate= 28 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
A noteworthy Canadian example, [[Arbutus Ridge Retirement Community|Arbutus Ridge Seaside Community for Active Adults]] in the [[Cowichan Valley]] on [[Vancouver Island]], was the first comprehensive [[retirement community]] built in Canada. It is a [[private community]] that subsequently became the template and proving ground for what has become accepted and commonplace. In 2015, that template was expanded in line with the growing desire for spiritually focused retirement living as Global Kingdom Ministries unveiled Trinity Ravine Towers in [[Toronto]], one of the country's first Christian community living [[condominium]] complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laura|first1=Robert|title=Religion And Retirement|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlaura/2014/02/28/religion-and-retirement/|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinity Ravine Towers|url=http://www.trinityravine.ca/|website=Trinity Ravine|publisher=Global Kingdom Ministries|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History Global Kingdom Ministries|url=http://globalkingdom.ca/contentpages/30756/e07b407f-07d0-4fc3-8055-a0b3c06e1a83/OurHistory.aspx|website=Global Kingdom Ministries|publisher=Global Kingdom Ministries|accessdate=23 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124100420/http://globalkingdom.ca/contentpages/30756/e07b407f-07d0-4fc3-8055-a0b3c06e1a83/OurHistory.aspx|archive-date=2015-11-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
[[File:Town Square Event.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An entertainment venue at The Villages in Florida.|An entertainment venue at [[The Villages, Florida|Villages in Florida]].]]
According to 55places.com, Florida has the most age-restricted communities with more than 300 communities, with [[New Jersey]] coming in second with more than 230 age-restricted communities.  Other popular states for age-restricted communities include Oregon, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Romero |first=Christine |title=No Millennials Allowed: Boomers Are Flocking to Cool 55-Plus Communities |work=[[Realtor.com]] News |date=2017-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in the [[United States]] discrimination in housing is generally prohibited, the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hud.gov/offices/fheo/FHLaws/yourrights.cfm|title=Fair Housing--it's Your Right|website=U.S. [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD)|access-date=2006-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226091832/http://www.hud.gov/offices/fheo/FHLaws/yourrights.cfm|archive-date=2005-12-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Housing for Older Persons Act]] of 1995 (109 STAT. 787)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1995|title=Housing for Older Persons Act|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ76.104.pdf|author= U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow communities to restrict residency to older individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thorsby |first=Devon |url=https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/7-things-to-know-about-living-in-an-age-restricted-community |title=7 Things to Know About Living in an Age-Restricted Community |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |date=2017-04-07 |accessdate=2017-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may buy into these properties regardless of age; however, the owner may be prohibited from occupying the property according to the association declarations and bylaws.

According to research compiled by TRI Pointe Homes, there are 75 million people who comprise the [[Baby boomers|boomer generation]] and over 32 million of these who are over the age of 55 would consider living in an age-restricted community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff |first=Writer |url=http://www.builderonline.com/builder-100/marketing-sales/tripointe-zeroes-in-on-boomers_o |title=TRIPOINTE ZEROES IN ON BOOMERS |work=Builder |date=2017-11-13 |accessdate=2017-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===
With most age restricted communities, there are [[homeowner association]] (HOA) fees that cover services and amenities to resident such as golf courses, game nights, clubhouses, pools, and landscaping. In the United States, these fees can range from $100 — $500 a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thorsby |first=Devon |url=https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/7-things-to-know-about-living-in-an-age-restricted-community |title=7 Things to Know About Living in an Age-Restricted Community |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |date=2017-04-07 |accessdate=2018-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of age-restricted communities ==
A common problem occurs when the homeowner dies; if the surviving resident does not meet the requirements for ownership, then he or she is forced to sell the home.  This can happen even if the survivor is the ''spouse'' of the deceased. However, many age-restricted communities have circumvented this issue by allowing the survivor to maintain residency as noted in the deed restrictions.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

Another common problem arises when a change in the family situation renders a grandparent responsible for a grandchild. Often grandchildren are prohibited from living more than a short time (often 90 days) in a community.

  | doi = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the most successful preachers of Jamaican [[Revivalism]].

==Life==
After spending time in [[Panama]], he returned to [[Jamaica]] and was [[baptism|baptized]] by a local [[Baptist]] preacher. He became not merely leader of a Revival branch but of a new movement,the  Bedwardites . In the 1880 he started to gather large groups of followers by conducting mass healings services. He identified himself with [[Paul Bogle]], the Baptist leader of the Morant Bay rebellion. In this connection he stressed for changes and developments in the race relations in Jamaican society. He supposedly said: “Brethren! Hell will be your position if you do not rise up and crush the white man.  The time is coming!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palmer|first1=Colin|title=Freedom’s Children: The 1938 Labor rebellion and the Birth of Modern Jamaica|date=2014|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9781469611693}} &lt;/ref&gt;There is a white wall and a black wall. And the white wall has been closing around the black wall: but now the black wall has become bigger than the white.”

Bedward was arrested for [[sedition]] but sent to a [[mental asylum]]. On release he continued his role as a Revival healer and preacher. He stressed his followers to be self-sufficient and at its height the movement gathered about 30,000 followers. He told his followers to sell their possessions including owned land and give him all the profits. Some of these followers did just that. On one occasion, he told his followers that they all would fly back to Africa, however to do so they had to climb up into a breadfruit tree in August Town while wearing bed sheets for the liftoff. However, they told him to go first and it resulted in him breaking his legs where he was submitted to the university hospital of the West Indies.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

He led his followers into [[Garveyism]] by finding the charismatic metaphor: Bedward and Garvey were as [[Aaron]] and [[Moses]], one the [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]], the other [[prophet]], both leading the children of Israel out of exile. Garvey's middle name was considered by people to be a mix of the two names Moses and [[Messiah]].

Later Bedward proclaimed that he was a reincarnation of [[Jesus Christ]] and that, like [[Elijah]], he would ascend into heaven in a flaming chariot. He then expected to rain down fire on those that did not follow him, thereby destroying the whole world. In 1921 he and 800 followers marched in to Kingston “to do battle with his enemies.” This however didn’t result in him flying to heaven. Bedward and his followers were arrested and he was sent to mental asylum for the second time where he remained to the end of his life.

His impact was that many of his followers became Garveyites and [[Rastafarians]], bringing with them the experience of resisting the system and demanding changes of the colonial oppression and the white oppression. Rastafari has taken the idea of Garvey as a prophet, while also casting him in the role of [[John the Baptist]], by virtue of his "voice in the wilderness" call taken as heralding their expected Messiah, "Look to Africa where a black king shall be crowned."

==Followers==
One of the more famous followers of Bedwardism was [[Robert Hinds]], [[Leonard Howell]]'s second in command.

==Songs==
Bedward is mentioned in an early Trinidadian recording of Jamaican mento classic [[Sly Mongoose (song)|Sly Mongoose]] by [[Sam Manning (musician)|Sam Manning]], who recorded it in December 1925 for the Okeh label (the song was recorded by many artists with changing lyrics).  He is mentioned in Jamaican reggae artist Etana's "I Am Not Afraid." He is also mentioned in the Jamaican folk classic "Dip Dem," which was recorded by [[Louise Bennett]] for her 1954 album ''Jamaican Folk Songs''. "Bedward the Flying Preacher" by Singers &amp; Players featuring [[Prince Far I]] appears on the 1983 album ''Staggering Heights'', and the 1985 compilation ''Pay It All Back Vol. 1'', both on Britain's [[On-U Sound]] label.  This was also released as a 7" single on the On-U Sound offshoot Sound Boy in 2003, credited to Prince Far I, with a dub version on the B-side. Prince Pompadoe released a 7" 45 called "Dip them Bedward" on the Pressure Sounds and Prophet labels in 1976. The song was produced by Vivian 'Yabby You' Jackson. It was reissued on the CD Deeper Roots, a compilation of Yabby You productions.

Paul Hamilton also released a 45' entitled "Who say Bedward Fly?"

[[File:CharlesDeGaullespeech18June.JPG|thumb|Memorial plate with Appeal of 18 June, [[Vienne, Isère]]]]
The '''Appeal of 18 June''' ({{lang-fr|L'Appel du 18 juin}}) was a famous [[Speech (public address)|speech]] by [[Charles de Gaulle]], the leader of the [[Free French Forces]], in 1940. The appeal is often considered to be the origin of the [[French Resistance]] to the [[Germany|German]] occupation during [[World War II]]. De Gaulle spoke to the French people from [[London]] after the fall of [[France]]. He declared that the war for France was not yet over, and rallied the country in support of the Resistance. It is regarded as one of the most important speeches in [[History of France|French history]].

In spite of its reputation as the beginning of the Resistance and Free French, historians have shown that the appeal was heard only by a minority of French people. De Gaulle's 22 June 1940 speech on the [[BBC]] was more widely heard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cndp.fr/archivage/valid/3496/3496-198-212.pdf L'Appel du 18 juin] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
General de Gaulle became the ''de facto'' leader of the Free French Forces that had escaped to London in June 1940. Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]], a hero of [[World War I]], had signed an [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|armistice]] with [[Nazism|Nazi]] Germany, and led the collaborating [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government while the Germans occupied the country's northern portion and several leading politicians, including [[Georges Mandel]], [[Leon Blum]], [[Pierre Mendès France]], [[Jean Zay]]  and [[Edouard Daladier]] (and separately [[Paul Reynaud]]), were arrested while travelling to continue the war from [[North Africa]]. De Gaulle opposed the armistice and had fled France on 17 June after Pétain made clear that he would seek an accommodation with the Nazis.

De Gaulle obtained special permission from [[Winston Churchill]] to broadcast a speech on 18 June via [[Radio Londres|BBC Radio]] from [[Broadcasting House]] over France, despite the British Cabinet's objections that such a broadcast could provoke the Pétain government into a closer allegiance with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/greatspeeches/story/0,,2059384,00.html ''The Guardian'', "A Mesmerising Oratory"], 29 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech, de Gaulle reminded the French people that the [[British Empire]] and the [[United States|United States of America]] would support them militarily and economically in an effort to retake France from the Germans.

The BBC did not record the speech,&lt;ref name=BBCREc&gt;[http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1940-1944-la-seconde-guerre-mondiale/l-appel-du-18-juin/documents/l-appel-du-22-juin-1940.php L'Appel du 22 juin 1940] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606021817/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1940-1944-la-seconde-guerre-mondiale/l-appel-du-18-juin/documents/l-appel-du-22-juin-1940.php |date=6 June 2017 }}, ''Charles de Gaulle.org'' (website of the [[:fr:Fondation Charles de Gaulle|Fondation Charles de Gaulle]])&lt;/ref&gt; and few actually heard it. Another speech, which was recorded and heard by more people, was given by de Gaulle four days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Appel_du_22_juin?match=en|title=Appel du 22 Juin - Wikisource|website=fr.wikisource.org|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a record, however, of the manuscript of the speech of 18 June,&lt;ref name=BBCREc/&gt; which has been found in the archives of the [[Swiss intelligence agencies]] who published the text for their own uses on 19 June. The manuscript of the speech, as well as the recording of the 22 June speech, has been classed on 18 June 2005, by the [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/mow/nomination_forms/france_and_uk_appeal_18_june_1940.pdf |format=PDF |title=Memory of the World Register: The Appeal of 18 June 1940 |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=2018-06-19 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation of the speech==
{{Copy section to Wikisource|date=June 2011}}
On 18 June 1940, at 19:00 (GMT), de Gaulle's voice was broadcast nationwide, saying in [[French language|French]] (author. translation):

[[File:Free French monument Jersey.jpg|thumb|This monument commemorates those who passed through [[Jersey]] in response to the appeal.]]

:"The leaders who, for many years, have been at the head of the French armies have formed a government. This government, alleging the defeat of our armies, has made contact with the enemy in order to stop the fighting. It is true, we were, we are, overwhelmed by the mechanical, ground and air forces of the enemy. Infinitely more than their number, it is the tanks, the aeroplanes, the tactics of the Germans which are causing us to retreat. It was the tanks, the aeroplanes, the tactics of the Germans that surprised our leaders to the point of bringing them to where they are today.

:"But has the last word been said? Must hope disappear? Is defeat final? No!

:"Believe me, I who am speaking to you with full knowledge of the facts, and who tell you that nothing is lost for France. The same means that overcame us can bring us victory one day. For France is not alone! She is not alone! She is not alone! She has a vast Empire behind her. She can align with the British Empire that holds the sea and continues the fight. She can, like England, use without limit the immense industry of the United States.

:"This war is not limited to the unfortunate territory of our country. This war is not over as a result of the [[Battle of France]]. This war is a world war. All the mistakes, all the delays, all the suffering, do not alter the fact that there are, in the world, all the means necessary to crush our enemies one day. Vanquished today by mechanical force, in the future we will be able to overcome by a superior mechanical force. The fate of the world depends on it.

:"I, General de Gaulle, currently in London, invite the officers and the French soldiers who are located in British territory or who might end up here, with their weapons or without their weapons, I invite the engineers and the specialised workers of the armament industries who are located in British territory or who might end up here, to put themselves in contact with me.

:"Whatever happens, the flame of the French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished. Tomorrow, as today, I will speak on the radio from London."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Appel_du_18_juin?match=en|title=Appel du 18 Juin - Wikisource|website=fr.wikisource.org|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lehrmaninstitute.org/history/index.html Text of the speech in English] [[Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|The Lehrman Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==
[[File:Jonquières Square du 18 juin 1940.JPG|thumb|left|The speech of 18 June occupies a prominent place in the popular history of France, as in this street named after it in the town of [[Jonquières, Vaucluse|Jonquières]] ]]
Although de Gaulle's speech on 18 June is among the most famous in French history, few French listeners heard it that day. It was broadcast on the BBC, a British radio station, practically unannounced, and given by an obscure brigadier general only recently appointed junior minister. Consequently, of the 10,000 French citizens in Britain, only 300 volunteered and of the more than 100,000 soldiers temporarily on British soil, most of them recently evacuated from [[Norwegian Campaign|Norway]] or [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]], only 7,000 stayed on to join de Gaulle.{{cn|date=June 2018}} The rest returned to France and were quickly made prisoners of war. Despite this, de Gaulle's speech was undeniably influential and provided motivation for the people of France and for the oppressed of the rest of Europe.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The themes of the speech would be reused throughout the war as a means of inspiring French people to resist German occupation.  Four days later, de Gaulle delivered a speech which largely reiterated the points made in his 18 June speech, and this was heard by a larger audience in France. The content of the 22 June speech is often confused for that of 18 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1940-1944-la-seconde-guerre-mondiale/l-appel-du-18-juin/documents/l-appel-du-22-juin-1940.php|title=L'Appel du 22 juin 1940 - charles-de-gaulle.org|website=www.charles-de-gaulle.org|accessdate=5 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606021817/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1940-1944-la-seconde-guerre-mondiale/l-appel-du-18-juin/documents/l-appel-du-22-juin-1940.php|archivedate=6 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in early August a poster written by de Gaulle would be distributed widely in London and would become known as ''L'affiche de Londres'' (The London Poster).&lt;ref name="charles-de-gaulle.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1940-1944-la-seconde-guerre-mondiale/l-appel-du-18-juin/documents/l-affiche-de-londres.php|title=L'affiche "à tous les Français" ayant suivi l'appel du 18 juin - charles-de-gaulle.org|website=www.charles-de-gaulle.org|accessdate=5 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618094523/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1940-1944-la-seconde-guerre-mondiale/l-appel-du-18-juin/documents/l-affiche-de-londres.php|archivedate=18 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of this poster would be produced and displayed in Africa, South America and France itself over the course of the war.&lt;ref name="charles-de-gaulle.org"/&gt;

The '''''Bibliotheca Classica''''' (Reading, November, 1788), or '''''Classical Dictionary containing a full Account of all the Proper Names mentioned in Ancient Authors''''' is the best-known work of [[John Lemprière]], an English classical scholar.  Edited by various later scholars, the dictionary long remained a readable if not absolutely trustworthy reference book in [[mythology]] and [[Classical antiquity|classical history]]. Lemprière wished "to give the most accurate and satisfactory account of all the proper names which occur in reading the Classics, and by a judicious collection of anecdotes and historical facts to draw a picture of ancient times, not less instructive than entertaining."&lt;ref name="lemprière-1788"&gt;{{cite book|first=John |last=Lemprière |year=1788 |title=Bibliotheca Classica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dictionary has been a handbook for teachers, journalists, dramatists and poets for almost 200 years and [[John Keats]] is said to have known the book almost by heart.&lt;ref name="facsimile"&gt;{{cite book|first=John |last=Lemprière |year=1984 |title=Bibliotheca Classica |edition=Facsimile Edition of 1865 |publisher=Bracken Bros. |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Far from being just an ordinary dictionary, however, Lemprière's encyclopedic work is full of incidental details and stories which bring the mythical past to life." It is also assumed that the great scholar [[Richard Valpy]] helped Lemprière with the dictionary.&lt;ref name="facsimile"/&gt;

Many ships of the [[Royal Navy]] were named from Greek and Roman mythology during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], had a copy of this book on his desk and simply plucked a name from within.&lt;ref name="cordingly"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David Cordingly]] |title=The Billy Ruffian: The Bellerophon and the Downfall of Napoleon |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2003 |isbn=0-7475-6544-9 |pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']], HMS ''Charon'', [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']], [[HMS Leander (1780)|HMS ''Leander'']], [[HMS Minotaur (1793)|HMS ''Minotaur'']], [[HMS Pegasus (1779)|HMS ''Pegasus'']], [[HMS Phaeton (1782)|HMS ''Phaeton'']], [[HMS Theseus (1786)|HMS ''Theseus'']], HMS ''Venus''.

==In fiction==
*Lemprière, and specifically the writing of his dictionary, formed the basis for the novel ''Lemprière's Dictionary'' by [[Lawrence Norfolk]].
*In ''The Gaudy'' by J.I.M. Stewart there is a character called Lemprière. The narrator is familiar with the name because of Keats' knowledge of the dictionary.

'''''Burns v Burns''''' [1984] [[Law Reports|Ch]] 317, [1984] 1 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 244) is a case in [[English property law]] dealing with the beneficial [[entitlement]]s of unmarried [[cohabitation|cohabittees]].

==Facts==
The [[plaintiff]], Valerie Burns, lived with the [[defendant]] for 19 years, Patrick Burns, whom she never married. The house had been bought in the name of the defendant who also paid the purchase price with the plaintiff making no financial contributions to the purchase price or [[mortgage]] installments and had acted as a [[homemaker]] performing domestic duties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/pntodd/cases/cases_b/burns.htm Full text of opinion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118141141/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/pntodd/cases/cases_b/burns.htm |date=November 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She had however made financial contributions to the household with regards to household bills and redecorating.

==Judgment==
The judgment of the case was that in the absence of a financial contribution which could be related to the acquisition to the property such as mortgage installments there is no right to a beneficial entitlement to a family home. This decision was affirmed by the [[Lord Justice of Appeal|Lords Justice]] [[Mark Waller (judge)|Waller]], [[Michael Fox (judge)|Fox]] and [[Anthony May (judge)|May]] in the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

'''ComFree''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[real estate broker]] platform.&lt;ref name=FinancialPost.com&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shmuel|first1=John|title=Commission-free real estate network launches in Canada|url=http://www.financialpost.com/related/topics/Commission+free+real+estate+network+launches+Canada/3589986/story.html|website=financialpost.com|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/2015/03/18/comfree-converts-to-licensed-real-estate-broker|title=ComFree converts to licensed real estate broker|website=Winnipeg Sun|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
ByTheOwner, composed of PrivateRealEstate in [[Ontario]], ComFree in [[Alberta]], ComFree in [[Manitoba]], and Skhomes4sale in [[Saskatchewan]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/canadas-largest-commission-free-real-estate-network-launched-545612492.html|title=Canada's largest commission-free real estate network launched|website=www.newswire.ca|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; was acquired by [[DuProprio]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=Radio-Canada.ca&gt;{{cite web|title=DuProprio.com élargit ses horizons|url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/Economie/2010/09/28/009-duproprio-agent.shtml|website=Radio-Canada.ca|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the acquisition, the company was rebranded as the ComFree network.&lt;ref name=LesAffaires.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Duproprio.com change de couleurs|url=http://www.lesaffaires.com/secteurs-d-activite/immobilier/dupropriocom-change-de-couleurs/521330|website=LesAffaires.com|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the two ComFree Commonsense Network brokerages were launched in Ontario and Alberta.&lt;ref name="newswire.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/611641/canada-s-largest-commission-free-real-estate-network-launched|title=Canada's largest commission-free real estate network launched|website=newswire.ca|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, WeList.com joined the ComFree network.&lt;ref name=CalgaryHerald.com&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephenson|first1=Amanda|title=Calgary's WeList.com sold to ComFree real estate network|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/business/Calgary+WeList+sold+ComFree+real+estate+network/8663110/story.html|website=calgaryherald.com|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[DuProprio]] (the site's parent company) was purchased by [[Yellow Pages Group]] for $50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/duproprio-bought-by-yellow-pages-for-50m-1.3115463|title=Yellow Pages to buy DuProprio real-estate network for $50M|website=CBC News|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the company was purchased by [[Purplebricks]], a United Kingdom company also offering commission-free real estate services, for $51 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/yellow-pages-sells-comfree-duproprio-to-purplebricks-for-51-million|title=Yellow Pages sells ComFree/DuProprio to Purplebricks for $51 million|date=2018-07-02|work=Montreal Gazette|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services==
The ComFree network offers different flat-fee service packages to help homeowners sell their homes.  Basic packages include exposure on ComFree.com, lawn signs, and a personalized consultation with a sales rep (depending on location).  The more premium packages offer additional advertising support.  Depending on location, a competitive market analysis may also be available.&lt;ref name="RateSupermarket.ca" /&gt;  In Alberta and Ontario, the ComFree Commonsense Network brokerages enable homeowners to list their homes on REALTOR.ca through a board's MLS system, and allow them to access owner-directed services such as advice on appraisals, and legal and administrative aspects of the home sale in addition to marketing support.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Saskatchewan, ComFree provides flat-fee services via a "for-sale-by-owner" model&lt;ref name="RateSupermarket.ca"&gt;{{cite web|title=For Sale by Owner|url=http://www.ratesupermarket.ca/blog/how-to-for-sale-by-owner/|website=ratesupermarket.ca|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to homeowners who want to sell without a real estate agent.&lt;ref name="TheGlobeandMail.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perkins|first1=Tara|title=How Canada's housing downturn threatens to shake up real estate commissions|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/housing/how-canadas-housing-downturn-threatens-to-shake-up-real-estate-commissions/article12146703/?page=all|website=theglobeandmail.com|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Alberta and Ontario, the services to homeowners are provided by ComFree Commonsense Network brokerage, a brokerage duly registered in each of those two provinces under the applicable real estate/brokerage act.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In Manitoba, the services to homeowners are provided by ComFree Commonsense Network broker, a brokerage duly registered in this province under the applicable real estate/brokerage act.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|title=ComFree earns Manitoba real-estate broker licence|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/comfree-earns-manitoba-real-estate-broker-licence-1.3000115|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1831">'''Common Building Block''' ('''CBB''') was a set of [[technical standard]]s for [[laptop]] components introduced by [[Intel]] in 2005, and adopted by some manufacturers.

==Creation==
In 2004, the Common Building Block program promoted the use of [[industry]]-accepted mechanical and electrical [[Specification (technical standard)|specifications]] for three notebook components: 14.1-inch, 15-inch, and 15.4-inch [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCDs); 9.5mm and 12.7mm [[optical disc]] drives (ODDs); and 2.5-inch [[hard disk drives]] (HDDs). The program consisted of:
*A [[Web site]] to provide a centralized [[wikt:repository|repository]] of information about the program, participants, and platform and ingredient specifications
*A continually updated list of CBB-compliant ingredients (submitted by suppliers)
*A testing and verification service for candidate [[Product (business)|products]]

The defunct repository site mobileformfactors.org was established to standardize components, and included:
*Hard disk drives
*Optical disc drives
*Liquid crystal display panels
*[[Battery pack]]s
*[[Alternating current|AC]]/[[Direct current|DC]] [[power adapter]]s
*[[Computer keyboard|Keyboards]]
*Customizable notebook panels

The '''''Complete Idiot's Guides''''' is a [[Product lining|product line]] of [[how-to]] and other [[reference]] books published by [[Dorling Kindersley]] (DK) that each seek to provide a basic understanding of a complex and popular topic. The term [[idiot (usage)|"idiot"]] is used as [[hyperbole]] in claiming ensured comprehension. The approach relies on explaining a topic via very basic terminology. [[Definitions]] of words, profiles of people, and a synopsis of events for context are also provided in many cases.

The '''Cornaro Atlas''' (Egerton MS 73) is an extensive [[Venice|Venetian]] collection (c. 1489) of nautical charts and tracts, currently held by the [[British Library]].

== Background ==

The Cornaro Atlas is an 80-page [[Venice|Venetian]] manuscript volume, estimated to date c. 1489.  It is named after the [[Cornaro]] family, one of the leading patrician families of the [[Republic of Venice]], who once owned the volume, and whose [[coat of arms]] adorns its frontispiece.  The Cornaro Atlas was brought to England in 1832, and is currently held (Egerton MS 73) by the [[British Library]] in [[London]], UK.

The first half of the volume contains a large collection of nautical charts, faithful copies of  [[portolan chart]]s composed earlier in the 15th century. The second half of the volume is dedicated to a myriad of written tracts on matters of nautical interest (e.g. astronomy, sailing directions, tariffs, etc.)

== Contents of the Atlas ==

The Cornaro atlas has around 80 pages, each page at 53 x 41&amp;nbsp;cm.

=== Calendars ===

Three of the pages are calendars:

* (p.&amp;nbsp;1) – a perpetual astronomical [[calendar]] of lunar revolutions 
* (p.&amp;nbsp;2) – a calendar of [[moveable feast]]s from 1489 to 1600
* (p.&amp;nbsp;79) – a calendar of [[Dominical letter]]s.

=== Nautical charts ===

Following the opening calendars, there are 38 nautical charts depicted in 35 pages (numbered p.&amp;nbsp;3 to p.&amp;nbsp;38).&lt;ref&gt;The charts of the Cornaro Atlas are numbered 69–104 in Uzielli &amp; Amat di San Filippo (1892: [https://books.google.com/books?id=1d8aAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.82ff]), whose numbers are sometimes reference elswewhere.  But here we follow the page numbering of d'Avezac (1850) and the COPAC entry at the British Library.&lt;/ref&gt; All the maps seem to have been copied around the same time and by the same hand.&lt;ref&gt;D'Avezac (1850: [https://books.google.com/books?id=pUwSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.16])&lt;/ref&gt;  Several pages can be grouped together to form a single [[portolan chart]] covering the "normal portolan" range (Black Sea, Mediterranean and Atlantic coast up to the British isles).  Most [[cartographer]]s are named, some of them notables, such as [[Grazioso Benincasa]] of Ancona and [[Petrus Rosell]] of Majorca, others are lesser known.  The last few charts are anonymous.  Notable in this collection are the final charts on West Africa ("Portuguese Guinea") by an anonymous cartographer (often attributed to [[Cristoforo Soligo]]), which seem to be based on a [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] nautical chart. It is one of the few indicators of the existence of Portuguese portolans from before the earliest extant specimens.

'''David Bruce Hendin''' (born December 16, 1945) is an expert American numismatist specializing in ancient Jewish and Biblical coins and their archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accg.us/home.aspx|title=Ancient Coin Collectors Guild|website=www.accg.us|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his career, Hendin has also been known as a medical journalist, newspaper columnist, publishing executive, literary agent, and author. Some of Hendin's books include the groundbreaking bestseller ''Death as a Fact of Life'' as well as the extensive reference ''Guide to Biblical Coins''.

==Early life and education==
David Bruce Hendin was born the son of Dr. Aaron and Celeste Sherman Hendin (died 1948) and Lillian Karsh Hendin (married 1949). Hendin spent his early years in St. Louis. After graduating from [[Ladue Horton Watkins High School]] in 1963, Hendin went on to attend the University of Missouri – Colombia where he received his Bachelor of Science in Biology in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;''Ladue Horton Watkins High School website'',
 [https://alumni.ladueschools.net/distinguished-alumni-2002/ "Distinguished Alumni"]. Accessed 08 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Hendin received his MA Degree from Missouri's School of Journalism. In 2002, Hendin was recognized as one of Ladue's thirty-seven distinguished alumni from the school's 50-year history.

==Jewish-Biblical Numismatic (coins) Expertise==
Hendin's interest in ancient Jewish and Biblical coins began in 1967 during a year-long stint as a biology teacher at an agricultural high school near the Israeli town of Ashkelon. During this time, Hendin learned to speak Hebrew and became fascinated with the study of ancient Jewish and Biblical coins. Aaron Hendin, David's father, had been a long-time collector and student of ancient Jewish coins when he was not working as a physician in St. Louis. David had never shown an interest in his father's hobby, but after his year in Israel, he was hooked on the subject.

The younger Hendin went on to be mentored for decades by international experts in the field. These experts included the well-known Ya’akov Meshorer, professor of Archaeology and Numismatics at Hebrew University and Chief Curator of the Israel Museum, where he founded the numismatic department. Hendin edited and published Meshorer's ''Ancient Jewish Coinage Vols. I &amp; 2'' as well as the English edition of Meshorer's ''A Treasury of Jewish Coins''&lt;ref&gt;Meshorer, Y. Coins Reveal, Jewish Museum, NY (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' Upon Meshorer's death in 2002, Hendin helped establish the Meshorer Prize in Numismatics given by the Israel Museum. He now sits on the board that awards this prize. Also among Hendin's mentors was Dan Barag, professor of Archaeology and Numismatics at Hebrew University and Shraga Qedar, another well-known numismatic scholar.

In 1985 and 1986, Hendin returned to Israel as the chief numismatist of the Joint Sepphoris Project excavations under the auspices of Duke University (Eric and Carol Meyers) and Hebrew University (Ehud Netzer). He again excavated in 2011 with the Duke team. Hendin is a well-known authority on Biblical and ancient Jewish coins. He has published more than 50 articles in this field and has been invited to speak at symposia in Italy, Great Britain, Israel, and the United States. His books and articles about ancient Middle Eastern coins and pre-coinage currency and weights span his 50-year study of the subjects. In 1992, Hendin was elected a Fellow of the American Numismatic Society and is now a Life Fellow. He has donated many significant numismatic and archaeological objects to the Israel Museum, Jerusalem and thus was honored in 2001 as a Sponsor of the Israel Museum. He is also a trustee and adjunct curator at the American Numismatic Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://numismatics.org/About/DavidHendin|title=David Hendin|website=numismatics.org|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalism career==
From 1970 to 1993, David Hendin had a successful career with Scripps Howard's United Feature Syndicate (UFS) and Newspaper Enterprise Association. During his years as a journalist with Scripps Howard, Hendin wrote as a medical journalist. His first column, ''Man and his World,'' was the first syndicated newspaper column on ecology and ran from 1970 until 1973. Following this, Hendin wrote another syndicated newspaper column, ''The Medical Consumer,'' which was published in newspapers nationwide for six years (1973-1979). In 1973, Hendin's book ''Death as a Fact of Life'' was serialized in the ''New York Post'' and other newspapers nationwide. This and Hendin's other books have been translated into Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew, Portuguese and Spanish.

Overall, Hendin wrote more than 1,000 articles for newspapers and magazines, including ''Saturday Review, Reader’s Digest,'' and ''Science News.'' His writing has been hailed as “brilliant and highly sensitive,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Obstetrics of the Soul|last=Broyard|first=A|date=January 25, 1973|work=The New York Times|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by ''The New York Times'' and ''The Washington Post'' praised Hendin's writing as “journalism of the highest order.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Art of Dying|last=Edelson|first=E|date=January 21, 1973|work=The Washington Post Book World|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hendin became the Senior Vice President and Editorial Director for United Feature Syndicate in 1980.

Under Hendin's tenure, UFS launched ''The Supermarket Shopper'' by Martin Sloan, the first newspaper column that led to America's 1980's coupon-clipping craze. In 1992, he was a featured speaker at Ohio State University's Festival of Cartoon Art. From 1971 until 1986, in addition to his work with the UFS, Hendin taught as an Adjunct Professor of Journalism and established a New York Science Journalism program at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. In 1975 and 1976, Hendin lectured as an adjunct professor on science and medical journalism at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. Hendin has served on the boards of trustees of the Scripps Howard Foundation, American Friends of the Bible Lands Museum/Jerusalem'','' the Kinsey Institute for Sex, Gender and Reproduction, The Newspaper Comics Council, the Holy Land Conservation Fund, and the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing. In 1993, Hendin left UFS and became a consultant and literary agent. Prior to his retirement, he counted many talented creators as his clients, including the following:

* Mike Peters
* Lincoln Pierre (BIG NATE®)
* Charles M. Schulz (PEANUTS ®)

The '''Druze power struggle of 1658-1667''' was one of the most violent episodes of tribal disputes during Ottoman rule in the Levant. The conflict erupted between rebel and pro-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Druze]] factions over succession of the [[Maan family|Maani]] rule.

==Background==
{{See|Battle of Anjar}}
In 1624, when the Ottoman Sultan recognized [[Fakhr-al-Din II]] as Lord of Arabistan (from Aleppo to the borders of Egypt),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/az/rescon/mgcdruze.html The Druze of the Levant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309141551/http://www.angelfire.com/az/rescon/mgcdruze.html |date=2012-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Druze]] leader made Tiberias his capital. Fakhr ad Din II, one of the most famous Druze [[Emirs]], was succeeded in 1635 by his nephew Mulhim Ma'an, who ruled through his death in 1658. Fakhr ad Din II's only surviving son, Husayn, lived the rest of his life as a court official in Constantinople. Emir Mulhim exercised [[Iltizam]] taxation rights in the [[Chouf]], Gharb, Jurd, [[Matn District|Matn]], and [[Kisrawan]] districts of Lebanon. Mulhim's forces battled and defeated those of Mustafa Pasha, [[Beylerbey]] of Damascus, in 1642, but he is reported by historians to have been otherwise loyal to Ottoman rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = I.B.Tauris | isbn = 978-1-86064-856-4 | last = Abu-Husayn | first = Abdul-Rahim | title = The view from Istanbul: Lebanon and the Druze Emirate in the Ottoman chancery documents, 1546-1711 | year = 2004 | pages = 21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emir Mulhim Ma'an died in 1658, succeeded by two of his sons.&lt;ref&gt;''The View from Istanbul: Ottoman Lebanon and the Druze Emirate''. P.22. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nMR52fmDlFgC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=druze+galilee+1660&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qbozqIJ0CB&amp;sig=1P8a6wBOnans_YX7uw6QAPSloCM&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=agGpUJreIcTC0QX5woGwDw&amp;ved=0CGoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%201660&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The conflict==
{{Druze|History}}
===Early tensions===
Following Mulhim's death in 1658, his sons Ahmad and Korkmaz (or Qurqmaz)&lt;ref name=harris&gt;Harris W. ''Lebanon: A History, 600-2011''. P.109. Oxford University Press. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jY4ImTGnamUC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=ahmad+ma%27an&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hm-qUKjUDubE0QWJ_ICoCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ahmad%20ma'an&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; entered into a power struggle with other Ottoman-backed Druze leaders.

===Lebanon and Galilee campaign===
In 1660, the Ottoman Empire moved to reorganize the region, placing the [[sanjaks]] (districts) of [[Sidon-Beirut Sanjak|Sidon-Beirut]] and [[Safad Sanjak|Safed]] in a newly formed [[Sidon Province, Ottoman Empire|province of Sidon]], a move seen by local Druze as an attempt to assert control.&lt;ref name=VI22 /&gt; An Ottoman expedition was dispatched to the area following the creation of the new administrative units, initially against the Shihabs and the Shia Hamades.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt; The reformer - grand wazir [[Köprülü Mehmed Pasha]] came in person with the expedition.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt; The Shihabs fled to the Hamades in the high Kisrawan, while the Ottoman troops pillaged [[Wadi al-Taym]].&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

Claiming that the Shihabs allied with the Ma'anis, the Ottomans demanded Ahmad and Korkmuz Ma'an to hand over the Shihabs and provide money for the Ottoman army, but the Ma'anis refused and fled to the Kisrawan as well.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt; The Ma'anis lost control and the Druze of the [[Galilee]] lost their protection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t_amYLJq4SQC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=ahmad+maan+1667&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4dnOVaKBa0&amp;sig=c0LXvl2rPMCvPRmz-JOQw_5V7ow&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sACpUPC_BozL0AXGwoGoCg&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ahmad%20maan%201667&amp;f=false ''A History of the Druzes''. P.45]&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman troops pillaged the area, seeking for the lords of Shihabs, Hamades and Ma'anis, causing "misery" to the peasants.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt; As a result, the pro-Ottoman Druze overran much of the Galilee, most notably destroying the cities of [[1660 destruction of Safed|Safed]] and [[1660 destruction of Tiberias|Tiberias]].

===Political plotting===
Alternative pro-Ottoman [[sheikhs]] - Sirhal Imad and Ali Alam al-Din were briefly installed to rule the Druze country.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

Contemporary historian Istifan al-Duwayhi reports that Korkmaz was killed in act of treachery by the Beylerbey of Damascus in 1662.&lt;ref name=VI22&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = I.B.Tauris | isbn = 978-1-86064-856-4 | last = Abu-Husayn | first = Abdul-Rahim | title = The view from Istanbul: Lebanon and the Druze Emirate in the Ottoman chancery documents, 1546-1711 | year = 2004 | page = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Ahmad Ma'an apparently escaped the plotting.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

In 1666, according to al-Safa, local Shia repulsed the governor of Sidon and a Ma'an force near [[Nabatiyeh]].&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

===Ahmad's victory===
In 1667, Ahmad Ma'an and his supporters defeated the pro-Ottoman Abu Harmoush, Alam al-Din, al-Sawaf and others, and termed [[Qays and Yaman tribes|Yamanis]] near Beirut.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

Ahmad Ma'an emerged victorious in the power struggle among the Druze in 1667, but the Maʿnīs lost control of [[Safad Sanjak|Safad]]&lt;ref name=VI22-23 /&gt; and retreated to controlling the [[iltizam]] of the Chouf mountains and Kisrawan, answerable to the Ottoman governor of Sidon.&lt;ref name=Salibi&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = I.B.Tauris | isbn = 978-1-86064-912-7 | last = Salibi | first = Kamal S. | title = A house of many mansions: the history of Lebanon reconsidered | year = 2005 | page = 66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Abu-Husayn, after 1667 Ahmad Ma'an resumed correspondence with the Tuscans.

==Aftermath==
Ahmad continued as local ruler through his death from natural causes, without heir, in 1697.&lt;ref name=VI22-23&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = I.B.Tauris | isbn = 978-1-86064-856-4 | last = Abu-Husayn | first = Abdul-Rahim | title = The view from Istanbul: Lebanon and the Druze Emirate in the Ottoman chancery documents, 1546-1711 | year = 2004 | pages = 22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Ottoman–Habsburg War (1683–1699)]], Ahmad Ma'n collaborated in a rebellion against the Ottomans which extended beyond his death.&lt;ref name=VI22-23 /&gt; Iltizam rights in Chouf and Kisrawan passed to the rising [[Shihab family]] through female-line inheritance.&lt;ref name=Salibi /&gt; Despite conflicts in the 1660s, the Maan family "played the leading role in the management of the internal affairs of this eyalet until the closing years of the 17th century, perhaps because it was not possible to manage the province-certainly not in the sanjak of Sidon-Beirut-without them."&lt;ref name=POAS&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S002074380002239X | volume = 24 | issue = 04 | pages = 665–675 [673] | last = Abu-Husayn | first = Abdul-Rahim | title = Problems in the Ottoman Administration in Syria During the 16th and 17th Centuries: The Case of the Sanjak of Sidon-Beirut | journal = International Journal of Middle East Studies | accessdate = 2011-04-11 | year = 1992 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2877608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15135">In the [[trading card]] collecting [[hobby]], an '''error card''' is a card that shows incorrect information or some other unintended flaw. It can contain a mistake, such as a misspelling or a photo of someone other than the athlete named on the card.&lt;ref&gt;http://sportscards.about.com/od/sportscardglossary/g/error_card.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on whether the manufacturer noticed the problem while the cards were still being produced, a card may exist in both correct and incorrect versions. If the correction is made sufficiently early in the print run, the error card may be significantly rarer and more valuable than the corrected version.  However, the opposite may be true if the error is corrected late in the printing cycle, resulting in a smaller population of the corrected version of the card compared to the error version.

If the manufacturer never made a correction, the card is considered an "uncorrected error". Often, however, "error card" is used in a more limited sense, meaning only those cards where variant versions exist.

One example of "variations" happened in the 1959 and 1960 [[Topps]] baseball sets.  Certain cards were printed on two different types of cardstock;  one produced a white back, and the other a darker gray.  The photographs and information on the cards themselves were not in error.  The result was that said cards occur in two variations, based on the back color.

==1950 Bowmans==

The Bowman cards of the 1950s contain two notable errors.  The first was not technically an error, but nonetheless resulted in an anomaly in the 1954 Bowman set.  The set featured Ted Williams as card number 66.  Shortly after the set was released, Williams signed an exclusive contract with Topps, Bowman's primary competitor.  Topps featured Williams as the first and last cards in their set that year.  Now barred from using Williams's picture and name, Bowman substituted Williams' teammate Jimmy Piersall as card number 66 in all subsequent printings, duplicating the front and back of Piersall's other card in the series, number 210.

The next year, in their last set before selling out to Topps, Bowman "flipped" the backs of two pairs of cards.  Brothers Milt Bolling of the Red Sox and Frank Bolling of the Tigers and pitchers Don Johnson of the Orioles and Ernie Johnson of the Braves were originally issued with their counterparts' card backs.  Bowman corrected the error and issued cards with the correct backs.

==1950s Topps==

In its 1956 set, Topps issued six team cards, the Cubs, Reds, Orioles, Indians, Braves and Phillies, in three different versions.  The different cards are commonly referred to by collectors as the "dated", "undated" and "centered" cards.  The first release showed a team picture, obviously taken the year before and correctly labeled as "1955 Chicago Cubs, "1955 Cincinnati Reds" and so on.  For some reason, perhaps because it was confusing to have a card labeled "1955" in a 1956 set, Topps reprinted these cards, blacking out the space where the date had appeared.  This resulted in the team name being off-center in the black box where it appeared.  Topps finally issued a third version of all six cards with the team name centered in the box.

Topps's 1957 set contained Yankee great Mickey Mantle as card number 286.  The card is known among collectors as the "ghost Mantle".  Topps editors had long been expert at altering pictures to meet their needs.  For example, the same photo of future major league manager Bob Kennedy appears in the 1954, '55 and '56 Topps sets.  But the photo is airbrushed to show Kennedy in an Indians cap in '54, a Orioles cap in '55 and, finally, a White Sox cap in '56.  The '57 Mantle card shows a posed shot of the switch hitting center fielder finishing a left-handed swing.  The original photo apparently contained someone standing behind Mantle as he swung.  When the card was assembled, the intruder was "blacked out", leaving a perfect silhouette, a "ghost", in back of the Mick.  The outline is far more prominent and clear in some copies of the card than it is on others, inspiring debate among collectors as to whether Topps issued a corrected version, with the interloper better camouflaged.

In the 1957 Topps set, card number 20, of [[Hank Aaron|Henry Aaron]], features a classic example of a "flipped negative".  The photo on the card shows Aaron, a right-handed slugger, batting left-handed.  A closer look at the  number on Aaron's uniform, 44, shows that he was not playing a practical joke on the photographer.  The number is backwards, the result of the photo negative being printed upside down.  Topps never issued a corrected version.

In the 1959 Topps set, Aaron's Braves teammate Lew Burdette fooled the Topps photographer.  Burdette joined with Warren Spahn to form the heart of a pitching staff that would carry the Braves to two consecutive World Series.    The front of his 1959 Topps card, number 440, shows Burdette, a right-handed pitcher, with a glove on his right hand at the top of a left-handed windup.  Topps got revenge on Burdette, however, when they printed his name on the card.  Burdette's middle name, "Lewis" is shortened to "Lou", rather than "Lew".  The year before Topps had taken no chances, identifying him as "Lou" on the front of card number 10, and "Lew" on the back.

==Printing errors==
The Topps 1962 baseball set saw the 'grandaddy' of all error situations.  The set's entire second series (the 87 cards numbered 110 through 196) was first printed and distributed without the proper amount of ink for the photographs;  the result has been known ever since as the "Green Tint" series, for the sky and dirt in the backgrounds of some cards are decidedly green, rather than blue or brown.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psacard.com/articles/article_view.chtml?artid=4374&amp;universeid=314&lt;/ref&gt;  All the photos were somewhat out of focus, and card number 159 (Yankees Pitcher [[Hal Reniff]]) was incorrectly numbered as 139.

The entire series was re-printed and re-distributed, with the photo inks in proper proportion and with eight photos replaced with different poses (Reniff's among them).  All remaining photos were re-cropped for the re-printing (e.g., some photos were moved a bit to one side, and others moved up or down), thus giving every card in the series an error card.  The Reniff card's number was still incorrect in this second printing, so a third, corrected one of his was produced, resulting in one 'true' Reniff card and 2 errors (each error card with a different photograph).

The "wrongback" error occurs when the sheet is mated with a back which is upside down or reversed. Most wrongbacks have the backs off center. It is possible to find a centered back and off center front.

The blankback or blankfront error is a type of error where the back or front of the card is blank. Most likely however, these are first run proofs from the company not intended for distribution.  In addition, misspelled words/names, print blotches, missing border sections, and different colored backgrounds (like the 1973 manager cards) are all considered errors although relatively few of these are corrected.

==Washington Nat'l League - 1974==
The 1974 "Washington Nat'l League" cards are considered errors too, but were corrected during the run.  This came about when there was a strong possibility that the [[San Diego Padres]] might move to Washington after the 1973 season.  Anticipating that possibility, Topps substituted the term "Washington Nat'l League" onto early-series Padres' cards, since the nickname of the potentially re-located team was not known.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Washington_%22Nat'l_League%22&lt;/ref&gt;

==1989 Billy Ripken card==
Billy Ripken is also remembered for an infamous [[baseball card]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/sports/baseball/ripken.htm The 1989 Billy Ripken Fleer Baseball Card, Before and After" (Snopes.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, William. ''[[Big Secrets|Biggest Secrets]]''. page 155.&lt;/ref&gt;
In {{baseball year|1989}}, Ripken's [[Fleer]] card showed the player holding a bat with the [[Profanity|expletive]] ''fuck face'' written in plain view on the knob of the bat.&lt;ref name="cnbc.com"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=CNBC |title=Billy Ripken Obscenity Bat: He Finally Talks 20 Years Later |first=Darren |last=Rovell |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/28116692 |date=December 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleer subsequently rushed to correct the error, and in their haste, released versions in which the text was scrawled over with a marker, whited out with [[correction fluid]], and also airbrushed. On the final, corrected version, Fleer obscured the offensive words with a black box (this was the version included in all factory sets). Both the original card and many of the corrected versions have become collector's items as a result. There are at least ten different variations of this card. As of February 2009 the white out version has a book value of $120.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billripken.com/index/10BATS.jpg Baseball card variations, from billripken.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Ripken admitted to having written the expletive on the bat; however, he claimed he did it to distinguish it as a batting practice bat, and did not intend to use it for the card.&lt;ref name="cnbc.com"/&gt;

==1990 Pro Set Football==
The 1990 [[Pro Set trading cards|Pro Set]] football card release has several errors and variations. Due to a contractual dispute, the Pro Bowl card of [[Eric Dickerson]] (No. 338) was withdrawn early creating a short print. Card #338 would be reissued with Ludwell Denny on the front and it was a promotional card not available in packs.&lt;ref name="sportscardarticles.com"&gt;http://sportscardarticles.com/football_cards/1990_pro_set_football.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Card #75 in the set was meant to be Browns Center Cody Risen but the card was withdrawn early, resulting in a short print. Another variation from 1990 Pro Set is card #204, featuring [[Fred Marion]] of the New England Patriots. This card is rather controversial as it features San Francisco 49ers player [[John Taylor (American football)|John Taylor]] in the background and the belt from Taylor's pants are undone. The positioning of the belt gives the appearance that his private area is exposed but it is just a shadow and the belt. 
*Other errors and variations in the 1990 Pro Set football set include:

[[File:Energy label 2010.svg|thumb|right|Example EU energy label for a refrigerator.]]
[[EU Directive]] 92/75/EC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31992L0075:EN:NOT |title=Council Directive 92/75/EEC of 22 September 1992 on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by household appliances |publisher=Europa (web portal) |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; established an [[energy consumption]] labelling scheme. The directive was implemented by several other directives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/consumers/product_labelling_and_packaging/l32004_en.htm |title=Summaries of EU legislation &gt; Consumers &gt; Product labelling and packaging &gt; Household appliances: energy consumption labelling (until 2011) |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus most [[white goods]], light bulb packaging and cars must have an '''EU Energy Label''' clearly displayed when offered for sale or rent. The [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of the appliance is rated in terms of a set of '''energy efficiency classes''' from A to G on the label, A being the most energy efficient, G the least efficient. The labels also give other useful information to the customer as they choose between various models. The information should also be given in catalogues and included by internet retailers on their websites.

In an attempt to keep up with advances in energy efficiency, A+, A++ and A+++ grades were later introduced for various products; since 2010, a new type of label exists that makes use of pictograms rather than words, to allow manufacturers to use a single label for products sold in different countries.

Directive 92/75/EC was replaced by Directive 2010/30/EU&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32010L0030%20:EN:NOT |title=Directive 2010/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy-related products |publisher=Europa (web portal) |date= |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which must be applied from 31 July 2011.

==Major appliances==
[[File:Energy label en.svg|thumb|150px|right|Pre-2010 energy label for a washing machine.]]

===Labelling===
The energy labels are separated into at least four categories:
*The appliance's details: according to each appliance, specific details, of the model and its materials
*Energy class: a colour code associated to a letter (from A to G) that gives an idea of the appliance's electrical consumption
*Consumption, efficiency, capacity, etc.: this section gives information according to appliance type
*Noise: the noise emitted by the appliance is described in [[decibel]]s

===Refrigerating appliances===
For refrigerating appliances, such as [[refrigerator]]s, [[freezer]]s, wine-storage appliances, and combined appliances, the labelling is specified in terms of an [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] index EEI, which is an indication of the annual power consumption relative to a reference consumption that is based on the storage volume and the type of appliance (refrigerator or freezer).&lt;ref&gt;
[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32010R1060:EN:NOT Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1060/2010 of 28 September 2010 supplementing Directive 2010/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to energy labelling of household refrigerating appliances]. EU (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary between the A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and A classes is 44 up to 1 July 2014, and 42 after that date.

{{EU energy label A3-G|Refrigerating appliances, as EEI
|&lt;22 |&lt;33 |&lt;42/44 |&lt;55 |&lt;75 |&lt;95 |&lt;110 |&lt;125 |&lt;150 |&gt;150}}

The label also contains:
*the annual energy consumption in kW·h
*the capacity of fresh foods in litres for refrigerators and combined appliances
*the capacity of frozen foods in litres for freezers and combined appliances
*the noise in [[A-weighting|dB(A)]]

For cold appliances (and this product alone), for models that are more economical than those of category A, categories A+, A++ and A+++ have been assigned.

===Washing machines and tumble dryers===
Up to 2010, the [[Electrical efficiency|energy efficiency]] scale for [[washing machines]] is calculated based on a cotton cycle at 60&amp;nbsp;°C (140&amp;nbsp;°F) with a maximum declared load. This load is typically 6&amp;nbsp;kg. The energy efficiency index is in kW·h per kilogramme of washing, assuming a cold-water supply at 15&amp;nbsp;°C.
{{EU energy label A-G|Washing machines (pre-2010), in kWh/kg
|&lt;0.19|&lt;0.23|&lt;0.27|&lt;0.31|&lt;0.35|&lt;0.39|&gt;0.39}}
The energy label also contains information on:
*total consumption per cycle
*washing performance – with a class from A to G
*spin drying performance – with a class from A to G
*maximum spin speed
*the total cotton capacity in kg
*water consumption per cycle in litres
*noise in the washing and spinning cycles dB(A)

The washing performance is measured according to European harmonised standard EN 60456 and is based on a 60&amp;nbsp;°C cycle on fabric samples with stains of oil, blood, chocolate, milk, and red wine, using a standardised detergent and compared against a reference washing machine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebpg.bam.de/de/ebpg_medien/014_studyf_08-12_part1-2.pdf Preparatory Studies for Eco-design. Requirements of EuPs. LOT 14: Domestic Washing Machines and Dishwashers] Final report (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of stain removal is then translated into a washing performance index.
{{EU energy label A-G|Washing performance index|&gt;1.03|&gt;1.00|&gt;0.97|&gt;0.94|&gt;0.91|&gt;0.88|&lt;0.88}}
The spin-drying efficiency class is based on the remaining moisture content (RMC), which is the mass of water divided by the dry mass of cotton fabrics. It is based on a weighted average of full-load and partial-load cycles.
{{EU energy label A-G|Spin-drying efficiency class (as remaining moisture content)|&lt;45|&lt;54|&lt;63|&lt;72|&lt;81|&lt;90|&gt;90}}

A new energy label, introduced in 2010, is based on the energy efficiency index (EEI), and has energy classes in the range A+++ to D.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32010R1061:EN:NOT Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1061/2010 of 28 September 2010 supplementing Directive 2010/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to energy labelling of household washing machines Text with EEA relevance]. EU (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The EEI is a measure of the annual electricity consumption, and includes energy consumed during power-off and standby modes, and the energy consumed in 220 washing cycles. For the washing cycles, a weighted mix consisting of 42% full-load cycles at 60&amp;nbsp;°C, 29% partial-load cycles at 60&amp;nbsp;°C, and 29% partial-load cycles at 40&amp;nbsp;°C. The washing performance is not mentioned any more, since all washing machines must reach class A anyway. For a 6-kg machine, an EEI of 100 is equivalent to 334 kWh per year, or 1.52 kWh per cycle.
{{EU energy label A3-D|Washing machines 2010 rating: energy efficiency index (EEI)|&lt;46|46-52|52-59|59-68|68-77|77-87|&gt;87}}

For tumble dryers the energy efficiency scale is calculated using the cotton drying cycle with a maximum declared load. The energy efficiency index is in kW·h per kilogramme of load. Different scales apply for condenser and vented dryers.
{{EU energy label A-G|Condenser dryers, in kWh/kg|&lt;0.55|&lt;0.64|&lt;0.73|&lt;0.82|&lt;0.91|&lt;1.00|&gt;1.00}}
{{EU energy label A-G|Vented dryers, in kWh/kg|&lt;0.51|&lt;0.59|&lt;0.67|&lt;0.75|&lt;0.83|&lt;0.91|&gt;0.91}}

The label also contains:
*the energy consumption per cycle
*the total cotton capacity
*whether the unit is vented or condensing
*noise in dB(A)

For combined washer dryers the energy efficiency scale is calculated using the cotton drying cycle with a maximum declared load. The energy efficiency index is in kW·h per kilogramme of load. Different scales apply for condenser and vented dryers.
{{EU energy label A-G|Combined washer dryers, in kWh/kg
|&lt;0.68|&lt;0.81|&lt;0.93|&lt;1.05|&lt;1.17|&lt;1.29|&gt;1.29}}

The label also contains:
*the energy consumption per cycle (washing and drying)
*the energy consumption per cycle – washing only
*washing performance – with a class from A to G
*the maximum spin speed
*the total cotton capacity (washing and drying separately)
*water consumption for a full load washed and dried – note that condenser dryers may use significant amounts of water on the drying cycle
*noise in dB (A) (separately for washing, spinning and drying)

===Dishwashers===
The energy efficiency of a dishwasher is calculated according to the number of place settings. For the most common size of appliance, the 12 place setting machine the following classes apply up to 2010. 
{{EU energy label A-G|Dishwashers (12 place settings, in kWh; pre-2010)|&lt;1.06|&lt;1.25 |&lt;1.45 |&lt;1.65 |&lt;1.85 |&lt;2.05 |&gt;2.05 }}
After 2010, a new system is used, based on an energy efficiency index (EEI), which is based on the annual power usage, based on stand-by power consumption and 280 cleaning cycles, relative to the standard power usage for that type of dishwasher. For a 12-place-setting dishwasher, an EEI of 100 corresponds to 462 kWh per year.
{{EU energy label A3-D|Dishwashers (as EEI; after 2010)|&lt;50 |&lt;56 |&lt;63 |&lt;71 |&lt;80 |&lt;90 |&gt;90 }}

The label also contains:
*the energy consumption in kW·h /cycle
*the efficiency of the washing cycle with a class from A to G
*the efficiency of the drying cycle with a class from A to G
*the capacity as a number of place settings
*the water consumption in litres per cycle
*noise in dB(A)

===Ovens===
For ovens, the label also contains:
*the efficiency with a class from A to G
*the energy consumption in kW/h
*the volume in litres
*the type (small/medium/large)

==Air conditioners==
For [[air conditioner]]s, the directive applies only to units under 12&amp;nbsp;kW. Every label contains the following information:
*the model,
*the energy efficiency category from A to G,
*the annual energy consumption (full load at 500 hr per year)
*the cooling output at full load in kW
*the energy efficiency ratio in cooling mode at full load
*the appliance type (cooling only, cooling/heating)
*the cooling mode (air- or water-cooled)
*the noise rating in dB (where applicable)
Labels for air conditioners with heating capability also contain:
*the heat output at full load in kW
*the heating mode energy efficiency category
{{EU energy label A-G|Air conditioners, cooling [[Energy efficiency ratio|EER]] in W/W|&gt;3.2 |3.0–3.2|2.8–3.0|2.6–2.8|2.4–2.6|2.2–2.4|&lt;2.2 }}

Note that there exist units with EER and COP &gt; 5, so take a note of the actual number when it is A rated.

==Light bulbs==
[[Image:EU lamp energy classes.svg|thumb|300px|Energy classes of light bulbs in terms of luminous flux and power consumption]]

Every label of light bulbs and tubes (including [[incandescent light bulb]]s, [[fluorescent lamp]]s, [[LED lamp]]s) contains the following information:
*the energy efficiency category from A to G
*the [[luminous flux]] of the bulb in [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s
*the electricity consumption of the lamp in watts
*the average life length in hours

According to the light bulb's electrical consumption relative to a standard (GLS or incandescent), the lightbulb is in one of the following classes:&lt;ref name="European Union"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31998L0011:EN:NOT|title=Commission Directive 98/11/EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75/EEC with regard to energy labelling of household lamps|publisher=European Union|year=1998 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{EU energy label A-G|Light bulbs; relative energy consumption
|&lt;18–25%|&lt;60%|&lt;80%|&lt;95%|&lt;110%|&lt;130%|&gt;130%}}
Class A is defined in a different way; hence, the variable percentage. These lamp classes correspond roughly to the following lamp types&lt;ref name="EU-lamp-faq"/&gt;

Since 2012 &lt;ref name="European Union 26/9/2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1442846813206&amp;uri=CELEX:32012R0874|title=Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 874/2012 of 12 July 2012 supplementing Directive 2010/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to energy labelling of electrical lamps and luminaires Text with EEA relevance}}&lt;/ref&gt; A+ and A++ classes are added and are introduced different classes for directional lamps and non-directional lamps.
{{EU energy label table|New Non-directional lamps EEI|A++|A+|A|B|C|D|E| &lt;11% | &lt;17% | &lt;24% | &lt;60% | &lt;80% | &lt;95% | &gt;95% }}
Directional lamps are defined as "having at least 80 % light output within a solid angle of π sr (corresponding to a cone with angle of 120°)".&lt;ref name="European Union 26/9/2012" /&gt;

Since September 2009, household light bulbs must be class A, with the exception of clear (transparent) lamps. For the latter category, lamps must be class C or better, with a transition period up to September 2012, and class B after September 2016.&lt;ref name="EU-lamp-faq"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/lumen/doc/full_faq-en.pdf Frequently asked questions on the regulation phasing out conventional incandescent bulbs]. European Union, 2009 (?)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calculation===
{{Update section|date=August 2017}}
Incandescent and fluorescent lamps with and without an integrated [[Electrical ballast|ballast]] can be divided into energy efficiency classes. The division of lamps into such classes was made in EU Directive 98/11/EC&lt;ref name="European Union" /&gt; on 27 January 1998, and includes lamps that are not marketed for use in the home. Light sources with an output of more than 6,500 lm and those that are not operated on line voltage are excluded. The energy efficiency class is determined as follows (Φ is the luminous flux in lm and ''P'' is the power consumption of the lamp in W):

Lamps are classified into class A if:
:&lt;math&gt;P  \leq 0.240  \cdot \sqrt{\Phi} + 0.0103 \cdot \Phi.&lt;/math&gt;
Fluorescent lamps without integrated ballast, are classified into class A if:
:&lt;math&gt;P  \leq 0.150  \cdot \sqrt{\Phi} + 0.0097 \cdot \Phi.&lt;/math&gt;

The classification in the energy efficiency class B-G is based on the percentage (Energy Efficiency Index) at the reference power
:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{R} = \begin{cases}
0.88\cdot\sqrt{\Phi}+0.049\cdot\Phi&amp;(\Phi&gt;34\mbox{ lm})\\
0.2\cdot\Phi&amp;(\Phi\leq34\mbox{ lm})
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
about the power consumption of a standard light bulb with the same luminous flux.

==Television==
In 2010, an energy label for televisions was introduced.&lt;ref name="eu-televisions"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010R1062&amp;qid=1395837474289&amp;from=EN  COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU)  No 1062/2010 of 28.9.2010 supplementing Directive 2010/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to energy labelling of televisions], European Union (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy class is based on the Energy Efficiency Index (EEI), which is the power consumption relative to a reference power consumption. The reference power consumption of a normal television with screen area ''A'' is
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{ref}} = P_{\mathrm{basic}} + 4.3224\, \mathrm{[W/dm^2]}\cdot A.&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{basic}}&lt;/math&gt; = 20 W for a television set with one tuner/receiver and no hard disc.

Since the switch to digital terrestrial transmissions all new televisions sold in Europe have both analogue and digital tuners so the reference power was increased to 24 Watts as set out in the directive the formula is as follows
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{ref}} = 24\, \mathrm{[W]} + 4.3224\, \mathrm{[W/dm^2]}\cdot A&lt;/math&gt; for television sets with two or more tuners/receivers.

Adding of a hard drive(s), then the formula is as follows
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{ref}} = 28\, \mathrm{[W]} + 4.3224\, \mathrm{[W/dm^2]}\cdot A&lt;/math&gt; for television sets with hard disc(s) and two or more tuners/receivers.

For example, a television with a diagonal of 82&amp;nbsp;cm (32&amp;nbsp;in) has a screen area ''A'' = 28.7 [[decimetre|dm]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a reference power consumption of 144&amp;nbsp;W. The energy classes are as in the table below.
{{EU energy label A3-G|Televisions, as EEI(%) |&lt;10|&lt;16|&lt;23|&lt;30|&lt;42|&lt;60|&lt;80|&lt;90|&lt;100|&gt;100}}

The annual on-mode energy consumption ''E'' in kWh is calculated as ''E'' = 1,46 × P.

In televisions with automatic brightness control, the on-mode power consumption is reduced by 5% if the following conditions are fulfilled when the television is placed on the market:
(a)
the luminance of the television in the home-mode or the on-mode condition as set by the supplier, is automatically reduced between an ambient light intensity of at least 20 lux and 0 lux;
(b)
the automatic brightness control is activated in the home-mode condition or the on-mode condition of the television as set by the supplier.

==Cars==
[[File:Irish Car CO2 Label.svg|right|thumb|300px|An Irish Car CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Label]]
For motor-vehicle it isn't electrical efficiency that is indicated but [[carbon dioxide]] emissions in grams per kilometre travelled.
{{EU energy label A-G|Cars, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission in g/km
|&lt;100  |&lt;120 |&lt;140 |&lt;160 |&lt;200 |&lt;250 |&gt;250 }}

Other information that is indexed for the energy label is:
*its brand
*its model
*its version
*its fuel
*its transmission type
*its weight
*the different consumptions of fuel
**mixed consumption
**urban consumption
**extra-urban consumption
*the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in grammes per kilometre

==Tyres==
[[Tire label|European tyre labels]] came into force in November 2012. The tyre labelling will show three [[Tire|tyre]] performance attributes; rolling resistance, wet grip and external rolling noise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rezulteo-tyres.co.uk/tyre-label/forthcoming-tyre-performance-labelling-2191/ "Forthcoming tyre performance labelling"] Rezulteo tyres, Retrieved 7 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The tyre label apply to 
*Car and SUV tyres
*Van tyres
*Truck tyres

with the exception of 
*Tyres for cars made before 1 Oct 1990
*Re-treaded tyres
*Motorcycle tyres
*Racing/sports car tyres
*Studded tyres
*Spare tyres
*Vintage car tyres
*Professional off-road tyres

The '''''Flora of Tropical East Africa''''' ('''FTEA''') is a catalogue of all 12,104 known wild plant species in [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Tanzania]]. The project began in 1948 and was finally completed in September 2012. Approximately 1,500 new plant species were described, by 135 botanists from 21 countries.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/19586735|title=Tropical East Africa's epic flora survey completed|date=13 September 2012|work=BBC Nature|publisher=British Broadcasting Company|accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Flora of Tropical East Africa'', a project of [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], is the largest regional tropical [[Flora (publication)|Flora]] ever compiled. The species covered include 3-4% of the world's known plant species. When the project began in 1948, botanists thought they would be finished in fifteen years. Just in the last four years, 114 new species were described.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kew2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kew.org/science-research-data/directory/projects/FloraTropEAfrica.htm|title=Flora of Tropical East Africa|publisher=Kew Royal Botanic Gardens|accessdate=15 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919044506/http://www.kew.org/science-research-data/directory/projects/FloraTropEAfrica.htm|archivedate=19 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FTEA is an important tool for conservation of plants, wildlife, and habitat in the entire region. Approximately 2,500 of the species are [[endemic]], or unique, to the area. The project will be used in collaboration with groups such as the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] in order to protect those species threatened with habitat loss or extinction.&lt;ref name="Kew1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kew.org/news/flora-of-tropical-east-africa.htm|title=60 year project documenting plants of East Africa celebrated at Kew Gardens|date=13 September 2012|work=Kew News|publisher=Kew Royal Botanic Gardens|accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6527">'''GWAS Central''' (previously HGBASE, HGVbase and HGVbaseG2P) is a publicly available [[database]] of summary-level findings from [[genetic association]] studies in humans, including [[genome-wide association studies]] (GWAS).

It is funded through the [[GEN2PHEN]] project by the European Union under their [[Seventh Framework Programme]].

==Scope==
GWAS Central contains the most comprehensive collection of summary-level [[p-value]] GWAS data. The web resource employs powerful graphical and text based data presentation methods for discovery of and simultaneous [[Scientific visualization|visualisation]] and [[co-examination]] of many studies, at genome-wide and region-specific levels. Studies of interest can now be identified using [[chromosomal region]]s/[[gene]]s and markers; there is also the facility for researchers to view their own data alongside selected studies.

Current content includes ‘top’ p-values from collections; [[supplementary data]]; direct researcher submissions; and publicly available data. Consequently, the database now hosts &gt;21 million p-values and 708 studies (vs 3,948 p-values and 798 studies in the [[NHGRI]] GWAS catalog), representing ~5% of all such data yet produced. GWAS Central makes parts of its data freely available for [[download]] by the research community. However, only parts of the data may be downloaded freely, the whole database content can be accessed as part of a collaboration.

==History==
The Human Genome Bi-Allelic SEquence ([[HGBASE]]) database&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brookes|first=AJ|author2=Lehväslaiho, H |author3=Siegfried, M |author4=Boehm, JG |author5=Yuan, YP |author6=Sarkar, CM |author7=Bork, P |author8=Ortigao, F |title=HGBASE: a database of SNPs and other variations in and around human genes.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=2000-01-01|volume=28|issue=1|pages=356–60|pmid=10592273|doi=10.1093/nar/28.1.356|pmc=102467}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first version of what is now GWAS Central.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=T|author2=Hastings, RK |author3=Gollapudi S |author4=Free, RC |author5=Brookes, AJ. |title=GWAS Central: a comprehensive resource for the comparison and interrogation of genome-wide association studies.|journal=Eur J Hum Genet|date=2014-07-01|volume=22|issue=7|pages=949–52|pmid=24301061|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2013.274|pmc=4060122}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first released in August 1998, focusing on providing a centralized collection of known human single nucleotide polymorphisms and other simple [[DNA]] variants. It was the first publicly available SNP database. The project was expanded over the next year by a consortium including the [[Karolinska Institute]], the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] and the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]]. Corporate support was provided by [[Pfizer]] and [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. The version released in November 2001 was renamed the Human Genome Variation database (HGVbase),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fredman|first=D|author2=Siegfried, M |author3=Yuan, YP |author4=Bork, P |author5=Lehväslaiho, H |author6=Brookes, AJ |title=HGVbase: a human sequence variation database emphasizing data quality and a broad spectrum of data sources.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=2002-01-01|volume=30|issue=1|pages=387–91|pmid=11752345|doi=10.1093/nar/30.1.387|pmc=99093}}&lt;/ref&gt; as this was a better reflection of the scope of the database and its emphasis on collection from many different laboratories. In addition this also highlighted its new role as a central repository for [[data collection]] efforts in collaboration with the [http://www.hgvs.org Human Genome Variation Society].

HGVbase was scaled back in 2004 to simply provide an alternative representation of the full marker list from [[dbSNP]], but development continued on its successor: the Human Genome Variation Genotype-to-Phenotype database (HGVbaseG2P),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thorisson|first=GA|author2=Lancaster, O |author3=Free, RC |author4=Hastings, RK |author5=Sarmah, P |author6=Dash, D |author7=Brahmachari, SK |author8=Brookes, AJ |title=HGVbaseG2P: a central genetic association database.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=Jan 2009|volume=37|issue=Database issue|pages=D797-802|pmid=18948288|doi=10.1093/nar/gkn748|pmc=2686551}}&lt;/ref&gt; in many ways the natural evolution of HGVbase into a central database for summary-level genetic association data. The work was originally funded by [[GlaxoSmithKline]], the [[University of Leicester]], and the European Community's [[Sixth Framework Programme]] ('INFOBIOMED' [[Network of Excellence]]), but the GEN2PHEN project became the main source of funds in 2008. Early work in the project involved devising a powerful way of modeling [[phenotype]] and [[genotype]]- phenotype data, which itself was adopted and adapted to become the global standard Phenotype And Genotype Experiment Object model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brookes AJ, Lehvaslaiho H, Muilu J, Shigemoto Y, Oroguchi T, Tomiki T, Mukaiyama A, Konagaya A, Kojima T, Inoue I, Kuroda M, Mizushima H, Thorisson GA, Dash D, Rajeevan H, Darlison MW, Woon M, Fredman D, Smith AV, Senger M, Naito K, Sugawara H |title=The phenotype and genotype experiment object model (PaGE-OM): a robust data structure for information related to DNA variation|journal=Human Mutation|date=31 May 2009|volume=30|issue=6|pages=968–977|doi=10.1002/humu.20973|pmid=19479963}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 HGVbaseG2P went live and extended the project's content and scope by adding a far broader and more comprehensive range of markers (i.e., [[SNPs]], structural variants, and STSs), along with association data from many genetic association studies.

In February 2010, the project was once again renamed to GWAS Central, to reflect the growing focus on [[genome-wide association studies]]. GWAS Central is a core component of the GEN2PHEN project and intends to provide an operational model, plus an open-source [[software]] package, so others can create similar databases across the world. These will be hosted by institutes, consortia, and even individual laboratories; providing those groups a toolkit for publicising and publishing their genetic association findings on the web and examine their data alongside others data from similar valuable resources.

'''Gibborim''' (from the singular גִּבֹּר, גִּבּוֹר ''gibbor'') is a [[Hebrew]] word that can be glossed "mightiest" which is an intensive for ''gabar'' (גּבר) that can be glossed "mighty". Many times it is used of people who are valiant, mighty, or of great stature. There is some confusion about Gibborim as a class of beings because of its use in {{bibleref2|Genesis|6:4}}, which describes the [[Nephilim]] as mighty (''gibborim'').

The word ''gibborim'' is used in the [[Tanakh]] over 150 times and applied to men as well as lions ({{bibleref2|Proverbs|30:30}}), hunters ({{bibleref2|Genesis|10:9}}), soldiers ({{bibleref2|Jeremiah|51:30}}) and leaders ({{bibleref2|Daniel|11:3}}).

In modern Hebrew the word "gibbor" (the singular form of ''gibborim''), equates with "hero" (if noun), or "brave" (if adjective).

'''Grant Geissman''' (born April 13, 1953) is an American jazz guitarist and Emmy-nominated composer. He has recorded extensively for several labels since 1976 and played guitar on the theme for ''Monk'' and other TV series.

==Career==
Geissman was born in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], California and grew up in  [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].&lt;ref name="Collar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collar|first1=Matt|title=Grant Geissman|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/grant-geissman-mn0000740861/biography|website=AllMusic|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took guitar lessons from local musicians, such as Geoff Levin (of the pop group [[People!]]), Bud Dimock, Don Cirallo, and Terry Saunders. Encouraged by these teachers to learn jazz standards and to improvise, he began playing in rock bands on weekends and also with small jazz groups and big bands. As a high school senior, he entered formal study with avant-garde guitarist [[Jerry Hahn]], who introduced him to the music of [[Charlie Parker]], [[Miles Davis]], [[John Coltrane]], and [[Ornette Coleman]].

After graduating from [[Prospect High School (Saratoga, California)|Prospect High School]], Geissman attended De Anza Junior College, where he played in both De Anza's jazz band and the Daddio Band (of older professionals). Both were led by jazz educator Herb Patnoe, who was the director of [[Stan Kenton]]'s Jazz Clinics.&lt;ref name="Collar" /&gt; Since the Kenton band at that time had no guitar player, Patnoe recommended Geissman to teach at Kenton's summer clinics in both Sacramento and in southern California. While teaching at these clinics for several summers, Geissman first met (and played with) drummer [[Peter Erskine]] and pianist Dan Haerle.

In 1973, Geissman moved to Los Angeles and attended one semester at [[Cal State Fullerton]],&lt;ref name="Collar" /&gt; where he played in the band led by pianist and clarinetist [[Tom Ranier]]. Transferring to [[Cal State Northridge]] in 1974 to be closer to the Hollywood studio scene, Geissman joined the Northridge "A" band led by jazz educator Joel Leach. While at Northridge, he began playing in both [[Gerald Wilson]]'s Big Band and with [[Louie Bellson]]'s Big Band, recording several albums with Bellson. For ''Louie Bellson's Live at the Concord Summer Festival'', Geissman contributed an original composition, "Starship Concord." He began playing in local jazz venues with Tony Rizzi's guitar band, recording ''Tony Rizzi's Five Guitars Play Charlie Christian'' (1976), which featured Tom Ranier and [[Pete Christlieb]].

Geissman's  first gig with fluegelhornist [[Chuck Mangione]] was at the Santa Monica Civic auditorium on November 9, 1976. A short tour of the Pacific Northwest followed, and soon after Mangione asked Geissman to become a permanent member of the band. Mangione's band consisted of Geissman on guitar, Charles Meeks on bass, Chris Vadala on woodwinds, and James Bradley Jr. on drums. Geissman appeared on the album ''[[Feels So Good (Chuck Mangione album)|Feels So Good]]'' (1977), which sold two million copies. On radio, the single "[[Feels So Good (composition)|Feels So Good]]", featuring Geissman's guitar solo, was an international hit. A 1980 issue of ''Current Biography'' called it the most recognized tune since "[[Michelle (song)|Michelle]]" by [[The Beatles]].

In 1978 Geissman released his first solo album, ''Good Stuff'' ([[Concord Jazz]]),&lt;ref name="Collar" /&gt; which featured fellow Northridge alumnus [[Gordon Goodwin]] on sax, Tom Ranier on piano, Bob Magnussen on bass guitar, and Steve Shaeffer on drums. Grant left Mangione's band in 1981 to pursue other endeavors, including his own albums, session work, and composing. Two of his albums (''Flying Colors'' and ''Time Will Tell'') reached number one in the Gavin and Radio and Records Contemporary Jazz airplay charts, and many his recordings reached the top ten.

Geissman has been a regular member of [[Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band]].&lt;ref name="Coveney"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coveney|first1=Janine|title=Gordon Goodwin: The Phat Boys Are Back|url=https://jazztimes.com/features/gordon-goodwin-the-phat-boys-are-back/|website=JazzTimes|accessdate=22 June 2017|date=1 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has appeared as a session musician on albums by [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]], [[Sheila E.]], [[Miki Howard]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Rodney Friend]], [[Diane Schuur]], and [[Van Dyke Parks]].&lt;ref name="Collar" /&gt; He has recorded with [[Keiko Matsui]], [[3rd Force]], [[David Benoit (musician)|David Benoit]], [[Cheryl Bentyne]], and [[Lorraine Feather]] and had a guitar solo as a separate track on the album ''[[Hold an Old Friend's Hand]]'' by [[Tiffany Darwish|Tiffany]].

Geissman reunited with Mangione in 2000 when they recorded the album ''Everything for Love'' ([[Chesky Records|Chesky]]).&lt;ref name="Collar" /&gt; Geissman's early musical influences came full circle in 2003 when he played [[Dobro]] on [[Ringo Starr]]'s ''Ringorama'' album. In 2006, he released his thirteenth album as a leader, ''Say That!'', on his own label, Futurism Records. A throwback to the jazz that first influenced him, he has described the sound of this album as "[[Wes Montgomery]] meets [[Horace Silver]] meets [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]]." In ''All About Jazz'', John Kelman said,

: It's a shame that the words 'smooth jazz' have become an oxymoron. ''Say That!'', with its relaxed pace and easy-on-the-ears approach, is as smooth as it gets. But smooth jazz it ain't. Geissman's clear roots in the jazz mainstream, and a less-is-more style that reveals greater depth, makes ''Say That!'' a welcome return to the fold for a guitarist who's always deserved more street cred than he's received.

== Television ==
Geissman and Mangione appeared on many televisions shows, including ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''Dinah Shore'', ''Merv Griffin'', ''Phil Donahue'', ''The Midnight Special'', ''Don Kirshner's Rock Concert'' and ''Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve''. Geissman's other albums with Mangione include ''Children of Sanchez'' (1978), ''Live at the Hollywood Bowl'' (1979), and ''Fun and Games'' (1980).

Geissman's playing has been heard on numerous television series, including ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', [[Family Affair (2002 TV series)|''Family Affair'']], ''[[Boy Meets World]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'' and ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]''. He can be heard playing the [[Django Reinhardt|Djangoesque]] acoustic guitar on the theme for the television series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', starring [[Tony Shalhoub]]. Nominated for a 2001 Emmy for co-writing the song "No Puedo Olvidar" for the daytime drama ''Passions'', he received an Emmy nomination in 2004 for another ''Passions'' song, "Momma, Gotta Let Her Go". In 2003, he was nominated for an Annie award for producing [[Van Dyke Parks]]' songs for [[HBO]]'s ''Harold and the Purple Crayon''. He has written additional music for films and television movies, including ''The Ponder Heart'' (2001), ''Call Me Claus'' (2001), ''Monday Night Mayhem'' (2002), ''Die, Mommie, Die!'' (2003) and ''The Mojo Cafe'' (2004). Dennis C. Brown and Geissman collaborated on the underscore for the hit CBS-TV sitcom ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''. The show's theme, co-written by Geissman, was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2004.

== Books ==
Apart from his musical career, Geissman has written three books for ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine and [[EC Comics]]: ''Collectibly Mad'' (Kitchen Sink Press, 1995); ''Tales of Terror! The EC Comics Companion'', co-authored with [[Fred von Bernewitz]] (Fantagraphics, 2000); and ''Foul Play! The Art and Artists of the Notorious 1950s E.C. Comics!'' (HarperDesign, 2005). He has also compiled and/or written annotations for ten other ''Mad''-related books, and he appears in Chip Selby's documentary, ''Tales from the Crypt: From Comic Books to Television'' (2004). In 2011, Geissman teamed with [[Russ Cochran]] to launch a publishing company, GC Press, to continue the hardcover [[EC Archives]] series originally published by Gemstone.

'''Henriette Davidson Avram''' (October 7, 1919 – April 22, 2006) was a [[computer programmer]] and [[systems analyst]] who developed the [[MARC standards|MARC format]] (Machine Readable Cataloging), the international [[data (computing)|data]] [[standardization|standard]] for [[bibliographic]] and holdings information in [[libraries]]. Avram's development of the MARC format in the late 1960s and early 1970s at the [[Library of Congress]] had a revolutionizing effect on the practice of [[librarianship]], making possible the [[automation]] of many library functions and the sharing of bibliographic information electronically between libraries using pre-existing [[library catalog|cataloging]] standards.&lt;ref name=Schudel/&gt;

==Early years==
Henriette Regina Davidson was born in [[Manhattan]] on October 7, 1919,&lt;ref name=ObituaryNYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fox|first1=Margalit|title=Henriette D. Avram, Modernizer of Libraries, Dies at 86|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/us/03avram.html?ex=1304308800&amp;en=60308f72d854136a&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0|accessdate=14 October 2014|work=The New York Times|date=May 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a father who was a watch material distributor and a mother who was a ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia Ledger]]'' reporter. Although she never intended to become a librarian, Henriette did spend many Saturdays of her childhood reading in neighborhood stores, which, at that time, housed mini-public libraries.&lt;ref name=Pattie&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pattie|first1=Ling-yuh W. (Miko)|title=Henriette Davidson Avram, the Great Legacy|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|date=11 May 1998|volume=25|issue=2–3|pages=67–81|doi=10.1300/J104v25n02_05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henriette Davidson dreamed of finding a cure for [[cancer]], which was prevalent in her family. She therefore majored in [[pre-medicine]] at [[Hunter College]].&lt;ref name=ObituaryNYT/&gt; In 1941, she married [[Herbert Avram|Herbert Mois Avram]],&lt;ref name=ObituaryNYT/&gt; who was enlisted in the Navy. By the end of [[World War II]], Herbert Avram was a decorated Lieutenant Commander who had been assigned to both the Atlantic and Pacific Theatres.

The Avrams had three children: Marcie, Lloyd, and Jay, and maintained residence in New York until 1951, when Herbert Avram took a job with the [[National Security Agency]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=ObituaryNYT/&gt; Herbert Avram would also work for the [[CIA]], eventually becoming a pioneer in the digital [[court reporting]] industry, which developed [[Closed Captions]] for television.&lt;ref name=Herbert&gt;{{cite news|work=Washington Post.|title=Obituary: Herbert M. Avram.|date=January 22, 2006|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/washingtonpost/obituary.aspx?pid=16407287#fbLoggedOut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career beginnings ==
The couple moved first to [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], and later to [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]]. Once settled in Virginia, Avram left her life of [[homemaking]] behind.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rather|first1=Lucia J.|last2=Wiggins|first2=Beacher|title=MARC her Words: An Interview with Henriette Avram|journal=American Libraries|date=October 1989|volume=20|issue=9|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/15011173/marc-her-words-interview-henriette-avram|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|860}} She began studying mathematics at [[George Washington University]],&lt;ref name=ObituaryNYT/&gt; and joined the NSA herself in 1952. Working with the [[IBM 701]], she soon became one of the first computer programmers. Reminiscing about her time with the NSA, Avram said, "Learning programming in those days was ... a bootstrap operation. You were on your own with far less than perfect tools to learn from ... and the numbers of people that made it through to become programmers were few indeed. It was an exciting time."&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt;{{rp|860}}

In the early sixties she moved to the private sector, working first with the American Research Bureau and later for a software company, Datatrol Corporation.&lt;ref name=ObituaryNYT/&gt; Both jobs consisted of systems analysis and programming, but it was at Datatrol that Avram had her first professional experience with libraries. Asked to design a computer science library, she quickly read several library science text books in order to learn the appropriate jargon. She also hired a librarian to assist her in the design process. It was through this project that Avram was introduced to the [[Library of Congress]] Card Division Service. She also did consulting work with [[Frederick Kilgour]], father of the [[Online Computer Library Center]], on OCLC's first attempt at computerizing [[bibliographic]] information.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt;{{rp|860}}&lt;ref name=Intner&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Intner|first1=Sheila S.|title=The Passing of an Era|journal=Technicalities|date=March 2007|volume=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1965, Avram heard of an opening at the Library of Congress, and was hired as a systems analyst in the Office of the Information Systems Specialist.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|860}}

== Library of Congress ==
Avram, considered a "librarian by achievement" by the American Library Association (ALA), owed much to the Library of Congress, about which she said, "... when I speak of and refer to it as 'the Great Library,' I do so with sincerity and appreciation for everything that I learned within those walls."&lt;ref name=Pattie/&gt;{{rp|73}}&lt;ref name=AmericanLibraries&gt;{{cite journal|title=They Won! and Did It ALA's Way|journal=American Libraries|date=September 1997|volume=28|issue=8|page=70|url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-19926707/they-won-and-did-it-ala-s-way|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avram was often noted for her petite stature, New York accent, and indefatigable drive.&lt;ref name=Pattie/&gt;{{rp|67}} &lt;ref name=ReferenceB&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rather|first1=Lucia J.|last2=Wiggins|first2=Beacher|title=Henriette D. Avram: Close-Up on the Career of a Towering Figure in Library Automation and Bibliographic Control|journal=American Libraries|date=October 1989|volume=20|issue=9|pages=855–859|url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-7998511/henriette-d-avram-close-up-on-the-career-of-a-towering|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|856}} &lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt;{{rp|861}} She was also an adept leader. "She was able to foster a cooperative spirit among the computer specialists and librarians on her staff. In her typical fashion, she stepped into the world of libraries and learned libraries' problems, adopting them as her own."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|856}}

Her first assignment at the Library of Congress (LC) was to analyze cataloging data for computer processing. In keeping with her training at NSA, where she learned "the prime necessity of thoroughly understanding the subject before tackling the computer solution," Avram, along with two librarians, began this process by examining the information contained in a catalog record.&lt;ref name=Pattie/&gt;{{rp|72}}

A separate mathematical [[algorithm]] would be needed for each piece of information, and there were millions of items in the catalog, in hundreds of different languages. She also studied ALA rules and LC filing rules to learn all that she could about bibliographic control. When Avram had thoroughly examined every aspect of the bibliographic record, "she translated what she learned into a set of fields ... bearing a name (the tags), handling instructions (the indicators), and parts (the subfields)."&lt;ref name=Intner/&gt;

Avram's title at LC changed to Assistant Coordinator of Information Systems in 1967. In this position, she continued to direct the [[MARC standards|MARC]] Pilot Project, which concluded in June 1968; she directed the MARC Distribution Service, which began in March 1969; and she began the RECON Pilot Project, which was never completed. The RECON Project was a plan to convert retrospective materials to MARC format. Because this project was not embraced by LC, retrospective conversion has taken place across the country, rather than as a nationwide coordinated effort. Avram said, "This failure has severely impacted all libraries."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|861}} She also called lack of support for RECON the "single most disappointing experience" of her career.&lt;ref name=Pattie/&gt;{{rp|74}}

Avram became a part of the development of the International Standard for Bibliographic Description for Monograph Publications (ISBD(M)) when she attended an International Meeting of Cataloguing Experts sponsored by the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions|International Federation of Library Association]] (IFLA) in 1969. A year later, Avram became Chief of MARC Development Office at LC. She continued to head the MARC and RECON projects, but was also responsible for all of the automation involved with LC's processing activities. Her duties further expanded when she became the Director of the Network Development Office in 1976. She was then in charge of coordinating library networking and bibliographic resources and standards at both the national and international levels. In addition, she became chair of the LC Network Advisory Committee, a position which she held for over a decade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|857}} At this time she was also chair of the IFLA Working Group on Content Designators, which used the ISBD to develop the international version of MARC format known as UNIMARC.

By 1980 Avram was directing a staff of seven hundred in the Processing Department of LC. In her position as the first Director for Processing Systems, Networks and Automation Planning, she was responsible for networking, automation activities, and bibliographic products and services. When Avram became the Assistant Librarian for Processing Services three years later, her staff doubled. She was now in charge of [[cataloging]], acquisitions, overseas operations, and development of networking and automation planning. This position lasted for six years. In speaking of her decision to remain with LC, despite other, more lucrative opportunities, Avram said, "I stayed because I loved the place, the people, and the challenge."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|861}} When she retired from LC in 1992, Avram was the Associate Librarian for Collections Services. Her staff of seventeen hundred was responsible for acquisitions, cataloging, preservation, collection development, overseas operations, network and automation planning, and processing and servicing special format materials.&lt;ref name=Schudel&gt;{{cite news|last=Schudel|first=Matt|title=Henriette D. Avram; Transformed Libraries|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/27/AR2006042702105.html|accessdate=16 March 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=April 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MARC ==
MARC, [[Machine Readable Cataloging|MAchine-Readable Cataloging]], is the method by which paper-and-ink card catalogs were converted to computer catalogs. This automated library systems, in turn greatly enhancing the feasibility of [[Interlibrary loan|interlibrary lending]] and paving the way for networking capabilities.&lt;ref name=Pattie/&gt;{{rp|69}} Avram was a key figure in the revolution of [[librarian]]ship into [[information science]].&lt;ref name=InCite2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Australian Library and Information Association|title=She made her MARC|journal=InCite|date=2006|volume=27|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MARC, in her words, is "an assemblage of formats, publications, procedures, people, standards, systems, equipment, etc., that has evolved over the years stimulating the development of library automation and information networks ... nationally and internationally."&lt;ref name=Pattie/&gt;{{rp|73–74}} MARC has had many incarnations through the years, from the initial Planning Memorandum Number Three, which resulted from that first catalog card analysis at LC, to MARC 1 (as the format was subsequently named after the MARC Pilot System, November 1966-October 1967),&lt;ref name=MARC&gt;{{Cite book|title = The MARC pilot project: final report on a project sponsored by the Council on Library Resources, inc.|last = Avram|first = Henriette|publisher = Library of Congress|year = 1968|isbn = |location = Washington, DC|oclc = 3690|page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually to MARC 21, the format that is used today. Avram is the author of the book, ''MARC, its history and implications'', published by the [[Library of Congress]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=Avram&gt;{{cite book|last=Avram|first=Henriette D.|title=MARC, its history and implications|year=1975|publisher=Library of Congress|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-8444-0176-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to ensure that MARC would be adopted nationwide, she worked with the [[American Library Association]] and the [[American National Standards Institute]] to make it a national standard.&lt;ref name=Pattie/&gt;{{rp|69–70}} Not content with earning the national standard in 1971, Avram continued lobbying until MARC became an [[International Organization for Standardization]] standard in 1973. Largely due to her efforts, MARC is now used as the basis for library automation and bibliographic communication throughout the world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|857}} Avram was also one of the original planners of the Linked Systems Project. In this role, she was "tireless in spreading the gospel of using international standards to link databases housed on disparate computer systems."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|859}} Though she never intended to be a librarian, Avram became a "towering figure in library automation and bibliographic control."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{rp|855}}

After retirement, Avram and her husband moved to [[California, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|861}} The couple remained active through [[St. Mary's College of Maryland|St. Mary's College]], where Henriette often arranged for Library of Congress officials to be guest speakers.

After Herbert, her husband of sixty-four years, died in their home on January 15, 2006,&lt;ref name=Herbert/&gt; Henriette relocated to Florida. She died of cancer at Miami's Baptist Hospital on April 22, just three months after the death of her husband. She was 86 years old.&lt;ref name=ObituaryNYT/&gt; Avram once said,

{{quote|I'd like to be remembered as a good manager, as having done something that was significant in this world, of service to others.&lt;ref name=AmericanLibraries/&gt;}}

Her energetic, diplomatic leadership and remarkable contribution to automation and bibliographic control are proof that she achieved this goal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|861}}

Though proud of her accomplishments, Avram's famous drive never quit. "We must not sit back and be satisfied, though," she said, "there is much more to do."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|860}}

'''''How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life''''' is a [[young adult fiction|young adult novel]] by Kaavya Viswanathan, who wrote it just after she graduated from high school. Its 2006 debut was highly publicized while she was enrolled at [[Harvard University]], but the book was withdrawn after it was discovered that portions had been [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] from several sources, including the works of  [[Salman Rushdie]] and [[Meg Cabot]].&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-23"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=512948 |title=Student’s Novel Faces Plagiarism Controversy |first=David |last=Zhou |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |publisher=TheCrimson.com |date=April 23, 2006 |accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-05-02 Similar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=513213 |title=''Opal'' Similar to More Books |first=David |last=Zhou |author2=Paras D.

While attending [[Bergen County Academies]], Viswanathan showed her writing &amp;ndash; including a several-hundred-page novel on Irish history she had already completed &amp;ndash; to Katherine Cohen of [[IvyWise]], a private college admissions consultancy which Viswanathan's parents had hired to help with their daughter's application process.&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-06"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/06/books/06opal.html |title=A 'How to Get Into College by Really, Really Trying' Novel |first=Dinitia |last=Smith |work=The New York Times |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=April 6, 2006 |accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Cohen, Viswanathan was signed by the [[William Morris Agency]] under senior agent and William Morris partner Jennifer Rudolph Walsh&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-06"/&gt; and referred to [[book packaging]] company 17th Street Productions (now called [[Alloy Entertainment]]),&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-27 Read"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/27/books/27author.html?ex=1303790400&amp;en=48e05549837c1308&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss |title=Novelist Says She Read Copied Books Several Times |first=Dinitia |last=Smith |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company|date=April 27, 2006 |accessdate=June 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-4-27 Withdraw"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/27/books/27cnd-author.html |title=Publisher Withdraws ''How Opal Mehta Got Kissed'' |first=Motoko |last= Rich |author2=Dinitia Smith |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company|date=April 27, 2006 |accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a media firm responsible for packaging the ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'' and ''[[The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants]]'' book series, among others.&lt;ref name="PW 2008-06-26"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6572459.html|title=Moving On Up: ''Pretty Little Liars''|last=Maughan|first=Shannon|date=June 26, 2008|publisher=PublishersWeekly.com|accessdate=June 4, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131145339/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6572459.html |archivedate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of an outline and four chapters of the novel that would become ''Opal Mehta'', Viswanathan eventually signed a two-book deal with [[Little, Brown and Company]]&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-06"/&gt; for an advance originally reported to be $500,000.&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-25"/&gt; She began writing the book the summer before college, and finished it during her freshman year at [[Harvard College]], while taking a full course load.&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-06"/&gt; ''Opal Mehta'' was published on April 4, 2006,&lt;ref name="Amazon Opal Mehta"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316059889/ |title=''How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life'' (Hardcover): Reviews and Product Details |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=May 31, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Viswanathan was profiled by ''[[The New York Times]]'' on April 6, 2006.&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-06"/&gt;

''Opal Mehta'' centers on an academically oriented Indian-American girl who, after being told by a Harvard College admissions officer that she is not well-rounded, doggedly works to become a typical American teen: ultrasocial, shopping- and boy-driven, and carelessly hip.&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-06"/&gt; With ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' calling the book "''[[Legally Blonde]]'' in reverse," Viswanathan stated that her own college prep experience had inspired the novel: "I was surrounded by the stereotype of high-pressure Asian and Indian families trying to get their children into Ivy League schools."&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-06"/&gt; When asked about her influences in an interview given to ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' of [[Newark, New Jersey]] (before any allegations of plagiarism had surfaced), Viswanathan responded that "nothing I read gave me the inspiration" to write the novel.&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-05-01"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/01/business/media/01link.html?_r=1 |title=In Internet Age, Writers Face Frontier Justice |first=Tom |last=Zeller Jr. |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=May 1, 2006 |accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-26"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=513041 |title=Publisher Rejects Soph's Apology |last=Zhou |first=David |work=The Harvard Crimson |publisher=TheCrimson.com |date=April 26, 2006 |accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rediff 2006-04-26"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/news/2006/apr/26ajp.htm|title=More trouble awaits Indian writer|last=Pais|first=Arthur J.|date=April 26, 2006|publisher=In.Rediff.com|accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Pietsch later told ''The New York Times'' that Viswanathan’s advance for her two-book deal was less than the previously publicized amount of $500,000, and that it was split between the author and [[Alloy Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-27"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=513112 |title=College Looking Into Plagiarism |first=David |last=Zhou |work=The Harvard Crimson |publisher=TheCrimson.com |date=April 27, 2006 |accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alloy President [[Leslie Morgenstein]] asserted that while the firm helped Viswanathan "conceptualize and plot the book,"&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-27"/&gt; it did not help with the actual writing.&lt;ref name="Boston 2006-04-26"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/04/26/harvard_authors_apology_not_accepted/|title=Harvard author's apology not accepted|last=Mehegan|first=David|date=April 26, 2006|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Alloy was no longer involved once the book was sold to Little, Brown,&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-27 Read"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-4-27 Withdraw"/&gt; the company shares the [[copyright]] with Viswanathan.&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boston 2006-04-26"/&gt; Her agent Walsh told ''The New York Times'' that the plot and writing of ''Opal Mehta'' had been "1,000 percent" Viswanathan's.&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-27 Read"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-4-27 Withdraw"/&gt; The novel was edited by Asya Muchnick at Little, Brown,&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-27 Read"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-4-27 Withdraw"/&gt; and the movie rights to the book were sold to [[DreamWorks SKG]] in February 2006.&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-26"/&gt;

==Plagiarism==

===Megan McCafferty===
On April 23, 2006, ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' reported that several portions of ''Opal Mehta'' appeared to have been plagiarized from [[Megan McCafferty]]'s first two "[[Jessica Darling]]" novels, ''Sloppy Firsts'' (2001) and ''Second Helpings'' (2003), noting over a dozen similar passages.&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-26"/&gt; At the time, Viswanathan's novel had reached 32nd on ''The New York Times''{{'s}} [[hardcover]] fiction bestseller list.&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-23"/&gt; McCafferty's third Jessica Darling novel, ''Charmed Thirds'', had just been released a week after ''Opal Mehta'', and was No. 19 on the same list.&lt;ref name="Boston 2006-04-26"/&gt;

McCafferty stated that she had learned about Viswanathan's plagiarism through a fan's e-mail on April 11, 2006,&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-23"/&gt; the same day ''Charmed Thirds'' was released&lt;ref name="Amazon Thirds"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400080428/ |title=''Charmed Thirds'' (Hardcover): Reviews and Product Details |publisher=Amazon.com |date=April 11, 2006 |accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly two weeks before the story went public.&lt;ref name="GMNews 2006-05-18"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulletin.gmnews.com/news/2006-05-18/Front_Page/006.html |title=Author McCafferty talks shop with Brick's Lit Chicks |first=Colleen |last=Lutolf |work=Brick Township Bulletin |publisher=BulletinGMNews.com |date=May 18, 2006 |accessdate=July 11, 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711102514/http://bulletin.gmnews.com/news/2006-05-18/Front_Page/006.html |archivedate=July 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to McCafferty, the email's subject read: "'Flattery or a case for litigation.' I thought, oh my God, somebody's suing me."&lt;ref name="GMNews 2006-05-18"/&gt; Prompted by the email's allegations, McCafferty looked at ''Opal Mehta'' and later said that reading Viswanathan's book was like "recognizing your own child's face. My own words were just leaping out at me page after page after page."&lt;ref name="GMNews 2006-05-18"/&gt; Contacted by the ''Crimson'' the day before they broke the story, McCafferty responded via email, “I’m already aware of this situation, and so is my publisher ... After reading the book in question, and finding passages, characters, and plot points in common, I do hope this can be resolved in a manner that is fair to all of the parties involved.”&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-23"/&gt;

On April 24, 2006, Little, Brown issued a statement from Viswanathan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When I was in high school, I read and loved two wonderful novels by Megan McCafferty,'' Sloppy Firsts '' and '' Second Helpings, '' which spoke to me in a way few other books did. Recently, I was very surprised and upset to learn that there are similarities between some passages in my novel ... and passages in these books ... While the central stories of my book and hers are completely different, I wasn't aware of how much I may have internalized Ms. McCafferty's words. I am a huge fan of her work and can honestly say that any phrasing similarities between her works and mine were completely unintentional and unconscious. My publisher and I plan to revise my novel for future printings to eliminate any inappropriate similarities ... I sincerely apologize to Megan McCafferty and to any who feel they have been misled by these unintentional errors on my part."&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crimson 2009-04-24"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=512999 |title=Kaavya Speaks: 'I Sincerely Apologize' |author=Crimson Staff |work=The Harvard Crimson |publisher=TheCrimson.com |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC 2006-04-26"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2006/04/26/1623754.htm|title=Teen author accused of 'literary identity theft'|author=[[Reuters]]|date=April 26, 2006|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Viswanathan's agent Walsh stated, "Knowing what a fine person Kaavya is, I believe any similarities were unintentional. Teenagers tend to adopt each other's language."&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-25"/&gt; The day after Viswanathan's admission, Steve Ross of [[Crown Publishing Group]] &amp;ndash; a [[subsidiary]] of [[Random House]] and the publisher of ''Sloppy Firsts'' and ''Second Helpings'' &amp;ndash; issued a statement in response:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We find both the responses of Little Brown and their author Kaavya Viswanathan deeply troubling and disingenuous. Ms. Viswanathan's claim that similarities in her phrasing were 'unconscious' or 'unintentional' is suspect. We have documented more than forty passages from Kaavya Viswanathan's recent publication ''How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life'' that contain identical language and/or common scene or dialogue structure from Megan McCafferty's first two books, ''Sloppy Firsts'' and ''Second Helpings''. This extensive taking from Ms. McCafferty's books is nothing less than an act of literary identity theft ... Based on the scope and character of the similarities, it is inconceivable that this was a display of youthful innocence or an unconscious or unintentional act."&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rediff 2006-04-26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boston 2006-04-26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC 2006-04-26"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ross said later that "We all felt it was important that we come to [McCafferty's] defense and make clear that we support our author. The notion that this was accidental stretches credibility to the breaking point."&lt;ref name="Boston 2006-04-26"/&gt; McCafferty's agent Joanna Pulcini also identified 45 "strikingly similar" passages, stating via email that "Many include identical phrasing, establish primary characters, and contain shared plot developments ... It is understandably difficult for us to accept that Ms. Viswanathan’s plagiarism was ‘unintentional and unconscious,’ as she has claimed."&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-26"/&gt; Ross added that at that time, McCafferty was "devastated" by the plagiarism, feeling "like something fundamental was taken" and "not sleeping, not eating."&lt;ref name="Boston 2006-04-26"/&gt;

In an April 26, 2006 interview with ''The New York Times'', Viswanathan suggested that some of the plagiarism may have happened because she read both of McCafferty's books multiple times and has a [[eidetic memory|photographic memory]].&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-27 Read"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-4-27 Withdraw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-27"/&gt; "I remember by reading," she said.

"I was stunned to find two dozen instances of lifting from ''Born Confused'' in the ''Opal Mehta'' book ... I also drew largely from autobiography to tell the story of my 17-year-old Indian American Jersey girl, Dimple Lala. And I hadn't read any books I could recall with a [[South Asia]]n American teen protagonist at that point (I wrote ''Born Confused'' in 2000/2001 and it launched in 2002). To the best of my knowledge ''Born Confused'' was the first book with a US female teen [[desi]] heroine; that was one of the reasons my publisher wanted it, and it is certainly one of the reasons I wrote it ... And so I was extremely surprised to find that the majority, though not all, of the passages in ''Opal Mehta'' taken from ''Born Confused'' are those dealing with descriptions of various aspects of South Asian culture (food, dress, locale, even memories of India, etc.) and the way that culture is expressed in America; essentially every scene of ''Opal Mehta'' that deals with any aspect of South Asian culture in more than passing detail has lifted something from ''Born Confused''. One would think that these kinds of cultural details at least could have been drawn from Ms. Viswanathan's personal experience, given our similar cultural backgrounds (and the similar cultural backgrounds and ages of our protagonists)."&lt;ref name="DesiClub 2006"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An excerpt of ''Born Confused'' had appeared in ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine in 2002.&lt;ref name="DesiClub 2006"/&gt; Hidier was subsequently contacted by Viswanathan's future book packager 17th Street/Alloy, but she declined their offer to collaborate with her on an "Indian-American teen story."&lt;ref name="DesiClub 2006"/&gt; Hidier noted in 2006 that "several parts of this excerpt &amp;ndash; including the opening and closing &amp;ndash; are present and strongly echoed in the ''Opal Mehta'' book."&lt;ref name="DesiClub 2006"/&gt; She added that ''Born Confused'' contained many specific details from her own life which had been recycled by Viswanathan:&lt;ref name="DesiClub 2006"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It was a surreal experience for me, looking at these and the other parallel parts side by side. The feeling was almost as if someone had broken into your home &amp;ndash; and in some ways this is what literally had happened, considering so much of ''Born Confused'' is drawn from my life (and home): The alcohol cabinet in my non-drinking household in small town [[Massachusetts]] was now in Opal's, the details of my family's two dinnertimes because of all the years of working late into the night by my father, too; my mother's food, from her mother's recipes, transplanted to Opal's table, her slinky black outfit too; my ecstatic and eye-opening discovery of [[Jackson Heights, Queens]] during an enthralled and emotional day there many years ago, suddenly turned to [[Edison, New Jersey]] ... Did [Viswanathan and/or Alloy] think you could just substitute one kind of Indian for another? A friend brought my attention to a couple observant bloggers who seemed to have caught on early to this grand error, commenting on how jarring it was to see a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]/[[Marathi people|Marathi]] meal on a South Indian table ... and that some of the memories of India hearken back to a much older India in the ''Opal Mehta'' book (which makes sense considering the many years that separate Ms. Viswanathan and myself) &amp;ndash; details that may have escaped a person not familiar with the culture."&lt;ref name="DesiClub 2006"/&gt;

Inside, padded carefully between layers of tissue, was an unbelievably resounding salvar khamees, one of those Indian outfits consisting of loose-fitting pants with a long top and scarf, or dupatta. The deep crimson fabric screamed sanguinely open. A river of nearly neon gold dye wound noisily through its length. The salvar was ornately embroidered with gold and silver and garnet beads and little bells that made a racket even as I lifted it out of the box. All in all it was, in fact, so loud I could hear it. Heavy, too — funny how all those little driblets could add up."&lt;ref name="HI 2006-05-03"/&gt;
|valign=top|page 125-126: "I looked at the multicolored swirl-patterned box hesitantly. In my past experience, gifts from Edison rarely boded well. And when I tore apart the layers of carefully packed tissue paper, I found an elaborate salwar kameez — loose pants, a long tunic-style top, and a trailing scarf, or dupatta. The salwar was a startling peacock-green, and embroidered so ornately with gold and silver threads and glittering beads that it made my eyes hurt. When I lifted it up, the room resounded to the tinkle of thousands of tiny golden bells. It was surprisingly heavy — all that jigna really added up — and it was the last thing in the world I ever wanted to wear."&lt;ref name="HI 2006-05-03"/&gt;

|valign=top|page 92-93: "All day the house had smelled of spices, and now before our eyes lay the resulting combustion of all that kitchen chemistry. The feast my mother had conjured up was extravagant, and I realized how hungry I was; I wasn’t a big fan of Indian food, at least not on a daily basis, but today the sight of it was pure poetry ... Brown sugar roti and cloud-puff puris just itching to be popped. Coconut rice fluffed up over the silver pot like a sweet-smelling pillow. Samosas transparent, peas bundling just below the surface. Spinach with nymph-finger cloves of garlic that sank like butter on the tongue. A vat of cucumber raita, the two-percent yogurt thickened with sour cream (which my mom added when we had guests, though she denied it when asked; I’d seen the empty carton, not a kitten lick left). And the centerpiece: a deep serving dish of lamb curry, the pieces melting tenderly off the bone."&lt;ref name="HI 2006-05-03"/&gt;
|valign=top|page 130: "This year, fortunately, there wasn’t an egg in sight. Instead, the house had smelled of spices all day, and when we sat down at the dining room table, I nearly combusted at the sight of the extravagant feast my mom had conjured up. Usually I wasn’t a big fan of Indian food, but today I was suddenly starving. The table creaked with the weight of crisp, brown rotis and feather-light, puffy puris. A basket of my favorite kheema naan sat beside the clouds of cashew and sultana-studded coconut rice in an enormous pot. There was plump okra fried in oil and garlic till it melted like butter on the tongue, aloo curry studded with peppercorns and glistening chopped chilis, and a crock of raita, a cool, delicious mixture of yogurt and sour cream, bursting with finely chopped onions and cucumbers. The centerpiece was a deep dish of mutton curry, the meat (my mom only used halal bought from an Arab butcher in Edison) already falling off the bone."&lt;ref name="HI 2006-05-03"/&gt;

|valign=top|page 13: "India. I had few memories of the place, but the ones I held were dream clear: Bathing in a bucket as a little girl. The unnerving richness of buffalo milk drunk from a pewter cup. My Dadaji pouring tea into a saucer so it would cool faster, sipping from the edge of the thin dish, never spilling a drop. A whole host of kitchen gods (looking so at home in the undishwashed unmicrowaved room). Meera Maasi crouching on the floor to sift the stones from rice. Cows huddled in the middle of the vegetable market, sparrows nesting on their backs. Hibiscus so brilliant they look like they’d caught fire. Children with red hair living in tires. A perpetual squint against sun and dust. The most delicious orange soda I’ve ever drunk — the cap-split hiss, and then the bubbling jetstream down a parched throat."&lt;ref name="HI 2006-05-03"/&gt;
|valign=top|page 230-231: "I had only a few memories of India; the last time my family visited was six years ago, when I was in the sixth grade….Some impressions stood out sharply in my mind, still as clear as freshly developed Polaroids. I remembered the cold, creamy taste of fresh buffalo milk, Babaji pouring Ovaltine from one tin cup to another until froth bubbled thickly on the surface and it was cool enough to drink. I remembered shooting rockets made of coconut leaves off the rooftop terrace, and watching the beady-eyed green-and-yellow lizards that scuttled over the putty-colored walls after a hard rain. I remembered cold baths from a bucket with a plastic dipper, and sweet, oily badam halva from the nearby Chola hotel. Sometimes I still read the old Enid Blyton books, which were only available in countries of the former British empire. Most of all, I could close my eyes and return to the smells of sun and dust and refuse, mixed with sharp chilis, my grandmother’s soft rose talcum powder, and the heady, sweet scent of blossoming hibiscus."&lt;ref name="HI 2006-05-03"/&gt;

==Fallout and reaction==
In her initial statement on April 24, 2006, Viswanathan had stated that she and the publisher would be revising the novel for future printings "to eliminate any inappropriate similarities."&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-05-02 Cancel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crimson 2009-04-24"/&gt; The same day, Michael Pietsch of Little, Brown stated, “Kaavya Viswanathan is a decent, serious, and incredibly hard-working writer and student, and I am confident that we will learn that any similarities in phrasings were unintentional."&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-26"/&gt; He subsequently noted that an acknowledgment to McCafferty would be added to future printings,&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-04-25"/&gt; an intention echoed by Viswanathan in her April 26, 2006 interview with Katie Couric on ''The Today Show''.&lt;ref name="Today trans 2006-04-26"/&gt; Little, Brown recalled all copies of ''Opal Mehta'' on April 27, 2006.&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-05-02 Cancel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-4-27 Withdraw"/&gt; The next day, [[edition (book)|first edition]] copies of the novel were priced at $80 on [[eBay]].&lt;ref name="NYT 2006-05-01"/&gt; On May 2, 2006, after further allegations of plagiarism had come to light, Little, Brown released a statement from Pietsch saying, "Little, Brown and Company will not be publishing a revised edition of ''How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life'' by Kaavya Viswanathan, nor will we publish the second book under contract."&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-05-02 Cancel"/&gt; [[DreamWorks]] had already halted development of the film adaptation in late April 2006.&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-05-02 Similar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/04/29/calendar/et-ruttenside29 |title=Now ''Opal'' won't get a movie |first=Robin |last=Abcarian |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=LATimes.com |date=April 29, 2006 |accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard University said soon after controversy broke that it would not affect her academic standing there.&lt;ref name="Rediff 2006-04-26"/&gt; She graduated with honors in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyfamily-digital.com/nyfamily/200812/?pg=22 |title=Kaavya Emptor |first=Greg |last=Atwan |work=The Harvard |publisher=NYFamily-Digital.com (Volume 3, Number 1)|date=December 2008 – January 2009 |accessdate=October 14, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218202955/http://www.nyfamily-digital.com/nyfamily/200812/?pg=22 |archivedate=2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, 2006, McCafferty noted, "I had heard so much about her book and I had planned on reading it [before the allegations surfaced] ... It was sad and it was a shock that it could happen on such a big scale ... This was a big book that was getting so much attention and publicity. It is the most surreal thing that's ever happened to me."&lt;ref name="GMNews 2006-05-18"/&gt; Alerted to the situation two weeks before ''The Harvard Crimson'' picked up the story, she stated that "The media broke it and I was sick to my stomach ... People don't know how hard it was to have somebody else take that from me and try and profit. As someone [who has been] writing my entire life, to build my career, it almost made me lose faith in the publishing industry."&lt;ref name="GMNews 2006-05-18"/&gt; Though Alloy Entertainment had previously stated that it helped Viswanathan conceptualize the book but did not help with the actual writing,&lt;ref name="Crimson 2006-04-27"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boston 2006-04-26"/&gt; McCafferty also raised the issue of their possible culpability in the scandal.&lt;ref name="GMNews 2006-05-18"/&gt; As book packagers sometimes use their own staff or hire freelance writers to [[ghostwriter|ghostwrite]] manuscripts for publishers, McCafferty asked, "Was it the book packagers who really wrote the book and plagiarized my books or was it her?"&lt;ref name="GMNews 2006-05-18"/&gt;

Of Viswanathan being remembered for the scandal, McCafferty also said, "I wouldn't want to be defined by a mistake made in such a public way ... I hope she can move on from this. I hope that for both of us."&lt;ref name="GMNews 2006-05-18"/&gt; In addition, she noted that "Books for teens have taken a huge beating in the media" in the aftermath of the incident.&lt;ref name="GMNews 2006-05-18"/&gt; "These very elitist comments about 'how all books for teens are crap; so isn't this just crap stealing from crap'. My books are not crap."&lt;ref name="GMNews 2006-05-18"/&gt; McCafferty noted that she was insulted by an opinion letter published in ''The New York Times'' in which one writer wrote that teen books are "undemanding literature for undemanding readers."&lt;ref name="GMNews 2006-05-18"/&gt; "There's so much good writing for teenagers now," she said. "People make across the board judgments."&lt;ref name="GMNews 2006-05-18"/&gt;

The '''''Human Rights Record of the United States''''' (informally referred to as the "China Human Rights Report") is a publication on the annual human rights record in the [[United States of America]], published by the [[Information Office of the State Council]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The report was first issued in 1998 as a response to the [[United States]]' practice of criticizing China in its own annual ''[[Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]]'', which each of the Chinese reports cites in the first paragraph.

==Overview==
The ''Human Rights Record of the United States'' is published as a retort to U.S. criticism of China's human rights policies&lt;ref name="xinhuanet1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-04/10/c_13822179.htm |title=China hits back with report on U.S. human rights record |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131119194212/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-04/10/c_13822179.htm |archivedate=2013-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the annual ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices'', published by the [[State Department of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-04/10/c_13822287.htm |title=Full Text of Human Rights Record of the United States in 2010 |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029151313/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-04/10/c_13822287.htm |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese report states that the State Department reports are "full of distortions and accusations of the human rights situation in more than 190 countries and regions including China. However, the United States turned a blind eye to its own terrible human rights situation and seldom mentioned it." It says that the United States uses the human rights issues as "a political instrument to defame other nations' image and seek its own strategic interests." The report asserts ""[The U.S. State department] released the 'Country Reports on Human Rights Practices' year after year to accuse and blame other countries for their human rights practices. These moves fully expose the United States' hypocrisy by exercising [[double standard]]s on human rights and its malicious design to pursue hegemony under the pretext of human rights."&lt;ref name="xinhuanet1"/&gt;

The Report criticizes U.S. domestic social and economic issues, such as [[poverty]], [[crime]] and [[racism]]. Some of the data cited in the report is derived from official or authoritative sources; other sections are composed from a variety of material found online, some of which may be anecdotal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/11/china-us-human-rights-double-standards | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Tania | last=Branigan | title=China accuses US of human rights double standards | date=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the 2010 report, [[Fareed Zakaria]] wrote: "The report loses itself and takes away from the more serious charges it does make about [[Guantanamo Bay]] and [[CIA]] detention facilities. The Chinese government should get the report done by serious Chinese scholars, of whom there are many, rather than the propaganda department of its Communist Party, which seems to have written this one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/18/what-in-the-world-china-calls-out-the-u-s-on-human-rights/ | work=CNN | title=What in the world? China calls out the U.S. on human rights | date=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable reports==
===2003 report===
The ''Human Rights Record of the United States in 2003'', published on March 1, 2004, criticizes the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], saying it has "encroached upon rights and freedom of citizens, especially the people of [[ethnic]] minorities."&lt;ref&gt;I. "On Life, Freedom and Personal Safety" // [http://english.people.com.cn/200403/01/eng20040301_136190.shtml ''The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2003'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2011}} It also argues that the [[freedom of press]] has been neglected, citing examples such as the firing of [[Peter Arnett]] and limited access to ''[[al Jazeera]]'' television broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;II. On Political Rights and Freedom // [http://english.people.com.cn/200403/01/eng20040301_136190.shtml ''The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2003'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2011}} The report emphasized U.S. military actions abroad, including the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in March 2003, conducted without the approval of the [[United Nations]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The report concludes that the United States should "reflect on its erroneous position and behavior on human rights, and stop its unpopular interference with other countries' internal affairs under the pretext of promoting human rights".&lt;ref&gt;VI. "On Infringement upon Human Rights of Other Nations" // [http://english.people.com.cn/200403/01/eng20040301_136190.shtml ''The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2003'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2011}}

===2004 report===
The 2004 report stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2004 the atrocity of U.S. troops abusing Iraqi [[POW]]s exposed the dark side of human rights performance of the United States. The scandal shocked the public and was condemned by the international community. It is quite ironic that on Feb. 28 of this year, the State Department of the United States once again posed as 'the world human rights police' and released its 'Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2004'. As in previous years, the reports pointed fingers at human rights situation in more than 190 countries and regions (including China) but kept silent on the U.S. misdeeds in this field. Therefore, the world people have to probe the human rights record behind the Statue of Liberty in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction // [http://english.people.com.cn/200503/03/eng20050303_175406.html Full text of ''Human Rights Record of the United States in 2004'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===2014 report===

China published a report on the United States' human rights situation on June 26, 2015, hitting back at U.S. remarks about China.

The report, titled "The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2014," was released by the Information Office of the State Council, China's Cabinet, in response to "the 2014 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices" issued by the U.S. State Department on June 25 local time.

China's report states that the U.S. made comments on the human rights situations in many countries while showing not a bit of regret for or intention to improve its own terrible human rights record.

"The U.S., a self-proclaimed human rights defender, saw no improvements in its existent human rights issues, but reported numerous new problems," it says.

While its own human rights situation was increasingly grave, the U.S. violated human rights in other countries in a more brazen manner, and was given more "red cards" in the international human rights field, according to the report.

Ji Hong, a research fellow with Institute of American Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said America does not hold the moral high ground to tutor or judge others in that itself is also plagued by major human rights issues.
According to Ji, who took part in drafting the report, US racial problems even deteriorated during the Obama presidency. "In the past, there were only implicit discrimination against ethnic minorities, but recent cases such as Charleston shooting spree reflected a more flagrant bias."

VIOLENCE &amp; TORTURE

The U.S. was haunted by spreading guns, frequent occurrence of violent crimes, which threatened citizens' civil rights. The excessive use of force by police officers led to many deaths, sparking public outcry, the report says.

An unarmed 18-year-old African-American Michael Brown was shot dead by a white police officer named Darren Wilson in Ferguson, a town in Missouri. After the grand jury of both Missouri and New York decided to bring no charges against the white police officer, massive protests broke out in more than 170 cities nationwide, it cites cn.nytimes.com as saying.

"The U.S. used cruel tortures indiscriminately, notably those carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)," it says.

To acquire intelligence from suspects of terrorism and extremism, the CIA used brutal methods, such as sleep deprivation, waterboarding, long-term solitary confinement, slamming prisoners against the wall, lashing, death threat and even "rectal rehydration" or rectal feeding, according to the report.

DISCRIMINATION &amp; ABUSE

"The U.S. is a country with grim problems of racial discrimination, and institutional discrimination against ethnic minorities continued," according to the report.

Serious racial bias persisted in the police and justice systems. Minority groups and indigenous people are subject to unfairness in environment, election, health care, housing, education and other fields, it says.
In August 2014, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in its concluding observation on the periodic report of the U.S. on the latter's implementation of relevant convention, slammed the U.S. for violating the rights of ethnic minorities, indigenous people, immigrants and other minority groups.

It criticized the fact that members of racial and ethnic minorities continued to be disproportionately arrested, incarcerated and subjected to harsher sentences, according to the report.

"American women and children's rights were not fully protected," it says, adding that women were discriminated at workplaces, and domestic violence was prevalent.

The report quotes media reports as saying that 2.1 million American women on average were assaulted by men each year. Three females were murdered by their partner each day, and four females died each day as a result of abuse.

Also, "millions of American children were homeless." Three children died each day as a result of abuse. School violence and sex assaults were pervasive and gun shootings happened from time to time, it says.

MONEY POLITICS

"Money is a deciding factor in the U.S. politics, and the U.S. citizens' political rights were not properly protected," the report says.

Despite the highest midterm election spending in history, general election voter turnout for the 2014 midterms was the lowest since World War II, according to the report.

"Dark money" flowed into elections, and the voting rights of racial minorities and other groups were intentionally suppressed, it says, adding that a few interest groups with power were able to influence the government's decision-making.

The U.S. democratic system was experiencing a crisis of representation, it says.

"Ordinary citizens feel that their supposedly democratic government no longer truly reflects their interests and is under the control of a variety of shadowy elites," the report cites Foreign Affairs as saying.

INEQUALITY

"Although the U.S. is the most developed country in the world, it is hard for the economic and social rights of its citizens to be soundly ensured," the report says.

In the process of economic recovery, the income inequality continued to be enlarged, the basic living conditions for the homeless people deteriorated, the health care system operated terribly and the education rights of average citizens were violated, according to the report.

VIOLATIONS ELSEWHERE

In the field of international human rights, the U.S. has long refused to approve some core human rights conventions of the United Nations and voted against some important UN human rights resolutions, the report says.

National Security Agency and other intelligence-gathering apparatus of the U.S. for a long time have spied on world leaders and civilians, according to the report.

Moreover, the U.S. continued to go even further to violate human rights in other countries, including infringing the privacy of citizens of other countries with the overseas monitoring project, killing large numbers of innocent civilians of other countries in drone strikes, and raping and killing locals by U.S. soldiers garrisoned overseas, it says.

Friday's report was the 16th such annual report published by China in response to U.S. attacks.
Li Daojun, a professor with Law School of Shandong University, said the U.S. and China should expand mutual exchange and recognition on human rights causes. "The U.S. puts political rights above all else while China seeks to focus more on ensuring people's economic opportunities and development. In essence, it's the same because the two are interdependent."

The 2014 report stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
On June 25 local time, the State Department of the United States released its country reports on human rights practices once again, making comments on the human rights situations in many countries while showing not a bit of regret for or intention to improve its own terrible human rights record. Plenty of facts show that, in 2014, the U.S., a self-proclaimed human rights defender, saw no improvements in its existent human rights issues, but reported numerous new problems. While its own human rights situation was increasingly grave, the U.S. violated human rights in other countries in a more brazen manner, and was given more "red cards" in the international human rights field.

The U.S. was haunted by spreading guns, frequent occurrence of violent crimes, which threatened citizens' civil rights. Statistics showed that the use of firearms in the U.S. was behind 69 percent of murders, while for robberies, the figure was 40 percent, and for aggravated assaults, 21.6 percent (edition.cnn.com). The excessive use of force by police officers led to many deaths, sparking public outcry. An unarmed 18-year-old African-American Michael Brown was shot dead by a white police officer named Darren Wilson in Ferguson, a town in Missouri. After the grand jury of both Missouri and New York decided to bring no charges against the white police officer, massive protests broke out in more than 170 cities nationwide (cn.nytimes.com, November 25, 2014).

The U.S. used cruel tortures indiscriminately, notably those carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). To acquire intelligence from suspects of terrorism and extremism, the CIA used brutal methods, such as sleep deprivation, waterboarding, long-term solitary confinement, slamming prisoners against the wall, lashing, death threat and even "rectal rehydration" or rectal feeding. United Nations human rights convention institutions such as the UN Human Rights Committee and the Committee Against Torture had raised their concerns over issues in the U.S., including terrible detention conditions for convicts awaiting execution, abuse of brutal methods, secret detention, indefinite arbitrary detention, and illegal wire-tapping which infringed citizens' privacy. These institutions called on the U.S. to conduct swift, effective and fair investigations into all brutal behaviors and abuse of forces of the police force (www.un.org).

The U.S. is a country with grim problems of racial discrimination, and institutional discrimination against ethnic minorities continued. Serious racial bias persisted in the police and justice systems. Minority groups and indigenous people are subject to unfairness in environment, election, health care, housing, education and other fields. In August 2014, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in its concluding observation on the periodic report of the U.S. on the latter's implementation of relevant convention, slammed the U.S. for violating the rights of ethnic minorities, indigenous people, immigrants and other minority groups. It criticized the fact that members of racial and ethnic minorities continued to be disproportionately arrested, incarcerated and subjected to harsher sentences (tbinternet.ohchr.org).

Money is a deciding factor in the U.S. politics, and the U.S. citizens' political rights were not properly protected. Despite the highest midterm election spending in history, general election voter turnout for the 2014 midterms was the lowest since World War II. "Dark money" flowed into elections, and the voting rights of racial minorities and other groups were intentionally suppressed. A few interest groups with power were able to influence the government's decision-making. As a renowned scholar pointed out sharply, the U.S. democratic system was experiencing a crisis of representation. "Ordinary citizens feel that their supposedly democratic government no longer truly reflects their interests and is under the control of a variety of shadowy elites (Foreign Affairs, September/October 2014)."

Although the U.S. is the most developed country in the world, it is hard for the economic and social rights of its citizens to be soundly ensured. In the process of economic recovery, the income inequality continued to be enlarged, the basic living conditions for the homeless people deteriorated, the health care system operated terribly and the education rights of average citizens were violated. In October 2014, the United Nations Special Rapporteurs criticized the unprecedented water shut-offs in Detroit disproportionately affected the most vulnerable and poorest people, violating their right of access to drinking water and other international human rights.

American women and children's rights were not fully protected. Women were discriminated at workplaces, and domestic violence was prevalent. Each year, 2.1 million American women on average were assaulted by men. Three females were murdered by their partner each day, and four females died each day as a result of abuse. In the U.S. military, reports of female soldiers getting harassed were on the rise, and more faced repercussions for reporting assaults. Millions of American children were homeless. Three children died each day as a result of abuse. School violence and sex assaults were pervasive and gun shootings happened from time to time.

National Security Agency and other intelligence-gathering apparatus of the U.S. for a long time have spied on world leaders and civilians. The U.S. has not ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The U.S. government often takes an evasive or uncooperative attitude toward the criticism of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights of UN, the council's working groups and special rapporteurs.

[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Jewish Encyclopedia e8 843-0.jpg|thumb|right|174px|&lt;center&gt;Josippon (1546)]]

'''''Josippon''''' is a [[chronicle]] of [[Jewish history]] from [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] to the age of [[Titus]] believed to have been written by Josippon or [[Josephus Flavius]] (Joseph ben Matityahu) or maybe by a medieval Italian Jew called Yosef Ben Gurion. The [[Ethiopian Biblical canon#Ethiopic Pseudo-Josephus|Ethiopic version]] of ''Josippon'' is recognized as [[Biblical canon|canonical]] by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger|Metzger, Bruce M.]] (1993) "Bible." In Metzger, Bruce M.; Coogan, Michael David. ''The Oxford Companion to the Bible''. Oxford University Press. p. 79. {{ISBN|9780199743919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Sefer Josippon was compiled in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] early in the 10th century by a Jewish native of the [[Judæo-Greek|Greek speaking Jewish]] community of [[Catepanate of Italy|South Italy]], which was at that time part of the [[History of the Jews in the Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Historiography among Byzantine Jews: The case of Sefer Yosippon. Saskia Dönitz, 2012, Brill&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Judah Leon ben Moses Mosconi]], a [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniote Jew]] from [[Ohrid|Achrida]] edited and expanded the Sefer Josippon.&lt;ref&gt;Medieval Jewish Civilisation: An Encyclopedia, Norman Roth, 2014 p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jews in Byzantium: Dialectics of Minority and Majority Cultures, Robert Bonfil, 2011, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition was printed in [[Mantua]] in 1476. The book subsequently appeared in many forms, one of the most popular being in [[Yiddish]], with quaint illustrations. Though the chronicle is more legendary than historical, it is not unlikely that ancient sources were used by the first compiler. The book enjoyed great popularity in England. In 1558, [[Peter Morvyn]] translated an abbreviated version into English, and edition after edition was called for. [[Lucien Wolf]] has shown that the English translations of the Bible aroused so much interest in the Jews that there was a widespread desire to know more about them. This led to the circulation of many editions of ''Josippon'', which thus formed a link in the chain of events which culminated in the readmission of the Jews to England by [[Oliver Cromwell]]. 
The work is ascribed to Joseph ben Gorion (יוסף בן גוריון), a Jew living in southern [[Italy]] in either the 9th or the 10th century. As the Muslim writer [[ibn Hazm]] (d. 1063) was acquainted with the Arabic translation by a [[Yemenite Jew]], [[Daniel Chwolson]] proposes that the author lived at the beginning of the 9th century.

The author professes to be the old Jewish-Roman historian [[Flavius Josephus]], giving to the name "Joseph" the Greek ending "on" ("Josephon," "Joseppon," or "Josippon". His [[Arabic]] name "Yusibus" is, according to Wellhausen, identical with "[[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]]"). A gloss gives the form from the Italian, "Giuseppe." Trieber held the singular view that the author lived in the 4th century, and derived much of his material from Hegesippus.

Commencing with [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] and the geographical conditions of the first millennium BCE, the author passes to the legendary history of Rome and Babylon, to the accounts of [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]], [[Zerubbabel]] (according to the [[Apocrypha]]), the [[Second Temple]], and [[Cyrus the Great]], and to the histories of [[Alexander the Great]] and his successors. He then gives the history of the Jews down to the destruction of the Temple. The last part contains, among other things, a brief history of [[Hannibal]] and an account of the coronation of an emperor, which, according to [[Basnage]]&lt;ref&gt;''Histoire des Juifs,'' vii. 89, Paris, 1710.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to that of [[Otto the Great]] (crowned 962); this would be the only and a most valuable source of information concerning this event. If Basnage's conjecture is correct, the date of the composition of the "Yosippon" may be placed at the end of the 10th century. "Yosippon" is written in comparatively pure [[Biblical Hebrew]], shows a predilection for certain Biblical phrases and archaisms, and is rich in poetical passages and in maxims and philosophical speculations.

==Value as a historical source==
"Yosippon" was much read and was highly respected as a historical source by the Jews of the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] in his "Elenchus Trihæresii Nicolai Serarii" was the first to doubt its worth; [[Johannes van den Driesche|Jan Drusius]] (d. 1609) held it to be historically valueless on account of its many chronological mistakes; [[Zunz]] and [[Franz Delitzsch|Delitzsch]] have branded the author as an impostor. In fact, both the manuscripts and printed editions are full of historical errors, misconceptions of its sources, and extravagant outbursts of vanity on the part of the author. But there is scarcely any book in Jewish literature that has undergone more changes at the hands of copyists and compilers; [[Judah/Leon ben Moses/Moskoni|Judah ibn Moskoni]] knew of no less than four different compilations or abridgments. The later printed editions are one-third larger than the editio princeps of [[Mantua]].

==Evolution of the title==
It was perhaps due to Jerahmeel ben Solomon that the work received its traditional title "Yosippon." He supplemented his copy from Josephus, whom he designates as "the great Joseph." The original title of the work, according to Trieber, was probably "History of Jerusalem",&lt;ref&gt;as in ed. Mantua, p. 133a&lt;/ref&gt; or, as a manuscript suggests, "History and Wars of the Jews." It is quoted in the Hebrew-Persian dictionary of [[Solomon ben Samuel]] (14th century), under the title "History of the Second Temple."

==Literary criticism==
[[Sebastian Münster]]'s edition&lt;ref&gt;[[Basel]], 1541.&lt;/ref&gt; omits as not genuine the legendary introduction&lt;ref&gt;ch. i.-iii.&lt;/ref&gt; with its genealogical list,&lt;ref&gt;which addition, however, was made as early as the 12th century; see [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] on Psalm cx. 5; [[David Kimchi]], "Sefer ha-Shorashim," s.v.&lt;/ref&gt; and also ch. lxvii. to the end, narrating the expedition of [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]] against Jerusalem. [[Azariah dei Rossi]] also recognized that the [[Alexander Romance]] of [[Pseudo-Callisthenes]] in a Hebrew translation had been smuggled into the first edition; and, following [[David Kimchi]], Rapoport showed that the last chapter belonged to [[Abraham ibn Daud]].&lt;ref&gt;see Kimchi on [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] xi. 14 [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2311.htm]; also ''Sefer ha-Shorashim.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zunz]] has shown many other portions of the work to be Spanish additions, made in the 12th century. Almost the whole account of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Diadochi|his successors]] has been proved by Trieber to be of later origin. According to that critic, the part of the work original with its author ended with ch. lv. (the dedication of [[Herod's Temple]]), more or less of the remainder being taken from [[Pseudo-Hegesippus]], and perhaps added as early as the 5th century. This would explain the numerous contradictions and style-differences between these two parts.

There remains, as the nucleus of the whole chronicle, a history of the Second Temple, beginning with the [[apocrypha]]l stories concerning [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]], [[Zerubbabel]], etc., and finishing with the restoration of the Temple under Herod. A copyist of Pseudo-Hegesippus, however, identified the "Joseph ben Gorion" (Josephum Gorione Genitum), a prefect of Jerusalem, mentioned in iii. 3, 2 et seq., with the historian [[Josephus|Josephus ben Mattithiah]], at this time governor of the troops in [[Galilee]]. This may account for the fact that the chronicle was ascribed to Joseph b. Gorion.

[[Julius Wellhausen]], agreeing with Trieber, denies that the genuine part has any historical value whatever. Trieber contends that the author did not draw his information directly from Josephus or from the [[Second Book of Maccabees]], as is usually believed, and as Wellhausen maintains. He believes that both II Maccabees and the "Yosippon" used the work of [[Jason of Cyrene]], and Josephus and the "Yosippon" that of [[Nicholas of Damascus]].{{citeneeded|date=April 2017}}

==Editions==
#The first edition of the "Yosippon" was published in [[Mantua]] by [[Abraham Conat]] (1476–79), who also wrote a preface to it. Other editions are:
#[[Constantinople]], 1510; arranged and enlarged, with a preface by [[Tam ibn Yahya]] ben David. It is borrowed to a great extent from that of [[Judah Leon ben Moses Mosconi]] (b. 1328), published in ''Otzar Ṭob,'' 1878, i. 017 ''et seq.''&lt;ref&gt;see Berliner's "Magazin," 1876, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The text in this edition is divided into ninety-seven chapters.
#Basel, 1541; with a [[Latin]] preface, and a translation from the text of the editio princeps, by Sebastian Münster. The edition, however, contains only chapters iv. to lxiii.; the remaining chapters have been translated into Latin by [[David Kyberus]] (''Historia Belli Judaici'', in [[De la Bigne]]'s "Bibliotheca Patrum'', Paris).
#Venice, 1544; reprinted from the Constantinople edition, as were all the following editions.
#Cracow, 1588 and 1599.
#Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1689.
#Gotha, 1707 and 1710; with Münster's preface and a Latin translation and notes by Friedrich Breithaupt. Other editions appeared at Amsterdam (1723), Prague (1784), [[Warsaw]] (1845 and 1871), [[Zhitomir]] (1851), and [[Lvov]] (1855).&lt;ref&gt;see Steinschneider, "Hebr. Bibl." xi. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations and compilations==
A Yiddish translation with illustrations was published by Michael Adam ([[Zürich]], 1546; [[Prague]], 1607; [[Amsterdam]], 1661); it was later revised by [[Menahem ben Solomon ha-Levi]], and published under the title ''Keter Torah'' (Amsterdam, 1743). Another Latin translation, with [[Tam ibn Yahya]]'s preface, was published by [[Joseph Gagnier]] ([[Oxford]], 1706); a French translation of Kyberus' Latin supplement by F. de Belleforest was published in [[Genebrard]]'s French translation of Josephus (Paris, 1609). The oldest extant abstract was made in southern Italy, about 1150, by Jerahmeel ben Solomon&lt;ref&gt;See the fragments published by Neubauer, ''M. J. C.'' i. 190; ''J. Q. R.'' xi. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; and the translation of a portion by [[Moses Gaster]].&lt;ref&gt;''The [[Chronicles of Jerahmeel]]'', London, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; Another abstract, made in 1161 by [[Abraham ibn Daud]] and used as the third book of his ''[[Sefer Seder ha-Qabbalah]]'' was published ([[Mantua]], 1513; [[Venice]], 1545; [[Basel]], 1580, etc.), with Münster's Latin translation, at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] (1529) and Basel (1559). 

An English translation of this abstract was made by Peter Morvyn (London, 1558, 1561, 1575, 1608). A Yiddish compendium by [[Edel bat Moses]] was published in [[Kraków]] in 1670; the oldest German extract, under the title "Joseppi Jüdische Historien" (author not known) is described in Wolf, "Bibl. Hebr." (iii. 389). Some short extracts, in German, are given in [[Joseph Zedner]], ''Auswahl aus Hebräischen Schriftstellern'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;16 et seq.), and in Winter and Wünsche, ''Die Jüdische Litteratur.'' iii. 310 et seq.). 

In the Arabic and Yemenite translations, the author is called "Yusuf ibn Qaryun."

[[Image:Kaiserchronik 109.jpg|thumb|Fol. 109a of the Munich ms. (Cgm 37, dated  c. 1325-1350).]]
The '''''Kaiserchronik''''' (''Imperial Chronicle'') is a 12th-century chronicle written in 17,283 lines of [[Middle High German]] verse.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Shaw, "Kaiserchronik", ''Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle'', 2010, p. 956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard Nellmann, "Kaiserchronik", ''Lexikon des Mittelalters'', vol. 5, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; It runs from [[Julius Caesar]] to [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]], and seeks to give a complete account of the history of [[Roman emperors|Roman]] and [[German emperor]]s and [[List of German Kings and Emperors|kings]], based on a historiographical view of the continuity of the Roman and German successions. The overall pattern is of a progression from pagan to Christian worlds, and theological disputations stand at the turning-points of the Christianization of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Dunphy, "On the Function of the Disputations in the Kaiserchronik", ''The Medieval Chronicle'', 5 (2009), pp. 77-86.&lt;/ref&gt; However, much of the material is legendary and fantastic, suggesting that large sections are compiled from earlier works, mostly shorter biographies and saints' lives.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Ohly, ''Sage und Legende in der Kaiserchronik'', 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chronicle was written in [[Regensburg]] some time after 1146. The poet (or at least the final compiler) was presumably a cleric in secular service, a partisan of the [[House of Guelph|Guelph]]s. However the view that it was written by [[Konrad der Pfaffe]], author of the ''[[Rolandslied]]'', has been discredited. Known sources include the ''[[Chronicon Wirzeburgense]]'', the Chronicle of [[Ekkehard of Aura]], and the ''[[Annolied]]''; the relationship to the ''Annolied'' has received particular attention in scholarship, as earlier views of the priority of the ''Kaiserchronik'', or of a shared source, were gradually dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Mathias Herweg, ''Ludwigslied, De Heinrico, Annolied: Die deutschen Zeitdichtungen des frühen Mittelalters im Spiegel ihrer wissenschaftlichen Rezeption und Erforschung'', Wiesbaden: Reichert, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Judging from the large number of surviving manuscripts (twelve complete and seventeen partial), it must have been very popular, and it was twice continued in the 13th century: the first addition, the "Bavarian continuation", comprised 800 verses, while the second, the "Swabian continuation", which brought the poem to [[Holy Roman Empire#Interregnum| the Interregnum]] (1254&amp;ndash;73), consisted of 483 lines. The ''Kaiserchronik'' in turn was used as an important source for other verse chronicles in the thirteenth century, most notably that of [[Jans der Enikel]].

The text of the ''Kaiserchronik'' is preserved in a total of some 50 manuscripts, of which 20 have the full text.
Of these, five predate the 14th century, including one of the late 12th century (the Vorau ms.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handschriftencensus.de/werke/189 handschriftencensus.de]&lt;/ref&gt;
The main witnesses are:
*Vorau, Stiftsbibl., Cod. 276 (früher XI), c. 1175-1200 (Schröder ms. 1)
*Heidelberg, Universitätsbibl., Cpg 361, mid-13th c. (Schröder  ms. 4)
*Prag, Nationalbibl., Cod. XXIII.G.43, c. 1225-1250 (Schröder ms. 18)
*Wien, Österr. Nationalbibl., Cod. 413, mid-13th c. (Schröder ms. 25)
*Wien, Österr. Nationalbibl., Cod. 2693, c. 1275-1300 (Schröder ms. 16)
*München, Staatsbibl., Cgm 37, c. 1325-1350 (Schröder  ms. 2)
*Wolfenbüttel, Herzog August Bibl., Cod. 15.2 Aug. 2°, early 14th c. (incomplete text, Schröder ms. 3)

The chronicle was first edited in full in 1849-54 by [[Hans Ferdinand Massmann]],&lt;ref&gt;Massmann, H. F. ''Der keiser und der kunige buoch, oder die sogenannte Kaiserchronik, Gedicht des 12. Jahrhunderts in 18578 Reimzeilen''. 3 vols. (Quedlinburg, Basse, 1849–54)&lt;/ref&gt;
Massmann was in a bitter academic dispute with [[August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben]], an "almost proprietal struggle" over the priority of the respective manuscripts they had access to. Müller (1999) categorizes Massmann's work as an  an ''editionsphilologischer [[Amok]]lauf'' (as it were "editorial philology gone postal"), as Massmann goes out of his way to ignore the Vorau ms., to the point of using the 1639 edition of ''[[Annolied]]'' by [[Martin Opitz]] as a "Kaiserchronik fragment" in higher standing than the Vorau ms.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Müller, ''Vom Annolied zur Kaiserchronik: Zur Text- und Forschungsgeschichte einer verlorenen deutschen Reimchronik'', Heidelberg: Carl Winter 1999.
"Muller rightly categorizes Massmann's Kaiserchronik as an 'editionsphilologischer Amoklauf', highlighting how he cited Opitz's Annolied as a Kaiserchronik fragment and used it as such in his own apparatus. Massmann insisted on the priority of the Heidelberg manuscript over that of Vorau, largely because he had access to it, which put him personally in a position of power. Editing the Daniel passages, which are missing in the Heidelberg manuscript, he spurned the Vorau text, adopting instead the wording of Opitz with the verses rearranged into the Vorau manuscript's sequence. Muller cheekily calls early scholars like Massmann, whose work has been superseded yet whose influence lingers, the 'Untoten', the 'living dead'."  Graeme Dunphy, review of Müller (1999) in  in ''Modern Language Review'', 98 (2003), pp. 755-757.[ https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Vom+Annolied+zur+Kaiserchronik%3A+Zu+Text-+und+Forschungsgeschichte...-a0106557422 ]&lt;/ref&gt;
The only critical edition besides Massmann's is  that of [[Edward Schröder]] (1892).&lt;ref&gt;Schröder, E., ed. ''Die Kaiserchronik eines Regensburger Geistlichen'' Hanover: Hahnsche Buchhandlung; in ''Monumenta Germaniae historica. Deutsche Chroniken'' I,i (1892).&lt;/ref&gt; 
There is also a classroom edition of excerpts with parallel translations in English.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Schultz (ed./tr), ''Sovereignty and Salvation in the Vernacular, 1050-1150. Das Ezzolied, Das Annolied, Die Kaiserchronik vv. 247-667, Das Lob Salomons, Historia Judith''. (= Medieval German Texts in Bilingual Editions vol. 1), Kalamazoo MI: Western Michigan University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!--A project to produce a complete new edition with parallel English translation and at the same time place scans of all manuscripts on-line was announced by the University of London in December 2012.--&gt;

The '''Declaration of Independence'''  is the statement adopted by the 33 racial representatives meeting at Taehwagwan, [[Insa-dong]], [[Jongno District]], [[Seoul]] on March 1, 1919, after [[World War I]], which announced that the Korea would no longer be [[Korea under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]].

This was the beginning of the [[March 1st Movement]], which was violently suppressed by Japanese authorities. Korea's independence would come only after the defeat of Japan in [[World War II]], nearly thirty years later.

'''''Merkantilt biografisk leksikon: hvem er hvem i næringslivet?''''' ({{lang-en|Mercantile Biographical Encyclopedia: Who is Who in the Enterprise?}}) was a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian-language]] encyclopedia published by Yrkesforlaget in 1935.

It featured approximately 10,000 short biographical entries for Norwegian businesspeople, and was edited by [[Einar Hoffstad]] (1894–1959).{{r|eh|forord}} It was printed by [[Grøndahl &amp; Søn Forlag|Grøndahl &amp; Søns Boktrykkeri]].{{r|titlepage}} The purpose of the encyclopedia was to "remedy the need to know something about the individuals one is trading with".{{r|hensikt}} The entries contain little genealogical information, and the parents of the portrayed businesspeople are not included.{{r|art}} Abbreviations are used extensively to save space and money.{{r|forkortelser}}

The editor, Einar Hoffstad, stated in the foreword of the encyclopedia that it was not a parallel to the ''[[Who's Who]]'' reference works, although the title could imply that.{{r|forord}} Hoffstad argued that ''Merkantilt biografisk leksikon'' featured too few and too many names for being a ''Who is Who''—too few from areas such as art, literature, science and politics, whilst too many from the enterprise. He also admitted that the encyclopedia included too many people, even from commerce, to be called a mercantile reference work.{{r|forord}} The notability standards for the encyclopedia were mostly based on the discretion of the staff, and whether the portrayed individuals were of general interest at the time. Trustees in commercial organisations, editors of trade press and successful traders were automatically included.{{r|utvalg}}

In a book review, the newspaper ''[[Aftenposten]]'' stated that the Mercantile Biographical Encyclopedia had a "pretentious" title as it was a "strange mixture of book and advertising". According to the reviewer Tharald Borgir there were several errors, and he lamented that Hoffstad in the foreword had disclaimed responsibility for such errors. The reviewer found it "unbelievable" that the book was being offered, and that "gullible" people paid {{NOK|20|lk=yes}} to buy it. He suggested that the [[Ministry of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Ministry of Justice]] be on guard for further "backslide" regarding the "freedom of liability" when it came to such information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hvem er hvem? Merkantilt Biografisk Leksikon|last=Borgir|first=Tharald|date=31 July 1935|work=[[Aftenposten]]|page=8|language=Norwegian|mode=cs2 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffstad replied that although a large reference work was bound to contain some errors, his helpers had been reliable, and Borgir had been inquired six times to aid Hoffstad with the encyclopedia without replying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Merkantilt Biografisk Leksikon. "Hvem er Hvem i næringslivet?"|last=Hoffstad|first=Einar|date=2 August 1935|work=[[Aftenposten]]|page=2|language=Norwegian|mode=cs2 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclopedia was published in a second, revised edition in 1939, this time by Halvorsen &amp; Larsen.{{r|2ndEd}} In October 2009, [[Project Runeberg]] scanned and made the encyclopedia's first edition available online.{{r|runeberg}}

[[File:Palace Basilica Constantinople.svg|thumb|Ground plan of the Palace Basilica]]
The '''Palace Basilica''' is a ruined [[basilica]] in the Second Courtyard of [[Topkapı Palace]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]. 

The remains were excavated in 1937. Since the name of the church cannot be found, the remains have been named after the location of Topkapı Palace. The basilica was probably constructed around the 5th century [[Common Era|AD]], and it underwent repairs between the 10th–12th century.

The church with three naves measured 35x21 metres. The external facade of the apse is three-sided: the inner facade is semicircular. The entrance to the atrium is on the north side.

The door at the centre is the Saltykov Entrance.]]

The '''Private Apartments of the Winter Palace''' are sited on the [[piano nobile]] of the western wing of the former imperial palace, [[Winter Palace|the Winter Palace]] in [[St Petersburg]]. Access to the private rooms, for members of the Imperial Family, from the exterior was usually through the Saltykov Entrance (''centre in the photograph to the right'') which was reserved for use by only the Tsar, Tsaritsa and grand dukes and grand duchesses. A second access was through a discrete box-like porch, on the western end of the Palace's Neva façade. From the ground floor, it can be accessed from the October Staircase, formerly known as His Majesty's Own Staircase; this double-flighted [[imperial staircase]] was a secondary entrance to the private apartments, and provided a more convenient route to the palace's ground floor and private entrances than the more formal and ceremonial public route through the state apartments. During the October Revolution of 1917, this was the entrance by which the revolutionaries gained access to the palace in order to arrest the Provisional Government in the small private dining room. Since that date it has been known as the October Staircase and has a plaque commemorating the event. Despite its size and grandeur, the October Staircase was a secondary staircase, the [[Jordan Staircase of the Winter Palace|Jordan Staircase]] being the principal.{{r|Staircase}}

From the palace's more formal rooms, the private apartments are entered through the rotunda, a circular room which served as an ante and waiting room for those to be received by the Tsar. Another entrance is from the [[Malachite Room of the Winter Palace|Malachite Drawing Room]], which served as both a private and state room, and was often the assembly point for the beginning of imperial processions from the neighbouring [[Arabian Hall of the Winter Palace|Arabian Hall]] which led to the [[Neva Enfilade of the Winter Palace|principal state apartments]] &amp;ndash; particularly for imperial weddings, when the bride would be formally dressed in the Romanoff wedding regalia by the Tsaritsa in the Malachite Drawing Room.

The private rooms overlook a lawned and wooded garden, created from a former parade ground by the last Empress of Russia, who wanted a private place for her children to play.

Until 1917, this wing was rather like a private house within a palace; it was used by the Imperial Family whenever in residence. Following a severe fire in 1837 when most of the palace was destroyed, the private apartments were rebuilt in various styles according to the tastes of their intended, individual occupants, the immediate family of Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]; thus they are an array of eclectic styles and loose interpretations of earlier 18th century tastes and fashions. During the reigns of the following three Tsars many changes were made in decoration and use, but the layout remained essentially unchanged. In 1904, the last Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and his family abandoned the Winter Palace in favour of the more private [[Alexander Palace]] at [[Tsarskoye Selo]]. From this date until the fall of the monarchy, the Winter Palace was used only for formal state occasions.{{r|Historicism}}

It was in the Private wing of the Winter Palace, following the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, that the [[Russian Provisional Government]] established itself. A few months later during the [[October Revolution]] this was the area of the palace most damaged during the famous [[The Storming of the Winter Palace|Storming of the Winter Palace]], a defining moment in Russia's history.

The plan used ''(right)'' is based on the arrangement of rooms prior to 1917; it has since been altered to accommodate the palace's use today as part of the complex of buildings which comprise the [[State Hermitage Museum]]. Many of the former private rooms are not regularly open to the public, or have been much changed.

==Apartments of Nicholas I and Alexandra Feodorovna==
[[File:Winter Palace Rotonda1834.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Rotunda of the Winter Palace|The Rotunda]] (28 on the plan). This circular, domed hall, dating from the early 19th century, links the state and private rooms of the palace, and in its design represents the final and neoclassical stage of the palace's evolution.]]

The apartments of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] and his wife, [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Alexandra Feodorovna]], were in the northwest corner of the palace, a suite traditionally occupied by the monarch since the time of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]], and now form part of the Apartments of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna. Catherine the Great had her throne room here, before [[Giacomo Quarenghi]] completed the building of the larger [[St George's Hall, and Apollo Hall of the Winter Palace|St George's Hall]] in the eastern wing in 1787, suggesting that rooms were formerly less intimate and private than they latterly became. During the 1780s, the interior design of the palace was changed from the ornate rococo designed by [[Francesco Rastrelli]] to the simpler [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] decoration still prevalent in the state rooms today; the private rooms, however, seem to have been frequently redecorated according to the (often simple) tastes of their occupants;{{sfnp|Piotrovsky|Torshina|Kudryavtseva|Fateyev|2000|p=66|ps=none}} and in terms of decoration, luxury and use they do not correspond to the [[Petit appartement du roi]] at Versailles.

Following the fire of 1837, Nicholas I was responsible for the rapid rebuilding of the palace. He insisted that the exterior remain unchanged, but allowed large parts of the interior to be redesigned in a variety of tastes and styles, leading the palace to be described as "A 19th-century palace inspired by a model in [[rococo]] style."{{sfnp|Budberg|1969|p=200|ps=none}}

[[File:Maria Alexandrovnabedroom.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The bedroom of Tsaritsa [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse and by Rhine)|Maria Alexandrovna]]]]

Several eminent architects were employed to rebuild the palace, most notably [[Vasily Stasov]], who was charged with the rebuilding of the state rooms in identical or similar styles to that which had been before, and [[Alexander Brullov]].{{sfnp|Piotrovsky|Torshina|Kudryavtseva|Fateyev|2000|p=78|ps=none}} It is Brullov who is most closely associated with the private apartments.{{sfnp|Piotrovsky|Torshina|Kudryavtseva|Fateyev|2000|p=78|ps=none}} Able to work competently in a variety of styles, his commission was to rebuild the private and semi-private rooms according to the tastes of their intended occupants.

The architects involved in the rebuilding of the palace were able to take advantage of construction developments not available to Rastrelli and Quarenghi in their original plans. Following the fire, it was discovered that large quantities of wood and hidden voids had been one of the reasons the fire had spread so drastically. In order to avoid a repeat of this, hidden behind the new but classical façades, the architects were able to use the latest techniques in building. These included the large-scale use of steel to support the vast ceiling spans of the Baroque state rooms, avoiding the need for supporting columns.{{sfnp|Piotrovsky|Torshina|Kudryavtseva|Fateyev|2000|pp=77–78|ps=none}} However, in the smaller rooms the ceilings were built with less flammable brick vaults, which were to have a significant effect on Brullov's decorative schemes for the private rooms. Vaulting lent itself to both [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] and [[Byzantine]] forms of interior design. Nowhere in the palace is the Gothic more evident than in the ground floor drawing room created by Brullov in 1838 for the daughters of Nicholas I.

Later the architect [[Andrei Stakenschneider]] was employed to carry out many projects at the palace.{{sfnp|Piotrovsky|Torshina|Kudryavtseva|Fateyev|2000|p=169|ps=none}} He decorated the crimson boudoir of the Tsaritsa Alexandra Feodorovna in a Rococo revival that Quarenghi had all but eradicated from the palace 70 years earlier.

==Apartments of Alexander II and Tsaritsa Maria Alexandrovna==

[[File:Гау.Малиновый кабинет Марии Александровны.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Crimson Cabinet, the study of Maria Alexandrovna]]
[[File:Cherentsov Cabinet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tsar Alexander II died on the ''chaise longue'' by the columns]]
This suite of rooms is at the centre and southern end of the private wing, overlooking the [[Admiralty building, Saint Petersburg|Admiralty]] and [[Palace Square]]. In the apartment of the Tsaritsa, originally rebuilt by Brullov, the hand of Andrei Stakenschneider is evident. His chief distinction was an ability to combine an eclectic mix of architectural styles, frequently combining Classical, Gothic and Oriental motifs in the same scheme. This is nowhere more obvious that in the suite created for [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Tsaritsa Maria Alexandrovna]], where the [[Gold Drawing Room of the Winter Palace|Gold Drawing Room]] combines all of these motifs. Maria Alexandrovna used the Gold Drawing room as her state Drawing Room with her more private rooms beyond: the Crimson Drawing Room followed by her Boudoir, before the most private of her rooms, the bedroom. Her study, in a corner of the palace, by contrast with the preceding Gold Drawing Room was simply decorated having plain white walls adorned only with gilded sconces, and a vaulted ceiling broken onto palales by gilded moulding.{{r|Hermitage}} By contrast again, the small boudoir beyond was in an ornate rococo revival style created by the architect [[Harald Julius von Bosse|Harald Bosse]] in 1853.{{sfnp|Piotrovsky|Torshina|Kudryavtseva|Fateyev|2000|p=104|ps=none}}

===Tsar's Study (14)===

Until the assassination of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], this room was traditionally the Tsar's study, having been used for this purpose by both Alexander I and Nicholas I. Originally designed by Giacomo Quarenghi{{r|Bust}} in 1791, the room contains a recessed alcove in the style of a Baroque state bedroom, indicative of its original use. Following the fire of 1837 it was redesigned by Alexander Brullov.

It was here, in March 1881, that the fatally wounded Alexander II was carried to die (on the chaise longue to the right of the picture). Following his death a memorial bust was placed on the spot where he died; this remains in place today.{{r|Bust}} The room, like many of the private rooms, is accessed from the aptly named "dark corridor." It was along this long passageway that [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Fedorovna]] in her memoirs talked of following great drips of congealed blood to find the dying Tsar in his study.{{sfnp|Feodorovna|2005|ps=none}}

&lt;!--Today, the study is used for the display of late 18th century art and antique uniforms, as part of the State Hermitage Museum.--&gt;

==Apartments of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna (2&amp;ndash;10)==

[[File:WinterPalaceRoom.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A former drawing room of the Empress Alexandra Feodorovna (room No. 4 on plan above). The marble chimney piece is a replacement.]]

[[Nicholas II]] ascended the throne in 1894 and married his wife, [[Alix of Hesse|Tsaritsa Alexandra Feodorovna]] in the first days of his reign in a lavish ceremony at the Winter Palace.{{sfnp|Kurth|1995|p=50|ps=none}} Immediately after the ceremony, his mother insisted the couple make their home with her at the Anichkov Palace. There they began their married life in six small rooms.{{sfnp|Massie|1967|p=61|ps=none}}

The Dowager Tsaritsa forbade the new Tsar and his wife to set up their own court until six months after her husband's death.{{efn|In Russia, the Tsar's mother took precedence over his wife.}} Therefore it was not until May 1895, when the Dowager went to Copenhagen, that the couple could set up their own household, but it was first a small palace at [[Peterhof Palace Complex|Peterhof]] and then the [[Alexander Palace]] in the imperial compound at [[Tsarskoe Selo]], which even at this early stage in their marriage and reign became their near-permanent home.{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|p=244|ps=none}}

[[File:Imperial bedroom1900.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The bedroom of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna photographed in 1900.]]

From December 1895, however, the Tsar and Tsaritsa did reside for periods during the winter at the Winter Palace. They extended and redesigned the rooms which had been prepared for Nicholas, as [[Tsarevich]] two years earlier.{{sfnp|Piotrovsky|Torshina|Kudryavtseva|Fateyev|2000|p=174|ps=none}} The architect, [[Alexander Krasovsky]], was commissioned to redecorate a suite of rooms in the northwest corner of the palace. He lowered many of the vaults, the flatter ceilings creating a more intimate atmosphere. He often employed a different era as the theme for each room, ranging from medieval to rococo and art nouveau. In style and content, the suite was intended to epitomise the domestic ethic of the couple, which was to live in an almost bourgeois fashion in small cosy home; at heart the Tsaritsa was a "hausfrau".{{sfnp|Kurth|1995|p=56|ps=none}} She was criticised for her taste, which was to "make over in the style of an English gentlewoman, stuffing rooms with knickknacks and drowning them in chintz."{{sfnp|Kurth|1995|p=55|ps=none}} The court was horrified that the furniture was purchased mail order from Maples of London, while her mauve boudoir has been described as "a horror to all who saw it."{{sfnp|Kurth|1995|p=56|ps=none}}

Unlike most sovereigns of the day, Nicholas II and his wife shared a bedroom (5).{{sfnp|Massie|1967|p=130|ps=none}} From this was a large bathroom (overlooking an internal courtyard) designed by the court architect, Krasovsky, which had a sunken bath reached by eight marble steps. The bath was in a recess lined with Dresden tiles.

The Tsaritsa also created the private garden (35) beneath the windows of the private apartments on the site of a former parade ground.{{r|Hermitage}} Before this, the only garden of the palace was the very overlooked one (32) created in the palace's principal courtyard for [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|her mother-in-law]] a few years earlier. [[Gardens of the Winter Palace|These two areas]] remain the only gardens of the palace.

During the reign of Nicholas II and his wife, court life was quieter than it had ever been, due to the Tsaritsa's retiring nature and mistrust of St Petersburg's high society.{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|p=247|ps=none}} In the Tsaritsa's opinion: "Saint Petersburg is a rotten town, and not one atom Russian."{{sfnp|Radziwill|1931|pp=158-9|ps=none}} Under her influence, gradually the great court receptions and balls at the Winter Palace, which humoured and cultivated the powerful nobility, came to an end, to be briefly replaced by theatricals held in the Hermitage which "no one enjoyed."{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|p=247|ps=none}} Then even the theatricals ceased.{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|p=247|ps=none}}

===Empire (2) and Silver (3) Drawing Rooms===

[[File:Пристань у Эрмитажа.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A 19th-century view of the private wing showing projecting, canopied balconies; these along with the wall surrounding the private garden have now been removed.]]

The Silver and Empire Drawing Rooms were part of the suite of rooms reserved for the private use of the Tsaritsa. They form an enfilade which culminates in the [[Malachite Room of the Winter Palace|Malachite Drawing Room]], which served as the Tsaritsa's State Drawing Room, where she gave audiences and conducted her official business. It was also in the Malachite Drawing Room that Romanov brides were traditionally robed before walking in procession through the state rooms to the Palace's Grand Church for their weddings.{{sfnp|Maylunas|Mironenko|1996|p=109|ps=none}}

Originally part of the suite of Maria Feodorovna,{{sfnp|Piotrovsky|Torshina|Kudryavtseva|Fateyev|2000|p=100|ps=none}} these two drawing rooms were redesigned for Nicholas II and [[Alix of Hesse|his wife]] in a French style, the Silver Drawing Room in a 19th-century interpretation of the Louis XVI style&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;looks more Louis XV to me&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; and the Empire Drawing Room in a faux Napoleonic [[empire style]]. From these rooms, the Tsaritsa was able to withdraw to still more private apartments, her boudoir, dressing room and bedroom.

===Study/Boudoir===

The former study or boudoir (4 on plan) of the Tsaritsa Alexandra Feodorovna (wife of Nicholas II) was redesigned for her by Alexander Krasovsky between 1894 and 1895. The room had previously formed the private suite of the wife of Nicholas I when, as her boudoir, it was decorated in red. For Nicholas I, devoted to his wife, spending an evening in this room with her was one of his favourite pastimes.{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|p=164|ps=none}}

&lt;!-- Bang on here about her much criticised pro-English taste for modern furniture (somewhere in Tsar)

--&gt;Today the room displays the work of [[Heinrich Gambs]], a notable Russian cabinet maker of the early 19th century.{{r|Gambs}}

===Gothic Library===

[[File:Winterpalacelibrary.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The Gothic library designed by Krasovsky for Nicholas II]]

The Gothic library (9 on the plan) is the largest room of the suite refurbished for Nicholas II by Krasovsky; he designed it in a form of heavy [[Pugin]]esque wooden gothic, redolent of romantic perceptions of the Middle Ages. Elsewhere, he employed themes ranging from the rococo to art nouveau. The library and the small dining rooms are the only rooms to retain their Krasovsky decoration.{{r|Hermitage}} Many of the rooms formerly belonging to Nicholas II are small, narrow, dark and awkward in design, especially Nicholas's narrow study.

===Small Dining Room (8)===

[[File:OctoberStaircase.jpg|thumb|left|upright|His Majesty's Own Staircase (today the October Staircase), which gives access to the private apartments from the ground floor. It was used by revolutionaries during the storming of the palace.{{sfnp|Piotrovsky|Torshina|Kudryavtseva|Fateyev|2000|p=98|ps=none}}]]

Formerly known as the Pompeian Dining Room, the Small Dining-room was redecorated in 1894&amp;ndash;95 for the newly married Nicholas II and his Tsaritsa, by Krasovsky. A rococo plaster-work style was chosen to frame 18th-century St Petersburg tapestries.{{r|Hermitage}}

Above the fireplace is a plaque recording the facts of the arrest of the Provisional Government which took place in this room on the night of 25 October 1917.{{r|Arrest}}

==Private apartments and the Hermitage Museum==

Following the Government's arrest in the Small Dining Room, an eyewitness account records a systematic destruction of the apartments by the Bolsheviks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Palace was pillaged and devastated from top to bottom by the Bolshevik[s]...Priceless pictures were ripped from their frames by bayonets. Packed boxes of rare plate and china...were broken open and the contents smashed or carried off. The library....was forced open and ransacked.....the Tsaritsa's salon, like all other rooms, was thrown into chaos. The colossal crystal lustre, with its artfully concealed music, was smashed to atoms. Desks, pictures, ornaments&amp;mdash;everything was destroyed.{{r|Guardian}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For a brief period following the revolution, the private apartments were open to the public to display the life of the former rulers,{{r|Luxury}} as this was the area of the palace where entry had been gained by the revolutionaries, and as a consequence, much had been destroyed so it is hard to know how accurate the depiction of the imperial private lives could have been. Today, with the exception of the library, the rooms are simply decorated and display part of the Hermitage Museum's vast collection of art; no reference is made to their former use. Much of the art collection displayed in the palace today is not original to the Winter Palace, but has been brought from numerous other palaces and estates which were nationalised after the revolution.

The '''Texas Almanac''' is a biennially published [[reference work]] providing information for the general public on the history of the state and its people, government and politics, economics, [[natural resources]], [[holidays]], culture, education, [[recreation]], [[the arts]], and other topics. Detailed information on each of the state's 254 [[County (United States)|counties]] is provided, along with analytical essays on a variety of topics unique to each edition; for example, topics in the 2006-2007 edition include the state's [[film industry]] and the history of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] and [[Syria]]n immigration to Texas. As with many other [[almanac]]s, an extensive [[astronomy|astronomical]] calendar is included. The present publisher is the [[Texas State Historical Association]], which acquired the Texas Almanac as a gift from the [[A. H. Belo Corporation]] on May 5, 2008.

==History==
The ''[[Galveston]] News'' published the first edition in 1857, scarcely a decade after the [[Republic of Texas]] joined the United States. This early version was published annually through 1873, with the sole exception of the year 1866. During the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] years, the document consisted of a [[pamphlet]] of fewer than 70 pages, published in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] (1862) or [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] (1863–65) due to Galveston's being [[blockade]]d by [[Union Army]] forces during that period. From 1867 through 1873, publication resumed in Galveston, although the name of the book was changed in 1869 to ''The Texas Almanac and [[Emigrant]]’s Guide to Texas''. Following the 1875 death of the publisher, the ''Almanac'' ceased publication for almost 30 years, until [[George Bannerman Dealey]] was sent by the Galveston paper to establish a branch in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] and decided that resuming the ''Almanac'' would foster investment in the state's growing economy.&lt;ref name="aboutus"&gt;[https://texasalmanac.com/about-us History of the ''Texas Almanac''], TexasAlmanac.com. Retrieved July 3, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1904 through 1929, the ''Almanac'' was published more or less annually, with breaks in publication due to events such as [[World War I]]. Beginning in 1929 with [[the Great Depression]], publication was switched to a biennial cycle; this change was not reflected in the title until the 1941-1942 edition. Special editions were created for the occasions of the 100th anniversary of the ''Almanac'', the death of G. B. Dealey, the coinciding 110th anniversary of the ''Almanac'' and 125th anniversary of Belo Corporation, the Texas [[Sesquicentennial]] celebrating 150 years of independence from [[Mexico]], and the sesquicentennial of the ''Almanac'', which was the first full-color edition. In 2006, [[Southern Methodist University]] issued a [[limited edition]] [[reprint]] of the 1936 ''Texas Almanac'', which commemorated the [[centennial]] of Texas' independence.&lt;ref name="smu"&gt;[http://www.smu.edu/swcenter/Almanac.htm ''Limited Edition Reprint of the Original 1936 Centennial Texas Almanac''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704225739/http://www.smu.edu/swcenter/Almanac.htm |date=2007-07-04 }}, Southern Methodist University. Retrieved June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic and supplementary works==
An electronic edition, ''Texas Almanac Online'', is published by [[Thomson Gale]]; the electronic edition is not available online to the general public, but only through subscribing institutions such as public libraries.&lt;ref name="thomson"&gt;[http://www.galegroup.com/servlet/ItemDetailServlet?region=9&amp;imprint=000&amp;titleCode=GAL47&amp;type=4&amp;id=115082 Thomson Gale Catalog: ''Texas Almanac Online'']. Retrieved June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Belo Corporation also publishes an educators' guide to the ''Texas Almanac''.

'''''The Cactaceae''''' is a monograph on plants of the cactus family written by the American botanists [[Nathaniel Lord Britton]] and [[Joseph Nelson Rose]] and published in multiple volumes between 1919 and 1923. It was landmark study that extensively reorganized cactus taxonomy and is still considered a cornerstone of the field.&lt;ref name=agpn/&gt; It was illustrated with drawings and color plates principally by the British botanical artist [[Mary Emily Eaton]] as well as with black-and-white photographs.

==History==
[[File:Britton Rose Cactaceae v1-plate34.jpg|thumb|Watercolor of several  ''Opuntia'' cactus species by Mary Emily Eaton for Britton and Rose's ''The Cactaceae'', 1919 (vol. 1, plate XXXIV).]]

Nathaniel Lord Britton was a Columbia University geology and biology professor who left the university in 1895 to become the founding director of the [[New York Botanical Garden]]. Much of his own field work was done in the Caribbean. Joseph Nelson Rose was an authority on several plant families, including parsley ([[Apiaceae]]) and cacti ([[Cactaceae]]). He had been a plant curator at the Smithsonian since 1896, and while working there he made several field trips to Mexico, collecting specimens for the Smithsonian and for Britton's newly founded New York Botanical Garden. Together, Britton and Rose published many articles on the stonecrop family ([[Crassulaceae]]) before embarking in 1904 on research leading towards ''The Cactaceae''. With the support of Douglas T. MacDougal, director of the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]]'s Desert Botanical Laboratory, the Carnegie Institution agreed to fund the project.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt; Rose took a leave of absence from the Smithsonian to pursue it, and both Rose and Britton were named Carnegie Institution Research Associates in 1912, when more focused work on the project began.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt; Between 1912 and 1916 Rose and Britton did extensive field work, collecting specimens and touring the botanical gardens and notable collections of Europe, the Caribbean, and North, Central, and South America.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt;

In this period, cactus taxonomy was in a disorganized state with only a few very large and heterogeneous genera.&lt;ref name=loph/&gt; Britton and Rose broke these old-style catch-all genera into smaller, more defined genera, ultimately classifying 1255 species under 124 genera.&lt;ref name=loph/&gt; It has been argued that with this first major overhaul of cactus genera, they ushered in an era of 'splitting' or liberalism in cactus taxonomy, in contrast to the conservative 'lumping' approach that characterized their predecessors.&lt;ref name=agpn/&gt;

Britton and Rose defined their genera by the characteristics of the cactus plants' vegetation, flowers, and fruit, as well as by their geographic distribution.&lt;ref name=loph/&gt; They drew on their own and others' field work, as well as on greenhouse studies and specimens in [[herbarium|herbaria]] to describe species included in their exhaustive study.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt; An important aspect of their work was their careful reexamination of existing type specimens, many of which turned out to have been incorrectly identified.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt;&lt;ref name=amre/&gt;

Britton and Rose published ''The Cactaceae'' in four volumes through the Carnegie Institution between 1919 and 1923. It "set new standards in cactus botany"&lt;ref name=loph/&gt; and has been called Britton's "magnum opus".&lt;ref name=nybg/&gt; Though it was considered definitive in its own day,&lt;ref name=amre/&gt; the taxonomy of Cactaceae has remained problematic, due in part to difficulties in preserving type specimens of cactus. Several taxonomic reorganizations have succeeded Britton and Rose's work, with the most recent major one dating to 1984. (See [[Cactus#Taxonomy and classification|Cactus]] entry for more details.) Despite this, the excellence of their work is reflected in the fact that some 50 of the 79 genera they authored are still considered phylogenetically sound, though some have been redefined.&lt;ref name=agpn/&gt;

A black-and-white reprint of the second (1937) edition of ''The Cactaceae'' was published by Dover Publications in 1963. In 2006, Daniel Schweich undertook a project to digitize the entire book, and all four volumes can now be downloaded in full color.

In 1911, the British illustrator [[Mary Emily Eaton]] moved to New York, where she was employed by the New York Botanical Garden for two decades. The great majority of color plates in the four volumes of  ''The Cactaceae''  are by Eaton, with a handful by other artists such as [[Deborah Griscom Passmore]], H.A. Wood, and Kako Morita.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt;&lt;ref name=hartwell/&gt; Eaton's compositions are striking and her watercolors are noted for their crispness and accuracy of botanical detail. 

The color plates are supplemented by black-and-white line drawings as well as by black-and-white photographs of cacti, ranging from long shots taken in the field to close-up details.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt; One contemporary reviewer called ''The Cactaceae'' “the most sumptuous botanical publication" since [[William Rickatson Dykes]]’ 1913 book ''The Genus Iris''.&lt;ref name=amre/&gt;

'''The Forgiveness Project'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theforgivenessproject.com/&lt;/ref&gt; is a UK-based [[Charitable organization|charity]] that uses real stories of victims and perpetrators of crime and violence to help people explore ideas around [[forgiveness]] and alternatives to revenge. With no political or religious affiliations, The Forgiveness Project’s independent and inclusive approach ensures its core message&amp;nbsp;– that everyone has the potential to change their perspective and break the cycle of vengeance&amp;nbsp;– resonates across all cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2006/jun/25/features.review17 |title=Could you forgive the unforgivable; The Guardian |publisher=theguardian.com |date=25 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims ==

The charity’s goals are centred on:
* Awareness:  Raise the debate about forgiveness by collecting and sharing personal stories.
* Education:  Encourage and empower people to explore the nature of forgiveness and alternatives to conflict and revenge.
* Transformation: Engage civil society, as well as transform hearts and minds, help individuals cope with their trauma.

== History ==

The charity was founded in 2004 by Marina Cantacuzino,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marina-cantacuzino/ |title=Marina Cantacuzino; The Huffington Post |publisher=www.huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a journalist who in the build up to the Iraq War began to gather personal stories from people whose lives had been affected by violence and terrorism but who had learned to forgive and move on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prisonerseducation.org.uk/index.php?id=187 |title=The Forgiveness Project; Prisoners’ Education Trust |publisher=prisonerseducation.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantacuzino spent all of 2003 collecting stories of reconciliation and forgiveness for an exhibition of words and images which she created with the photographer Brian Moody. These stories subsequently formed the basis of The Forgiveness Project’s ''The F Word'' exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.upf.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=427:marina-cantacuzino-the-forgiveness-project&amp;catid=36:peace-and-development&amp;Itemid=58|title=Marina Cantacuzino – The Forgiveness Project; Universal Peace Federation|last=|first=|authorlink=|date=|website=|publisher=Universal Peace Federation, United Kingdom Official|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept of rehabilitative storytelling ==

Central to their work is the sharing of personal accounts about people’s transformative journeys. Having collected over 130 personal stories on their website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theforgivenessproject.com/stories/ |title=The Forgiveness Project - Stories}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is also done through its exhibition, ''The F Word'', and via the award-winning programmes it runs within prisons, schools, community groups and companies.

In providing tools that can facilitate conflict resolution and reconciliation, The Forgiveness Project encourages behavioural change and improves people’s lives, whatever their story.

These story-led initiatives operate at a local, national and international level and encourage individuals to reflect on their current perspective and their future life path. Rather than give advice or tell people what to think, The Forgiveness Project works by inviting those involved to see whether they can relate to the stories they hear and to take steps in trying to see a different perspective on their circumstances.

== Themes ==
Stories collected by The Forgiveness Project follow multiple themes that the Project states "provide a framework to these forgiveness stories, adding a dimension to the narrative of hate, hurt, and healing." These themes are feeling pain and anger, being curious, forgiving yourself, developing empathy, seeking revenge, transforming hate, and making meaning. The Forgiveness Project believes that analyzing the themes "shows that while forgiveness is not a linear process, and seldom a one-off event, nevertheless certain qualities and values feature in most of the stories."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theforgivenessproject.com/themes|title=Themes|work=The Forgiveness Project|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''feeling pain and anger'''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theforgivenessproject.com/feeling-pain-and-anger|title=Feeling pain and anger|work=The Forgiveness Project|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anger can be self destructive--holding in feelings to reconcile with pain as well as enduring hate to others but anger can also be a good thing. It can be empowering; "reclaiming your voice or fighting for justice. Indeed, rage, sorrow and despair are part of the healing process, and may well become the launch pad for forgiveness."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* '''being curious'''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theforgivenessproject.com/being-curious|title=Being curious|work=The Forgiveness Project|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

curiosity is a crucial part of forgiveness and is antidote for hate. Curiosity opens up the door to imagination and allows you to be kept from the thought of having everyone else figured out. "To be prepared to forgive means moving from "why me?", to "why them?""&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* '''forgiving yourself&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theforgivenessproject.com/forgiving-yourself|title=Forgiving yourself|work=The Forgiveness Project|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

It is very difficult to forgive others when you haven't had acceptance for your own faults. By putting an end to punishing yourself for things you have or haven't done is just one step closer to self-forgiveness. "It's about letting go of regret and self-pity, and becoming more aware of yourself without being overwhelmed by what you find. Forgiving yourself is an act of self-healing."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* '''developing empathy'''&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theforgivenessproject.com/developing-empathy|title=Developing empathy|work=The Forgiveness Project|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who forgive have a boarder understanding of human behavior. By forgiving you are showing empathy; standing in someone else's shoes, and broadening your perspective on other peoples beliefs and ideas. "Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, author of Zero Degrees of Empathy, has described empathy as "a skill like any human skill", and lack of empathy "a disability" which isn’t permanent and which, if you get a chance to practice, can "get better"."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

* '''seeking revenge&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theforgivenessproject.com/seeking-revenge|title=Seeking revenge|work=The Forgiveness Project|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

Forgiveness further allows us to improve our ability to transform the impulse to seek revenge and allows us to look for the bigger meaning in all of it. "Anger and bitterness towards those who have shamed or wronged you can lead to some people wanting to take revenge. However while thoughts of revenge and retaliation may initially bring relief, they can quickly become obsessive and ultimately deeply destructive. Repetitive revenge fantasies can actually increase someone’s torment and even turn the victim into the aggressor." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

* '''transforming hate'''&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theforgivenessproject.com/transforming-hate|title=Transforming hate|work=The Forgiveness Project|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Forgiveness in this sense is an act of surrender which may mean relinquishing your justified right to retaliate, giving up your moral indignation, or letting go of grievances, grudges and resentments."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; When you start recognizing a common humanity in all people you start to come out of your old identity of being the victim because something must be given up to stop holding on to the cycles of hat we all carry.

* '''making meaning'''&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theforgivenessproject.com/making-meaning|title=Making meaning|work=The Forgiveness Project|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy used to harbor resentment and cover up the feelings can be put elsewhere. People have found forgiveness and healing by finding a purpose and pursue the things that really matter to them. Instead of holding in all the suffering they turn it into something meaningful and puts purpose back into their lives.These stories are shared in hope that everyone will have a little forgiveness in there heart with any situation.

The exhibition was described by the charity's founding patron, Anita Roddick [[Anita Roddick]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anitaroddick.com/readmore.php?sid=395 |title=DISPATCH: The F Word Exhibition Hits America |publisher=anitaroddick.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as “truly an education of the human spirit”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soulcircle.typepad.com/soulcircle/the-forgiveness-project.html|title=TFP: The Forgiveness Project; Soul Circle|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exhibition is made up of Storytellers, who engage others and share their traumas in order to help others heal.

===''The Forgiveness Project: Stories for a Vengeful Age'' (book)===
An updated collection of some of the charity's stories which examine the charity's core themes of forgiveness, reconciliation and conflict transformation have been brought together into an illustrated 240-page book. Released in hardback by [[Jessica Kingsley Publishers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jkp.com/usa/the-forgiveness-project.html |title=JKP - The Forgiveness Project: Stories for a Vengeful Age |publisher=jkp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 26 March 2015, the book was written by founder Marina Cantacuzino and includes forewords from patron [[Desmond Tutu]] and [[Alexander McCall Smith]]. It has also been received endorsements from actress [[Emma Thompson]], journalist and news presenter [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]], historian and TV presenter [[Dan Snow]], cultural thinker and founding faculty member of [[The School of Life]] in London, Roman Krznaric, Cambridge University professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], humanitarian and former hostage [[Terry Waite]] and journalist [[Bel Mooney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Forgiveness-Project-Stories-Vengeful/dp/1849055661 |title=Amazon - The Forgiveness Project: Stories for a Vengeful Age |publisher=amazon.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speaker’s Bureau===
The charity believes that hearing someone speak first-hand and being able to ask questions is the most powerful form of story-telling so over 30 of those who share their stories with The Forgiveness Project are also part of the charity’s Speaker’s Bureau. This facility allows schools, prisons, conferences and organisations hiring the F Word exhibition to have one of the featured storytellers on hand to share their experience of forgiveness.

===Annual lecture===
In addition to regular talks, The Forgiveness Project has also hosted five annual lectures to date.

* 2010:  The first annual lecture was delivered by [[Desmond Tutu]] in May 2010 at [[St John's, Smith Square]]. Tutu was joined by Mary Blewitt who lost 50 members of her family in the Rwandan genocide; [[Jo Berry]] whose father was killed in the 1984 [[Brighton hotel bombing]]; and [[Patrick Magee (Irish republican)|Patrick Magee]], the former IRA activist who planted the bomb. The event was chaired by BBC broadcaster [[Edward Stourton (journalist)|Edward Stourton]].
* 2011:  [[Clare Short]] delivered the second annual lecture on ‘No Forgiveness Without Justice’ on 6 October 2011 at [[Union Chapel, Islington]]. Chaired by [[Yasmin Alibhai-Brown]] of The Independent, Clare Short’s lecture was preceded by Colin Parry, who lost his son in the IRA Warrington bomb in 1993, Elizabeth Turner, whose husband was killed while at a business meeting in the World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001, and Bassam Aramin, a Palestinian whose 10-year-old daughter was killed by an Israeli soldier and who is a founding member of [[Combatants for Peace]].
* 2012: Dr [[Gwen Adshead]], forensic psychiatrist at Broadmoor High Security Hospital, who delivered the 2012 lecture at the [[Royal Geographical Society]], supported on stage by [[Marian Partington]] whose sister was murdered by Fred and Rosemary West, [[Erwin James]], the Guardian columnist and former prisoner who has served a life sentence for murder; and Kemal Pervanic, survivor of the notorious Ormaska concentration camp in Bosnia.
* 2013: [[Simon Baron-Cohen|Professor Simon Baron-Cohen]] delivered the keynote speech on ‘Zero degrees of empathy: exploring explanations of human cruelty and kindness’ at the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. The lecture, chaired by [[Simon Fanshawe]], was followed by a panel discussion with Marina Cantacuzino, Mary Foley, whose 15-year-old daughter Charlotte was murdered during a birthday party in East London in 2005, and Peter Woolf, a reformed career criminal.
* 2017: 7th Annual lecture delivered by [[Richard Holloway]] October, 11 2017 at [[The Royal Geographical Society]], chaired by Shani Chakrabarti. The Lecture "The Politics of Forgiveness" was about the complexity of Forgiveness.

===RESTORE programme===
RESTORE is the charity’s intensive, group-based victim empathy programme for offenders that encourages the sharing of experiences within a framework influenced by [[Restorative Justice]] principles. The project has delivered over 160 programmes in custodial and non-custodial settings in England and Wales since 2007.

Over nine years in the judicial system: The Restore Programme has helped over 3,ooo people including 180 Prison Officers.

Co-facilitated by trained victims of crime and ex-offenders, the workshop leaders use their personal testimonies to encourage prisoners to take responsibility for their actions and change how they think and feel about their offending behaviour.

====Link between RESTORE and restorative justice====
Whilst Restorative Justice (RJ) traditionally focuses on bringing a victim and offender into communication, this process can be stalled if both parties aren’t at the same life stage. The Forgiveness Project’s approach is to help offenders unravel their own stories and develop empathy by understanding the effect their actions have on others. This enables them to start the restorative process without being entirely dependent on their victim’s willingness or availability to participate.

In many cases, having encouraged behavioural change, the programme may result in the offender having the confidence, motivation and support to meet their victims as part of future RJ conferencing. RESTORE assists in victims’ recovery by enabling them to play a role in the criminal justice system.

== Recognition ==

===Awards and commendations===
The organization has won recognition such as: 
* [[Longford Prize]]: In 2007, the charity received a ‘Special Commendation’ from the Longford Prize judges, awarded for its ‘remarkable work’ in exploring and encouraging notions of forgiveness through grassroots projects, including in prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.longfordtrust.org/prize_details.php?id=7 |title=Longford Prize Winners |date=23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Robin Corbett, Baron Corbett of Castle Vale|Robin Corbett Award]]:  In February 2014, the charity was highly commended by the Robin Corbett Award for Prisoner Rehabilitation 2014 for its involvement of trained former offenders, victims of crime and prison staff in the delivery of its group-based RESTORE programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/PressPolicy/News/vw/1/ItemID/204 |title=Manx and Welsh restorative schemes win prisoner rehabilitation award; Prison Reform Trust |date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-26018864 |title=Manx prisoner rehabilitation scheme wins national award; BBC |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The runner-up prize of £1,000 was presented by Lady Corbett and [[David Ramsbotham, Baron Ramsbotham|Lord Ramsbotham]] at the [[House of Lords]] in Westminster.

Cantacuzino received a 2013 [[Winston Churchill Memorial Trusts|Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Travelling Fellowship]] which enabled her to spend five weeks visiting and learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcmt.org.uk/images/stories/press/13%20cantacuzino,%20marina.pdf |title=Can restorative justice reduce reoffending; Winston Churchill Trust |date=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; from other restorative justice programmes in custodial and community settings in the USA and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/GetInvolved/CompetitionsAwards/WinstonChurchillMemorialTrust |title=Winston Churchill Memorial Trust - apply now for a prison and penal reform fellowship; Prison Reform Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research and evaluation===
Independent evaluation was commissioned on the work of RESTORE within prisons and the effect that it has had on young offenders and adult prisoners who had participated in the programme.

* 2009: In 2009, Lois Edmund, Ph.D., C.Psych., Associate Professor of Conflict Resolution Studies, [[University of Winnipeg]], conducted a qualitative assessment based on the first 18 months of The Forgiveness Project’s operations in prison. The report concluded that RESTORE ‘results in dramatic insight for many participants’, but ‘further work is needed to evaluate the long-term learnings of the participants’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theforgivenessproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TFP-Report-2009.pdf |title=The Forgiveness Project - Activity Report; University of Winnipeg |date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2012: To back up The Forgiveness Project's assertion that its work consistently demonstrates a shift in offenders’ motivation to change the charity commissioned an independent evaluation of RESTORE from the Forensic Psychological Services at [[Middlesex University]]. The evaluation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theforgivenessproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Executive-Summary-Evaluation-of-RESTORE-by-FPS-Middlesex-University.pdf |title=Evaluation of The Forgiveness Project RESTORE Prison Programme; Middlesex University |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the intervention reduces recidivism and that those who completed the programme had improved general attitudes to offending, were less likely to anticipate re-offending, and less likely to evaluate crime as worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/9401/ |title=Evaluation of The Forgiveness Project within prisons; Middlesex University Research Repository |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2013: The Forgiveness Project carried out extensive work at Ashfield Young Offenders Institute in Bristol where, with funding from the Home Office’s Communities Against Gangs, Guns and Knives Fund, it was able to embed its RESTORE work into the fabric of the prison. In a report of this programme by cultural scientist Christian Straub, a member of the prison staff described RESTORE as “very powerful” because it “delivered a strong message gently”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theforgivenessproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Evaluation-Report-YOI-Ashfield.pdf |title=Embedding RESTORE into the fabric of YOI Ashfield; Christina Straub MA |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patrons and supporters===

Since [[Anita Roddick|Dame Anita Roddick]] first lent her support in advance of the inaugural ''The F Word'' exhibition in 2004, The Forgiveness Project has attracted endorsements and ongoing support from a number of high-profile organisations and individuals.

The charity’s patrons include [[Desmond Tutu|Archbishop Desmond Tutu]], [[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Rt Hon the Lord Woolf]], philanthropist Lady Edwina Grosvenor, actress [[Emma Thompson]] and comedian [[Shappi Khorsandi]] whilst supporters include [[Tony Benn]], clothes designer [[Katharine Hamnett]], actors [[Helen Mirren|Dame Helen Mirren]] and [[Linus Roache]] plus [[Terry Waite]].

The Forgiveness Project is also a peace partner of the Charter for Compassion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://charterforcompassion.org/node/6625 |title=Peace Partner - peace starts here; Charter for Compassion |date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Historical Atlas of China''''' ({{zh|t=中國歷史地圖集|s=中国历史地图集|first=t|p=Zhōngguó lìshǐ dìtú jí}}) is an 8-volume work published in [[Beijing]] between 1982 and 1988, edited by [[Tan Qixiang]]. It contains 304 maps and 70,000 placenames in total.
The ''Concise Historical Atlas of China'' ({{zh|s=简明中国歷史地图集|p=Jiǎnmíng Zhōngguó lìshǐ dìtú jí}}) was published in 1991.

== Contents ==

The atlas consists of 8 volumes:
# Archaeological findings, [[Xia dynasty|Xia]], [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] dynasties and [[Zhou dynasty]] ([[Western Zhou]], [[Spring and Autumn period]] and [[Warring States period]])
# [[Qin dynasty]], [[Western Han dynasty|Western]] and [[Eastern Han dynasty|Eastern Han]] dynasties
# [[Three Kingdoms]] and [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Western Jin dynasty]]
# [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Eastern Jin dynasty]], [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]
# [[Sui dynasty]], [[Tang dynasty]] and [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]
# [[Song dynasty]], [[Liao dynasty]] and [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin Empire]]
# [[Yuan dynasty]] and [[Ming dynasty]]
# [[Qing dynasty]]
On each map, ancient places and water features are shown in black and blue respectively, superimposed on modern features, borders and claims, shown in brown.
All country-wide maps, from [[Paleolithic]] onward, include an inset showing the [[Nine-Dash Line]] in the [[South China Sea]].
Placenames are given in [[simplified characters]], though an edition of the atlas published in Hong Kong uses [[traditional characters]].{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=245}}

== Reception ==
The ''Atlas'' is considered the most authoritative compendium of ancient place names and administrative boundaries, and a tremendous improvement on its predecessor, [[Yang Shoujing]]'s ''Lidai yudi tu'' (''Yangtu'', "Yang's atlas", 1906–1911).{{sfnp|McColl|1992|p=362}}{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|pp=245–246}}
However, more controversial has been Tan's historical conception:{{sfnp|Kallio|2011|p=22}}
{{quote|When the Qing dynasty had succeeded in unifying the country by the 1750s [...] the historical development of several millennia towards establishing China's territorial extent had been completed. All those nationalities which have lived within that territory are historically Chinese nationalities, and all the political entities established by these nationalities are historical parts of China.|Tan Qixiang|"General Compiling Principles", ''The Historical Atlas of China''}}
This vision has been criticized as anachronistically projecting 20th-century minority policy and border claims into the distant past, resulting in a distorted view of the history of peripheral areas, portraying their incorporation into China as an inevitable organic process, rather than the result of conquest.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|pp=245–246}}
Similarly, early states are often given overly precise and extensive outer borders, often based on contentious claims.{{sfnp|Terrill|2003|p=197}}{{sfnp|Black|2000|pp=193–194}}
In his afterword to volume 8, written in 1987, Tan regretted expanding the borders of Chinese empires to encompass ''[[Jimi system|jimi]]'' and ''[[tusi]]'' regimes.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=246}}

"'''Tower of London'''" is the first episode of the award-winning [[United Kingdom|British]] [[comedy]] television series ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]''.

This episode is also known as "'''''Beefeaters'''''" and as "'''''The Tower of London'''''".

The episode was written by all three members of The Goodies.

==Plot==
Bill, Graeme and Tim have decided to run their own agency. Using Tim's inheritance, Graeme has made a modern high-tech residence/office that contains various features such as a fully stocked supermarket, a high-tech computer and a picture window that can show various images when the blinds close. Delighted with the new office (aside from the lack of a phone for which they utilize an old lady downstairs), they set to work on promoting their business, which isn't exactly clear to any of them, considering their marketing catch-phrase "''Anything, anytime''" is too vague.

Bill, who was in charge of advertising their agency, has put advertisements into various  magazines and newspapers.  Graeme comments that Bill is casting the net a bit wide.  Bill replies that he does not know what they (the Goodies) do.  Tim comments that they were "going to do...good to....people" &amp;mdash; to which Bill responds "''How wet!''".

The Goodies are almost immediately summoned to the [[Tower of London]], where they meet the [[Yeomen Warders|Chief Beefeater]] in the kitchens of the Tower (renovated from a disused torture chamber). He tells them that somebody is stealing the Beefeaters' beef and, as a result, the Beefeaters are starving as they refuse to eat anything else and are now only 3 feet tall. The Chief Beefeater asks the Goodies to find out who is stealing the beef and why.

Back at their office, the Goodies attempt to solve the mystery by suggesting "bulls or poultry farmers" as the conspirators. However, Bill has a mental image (a strange effect from sucking on lemon sherbert) of a [[pictogram]] revealing that someone is starving the Beefeaters in order to steal the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]]. They are called back to the Tower (disguised as Beefeaters) by the Chief Beefeater where they discover that the last remaining Beefeaters have perished "from the lack of beef".

The Goodies get to work, setting up an elaborate security system protecting the Crown Jewels from attempted robbery. Soon after, they catch a burglar who, strangely enough, bears an official royal seal that reads "by appointment". As the Chief Beefeater interrogates the burglar, the Goodies spot a man on a horse outside the Tower who appears to resemble [[Prince Charles]]. Believing him to be an imposter and accomplice to the robbery, they go on a wild chase throughout London. When he escapes into Buckingham Palace, they realize that it was indeed Prince Charles.

Later, as the Goodies wallow in their shame, they receive a message from the Queen herself. She explains how the Goodies were actually protecting a fake set of Jewels as the real ones were pawned "due to a recent financial embarrassment". The Goodies had mistakenly foiled an attempt to put the real Crown Jewels back. They are let off the hook for their noble actions and are requested to treat the embarrassing incident as a secret. Still in business and safe from jail, the Goodies rejoice.

In [[linguistics]], a '''VO language''' is a language in which the [[verb]] typically comes before the [[object (grammar)|object]],&lt;ref Name="Trips"&gt;{{cite book

For example, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] would be considered an [[OV language]], and [[English language|English]] would be considered to be VO. A basic sentence demonstrating this would be as follows.

:Japanese: Inu ga ''neko'' (object) o '''oikaketa''' (verb)
:English: The dog '''chased''' (verb) the ''cat'' (object)

[[Winfred P. Lehmann]] is the first to propose the reduction of the six possible permutations of word order to just two main ones, VO and OV, in what he calls the Fundamental Principle of Placement (FPP), arguing that the subject is not a primary element of a sentence. VO languages are primarily right-branching, or head-initial: [[head (linguistics)|head]]s are generally found at the beginning of their [[phrase]]s.

VO languages have a tendency to favor the use of [[prepositions]] instead of postpositions, with only 42 using postpositions of the documented 498 VO languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Atlas of Language Structures Online|url=http://wals.info/feature/95A?tg_format=map&amp;v1=c00d&amp;v2=c99f&amp;v3=cd00&amp;v4=cf6f&amp;v5=cccc|work=Map 95A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some languages, such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], use both VO and OV constructions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; but in other instances, such as [[Middle English|Early Middle English]], some dialects may use VO and others OV. Languages that contain both OV and VO construction may solidify into one or the other construction. A language that moves the verb or [[verb phrase]] more than the object will have surface VO word order, and a language that moves the object more than the verb or verb phrase will have surface OV word order.

The '''Watauga Association''' (sometimes referred to as the '''Republic of Watauga''') was a semi-autonomous government created in 1772 by frontier settlers living along the [[Watauga River]] in what is now [[Elizabethton, Tennessee]].  Although it lasted only a few years, the Watauga Association provided a basis for what later developed into the state of Tennessee and likely influenced other western frontier governments in the [[Appalachia|trans-Appalachian]] region. [[North Carolina]] annexed the Watauga settlement area, by then known as the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]], in November 1776. Within a year, the area was placed under a county government, becoming Washington County, North Carolina, in November 1777.&lt;ref name=williams1&gt;Samuel Cole Williams, ''William Tatham, Wataugan'' (Johnson City, Tenn.: The Watauga Press, 1947), pp. 11–28.&lt;/ref&gt; (This is the present day [[Washington County, Tennessee|Washington County]], [[Carter County, Tennessee|Carter County]] and other areas now located in the northeast part of the state of [[Tennessee]].)

While there is no evidence that the Watauga Association ever claimed to be outside the sovereign territory of the British Crown, historians have often cited the Association as the earliest attempt by American-born colonists to form an independent democratic government.  In 1774, [[Virginia]] governor [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]] called the Watauga Association a "dangerous example" of Americans forming a government "distinct from and independent of his majesty's authority."&lt;ref name=williams2&gt;Samuel Cole Williams, "The Admission of Tennessee Into the Union."  ''Tennessee Historical Quarterly'' Vol. IV, no. 4 (December 1945), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;  President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] later wrote that the Watauga settlers were the "first men of American birth to establish a free and independent community on the continent."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Fink, "Some Phases of the History of the State of Franklin."  ''Tennessee Historical Quarterly'' Vol. XVI, no. 3 (1957), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;  While no copy of the settlers' compact, known as the ''Articles of the Watauga Association'', has ever been found, related documents tend to imply that the Watauga settlers still considered themselves British subjects, even after the initial hostilities of the American Revolution had commenced.&lt;ref name="dickinson"/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:TNMap-doton-Elizabethton.PNG|left|thumb|240px|Location of the Watauga settlement on modern map of Tennessee]]

European settlers began arriving in the [[Watauga River|Watauga]], [[Nolichucky River|Nolichucky]], and [[Holston River|Holston]] river valleys in the late 1760s and early 1770s, most migrating from Virginia via the Great Valley, although a few were believed to have been Regulators fleeing North Carolina after their defeat at the [[Battle of Alamance]].  These settlers mistakenly believed (or at least claimed to have believed) the Watauga and Nolichucky valleys were part of lands ceded to Virginia by the Cherokee in the 1770 [[Treaty of Lochaber]], but a subsequent survey by Colonel [[John Donelson]] confirmed that these lands were still part of the Cherokee domain.  As settlement on lands west of colonial boundaries violated the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], the Watauga and Nolichucky settlers were ordered to leave.&lt;ref name=finger1&gt;John Finger, ''Tennessee Frontiers: Three Regions in Transition'' (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2001), pp. 43–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1772, the Watauga and Nolichucky settlers negotiated a 10-year lease directly with the [[Cherokee]], and being outside the claims of any colony, established the Watauga Association to provide basic government functions.  The lease and the subsequent purchase of these lands in 1775 were considered illegal by the British Crown, and were vehemently opposed by a growing faction of the Cherokee led by the young chief [[Dragging Canoe]].  With the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (April 1775), the settlers organized themselves into the "Washington District," loyal to the "united colonies," and formed a [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]] to govern it, marking the end of the so-called "Watauga Republic".

In Spring of 1776, the Washington District Committee of Safety drafted a petition asking the colony of Virginia to annex the district.  After Virginia refused, the Committee drafted a similar petition (dated July 5, 1776) asking the North Carolina Assembly to annex the district.  In November of that year, North Carolina granted the petition and formally annexed the area. The Washington District was finally admitted to North Carolina as Washington County in November 1777.

The Cherokee, who were aligned with the British, launched an all-out invasion against the settlements in July 1776, but were soundly defeated.&lt;ref name=finger1 /&gt; In 1777, the Cherokee signed the Treaty of Long Island, ceding control of the Watauga and Nolichucky valleys to the American colonies.&lt;ref name=finger2&gt;Finger, pp. 66–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
{{Wikisourcepar|Watauga Petition}}

Since no copy of the ''Articles of the Watauga Association'' has ever been found, most of what is known about it comes from other sources, primarily the 1776 ''Petition of the Inhabitants of the Washington District'', commonly called the "Watauga Petition," in which the Wataugans requested annexation by North Carolina.  According to the Petition, the ''Articles'' were fashioned after the laws of Virginia and were enacted by unanimous consent of the settlers.  The primary reason given for the establishment of the Watauga Association was to prevent the Watauga and Nolichucky regions from becoming a haven for debtors and felons, and for conducting "public business" such as the recording of deeds and wills.  Other sources, such as the later writings of Washington District Committee of Safety clerk ''pro tem'' William Tatham (1752&amp;ndash;1819) and documents collected by historian [[J. G. M. Ramsey]] in the mid-19th century, reveal that the ''Articles'' established a five-member court (the members of which were elected), and that the Wataugans erected a courthouse and jail at [[Sycamore Shoals]].&lt;ref name=williams4&gt;Samuel Cole Williams, ''Dawn of Tennessee Valley and Tennessee History'' (Johnson City, Tenn.: Watauga Press, 1937), pp. 370–377.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians disagree over the first five magistrates of the court, although most agree that it included John Carter, [[James Robertson (explorer)|James Robertson]], Charles Robertson, and Zachariah Isbell.  The fifth member was probably Jacob Brown.  Later court members included Andrew Greer, John Roddye, and [[John Sevier]].  James Smith was probably the court's first clerk, replaced by Sevier in 1775.  When Sevier was elected to the court, [[Felix Walker (American politician)|Felix Walker]] took over as clerk, with Tatham serving in his absence.&lt;ref name=williams4 /&gt;

==Military affairs==
Wataugan militiamen were present at multiple engagements on the frontier and throughout the American Revolution.  A company of 20 Wataugans took part in the [[Battle of Point Pleasant]] in 1774 during [[Lord Dunmore's War]], and another contingent aided in the defense of [[Boonesborough, Kentucky|Boonesborough]] and [[Harrodsburg, Kentucky|Harrodsburg]] later in the decade.&lt;ref&gt;Finger, pp. 48, 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Washington District Committee of Safety, created in 1775, consisted of John Carter, Zachariah Isbell, Jacob Brown, John Sevier, James Smith, James and Charles Robertson, [[William Bean]], John Jones, George Russell, and Robert Lucas.  The Committee acquired arms and oversaw the construction of [[Fort Watauga]] (initially named Fort Caswell and located at present day [[Elizabethton, Tennessee]]), where they thwarted one wing of the Cherokee invasion of July 1776.  Wataugans took part in [[William Christian (Virginia)|William Christian]]'s punitive expedition and the [[Rutherford Light Horse expedition]] against the [[Overhill Cherokee|Overhill]] towns in the latter half of 1776.&lt;ref name=finger2 /&gt;

Even at the height of the Cherokee threat in the Spring and Summer of 1776, the Wataugans heeded a call to arms and dispatched a company of riflemen under Felix Walker to aide in the [[Siege of Charleston|defense of Charleston]] in South Carolina.&lt;ref name=williams1 /&gt;  In August 1780, a small contingent led by [[Isaac Shelby|Col. Isaac Shelby]] fought in the American Patriot victory at the [[Battle of Musgrove Mill]] near present-day [[Clinton, South Carolina]].  In late September 1780, the [[Overmountain Men]]&amp;mdash;the frontier militia that crossed the Appalachian Mountains and defeated an army of British [[loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]]s at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]]&amp;mdash;mustered at Sycamore Shoals, and included 240 Wataugans under the command of Cols. John Sevier and Isaac Shelby.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Alderman, ''Overmountain Men'' (Johnson City, Tenn.: Overmountain Press, 1970), pp. 81–96.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the battle, Sevier led a second punitive expedition against the Cherokee in which he destroyed the [[Chickamauga Cherokee]] villages near modern [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].

At least one Wataugan, William Tatham, was present at the [[Siege of Yorktown|Battle of Yorktown]] in 1781.&lt;ref name=williams1 /&gt;

==Legacy==
The ''Articles of the Watauga Association'' likely influenced the [[Cumberland Compact]] (drafted in 1780), the main link between the two pacts being James Robertson, who in 1779 led a group of colonists into what is now the [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] area.  The Clarksville Compact, drafted for the [[Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville]] settlement in 1785, may have also been inspired by the Watauga Association (the Clarksville Compact even adopted the laws of Virginia, even though the settlement was clearly within the territory of North Carolina).  In the mid-1780s, some former Wataugans (especially John Sevier) played a key role in the establishment of the failed [[State of Franklin]].&lt;ref name=williams3&gt;Samuel Cole Williams, "The Clarksville Compact."  ''Tennessee Historical Quarterly'' Vol. 3, no. 3 (1944), pp. 237–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous historians in the 19th and early 20th centuries romanticized the Watauga Association as the first democratic or constitutional government formed by American-born colonists.  Historian [[Andrew C. McLaughlin]], in his first major work on the history of the U.S. Constitution, wrote of the Wataugans, "one can find no more striking fact in American history, nor one more typical, than the simple ease with which those frontiersmen ... formed an association and extended the rights and privileges of self-government."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Cole Williams, ''Dawn of Tennessee Valley'', p. 370n.  Williams cites McLaughlin's ''Confederation and the Constitution'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  McLaughlin's colleague [[Claude H. Van Tyne|Claude Van Tyne]] wrote of the Wataugans, "like the Pilgrim Fathers they were without formal laws and institutions, and they made them."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Cole Williams, ''Dawn of Tennessee Valley'', p. 370n.  Williams cites Van Tyne's ''The New West'', p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''The Winning of the West'', Theodore Roosevelt treated the Watauga Association as a microcosm of the subsequent American Revolution, writing, "the Watauga settlers outlined in advance the nation's work.  They tamed the rugged and shaggy wilderness, they bid defiance to outside foes, and they successfully solved the difficult problem of self-government."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Cole Williams, ''Dawn of Tennessee Valley'', p. 370n.  Williams cites Roosevelt's ''The Winning of the West'' Vol. 1, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent historians point out that while the Watauga Association was one of the first constitutional governments west of the Appalachians, it was not intended as a government separate from the English colonies.&lt;ref name="dickinson"&gt;W. Calvin Dickinson, [https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/watauga-association/ "Watauga Association"]; ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'' (2002);  Retrieved: 24 May, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finger, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;
