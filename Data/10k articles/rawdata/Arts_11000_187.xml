==Investigative journalism career==
[[File:Amy Goodman.jpg|thumb|Goodman speaking at Power to the Peaceful Festival, San Francisco 2004]]
In 1991, covering the [[History of East Timor|East Timor independence movement]], Goodman and fellow journalist [[Allan Nairn]] reported that they were badly beaten by [[Indonesian soldiers]] after witnessing a [[Mass murder|mass killing]] of Timorese demonstrators in what became known as the [[Santa Cruz Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.democracynow.org/1997/11/12/massacre_the_story_of_east_timor "Massacre: The Story of East Timor"], ''Democracy Now!'', November 12, 1997. Retrieved January 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Goodman and journalist [[Jeremy Scahill]] (later a founding editor of ''[[The Intercept]]'', along with [[Glenn Greenwald]] and [[Laura Poitras]]) documented [[Chevron Corporation]]'s role in a confrontation between the [[Nigerian Army]] and villagers who had seized oil rigs and other equipment belonging to oil corporations.

Chevron Corp.|Parabe]] oil platform, which had been occupied by villagers who accused the company of contaminating their land. Soon after landing, the Nigerian military shot and killed two of the protesters, Jola Ogungbeje and Aroleka Irowaninu, and wounded 11 others. Chevron spokesperson Sola Omole acknowledged that the company transported the troops, and that use of troops was at the request of Chevron's management. The documentary, ''[[Drilling and Killing: Chevron and Nigeria's Oil Dictatorship]]'', won the [[George Polk Award]] in 1998.

===''Democracy Now!''===
{{Main|Democracy Now!}}

Goodman had been news director of [[Pacifica Radio]] station [[WBAI]] in New York City for over a decade when she co-founded ''Democracy Now! The War and Peace Report'' in 1996. Since then, ''Democracy Now!'' has been called "probably the most significant progressive news institution that has come around in some time" by professor and media critic [[Robert W. McChesney|Robert McChesney]].&lt;ref name="thenation.com"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050523/ratner |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209131047/http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050523/ratner |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 9, 2012 |title=Amy Goodman's 'Empire' |last=Ratner |first=Lizzy |work=The Nation |date=May 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the show was temporarily pulled off the air, as a result of a conflict with a group of Pacifica Radio board members and Pacifica staff members and listeners. During that time, it moved to a converted firehouse from which it broadcast until November 13, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Block|first=Jennifer|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2002/01/15/a-dose-of-democracy-now/|website=The Village Voice|title=A Dose of Democracy, Now: WBAI Listeners Get Their Station Back|date=January 15, 2002|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Democracy Now!'' subsequently moved to a studio located in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2009/11/page/2/ Andy Worthington Archive for November 2009].

In September 2016, Goodman covered the [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests]] in [[Morton County, North Dakota]]; footage from her reporting "showed security personnel pepper-spraying and siccing attack dogs on demonstrators."&lt;ref name="CNNMoney"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last= Kludt|title=Judge rules against riot charge for "Democracy Now!" host Amy Goodman|publisher=CNN Money|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/17/media/amy-goodman-riot-charge-north-dakota/|date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Democracy Now!'' aired the footage, Goodman was charged by state prosecutor Ladd Erickson first with criminal trespass and, after that charge was dismissed, with [[riot]],&lt;ref name="CNNMoney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ratnerthenationisfacingprison"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ratner|first1=Lizzy|title=Amy Goodman Is Facing Prison for Reporting on the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Goodman turned herself in to Morton County on October 17, saying that she would be fighting the charges against her as a "clear violation" of the [[First Amendment]], which guarantees [[Freedom of the press in the United States|freedom of the press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/10/13/media_advisory_journalist_amy_goodman_to|title=MEDIA ADVISORY: Journalist Amy Goodman to Turn Herself in to North Dakota Authorities|last=|first=|date=October 13, 2016|website=Democracy Now!|publisher=|access-date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodman was supported by the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], which issued a statement saying: "This arrest warrant is a transparent attempt to intimidate reporters from covering protests of significant public interest.

'''Archimede construction systems''' are [[construction]] techniques achieving [[Rhombic dodecahedron|rhombic dodecahedral]] shapes, a [[space-filling geometry]]. In America, most of these systems generate [[building envelope]]s made up of as little as two panel shapes and sizes, this feature allowing for maximum [[industrialization]]. These panels are generally pressure injected with a rigid structural [[insulating foam]] like [[polyurethane]]. In [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], post and beam structure often create a dodecahedral shape that is later filled with different [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]] materials. Although the basic [[geometry]] sometimes contains an entire house, most applications of the system are an agglomeration of cells each forming a rhombic dodecahedral living space that can be a room or a larger living area when combined with adjacent dodecahedral modules.

'''History''' The peculiar three-dimensional structure of the [[honey bee]] comb has intrigued for thousands of years. It is quite possible that some isolated construction project used a scaled-up version of this [[zonohedron]], however a largely visible use of these shapes only appeared in the early 1980s. 
Les Systèmes Archimede Inc. of Tring Junction QC started to produce applying US4462191, a patent owned by J. Poirier who also co-founded the manufacturing firm with [[Placide Poulin]]  .&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com.mx/patents/US4462191?dq=jacques+b+poirier&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cImTU_ncNY6BogTjuYCgBQ&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA Prefabricated dwelling of the modular type]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16872">The '''architecture of Taiwan''' can be traced back to [[stilt house|stilt housing]] of the aborigines in [[prehistory|prehistoric times]]; to the building of fortresses and churches in the north and south used to colonize and convert the inhabitants during the [[Dutch Taiwan|Dutch]] and [[Spanish Taiwan|Spanish]] period; the [[Kingdom of Tungning|Tungning]] period when Taiwan was a base of [[anti-Qing sentiment]] and Minnan-style architecture was introduced; in [[Qing dynasty]] period, a mix of Chinese and Western architecture appeared and [[artillery battery]] flourished during Qing's [[Self-Strengthening Movement]]; During the [[Japanese rule of Taiwan]], the Minnan, [[Japanese culture|Japanese]] and [[Western culture|Western]] culture were main influencers in architectural designs and saw the introduction and use of [[reinforced concrete]]. Due to excessive Westernization as a colony, after the [[Retrocession Day|retrocession of Taiwan]] to the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] in 1945 from Japan at the end of World War II, Chinese classical style became popular and entered into international mainstream as a postmodern design style. Today, Taiwanese architecture has undergone much diversification, every style of architecture can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dm.ncyu.edu.tw/history/history.htm {{zh icon}} History of Taiwanese architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prehistory (-1621) ==
{{Main|Prehistory of Taiwan}}
The architecture of prehistoric Taiwan saw structures ranging from [[cave|cave dwellings]], [[stilt house|stilt housing]], to [[stone masonry]]. Primarily of [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.wunan.com.tw/download/preview/1wb5.pdf {{zh icon}} Pre-historic Taiwanese architecture, National Chiayi University - Dead link]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Cave Dwelling===
Prehistoric man made use of caves for their dwellings and Taiwan's oldest known civilization is the [[Changbin culture]] (長濱文化) dating back to over 50,000 years. An example of an [[archaeological site]] of a cave dwelling is the [[Bashian Caves]] in [[Changbin, Taitung|Changbin Township]], [[Taitung County]] which is dated from between 5,500 and 30,000 years. The actual cave itself has a height of around ten [[metre|meters]] and can accommodate some ten persons.

===Stilt Housing===
{{Main|Stilt house}}
Spread over the vast prehistoric [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Indian Ocean]] areas, stilt houses vary greatly. In more recent times, Taiwanese aborigines make use of them for holding church meetings, as places to cool down and to hold ancestral activities. Apart from their cooling effect, stilt houses also have various functions such as avoiding [[miasma theory|miasma]], dampness, flood, and insects and snakes from entering, it is also easier to construct.

===Stone Slab Housing===
[[File:Paiwan.jpg|right|thumb|Stone slab house of the [[Paiwan people|Paiwan tribe]] taken by Japanese anthropologist [[Ushinosuke Mori]] prior to 1945.]]

The [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] and [[Bunun people|Bunun]] tribes made houses using thatched roofing and made walls from stones, homes of nobles were decorated with elaborate wood carvings. The special characteristics of such houses is that dark colored building materials help conceal the buildings in its environment and the layered use of rocks mimic the scales of the [[Deinagkistrodon|hundred pacer snake]] that they worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-tribe.org.tw/kungdavane/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabId=100 {{zh icon}} Kungdavane - Dead link]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aboriginal Architecture===
{{Main|Taiwanese aborigines}}
Chinese and aborigines made use of natural materials for basic construction materials such as straw, wood, bamboo, grass, stone, soil, etc. The types and styles vary depending on the environment, climate, and cultural influences of each tribe. For example, the [[Amis people|Amis]] tribe tend to live in larger communities and planned the layout of their community such as placement of communal homes and a plaza for matters of governance inside, planting a bamboo forest around the outside with camps and guard stations to defend against foreign aggressors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmtip.gov.tw/Aborigines/Article.aspx?CategoryID=3&amp;ClassID=10&amp;TypeID=24&amp;SubTypeID=0&amp;RaceID=1 {{zh icon}} Building structures of the Amis tribe, Digital Museum of Taiwan Indigenous Peoples]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Atayal people|Atayal]] and [[Saisiyat people|Saisiyat]] tribes made their homes out of wood and bamboo while the [[Tao people|Tao]] tribe who live further away on [[Orchid Island]] and faced strong changes in seasonal weather such as typhoons, developed houses that made use of digging vertically into the ground to strengthen their foundations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmtip.gov.tw/Aborigines/Article.aspx?CategoryID=3&amp;ClassID=10&amp;TypeID=24&amp;SubTypeID=2&amp;RaceID=12 {{zh icon}} Housing layout of the Yami (Tao) tribe, Digital Museum of Taiwan Indigenous Peoples]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The [[16th century]] was a time of Western naval navigation, exploration and trade and also the shifting of power from the [[Ming dynasty]] to the [[Qing dynasty]]. Most of the architecture in Taiwan from this period were dominated by fortresses, primarily the Dutch Fengguiwei Fort (風櫃尾城), [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]], [[Fort Provintia]] in the south and the Spanish [[Fort San Domingo]] to the north. The Dutch used red bricks in construction while the Spanish used stone. Both sides made use of ports and constructed fortresses to consolidate their power on the island. The fortresses were square shaped with an additional side for the installment of [[artillery]]. This period saw Taiwan architecture enter the peak of [[western culture|Western colonization]]. Such structures from this period represent the first generation of architectural works and is now listed as a world heritage by the Republic of China government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dm.ncyu.edu.tw/vr/vr02_map/001/001-02.htm {{zh icon}} Origins of Tamsui's Fort Zeelandia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Braganza Brooch''' is a gold ornamental [[fibula (brooch)|fibula]] that was made in the third century BC by a Greek craftsman for an Iberian client.  Since its discovery in unknown circumstances in the nineteenth century, it has belonged to a variety of owners before being purchased by the [[British Museum]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=467441&amp;partId=1&amp;people=31892&amp;peoA=31892-3-18&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;.

==Description==
This heavy gold brooch is dominated by the figure of a naked warrior who wears a [[Celts|Celtic]] helmet and protects himself with a Celtic shield and sword from a hunting dog which jumps up to him. Each end of the fibula is decorated by a dog's head and it once furnished a spring and pin which is now lost. The form, style and technique suggest that it was made in the third century BC by a Greek jeweller for a Celtic patron who lived on the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Contemporary Iberian brooches were usually made of silver and were often decorated with warriors on horseback accompanied by hunting dogs. In this unique gold version, the craftsman has simplified the hunting scene and added a boar's head, which once served as the sliding catch for the now missing pin. The brooch measures approximately 14&amp;nbsp;cm long.

==Ownership of the Brooch==
The brooch was once in the collection of the Royal [[House of Braganza]] and was perhaps collected by [[Fernando II of Portugal|Fernando II]], consort of Queen Maria of Portugal. Most of the jewellery of the Braganza dynasty was inherited in 1919 by HRH Nevada of Portugal, Princess d'Braganza and Duchesse d'Oporto who later emigrated to America. On her death in 1941, the collection was sold to Warren Piper of Chicago. The brooch was in turn purchased by Thomas F Flannery Jr in 1950. After being loaned to the British Museum for 7 years, it was purchased by the museum in 2001.

The '''Church of Spiritual Technology''' ('''CST''') is a [[California]] 501(c)(3) [[non-profit corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:IRS-Recognition-Denmark.djvu|Letter by the Internal Revenue Service to Flemming Paludan, Regional Director, Danish Tax-Office, Washington, D.C., USA, December 22nd, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; incorporated in 1982, which owns all the [[copyright]]s of the estate of [[L.

In a 1993 memorandum by the [[Church of Scientology International]], the role and function of CST has been described as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] CST [...] is an autonomous church of the Scientology religion outside the international Scientology ecclesiastical hierarchy. CST conducts an extensive program of activities to preserve and archive the Scientology Scriptures for use by future generations. CST also owns the option to acquire RTC's rights to the Scientology advance[d] technology and religious marks under three narrowly defined sets of circumstances, each of which contemplates a serious threat to continued existence of the religion. CST is the principal beneficiary of Mr. Hubbard's estate, provided that it obtains recognition of its tax-exempt status. [...]" &lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Summary Description CST-AT-ASI.pdf|Summary Description of Other Scientology Organizations - CST (Church of Spiritual Technology), Author's Family Trust, ASI (Author Services Inc.) - CSI Prod. 11-4-93, Bate Stamp: 151412 - 151413, Ex. 1-8, Washington, DC 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Corporate information ==

The Church of Spiritual Technology (CST) was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] by Sherman Lenske in Woodland Hills, [[California]] on May 27, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:CST-Incorporation.djvu|Articles of Incorporation of Church of Spiritual Technology, Endorsed Filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of California, Woodland Hills, California, May 27th, 28th &amp; June 1st, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bylaws]] of CST were signed on June 7, 1982 by its General and Special [[Board of directors|Directors]], who were at that time Lyman Spurlock, Rebecca Pook, Maria Starkey, Stephen A. Lenske, Sherman D. Lenske and Lawrence A. Heller.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Bylaws-CST.pdf|Bylaws of Church of Spiritual Technology, California, June 7th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; In 1986, CST's [[Articles of Incorporation]] were amended to clarify the "[[disposition]] of the [[corporation|corporation's]] [[assets]] upon [[dissolution (law)|dissolution]]".&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Amended Articles of Incorporation CST.pdf|Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation - Church of Spiritual Technology, Endorsed filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of California, Bate Stamp: 02008 - 02009, California, April 9th, May 13th &amp; 14th, 1986]]&lt;/ref&gt;'''= --&gt;
On August 18, 1993, CST filed an application for [[tax exemption]] under section [[501(c)(3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;!-- [[:File:Application-501-CST.pdf|Form 1023 - Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code - Church of Spiritual Technology, Washington, DC, August 18th, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; The [[Internal Revenue Service]] granted CST's request for exemption through an official recognition letter on October 1, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:Image:IRS-Recognition-CST.pdf|Recognition Letter for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status - Church of Spiritual Technology, Washington, DC, October 1st, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the filing for [[tax exemption]], the following individuals held [[corporate]] positions at CST: The [[Board of Trustees]] was composed of John Allcock, David Lantz and Russell Bellin. Thomas Vorm, Russell Bellin and Catherine Schmidt formed the [[Board of Directors]]. CST's [[President (corporate title)|President]] was Russell Bellin, its [[Vice-President]] Thomas Vorm, its [[Secretary]] Jane McNairn and its [[Treasurer]] Catherine Schmidt.

===Licensing of trademarks and service marks===
[[File:IRS-CST-Denial-Letter.pdf|thumb|left|July 8, 1988 [[IRS]], final adverse ruling letter with regards to application for tax exempt status of Church of Spiritual Technology]]

The existence and founding of CST is intimately connected to the creation of the [[Religious Technology Center]], which was incorporated on January 1, 1982. Shortly after its inception, RTC received on May 16, 1982 "the ownership, supervision and control" of the [[trademarks]] and [[service marks]], identifying "Scientology applied religious philosophy" and "Dianetics spiritual healing technology" by the originator and founder of Scientology, [[L. Ron Hubbard]] through a so-called "[[Assignment (law)|Assignment]] [[Contract|Agreement]]".&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Assignment-RTC.pdf|"Assignment Agreement (LRH/RTC) (Marks)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Religious Technology Center, County of Los Angeles, California, May 16th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

This agreement was subject to an additional "Option Agreement" between Hubbard, RTC and CST.  In two so-called "Option Agreements" from May 1982, Hubbard granted CST the right to purchase at any time from RTC the "Marks", the "Advanced Technology" and all the rights to them for the sum of $100.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Option-Agreement-LRH-CST.pdf|"Option Agreement (Marks)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Spiritual Technology, County of Los Angeles, California, May 10th, 1982/July 9th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Option-Agreement-LRH-CST-AT.pdf|Option Agreement (Advanced Technology-U.S.) - Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Spiritual Technology, California, May 10th &amp; July 9th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Parallel and similar-sounding agreements between Hubbard, RTC and CST were created during that period concerning the so-called "Advanced Technology," which consists of unpublished derivates of Scientology's confidential "Advanced technology".&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Assignment-Agreement-LRH-RTC-AT.pdf|"Assignment Agreement (LRH/RTC) (Advanced Technology - US)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Religious Technology Center, Los Angeles, California, May 10th &amp; 16th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Under these agreements, RTC is forced to turn over 90% of its net income to CST. A document from 1991, reflecting the "financial money flows" of RTC during the year 1989, actually showed a turnover of 59% of RTC's net income towards CST.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Analysis-Financial-Flows-RTC.pdf|"Religious Technology Center - Analysis of Financial Flows 1989", Exhibit I-9 for Application for Tax-Exempt Status 501(c)(3), Bate Stamp: CSI Prod 11-4-93 151414]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Other examples of [[trademarks]] and [[service marks]] owned by CST are [[The Way to Happiness]] and The Way to Happiness symbol. As such, CST operates as the L. Ron Hubbard Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.twth.org/reprinting/files/reprint-instructions.pdf |format=PDF| title = How to obtain permission to reprint The Way to Happiness booklets | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | publisher = The Way to Happiness Foundation International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facility locations ==
CST operates numerous bases throughout the western United States.  Locations include:

=== Twin Peaks, California ===
As of 1988, this property has 15 buildings totaling approximately 22,000 square ft, including a three-story administration office, dormitories, dining halls, residences and other buildings and offices. The originals are kept here, with copies made for other vault locations. [[Shelly Miscavige]], wife of leader David Miscavige, who hasn't been seen in public since 2007, is said to be held at this location.

=== Creston, California (Creston Ranch / Whispering Winds Ranch) ===
While not a vault location, the Creston Ranch, where L. Ron Hubbard died, is marked with the CST logo.

=== Triple Jay Ranch, California ===

=== Petrolia, California (Sunset View / Eureka) ===
The usage for the property is an archival document storage repository there which will store religious documents preserved by CST.
=== Tuolumne, California (Lady Washington Mine) ===
Located at 18749 First Avenue, Tuolumne serves as archival storage for the writings of L Ron Hubbard.  The Lady Washington Mine and two houses on 26.23 acres were purchased in 1988 by William and Donna Daniels. In 1988, the Daniels gave the property to Norman Starkey, trustee of "Author's Family Trust". Starkey gave the property to the Church of Spiritual Technology in 1993. Digging began in 1997. According to the Los Angeles Times, the CST "is using state-of-the-art technology to protect Hubbard's writings, tape-recorded lectures and filmed treatises from natural and man-made calamities, including nuclear holocaust."

According to plans filed with the Tuolumne County Building Department the facility features a 15-foot-wide, 250-foot-long-tunnel. The first 98 feet from the entrance are improved, with a 10.5-foot domed ceiling. At the end of the 98 feet is a 10-foot-long storage room. 

=== Trementina, New Mexico (San Miguel Ranch / Trementina Base) ===
According to CST, the purpose of this base is to provide storage space for an archiving project to preserve Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[Scientology bibliography|writings]], [[Scientology filmography|films]] and recordings for future generations. Hubbard's texts have been engraved on stainless steel tablets and encased in titanium capsules underground. The project began in the late 1980s.

The base includes a number of dwellings and the archives themselves, the latter in a network of underground tunnels. The base also has its own private, concrete airstrip, the San Miguel Ranch Airport (NM53).

The site is about a 2 1/2-hour drive east of Santa Fe. Access is through a gated road and a private concrete airstrip, the San Miguel Ranch Airport (NM53). The Trementina location is supposedly a store for material written by L.R. Hubbard, as shown in 1998 on ABC News's "20/20.":

"Buried deep in these New Mexico hills in steel-lined tunnels, said to be able to survive a nuclear blast, is what Scientology considers the future of mankind," ABC's Tom Jarriel said in his report. "Seen here for the first time, thousands of metal records, stored in heat-resistant titanium boxes and playable on a solar-powered turntable, all containing the beliefs of Scientology's founder, L. Ron Hubbard."

The site is marked from the air with Church of Spiritual Technology double diamonds. A runway for smaller airplanes is located on CST owned land in connection to the site. The original short strip was expanded in the early 1990s on land acquired by a land swap deal between CST and neighboring land owners in 1992.

==Archives==
The CST oversees the Scientology scriptural archiving project, which aims to preserve the works of Hubbard on stainless steel tablets and encased in [[titanium]] capsules in specially constructed [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Bob | last = Henderson | title = Vault to get Hubbard's writings | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/50647275.html?dids=50647275:50647275&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT | work =  | publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 1991-07-25 | accessdate = 2007-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of Hubbard's works go through a rigorous process, beginning with the [[Mass deacidification|removal of deterioration-causing acid from the paper]], and then being placed in plastic envelopes. They are then placed in the titanium "time capsules." The writings are also carved into stainless steel plates, which, according to Church of Scientology officials, can withstand being sprayed with salt water for a thousand years. Hubbard’s taped lectures are recorded again into gold compact discs encased in glass.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/local/la-scientologysided062490-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church places prime value to Hubbard’s volumes of works and because of this has instituted the CST to “engrave the entire corpus of Hubbard’s original texts on steel plates.”&lt;ref name="Cowan 2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowan |first1=Douglas |last2=Bromley |first2=David |title=Cults and New Religions: A Brief History |chapter=Wiley Blackwell Brief Histories of Religion |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2015 |accessdate=2015-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous example is the [[Trementina Base]], an underground vault built into a mountainside near [[Trementina, New Mexico]]. It is marked by a CST logo visible only from a high altitude and was built in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/26/AR2005112601065.html | title=A Place in the Desert for New Mexico's Most Exclusive Circles | publisher=Washington Post | date=November 27, 2005 | accessdate=July 11, 2012 | author=Leiby, Richard | pages=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Anderson| last = Cooper| authorlink = Anderson Cooper | title = Inside the Church of Scientology| url = http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0512/02/acd.01.html| format = Transcript | work = [[Anderson Cooper 360°]]| publisher = CNN | date = 2005-12-02 | accessdate = 2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former members claim that the purpose of CST's archival efforts is to ensure that Hubbard's work survive a [[nuclear apocalypse]] and reform civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/07/scientology_shelly_miscavige_disappeared.php Scientology Leader David Miscavige's Disappeared Wife Shelly: What We Know], ''The Village Voice'', 5 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/02/scientologys_se.php Scientology's Secret Vaults: A Rare Interview With a Former Member of Hush-Hush "CST"], ''The Village Voice'', 6 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The church believes that these plates will last beyond a thousand years and that Hubbard’s teachings will be vital for "rebuilding civilization," in the event of global turmoil.&lt;ref name="Cowan 2015"/&gt; Former members of the church also claim that the symbols in the logo are “guide markers for Scientologists returning from other parts of the universe," according to ''Scientology in Popular Culture: Influences and Struggles for Legitimacy.''

According to the Scientology website, the Church of Spiritual Technology “is not involved in the ecclesiastical management of Scientology churches or the delivery of Scientology religious services. Its day-to-day activities are the long-term archival preservation methods to ensure that Mr. Hubbard’s written recorded works will be preserved for future generations.” The website also states that the archive’s purpose is to make available L. Ron Hubbard’s technology “in its exact and original form, no matter what happens to the society.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=J. |title=Handbook of Scientology |volume=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The very first time the Church of Spiritual Technology was mentioned publicly to Scientologists was by COB RTC David Miscavige in 2000 at the New Year's event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freezone.najbjerg.info/dokumenter/the-new-year-2000-event?set_language=en New Year 2000 event speech excerpt, by D.Miscavige]&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders included [[Meade Emory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/seattletimes/obituary.aspx?n=george-meade-emory&amp;pid=145944048 | title=George Meade Emory Obituary | publisher=Seattle Times | date=October 12, 2010 | accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-Scientologist who used to work for the [[Internal Revenue Service]] but went into private practice as a tax lawyer. He was hired as a specialist for the complex Internal Revenue Codes. The Church of Scientology International and most Scientology organizations settled with the IRS about 11 years later when the service passed a resolution in 1993 declaring the Church tax-exempt.

Other Scientology organizations require all corporate officers to be Scientologists in good standing, along with Scientologist general directors and staff. The Church of Spiritual Technology, however, includes "Special Directors" who are not required to be Scientologists, but who are required to be lawyers "to ensure that CST takes no action to jeopardize its tax-exempt status" (CST vs. IRS, US Claims Court No. 581-88T, June 29, 1992).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/blog/suleiman2/cst_vs_irs_1992.html CST vs. IRS - United States Claims Court, June 29 1992&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Communication Arts''''' is the largest international [[trade journal]] of visual communications.&lt;ref name="Audit Bureau of Circulations"&gt;[http://www.accessabc.com/ Audit Bureau of Circulations] Publisher’s Statement 12/07&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1959 by Richard Coyne and Robert Blanchard, the magazine's coverage includes [[graphic design]], [[advertising]], [[photography]], [[illustration]] and [[interactive media]]. The magazine continues to be edited and published under the guidance of Coyne's wife Jean and their son Patrick Coyne. Currently, ''Communication Arts'' (CA) publishes six issues a year and hosts six creative competitions in graphic design, advertising, photography, illustration, typography and interactive media and two Web sites,   commarts.com  and  creativehotlist.com

==History==
The magazine was established in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=14 Essential Magazines for Graphic Designers|url=http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/01/14-essential-magazines-for-graphic-designers/|accessdate=August 22, 2016|work=Web Designer Depot|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue debuted in August 1959 as the ''Journal of Commercial Art''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Commercial Art'', Vol. 1, #1, August, 1959, Palo Alto, California&lt;/ref&gt; Among a number of innovations, it was the first U.S. magazine printed by offset lithography.&lt;ref&gt;“Yesterday in CA”, ''Communication Arts'', Vol. 31, #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Within six months, paid circulation grew to 10,000. Paid advertising, however, was low and CA was not a financial success. After Blanchard left to go into business by himself, Coyne and a small staff continued to write, design, and produce the magazine. Eventually, paid circulation increased to 38,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srds.com/ SRDS] Publisher’s Sworn Statement, June 30, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

CA's current audited paid circulation is 63,043&lt;ref name="Audit Bureau of Circulations" /&gt; and an average of 3.1 people see each issue, giving ''Communication Arts'' an estimated reach of 189,129 readers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commarts.com/download/mediaInfo.pdf Media info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716154801/http://www.commarts.com/download/mediaInfo.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitions== 
To generate additional income and editorial content, the magazine began an annual [[Juried (competition)|juried competition]] in 1960. Within a few years, the annual competition grew, and eventually segmented into four annual competitions: graphic design, advertising, photography and illustration. A fifth competition, interactive, was added  in 1995. All the CA competitions are juried by  creative professionals.

== Online presences ==
CA was the first major design publication to launch a Web presence ([http://www.commarts.com/ Communication Arts]) in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331051305/http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html |date=2008-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to showcasing creative work in visual communications, it included job listings. The jobs section grew, and was relaunched in 2001 as a standalone website,   Creative Hotlist.  These two websites receive approximately three million page views and 250,000 unique visitors per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commarts.com/advertise/web_overview.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217070426/http://www.commarts.com/advertise/web_overview.html |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage}}
[[File:Antiques restoration.jpg|thumb|Antiques restoration]]
A '''conservator-restorer''' is a professional responsible for the [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|preservation of artistic and cultural artifacts]], also known as [[cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation#.WSymX8m1tPs About Conservation: What is conservation? What is a conservator?]". American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservators possess the expertise to preserve cultural heritage in a way that retains the integrity of the object, building or site, including its historical significance, context and aesthetic or visual aspects.&lt;ref name="Defining2003"&gt;Defining the Conservator: Essential Competencies. (2003). Retrieved from http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/defining-the-conservator-essential-competencies.pdf?sfvrsn=1.&lt;/ref&gt;  This kind of preservation is done by analyzing and assessing the condition of cultural property, understanding processes and evidence of deterioration, planning [[collections care]] or site management strategies that prevent damage, carrying out conservation treatments, and conducting research.&lt;ref name="Careers2014"&gt;Careers in Conservation. (2014). Retrieved from http://www.conservation-us.org/publications-resources/careers-in-conservation/become-a-conservator#.VPPIxMaLTwN.&lt;/ref&gt;  A conservator's job is to ensure that the objects in a museum's collection are kept in the best possible condition, as well as to serve the museum's mission to bring art before the [[public]].&lt;ref name="Neuman2011"&gt;Neuman, R. (2011). MFA Highlights: Conservation and Care of Museum Collections. Boston, MA: Museum of Fine Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation and restoration ==
Essentially, the term "conservation" refers to a manner of care or treatment that repairs damage and also takes action to prevent or slow down further deterioration of an object.&lt;ref name="Landry2000"&gt;Landry, G. (2000). The Wintertbur Guide to Caring for Your Collection. Winterthur, Delaware, DE: Winterthur Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "restoration" refers to a manner of care or treatment in which the goal is to bring an object back to its original appearance or function.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt; "Restoration" can be part of the care and treatment of an object and is a subset of the umbrella term "conservation".&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;  Both terms come into play when it comes to the treatment and care of all cultural heritage.

== Responsibilities and duties ==
Conservators and restorers care for, manage, treat, preserve, and document many different historical items including [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]], [[art]], and specimens.&lt;ref name="Baker2015"&gt;Baker, G. D. (2015). How to Become a Museum Conservator. Retrieved from http://collegemouse.com/jobs/how-to-become-a-museum-conservator.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Examining artifacts, both visually and using scientific tools such as x-rays, infrared photography and microscopic analysis to determine the extent and causes of deterioration.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013"&gt;Johnston, L. (2013). Museum/gallery conservator job description. Retrieved from http://www.prospects.ac.uk/museum_gallery_conservator_job_description.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservation science (sometimes called museum science) aids every aspect of a museum’s mission to study its collections, both inside and out of the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Maintaining full conservation records by documenting the condition of an object or site, including any previous restoration work and to outline treatment methods and materials in detail.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Documentation ensures the careful recording of treatment procedures and materials so there can be no misunderstanding in the future about what is part of the original work of art and what has been added or altered by the conservator&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Producing a visual record of the object for identification purposes and to illustrate its condition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  The examination of the object, treatment proposal, and the actual treatment is documented with written reports and photographs&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Monitoring and recording display and storage conditions with the aim of keeping objects in a stable condition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Preservation is the ultimate goal of conservation.  By taking into account the possible day-to-day stresses caused by an object’s environment, museum conservators do their best to preserve art for generations to come.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Proposing and estimating the costs of treatments to halt decay and stabilize an artifact.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Conservators, present a proposal for work to be done as well as a report on the completion of the treatment.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Restoration to bring a deteriorated or damaged object or structure closer to a previous or assumed appearance or function.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Although conservators cannot exactly recapture the original appearance, they are able to make highly educated decisions about how to restore an object if they identify the materials from which it was made and fully understand their properties.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Organizing the logistics of long-term projects and collaborating with other conservators.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  This collaboration can take place when items are on loan or when outside help is needed for complex conservation projects.
* Working out creative solutions to clean, support and repair sensitive objects.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Ultimately, just as every object is unique, every conservation decision must be considered on its own and on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Developing and maintaining appropriate standards within the specialist area.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Critical information can be lost and an object permanently damaged when things are cared for without basic guidelines and information.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Keeping up to date with the latest conservation techniques and practices, through research and training.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Conservation is a young profession, which means it continues to evolve over time and conservators must be able to keep up to date with the latest trends.
* Advising on procedures for the safe exhibition and travel of cultural materials .  Museum conservators strive to maintain the integrity of each work of art throughout its life, whenever it is handled, stored, displayed, or shipped to other locations for exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Direct and supervise curatorial, technical, and student staff in the handling, mounting, care, and storage of art objects.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Other museum departments look to conservators and restorers for direction on safety procedures when it comes to objects in the museum's collection.
* Recommend preservation procedures, such as control of temperature and humidity, to curatorial and building staff.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  The most important step you can take to ensure the preservation of any collection is to create a safe display and storage environment that will not cause further deterioration of the objects.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;

== Education and training ==

=== Undergraduate and graduate education ===
Conservators can receive training through apprenticeships, internships and graduate programs. In order to be accepted into a graduate program, they will need to fulfill some undergraduate prerequisites.  This includes undergraduate coursework in science, the humanities (art history, anthropology, and archaeology), and studio art.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Some graduate programs may also require internship, volunteer, apprenticeship, or paid conservation experience.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Many may also require a personal interview where candidates are asked to present a portfolio of art and conservation project work that demonstrates manual dexterity and familiarity with techniques and materials.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Graduate programs generally require two to four years of study, which can also include a full-time internship in the final year where students work under the guidance of experienced conservators.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  There are also a limited number of Ph.D. programs for advanced study in conservation.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Conservation-related programs are described on the websites of the AIC,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/jobs/become-a-conservator#.WSycysm1tPt Careers in Conservation: Become a Conservator]".

== Ethics ==
The primary goal for conservators and restorers is the preservation of cultural property.  In order to achieve this goal, conservators abide by a code of ethics and guidelines that establish the principles that guide conservation professionals and others who are involved in the care of cultural property.  An example of a code of ethics and guidelines for practice were created by the [[American Institute for Conservation|American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC)]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics#.VPPM0saLTwM Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practive]" (2015). American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important principles in a conservator's code of ethics is that treatments should be reversible, which means that one must be able to undo any treatment in the future.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;  Conservators strive to only minimize interventions and not completely alter an object during restoration.  Conservation focuses on the material aspects of art, and respect for original materials remains a crucial element of the field's ethics.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;

'''''Creed II''''' is a 2018 American [[Sports film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Steven Caple Jr.]], and written by Juel Taylor and [[Sylvester Stallone]], from a story by Sascha Penn and [[Cheo Hodari Coker]]. A sequel to ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' (2015) and the eighth installment in the [[Rocky (film series)|''Rocky'' film series]], it stars [[Michael B. Jordan]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Tessa Thompson]], [[Dolph Lundgren]], Florian Munteanu, [[Wood Harris]], and [[Phylicia Rashad]]. ''Creed'' writer-director [[Ryan Coogler]] serves as an [[executive producer]] on the film. The film follows a fight [[Rocky IV|over 30 years in the making]], as [[Adonis Creed]] meets a new adversary in the ring: Viktor Drago, son of [[Ivan Drago]], the powerful athlete who killed Adonis' father [[Apollo Creed]].

A ''Creed'' sequel was confirmed in January 2016, although due to both Coogler and Jordan's involvement in ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', the film was delayed, with Coogler ultimately being replaced by Caple. Stallone completed the script in July 2017 and announced Lundgren would be reprising his role as Drago, and filming began in [[Philadelphia]] in March 2018, lasting through July.

''Creed II'' was released in the United States by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures]] on November 21, 2018. The film has grossed over $92 million and received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the cast and character development, calling it a "solid, if predictable" sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=Christopher|title=Creed II First Reviews: A Solid, if Predictable, Sequel

== Plot ==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
Three years after his loss to "Pretty" Ricky Conlan, [[Adonis Creed]] scores a string of victories, culminating in a victory over Danny "Stuntman" Wheeler ([[Andre Ward]]) to win the WBC World Heavyweight Championship. Now a worldwide star, Adonis proposes to his girlfriend, Bianca Taylor, who agrees to marry him. When Bianca suggests starting a new life together in Los Angeles, Adonis is reluctant to leave his life behind in Philadelphia. 

Meanwhile, [[Ivan Drago]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] boxer who killed Adonis's father, [[Apollo Creed]], in the ring [[Rocky IV|thirty-three years earlier]], sees an opportunity to regain the glory that was taken from him as a result of his loss to Rocky Balboa in Moscow later that same year by pitting his son, Viktor Drago (with the assistance of Buddy Marcelle, a promoter who has followed Viktor's career closely), against Adonis. When Rocky refuses to support Adonis's decision to accept Viktor's challenge, Adonis, feeling betrayed, decides to leave for Los Angeles.

Adonis and Bianca settle down in a luxurious apartment in Los Angeles close to Adonis's adoptive mother, and Apollo’s widow, Mary Anne. As Adonis and Bianca adjust to their new life on the west coast and prepare for the upcoming match with Viktor, Bianca learns that she is pregnant. Adonis recruits Tony "Little Duke" Evers, son of [[Tony "Duke" Evers|his father's trainer]], as Rocky's replacement. Overwhelmed with all the recent developments in his life, Adonis rushes into the match, getting himself badly injured. Viktor is disqualified for hitting Adonis while he is down, allowing Adonis to retain the World Heavyweight Championship.

His body and ego shattered, Adonis becomes increasingly disconnected from Bianca. Mary Anne reaches out to Rocky in hopes of having him come to help Adonis out of his slump; Rocky arrives, he and Adonis make up, and Rocky agrees to train Adonis properly for a rematch against Viktor. Viktor, with his newfound popularity, is suffering near-torture levels of physical tests by his father. At a State Dinner, he and Ivan meet Ludmilla, his mother, and ex-wife, for the first time several years after she abandoned both of them after the loss to Balboa. Bianca gives birth to a baby girl, and they name her Amara. Adonis and Bianca's fears are realized when their child is born deaf, inherited from her mother's progressive degenerative hearing disorder. 

While Viktor continues to taunt Adonis publicly, he is constantly pressured by his father to regain their honor. Rocky takes Adonis to a decrepit location in the California desert to retrain, describing it as a place where fighters are "reborn". Adonis undergoes a rigorous and brutal training regimen with Rocky, focusing on fighting from the inside and training his body to repeatedly absorb the heavy impact he knows he'll receive from Viktor in the ring.

The rematch in Moscow is considerably more balanced as a more controlled and focused Adonis exchanges equal blows with Viktor. Since Viktor is accustomed to winning all of his fights by knockout, his fights have never lasted beyond the fourth round, something that Adonis uses to his advantage as he endures Viktor's punishment deeper into the match, even after his ribs break again. In the tenth round after being knocked down again, Adonis unleashes a furious rage, managing to land sequence after sequence of effective blows, knocking Viktor down twice. Viktor's mother Ludmilla, who had been sitting ringside with some of Viktor's supporters, departs when the tide of the fight shifts in Adonis' favor, knocking Viktor off-balance emotionally. Ivan notes this as well, coming to terms with earlier statements made by Viktor regarding the fair-weathered nature of the same supporters who had run Ivan out of Russia. With Viktor cornered and receiving multiple strikes without returning any blows, Rocky watches in amazement as Ivan makes his way to where his son his cornered. Ivan throws in the towel, conceding the fight to Adonis to ensure his son isn’t seriously injured or killed. Though Viktor is ashamed, Ivan assures Viktor it is okay that he lost, and embraces him. As Bianca enters the ring to celebrate with Adonis, Rocky recuses himself from joining them. Telling Adonis that it is “his time”, he takes a seat and watches them from outside the ring.  

Viktor and Ivan are later training together back in Ukraine. Rocky travels to Vancouver to make peace with his own estranged son, Robert, and meets his grandson Logan for the first time, noting how much he looks like Adrian. Adonis visits Apollo’s grave where he makes peace with his deceased father and the burden of carrying on his legacy, as he and Bianca introduce him to his granddaughter, who is sporting new hearing aids.

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 195 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Creed II''{{'}}s adherence to franchise formula adds up to a sequel with few true surprises, but its time-tested generational themes still pack a solid punch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/creed_ii|title=Creed II (2018)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|access-date=November 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on reviews from 42 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/creed-ii|title=Creed II reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, the same score earned by its predecessor, while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it an 87% positive score and a 72% "definite recommend".&lt;ref name="opening"/&gt;

Odie Henderson of ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, stating that "''Creed II'' falls victim to the sins of sequelitis—it's bigger, louder and more grandiose than its predecessor—yet manages to right itself by not losing focus on the humanity of its central characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/creed-ii-2018|title=Creed II Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2018) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Henderson|first=Odie|website=www.rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film "rousing and effective" and wrote "''Creed II'' has been made with heart and skill, and Jordan invests each moment with such fierce conviction that he makes it all seem like it matters.

The '''Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts''' ({{lang-la|Academia Scientiarum et Artium Croatica}}, {{lang-hr|Hrvatska akademija znanosti i umjetnosti}}, abbrev. HAZU) is the [[national academy]] of [[Croatia]]. Founded in 1866, it is the oldest national academy in [[Southeast Europe]]. 

HAZU was founded under patronage of the Croatian bishop [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]] under the name ''Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts'' ({{lang|hr|Jugoslavenska akademija znanosti i umjetnosti}}, abbrev. JAZU) since its founder wanted to make it the central scientific and artistic institution of all South Slavs. Today, its main goals are encouraging and organizing scientific work, applying the achieved results, development of artistic and cultural activities, carrying about the Croatian cultural heritage and its affirmation in the world, publishing the results of scientific research and artistic creativity and giving suggestions and opinions for the advancement of science and art in areas of particular importance to Croatia.

The academy is divided into nine classes; social sciences, mathematical, physical and chemical sciences, natural sciences, medical sciences, philological sciences, Literature, Fine Arts, Musical Arts and Musicology, technical sciences. The Academy started in 1866 with 16 full members which grew to today's 160. Besides full, members can also be honorary, corresponding or associate.

== History ==
The institution was founded in [[Zagreb]] on 29 April 1861 by the decision of the Croatian Parliament (Sabor) as the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts.&lt;ref&gt;The adjective "Yugoslav" was coined in mid-19th century by the movement that sought national unity of the [[South Slavs]] from [[Austria-Hungary]] with their eastern neighbors. Its extent was likely ambiguous, e.g. in whether or not it meant to include [[Bulgarians]] and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]]. Later the term became associated specifically with the country and peoples of [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop and benefactor [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]], a prominent advocate of higher [[education]] during the 19th century Croatian [[romantic nationalism|national romanticism]], set up a trust fund for this purpose and in 1860 submitted a large donation to the then viceroy ([[ban (title)|ban]]) of Croatia [[Josip Šokčević]] for the cause of being able to
{{Cquote|bring together the best minds {{interp|...}} and find a way in which books in the national languages could be produced in the Slavic South; the Academy should also take under its aegis all the areas of human science&lt;ref name="Founding"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://info.hazu.hr/foundation_of_academy | title=The Founding of the Academy | publisher=Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts | accessdate=2009-01-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606084626/http://info.hazu.hr/foundation_of_academy | archivedate=6 June 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Agram, Academy Palace, with St. George Monument, by Fernkorn, Croatia, Austro-Hungary-LCCN2002710733.jpg|thumb|left|Academy Palace in the 1890s]]
After some years of deliberations by the [[Croatian Parliament]] and the Emperor [[Franz Joseph]], it was finally sanctioned by [[law]] in 1866. The official sponsor was Josip Juraj Strossmayer, while the first [[Chairman]] of the Academy was the distinguished Croatian [[historian]] [[Franjo Rački]].&lt;ref name="Founding"/&gt; [[Đuro Daničić]] was elected for secretary general of the Academy, where he played a key role in preparing the Academy's Dictionary, "Croatian or Serbian Dictionary of JAZU".

The Academy's creation was the logical extension of the [[University of Zagreb]], the institution initially created in 1669 and also renewed by bishop Strossmayer in 1874. Bishop Strossmayer also initiated the building of the Academy Palace in the [[Zrinjevac (Zagreb)|Zrinjevac]] park of Zagreb, and the Palace was completed in 1880.&lt;ref name="Founding"/&gt; In 1884, the Palace also became a host of [[The Strossmayer Gallery of Old Masters]] that contained 256 works of art (mostly paintings).&lt;ref name="Founding"/&gt; The same is today one of the most prominent [[art gallery|art galleries]] in Zagreb.

The Academy started publishing the academic journal ''[[Rad (journal)|Rad]]'' in 1867. In 1882, each of the individual scientific classes of the Academy started printing their own journals. In 1887, the Academy published the first "Ljetopis" as a year book, as well as several other publications in [[history]] and [[ethnology]].

[[Ivan Supek]], [[Mihailo Petrović]], [[Dragutin Gorjanović-Kramberger]] and [[Lavoslav Ružička]] were JAZU members.

=== Name changes ===

The Academy briefly changed name from "Yugoslav" to "Croatian" between 1941 and 1945 during the [[Axis powers|Axis]] client regime of the [[Independent State of Croatia]].

It has again been renamed "Croatian" in 1991 after Croatia gained independence from Yugoslavia.

The Academy has recently been criticized to the effect that membership and activities are based on academic [[cronyism]] and political favor rather than on scientific and artistic merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jindra |first=Jelena |date=20 July 2010 |title=HAZU: najskuplji starački dom |trans-title=Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts: the most expensive retirement home |url=http://82.94.203.142/hrvatska/hazu-najskuplji-staracki-dom?onepage=1 |language=Croatian |publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)|''Nacional'']] |location=Zagreb |archivedate=12 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CrCCusX1?url=http://82.94.203.142/hrvatska/hazu-najskuplji-staracki-dom?onepage=1 |accessdate=12 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mija |last=Pavliša |date=9 February 2011 |title=Nevjerodostojnom biografijom do članstva u HAZU: nepostojeće knjige Dunje Brozović |url=http://www.tportal.hr/kultura/knjizevnost/110709/Nevjerodostojnom-biografijom-do-clanstva-u-HAZU.html |language=Croatian |location=Zagreb |publisher=''T-portal'' |issn=1334-3130 |archivedate=7 September 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AUm6pTZ1?url=http://www.tportal.hr/kultura/knjizevnost/110709/Nevjerodostojnom-biografijom-do-clanstva-u-HAZU.html |accessdate=27 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tamara |last=Opačić |date=9 February 2011 |title=Čija je Dunja Brozović Rončević? |url=http://www.h-alter.org/vijesti/kultura/cija-je-sve-dunja-brozovic-roncevicc |language=Croatian |location=Zagreb |publisher=''H-alter'' |issn=1847-3784 |archivedate=12 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CrCLIwpf?url=http://www.h-alter.org/vijesti/kultura/cija-je-sve-dunja-brozovic-roncevicc |accessdate=12 December 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Branko |last=Detelj |date=14 February 2011 |title=Hrvatska akademija zadrtosti i učmalosti |trans-title=Croatian Academy of Bigotry and Stuffiness |url=http://www.evarazdin.hr/kolumna/hazu-hrvatska-akademija-zadrtosti-i-ucmalosti/ |language=Croatian |location=Varaždin |publisher=''E-Varaždin.hr'' |archivedate=12 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CrCRGYzG?url=http://www.evarazdin.hr/kolumna/hazu-hrvatska-akademija-zadrtosti-i-ucmalosti/ |accessdate=12 December 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Popović |first=Sofija |date=6 December 2011 |title=HAZU treba ukinuti a jezične puritance bojkotirati jer zarađuju na nacionalizmu: razgovor sa Snježanom Kordić |trans-title=Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts should be abolished and puritan linguists boycotted because they profit from nationalism: Interview with Snježana Kordić |url=http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/121072/hazu-treba-ukinuti-a-jezicne-puritance-bojkotirati-jer-zaraduju-na-nacionalizmu |language=Croatian |publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)|''Nacional'']] |location=Zagreb |pages=64–68 |archivedate=7 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68yzBqzSX?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/565689.Intervju_Nacional.PDF |accessdate=23 August 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 matters came to a head with the Academy's refusal to induct Dr. [[Miroslav Radman]], an accomplished [[biologist]], a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], and an advocate of a higher degree of [[meritocracy]] and accountability in Croatian [[academia]]. His supporters within the Academy and the media decried the decision as reinforcing a politically motivated, unproductive ''status quo''.

Dr. [[Ivo Banac]], a [[Yale University]] professor and then a deputy in the [[Croatian parliament]], addressed the chamber in a speech decrying a "dictatorship of mediocrity" in the Academy, while ''[[Globus (weekly)|Globus]]'' columnist [[Boris Dežulović]] satirized the institution as an "Academy of stupidity and obedience." Dr. [[Vladimir Paar]] and others defended the Academy's decision, averring that it did take pains to include accomplished scientists but that, since Dr. Radman's work has mostly taken place outside Croatia, it was appropriate that he remain a Corresponding rather than a Full Member of the Academy.&lt;ref name="feral"&gt;"Dictatorship of Mediocrity" debate, ''Feral Tribune'', 2006.

'''''Dead Christ Supported by Two Angels''''' is a painting by  Italian Renaissance painter [[Giovanni Bellini]], created around 1460. It is housed in the [[Museo Correr]] in [[Venice]].

The panel is one of Bellini's earliest ''[[Pietà]]'' compositions, together with those in the [[Accademia Carrara]] of Bergamo and in the [[Museo Poldi Pezzoli]] of [[Milan]]. The date in the sepulchre's edge (1499) is [[apocriphal]], such as [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s [[monogram]].

'''Dieudonné M'bala M'bala''' (born 11 February 1966), generally known by his stage name '''Dieudonné''' ({{IPA-fr|djø.dɔ.ne|lang}}), is a French comedian, actor and political activist. His father is from [[Cameroon]], his mother from France.  He has been accused of and convicted for hate speech,&lt;ref name="video.lefigaro.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.lefigaro.fr/figaro/video/dieudonne-fait-appel-de-sa-condamnation-en-belgique-pour-antisemitisme/4632804704001/|title=Dieudonné fait appel de sa condamnation en Belgique pour antisémitisme|author=|date=|work=Figaro Tv}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocating terrorism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2015/03/18/97001-20150318FILWWW00243-je-suis-charlie-coulibaly-dieudonne-condamne.php|title=Je suis 'Charlie Coulibaly', Dieudonné condamné|author=|date=|work=Le Figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt; and slander&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egaliteetreconciliation.fr/Mussolini-moitie-trisomique-Dieudonne-condamne-en-appel-pour-sa-description-de-Manuel-Valls-36603.html|title="Mussolini moitié trisomique" : Dieudonné condamné en appel pour sa description de Manuel Valls|author=|date=|work=Egalité &amp; Réconciliation.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Belgium and in France.

Dieudonné initially achieved success working with comedian [[Élie Semoun]], humorously exploiting racial stereotypes. He campaigned against [[racism]] and was a candidate in the 1997 and 2001 legislative elections in [[Dreux]] against the [[National Front (France)|National Front]], the French far-right political party that he perceived as racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/who-is-dieudonn-how-the-french-comedian-was-thrust-into-the-spotlight-by-nicolas-anelkas-quenelle-goal-celebration-9030721.html|title=Who is Dieudonné?

==Personal life==
Dieudonné M'bala M'bala was born in [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]], [[Hauts-de-Seine]], France.

==Performing career==
After getting his baccalaureate in computer science, Dieudonné began writing and practicing routines with his childhood friend, Jewish comedian and actor [[Élie Semoun]]. They formed a comedic duo, [[Élie and Dieudonné|Élie et Dieudonné]] (Élie and Dieudonné), and performed in local cafés and bars while Dieudonné worked as a salesman, selling cars, telephones, and photocopy machines. In 1992, a Paris comedian spotted them and helped them stage their first professional show.&lt;ref name="NewYorker" /&gt; In the 1990s, they appeared on stage and on television together as "Élie et Dieudonné". In 1997 they split and each went on to a solo theater career. In 1998, they reunited in a screen comedy, ''Le Clone'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180607/ |title=Le clone (1998) |publisher=IMDb.com |date= |accessdate=10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a failure critically and financially. From the mid-1990s Dieudonné appeared in several French film comedies, primarily in supporting roles. His most successful screen appearance to date was in [[Alain Chabat]]'s box-office hit ''[[Asterix &amp; Obelix: Mission Cleopatra]]'' in 2002; in 2004 he appeared in [[Maurice Barthélémy]]'s [[box office bomb]] ''Casablanca Driver''.
 
Dieudonné's successful one-man shows include ''Pardon Judas'' (2000), ''Le divorce de Patrick'' (2003), and ''1905'' (2005). Other one-man shows were ''Mes Excuses'' (2004), ''Dépôt de bilan'' (2006) and ''J'ai fait l'con'' (2008), all understood as attacks on political and social opponents and defences of his own positions. Anti-Semitic statements made within and around these productions led to intense controversy and numerous lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051013003803/http://www.communautarisme.net/Dieudonne-rappel-des-principaux-faits-entourant-la-polemique_a348.html ''Dieudonné : rappel des principaux faits entourant la polémique''], Observatoire du communautarisme, 26 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[2005 civil unrest in France]], Dieudonné also penned a play called ''Émeutes en banlieue'' (Riots in the Suburbs, February 2006). In 2009, surrounded by scandals (see below, "Political activities"), Dieudonné launched two one-man shows: ''Liberté d’expression'' (''Freedom of expression'')  and ''Sandrine''. While the latter was a follow-up to ''Le divorce de Patrick'', the former was conceived as a series of itinerant "conferences" on "[[free speech]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120718065517/http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/societe/20090318.OBS9384/dieudonne_donne_une_conference_dans_un_car.

Dieudonné's production company first acted under the name Bonnie Productions and now under the name Les productions de la Plume.

In 2012, Dieudonné made his directorial debut in a film called ''L’Antisémite'' (''The Anti-Semite''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/104436/antisemite-banned-at-cannes?all=1| title=L’Antisémite, Banned at Cannes.

==Théâtre de la Main d'Or==
Dieudonné is the lessee of the ''Théâtre de la Main d'Or'' in the [[11th arrondissement of Paris]], which is used for both stand-up comedy and political events by himself and friends.

==Political activities and views==

===Beginnings===
Dieudonné was initially active on the anti-racist left. In the [[French legislative election, 1997|1997 French legislative election]], he worked with his party, "Les Utopistes", in [[Dreux]] against National Front candidate [[Marie-France Stirbois]] and received 8 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vigile.net/Dieudonne-Bouffon-de-cour ''Dieudonné – Bouffon de cour''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517074058/http://www.vigile.net/Dieudonne-Bouffon-de-cour |date=17 May 2009 }}, voir.ca (reissued on Vigile.net), 14 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Verbally and in demonstrations, he also supported migrants without a residence permit (the so-called "sans papiers") and the [[Palestinians]].

===2002–2006===
[[File:Dieudonné M’bala M’bala.jpg|thumb|Dieudonné in 2006]]
Since 2002, Dieudonné has attracted attention by making increasingly polemical statements. In an interview for the magazine ''[[Lyon]] Capitale'' in January 2002, he described "the [[Jew]]s" as "a sect, a fraud, which is the worst of all, because it was the first" and said he preferred "the charisma of [[Osama bin Laden|bin Laden]] to that of [[George W. Bush|Bush]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/dieudonne-juge-raciste-en-cassation_462984.html ''Dieudonné jugé raciste en cassation''], ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'', 25 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently tried to run for president in the [[French presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential election]], but failed to get in the race.

On 1 December 2003, he appeared live on a television show disguised as a parody of an Israeli settler wearing military fatigues and a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] (Orthodox) Jewish hat. The sketch climaxed with a [[Hitler salute]], after which Dieudonné shouts out a word. According to Dieudonné, he shouted "Israël" in the persona of the Haredi. In the following days, some news agencies stated that he shouted "Isra – Heil" or "Heil Israel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/portrait/0101478926-la-ou-la-blague-blesse ''Là où la blague blesse''], [[libération]], 20 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.24heures.ch/actu/culture/dieudonne-promo-pire-2009-01-06 ''Dieudonné, la promo par le pire''], ''[[24 heures (Switzerland)|24 heures]]'', 7 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was cleared of charges of antisemitism in a Paris court after the judge said this was not an attack against Jews in general but against a type of person "distinguished by their political views".&lt;ref name = "bbc"&gt;{{cite news | title = French comic 'not anti-Semitic' | publisher = BBC | date = 2004-05-27 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3755013.stm | accessdate =7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (France)|2004 European Parliament election]], Dieudonné was candidate for the extreme left-wing party "Euro-Palestine", but left a few months after the election because of disagreements with its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europalestine.com/article.php3?id_article=1410 ''Dieudonné sur une pente très glissante''], Euro-Palestine, 29 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Dieudonné is the director of the Les Ogres website, where he makes plain his denial of the official version of the [[9/11]] events.

On 16 February 2005, he declared during a press conference in [[Algiers]] that the Central Council of French Jews CRIF (''Conseil représentatif des institutions juives de France'') was a "mafia" that had "total control over French policy exercise", called the commemoration of [[the Holocaust]] "memorial pornography"&lt;ref name="NYT2012/06/24"/&gt; ("''pornographie mémorielle''"), and claimed that the "Zionists of the [[Centre National de la Cinématographie]]," which "control French cinema" prevented him from making a film about the [[slave trade]].&lt;ref name="lefigaro.fr"&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2008/06/26/01016-20080626ARTFIG00373-dieudonne-star-de-la-semaine-judiciaire.php ''Dieudonné, star de la semaine judiciaire''], [[Le Figaro]], 26 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidh.org/antisem/dieud01.htm ''A Alger, l'humoriste qualifie la commémoration de la Shoah de "pornographie mémorielle"''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406011910/http://aidh.org/antisem/dieud01.htm |date=6 April 2005 }}, aidh.org, February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Dieudonné was also trying to appear as a spokesman for French blacks, but, after some initial sympathy, notably from the novelist [[Calixthe Beyala]], the journalists [[Antoine Garnier]] and [[Claudy Siar]], as well as the founding members of the ''Conseil représentatif des associations noires'' (CRAN), he increasingly met with their rejection.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Smith, Géraldine Faes: ''Noir et Français!'', Éditions du Panama, April 2006, {{ISBN|2-7557-0106-4}}; [http://www.trend.infopartisan.net/trd0906/t400906.html Bernhard Schmid: Reise nach Beirut.] Trend-online, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In France and abroad, Dieudonné became increasingly perceived as an extremist of a type until then uncommon in Europe: in the introduction to a March 2006 interview, ''[[The Sunday Independent (South Africa)|The Sunday Independent]]'' of [[South Africa]] called him a "French [[Louis Farrakhan]]... obsessed with Jews".&lt;ref name = "ind"&gt;John Lichfield: [http://www.sundayindependent.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=1042&amp;fArticleId=3177751 "French comic's growing anti-Semitism is no joke"], The Sunday Independent, 26 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007–2009===
Dieudonné wanted to finally represent politically these ever-radicalized positions in the [[French presidential elections, 2007|2007 presidential election]], but for logistical reasons he could not maintain his candidacy, which was organized by Marc Robert (a.k.a. Marc George).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120720023059/http://www.bakchich.info/Un-coup-de-tonnerre-Dieudonne-se,00323.html ''Un coup de tonnerre : Dieudonné se retire de la campagne présidentielle''], Bakchich.info, 11 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The convicted [[holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] [[Serge Thion]] wrote for his campaign web site under the pseudonym "Serge Noith", as did also the longtime secretary of the Holocaust denier [[Roger Garaudy]], [[Maria Poumier]].

In July 2008, Jean-Marie Le Pen became godfather to Dieudonné's third child. [[Philippe Laguérie]], a [[traditionalist Catholic]] priest, officiated at the baptism, which was held in the Saint-Éloi congregation in [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://obsession.nouvelobs.com/people/20080716.OBS3105/le-pen-confirme-etre-parrain-d-un-enfant-de-dieudonne.html Le Pen confirme être parrain d'un enfant de Dieudonné] ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]''. 16 July 2008.

On 9 May 2012, Police in Brussels, Belgium, stopped Dieudonné mid-performance after determining that his performance contravened local laws, and forced the cancellation of two more shows, but in November 2013, a Brussels justice found that the comedian was not using anti-Semitic slurs or [[incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|inciting racial hatred]] during the show that was interrupted in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhnet.be/people-buzz/show-biz/les-charges-pour-antisemitisme-abandonnees-contre-dieudonne-527a834e35703e420f409a15|title=Les charges pour antisémitisme abandonnées contre Dieudonné|author=M.

Dieudonné released a song and dance called "Shoananas", performed to the tune of the 1985 children's video and song by [[Annie Cordy]] "[[Cho Ka Ka O]]" (Chaud Cacao or Hot Chocolate in English),&lt;ref name=slate_6_27_2013&gt;La dieudonnisation des esprits, une (grosse) quenelle qui vient d’en bas [http://www.slate.fr/story/74429/dieudonne-quenelle]&lt;/ref&gt; which itself by today's standards might be considered racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47547:french-public-radio-takes-legal-action-against-latest-anti-semitic-remarks-by-comedian-dieudonne&amp;catid=2:france&amp;Itemid=3|title=French public radio takes legal action against latest anti-Semitic remarks by comedian Dieudonné|author=Yossi  Lempkowicz|date=|work=ejpress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Shoananas" is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Shoah]], the French and Hebrew word used to refer to the Holocaust, and [[ananas]], the French word for [[pineapple]].&lt;ref name=quasi_nazi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2013/12/23/news-opinion/world/in-france-quasi-nazi-salute-aims-to-evade-long-arm-of-the-law|title=In France, quasi-Nazi salute may evade long arm of the law|author=|date=|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dieudonné started a trend among his supporters of getting photographed making a unique gesture he invented and dubbed the "[[quenelle (gesture)|quenelle]]". For some it is just a vulgar gesture of opposition to French institutions, for others it is an antisemitic gesture and was dubbed a "reverse Nazi salute" because while a Nazi salute involves an upraised straight arm, the quenelle involves a straight arm pointed at the ground.

In December, while performing onstage, Dieudonné was recorded saying about prominent French Jewish radio journalist Patrick Cohen: "Me, you see, when I hear Patrick Cohen speak, I think to myself: ‘Gas chambers... too bad."’"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20131227-dieudonne-france-famous-french-comic-show-could-be-banned-anti-semitic-content/|title=France may ban French comic’s show for ‘anti-Semitism’|author=|date=|work=France 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio France, Cohen’s employer, announced on 20 December that it had alerted authorities that Dieudonné had engaged in "openly anti-Semitic speech", and various French anti-racism watchdog groups filed complaints.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

French Interior Minister Manuel Valls announced he would try to legally ban public performances by Dieudonné. Valls stated that Dieudonne was "no longer a comedian" but was rather an "anti-Semite and racist" who has run afoul of France's laws against incitement to racial hatred.

"Despite a conviction for public defamation, hate speech and racial discrimination, Dieudonné M’Bala M’Bala no longer seems to recognize any limits," Valls wrote.

"Consequently, the interior minister has decided to thoroughly examine all legal options that would allow a ban on Dieudonné’s public gatherings, which no longer belong to the artistic domain, but rather amount to a public safety risk."&lt;ref name="france24.com"/&gt;

On 31 December, Dieudonné released a 15-minute video proposing that "2014 will be the year of the quenelle!".&lt;ref name="quenelle-video"&gt;{{YouTube|id=0r4YQ54PazA|title=2014 sera l'année de la quenelle !!! }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Dieudonné attacks "bankers" and "slavers", so as not to say "Jews"&lt;ref name="quenelle-video-review"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.numerama.com/magazine/27966-la-34quenelle34-sur-internet-argument-de-valls-pour-interdire-dieudonne.html| title = La "quenelle" sur Internet, argument de Valls pour interdire Dieudonné| accessdate = 7 January 2014| publisher = Numerama| year = 2014| author = Guillaume Champeau| quote = "Attaquant ici "les banquiers", là "les esclavagistes", pour ne pas dire ouvertement "les Juifs" et éviter un procès, Dieudonné entraîne ceux qui l'écoutent et le suivent vers une haine pour les Juifs, dans une vidéo dans laquelle il demande sans transition que 2014 devienne 'l'année de la quenelle'."| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140108055228/http://www.numerama.com/magazine/27966-la-34quenelle34-sur-internet-argument-de-valls-pour-interdire-dieudonne.html| archivedate = 8 January 2014| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and end up in a lawsuit, and calls upon his followers, "quenelleurs"—those who listen and follow him—towards a hatred of Jews.&lt;ref name="quenelle-video-review" /&gt;

"Antisemite? I'm not of that opinion," he says in the video. "I'm not saying I'd never be one... I leave myself open to that possibility, but for the moment, no."

On 6 January, France's interior minister [[Manuel Valls]] said that performances considered anti-Semitic may be banned by local officials.  In support of this, Valls sent a 3-page memo to all prefects of Police in France on 6 January entitled, "The Struggle Against Racism and Antisemitism—demonstrations and public reaction—performances by Mr. Dieudonné M’Bala M’Bala ".  With respect to freedom of speech in France and banning scheduled performances ahead of time, Valls wrote:
"The struggle against racism and antisemitism is an essential concern of government and demands vigorous action."  He takes note of the liberty of expression in France, but goes on to say that in exceptional circumstances, the police are invested with the power to prohibit an event if its intent is to prevent "a grave disturbance of public order" and cites the 1933 law supporting this.&lt;ref name="Valls-circular"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/la-circulaire-anti-dieudonne-de-valls-aux-prefets-06-01-2014-3467133.php| title = Voici la circulaire anti-Dieudonné envoyée par Valls aux préfets| accessdate = 7 January 2014| publisher = [[Le Parisien]]| year = 2014| author = Eric Hacquemand| quote = "He poses personally on the tour poster performing the gesture known as 'the quenelle', a gesture for which his production company has registered intellectual property rights at the [[National Industrial Property Institute (France)|National Industrial Property Institute]] (INPI) and that references his Internet publications, without ever having renounced the racist and antisemitic declarations in his publications. And in the exchanges that he has with a portion of the public, his followers, or numerous people known for their antisemitic and extreme ideas, he has declared in a message published on 1 January [2014] on the Internet site Youtube, that he declares 2014 to be "the year of the quenellé.

Some officials from both sides of the political spectrum have reservations about the legal validity of the Valls circular, and believe that cancellations could leave their cities liable for judgments of millions of euros in damages to Dieudonné if he sues and wins, as actually occurred in La Rochelle in 2012.&lt;ref name="valls-validity-questioned"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/affaire-dieudonne-nombreux-doutes-sur-la-validite-de-la-circulaire-valls-08-01-2014-3473711.php| title = Dieudonné : des doutes sur la validité de la circulaire Valls| accessdate = 9 January 2014| publisher = [[Le Parisien]]| year = 2014| author = leparisien.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a poll by [[IFOP]] for [[Metronews]] taken on 8–9 January 2014, 71% of the French population had a negative image of Dieudonné while 16% held a positive view. The voters of the National Front were the least negative, with 54% seeing him negatively and 32% positively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ouest-france.fr/dieudonne-71-des-francais-ont-une-mauvaise-opinion-du-polemiste-1841086 Dieudonné. 71% des Français ont une mauvaise opinion du polémiste] ''[[Ouest-France]]''.

On 11 January 2014, he announced he would not perform his show ''Le Mur'' but will replace it with another one, ''Asus Zoa'', that he wrote in three nights and that would talk about "dance and music inspired by ancestral myths".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/dieudonne-abandonne-definitivement-son-spectacle-le-mur_1313206.html Dieudonné abandonne définitivement son spectacle "Le Mur"], L'Express, 11 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, Dieudonné was banned from entry in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10615893/French-comedian-Dieudonne-responds-to-British-ban-with-quenelle-to-Queen.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=French comedian Dieudonne responds to British ban with 'quenelle' to Queen | date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, French authorities opened an investigation into Dieudonné on grounds that he condoned terrorism after mocking and showing footage of the killing of U.S. journalist [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]]. He described it as "access to civilisation", comparing it to many colonial crimes in Africa, which included killing and dismembering of victims and which were for decades justified by "civilizing Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French comedian investigated for comments on James Foley killing|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/09/05/uk-france-comedian-idUKKBN0H012K20140905|agency=Reuters|date=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015===
On 10 January 2015, following the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]], the [[Porte de Vincennes siege]] of a kosher supermarket, and the 1,500,000-strong "[[Republican marches|march against hatred]]" in Paris, Dieudonné wrote on Facebook "As far as I am concerned, I feel I am Charlie Coulibaly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=As far as I am concerned, I feel I am Charlie Coulibaly|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/quenelle-comedian-dieudonne-praises-terrorist-killer-as-far-as-i-am-concerned-i-feel-i-am-charlie-coulibaly-9972035.html|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way he mixed the popular slogan "[[Je suis Charlie]]", used to support the journalists killed at the ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' magazine, with a reference to [[Amedy Coulibaly]] who was responsible for the hostage-taking at the kosher supermarket which included the killing of four Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/comedian-arrested-for-comment-on-charlie-hebdo-attacks--.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=76921&amp;NewsCatID=351|title=Comedian arrested for comment on Charlie Hebdo attacks - EUROPE|author=|date=|work=hurriyetdailynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likening his treatment to that of "Public Enemy No. 1," on January 11 Dieudonné complained about it in an open letter to the Minister of the Interior, [[Bernard Cazeneuve]].&lt;ref name="trib-jan11"&gt;{{cite web |language=French |title=Visé par une enquête pour apologie du terrorisme, Dieudonné répond au parquet |trans-title=Targeted by an Investigation for Justification of Terrorism, Dieudonné Responds to the Prosecutor's Office |author=&lt;!--staff writers, byline credits latribune.fr--&gt; |date=12 January 2015 |website=latribune.fr |publisher= |issn=1760-4869 |url=http://www.latribune.fr/actualites/economie/france/20150112tribbf4e03a24/vise-par-enquete-pour-apologie-du-terrorisme-dieudonne-repond-au-parquet.html |accessdate=2017-05-13 |quote=Depuis un an, je suis traité comme l'ennemi public numéro 1, alors que je ne cherche qu'à faire rire, et à faire rire de la mort, puisque la mort, elle, se rit bien de nous, comme Charlie le sait hélas.

On 13 January, Dieudonné was arrested in Paris, accused of publicly supporting terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Holly Yan|author2=Salma Abdelaziz|title=Al Qaeda branch claims responsibility for Charlie Hebdo attack|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/14/europe/charlie-hebdo-france-attacks/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=14 January 2015|date=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on his earlier Facebook comments where he appeared to support the kosher supermarket gunman Amedy Coulibaly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30811401|title=Paris attacks: Dieudonne held as France tackles hate speech|author=|date=14 January 2015|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dieudonné's arrest over his "Je suis Charlie Coulibaly" comments sparked discussion over a perceived hypocrisy concerning freedom of speech, contrasting his bans and arrest, with the freedom for ''Charlie Hebdo'' to publish controversial cartoons of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's at Stake in Europe's Response to Charlie Hebdo|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2015-01-08/whats-at-stake-in-europes-response-to-charlie-hebdo|website=bloomberg.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defiant Parisians snap up copies of latest Charlie Hebdo issue|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/parisians-line-for-blocks-for-new-charlie-hebdo-authorities-detain-comedian/2015/01/14/5a25ad74-9bc8-11e4-bcfb-059ec7a93ddc_story.html|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The quenelle gesture==
{{Main|Quenelle (gesture)}}
[[Quenelle (gesture)|The quenelle]], invented by Dieudonné, is a gesture consisting of a downward straight arm touched at the shoulder by the opposite hand. In French, ''quenelle'' normally refers to a type of [[quenelle|dumpling]]. Images of the quenelle became viral in 2013, with many individuals posing while performing the quenelle in photos posted to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/reuters-france-may-ban-comedian-for-hate-speech/1818573.html|title=France May Ban Black Comedian for Hate Speech|author=|date=|work=VOA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dieudonné claims that the gesture is an anti-establishment protest. The gesture has also been described as a reverse Nazi salute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2530377/West-Brom-coach-Downing-claims-Anelka-paying-homage-comedian-controversial-celebration.html|title=Anelka 'Nazi' salute storm - striker could face lengthy FA ban for offensive goal celebration - Daily Mail Online|author=|date=28 December 2013|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, French authorities have said the gesture is too vague to take any action against Dieudonné.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/french-use-nazi-like-salute-with-impunity/|title=French use Nazi-like salute with impunity|author=|date=|work=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, the French Minister for Sport [[Valérie Fourneyron]] publicly criticised the footballer [[Nicolas Anelka]] for using the gesture as a goal celebration in an [[English Premier League]] match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25537686|title=Nicolas Anelka: West Brom striker defends goal celebration|author=|date=|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; French international and [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] [[basketball]] player [[Tony Parker]] also came under fire during the same time period for his use of the gesture.&lt;ref name="parker"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/spurs-parker-fire-anti-semitic-quenelle-gesture-article-1.1561092 |title=Spurs guard Tony Parker under fire for 'quenelle' gesture, alleged anti-Semitism |last=Abramson |first=Mitch |date=29 December 2013 |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December 2013, Parker apologized for making the gesture, saying that the photograph had been taken three years earlier and that he had been unaware at the time that it had any anti-Semitic connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/10216051/tony-parker-san-antonio-spurs-sorry-controversial-photo|title=Tony Parker of San Antonio Spurs sorry for controversial photo|author=|date=|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official January 2014 circular issued by Interior Minister [[Manuel Valls]] besides laying out a legal justification for banning antisemitic performances by Dieudonné also specifically linked the quenelle gesture to anti-Semitism and extremism.&lt;ref name="Valls-circular" /&gt;

{{Literature}}
The '''dime novel''' is a form of late 19th-century and early 20th-century U.S. popular fiction issued in series of inexpensive paperbound editions. The term ''dime novel'' has been used as a catchall term for several different but related forms, referring to [[story paper]]s, five- and ten-cent weeklies, "thick book" reprints, and sometimes early [[pulp magazine]]s.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The English equivalents were generally called [[penny dreadful]]s or shilling shockers. The German and French equivalents were called "Groschenromane" and "livraisons à dix centimes", respectively. American firms also issued foreign editions of many of their works, especially as series characters came into vogue.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used as a title as late as 1940, in the short-lived pulp magazine ''Western Dime Novels''. In the modern age, the term ''dime novel'' has been used to refer to quickly written, lurid [[potboiler]]s, usually as a [[pejorative]] to describe a sensationalized but superficial literary work.

== History ==
[[File:Malaeska.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Malaeska, the Indian Wife of the White Hunter'' (1860)]]
In 1860, the publishers Erastus and Irwin Beadle released a new series of cheap paperbacks, ''Beadle's Dime Novels''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyons|Lyons (2011)]], p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dime novel'' became a general term for similar paperbacks produced by various publishers in the early twentieth century. The first book in the Beadle series was ''Malaeska, the Indian Wife of the White Hunter'', by [[Ann S. Stephens]], dated June 9, 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyons|Lyons (2011)]], p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was essentially a reprint of Stephens's earlier serial, which had appeared in the ''Ladies' Companion'' magazine in February, March and April 1839. It sold more than 65,000 copies in the first few months after its publication as a dime novel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyons|Lyons (2011)]], pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt; Dime novels varied in size, even in the first Beadle series, but were mostly about {{convert|6.5|by|4.25|in|cm}}, with 100 pages. The first 28 were published without a cover illustration, in a salmon-colored paper wrapper. A woodblock print was added in issue 29, and the first 28 were reprinted with illustrated covers. The books were priced, of course, at ten cents.

This series ran for 321 issues and established almost all the conventions of the genre, from the lurid and outlandish story to the melodramatic double titling used throughout the series, which ended in the 1920s. Most of the stories were frontier tales reprinted from the numerous serials in the story papers and other sources,&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Lax copyright enforcement allowed the publication of many foreign literary works without payment of royalties.&lt;/ref&gt; but many were original stories.

As the popularity of dime novels increased, original stories came to be the norm. The books were reprinted many times, sometimes with different covers, and the stories were often further reprinted in different series and by different publishers.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The proliferation of reprints has been a source of confusion about first printings. As a general rule, the date of the printing can be determined from the other titles in the series listed on the back cover. Dime novels were issued in twos or sometimes fours, so a first printing does not list more than three numbers beyond the number on the cover, whereas a later printing may list a hundred titles beyond the cover number. The books are so rare now that the lateness of the printing does not much affect their price.&lt;/ref&gt;

The literacy rate increased around the time of the [[American Civil War]], and ''Beadle's Dime Novels'' were immediately popular among young, working-class readers. By the end of the war, numerous competitors, such as George Munro and Robert DeWitt, were crowding the field, distinguishing their product only by title and the color of the paper wrappers. Beadle &amp; Adams had their own alternate "brands", such as the Frank Starr line. As a whole, the quality of the fiction was derided by highbrow critics, and the term ''dime novel'' came to refer to any form of cheap, sensational fiction, rather than the specific format.

Nonetheless, the pocket-sized sea, Western, railway, circus, gold-digger, and other adventures were an instant success. Author Armin Jaemmrich observes that [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]'s theses in [[Democracy in America]] (1835) says that in democratic and socially permeable societies, like that of the U.S., the lower classes were not "naturally indifferent to science, literature, and the arts: only it must be acknowledged that they cultivate them after their own fashion, and bring to the task their own peculiar qualifications and deficiencies." He found that in aristocratic societies education and interest in literature were confined to a small upper class, and that the literary class would arrive at a "sort of aristocratic jargon, ... hardly less remote from pure language than was the coarse dialect of the people."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jaemmrich|Jaemmrich (2016)]], Chapter XIII.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tocqueville, due to the heterogeneity of its population, the situation in the U.S. was different, and people were asking for reading matter. Since, in his view, practically every American was busy earning a living with no time for obtaining a higher education let alone for timeconsuming distractions, they preferred books which "may be easily procured, quickly read, and which require no learned researches to be understood ... they require rapid emotions, startling passages .... Small productions will be more common than bulky books ... The object of authors will be to astonish rather than to please, and to stir the passions more than to charm the taste." Written twenty-five years prior to the emergence of the dimes, his words read like an exact anticipation of their main characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jaemmrich|Jaemmrich (2016)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prices ===

Adding to the general confusion as to what is or is not a dime novel, many of the series, though similar in design and subject, cost ten to fifteen cents. Beadle &amp; Adams complicated the matter by issuing some titles in the same salmon-colored covers at different prices. Also, there were a number of ten-cent, paper-covered books of the period that featured medieval romance stories and melodramatic tales. This makes it hard to define what falls in the category of the dime novel, with classification depending on format, price, or style of material. Examples of dime novel series that illustrate the diversity of the form include ''Bunce's Ten Cent Novels'', ''Brady's Mercury Stories'', ''Beadle's Dime Novels'', Irwin P. Beadle's ''Ten Cent Stories'', ''Munro's Ten Cent Novels'', ''Dawley's Ten Penny Novels'', ''Fireside Series'', ''Chaney's Union Novels'','' DeWitt's Ten Cent Romances'', ''Champion Novels'', ''Frank Starr's American Novels'', ''Ten Cent Novelettes'', ''Richmond's Sensation Novels'', and ''Ten Cent Irish Novels''.
[[Image:NewDime.jpg|thumb|right|The ''New Dime Novel Series'' introduced color covers but reprinted stories from the original series]]
In 1874, Beadle &amp; Adams added the novelty of color to the covers when their ''New Dime Novels'' series replaced the flagship title. The ''New Dime Novels'' were issued with a dual numbering system on the cover, one continuing the numbering from the first series and the second and more prominent one indicating the number in the current series; for example, the first issue was numbered 1 (322). The stories were mostly reprints from the first series. Like its predecessor, Beadle's ''New Dime Novels'' ran for 321 issues, until 1885.

=== Development ===

Much of the content of dime novels came from [[story paper]]s, which were weekly, eight-page newspaper-like publications, varying in size from tabloid to full-size newspaper format and usually costing five or six cents. They started in the mid-1850s and were immensely popular, some titles being issued for over fifty years on a weekly schedule. They are perhaps best described as the television of their day, containing a variety of serial stories and articles, with something aimed at each member of the family, and often illustrated profusely with woodcuts. Popular story papers included ''The Saturday Journal'', ''Young Men of America'', ''Golden Weekly'', ''Golden Hours'', ''Good News'', and ''Happy Days''.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;There were English story papers as well, containing much the same sort of content. The stories were similarly reprinted in various other formats.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the stories in dime novels stood alone, but in the late 1880s series characters began to appear and quickly grew in popularity. The original [[Frank Reade]] stories first appeared in ''Boys of New York''. The Old Sleuth, appearing in ''The Fireside Companion'' story paper beginning in 1872, was the first dime-novel detective and began the trend away from the western and frontier stories that dominated the story papers and dime novels up to that time. He was the first character to use the word ''sleuth'' to denote a detective, the word's original definition being that of a bloodhound trained to track. He is also responsible for the popularity of the use of the word ''old'' in the names of competing dime novel detectives, such as Old Cap Collier, Old Broadbrim, Old King Brady, Old Lightning, and Old Ferret, among many others. [[Nick Carter (literary character)|Nick Carter]] first appeared in 1886 in the ''[[New York Weekly]]''. Frank Reade, the Old Sleuth and Nick Carter had their own ten-cent weekly titles within a few years.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Nick Carter has proved to be one of the most durable, if bland, fictional characters of all time. In one incarnation or another, he has been active for over 100 years, most recently as Nick Carter, Killmaster, in a long-running paperback series.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Old Sleuth 40 pt 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Old Sleuth Library'', 1888]]

=== Changing formats ===

In 1873, the house of Beadle &amp; Adams introduced a new ten-cent format, {{convert|9|x|13.25|in|mm}}, with only 32 pages and a black-and-white illustration on the cover, under the title ''New and Old Friends''. It was not a success, but the format was so much cheaper to produce that they tried again in 1877 with ''The Fireside Library'' and ''Frank Starr's New York Library''. The first reprinted English love stories, the second contained hardier material, but both titles caught on. Publishers were no less eager to follow a new trend then than now. Soon the newsstands were flooded by ten-cent weekly "libraries". These publications also varied in size, from as small as 7 x 10&amp;nbsp;inches (''The Boy's Star Library'' is an example) to 8.5 x 12 (''New York Detective Library''). The ''Old Cap Collier Library'' was issued in both sizes and also in booklet form. Each issue tended to feature a single story, unlike the story papers, and many of them were devoted to a single character. Frontier stories, evolving into westerns, were still popular, but the new vogue tended to urban crime stories. One of the most successful titles, [[Frank Tousey]]'s ''New York Detective Library'' eventually came to alternate stories of the James Gang with stories of Old King Brady, detective, and (in a rare occurrence in the dime novel) several stories which featured both, with Old King Brady doggedly on the trail of the vicious gang.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Nick Carter was also a character in stories featuring other detectives, such as Old Broadbrim, much as superheroes crossover in today's comic books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition was fierce, and publishers were always looking for an edge. Once again, color came into play when Frank Tousey introduced a weekly with brightly colored covers in 1896. Street &amp; Smith countered by issuing a weekly in a smaller format with muted colors. Such titles as ''New Nick Carter Weekly'' (continuing the original black-and-white ''Nick Carter Library''), ''Tip-Top Weekly'' (introducing [[Frank Merriwell]]) and others were 7 x 10 inches with thirty-two pages of text, but the 8.5 x 11 Tousey format carried the day, and Street &amp; Smith soon followed suit. The price was also dropped to five cents, making the magazines more accessible to children. This would be the last major permutation of the product before it evolved into pulp magazines. Ironically, for many years it has been the nickel weeklies that most people refer to when using the term ''dime novel''. [[Image:Secret Service COLOR.jpg|thumb|right| One of the most popular color-covered nickel weeklies, ''Secret Service'', no. 225, May 15, 1903]]
The nickel weeklies were popular, and their numbers grew quickly. Frank Tousey and Street &amp; Smith dominated the field. Tousey had his "big six": ''Work and Win'' (featuring Fred Fearnot, a serious rival to the soon-to-be-popular Frank Merriwell), ''Secret Service'', ''Pluck and Luck'', ''Wild West Weekly'', ''[[Fame and Fortune Weekly]]'', and ''The Liberty Boys of '76'', each of which issued over a thousand copies weekly.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Several shorter runs are among the most collectible today: ''Frank Reade Weekly'' (the color-cover followup to the ''Frank Reade Library'') and ''The James Boys''.&lt;/ref&gt; Street &amp; Smith had ''New Nick Carter Weekly'', ''Tip Top Weekly'', ''Buffalo Bill Stories'', ''Jesse James Stories'', ''Brave &amp; Bold Weekly'' and many others. The Tousey stories were generally the more lurid and sensational of the two.

Perhaps the most confusing of the various formats lumped together under the term ''dime novel'' are the so-called "thick-book" series, most of which were published by Street &amp; Smith, J. S. Ogilvie and Arthur Westbrook. These books were published in series, contained roughly 150 to 200 pages, and were {{convert|4.75|x|7|in|mm}}, often with color covers on a higher-grade stock. They reprinted multiple stories from the five- and ten-cent weeklies, often slightly rewritten to tie them together.

[[Image:AmDetSeries no. 21.jpg|thumb|left|An example of a "thick book" series, ''American Detective Series'', no. 21, Arthur Westbrook Co.]]

All dime-novel publishers were canny about reusing and refashioning material, but Street &amp; Smith excelled at it. They developed the practice of publishing four consecutive, related tales of, for example, Nick Carter, in the weekly magazine, then combining the four stories into one edition of the related thick-book series, in this instance, the ''New Magnet Library''.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;In addition, Street &amp; Smith bought the rights to other detective stories and had them strung together and rewritten into Nick Carter stories, allowing the ''New Magnet Library'' to run for over 1000 issues.&lt;/ref&gt; The Frank Merriwell stories appeared in the ''Medal, New Medal'' and ''Merriwell'' libraries, Buffalo Bill in the ''Buffalo Bill Library'' and ''Far West Library'', and so on. The thick books were still in print as late as the 1930s but carry the copyright date of the original story, often as early as the late nineteenth century, leading some dealers and new collectors today to erroneously assume they have original dime novels when the books are only distantly related.

=== Demise ===

In 1896, Frank Munsey had converted his juvenile magazine ''The Argosy'' into a fiction magazine for adults, the first of the pulp magazines. By the turn of the century, new high-speed printing techniques combined with cheaper pulp paper allowed him to drop the price from twenty-five cents to ten cents, and sales of the magazine took off.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyons|Lyons (2011)]], p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 Street and Smith converted two of their nickel weeklies, ''New Tip Top Weekly'' and ''Top Notch Magazine'', into pulps; in 1915, ''Nick Carter Stories'', itself a replacement for the ''New Nick Carter Weekly'', became ''Detective Story Magazine'', and in 1919, ''New Buffalo Bill Weekly'' became ''[[Western Story Magazine]]''. Harry Wolff, the successor in interest to the Frank Tousey titles, continued to reprint many of them into the mid-1920s, most notably ''Secret Service, Pluck and Luck, Fame and Fortune'' and ''Wild West Weekly''. These two series were purchased by Street &amp; Smith in 1926 and converted into pulp magazines the following year, effectively ending the era of the dime novel.

A '''Director of Bands''' is the head figure of a marching or concert form of bands, a person who leads a musical ensemble. The Director, by history and tradition, must know all the concepts of music and must be able to teach all different kinds of instrumental musicians in order to make a performance at a certain dateline before the scheduled performance.

==Education==
Most students attend a four-year university to earn a [[Bachelor's degree]] in music. Degrees earned after a Bachelor's are a [[Master's degree]] in music and a Doctoral degree in music. The ones that earn a [[Doctor of Music]] usually seek a professorship at an institution of higher learning.

==Conducting techniques==
Conducting is a means of communicating real-time information to performers. There are no absolute rules on how to conduct correctly, and a wide variety of different conducting styles exist. The primary responsibilities of the conductor are to set the tempo, execute clear preparations and beats, and to listen and shape the sound of the ensemble.

An understanding of the basic elements of musical expression ([[tempo]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Articulation (music)|articulation]]) and the ability to communicate them effectively to an ensemble is necessary in order to conduct. The ability to communicate nuances of phrasing and expression through gesture is also beneficial. Conducting gestures may be choreographed beforehand by the conductor while studying the [[sheet music|score]], or may be spontaneous.

A distinction is sometimes made between orchestral conducting and choral conducting. [[Stereotype|Stereotypically]], orchestral conductors use a [[baton (conducting)|baton]] more often than choral conductors (though not always: this is up to the conductor's personal preference), and favor the use of [[beat pattern]]s over gestural conducting, which concentrates more on musical expression and shape. 

The grip of the [[baton (conducting)|baton]] is a contentious issue that varies from conductor to conductor. Despite a wide variety of styles, a number of standard conventions have developed.

'''''Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Don Juan ou Si Don Juan était une femme...'''}}) is a 1973 French-Italian [[drama film]] by [[Roger Vadim]]. It sees Vadim reunite with his leading lady and ex-wife [[Brigitte Bardot]] for their fifth film together. Bardot achieved international stardom and Vadim got his break when he directed her in the 1956 sensation, ''[[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|And God Created Woman]]''. It was her second to last film before retiring.&lt;ref&gt;Newsmakers----: Comic Finds Ford Hard Act to Follow Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 18 Apr 1976: a2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Jeanne (Bardot) plays a modern-day [[Don Juan]]–styled woman who prides herself in the destruction of men who have fallen for her charms. She reveals to a priest a murder she committed and frankly details her past sexual encounters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/don_juan_or_if_don_juan_were_a_woman/ Don Juan (Or If Don Juan Were a Woman) (1973)] Rotten Tomatoes.

==Production==
Roger Vadim said in an interview after the film came out:
&lt;blockquote&gt;My attitude to women is accepted today in a way that it wasn't when I started out as director. But today woman overreact - they pretend to be free on an intellectual and sexual level but because of our Christian traditions sex is always associated with guilt. Now however it's possible for a woman to have the same relationship with sex as a man - a man who is a lover can be a Don Juan whereas women like that were always considered whores or femmes faciles (easy women). But I think a woman can be free without being a whore. A female Don Juan can exist nowadays without a sense of guilt.&lt;ref name="vadim"&gt;ROGER VADIM
Wilson, Timothy. The Guardian (1959-2003) [London (UK)] 07 Apr 1973: 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He later elaborated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Don Juan'' is the end of a period - problems about love and sex, cruelty and romanticism on an aesthetic level - and I wanted to finish that period with Brigitte because I started with her as a director (''And God Created Woman''). Underneath what people call "the Bardot myth" was something interesting, even though she was never considered the most professional actress in the world. For years, since she has been growing older, and the Bardot myth has become just a souvenir, I wanted to work with Brigitte. I was curious in her as a woman and I had to get to the end of something with her, to get out of her and express many things I felt were in her. Brigitte always gave the impression of sexual freedom - she is a completely open and free person, without any aggression. So I gave her the part of a man - that amused me.&lt;ref name="vadim"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Vadim said he was attracted to the character of Don Juan was "the sense of defiance on every level. Its someone who refuses to be involved in any system. In the film it's a woman who defies men - and I do the film like the character - against all the rules."&lt;ref name="vadim"/&gt;
Vadim says he deliberately pulled back on the sex scenes. "I was interested in the idea of seduction, not what happened in bed - though I would love to make a documentary on how they fucked."&lt;ref name="vadim"/&gt;

Jane Birkin plays the role of a woman who falls in love with Brigitte Bardot's character. "I accepted immediately just to be in bed with Bardot," said Birkin later. "She's the most utterly perfect woman. There's not a fault. God knows, I looked. Even her feet are pretty."&lt;ref&gt;When a small front need not hold you back
Mills, Nancy. The Guardian (1959-2003) [London (UK)] 11 Oct 1977: 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

"If there's homosexuality between men they have to be queer," said Vadim. "But women can have relationships with other women without being dykes. Brigitte seduced this girl to hit the man and the girl is enchanted not to be treated as a sex object for once in her life."&lt;ref name="vadim"/&gt;

"If ''Don Juan'' is not my last movie it will be my next to last," said Bardot during filming.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Bardot: No longer a sex symbol
Morgan, Gwen. Chicago Tribune (1963-Current file) [Chicago, Ill] 04 Mar 1973: d3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film received poor reviews in France.&lt;ref name="vadim"/&gt;

The ''Guardian'' said the movie, "like so many of his [Vadim's] films, has some beautiful photography and slick editing but few plausible scenes. Incapable of creating an illusion, Vadim is eminently capable of creating an illusion of creativity."&lt;ref name="vadim"/&gt; "It stinks" said another review for the same paper.&lt;ref&gt;Putting on the Fritz: Derek Malcolm reviews the new films

'''Exhibit design''' (or '''exhibition design'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Exhibition Design | publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] | author=Dernie, David | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-393-73211-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the process of developing an exhibit—from a concept through to a physical, three-dimensional exhibition. It is a continually evolving field, drawing on innovative, creative, and practical solutions to the challenge of developing communicative environments that ‘tell a story’ in a three-dimensional space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/course/xmdxmdma/ MA Design for Exhibition and Museum], [[University of Lincoln]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Exhibit designer]]s (or [[exhibition designer]]s) use a wide range of technologies and techniques to develop experiences that will resonate with diverse audiences–enabling these targeted audiences to access the messages, stories and objects of an exhibit.
There are many different types of exhibit, ranging from museum exhibitions, to retail and trades show spaces, to themed attractions, zoos, and visitor centers. All types of exhibits aim to communicate a message through engaging their audiences in meaningful and compelling interactions.
   
Exhibit design is a collaborative process, integrating the disciplines of [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[graphic design]], [[audiovisual]] engineering, [[digital media]], [[lighting designer|lighting]], [[interior design]], and content development to develop an audience experience that interprets information, involves and engages a user and influences their understanding of a subject.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Skolnick, [[Jan Lorenc]], and Craig Berger, ''What is Exhibition Design?'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the planning and design process, exhibit designers work closely with [[graphic designers]], content specialists, [[architects]], fabricators, technical specialists, audiovisual experts, and, in the case of museums and other [[mission statement|mission]]-based institutions, stakeholders like community members, government agencies, and other partner organizations.
  
The exhibit design process builds on a conceptual or [[interpretive planning|interpretive plan]] for an exhibit, determining the most effective, engaging and appropriate methods of communicating a message or telling a story. The process will often mirror the architectural process or schedule, moving from conceptual plan, through schematic design, design development, contract document, fabrication, and installation. The first phases establish a thematic direction and develop creative and appropriate design solutions to achieve the interpretive and communication goals of the exhibit. The latter phases employ technical expertise in translating the visual language of the designs into detailed documents that provide all the specifications required to fabricate and install an exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781442230170/Museums-101|title=Museums 101|last=Walhimer|first=Mark|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2015|isbn=9781442230187|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibition design in different parts of the world are influenced by the local culture as well as the availability of materials. Exhibition design in Europe is considered as a meeting place for relationship building while in North America energy is spent on creating a sense of place and building community.

One of the major shifts in museum and exhibit design in the last decade has been a focus on visitor experience.  By identifying the five types of museum visitors and their needs and expectations, museums can design their exhibits to give a positive visitor experience.&lt;ref&gt;John Falk, ''Identity and the museum visitor experience''2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Participatory activities are also becoming more popular, Nina Simon has done research describing and identifying themes and trends in museums that will attract visitors and educate them in fun and engaging ways. &lt;ref&gt;Nina Simon, ''The Participatory Museum'' 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus''''' is a [[novel]] written by English author [[Mary Shelley]] (1797–1851) that tells the story of [[Victor Frankenstein]], a young scientist who creates a hideous, [[Sapience|sapient]] [[Frankenstein's monster|creature]] in an unorthodox scientific experiment. Shelley started writing the story when she was 18, and the first edition of the novel was published anonymously in London on 1 January 1818, when she was 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff writer |date=1 January 1818 |title=Books Published This Day |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/32751068 |newspaper=The Times |location=London, England |issue=10342 |page=4 |quote=This day is published, in 3 vols., price 16s. 6d., a Work of Imagination, to be entitled Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name first appeared on the second edition, published in 1823.

Shelley travelled through Europe in 1814, journeying along the river [[Rhine]] in Germany with a stop in [[Gernsheim]], which is {{convert|17|km}} away from [[Frankenstein Castle]], where, two centuries before, an [[alchemist]] was engaged in experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbler, Dorthy and Thomas. ''The Monsters: Mary Shelley and the Curse of Frankenstein''. Back Bay Books; 20 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Martin. ''Mary Shelley''. Oxford University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seymour, Miranda. ''Mary Shelley''. Atlanta, GA: Grove Press, 2002. pg 110-111&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she travelled in the region of [[Geneva]] (Switzerland)—where much of the story takes place—and the topic of [[galvanism]] and [[occult]] ideas were themes of conversation among her companions, particularly her lover and future husband, [[Percy Shelley]]. Mary, Percy and [[Lord Byron]] decided to have a competition to see who could write the best [[Horror fiction|horror]] story. After thinking for days, Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made; her dream later evolved into the novel's story.

''Frankenstein'' is infused with elements of the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic novel]] and the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement. At the same time, it is an early example of [[science fiction]]. [[Brian Aldiss]] has argued that it should be considered the first true science fiction story because, in contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction, the central character "makes a deliberate decision" and "turns to modern experiments in the laboratory" to achieve fantastic results.&lt;ref&gt;''The Detached Retina: Aspects of SF and Fantasy'' by Brian Aldiss (1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=N1WWSRVeOC8C&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage page 78].&lt;/ref&gt; It has had a considerable influence in literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of [[horror fiction|horror]] stories, films and plays.

Since the novel's publication, the name "Frankenstein" has often been used to refer to the monster itself. This usage is sometimes considered erroneous, but usage commentators regard it as well-established and acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen Evans, ''Comfortable Words'', New York: Random House, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Garner, ''A Dictionary of Modern American Usage'', New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of American English'', Merriam-Webster: 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel, the monster is identified by words such as "creature", "monster", "demon", "wretch", "abortion", "fiend" and "it". Speaking to Victor Frankenstein, the monster says "I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel" (which ties to [[Lucifer]] in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', which the monster reads, and which relates to the disobedience of [[Prometheus]] in the book's subtitle).

==Summary==

''Frankenstein'' is written in the form of a [[frame story]] that starts with Captain Robert Walton writing letters to his sister. It takes place at an unspecified time in the 18th century, as the letters' dates are given as "17—". In the story following the letters by Walton, the readers find that Victor Frankenstein creates a monster that brings tragedy to his life.

===Captain Walton's introductory frame narrative===
The novel ''Frankenstein'' is written in [[Epistolary novel|epistolary form]], documenting a fictional correspondence between Captain Robert Walton and his sister, Margaret Walton Saville. Walton is a failed writer and captain who sets out to explore the [[North Pole]] and expand his scientific knowledge in hopes of achieving fame. During the voyage, the crew spots a dog sled driven by a gigantic figure. A few hours later, the crew rescues a nearly frozen and emaciated man named [[Victor Frankenstein]]. Frankenstein has been in pursuit of the gigantic man observed by Walton's crew. Frankenstein starts to recover from his exertion; he sees in Walton the same obsession that has destroyed him, and recounts a story of his life's miseries to Walton as a warning. The recounted story serves as the frame for Frankenstein's narrative.

===Victor Frankenstein's narrative===

Victor begins by telling of his childhood. Born in [[Naples]], Italy, into a wealthy [[Geneva]]n family, Victor and his brothers, Ernest and William, all three being sons of Alphonse Frankenstein by the former Caroline Beaufort, are encouraged to seek a greater understanding of the world through chemistry. As a young boy, Victor is obsessed with studying outdated theories that focus on simulating natural wonders. When Victor is five years old, his parents adopt [[Elizabeth Lavenza]], the orphaned daughter of an expropriated Italian nobleman, with whom Victor (allegedly) later falls in love. During this period, Victor's parents, Alphonse and Caroline, take in yet another orphan, Justine Moritz, who becomes William's nanny.

Weeks before he leaves for the [[University of Ingolstadt]] in Germany, his mother dies of [[scarlet fever]]; Victor buries himself in his experiments to deal with the grief. At the university, he excels at chemistry and other sciences, soon developing a secret technique to impart life to non-living matter. Eventually, he undertakes the creation of a humanoid, but due to the difficulty in replicating the minute parts of the human body, Victor makes the Creature tall, about {{convert|8|ft}} in height and proportionally large. Despite Victor selecting its features as beautiful, upon animation the creature is instead hideous, with watery white eyes and yellow skin that barely conceals the muscles and blood vessels underneath. Repulsed by his work, Victor flees when it awakens. While wandering the streets, he meets his childhood friend, Henry Clerval, and takes Henry back to his apartment, fearful of Henry's reaction if he sees the monster. However, the Creature has escaped.

Victor falls ill from the experience and is nursed back to health by Henry. After a four-month recovery, he returns home when he learns of the murder of his brother William. Upon arriving in Geneva, Victor sees the Creature near the crime scene and climbing a mountain, leading him to believe his creation is responsible. Justine Moritz, William's nanny, is convicted of the crime after William's locket, which had contained a miniature portrait of Caroline, is found in her pocket. Victor is helpless to stop her from being hanged, as he knows no one would believe his story.

Ravaged by grief and guilt, Victor retreats into the mountains. The Creature finds him and pleads for Victor to hear his tale.

=== The Creature's narrative ===
Intelligent and articulate, [[Frankenstein's monster|the Creature]] relates his first days of life, living alone in the wilderness and finding that people were afraid of and hated him due to his appearance, which led him to fear and hide from them. While living in an abandoned structure connected to a cottage, he grew fond of the poor family living there, and discreetly collected firewood for them. Secretly living among the family for months, the Creature learned to speak by listening to them and he taught himself to read after discovering a lost satchel of books in the woods. When he saw his reflection in a pool, he realized his physical appearance was hideous, and it terrified him as it terrifies normal humans. Nevertheless, he approached the family in hopes of becoming their friend. Initially he was able to befriend the blind father figure of the family, but the rest of them were frightened and they all fled their home, resulting in the Creature leaving, disappointed. He traveled to Victor's family estate using details from Victor's journal, murdered William, and framed Justine.

The Creature demands that Victor create a female companion like himself. He argues that as a living being, he has a right to happiness. The Creature promises that he and his mate will vanish into the South American wilderness, never to reappear, if Victor grants his request. Should Victor refuse his request, The Creature also threatens to kill Victor's remaining friends and loved ones and not stop until he completely ruins him.

Fearing for his family, Victor reluctantly agrees. The Creature says he will watch over Victor's progress.

=== Victor Frankenstein's narrative resumes ===
Clerval accompanies him to [[England]], but they separate at Victor's insistence at [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Scotland]]. Victor suspects that the Creature is following him. Working on the female creature on the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]], he is plagued by premonitions of disaster, such as the female hating the Creature or becoming more evil than him, but more particularly the two creatures might lead to the breeding of a race that could plague mankind. He tears apart the unfinished female creature after he sees the Creature, who had indeed followed Victor, watching through a window. The Creature later confronts and tries to threaten Victor into working again, but Victor is convinced that the Creature is evil and that its mate would be evil as well, and the pair would threaten all humanity. Victor destroys his work and the Creature vows that he will "be with [him] on [his] wedding night". Victor interprets this as a threat upon his life, believing that the Creature will kill him after he finally becomes happy. When Victor lands in [[Ireland]], he is soon imprisoned for Clerval's murder, as the Creature had strangled Clerval to death and left the corpse to be found where his creator had arrived, causing the latter to suffer another mental breakdown in prison. After being acquitted, Victor returns home with his father, who has restored to Elizabeth some of her father's fortune.

In Geneva, Victor is about to marry Elizabeth and prepares to fight the Creature to the death, arming himself with pistols and a dagger. The night following their wedding, Victor asks Elizabeth to stay in her room while he looks for "the fiend". While Victor searches the house and grounds, the Creature strangles Elizabeth to death. From the window, Victor sees the Creature, who tauntingly points at Elizabeth's corpse; Victor tries to shoot him, but the Creature escapes. After Victor gets back to Geneva, Victor's father, weakened by age and by the death of his precious Elizabeth, dies a few days later. Seeking revenge, Victor pursues the Creature to the [[North Pole]], but collapses from exhaustion and [[hypothermia]] before he can find his quarry.

===Captain Walton's conclusion===
At the end of Victor's narrative, Captain Walton resumes the telling of the story, closing the frame around Victor's recounting. A few days after the Creature vanished, the ship becomes trapped in [[pack ice]] and multiple crewmen die in the cold, before the rest of Walton's crew insists on returning south once it is freed. Upon hearing the crew's pleas to their captain, Victor, angered, lectures them with a powerful speech: it is hardship, not comfort and easiness, that defines a glorious undertaking such as theirs; he urges them to be men, not cowards. The ship is freed and Walton, owing it to the will of his men, albeit regretfully, decides to return South. Victor, even though in very weak condition, states that he will go on by himself.

Victor dies shortly thereafter, telling Walton, with his last words, to seek "happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition". Walton discovers the Creature on his ship, mourning over Victor's body. The Creature tells Walton that Victor's death has not brought him peace; rather, his crimes have left him completely alone. The Creature vows to kill himself so that no others will ever know of his existence. Walton watches as the Creature drifts away on an ice raft that is soon "lost in darkness and distance", never to be seen again.

== Background ==
The author, [[Mary Shelley]], had a tragic life from the beginning. Shelley's mother, [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], died shortly after giving birth to her. Since Shelley did not know her mother it made her have a close attachment to her father. Shelley's father, [[William Godwin]], hired a nurse to care for her and her half sister but she left and her father ended up remarrying. Shelley's stepmother did not like the close bond Shelley had with her father. This caused Godwin to favor his other two daughters and sons. However, none of the neglect stopped Shelley from becoming the great female author she was.

Her father was a famous author himself and her education was of great importance. Shelley grew up surrounded by many different writers and persons of political importance because of her father. This inspired her authorship at an early age. Shelley met [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], who later became her husband, at the age of sixteen while he was visiting with her father at their home. Her father did not agree with their relationship so they fled to France along with her sister, Jane.  Later, she gave birth to their first child and soon after lost the child.

Both Mary and Percy went away with Jane to visit her lover [[Lord Byron]], in [[Geneva]] during the summer. Percy and Mary became good friends with Byron and used their time with him to discuss literature, politics, and science. One evening after being trapped in the house because of storms Byron suggested they all have a competition of writing the best ghost story. This is how Frankenstein was brought to life. Mary was eighteen years old when she wrote this novel. Shelley won the contest by her creation of the novel, Frankenstein. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/frankenstein/exhibition1.html|title=Frankenstein: Penetrating the Secrets of Nature: The Birth of Frankenstein|website=www.nlm.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Badalamenti|first=Anthony|date=Fall 2006|title=Why did Mary Shelley Write Frankenstein|jstor=27512949|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|volume=45|pages=419–439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literary Influences ===
[[File:House of Lord Byron in Geneva.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:House%20of%20Lord%20Byron%20in%20Geneva.jpg|alt=Home of Lord Byron where Frankenstein was created|thumb|Lord Bryon's Home in Geneva.]]
Shelley was heavily influenced by both of her parents works. Her father was famous for [[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]] and her mother famous for [[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]. Her father's novels also influenced her writing of ''Frankenstein''. These novels included [[Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams]], ''St. Leon,'' and ''Fleetwood''. All of these books were set in Switzerland, similar to the setting in Frankenstein. Some major themes of social affections and the renewal of life that appear in Shelley's novel stem from these works she had in her possession. Other literary influences that appear in ''Frankenstein'' are [[Pygmalion (play)]] and  [[Ovid]]  with the use of an individual lacking intelligence and those individuals identifying the problems with society. Ovid also inspires the use of [[Prometheus]] in Shelley's title.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pollin|first=Burton|date=Spring 1965|title=Philisophical and Literary Sources of Frankenstein|journal=Comparative Literature|volume=17|pages=97–108|jstor=1769997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her time spent with Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, her baby, and her sister Jane influenced her creation of Frankenstein as well. Percy and Bryon's discussion on life and death surrounded many scientific geniuses of the time. They discussed ideas from [[Charles Darwin]] and the experiments from [[Luigi Galvani]]. Mary listened intently to these conversations and the ideas of Darwin and Galvani were both present in her novel. The horrors of not being able to write a story for the contest and her hard life also influenced the themes within ''Frankenstein.'' The themes of loss , guilt, and the consequences of defying nature present in the novel all developed from Mary Shelley's own life. The loss of her mother, the relationship with her father, and the death of her first child created the monster and his separation from parental guidance. Guilt stemmed from her not feeling good enough for Percy because of the loss of their child.   &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote|How I, then a young girl, came to think of, and to dilate upon, so very hideous an idea?|Mary Shelley&lt;ref&gt;"Preface", 1831 edition of ''Frankenstein''&lt;/ref&gt;}}During the rainy summer of 1816, the "[[Year Without a Summer]]", the world was locked in a long cold [[volcanic winter]] caused by the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Shelley]], aged 18, and her lover (and later husband) [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] visited [[Lord Byron]] at the [[Villa Diodati]] by [[Lake Geneva]] in Switzerland. The weather was consistently too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor holiday activities they had planned, so the group retired indoors until dawn.

Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves by reading German ghost stories translated into French from the book ''[[Fantasmagoriana]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Dr. John Polidori, "The Vampyre" 1819, The New Monthly Magazine and Universal Register; London: H. Colburn, 1814–1820. Vol. 1, No. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; then Byron proposed that they "each write a ghost story".&lt;ref&gt;paragraph 7, Introduction, Frankenstein 1831 edition&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to think of a story, young Mary became anxious: "''Have you thought of a story?'' I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative."&lt;ref&gt;paragraph 8, Introduction, Frankenstein 1831 edition&lt;/ref&gt; During one evening in the middle of summer, the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life. "Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated", Mary noted, "[[galvanism]] had given token of such things".&lt;ref&gt;paragraph 10, Introduction, Frankenstein 1831 edition&lt;/ref&gt; It was after midnight before they retired, and unable to sleep, she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the "grim terrors" of her "waking dream".&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, Mary. Paragraphs 11–13, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/42324/42324-h/42324-h.htm "Introduction" ''Frankenstein'' (1831 edition)] Gutenberg&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half vital motion. Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Spark, 157, from Mary Shelley's introduction to the 1831 edition of ''Frankenstein''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In September 2011, astronomer Donald Olson, after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa the previous year and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars, concluded that her "waking dream" took place "between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m." on 16 June 1816, several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story.&lt;ref name="astro"&gt;Radford, Tim, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/26/frankenstein-hour-creation-identified-astronomers Frankenstein's hour of creation identified by astronomers]'', The Guardian, Sunday 25 September 2011 (retrieved 5 January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

She began writing what she assumed would be a short story. With Percy Shelley's encouragement, she expanded the tale into a full-fledged novel.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''An Introduction'', 30–31; Sunstein, 124.&lt;/ref&gt; She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment "when I first stepped out from childhood into life".&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley wrote the first four chapters in the weeks following the suicide of her half-sister Fanny.&lt;ref&gt;Hay, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of many personal tragedies that impacted Shelley's work. Shelley's first child died in infancy, and when she began composing ''Frankenstein'' in 1816, she was likely nursing her second child, who would also be dead at ''Frankenstein''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lepore|first=Jill|date=February 5, 2018|title=The Strange and Twisted Life of 'Frankenstein'|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/the-strange-and-twisted-life-of-frankenstein|journal=The New Yorker|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byron managed to write just a fragment based on the [[vampire]] legends he heard while travelling the [[Balkans]], and from this [[John Polidori]] created ''[[The Vampyre]]'' (1819), the progenitor of the romantic vampire literary genre. Thus two seminal horror tales originated from the conclave.

The group talked about [[Enlightenment (philosophy)|Enlightenment]] and [[Counter-Enlightenment]] ideas as well. Shelley believed the Enlightenment idea that society could progress and grow if political leaders used their powers responsibly; however, she also believed the Romantic ideal that misused power could destroy society (Bennett 36–42).&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Betty T. Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley: An Introduction. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelly wrote much of the book while residing in a lodging house in the centre of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kennedy| first = Mave|title='A 200-year-old secret': plaque to mark Bath's hidden role in Frankenstein|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/26/a-200-year-old-secret-plaque-to-mark-baths-hidden-role-in-frankenstein|publisher=theguardian.com |date=26 February 2018|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelley's manuscripts for the first three-volume edition in 1818 (written 1816–1817), as well as the [[fair copy]] for her publisher, are now housed in the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]].

It was published in an edition of just 500 copies in three volumes, the standard "[[Three-volume novel|triple-decker]]" format for 19th-century first editions.

[[File:Editions of Frankenstein.jpg|thumb|A variety of different editions]]

The second edition of ''Frankenstein'' was published on 11 August 1823 in two volumes (by G. and W. B. Whittaker) following the success of the stage play ''Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein'' by [[Richard Brinsley Peake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qykBJvG0iJQC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3#v=onepage|first= Mary |last=Wollstonecraft Shelley|authorlink=Mary Shelley|title= Frankenstein|publisher= Bedford Publishing |year=2000|page= 3|isbn= 9780312227623 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition credited Mary Shelley as the book's author on its title page.

On 31 October 1831, the first "popular" edition in one-volume appeared, published by [[Henry Colburn]] &amp; Richard Bentley.&lt;ref&gt;See forward to ''Barnes and Noble'' classic edition.&lt;/ref&gt; This edition was heavily revised by Mary Shelley, partially to make the story less radical. It included a lengthy new preface by the author, presenting a somewhat embellished version of the genesis of the story. This edition is the one most widely published and read now, although a few editions follow the 1818 text.&lt;ref&gt;The edition published by ''Forgotten Books'' is the original text, as is the "Ignatius Critical Edition". ''Vintage Books'' has an edition presenting both versions.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars prefer the original version, arguing that it preserves the spirit of Mary Shelley's vision (see Anne K. Mellor's "Choosing a Text of ''Frankenstein'' to Teach" in the [[W. W. Norton]] Critical edition).

In 2008, a new edition of the novel, titled ''The Original Frankenstein'', edited by Charles E. Robinson, was published. Robinson examined the original manuscript by Mary Shelley and noted the edits that Percy Bysshe Shelley made to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-original-frankenstein-by-mary-shelley-with-percy-shelley-ed-charles-e-robinson-1017483.html | title=The Original Frankenstein, By Mary Shelley with Percy Shelley ed Charles E Robinson | work=The Independent | author=James Grande | date=2008-11-25 | accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==Frankenstein and the Monster==

===The Creature===
{{Main|Frankenstein's monster}}
[[File:Punch Anti-Irish propaganda (1882) Irish Frankenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|An English editorial cartoonist conceives the Irish [[Fenian|Fenian movement]] as akin to Frankenstein's creature, in the wake of the [[Phoenix Park murders]] in an 1882 issue of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/frankenstein/escaping.html Frankenstein:Celluloid Monster] at the National Library of Medicine website of the (U.S.) National Institutes of Health&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Part of Frankenstein's rejection of his creation is the fact that he does not give it a name, which causes a lack of identity. Instead it is referred to by words such as "wretch", "monster", "creature", "demon", "devil", "fiend", and "it". When Frankenstein converses with the creature in Chapter 10, he addresses it as "vile insect", "abhorred monster", "fiend", "wretched devil", and "abhorred devil".

During a telling of ''Frankenstein'', Shelley referred to the creature as "[[Adam]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/ppo/currentprograms/frankenstein/exhibittext.pdf |title=Frankenstein: Penetrating the Secrets of Nature / Exhibit Text |publisher=[[National Library of Medicine]] and ALA Public Programs Office |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |accessdate=31 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061204162542/http://www.ala.org/ala/ppo/currentprograms/frankenstein/exhibittext.pdf |archivedate=4 December 2006 |df=dmy }} from the traveling exhibition [http://www.ala.org/ala/ppo/currentprograms/frankenstein/frankensteinpenetrating.cfm Frankenstein: Penetrating the Secrets of Nature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109215920/http://www.ala.org/ala/ppo/currentprograms/frankenstein/frankensteinpenetrating.cfm |date=9 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2017}} Shelley was referring to the [[List of first men or women in mythology and religion|first man]] in the [[Garden of Eden]], as in her epigraph:

:Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay
:To mould Me man? Did I solicit thee
:From darkness to promote me?
::[[John Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (X. 743–5)

Although the creature would be described in later works as a composite of whole body parts grafted together from cadavers and [[reanimation (science fiction)|reanimated]] by the use of [[electricity]], this description is not consistent with Shelley's work; both the use of electricity and the cobbled-together image of Frankenstein's monster were more the result of [[James Whale]]'s popular 1931 [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|film adaptation of the story]], and other early motion-picture works based upon the creature. In Shelley's original work, Dr. Frankenstein discovers a previously unknown but elemental principle of life, and that insight allows him to develop a method to imbue vitality into inanimate matter, though the exact nature of the process is left largely ambiguous. After a great deal of hesitation in exercising this power, Frankenstein spends two years painstakingly constructing the creature's proportionally large body (one anatomical feature at a time, from raw materials supplied by "the dissecting room and the slaughter-house"), which he then brings to life using his unspecified process.

The creature has often been mistakenly called "Frankenstein". In 1908 one author said "It is strange to note how well-nigh universally the term "Frankenstein" is misused, even by intelligent people, as describing some hideous monster".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rBoOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA238 ''Author's Digest: The World's Great Stories in Brief''], by Rossiter Johnson, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edith Wharton]]'s ''[[The Reef (novel)|The Reef]]'' (1916) describes an unruly child as an "infant Frankenstein."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Reef (novel)|The Reef]]'', page 96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]]'s "The Bridal Ornament", published in ''The Rover'', 12 June 1844, mentioned "the maker of poor Frankenstein." After the release of Whale's cinematic ''Frankenstein'', the public at large began speaking of the creature itself as "Frankenstein". This also occurs in Frankenstein films, including ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935) and several subsequent films, as well as in film titles such as ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''. Furthermore, the 1939 film ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' introduced an evil laboratory assistant, Ygor ([[Bela Lugosi]]), who never existed in the original narrative.

===Victor Frankenstein's name===
Mary Shelley maintained that she derived the name ''Frankenstein'' from a dream-vision. Despite her public claims of originality, however, a number of other sources have been suggested as Shelley's actual inspiration. The German name ''Frankenstein'' means "stone of the [[Franks]]", and it is associated with various places in Germany, including [[Frankenstein Castle]] (''Burg Frankenstein'') in [[Darmstadt]], [[Hesse]], and Frankenstein Castle in [[Frankenstein, Rhineland-Palatinate|Frankenstein]], a town in the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]]. There is also a castle called Frankenstein in [[Bad Salzungen]], Thuringia, and a municipality called [[Frankenstein, Saxony|Frankenstein]] in Saxony. Until 1945, [[Ząbkowice Śląskie]], now a city in [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]], [[Poland]], was mainly populated by [[Germans]] and named ''Frankenstein'' in German, and was the site of a [[:pl:Afera grabarzy z Frankenstein|scandal involving gravediggers]] in 1606, which has been suggested as an inspiration to the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historiamniejznanaizapomniana.wordpress.com/2016/01/24/afera-grabarzy-z-frankenstein/|title=Afera grabarzy z Frankenstein|first=Historia|last=zapomniana|date=24 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the name is borne by the aristocratic [[House of Franckenstein]] from [[Franconia]].

[[Radu Florescu]] argues that Mary and Percy Shelley visited Frankenstein Castle near Darmstadt in 1814 during their return to England from their elopement to Switzerland. It was at this castle that a notorious alchemist, [[Johann Conrad Dippel|Conrad Dippel]], had experimented with human bodies, and Florescu reasons that Mary suppressed mention of her visit in order to maintain her public claim of originality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Florescu|1996|pp=48–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A literary essay by A.&amp;nbsp;J. Day supports Florescu's position that Mary Shelley knew of and visited Frankenstein Castle before writing her debut novel.&lt;ref name="Day2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=A.J.|title=Fantasmagoriana (Tales of the Dead)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szyuBymktB4C&amp;pg=PA150|year=2005|publisher=Fantasmagoriana Press|isbn=978-1-4116-5291-0|pages=149–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day includes details of an alleged description of the Frankenstein castle that exists in Mary Shelley's 'lost' journals. According to Jörg Heléne, the 'lost journals', as well as Florescu's claims, cannot be verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://darmundestat.wordpress.com/sonstiges/mary-shelleys-frankenstein-castle-frankenstein-and-the-alchemist-johann-conrad-dippel |title=Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Castle Frankenstein and the alchemist Johann Conrad Dippel |last=Heléne |first=Jörg|date=12 September 2016 |website=Darmstadt |publisher= |access-date=2017-06-23 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible interpretation of the name Victor is derived from ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' by [[John Milton]], a great influence on Shelley (a quotation from ''Paradise Lost'' is on the opening page of ''Frankenstein'' and Shelley even has the monster himself read it).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.upenn.edu/Projects/knarf/Articles/wade.html Wade, Phillip. "Shelley and the Miltonic Element in Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein''."'' Milton and the Romantics'', 2 (December, 1976), 23–25.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|1952|pp=496–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Milton frequently refers to God as "the Victor" in ''Paradise Lost'', and Shelley sees Victor as playing God by creating life. In addition, Shelley's portrayal of the monster owes much to the character of [[Satan]] in ''Paradise Lost''; indeed, the monster says, after reading the epic poem, that he empathizes with Satan's role in the story.

There are many similarities between Victor and Percy Shelley, Mary's husband. Victor was a pen name of Percy Shelley's, as in the collection of poetry he wrote with his sister Elizabeth, ''[[Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Sandy | first =Mark | title =Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire | work =[[The Literary Encyclopedia]]| publisher =The Literary Dictionary Company | date =20 September 2002 | url =http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=3010 | accessdate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is speculation that one of Mary Shelley's models for Victor Frankenstein was Percy, who at Eton had "experimented with electricity and magnetism as well as with gunpowder and numerous chemical reactions", and whose rooms at Oxford were filled with scientific equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822) | publisher =Department of English, [[Dickinson College]] | work=Romantic Natural History | url =http://www.dickinson.edu/~nicholsa/Romnat/pbshelley.htm | accessdate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Percy Shelley was the first-born son of a wealthy country squire with strong political connections and a descendant of Sir [[Bysshe Shelley]], 1st Baronet of [[Castle Goring]], and Richard Fitzalan, 10th [[Earl of Arundel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Percy Shelley#Ancestry]]&lt;/ref&gt; Victor's family is one of the most distinguished of that republic and his ancestors were counselors and [[syndic]]s. Percy had a sister named Elizabeth; Victor had an adopted sister named Elizabeth.

On 22 February 1815, Mary Shelley gave birth to a baby two months prematurely, and the baby died two weeks later. Percy did not care about the condition of this premature infant and left with Claire, Mary's stepsister, for a lurid affair.&lt;ref&gt;"''Journal 6 December''—Very Unwell. Shelley &amp; Clary walk out, as usual, to heaps of places ... A letter from Hookham to say that Harriet has been brought to bed of a son and heir. Shelley writes a number of circular letters on this event, which ought to be ushered in with ringing of bells, etc., for it is the son of his ''wife''." Quoted in Spark, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; When Victor saw the creature come to life he fled the apartment, though the newborn creature approached him, as a child would a parent. The question of Victor's responsibility to the creature is one of the main themes of the book.

===Modern Prometheus===
''The Modern Prometheus'' is the novel's subtitle (though some modern editions now drop the subtitle, mentioning it only in an introduction).&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Longman study edition published in India in 2007 by Pearson Education&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prometheus]], in later versions of Greek mythology, was the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who created mankind at the behest of [[Zeus]]. He made a being in the image of the gods that could have a spirit breathed into it.&lt;ref&gt;In the best-known versions of the Prometheus story, by Hesiod and Aeschylus, Prometheus merely brings fire to mankind. But in other versions, such as several of Aesop's fables (See in particular Fable 516), Sappho (Fragment 207), and Ovid's Metamorphoses, Prometheus is the actual creator of humanity.&lt;/ref&gt; Prometheus taught man to hunt, read, and heal their sick, but after he tricked Zeus into accepting poor-quality offerings from humans, Zeus kept fire from mankind. Prometheus, being the creator, took back the fire from Zeus to give to man. When Zeus discovered this, he sentenced Prometheus to be eternally punished by fixing him to a rock of [[Caucasus]], where each day an eagle would peck out his liver, only for the liver to regrow the next day because of his immortality as a god. He was intended to suffer alone for eternity, but eventually [[Heracles]] ([[Hercules]]) released him.

Prometheus was also a myth told in Latin, but was a very different story. In this version Prometheus makes man from clay and water, again a very relevant theme to ''Frankenstein'', as Victor rebels against the laws of nature (how life is naturally made) and as a result is punished by his creation.

[[File:Frankenstein1910.jpg|thumb|In 1910, [[Edison Studios]] released the [[Frankenstein (1910 film)|first motion-picture adaptation]] of Shelley's story.]]

The Titan in the Greek mythology of Prometheus parallels Victor Frankenstein. Victor's work by creating man by new means reflects the same innovative work of the Titan in creating humans.

Some have argued that Mary Shelley saw Prometheus not as a hero but rather as something of a devil, and blamed him for bringing fire to man and thereby seducing the human race to the vice of eating meat (fire brought cooking which brought hunting and killing).&lt;ref&gt;(Leonard Wolf, p. 20).&lt;/ref&gt;

Byron was particularly attached to the play ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' by [[Aeschylus]], and Percy Shelley would soon write his own ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' (1820). The term "Modern Prometheus" was actually coined by [[Immanuel Kant]] in reference to [[Benjamin Franklin]] and his experiments with electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/exhibitions/2006/benjamin-franklin/ RoyalSoc.ac.uk] "Benjamin Franklin in London." The Royal Society. Retrieved 8 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shelley's sources==
Shelley incorporated a number of different sources into her work, one of which was the [[Prometheus|Promethean]] myth from [[Ovid]]. The influence of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', are also clearly evident within the novel. Mary is likely to have acquired some ideas for Frankenstein's character from [[Humphry Davy]]'s book ''Elements of Chemical Philosophy'', in which he had written that "science has ... bestowed upon man powers which may be called creative; which have enabled him to change and modify the beings around him ...". References to the [[French Revolution]] run through the novel; a possible source may lie in {{ill|François-Félix Nogaret|fr}}'s ''Le Miroir des événemens actuels, ou la Belle au plus offrant'' (1790): a political parable about scientific progress featuring an inventor named Frankésteïn who creates a life-sized automaton.&lt;ref&gt;Douthwaite, "The Frankenstein of the French Revolution" chapter 2 of The Frankenstein of 1790 and other Lost Chapters from Revolutionary France ([http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo13265096.html Frankenstein of 1790 and other Lost Chapters from Revolutionary France], 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Percy Bysshe Shelley's 1816 poem "[[Mutability (poem)|Mutability]]" is also quoted and its theme of the role of the subconscious is discussed in prose. The Creature also quotes a passage of the poem. His name has never appeared as the author of the poem although other poets are cited by name in the novel, implying that Mary wrote the poem and developed the psychological ideas. Another potential reason is to conceal his contributions to the novel.

Within the past thirty years or so, many writers and historians have attempted to associate several then popular natural philosophers (now called physical scientists) with Shelley's work on account of several notable similarities. Two of the most notable natural philosophers among Shelley's contemporaries were [[Giovanni Aldini]], who made many public attempts at human reanimation through bio-electric Galvanism in London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruston |first1=Sharon |title=The Science of Life and Death in Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein'' |journal=[[The Public Domain Review]] |date=25 November 2015 |url=http://publicdomainreview.org/2015/11/25/the-science-of-life-and-death-in-mary-shelleys-frankenstein/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johann Konrad Dippel]], who was supposed to have developed chemical means to extend the life span of humans. While Shelley was obviously aware of both these men and their activities, she makes no mention of or reference to them or their experiments in any of her published or released notes.

== Reception ==
[[File:Frontispiece to Frankenstein 1831.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration by [[Theodor von Holst]] from the frontispiece of the 1831 edition&lt;ref&gt;This illustration is reprinted in the frontispiece to the [https://www.amazon.com/dp/098092104X 2008 edition of ''Frankenstein'']&lt;/ref&gt;]]

''Frankenstein'' has been both well received and disregarded since its anonymous publication in 1818. Critical reviews of that time demonstrate these two views, along with confused speculation as to the identity of the author. The ''[[La Belle Assemblée|Belle Assemblée]]'' described the novel as "very bold fiction" (139). The ''Quarterly Review'' stated that "the author has the power of both conception and language" (185). [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], writing in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine|Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine]]'', congratulated "the author's original genius and happy power of expression" (620), although he is less convinced about the way in which the monster gains knowledge about the world and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crossref-it.info/textguide/Frankenstein/7/400 |title=Crossref-it.info |publisher=Crossref-it.info |date= |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Edinburgh Magazine'' and ''Literary Miscellany'' hoped to see "more productions from this author" (253). On the other hand, the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' described it "a tissue of horrible and disgusting absurdity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus''|journal=The Quarterly Review|date=January 1818|volume=18|pages=379–385|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044092624956;view=1up;seq=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two other reviews where the author is known as the daughter of William Godwin, the criticism of the novel makes reference to the feminine nature of Mary Shelley. The ''[[British Critic]]'' attacks the novel's flaws as the fault of the author: "The writer of it is, we understand, a female; this is an aggravation of that which is the prevailing fault of the novel; but if our authoress can forget the gentleness of her sex, it is no reason why we should; and we shall therefore dismiss the novel without further comment" (438). ''The Literary Panorama and National Register'' attacks the novel as a "feeble imitation of Mr. Godwin's novels" produced by the "daughter of a celebrated living novelist" (414). Despite the reviews, ''Frankenstein'' achieved an almost immediate popular success. It became widely known especially through melodramatic theatrical adaptations—Mary Shelley saw a production of ''Presumption; or The Fate of Frankenstein'', a play by [[Richard Brinsley Peake]], in 1823. A [[French translation]] appeared as early as 1821 (''Frankenstein: ou le Prométhée Moderne'', translated by Jules Saladin).

Critical reception of ''Frankenstein'' has been largely positive since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/nineteenth-century-criticism/frankenstein-modern-prometheus-mary-wollstonecraft |title=Enotes.com |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major critics such as M. A. Goldberg and [[Harold Bloom]] have praised the "aesthetic and moral" relevance of the novel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.octc.kctcs.edu/crunyon/CE/Frankenstein/Bloom/4-7_BloomIntro.htm |title=KCTCS.edu |publisher=Octc.kctcs.edu |date= |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are also critics such as [[Germaine Greer]], who criticized the novel as terrible due to technical and narrative defects (such as it featuring three narrators that speak in the same way).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/09/gender.books | title=Yes, Frankenstein really was written by Mary Shelley. It's obvious - because the book is so bad | work=The Guardian | author=Germaine Greer | date=2007-04-09 | accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent years the novel has become a popular subject for psychoanalytic and feminist criticism: Lawrence Lipking states: "[E]ven the [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] subgroup of psychoanalytic criticism, for instance, has produced at least half a dozen discrete readings of the novel".&lt;ref&gt;L. Lipking. Frankenstein the True Story; or [[Rousseau]] Judges Jean-Jacques. (Published in the [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|Norton]] critical edition. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; The novel today is generally considered to be a landmark work of romantic and gothic literature, as well as science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utm.edu/staff/lalexand/frankqst.htm UTM.edu] Lynn Alexander, Department of English, [[University of Tennessee]] at Martin. Retrieved 27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Film director [[Guillermo del Toro]] describes ''Frankenstein'' as "the quintessential teenage book", adding "You don't belong. You were brought to this world by people that don't care for you and you are thrown into a world of pain and suffering, and tears and hunger. It's an amazing book written by a teenage girl. It's mind-blowing."&lt;ref name="BBC 2018"/&gt; Professor of philosophy [[Patricia MacCormack]] says the creature, brought to life by Victor Frankenstein, addresses the most fundamental human questions: "It's the idea of asking your maker what your purpose is. Why are we here, what can we do?"&lt;ref name="BBC 2018"&gt;{{cite news|title=Frankenstein: Behind the monster smash|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42411484|agency=BBC|date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Georgian National Opera and Ballet Theater of Tbilisi''' ({{lang-ka|თბილისის ოპერისა და ბალეტის სახელმწიფო აკადემიური თეატრი}}), formerly known as the '''Tiflis Imperial Theater''', is an [[opera house]] situated on [[Rustaveli Avenue]] in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Founded in 1851, Tbilisi Opera is the main opera house of Georgia and one of the oldest such establishments in eastern [[Europe]].

Since 1896, the theater has resided in an exotic [[Moorish Revival architecture|neo-Moorish]] edifice originally constructed by [[Victor Schröter|Victor Johann Gottlieb Schröter]], a prominent architect of [[Baltic German]] origin. Although definitively [[Orientalism|Oriental]] in its decorations and style, the building's layout, foyers and the main hall are that of a typical [[Europe|European]] opera house. Since its foundation, the theater has been damaged by several fires and underwent major rehabilitation works under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Cabinet of Georgia (country)|Georgian]] leadership; the most recent restoration effort concluded in January 2016, having taken six years and costing approximately 40 million [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]], donated by a Georgian business foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew North. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/27/tibilisi-to-reopen-opera-house-that-has-survived-tsars-soviets-and-civil-war Tbilisi to reopen opera house that has survived tsars, Soviets and civil war], [[The Guardian]], 27 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera house is one of the centers of cultural life in Tbilisi and was once home to [[Zacharia Paliashvili]], the Georgian national composer whose name the institution has carried since 1937. The Opera and Ballet Theater also houses the [[State Ballet of Georgia]] under the leadership of internationally renowned Georgian ballerina [[Nina Ananiashvili]]. In recent years it has hosted opera stars such as [[Montserrat Caballé]] and [[José Carreras]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.primenewsonline.com/news/123/ARTICLE/17554/2007-12-14.html Montserrat Caballé To Give Concert At Opera Theater in Tbilisi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226091256/http://eng.primenewsonline.com/news/123/ARTICLE/17554/2007-12-14.html |date=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while also serving as a traditional venue for national celebrations and presidential inaugurations. 

==Origin and socio-political underpinnings==
The foundation of the Tiflis Imperial Opera was closely intertwined with the turbulent political processes in Georgia following the country's annexation by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1801. In the first half of the [[19th century]], Georgia remained a restless and poorly integrated part of the empire. Unhappy with Russian policies, in 1832 Georgian aristocracy hatched a plot against the local Russian authorities, which was discovered and resulted in multiple arrests and repressions in the subsequent years. Anxious to reconcile the Georgian opinion in view of these lingering difficulties, the new [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Viceroy of the Caucasus]], Count [[Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov|Mikhail Vorontsov]], implemented a number of cultural initiatives, one of which was the foundation of the opera. The declared purpose of its establishment was to benefit the "public well-being" but it also served an important political goal of fully integrating the local Georgian aristocracy into the Imperial social life, thereby distracting them from any further anti-Russian conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;Austin Jersild. ''Orientalism and Empire: North Caucasus Mountain Peoples and the Georgian Frontier'', 1845-1917, McGill-Queen's Press, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Rayfield]]. ''Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia.'' [[Reaktion Books]]; 2013, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Tiflis, The Imperial Theater, 1870s (A).jpg|thumb|left|Tiflis theater in the late 1800s]]

To satisfy Georgians, Vorontsov went on to patronize Georgian-language theater performances and did everything [[Saint Petersburg]] would permit to win over locals. These type of efforts were particularly relevant in light of the ongoing [[Caucasian War|Shamil's rebellion]] in the [[North Caucasus]], which prompted some Russians to see Georgian aristocrats as the only bulwark protecting Russia's southern imperial borders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Rayfield]]. ''The Literature of Georgia: A History.'' [[Routledge]], 2013; p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Vorontsov's conciliatory efforts were not without controversy, as not all Russians were enthusiastic about non-Russian contributions to the city's cultural development; some objected to Georgian-language productions and had them moved to different days, rather than precede regular opera performances as it was done up to that point.&lt;ref&gt;Michael David-Fox, Peter Holquist, Alexander Martin. Orientalism and Empire in Russia. Slavica: 2006, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Georgian National Opera Theater draft (1881).jpg|thumb|right|Tiflis theater draft made by [[Victor Schröter]].]]

At Vorontsov's initiative, the original theater site was chosen on [[Rustaveli Avenue]] in [[Freedom Square, Tbilisi|Erivan Square]], an area the administration correctly envisioned would be the center of the expanding city. The land was given free of charge from the governor of the [[Tiflis Governorate]], provided the theater would belong to the city.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgianpress.ru/tbilisi-week/our-past/10594-tbilisskaya-opera-istoriya-sozdaniya.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215102312/http://www.georgianpress.ru/tbilisi-week/our-past/10594-tbilisskaya-opera-istoriya-sozdaniya.html |archivedate=15 February 2013 |script-title=ru:Тбилисская опера - история создания|work=Tbilisi Week|author=Malkhaz Ebralidze |date=9 January 2013 |trans-title=Tbilisi Opera - History of its Creation |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundations of The Tiflis Imperial Theater were laid down on 15 April 1847. Italian architect [[Giovanni Scudieri]], who had come to Tiflis from [[Odessa]], was hired to oversee the project. The construction was completed in 1851.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;The interior of the theater was decorated by a Parisian designer, using colored velvet, gold and silver details, and expensive silks. A massive chandelier  weighing {{convert|1218|kg|lb}},  unassembled in 12 large boxes, was shipped by a steamer from Marseille to Kulevi on the Black Sea coast. Buffalo pulled the chandelier more than {{convert|300|km|mi}} to Tiflis.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; Russian painter [[Grigory Gagarin]] created the artwork for the theater. Vorontsov appointed writer [[Vladimir Sollogub]] as the theater's first director.

==Opening and the first performances==
[[File:Tbilisi Opera House in 12 april 1851 (A).jpg|thumb|right|Grand opening, 12 April 1851]]
On 12 April 1851, the theater held its grand opening, attended by the high society of Tiflis. As the theater stage was not yet complete, the theater instead held a masked ball and charity fundraiser for the [[Saint Nino]] Women's College.

Several months later the popular Parisian newspaper ''[[L'Illustration]]'' (issue 25 October 1851)  printed a large article by Edmond de Bares with two pictures of the interior of the theater. The author wrote, "This is the only theatre in the city, the interior of which is totally [[Moorish]] in style, and is doubtless one of the most elegant, beautiful and fascinating theatrical constructions, conceived by man."&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

In the spring of 1851, the theater director invited an Italian opera troupe, which had been touring the Russian Empire under the conductorship of [[Francisco Asenjo Barbieri]], to perform in Tiflis. The Italians traveled by carriage from [[Novocherkassk]], but became ill and exhausted as they made their way into the [[Caucasus Mountains]]. By the time they reached [[Stavropol]] in southern Russia, they had lost all patience and refused to continue to Tiflis. Finally they resumed, pausing often to rest as they traveled via the [[Georgian Military Highway]], before arriving in Tiflis on 9 October 1851.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

One month later, the first theatrical season officially opened in Tiflis with ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' by [[Gaetano Donizetti]]. After the spectacle, which had a great success, the hosts led Barbieri and the company to the left bank of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] for a public feast, where people celebrated on boats for the whole night. 

The Italians performed 12 different opera performances over the course of three months. As a consequence the orchestra was enriched with new instruments and [[Musical composition|musical scores]]. Foreign orchestra performers came to Tiflis and some settled there.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

==Fire and reconstruction==
[[File:Burned Tbilisi opera 1874.jpg|thumb|right|Theater following the devastating 1874 fire]]
On 11 October 1874, a fire began before a performance of  [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''. Though the fire brigade was across the street, the firefighters did not respond at first and did not bring ladders when they did, leading to outrage and accusations of the fire being intentional. The theater was completely destroyed, including the rich musical library, costumes, scenery, props and all of Gagarin's paintings.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Plans were made to rebuild the opera house. The theater decided to continue its season from the "Summer Theater", and returned 27 December with its production of ''Norma''. 

The city held a contest for a new architectural design. [[Viktor Schröter]], an architect of German origin from [[Saint Petersburg]], submitted the winning design. Construction of the new theater took years to get underway. There were repeated delays throughout the project, with the design not officially approved by Governor [[Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich]] until 1880. Even after the construction began, it would sometimes come to a complete halt.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The theater finally reopened in 1896.

==20th century==
[[File:Es Ra Katso?.jpg|thumb|Statue to [[George Balanchine]]]]

In 1937, the theater was renamed in honour of [[Zacharia Paliashvili]], one of Georgia's national composers. Unrest and destabilization in Georgia in the 1990s affected the Tbilisi opera theater, as it did many others in the country. The government could not provide sufficient resources for theater to function: this prevented the creation of new scenery or costumes, the recruitment of  artists, and maintenance of the already vulnerable building. Following the [[Rose Revolution]], however, the newly elected government improved the situation in opera as part of its cultural reforms.

[[File:Renaissance Grotesques Composition.jpg|thumb|right|Renaissance grotesque motifs in assorted formats.]]
[[File:Italia del nord, maschere con ornati, 1590-1610 ca..JPG|thumb|200px|Decorative panel showing the two separable elements of ''Grotesque'': the elaborate acanthus leaf and candelabra type design and the hideous mask or face]]
Since at least the 18th century (in French, German and English), '''grotesque''' (or '''grottoesque''') has come to be used as a general adjective for the strange, mysterious, magnificent, fantastic, hideous, ugly, incongruous, unpleasant, or disgusting, and thus is often used to describe weird shapes and distorted forms such as [[Halloween]] masks. In art, performance, and literature, however, ''grotesque'' may also refer to something that simultaneously invokes in an audience a feeling of uncomfortable bizarreness as well as [[sympathy|sympathetic]] [[pity]]. More specifically, the grotesque forms on [[Gothic architecture|Gothic buildings]], when not used as drain-spouts, should not be called [[gargoyle]]s, but rather referred to simply as grotesques, or [[Chimera (architecture)|chimeras]].&lt;ref&gt;Bridaham, Lester Burbank, introduction by Ralph Adams Cram, “Gargoyles, Chimeres and the Grotesque in French Gothic Sculpture”, Architectural Book Publishing Co., Inc. New York, 1930 p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was originally a noun (1560s), from Italian grottesco (through Middle French), literally "of a cave", from Italian ''grotta'' (see [[grotto]]),&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=grotesque |title=OED-Grotesque etymology |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; an extravagant style of [[Ancient Roman art|Ancient Roman]] decorative art rediscovered and then copied in Rome at the end of the 15th century. The word first was used of paintings found on the walls of basements of Roman ruins that were called at that time ''Le Grotte'' (The Grottoes) due to their appearance. These "caves" were in fact rooms and corridors of the [[Domus Aurea]], the unfinished palace complex started by [[Nero]] after the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in CE 64, which had become overgrown and buried, until they were broken into again, mostly from above. Spreading from Italian to the other European languages, the term was long used largely interchangeably with [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]] and [[moresque]] for types of decorative patterns using curving foliage elements.

Rémi Astruc has argued that although there is an immense variety of motifs and figures, the three main tropes of the grotesque are doubleness, [[hybridity]] and metamorphosis.&lt;ref&gt;Astruc R. (2010), Le Renouveau du grotesque dans le roman du XXe siècle, Paris, Classiques Garnier.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the current understanding of the grotesque as an aesthetic category, he demonstrated how the grotesque functions as a fundamental existential experience. Moreover, Astruc identifies the grotesque as a crucial, and potentially universal, anthropological device that societies have used to conceptualize alterity and change.{{Citation needed (lead)|date=July 2012}} &lt;!--tags removed: for citations in this summary, see main treatment below--&gt;

==History==
[[File:Domus fresco.jpg|thumb|Roman frescos in Nero's [[Domus Aurea]]]]
===Early examples in Roman ornaments===
In art, '''grotesques''' are ornamental arrangements of [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]]s with interlaced garlands and small and fantastic human and animal figures, usually set out in a [[symmetrical]] pattern around some form of architectural framework, though this may be very flimsy. Such designs were fashionable in ancient [[Rome]], as fresco wall decoration, floor mosaics, etc., and were decried by [[Vitruvius]] (c. 30 BC), who in dismissing them as meaningless and illogical, offered the description: "reeds are substituted for columns, fluted appendages with curly leaves and volutes take the place of pediments, candelabra support representations of shrines, and on top of their roofs grow slender stalks and volutes with human figures senselessly seated upon them."

When Nero's palace in Rome, the [[Domus Aurea]], was inadvertently rediscovered in the late 15th century, buried in fifteen hundred years of fill, the first breakthrough was from above, so that those keen to see the rooms had to be lowered down into them on ropes, completing their resemblance to caves, or [[grotto]]es in Italian.  The Roman wall decorations in fresco and delicate [[stucco]] were a revelation.

===Etymology in Renaissance===
[[File:Biblioteca Duomo Siena-2 Apr 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ceiling of the [[Piccolomini Library]]]]
The first appearance of the word ''grottesche'' appears in a contract of 1502 for the [[Piccolomini Library]] attached to the [[duomo]] of [[Siena]]. They were introduced by [[Raphael Sanzio]] and his team of decorative painters, who developed ''grottesche'' into a complete system of ornament in the [[Loggias]] that are part of the series of [[Raphael's Rooms]] in the [[Vatican Palace]], Rome. "The decorations astonished and charmed a generation of artists that was familiar with the grammar of the [[classical orders]] but had not guessed till then that in their private houses the Romans had often disregarded those rules and had adopted instead a more fanciful and informal style that was all lightness, elegance and grace."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward-Jackson, "The Grotesque" in "Some main streams and tributaries in European ornament from 1500 to 1750: part 1" ''The Victoria and Albert Museum Bulletin'' (June 1967, pp 58-70) p 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In these grotesque decorations a tablet or candelabrum might provide a focus; frames were extended into scrolls that formed part of the surrounding designs as a kind of scaffold, as Peter Ward-Jackson noted. Light scrolling grotesques could be ordered by confining them within the framing of a pilaster to give them more structure. [[Giovanni da Udine]] took up the theme of grotesques in decorating the [[Villa Madama]], the most influential of the new Roman villas.

In the 16th century, such artistic license and irrationality was controversial matter. [[Francisco de Holanda]] puts a defense in the mouth of [[Michelangelo]] in his third dialogue of ''Da Pintura Antiga'', 1548:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"this insatiable desire of man sometimes prefers to an ordinary building, with its pillars and doors, one falsely constructed in grotesque style, with pillars formed of children growing out of stalks of flowers, with [[architrave]]s and [[Cornice (architecture)|cornice]]s of branches of myrtle and doorways of reeds and other things, all seeming impossible and contrary to reason, yet it may be really great work if it is performed by a skillful artist."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in David Summers, "Michelangelo on Architecture", ''The Art Bulletin'' '''54'''.2 (June 1972:146-157) p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mannerism===
[[Image:Grotesqueengraving.jpg|thumb|250px|Grotesque engraving on paper, about 1500 - 1512, by [[Nicoletto da Modena]].]]
The delight of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] artists and their patrons in arcane iconographic programs available only to the erudite could be embodied in schemes of ''grottesche'',&lt;ref&gt;An example, the vaulted arcade in the Palazzo del Governatore, Assisi, which was frescoed with grotesques in 1556, has been examined in the monograph by Ezio Genovesi, ''Le grottesche della 'Volta Pinta' in Assisi'' (Assisi, 1995): Genovesi explores the role of the local Accademia del Monte.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Alciato]]'s ''[[Emblemata]]'' (1522) offered ready-made iconographic shorthand for vignettes. More familiar material for grotesques could be drawn from [[Metamorphoses|Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'']].&lt;ref&gt;Victor Kommerell, ''Metamorphosed Margins: The Case for a Visual Rhetoric of the Renaissance 'Grottesche' under the Influence of Ovid's Metamorphoses'' (Hildesheim, 2008)..&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vatican loggias]], a [[loggia]] corridor space in the [[Apostolic Palace]] open to the elements on one side, were decorated around 1519 by [[Raphael]]s's large team of artists, with [[Giovanni da Udine]] the main hand involved.  Because of the relative unimportance of the space, and a desire to copy the Domus Aurea style, no large paintings were used, and the surfaces were mostly covered with grotesque designs on a white background, with paintings imitating sculptures in niches, and small figurative subjects in a revival of Ancient Roman style. This large array provided a repertoire of elements that were the basis for later artists across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

In Michelangelo's [[Medici Chapel]] Giovanni da Udine composed during 1532-33 "most beautiful sprays of foliage, rosettes and other ornaments in stucco and gold" in the coffers and "sprays of foliage, birds, masks and figures", with a result that did not please [[Pope Clement VII|Pope Clement VII Medici]], however, nor [[Giorgio Vasari]], who whitewashed the grottesche decor in 1556.&lt;ref&gt;"''bellissimi fogliami, rosoni ed altri ornamenti di stuccho e d'oro''" and "''fogliami, uccelli, maschere e figure''", quoted by Summers 1972:151 and note 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Counter Reformation]] writers on the arts, notably Cardinal [[Gabriele Paleotti]], bishop of Bologna,&lt;ref&gt;Paleotti, ''Discorso intorno alle imagini sacre e profane'' (printed at Bologna, 1582)&lt;/ref&gt; turned upon ''grottesche'' with a righteous vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Summers 1972:152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasari, echoing Vitruvius, described the style as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Grotesques are a type of extremely licentious and absurd painting done by the ancients ... without any logic, so that a weight is attached to a thin thread which could not support it, a horse is given legs made of leaves, a man has crane's legs, with countless other impossible absurdities; and the bizarrer the painter's imagination, the higher he was rated".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vasari recorded that [[Francesco Bacchiacca|Francesco Ubertini, called "Bacchiacca"]], delighted in inventing ''grotteschi'', and (about 1545) painted for Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo de' Medici]] a ''[[studiolo]]'' in a mezzanine at the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] "full of animals and rare plants".&lt;ref&gt;"Dilettossi il Bacchiacca di far grottesche; onde al Sig. duca Cosimo fece uno studiolo pieno d'animali e d'erbe rare ritratte dalle naturali, che sono tenute bellissime": quoted in Francesco Vossilla, "Cosimo I, lo scrittoio del Bachiacca, una carcassa di capodoglio e la filosofia naturale", ''Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorischen Institutes in Florenz'', '''37.'''.2/3 (1993:381-395) p. 383; only fragments survive of the decor.&lt;/ref&gt; Other 16th-century writers on ''grottesche'' included [[Daniele Barbaro]], [[Pirro Ligorio]] and [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]].&lt;ref&gt;All mentioned by Ezio Genovesi 1995, in providing explanation of the genre in the context of the painted vaulting at Assisi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engravings, woodwork, book illustration, decorations===
In the meantime, through the medium of [[engraving]]s the grotesque mode of surface ornament passed into the European artistic repertory of the 16th century, from Spain to Poland. A classic suite was that attributed to [[Enea Vico]], published in 1540-41 under an evocative explanatory title, ''Leviores et extemporaneae picturae quas grotteschas vulgo vocant'', "Light and extemporaneous pictures that are vulgarly called grotesques". Later [[Mannerist]] versions, especially in engraving, tended to lose that initial lightness and be much more densely filled than the airy well-spaced style used by the Romans and Raphael.

Soon ''grottesche'' appeared in [[marquetry]] (fine woodwork), in [[maiolica]] produced above all at [[Urbino]] from the late 1520s, then in book illustration and in other decorative uses. At [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] [[Rosso Fiorentino]] and his team enriched the vocabulary of grotesques by combining them with the decorative form of [[strapwork]], the portrayal of leather straps in plaster or wood moldings, which forms an element in grotesques.
[[File:Boudoir.jpg|thumb|left|French [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] painted decor in the Raphaelesque ''grotesque'' manner at [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], 1780s]]

===From Baroque to Victorian era===
[[File:Groteskmask i guldtråd på schabrak, 1600-1650 - Skoklosters slott - 102320.tif|thumb|Grotesque made of gold thread on saddle pad, dated from 1600-1650.]]
In the 17th and 18th centuries the grotesque encompasses a wide field of [[teratology]] (science of monsters) and artistic experimentation. The monstrous, for instance, often occurs as the notion of ''play''. The sportiveness of the grotesque category can be seen in the notion of the preternatural category of the ''lusus naturae'', in natural history writings and in cabinets of curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mauries|first=Patrick|title=Cabinets of Curiosities|year=2002|publisher=Thames and Hudson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorraine Daston and Katharine Park|title=Wonders and the Order of Nature|year=1998|publisher=Zone Books|location=USA: New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last vestiges of romance, such as the marvellous also provide opportunities for the presentation of the grotesque in, for instance, operatic spectacle. The mixed form of the novel was commonly described as grotesque - see for instance Fielding's "comic epic poem in prose". (''Joseph Andrews'' and ''Tom Jones'')

Grotesque ornament received a further impetus from new discoveries of original Roman frescoes and stucchi at [[Pompeii]] and the other buried sites round [[Mount Vesuvius]] from the middle of the century. It continued in use, becoming increasingly heavy, in the [[Empire Style]] and then in the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] period, when designs often became as densely packed as in 16th-century engravings, and the elegance and fancy of the style tended to be lost.

==Extensions of the term in art==
Artists began to give the tiny faces of the figures in grotesque decorations strange [[caricature]]d expressions, in a direct continuation of the medieval traditions of the [[drolleries]] in the border decorations or initials in [[illuminated manuscript]]s. From this the term began to be applied to larger caricatures, such as those of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and the modern sense began to develop. It is first recorded in English in 1646 from Sir [[Thomas Browne]]:"In nature there are no grotesques".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Grotesque"&lt;/ref&gt; By extension backwards in time, the term became also used for the medieval originals, and in modern terminology medieval drolleries, half-human thumbnail vignettes drawn in the margins, and carved figures on buildings (that are not also waterspouts, and so [[gargoyle]]s) are also called "grotesques".

A boom in the production of works of art in the grotesque genre characterized the period 1920–1933 of [[German art]]. In contemporary illustration art, the "grotesque" figures, in the ordinary conversational sense, commonly appear in the genre ''grotesque art'', also known as [[fantastic art]].

==In literature==
One of the first uses of the term grotesque to denote a literary genre is in [[Essays (Montaigne)|Montaigne's ''Essays'']].&lt;ref&gt;Kayser (1957) I.2 ''Ce discours est bien grotesue''&lt;/ref&gt; The Grotesque is often linked with [[satire]] and [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p20"&gt;Clark (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LOeLRDzui_wC&amp;pg=PR20 pp. 20–1]&lt;/ref&gt; It is an effective artistic means to convey grief and pain to the audience, and for this has been labeled by [[Thomas Mann]] as the "genuine antibourgeois style".&lt;ref name="Clark91p20"/&gt;

Some of the earliest written texts describe grotesque happenings and monstrous creatures. The literature of Myth has been a rich source of monsters; from the one-eyed Cyclops (to cite one example) from Hesiod's ''Theogony'' to Homer's Polyphemus in the ''Odyssey''. Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' is another rich source for grotesque transformations and hybrid creatures of myth. Horace's ''Art of Poetry'' also provides a formal introduction classical values and to the dangers of grotesque or mixed form. Indeed, the departure from classical models of order, reason, harmony, balance and form opens up the risk of entry into grotesque worlds. Accordingly, British literature abounds with native grotesquerie, from the strange worlds of Spenser's allegory in ''The Faerie Queene'', to the tragi-comic modes of 16th-century drama. (Grotesque comic elements can be found in major works such as ''King Lear''.)

Literary works of ''mixed'' genre are occasionally termed grotesque, as are "low" or non-literary genres such as pantomime and farce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harham|first=Geoffrey Galt|title=On the Grotesque|year=1982|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gothic writings often have grotesque components in terms of character, style and location. In other cases, the environment described may be grotesque - whether urban ([[Charles Dickens]]), or the literature of the American south which has sometimes been termed "Southern Gothic". Sometimes the grotesque in literature has been explored in terms of social and cultural formations such as the carnival(-esque) in [[François Rabelais]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]. Terry Castle has written on the relationship between metamorphosis, literary writings and masquerade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castle|first=Terry|title=Masquerade and Civilization|year=1986|publisher=Methuen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major source of the grotesque is in satirical writings of the 18th century. [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' provides a variety of approaches to grotesque representation. In poetry, the works of [[Alexander Pope]] provide many examples of the grotesque.

In fiction, characters are usually considered '''grotesque''' if they induce both empathy and disgust. (A character who inspires disgust alone is simply a villain or a [[monster]].) Obvious examples would include the physically deformed and the mentally deficient, but people with cringe-worthy social traits are also included. The reader becomes piqued by the grotesque's positive side, and continues reading to see if the character can conquer their darker side. In Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]'', the figure of [[Caliban (character)|Caliban]] has inspired more nuanced reactions than simple scorn and disgust. Also, in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the character of Gollum may be considered to have both disgusting and empathetic qualities, which fit him into the grotesque template.

[[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' is one of the most celebrated grotesques in literature. Dr. Frankenstein's monster can also be considered a grotesque, as well as the title character, [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik]] in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and the Beast in [[Beauty and the Beast]]. Other instances of the romantic grotesque are also to be found in [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]], in ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' literature or in Sterne's ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''. The romantic grotesque is far more terrible and sombre than the medieval grotesque, which celebrated laughter and fertility. It is at this point that a grotesque creature such as Frankenstein's monster (in Mary Shelley's novel published in 1818) begins to be presented more sympathetically as the outsider who is the victim of society.&lt;ref&gt;See Jeanne M. Britton, 'Novelistic Sympathy in Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" ' ''Studies in Romanticism'' Vol. 48, No. 1 (Spring, 2009)3-22, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; But the novel also makes the issue of sympathy problematic in an unkind society. This means that society becomes the generator of the grotesque, by a process of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;Hanis McLaren Caldwell, ''Literature and Medicine in Nineteenth-Century Britain: from Mary Shelley to George Eliot'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the grotesque monster in ''Frankenstein'' tends to be described as 'the creature.'

The grotesque received a new shape with ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]], when a girl meets fantastic grotesque figures in her fantasy world. Carroll manages to make the figures seem less frightful and fit for [[children's literature]], but still utterly strange. Another comic grotesque writer who played on the relationship between sense and nonsense was [[Edward Lear]]. Humorous, or festive nonsense of this kind has its roots in the seventeenth century traditions of fustian, bombastic and satirical writing.&lt;ref&gt;See Noel Malcolm, ''The Origins of English Nonsense'' (Fontana, 1997). {{ISBN|0006388442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the nineteenth-century category of grotesque body was increasingly displaced by the notion of congenital deformity or medical anomaly.&lt;ref&gt;See George M. Gould and Walter M. Pyle's ''Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine'' (1896).&lt;/ref&gt; Building on this context, the grotesque begins to be understood more in terms as deformity and disability, especially after the First World War, 1914-18. In these terms, the art historian Leah Dickerman has argued that 'The sight of horrendously shattered bodies of veterans returned to the home front became commonplace. The accompanying growth in the prosthetic industry struck contemporaries as creating a race of half-mechanical men and became an important theme in dadaist work.'&lt;ref&gt;Leah Dickerman, ''Dada'', National Gallery of Art, Washington, 2005, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The poetry of [[Wilfred Owen]] displays a poetic and realistic sense of the grotesque horror of war and the human cost of brutal conflict. Poems such as 'Spring Offensive' and 'Greater Love' combined images of beauty with shocking brutality and violence in order to produce a sense of the grotesque clash of opposites. In a similar fashion, Ernst Friedrich (1894–1967), founder of the Berlin Peace Museum, an anarchist and a pacifist, was the author of ''War Against War'' (1924) which used grotesque photographs of mutilated victims of the First World War in order to campaign for peace.

[[Southern Gothic]] is a genre frequently identified with grotesques and [[William Faulkner]] is often cited as the ringmaster. [[Flannery O'Connor]] wrote, "Whenever I'm asked why Southern writers particularly have a penchant for writing about freaks, I say it is because we are still able to recognize one" ("Some Aspects of the Grotesque in Southern Fiction", 1960). In O'Connor's often-anthologized [[short-story]] "[[A Good Man is Hard to Find (short story)|A Good Man Is Hard to Find]]", the Misfit, a serial killer, is clearly a maimed soul, utterly callous to human life but driven to seek the truth. The less obvious grotesque is the polite, doting grandmother who is unaware of her own astonishing selfishness. Another oft-cited example of the grotesque from O'Connor's work is her short-story entitled "A Temple Of The Holy Ghost". The American novelist, [[Raymond Kennedy]] is another author associated with the literary tradition of the grotesque.

==Contemporary writers==

Contemporary writers of literary grotesque fiction include [[Ian McEwan]], [[Katherine Dunn]], [[Alasdair Gray]], [[Angela Carter]], [[Jeanette Winterson]], [[Umberto Eco]], [[Patrick McGrath (novelist)|Patrick McGrath]], [[Natsuo Kirino]], [[Paul G. Tremblay|Paul Tremblay]], [[Matt Bell (author)|Matt Bell]], [[Chuck Palahniuk]], [[Brian Evenson]], [[Caleb J. Ross]] (who writes domestic grotesque fiction),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calebjross.com/study/what-is-domestic-grotesque-fiction-and-why-do-i-write-it/ |title=What is Domestic Grotesque Fiction and Why Do I Write It? |publisher=Calebjross.com |date=2012-01-21 |accessdate=2013-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Thomas (author)|Richard Thomas]] and many authors who write in the [[bizarro fiction|bizarro genre of fiction]]. In 1929, G.L Van Roosbroeck wrote a book called "GROTESQUES" (illustrations by J. Matulka) published by The Williamsport Printing and Binding Co., Williamsport, PA. It is a collection of 6 stories and 3 fables for the children of tomorrow.

== Pop culture ==
Other contemporary writers who have explored the grotesque in pop-culture are [https://books.google.com/books?id=n8cmPNEJk98C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=grotesque+pop+culture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5qMTd7pDMAhXKbz4KHeZbDZIQ6AEIHzAB John Docker], in the context of postmodernism; [https://books.google.com/books?id=wgTYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=grotesque+pop+culture&amp;dq=grotesque+pop+culture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5qMTd7pDMAhXKbz4KHeZbDZIQ6AEILzAE Cintra Wilson], who analyzes celebrity; and [https://www.amazon.com/The-Infantile-Grotesque-Pathology-Sexuality/dp/1934542490 Francis Sanzaro], who discusses its relation to childbirth and obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;Sanzaro, Francis. The Infantile Grotesque: Pathology, Sexuality, and a Theory of Religion. Davies Group Publishers, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre of the Grotesque==
The term '''[[Theatre of the Grotesque]]''' refers to an anti-[[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] school of Italian dramatists, writing in the 1910s and 1920s, who are often seen as precursors of the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].
Characterized by ironic and macabre themes of daily life in the world war 1 era. Theatre of the grotesque was named after the play 'The Mask and the Face' by Luigi Chiarelli, which was described as ' a grotesque in three acts'.

[[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]] is a major author of contemporary grotesque comedy plays.

==In architecture==
{{seemain|chimera (architecture)}}
[[File:Greyfriars grotesques.JPG|thumb|Detail from the [[John Mylne (1611–1667)|John Mylne Monument]] in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]]. The text reads ...''Aetatis Suae 56'' because he died at age 56]]
In architecture the term "grotesque" means a carved stone figure.

Grotesques are often confused with [[gargoyle]]s, but the distinction is that gargoyles are figures that contain a water spout through the mouth, while grotesques do not. Without a water spout, this type of sculpture is also known as a chimera when it depicts fantastical creatures. In the Middle Ages, the term ''babewyn'' was used to refer to both gargoyles and grotesques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Janetta Rebold Benton|authorlink=|title=Holy Terrors: Gargoyles on Medieval Buildings|edition=|publisher=Abbeville Press|year=1997|location=New York|pages=8–10|url=|isbn=0-7892-0182-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''babbuino'', which means "[[baboon]]".

==In typography==
{{main|Grotesque (typeface classification)}}
The word "Grotesque", or "Grotesk" in German, is also frequently used as a synonym for [[sans-serif]] in [[typography]]. At other times, it is used (along with "Neo-Grotesque", "Humanist", "[[Lineal typeface#Lineal|Lineal]]", and "Geometric") to describe a particular style or subset of sans-serif typefaces. The origin of this association can be traced back to English typefounder [[William Thorowgood]], who first introduced the term "grotesque" and in 1835 produced ''7-line pica grotesque''—the first sans-serif typeface containing actual lowercase letters. An alternate etymology is possibly based on the original reaction of other typographers to such a strikingly featureless typeface.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite web|url=http://typenstuff.com/help/4_22%20status%20books.pdf |title=Linéale Grotesques |publisher=Rabbit Moon Press |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102201041/http://typenstuff.com/help/4_22%20status%20books.pdf |archivedate=January 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular Grotesque typefaces include [[Franklin Gothic]], [[News Gothic]], [[Haettenschweiler]] and [[Lucida Sans]] (although the latter lacks the [[G#Typographic forms|spurred]] "G"), whereas popular Neo-Grotesque typefaces include [[Arial]], [[Helvetica]] and [[Verdana]].

The '''Hanoi Opera House''', or the '''Grand Opera House''' ({{lang-vi|Nhà hát lớn Hà Nội}}, {{lang-fr|Opéra de Hanoï}}) is an [[opera house]] in central [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]]. It was erected by the French colonial administration between 1901 and 1911. 

==Building==
{{double image|1=right|2=Hanoi Theatre.JPG|3=250|4=Palais Garnier.jpg|5=200|6=Hanoi Opera House, taken in the early 20th century, from rue [[Paul Bert]] (now [[Trang Tien]] street)|7=[[Palais Garnier|Opéra Garnier de Paris]], the model for the Hanoi Opera House|8=Hanoi Opera House|9=Opéra Garnier de Paris}}

It was modeled on the [[Palais Garnier]], the older of [[Paris]]'s two opera houses, and is considered to be one of the architectural landmarks of Hanoi. After the departure of the French the opera house became the scene for several political events.&lt;ref&gt;War in the Shadows: The Guerrilla in History: Volume 1 - Page 403 Robert B. Asprey - 2002 "In early September, Viet Minh leaders (accompanied by OSS officers) stood on the balcony of the Hanoi opera house to proclaim the new Democratic Republic of Vietnam (the DRV)."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the scene of street fighting during the fight for Hanoi.

The Hanoi Opera House provides the names for the neighboring [[Hilton Hanoi Opera Hotel]] which opened in 1999, as well as for the MGallery Hotel de l'Opera Hanoi, which opened in 2011.  For historical reasons associated with the [[Vietnam war]], the Hilton Hanoi Opera Hotel was not named the [[Hanoi Hilton]].

==The Opera Company==
===Colonial period===
The opera house is described in the memoirs of [[Blanche Arral]] who performed in the new Hanoi Opera House in 1902 while waiting for the 1902 [[Hanoi exhibition|Exposition of Hanoi]] to open.&lt;ref&gt;Arral, pp.??:  "Like so many theaters in remote places, it was a small-scale model of the Paris Opera, new and with all the latest equipment for theatrical productions. It was our plan to give performances in Haiphong until such time as the International Exposition at Hanoi opened, and then to alternate between the two cities."&lt;/ref&gt; The opera had depended on touring artists performing French and Italian repertoire during the colonial period for a mainly French audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanoioperahouse.org.vn/E_FontEnd/E_Lichsu.aspx History]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Vietnam National Opera and Ballet (VNOB)===
After the departure of the French the building was used for Vietnamese plays and musicals. The return of Western opera, and the first major non-French or Italian opera, was a performance of [[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin'']] organised under Vietnam-Soviet cultural auspices in 1960, where the Russian vocal coach selected an untrained singer [[Quý Dương]] as a fit for the [[baritone]] title role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baomoi.com/Nghe-sy-Quy-Duong-Tinh-ca-dai-theo-dat-nuoc/71/6546611.epi Nghệ sỹ Quý Dương: Tình ca dài theo đất nước]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the orchestra of the opera overlaps with the [[Vietnam National Symphony Orchestra]], and calls on the [[Hanoi Philharmonic Orchestra]] of the [[Hanoi Conservatory]]. Famous singers of the company include the [[Tchaikovsky Conservatory]]-trained soprano [[Lê Dung]], the youngest ever person to be awarded [[People's Artist]] of Vietnam in 1993.

The Opera has seen many premieres of operas and musicals by Vietnamese composers. The operas of [[Đỗ Nhuận]] - ''[[Cô Sao]]'' ('Miss Sao') 1965, ''Người tạc tượng'' ('The Sculptor') 1971 and ''Nguyễn Trãi'' 1980, the works of [[Lưu Hữu Phước]] and the choral works of film composer [[Đặng Hữu Phúc]]. As well as works by returning emigre composers such as [[Nguyen-Thien Dao|Nguyễn Thiên Đạo]], a pupil of [[Messiaen]] in Paris.

The National Ballet is also part of the Opera House company - and stages Western classics such as [[Swan Lake]] as well as traditional and modern Vietnamese dance productions.

'''Haukur Halldórsson''' (The Hawk) (born 1937 in Reykjavík) is an [[Iceland]]ic artist and member of the [[Íslenska Ásatrúarfélagið]].

His first exhibition was in Gallery Djupið in [[Reykjavík]] in 1978 with [[Einar Þorsteinn Ásgeirsson]], His first solo exhibition was in [[Reykjavík]] in 1980 in Gallery Torg run by the composer [[Jóhann G. Jóhannson]]. Since then he has made numerous exhipbitons in Europe, China and in the USA. He works in various media, painting, sculpture, jewel making and explores most any media.

== Themes ==

Halldorsson explored for a long time the theme of folklore of his  home country Iceland, the [[Brothers Grimm]], [[Celtic mythology]] and [[Nordic mythology]] in his art practice. He has made numerous drawings an illustrations on the subjects. Halldórsson has traveled widely to examine art, to [[China]], various countries in [[Europe]], and the [[United States]]. In [[New Mexico]] he encountered  the [[Navajo people|Navajo Indians]], and observed the art of sand-casting which he later applied in his own art practice.

His current practice evolves around the North-European mythology and Nordic mythology.
His website presents his version of the Viking myth of [[Asgard]], [[Yggdrasil|Yggdrasil, The Tree of Live]] and the bewitching underworld.

His selection of works from 1989 until 2001 combines disparate elements from the worlds of fantasy, myth and everyday experience.
His paintings often contain mysterious magical characters, fire-spewing primeval titans, sections of peculiar structures, living skulls, Viking ships in strange surroundings etc. &lt;!-- Other works present rearing horses or reclining nudes obviously based on classical models removed to an anomalous environments.

'''Ion Creangă''' ({{IPA-ro|iˈon ˈkre̯aŋɡə}}; also known as '''Nică al lui Ștefan a Petrei''', '''Ion Torcălău''' and '''Ioan Ștefănescu'''; March 1, 1837 – December 31, 1889) was a [[Romania]]n writer, raconteur and schoolteacher. A main figure in 19th century [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], he is best known for his ''[[Childhood Memories (Creangă)|Childhood Memories]]'' volume, his [[novella]]s and [[Short story|short stories]], and his many [[anecdote]]s. Creangă's main contribution to [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] and [[children's literature]] includes narratives structured around eponymous protagonists ("[[Harap Alb]]", "[[Ivan Turbincă]]", "[[Dănilă Prepeleac]]", "[[Stan Pățitul]]"), as well as [[fairy tale]]s indebted to conventional forms ("[[The Story of the Pig]]", "[[The Goat and Her Three Kids]]", "[[The Mother with Three Daughters-in-Law]]", "[[The Old Man's Daughter and the Old Woman's Daughter]]"). Widely seen as masterpieces of the [[Romanian language]] and [[Romanian humor|local humor]], his writings occupy the middle ground between a collection of [[Folklore of Romania|folkloric sources]] and an original contribution to a [[literary realism]] of rural inspiration. They are accompanied by a set of contributions to [[erotic literature]], collectively known as his "corrosives".

A [[Defrocking|defrocked]] [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] priest with an unconventional lifestyle, Creangă made an early impact as an innovative educator and textbook author, while pursuing a short career in [[Romanian nationalism|nationalist]] politics with the [[Free and Independent Faction]]. His literary debut came late in life, closely following the start of his close friendship with Romania's [[national poet]] [[Mihai Eminescu]] and their common affiliation with the influential [[Conservatism|conservative]] literary society ''[[Junimea]]''. Although viewed with reserve by many of his colleagues there, and primarily appreciated for his records of [[oral tradition]], Creangă helped propagate the group's cultural guidelines in an accessible form. Later critics have often described him, alongside Eminescu, [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and [[Ioan Slavici]], as one of the most accomplished representatives of ''Junimist'' literature.

Ion Creangă was posthumously granted several honors, and is commemorated by a number of institutions in both Romania and neighboring [[Moldova]]. These include the ''[[Ion Creangă Memorial House, Iași|Bojdeuca]]'' building in [[Iași]], which, in 1918, was opened as the first memorial house in Romania. His direct descendants include [[Horia Creangă]], one of the leading Romanian architects during the [[interwar period]].

==Biography==

===Background and family===
Ion Creangă was born in Humulești in the [[Principality of Moldavia]], a former village which has since been incorporated into [[Târgu Neamț]] city, the son of Orthodox trader Ștefan sin Petre Ciubotariul and his wife Smaranda.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;477; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;206–207&lt;/ref&gt; His native area, bordering on heavily forested areas,&lt;ref name="gc477"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;477&lt;/ref&gt; was in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Eastern Carpathian]] foothills, and included into what was then the principality of Moldavia. The surrounding region's population preserved an archaic way of life, dominated by [[shepherd]]ing, textile manufacturing and related occupations,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;477, 488; Djuvara, p.&amp;nbsp;226–227, 244&lt;/ref&gt; and noted for preserving the older forms of [[Folklore of Romania|local folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;477, 517, 974–975&lt;/ref&gt; Another characteristic of the area, which left an impression on Creangă's family history, was related to the practice of [[transhumance]] and the links between [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] communities on both sides of the mountains, in Moldavia and [[Transylvania]]: on his maternal side, the writer descended from [[Maramureș]]-born peasants,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;477. See also Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;206&lt;/ref&gt; while, according to literary historian [[George Călinescu]], his father's origin may have been further southwest, in Transylvania-proper.&lt;ref name="gc477"/&gt;

The family had reached a significant position within their community: Ștefan sin Petre had made a steady income from his itinerant trade in wool, while his wife was the descendant of the Creangăs of [[Pipirig]], a family of community leaders. The latter's members included [[Metropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina|Moldavian Metropolitan]] [[Iacob Stamati]], as well as Smaranda's father, ''[[Vornic]]'' David, and her uncle Ciubuc Clopotarul, a monk at [[Neamț Monastery]].&lt;ref name="gc477, 478"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;477, 478&lt;/ref&gt; Proud of this tradition, it was her who insisted for her son to pursue a career in the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;477, 478; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;206–207&lt;/ref&gt; According to his own recollection, the future writer was born on March 1, 1837—a date which has since been challenged.&lt;ref name="gc477, 478"/&gt; Creangă's other statements mention March 2, 1837, or an unknown date in 1836.&lt;ref name="gc478"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;478&lt;/ref&gt; The exactitude of other accounts is equally unreliable: community registers from the period gave the date of June 10, 1839, and mention another child of the same name being born to his parents on February 4, 1842 (the more probable birth date of Creangă's younger brother Zahei).&lt;ref name="gc478"/&gt; The imprecision also touches other aspects of his family life: noting the resulting conflicts in data, Călinescu decided that it was not possible for one to know if the writer's parents were married to each other (and, if so, if they were on their first marriage), nor how many children they had together.&lt;ref name="gc478"/&gt; At a time when family names were not legally required, and people were primarily known by various nicknames and [[patronymic]]s, the boy was known to the community as ''Nică'', a [[hypocorism]] formed from ''Ion'', or more formally as ''Nică al lui Ștefan a Petrei'' ("Nică of Ștefan of Petru", occasionally ''Nic-a lui Ștefan a Petrei'').&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;477; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;206&lt;/ref&gt;

After an idyllic period, which is recounted in the first section of his ''[[Childhood Memories (Creangă)|Childhood Memories]]'', Ion Creangă was sent to primary school, an institution then in the care of Orthodox Church authorities, where he became noted for his rebellious attitude and appetite for [[truancy]].&lt;ref name="gc477"/&gt; Among his colleagues was a female student, Smărăndița popii (known later as Smaranda Posea), for whom he developed an affection which lasted into his adult life, over decades in which the two no longer saw each other.&lt;ref name="lmmonogr"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Luminița Marcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/o_monografie_spectaculoas "O monografie spectaculoasă"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102185822/http://www.romlit.ro/o_monografie_spectaculoas |date=2010-11-02 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 21/2000&lt;/ref&gt; He was taught reading and writing in [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic alphabet]] through [[peer tutor]]ing techniques, before the overseeing teacher, {{Not a typo|Vasile a Ilioaiei}}, was [[lasso]]ed off the street and conscripted by the [[Moldavian military forces|Moldavian military]] at some point before 1848.&lt;ref name="gc477"/&gt; After another teacher, whom the ''Memories'' portray as a drunk, died from [[cholera]] in late 1848, David Creangă withdrew his grandson from the local school and took him to a similar establishment in [[Broșteni, Suceava|Broșteni]], handing him into the care of a middle-aged woman, Irinuca.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;477, 479&lt;/ref&gt; Ion Creangă spent several months at Irinuca's remote house on the [[Bistrița River (Siret)|Bistrița River]], before the proximity of goats resulted in a [[scabies]] infection and his hastened departure for Pipirig, where he cured himself using [[birch]] extract, a [[folk remedy]] mastered by his maternal grandmother Nastasia.&lt;ref name="gc477"/&gt;

After returning to school between late 1849 and early 1850, Creangă was pulled out by his financially struggling father, spent the following period working in [[Spinning (textiles)|wool-spinning]], and became known by the occupational nickname ''Torcălău'' ("Spinster").&lt;ref name="gc477"/&gt; He only returned in third grade some four years later, having been sent to the Târgu Neamț public school, newly founded by [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavian Prince]] [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]] as part of the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' string of reforms.&lt;ref name="gc477"/&gt; A colleague of future philosopher [[Vasile Conta]] in the class of priest and theologian [[Isaia Teodorescu|Isaia "Popa Duhu" Teodorescu]], Creangă was sent to the [[Fălticeni]] [[seminary]] in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;477; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;207&lt;/ref&gt; After having been registered as ''Ioan Ștefănescu'' (a variant of his given name and a family name based on his patronymic), the adolescent student eventually adopted his maternal surname of ''Creangă''.&lt;ref name="gc477, 478"/&gt; According to Călinescu, this was done either "for aesthetic reasons" (as his new name, literally meaning "branch" or "bough", "sounds good") or because of a likely discovery that Ștefan was not his real father.&lt;ref name="gc477, 478"/&gt; Dan Grădinaru, a researcher of Creangă's work, believes that the writer had a special preference for the variant ''Ioan'', generally used in more learned circles, instead of the variant ''Ion'' that was consecrated by his biographers.&lt;ref name="lmmonogr"/&gt;

Having witnessed, according to his own claim, the indifference and mundane preoccupations of his peers, Creangă admitted to having taken little care in his training, submitting to the [[drinking culture]], playing [[practical joke]]s on his colleagues, and even [[shoplifting]], while pursuing an affair with the daughter of a local priest.&lt;ref name="gc478"/&gt; According to his own statement, he was a philanderer who, early in his youth, had already "caught the scent" of the ''catrință'' (the skirt in [[Romanian dress|traditional costumes]]).&lt;ref name="gudecemb"&gt;{{ro icon}} Gabriela Ursachi, [http://www.romlit.ro/decembrie2 "Decembrie"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 50/2004&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1855, circumstances again forced him to change schools: confronted with the closure of his Fălticeni school,&lt;ref name="gc478"/&gt; Creangă left for the Central Seminary attached to [[Socola Monastery]], in Moldavia's capital of [[Iași]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;478; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;207&lt;/ref&gt; Ștefan sin Petre's 1858 death left him without means of support, and he requested being directly [[Ordination|ordained]], but, not being of the necessary age, was instead handed a certificate to attest his school attendance.&lt;ref name="gc478"/&gt; He was soon after married, after a brief courtship, to the 15-year-old Ileana, daughter of Priest Ioan Grigoriu from the [[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Iași|church of the Forty Saints]], where he is believed to have been in training as a schoolteacher.&lt;ref name="gc478"/&gt; The ceremony took place in August 1859,&lt;ref name="gc478"/&gt; several months after the [[United Principalities|personal union]] between Moldavia and its southern neighbor [[Wallachia]], effected by the election of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] as ''[[Domnitor]]''. Having been employed as a [[Cantor (church)|cantor]] by his father in law's church, he was ordained in December of the same year, assigned to the position of [[deacon]] in Holy Trinity Church, and, in May 1860, returned to Forty Saints.&lt;ref name="gc478"/&gt;

Relations between Creangă and Grigoriu were exceptionally tense. Only weeks after his wedding, the groom, who had probably agreed to marriage only because it could facilitate succeeding Grigoriu,&lt;ref name="zononcon"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/index.php?nr=206&amp;cmd=articol&amp;id=7507 "Nonconformisme celebre (1997)"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Vol. V, Nr. 26, January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; signed a complaint addressed to Metropolitan [[Sofronie Miclescu]], denouncing his father in law as "a killer", claiming to have been mistreated by him and cheated out of his wife's [[dowry]], and demanding to be allowed a divorce.&lt;ref name="gc478"/&gt; The response to this request was contrary to his wishes: he was ordered into isolation by the ''Dicasterie'', the supreme [[ecclesiastical court]], being allowed to go free only on promise to reconcile with Grigoriu.&lt;ref name="gc478"/&gt;

===Beginnings as schoolteacher and clash with the Orthodox Church===
[[File:Ion Creanga - Foto04.jpg|thumb|200px|Ion Creangă as a deacon]]
In 1860, Creangă enlisted at the Faculty of Theology, part of the newly founded [[University of Iași]],&lt;ref name="gc478"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt; and, in December 1860, fathered a son, Constantin.&lt;ref name="gc478"/&gt; His life still lacked in stability, and he decided to move out of Grigoriu's supervision and into [[Bărboi Church]], before his position as deacon was cut out of the budget and his belongings were evicted out of his temporary lodging in 1864.&lt;ref name="gc478"/&gt; He contemplated leaving the city, and even officially requested a new assignment in the more remote [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Bolgrad]].&lt;ref name="gc478"/&gt; Since January 1864, when the Faculty of Theology had been closed down,&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt; he had been attending Iași's [[Trei Ierarhi Monastery]] [[normal school]] (''Trisfetite'' or ''Trei Sfetite''), where he first met the young cultural figure [[Titu Maiorescu]], who served as his teacher and supervisor, and whence he graduated as the first in his class (June 1865).&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;479; Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;233–234, 235. See also Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;32, 207&lt;/ref&gt; Embittered by his own experience with the [[Education in Romania|education system]], Creangă became an enthusiastic promoter of Maiorescu's ideas on [[education reform]] and [[modernization]], and in particular of the new methods of teaching reading and writing.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;233–236&lt;/ref&gt; During and after completing normal school, he was assigned to teaching positions at Trisfetite.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;479; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;207&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he earned the reputation of a demanding teacher (notably by accompanying his reports on individual students with characterizations such as "idiot", "impertinent" or "envious").&lt;ref name="gc479"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;479&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts from the period state that he made use of [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] in disciplining his pupils, and even surpassed the standards of violence accepted at the time.&lt;ref name="lmmonogr"/&gt;

In parallel, he was beginning his activities in support of education reform. By 1864, he and several others, among them schoolteacher V. Răceanu,&lt;ref name="tvii208"&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt; were working on a new [[primer (textbook)|primer]], which saw print in 1868 under the title ''Metodă nouă de scriere și cetire pentru uzul clasei I primară'' ("A New Method of Writing and Reading for the Use of 1st Grade Primary Course Students"). It mainly addressed the issues posed by the new [[Romanian alphabet]]ical standard, a [[Romanization]] replacing [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic spelling]] (which had been officially discarded in 1862).&lt;ref name="apspatiul"&gt;{{ro icon}} Adrian Pârvu, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/stire-jurnalul-casei-mele/spatiul-viral-al-geniului-o-camera-si-un-ceardac-31123.html "Spațiul viral al geniului: o cameră și un ceardac"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', December 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Largely based on Maiorescu's principles, ''Metodă nouă&amp;nbsp;...'' became one the period's most circulated textbooks.&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zo233-234"&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;233–234&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[Didacticism|didactic]] texts, it also featured Creangă's isolated debut in [[lyric poetry]], with a naïve piece titled ''Păsărica în timpul iernii'' ("The Little Bird in Wintertime").&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt; The book was followed in 1871 by another such work, published as ''Învățătoriul copiilor'' ("The Children's Teacher") and co-authored by V. Răceanu.&lt;ref name="zo234; tvii208"&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;234; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt; It included several prose [[fable]]s and a [[sketch story]], "Human Stupidity",&lt;ref name="tvii208"/&gt; to which later editions added ''Poveste'' ("A Story") and ''Pâcală'' (a borrowing of the fictional folk character better known as ''[[Păcală]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;205–206, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1866, having briefly served at Iași's Pantelimon Church, he was welcomed by ''[[hegumen]]'' Isaia Vicol Dioclias into the service of [[Golia Monastery]].&lt;ref name="gc478"/&gt; Around 1867, his wife Ileana left him. After that moment, Creangă began losing interest in performing his duties in the clergy, and, while doing his best to hide that he was no longer living with his wife, took a mistress.&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt; The marriage's breakup was later attributed by Creangă himself to Ileana's [[Adultery|adulterous]] affair with a Golia monk,&lt;ref name="gc478-479"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;478–479&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ccpreotia"&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Coroiu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/COROIUdec7.html "Preoția lui Creangă"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and rumors spread that Ileana's lover was a high-ranking official, the [[protopope]] of Iași.&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt; Creangă's accusations, Călinescu contends, are nevertheless dubious, because the deacon persisted in working for the same monastery after the alleged incident.&lt;ref name="gc478-479"/&gt;

By the second half of the 1860s, the future writer was also pursuing an interest in politics, which eventually led him to rally with the more [[Romanian nationalism|nationalist]] group within the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Romanian liberal current]], known as [[Free and Independent Faction]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;231, 234; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="csmarturii"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cornelia Ștefănescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/mrturii_despre_ion_creang "Mărturii despre Ion Creangă"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 15/2003&lt;/ref&gt; An agitator for his party, Creangă became commonly known under the nickname ''Popa Smântână'' ("Priest Sour Cream").&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc435; zo231; tvii207"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;435; Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;231; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;207&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1866, shortly after ''Domnitor'' Cuza was toppled by a coup, and just before [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] was selected to replace him, the [[Romanian Army]] intervened to quell a separatist riot in Iași, instigated by [[Metropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina|Moldavian Metropolitan]] [[Calinic Miclescu]]. It is likely that Creangă shared the outlook of other Factionalists, according to which secession was preferable to Carol's rule, and was probably among the rioters.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;207&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time, he began circulating antisemitic tracts, and is said to have demanded that Christians [[boycott]] Jewish business.&lt;ref name="lmmonogr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ao140"&gt;Oișteanu, p.&amp;nbsp;140&lt;/ref&gt; He is thought to have coined the expression ''Nici un ac de la jidani'' ("Not even a needle from the [[kike]]s").&lt;ref name="lmmonogr"/&gt; He was eventually selected as one of the Factionalist candidates for an Iași seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Romanian Deputies' Chamber]], as documented by the memoirs of his conservative rival, [[Iacob Negruzzi]].&lt;ref name="zo231"&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;231&lt;/ref&gt; The episode is supposed to have taken place at the earliest during the [[Romanian general election, 1871|1871 suffrage]].&lt;ref name="zo231"/&gt;

By 1868, Creangă's rebellious stance was irritating his hierarchical superiors, and, according to Călinescu, his consecutive actions show that he was "going out of his way for scandal".&lt;ref name="gc479"/&gt; He was initially punished for attending a [[Iași National Theatre|Iași Theater]] performance, as well as for defiantly claiming that there was "nothing scandalous or demoralizing" in what he had seen,&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc479"/&gt; and reportedly further antagonized the monks by firing a gun to scare off the rooks nesting on his church.&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ccpreotia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;479; Vianu, Vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;302; Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt; The latter incident, which some commentators believe fabricated by Creangă's detractors,&lt;ref name="ccpreotia"/&gt; was judged absurd by the ecclesiastical authorities, who had been further alarmed by negative reporting in the press.&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc479"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt; When told that no clergyman other than him had been seen using a gun, Creangă issued a reply deemed "[[Nasreddin]]esque" by George Călinescu, maintaining that, unlike others, he was not afraid of doing so.&lt;ref name="gc479"/&gt; Confronted by Metropolitan Calinic himself, Creangă allegedly argued that he could think of no other way to eliminate rooks, being eventually pardoned by the prelate when it was ruled that he had not infringed on [[canon law]].&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt;

===Defrocking and the ''Bojdeuca'' years===
[[File:RO IS bojdeuca lui ion creanga.jpeg|thumb|280px|Creangă's ''[[Ion Creangă Memorial House, Iași|Bojdeuca]]'' in [[Iași]]]]
Creangă eventually moved out of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church basement,&lt;ref name="gc479"/&gt; and, in what was probably a [[Modernization|modernizing]] intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest.&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ccpreotia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc479; tvii208"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;479; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt; The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long.&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc479"/&gt; After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience.&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc479"/&gt; He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity), Creangă considered himself [[Defrocking|defrocked]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;479. See also Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;208–209&lt;/ref&gt; He relinquished his [[clerical clothing]] altogether and began wearing [[Laity|lay]] clothes everywhere, a matter which caused public outrage.&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt;

By then a teacher at the 1st School for Boys, on Română Street, Creangă was ordered out of his secular assignment in July 1872, when news of his status and attitude reached [[Ministry of Education, Research and Innovation (Romania)|Education Minister]] [[Christian Tell]].&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ccpreotia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc479; tvii208"/&gt; Upset by the circumstances, and objecting in writing on grounds that it did not refer to his teaching abilities,&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ccpreotia"/&gt; he fell back on income produced by a [[tobacconist]]'s shop he had established shortly before being dismissed.&lt;ref name="ccpreotia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc479; tvii208"/&gt; This stage marked a final development in Creangă's conflict with the church hierarchy. Summoned to explain why he was living the life of a shopkeeper, he responded in writing by showing his unwillingness to apologize, and indicated that he would only agree to face secular courts.&lt;ref name="tvii209"&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;209&lt;/ref&gt; The virulent text notably accused the church officials of being his enemies on account of his "independence, sincerity, honesty" in supporting the cause of "human dignity".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;302; Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;209&lt;/ref&gt; After the gesture of defiance, the court recommended his defrocking, its decision being soon after confirmed by the [[synod]].&lt;ref name="ccpreotia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tvii209"/&gt;

In the meantime, Creangă moved into what he called ''[[Ion Creangă Memorial House, Iași|Bojdeuca]]'' (or ''Bujdeuca'', both being [[Moldavian subdialect of Romanian|Moldavian regional speech]] for "tiny hut"), a small house located on the outskirts of Iași. Officially divorced in 1873,&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc479; tvii209"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;479; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;209&lt;/ref&gt; he was living there with his lover Ecaterina "Tinca" Vartic.&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc479; tvii209"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mlrdacia"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.dacialiterara.ro/MLR.htm "Muzeul Literaturii Române Iași"], hosted by ''[[Dacia Literară]]''; retrieved August 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A former [[laundress]] who had earlier leased one of the ''Bojdeuca'' rooms,&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt; she shared Creangă's peasant-like existence. This lifestyle implied a number of eccentricities, such as the former deacon's practice of wearing loose shirts throughout summer and bathing in a natural pond.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;479; Vianu, Vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;302; Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ggnatura"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/ion_creang_ntre_natur_i_cultur "Ion Creangă între natură și cultură"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 44/2004&lt;/ref&gt; His voracious appetite, called "proverbial gluttony" by George Călinescu,&lt;ref name="gc479"/&gt; was attested by contemporary accounts. These depict him consuming uninterrupted successions of whole meals on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="gc479"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ggnatura"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sapoale"&gt;{{ro icon}} Șerban Anghelescu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Povestile-cu-poale-n-briu*articleID_21268-articles_details.html "Poveștile cu poale-n brîu"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 462, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1874, soon after taking over Minister of Education in the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]] cabinet of [[Lascăr Catargiu]], his friend Maiorescu granted Creangă the position of schoolteacher in the Iași area of [[Păcurari]].&lt;ref name="zononcon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;479; Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;234; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;209–210&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, Ion Creangă met and became best friends with [[Mihai Eminescu]], posthumously celebrated as Romania's [[national poet]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;445, 480; Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;232–233, 239–241, 244–245; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;210–212&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to have taken place in summer 1875, when Eminescu was working as an inspector for Maiorescu's Education Ministry, overseeing schools in [[Iași County]]: reportedly, Eminescu was fascinated with Creangă's talents as a raconteur, while the latter admired Eminescu for his erudition.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;233, 239–240, 245; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;210&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Junimea'' reception===
[[File:Din cărţile subscrisului Ion Creangă 1878.jpg|thumb|260px|Page from a [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Romanian Cyrillic]] book in Creangă's collection. Creangă's 1878 [[marginalia]] identify it as a gift from [[Mihai Eminescu]], referred to as "the eminent writer and the greatest poet among Romanians"]]
At around the same time, Creangă also began attending ''[[Junimea]]'', an [[upper class]] literary club presided upon by Maiorescu, whose cultural and political prestige was increasing. This event, literary historian [[Z. Ornea]] argued, followed a time of indecision: as a former Factionalist, Creangă was a natural adversary of the mainstream ''Junimist'' "[[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] orientation", represented by both Maiorescu and Negruzzi, but was still fundamentally committed to Maiorescu's agenda in the field of education.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;234–236&lt;/ref&gt; Literary historians Carmen-Maria Mecu and Nicolae Mecu also argue that, after attending ''Junimea'', the author was able to assimilate some of its innovative teachings into his own style of [[pedagogy]], and thus helped diffuse its message outside the purely academic environment.&lt;ref&gt;Mecu &amp; Mecu, p.&amp;nbsp;189&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact date of his reception is a mystery. According to Maiorescu's own recollections, written some decades after the event, Creangă was in attendance at a ''Junimea'' meeting of 1871, during which [[Gheorghe Costaforu]] proposed to transform the club into a political party.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;230–231&lt;/ref&gt; The information was considered dubious by Z. Ornea, who argued that the episode may have been entirely invented by the ''Junimist'' leader, and noted that it contradicted both Negruzzi's accounts and [[minutes]] kept by [[A. D. Xenopol]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;230–232&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ornea's assessment, with the exception of literary critic [[Vladimir Streinu]], all of Creangă's biographers have come to dismiss Maiorescu's statement.&lt;ref name="zo231"/&gt; Several sources mention that the future writer was introduced to the society by Eminescu, who was an active member around 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;200, 232–233, 244–245; Vianu, Vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;304; Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;210&lt;/ref&gt; This and other details lead Ornea to conclude that membership was granted to Creangă only after the summer break of 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;232–233&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually&lt;ref name="gc479"/&gt; or instantly,&lt;ref name="zo236"&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;236&lt;/ref&gt; Creangă made a positive impression by confirming with the ''Junimist'' ideal of authenticity. He also became treasured for his talkative and jocular nature, self-effacing references to himself as a "peasant", and eventually his debut works, which became subjects of his own public readings.&lt;ref name="gc479-480"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;479–480&lt;/ref&gt; His storytelling soon earned him dedicated spectators, who deemed Creangă's fictional universe a "sack of wonders"&lt;ref name="gc479"/&gt; at a time when the author himself had started casually using the pseudonym ''Ioan Vântură-Țară'' ("Ioan Gadabout").&lt;ref name="scbalurile"&gt;{{ro icon}} Silvia Craus, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140302061834/http://old.ieseanul.ro/articol/ziar/iasi/balurile-junimiii/9487/ "Balurile Junimii"], in ''[[Ieșeanul]]'', February 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although still in his forties, the newcomer was also becoming colloquially known to his colleagues as ''Moș Creangă'' ("Old Man Creangă" or "Father Creangă"), which was a sign of respect and sympathy.&lt;ref name="mc61"&gt;Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;61&lt;/ref&gt; Among Ion Creangă's most dedicated promoters were Eminescu, his former political rival Iacob Negruzzi, [[Alexandru Lambrior]] and [[Vasile Pogor]],&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;236–237; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;18, 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the so-called ''caracudă'' (roughly, "small game") section, which comprised ''Junimists'' who rarely took the floor during public debates, and who were avid listeners of his literary productions&lt;ref name="zo236"/&gt; (it was to this latter gathering that Creangă later dedicated his [[Erotic literature|erotic texts]]).&lt;ref name="scbalurile"/&gt; In parallel to his diversified literary contribution, the former priest himself became a noted voice in ''Junimist'' politics, and, like his new friend Eminescu, voiced support for the group's nationalist faction, in disagreement with the more cosmopolitan and aristocratic segment led by Maiorescu and [[Petre P. Carp]].&lt;ref&gt;Mecu &amp; Mecu, p.&amp;nbsp;187&lt;/ref&gt; By that the late 1870s, he was secretly redirecting political support from the former Factionalists to his new colleagues, as confirmed by an encrypted letter he addressed to Negruzzi in March 1877.&lt;ref name="csmarturii"/&gt;

===Literary consecration===
Autumn 1875 is also often described as his actual debut in fiction prose, with "[[The Mother with Three Daughters-in-Law]]", a [[short story]] first publish in October by the club's magazine ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''.&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;232; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;210&lt;/ref&gt; In all, ''Convorbiri Literare'' would publish 15 works of fiction and the four existing parts of his ''[[Childhood Memories (Creangă)|Childhood Memories]]'' before Creangă's death.&lt;ref name="tvii211"&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;211&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, the decision to begin writing down his stories had been the direct result of Eminescu's persuasion.&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;305; Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;210&lt;/ref&gt; His talent for storytelling and its transformation into writing fascinated his new colleagues. Several among them, including poet [[Grigore Alexandrescu]], tasked [[Experimental psychology|experimental psychologist]] [[Eduard Gruber]] with closely studying Creangă's methods, investigations which produced a report evidencing Creangă's laborious and physical approach to the creative process.&lt;ref name="gudecemb"/&gt; The latter also involved his frequent exchanges of ideas with Vartic, in whom he found his primary audience.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;305; Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;209, 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his fiction writing, the emerging author followed Maiorescu's suggestion and, in 1876, published a work of educational [[methodology]] and the [[phonemic orthography]] favored by ''Junimea'': ''Povățuitoriu la cetire prin scriere după sistema fonetică'' ("Guide to Reading by Writing in the Phonetic System").&lt;ref name="zo234; tvii208"/&gt; It was supposed to become a standard textbook for the training of teachers, but was withdrawn from circulation soon afterward, when the Catargiu cabinet fell.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;234&lt;/ref&gt;

After losing his job as school inspector following the decisions of a hostile [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] executive,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;445&lt;/ref&gt; Mihai Eminescu spent much of his time in ''Bojdeuca'', where he was looked after by the couple. For five months after quarreling with [[Samson Bodnărescu]], his fellow poet and previous landlord, Eminescu even moved inside the house, where he reputedly pursued his discreet love affair with woman writer [[Veronica Micle]], and completed as many as 22 of his poems.&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt; Creangă introduced his younger friend to a circle of companions which included Zahei Creangă, who was by then a cantor, as well as Răceanu, priest Gheorghe Ienăchescu, and clerk Nicșoi (all of whom, Călinescu notes, had come to share the raconteur's lifestyle choices and his nationalist opinions).&lt;ref name="gc480"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;480&lt;/ref&gt; Eminescu was especially attracted by their variant of simple life, the rudimentary setting of Creangă's house and the group's [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] escapades.&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;480; Vianu, Vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;303; Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;210&lt;/ref&gt; Circumstances drew the two friends apart: by 1877, Eminescu had relocated in [[Bucharest]], the capital city, regularly receiving letters in which Creangă was asking him to return.&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt; He was however against Eminescu's plan to marry Veronica Micle, and made his objection known to the poet.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.&amp;nbsp;110&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, as a sign that he was formalizing his own affair with Tinca Vartic, Creangă purchased the ''Bojdeuca'' in her name, paying his former landlord 40 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|Austrian gulden]] in exchange.&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt; That same year, he, Răceanu and Ienăchescu published the textbook ''Geografia județului Iași'' ("The Geography of Iași County"), followed soon after by a map of the same region, researched by Creangă and Răceanu.&lt;ref name="tvii208"/&gt; A final work in the area of education followed in 1880, as a schoolteacher's version of Maiorescu's study of [[Romanian grammar]], ''Regulile limbei române'' ("Rules of the Romanian Language").&lt;ref name="tvii208"/&gt;

===Illness and death===
[[File:Creanga Cuza Bogdan 1885.jpg|thumb|260px|Creangă (top) with [[A. C. Cuza]] and [[N. A. Bogdan]], during [[balneotherapy]] in [[Slănic-Moldova]], 1885]]
[[File:MIon Creangă.jpg|thumb|220px|Creangă's grave in [[Eternitatea Cemetery]], Iași]]
By the 1880s, Creangă had become afflicted with [[epilepsy]], suffering accelerated and debilitating episodes.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;480; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;211, 212. See also Ornea (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;443&lt;/ref&gt; He was also severely overweight, weighing some 120 kilograms (over 250&amp;nbsp;pounds), with a height of 1.85 meters (6&amp;nbsp;feet),&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt; and being teasingly nicknamed ''Burduhănosul'' ("Tubby") by his friends&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scbalurile"/&gt; (although, according to testimonies by his son and daughter-in-law, he did not actually look his size).&lt;ref name="lmmonogr"/&gt;

Despite his activity being much reduced, he still kept himself informed about the polemics agitating Romania's cultural and political scene. He was also occasionally hosting Eminescu, witnessing his friend's struggle with [[mental disorder]]. The two failed to reconnect, and their relationship ended.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;211–212&lt;/ref&gt; After one of the meetings, he recorded that the delusional poet was carrying around a revolver with which to fend off unknown attackers—among the first in a series of episodes which ended with Eminescu's psychiatric confinement and death during June 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;445–446&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, Creangă, like other ''Junimists'', was involved in a clash of ideas with the emerging Romanian [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Atheism|atheistic]] group, rallied around ''[[Contemporanul]]'' magazine. This occurred after ''Contemporanul'' founder [[Ioan Nădejde]] publicly ridiculed ''Învățătoriul copiilor'' over its take on [[creationism]], quoting its claim that "the invisible hand of God" was what made seeds grow into plants.&lt;ref name="gc545"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;545&lt;/ref&gt; Creangă replied with a measure of irony, stating that "had God not pierced the skin over our eyes, we would be unable to see each other's mistakes".&lt;ref name="gc545"/&gt; Nevertheless, Călinescu argued, Nădejde's comments had shaken his adversary's religious sentiment, leading Creangă to question the immortality of the soul in a letter he addressed to one of his relatives in the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;546&lt;/ref&gt; According to other assessments, he was himself an atheist, albeit intimately so.&lt;ref name="lmmonogr"/&gt;

In 1887, the National Liberal Ministry of [[Dimitrie Sturdza]] removed Creangă from his schoolteacher's post, and he subsequently left for Bucharest in order to petition for his [[pension]] rights.&lt;ref name="tvii212"&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;212&lt;/ref&gt; Having hoped to be granted assistance by Maiorescu, he was disappointed when the ''Junimea'' leader would not respond to his request, and, during his final years, switched allegiance to the literary circle founded by [[Nicolae Beldiceanu]] (where he was introduced by Gruber).&lt;ref name="tvii212"/&gt; Among Creangă's last works was a fourth and final part of his ''Memories'', most likely written during 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;236; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;212&lt;/ref&gt; The book remained unfinished, as did the story ''Făt-frumos, fiul iepei'' ("[[Făt-Frumos]], Son of the Mare").&lt;ref name="tvii211"/&gt; He died after an epileptic crisis, on the last day of 1889,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;480; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;211, 212&lt;/ref&gt; his body being buried in Iași's [[Eternitatea Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="icmormant"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.monumenteiasi.ro/monument_memorial.php?id=972 "Ansamblul funerar al scriitorului Ion Creangă"], [http://www.monumenteiasi.ro/monument_memorial.php?id=953 "Bustul scriitorului Ion Creangă"], [http://www.monumenteiasi.ro/monument_memorial.php?id=954 "Mormântul scriitorului Ion Creangă"], entries in [http://www.monumenteiasi.ro/ ''Patrimoniul istoric și arhitectural, Iași, România''] database; retrieved August 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral ceremony was attended by several of Iași's intellectuals ([[Vasile Burlă]], [[A. C. Cuza]], [[Dumitru Evolceanu]], [[Nicolae Iorga]] and [[Artur Stavri]] among them).&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.&amp;nbsp;65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Cultural context===
The impact of Ion Creangă's work within its cultural context was originally secured by ''Junimea''. Seeking to revitalize [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] by recovering authenticity, and reacting against those cultural imports it deemed excessive, the group notably encouraged individual creativity among peasants.&lt;ref name="gc397"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;397&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting back on Maiorescu's role in the process, George Călinescu wrote: "A literary salon where the personal merit would take the forefront did not exist [before ''Junimea''] and, had Creangă been born two decades earlier, he would not have been able to present 'his peasant material' to anyone. Summoning the creativity of the peasant class and placing it in direct contact with the aristocrats is the work of ''Junimea''."&lt;ref name="gc397"/&gt; His cogenerationist and fellow literary historian [[Tudor Vianu]] issued a similar verdict, commenting: "''Junimea'' is itself&amp;nbsp;... an aristocratic society. Nevertheless, it is through ''Junimea'' that surfaced the first gesture of transmitting a literary direction to some writers of rural extraction: a phenomenon of great importance, the neglect of which would render unexplainable the entire subsequent development of our literature."&lt;ref name="tvii213"&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;213&lt;/ref&gt; Also referring to cultural positioning within and outside the group, Carmen-Maria Mecu and Nicolae Mecu took the acceptance of "literate peasants" such as Creangă as exemplary proof of ''Junimist'' "diversity" and "tolerance".&lt;ref&gt;Mecu &amp; Mecu, p.&amp;nbsp;186–187&lt;/ref&gt;

Maiorescu is known to have had much appreciation for Creangă and other writers of peasant origin, such as [[Ion Popovici-Bănățeanu]] and [[Ioan Slavici]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;413; Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;57–58, 65, 67, 70–71, 157&lt;/ref&gt; Late in life, he used this connection to challenge accusations of ''Junimist'' [[elitism]] in the face of criticism from more [[Populism|populist]] traditionalists.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;413; Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;57–58, 70–71&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, ''Junimea'' members in general found Creangă more of an entertainer rather than a serious writer, and treasured him only to the measure where he illustrated their theories about the validity of rural literature as a source of inspiration for cultured authors.&lt;ref name="ggnatura"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;236–239, 252, 258–259; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;211, 214&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[Iacob Negruzzi]] sympathetically but controversially referred to his friend as "a primitive and uncouth talent".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;237; Vianu, Vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;305, 306; Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;211, 214&lt;/ref&gt; Maiorescu's critical texts also provide little individual coverage of Creangă's contributions, probably because these failed to comply exactly with his stratification of literary works into ''poporane'' ("popular", that is anonymous or collective) and otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;124, 238–239, 252&lt;/ref&gt; Tudor Vianu's theory defines Creangă as a prime representative of the "popular [[Literary realism|realism]]" guidelines (as sporadically recommended by the ''Junimist'' doyen himself), cautioning however that Creangă's example was never mentioned in such a context by Maiorescu personally.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;217; Vol. III, p.&amp;nbsp;208–209, 211–212&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he occasionally downplayed his own contribution to literature,&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ggnatura"/&gt; Creangă himself was aware that his texts went beyond records of popular tradition, and made significant efforts to be recognized as an original author (by corresponding with fellow writers and willingly submitting his books to critical scrutiny).&lt;ref name="ggnatura"/&gt; Vianu commented at length on the exact relationship between the narrative borrowed from [[oral tradition]] and Creangă's "somewhat surreptitious" method of blending his own style into the folkloric standard, likening it to the historical process whereby local painters improvised over the strict canons of [[Byzantine art]].&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;213; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;215–216&lt;/ref&gt; Creangă's complex take on individuality and the art of writing was attested by his own foreword to an edition of his collected stories, in which he addressed the reader directly: "You may have read many stupid things since you were put on this Earth. Please read these as well, and where it should be that they don't agree with you, take hold of a pen and come up with something better, for this is all I could see myself doing and did."&lt;ref name="ggnatura"/&gt;

An exception among ''Junimea'' promoters was Eminescu, himself noted for expressing a dissenting social perspective which only partly mirrored Maiorescu's take on conservatism. According to historian [[Lucian Boia]], the "authentic Moldavian peasant" that was Creangă also complemented Eminescu's own "more [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]" peasanthood.&lt;ref name="lb247"&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''Romania: Borderland of Europe'', Reaktion Books, London, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;247. {{ISBN|1-86189-103-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Z. Ornea]] notes that the poet used Creangă's positions to illustrate his own [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnonationalist]] take on [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]], and in particular his claim that rural authenticity lay hidden by a "superimposed stratum" of urbanized [[Minorities of Romania|ethnic minorities]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;239–241&lt;/ref&gt; 20th century critics have described Creangă as one of his generation's most accomplished figures, and a leading exponent of ''Junimist'' literature. This verdict is found in several of Vianu's texts, which uphold Creangă as a great exponent of his generation's literature, comparable to fellow ''Junimea'' members Eminescu, Slavici and [[Ion Luca Caragiale]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;305; Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;136–137, 221–222&lt;/ref&gt; This view complements George Călinescu's definition, placing the Moldavian author in the company of Slavici and Caragiale as one of the "great prose writers" of the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;477–514&lt;/ref&gt; Lucian Boia, who noted that "the triad of Romanian classics" includes Creangă alongside Eminescu and Caragiale, also cautioned that, compared to the other two (with whom "the Romanians have said almost all there is to say about themselves"), Creangă has "a rather more limited register".&lt;ref name="lb247"/&gt;

The frequent comparison between Creangă and Caragiale in particular is seen by Vianu as stemming from both their common "wide-ranging stylistic means" and their complementary positions in relations to two superimposed phenomenons, with Caragiale's depiction of the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]'' as the rough equivalent of Creangă's interest in the peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;217&lt;/ref&gt; The same parallelism is explained by Ornea as a consequence of the two authors' social outlook: "[Their works] have cemented aesthetically the portrayal of two worlds. Creangă's is the peasant world, Caragiale's the suburban and urban one. Two worlds which represent, in fact, two characteristic steps and two sociopolitical models in the evolution of Romanian structures which&amp;nbsp;... were confronting themselves in a process that would later prove decisive."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;229&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same commentator, the two plus Eminescu are their generation's great writers, with Slavici as one "in their immediate succession."&lt;ref name="zo244"&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;244&lt;/ref&gt; While listing what he believes are elements bridging the works of Creangă and Caragiale, other critics have described as strange the fact that the two never appear to have mentioned each other, and stressed that, although not unlikely, a direct encounter between them was never recorded in sources.&lt;ref name="lmmonogr"/&gt;

===Narrative style and language===
Highlighting Ion Creangă's recourse to the particularities of [[Moldavian subdialect of Romanian|Moldavian regionalisms]] and [[archaism]]s, their accumulation making Creangă's work very difficult to translate,&lt;ref&gt;Anca Mureșan, [http://abcjournal.ulbsibiu.ro/Anca%20Muresan.html "The Stylistics of the Parts of the Speech in ''Memories of Childhood''"], in the [[Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu]]'s [http://abcjournal.ulbsibiu.ro/ ''American, British and Canadian Studies''], Vol. V, December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; George Călinescu reacted against claims that the narratives reflected antiquating patterns. He concluded that, in effect, Creangă's written language was the equivalent of a "[[Historical linguistics|glossological]] museum", and even contrasted by the writer's more modern everyday parlance.&lt;ref name="gc480"/&gt; Also discussing the impression that Creangă's work should be read with a Moldavian accent, noted for its "softness of sound" in relation to standard [[Romanian phonology]], Călinescu cautioned against interpretative exaggerations, maintaining that the actual texts only offer faint suggestions of regional pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;480–481&lt;/ref&gt; Contrasting Creangă with the traditions of literature produced by [[Wallachia]]ns in what became the standard [[literary language]], Călinescu also argued in favor of a difference in mentality: the "balance" evidenced by Moldavian speech and illustrated in Ion Creangă's writings is contrasted by the "discoloration and roughness" of "[[Wallachian subdialect of Romanian|Wallachianism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticized those views according to which Creangă's variant of the literary language was "beautiful", since it failed to "please everyone on account of some [[Acoustics|acoustical]] beauty", and since readers from outside the writer's native area could confront it "with some irritation."&lt;ref name="gc481"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;481&lt;/ref&gt; For Călinescu, the result nevertheless displays "an enormous capacity of authentic speech", also found in the works of Caragiale and, in the 20th century, [[Mihail Sadoveanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;631&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same commentator, the dialectical interventions formed a background to a lively vocabulary, a "[[Hermeticism|hermetic]]" type of "[[argot]]", which contained "hilarious [[double entendre]]s and indecent [[onomatopoeia]]", passing from "erudite beauty" to "obscene laughter".&lt;ref name="gc488"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;488&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the expressions characteristic of Creangă's style are obscure in meaning, and some other, such as "drought made the snake scream inside the frog's mouth", appear to be spontaneous and nonsensical.&lt;ref name="gudecemb"/&gt; Another specific trait of this language, commented upon by Vianu's and compared by him to the aesthetics of [[Classicism]], sees much of Creangă's prose being set to a discreet [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meter]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;306; Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;221&lt;/ref&gt;

The recourse to [[oral literature]] schemes made it into his writings, where it became a defining trait. As part of this process, Călinescu assessed, "Creangă acts as all his characters in turn, for his stories are almost entirely spoken.&amp;nbsp;... When Creangă recounts, the composition is not extraordinary, but once his heroes begin talking, their gesticulation and wording reach a height in typical storytelling."&lt;ref name="gc482"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;482&lt;/ref&gt; According to the critic, discovering this "fundamental" notion about Creangă's work was the merit of literary historian and ''[[Viața Românească]]'' editor [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], who had mentioned it as a main proof of affiliation to realism.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;667&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctive manner of characterization through "realistic dialogues" is seen by Vianu as a highly personal intervention and indicator of the Moldavian writer's originality.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;216–221, 229&lt;/ref&gt; Both Vianu and Călinescu discussed this trait, together with the technique of imparting [[Unreliable narrator|subjective narration]] in-between characters' replies, as creating other meeting points between Creangă and his counterpart Caragiale.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;482; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;217, 219&lt;/ref&gt; Partly replicating in paper the essence of social gatherings, Ion Creangă often tried to transpose the particular effects of oral storytelling into writing. Among these characteristic touches were interrogations addressed to the readers as imaginary listeners, and pausing for effect with the visual aid of [[ellipsis]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Moner, ''Cervantès conteur. Écrits et paroles'', [[Casa de Velázquez]], Madrid, 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;81–82. {{ISBN|84-86839-08-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also often interrupted his narratives with concise illustrations of his point, often in verse form, and usually introduced by ''vorba ceea'' (an expression literally meaning "that word", but covering the sense of "as word goes around").&lt;ref name="gc480, 488"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;480, 488&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this connects the notions of abundance and personal satisfaction:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|De plăcinte râde gura,
De vărzare și mai tare.}}&lt;ref name="gc480"/&gt;
|
The mouth will laugh for pie,
It will laugh even harder for cabbage pie.}}

In other cases, the short riddles relate to larger themes, such as divine justification for one's apparent fortune:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Dă-mi, Doamne, ce n-am avut,
Să mă mir ce m-a găsit.}}&lt;ref name="gc480, 488"/&gt;
|
Lord, give me that I did not own,
So that I may marvel at things having found me.}}

===Creangă's specificity===
Despite assuming the external form of traditional literature, Ion Creangă's interests and creative interventions, Călinescu noted, separated him from his roots: "peasants do not have [his] entirely cultured gifts.&amp;nbsp;...  Too much 'atmosphere', too much dialogic 'humor', too much polychromy at the expense of linear epic movements. The peasant wants the bare epic and desires the unreal."&lt;ref name="gc486"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;486&lt;/ref&gt; The commentator passed a similar judgment on the author's use of ancient sayings, concluding that, instead of crystallizing and validating [[Folklore of Romania|local folklore]], the accounts appeal to cultured tastes, having as the generation of comedy and volubility as their main purpose.&lt;ref name="ggnatura"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;487–488&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vianu's assessment Creangă was "a supreme artist"&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;306&lt;/ref&gt; whose use of "typical sayings" attests "a man of the people, but not an anonymous and impersonal sample."&lt;ref name="ggnatura"/&gt; These verdicts, directly contradicting ''Junimist'' theories, were mirrored by several other 20th century exegetes belonging to distinct schools of thought: [[Pompiliu Constantinescu]], [[Benjamin Fondane]] and [[Ion Negoițescu]].&lt;ref name="ggnatura"/&gt; Writing during the second half of the century, critic [[Nicolae Manolescu]] passed a similar judgment, believing that Creangă was motivated by a "strictly intellectual sensuousness" and the notion that "pleasure arises from gratuitousness",&lt;ref name="gudecemb"/&gt; while Manolescu's colleague [[Mircea Braga]] referred to "the great secret of the man who has managed to transfer unaltered the code of popular creativity into the immanence of the cultured one."&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;200&lt;/ref&gt; In Braga's assessment, this synthesis managed "the impossible", but the difficulty of repeating it with each story also resulted in mediocre writings: "from among his few texts, even fewer are located on the relatively highest level of the relative aesthetic hierarchy".&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;214&lt;/ref&gt;

Călinescu viewed such intellectual traits as shared by Creangă with his Wallachian counterpart [[Anton Pann]], in turn linking both writers to the satirical component of [[Renaissance literature]], and specifically to [[François Rabelais]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;487–488, 975&lt;/ref&gt; Within local tradition, the literary historian saw a symbolic connection between Creangă and the early 18th century figure, [[Ion Neculce]], one of Moldavia's leading chroniclers.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;10, 24&lt;/ref&gt; While he made his own comparison between Creangă and Pann, Tudor Vianu concluded that the Moldavian writer was in fact superior, as well as being more relevant to literature than [[Petre Ispirescu]], the prime collector of tales in 19th-century Wallachia.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;304, 306&lt;/ref&gt; Also making use of the Rabelais analogy, literary chronicler Gabriela Ursachi found another analogy in local letters: [[Ion Budai-Deleanu]], an early 19th-century representative of the [[Transylvanian School]], whose style mixes erudite playfulness with popular tastes.&lt;ref name="gudecemb"/&gt; These contextual traits, researchers assess, did not prevent Creangă's overall work from acquiring a universal aspect, particularly since various of his writings use narrative sequences common throughout world literature.&lt;ref&gt;Beza, p.&amp;nbsp;104–105; Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;484; Ornea (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;84; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;215&lt;/ref&gt;

George Călinescu also assessed that these literary connections served to highlight the elevated nature of Creangă's style, his "erudite device", concluding: "Writers such as Creangă can only show up in places where the word is ancient and equivocal, and where experience has been condensed into unchanging formulas. It would have been more natural for such a prose writer to have emerged a few centuries later, into an era of Romanian [[humanism]]. Born much earlier, Creangă showed up where there exists an ancient tradition, and therefore a species of erudition,&amp;nbsp;... in a mountain village&amp;nbsp;... where the people is unmixed and keeping [with tradition]."&lt;ref name="gc488"/&gt; Outlining his own theory about the aspects of "national specificity" in Romanian letters, he expanded on these thoughts, listing Creangă and Eminescu as "core Romanians" who illustrated a "primordial note", complemented by the "southern" and "[[Balkans|Balkan]]" group of Caragiale and others.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;974–975&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming that the "core" presence had "not primitive, but ancient" origins, perpetuated by "[[stereotype]]d wisdom" and "energetic [[fatalism]]", he asserted: "Creangă shows our civilization's contemporaneity with the world's oldest civilizations, our [[Asia]]n age."&lt;ref name="gc975"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;975&lt;/ref&gt; The alternating national and regional characteristics in Creangă's writings are related by historian [[Neagu Djuvara]] with the writer's place of birth, an affluent village in an isolated region, contrasting heavily with the 19th century Wallachian countryside: "if the mud hut villages of the [[Wallachian Plain|Danube flood plain]] are to be taken into account, one finds himself in a different country."&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.&amp;nbsp;227&lt;/ref&gt; Ornea, who noted that Eminescu effectively shared Creangă's worldview, believed the latter to have been dominated by [[nostalgia]] for a world of independent landowning peasants, and argued that Creangă's literary and political outlook were both essentially conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;240–244&lt;/ref&gt; Ornea commented: "One could say that it was through [this form of nostalgia] that the writer debuted and that, within the space of his work it became, in its own right, an expression of the world that was about to vanish."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;241&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on Creangă's "robust realism" and lack of "[[sentimentality]]", Vianu contrarily asserted: "Creangă's nostalgia&amp;nbsp;... has an individual, not social, sense."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;214&lt;/ref&gt;

The witty and playful side of Creangă's personality, which became notorious during his time at ''Junimea'' and constituted a significant part of his appeal, was reflected into a series of [[anecdote]]s. These accounts detail his playing the ignorant in front of fellow ''Junimists'' in order not to antagonize sides during literary debates (notably, by declaring himself "for against" during a two-option vote), his irony in reference to his own admirers (such as when he asked two of them to treasure the photograph of himself in the middle and the two of them on either side, while comparing it to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion scene]] and implicitly assigning them the role of thieves), and his recourse to puns and proverbs which he usually claimed to be citing from oral tradition and the roots of [[Romanian humor]].&lt;ref name="gc479-480"/&gt; The latter habit was notably illustrated by his answer to people who would ask him for money: "not since I born was I as poor as I was poor yesterday and the day before yesterday and last week and last week and throughout life".&lt;ref name="gc480"/&gt; His joyfulness complemented his overall [[Epicureanism]] and his [[gourmand]] habits: his accounts are often marked by a special interest in describing acts related to food and drink.&lt;ref name="sapoale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbgaster"&gt;Simona Brânzaru, [http://www.icr.ro/bucuresti/memento-vivere-23-2004/thoughts-about-a-possible-history-of-gaster-s-presence-in-romanian-literature.html "Thoughts about a Possible History of Gaster's Presence in Romanian Literature"], in ''Plural Magazine'', Nr. 23/2004&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Eduard Gruber]]'s report contended, Creangă's writing relied on him being "a strong sensual and auditive type", and a "very emotional" person.&lt;ref name="gudecemb"/&gt;

Ion Creangă's sense of humor was instrumental in forging the unprecedented characteristics of his work. [[United States|American]] critic Ruth S. Lamb, the writer's style merges "the rich vocabulary of the Moldavian peasant" with "an original gaiety and gusto comparable to that of Rabelais."&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, p.&amp;nbsp;243&lt;/ref&gt; According to George Călinescu: "[Creangă] got the idea that he was a clever man, like all men of the people, and therefore used irony to make himself seem stupid."&lt;ref name="gc479"/&gt; In Călinescu's view, the author's antics had earned him a status equivalent to that of his Wallachian ''Junimist'' counterpart Caragiale, with the exception that the latter found his inspiration in urban settings, matching "[[Nasreddin]]isms" with "[[Mitică|Miticism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;430, 479, 493, 449&lt;/ref&gt; Z. Ornea sees the main protagonists in Creangă's comedic narratives as, in effect, "particularized incarnations of the same symbolic character", while the use of humor itself reflects the traditional mindset, "a survival through intelligence, that of a people with an old history, whose life experience has for centuries been concentrated into gestures and words."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;243&lt;/ref&gt;

===Most prominent tales===
Part of Ion Creangă's contribution to the [[short story]], [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] and [[children's literature]] genres involved collecting and transforming narratives circulating throughout his native region, which intertwine with his characteristic storytelling to the point where they become original contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;56, 487–488&lt;/ref&gt; According to Călinescu, the traditional praise for Ion Creangă as a creator of literary types is erroneous, since his characters primarily answered to ancient and linear narrative designs.&lt;ref name="gc481"/&gt; The conclusion is partly shared by Braga, who links Creangă's tales to [[Ethnology|ethnological]] and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] takes on the themes and purposes of [[fairy tale]]s, postulating the prevalence of three ancient and related narrative pretexts throughout his contributions: the preexistence of a "perturbing situation" (attributable to fatality), the plunging of the hero into a [[Rites of passage|rite of passage]]-type challenge, a [[happy ending]] which brings the triumph of good over evil (often as a brutal and uncompromising act).&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;207–213&lt;/ref&gt; Like their sources and predecessors in folklore, these accounts also carry transparent [[moral]]s, ranging from the regulation of family life to meditations about destiny and lessons about tolerating the marginals.&lt;ref name="gc481"/&gt; However, [[Sweden|Swedish]] researcher [[Tom Sandqvist]] argues, they also illustrate the [[Absurdism|absurdist]] vein of some traditional narratives, by featuring "grotesqueries" and "illogical surprises".&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Sandqvist]], ''Dada East. The Romanians of Cabaret Voltaire'', [[MIT Press]], Cambridge, Massachusetts &amp; London, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;227, 247. {{ISBN|0-262-19507-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With "[[The Goat and Her Three Kids]]", written mainly as a [[picturesque]] illustration of motherly love,&lt;ref name="gc481"/&gt; Creangă produced a [[fable]] in prose, opposing the eponymous characters, caricatures of a garrulous but hard-working woman and her restless sons, to the sharp-toothed [[Big Bad Wolf]], a [[Satire|satirical]] depiction of the cunning and immoral stranger.&lt;ref name="sapoale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc482"/&gt; The plot shows the wolf making his way into the goat's house, where he eats the two older and less obedient kids, while the youngest one manages to escape by hiding up the chimney—the symbolism of which was [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyzed]] by Dan Grădinaru, who claims it constitutes an allusion to Creangă's own childhood.&lt;ref name="lmmonogr"/&gt; The [[dénouement]] sees an inversion of the natural roles, an episode which, ethnologist Șerban Anghelescu notes, is dominated by "the culinary fire": the goat exercises her brutal revenge by trapping and slowly cooking the predator.&lt;ref name="sapoale"/&gt; This approach partly resonates with that of "[[The Mother with Three Daughters-in-Law]]", in which Creangă makes ample use of a traditional theme in Romanian humor, which portrays mothers-in-law as mean, stingy and oppressive characters.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;482; Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;63–65&lt;/ref&gt; The embodiment of such offensive traits, she is also shown to be ingenious, pretending that she has a hidden [[third eye]] which always keeps things under watch.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;64&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator sides with the three young women in depicting their violent retribution, showing them capturing their oppressor, torturing her until she is left speech impaired, and leaving her on the brink of death.&lt;ref name="sapoale"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;482; Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;64–65&lt;/ref&gt; The mother-in-law's end turns into a farce: the eldest and most intelligent of the killers manipulates her victim's dying sounds into a testament partitioning her wealth, and a thin decorum is maintained at the funeral ceremony by the daughters' hypocritical sobbing.&lt;ref name="mc65"&gt;Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;65&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[The Story of the Pig]]" partly illustrates the notion that parental love subdues even physical repulsion, showing an elderly peasant couple cherishing their adopted porcine son, who, unbeknown to them, is enchanted.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;481, 483; Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;65–66&lt;/ref&gt; The creature instantly offsets his parents' sadness and immobility by his witty intelligence.&lt;ref name="mc65"/&gt; Having applied his perseverance and spells to erect a magical bridge, the piglet fulfills the requirement for marrying the emperor's daughter, after which it is uncovered that he is a ''[[Făt-Frumos]]'' or [[Prince Charming]] character who assumes his real identity only by night.&lt;ref name="gc483-484"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;483–484&lt;/ref&gt; Although the plot is supposed to deal with imperial magnificence in fairy tale fashion, the setting is still primarily rural, and the court itself is made to look like an elevated peasant community.&lt;ref name="gc483-484"/&gt; According to researcher [[Marcu Beza]], the text is, outside of its humorous context, a distant reworking of ancient legends such as ''[[Cupid and Psyche]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beza, p.&amp;nbsp;104–105&lt;/ref&gt; The story introduces three additional characters, old women who assess and reward the efforts of the virtuous: Holy Wednesday, Holy Friday and Holy Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;210; Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;66–67&lt;/ref&gt; They represent a mix of Christian and [[Paganism|pagan]] traditions, by being both personifications of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical calendar]] and [[fairy]]-like patrons of the wilderness (''[[Zână|zâne]]'').&lt;ref name="mc66-67"&gt;Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;66–67&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar perspective was favored by "[[The Old Man's Daughter and the Old Woman's Daughter]]". Here, the theme echoes ''[[Cinderella]]'', but, according to [[Călinescu]], the rural setting provides a sharp contrast to the classical motif.&lt;ref name="gc484"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;484&lt;/ref&gt; Persecuted by her stepmother and stepsister, the kind and loving daughter of the old man is forced into a position of servitude reflecting the plight of many peasant women in Creangă's lifetime.&lt;ref name="gc484"/&gt; In this case, the old man is negatively depicted as cowardly and entirely dominated by his mean wife.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;68&lt;/ref&gt; The focal point of the narrative is the meeting between the good daughter and Holy Sunday. The latter notices and generously rewards the girl's helpful nature and mastery of cooking; in contrast, when her envious sister attempts the same and fails, she ends up being eaten by serpent-like creatures (''[[balaur]]i'').&lt;ref name="sapoale"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;67–68&lt;/ref&gt; The [[happy ending]] sees the good girl marrying not Prince Charming, but a simple man described as "kind and industrious"—this outcome, Călinescu assessed, did not in effect spare the old man's daughter from a life of intense labor.&lt;ref name="gc484"/&gt; A story very similar to "The Old Man's Daughter ..." is "The Purse a' Tuppence", which teaches that greed can shatter families,&lt;ref name="mc65"/&gt; while offering symbolic retribution to men who are unhappy in marriage.&lt;ref name="gc481"/&gt; The old man's rooster, chased away by the old woman for being unproductive, ends up amassing a huge fortune, which he keeps inside his belly and regurgitates back into the courtyard; the [[jealous]] old woman ends up killing her favorite hen, who has failed in replicating the rooster's feat.&lt;ref name="sapoale"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;207, 210, 212&lt;/ref&gt;

===Devil-themed stories and "Harap Alb"===
[[File:Sf Elefterie 4.jpg|thumb|290px|Depiction of Hell in an 18th-century [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] mural ([[Sfântul Elefterie Vechi]], [[Bucharest]])]]
Several of Creangă's characteristic [[novella]]s are infused with themes from [[Christian mythology]], fictionalizing God, [[Saint Peter]] and the [[Christian teaching about the Devil|army of devils]], most often with the comedic intent of showing such personages behaving like regular people.&lt;ref name="lb247"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;482–483, 484&lt;/ref&gt; A defining story in this series is "[[Dănilă Prepeleac]]", whose eponymous peasant hero is characterized by what Șerban Anghelescu calls "idiocy serving to initiate",&lt;ref name="sapoale"/&gt; or, according to Gabriela Ursachi, "complete, and therefore sublime, stupidity."&lt;ref name="gudecemb"/&gt; The first part of the story shows Dănilă exchanging his oxen for an empty bag—a set of dialogues which, George Călinescu argued, is almost exactly like a comedy play.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;482–483&lt;/ref&gt; In what was described as a complete reversal in characterization, the hero uses intelligence and ruse to trick and frighten several devils.&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;209, 210, 212–213&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily, "[[Stan Pățitul]]" shows its hero fraternizing with a lesser demon. Following the opening episode, in which the latter accidentally eats a bit of ''[[mămăligă]]'' dedicated by Stan to those who honor God, [[Satan]] himself condemns his subordinate to service the peasant.&lt;ref name="sapoale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc484"/&gt; Călinescu highlights the naturalness of exchanges between the two protagonists, the latter of whom assumes the endearing form of a frail boy, Chirică, who ends up moving in with Stan and entering his service.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;483&lt;/ref&gt; The writing was also noted for other realistic elements alluding to everyday life, such as the overtly colloquial exchange between Chirică and Satan, or the episodes in which the young devil helps Stan woo a peasant woman.&lt;ref name="gc484"/&gt; Although relatively young, Stan himself is referred to as ''stătut'' ("frowzy" or "lacking in freshness"), and the wording reflects rural attitudes about men who fail to marry during a certain age interval.&lt;ref name="mc69"&gt;Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;69&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end, the story focuses on a corrupt old woman who tries to trick Stan's new wife into committing adultery, but fails and is banished to the remotest area of Hell.&lt;ref name="mc69"/&gt; Viewed by Călinescu as Creangă's "most original manner of dealing with the fabulous", and paralleled by him with Caragiale's ''[[Kir Ianulea]]'' on account of its realist approach to the supernatural,&lt;ref name="gc483-484"/&gt; "Stan Pățitul" is, according to Vianu, untraceable in its inspiration: "[its] folk origin could not be identified, but it is not dismissible".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;215&lt;/ref&gt;

Another account in this series is "[[Ivan Turbincă]]", whose protagonist, a [[Russia]]n serviceman, is shown rebelling against Heaven and Hell, and ultimately accomplishing the human ideal of [[cheating Death]].&lt;ref name="mc70-71"&gt;Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;70–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tpenemies"&gt;[[Tudor Pamfile]], [http://www.icr.ro/bucharest/creation-and-destruction-in-folk-culture-24-2004/enemies-and-friends-of-man-ii.html "Enemies and Friends of Man II" (excerpts)], in ''Plural Magazine'', Nr. 24/2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ampspatiul"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ana-Maria Plămădeală, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120219032647/http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20030115/article_28/ "Spațiul fascinant în care muzica se întîlnește cu filmul"], in ''[[Revista Sud-Est]]'', April 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The plot retells a theme present in both Romanian tradition and [[Ukrainian folklore]],&lt;ref name="tpenemies"/&gt; while, according to researcher of children's literature Muguraș Constantinescu, the main character is similar to [[German folklore|German tradition]]'s [[Till Eulenspiegel]].&lt;ref name="mc70"&gt;Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;70&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of the account, God rewards the soldier's exemplary charity by granting him a pouch (''turbincă''), which can miraculously trap anything in existence.&lt;ref name="mc70"/&gt; In order to circumvent the laws of nature, Ivan subsequently makes use of both his magical item and his innate shrewdness. In one such episode, pretending not to understand the proper position of bodies inside a coffin, he tricks impatient Death into taking his place, and traps her inside.&lt;ref name="tpenemies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mc70"/&gt; Eventually, he is allowed to keep his life, but is promised an eternity of old age, which he ingeniously counterbalances by attending an endless succession of wedding parties, and therefore never having to feel sad.&lt;ref name="mc70-71"/&gt;

"[[Harap Alb]]", one of Ion Creangă's most complex narratives, carries a moral defined by Călinescu as "the gifted man will earn a reputation under any guise."&lt;ref name="gc481"/&gt; The story opens with a [[coming of age]] quest, handed down by a king to his three sons: the most fit among them is supposed to reach the court of the Green Emperor, who is the king's brother, and succeed him to the throne. According to Călinescu, the mission bases itself on travels undertaken by young men in Creangă's native region, while the subsequent episodes in the narrative reinforce the impression of familiarity, from the "peasant speech" adopted by the [[villain]] known as the Bald Man, to the "crass vulgarity" evidenced by the [[antagonist]] Red Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;484–485&lt;/ref&gt; Forced to pass himself off as a foreign servant (or "[[Moors|Moor]]"), the prince is three times tested and aided by Holy Sunday, who doubles as the queen of ''[[Zână|zâne]]'' creatures.&lt;ref name="mc66-67"/&gt; Călinescu described as "playful realism" the method through which Creangă outlined the mannerisms of several other characters, in particular the [[Allegory|allegorical]] creatures who provide the youngest prince with additional and serendipitous assistance.&lt;ref name="gc485"&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;485&lt;/ref&gt; In one noted instance, the characters ''Setilă'' ("Drink-All") and ''Flămânzilă'' ("Eat-All") help the hero overcome seemingly impossible tasks set by the Red Emperor, by ingesting unnaturally huge amounts of food and drink.&lt;ref name="sbgaster"/&gt;

The tale builds on intricate symbolism stemming from obscure sources. It features what Muguraș Constantinescu calls "the most complex representation of Holy Sunday", with mention of her isolated and heavenly abode on "flower island".&lt;ref name="mc66-67"/&gt; A background [[antithesis]] opposes the two fictional monarchs, with the Red Emperor replicating an ancient tradition which attributes malignant characteristics to the color.&lt;ref name="mc69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amkhazar"&gt;Adrian Majuru, [http://www.icr.ro/bucuresti/the-continent-of-romania-romania-s-national-minorities-27-2006/khazar-jews-romanian-history-and-ethnography.html "Khazar Jews. Romanian History and Ethnography" (excerpts)], in ''Plural Magazine'', Nr. 27/2006&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the Green Emperor probably illustrates the ideals of vitality and healthy lifestyle, as hinted by his culinary preference for "lettuce from the garden of the bear".&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;68–69, 71&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Adrian Majuru, building on earlier observations made by linguist [[Lazăr Șăineanu]], also connects the servant-prince's antagonists with various reflections of ethnic strife in Romanian folklore: the Red Emperor as standing for the medieval [[Khazars]] ("[[Red Jews]]"), the Bald Man as a popular view of the [[Tatars]].&lt;ref name="amkhazar"/&gt;

===''Childhood Memories''===
{{main|Childhood Memories (Creangă)}}
[[File:Ion Creanga - Manuscris Amintiri, prima pagina.jpg|thumb|280px|The second part of ''[[Childhood Memories (Creangă)|Childhood Memories]]'' in manuscript form, introductory paragraphs]]
''[[Childhood Memories (Creangă)|Childhood Memories]]'' is, together with a short story about his teacher [[Isaia Teodorescu]] (titled "Popa Duhu"),&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;208; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;207&lt;/ref&gt; one of Creangă's two [[memoir]]s. George Călinescu proposed that, like his fairy tales, the book illustrates popular narrative conventions, a matter accounting for their special place in literature: "The stories are true, but typical, without depth. Once retold with a different kind of gesticulation, the subject would lose all of its lively atmosphere."&lt;ref name="gc481"/&gt; Also based on the techniques of traditional oral accounts, it features the topical interventions of a [[First-person narrative|first-person narrator]] in the form of [[Soliloquy|soliloquies]], and reflects in part the literary canon set by [[Frame story|frame stories]].&lt;ref name="gc481"/&gt; The resulting effect, Călinescu argued, was not that of "a confession or a diary", but that of a symbolic account depicting "the childhood of the universal child."&lt;ref name="gc481"/&gt; According to Vianu, the text is especially illustrative of its author's "spontaneous passage" between the levels of "popular" and "cultured" literature: "The idea of fictionalizing oneself, of outlining one's formative steps, the steady accumulation of impressions from life, and then the sentiment of time, of its irreversible flow, of regret for all things lost in its consumption, of the charm relived through one's recollections are all thoughts, feelings and attitudes defining a modern man of culture. No popular model could have ever stood before Creangă when he was writing his ''Memories'', but, surely, neither could the cultured prototypes of the genre, the first autobiographies and memoirs of the Renaissance".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;220&lt;/ref&gt; Grădinaru and essayist Mircea Moț analyzed the volume as a fundamentally sad text, in stated contrast with its common perception as a recollection of joyful moments: the former focused on moments which seem to depict Nică as a loner,&lt;ref name="lmmonogr"/&gt; the latter highlighted those sections which include Creangă's bitter musings about destiny and the impregnability of changes.&lt;ref name="ggnatura"/&gt; A distinct interpretation was provided by critic [[Luminița Marcu]], who reacted against the tradition of viewing Creangă's actual childhood as inseparable from his own subjective rendition.&lt;ref name="lmmonogr"/&gt;

Several of the book's episodes have drawn attention for the insight they offer into the culture, structure and conflicts of traditional society before 1900. Commenting on this characteristic, Djuvara asserted: "even if we take into account that the grown-up will embellish, transfigure, 'enrich' the memories of his childhood, how could we not recognize the sincerity in Creangă's heart-warming evocation of his childhood's village?"&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.&amp;nbsp;226&lt;/ref&gt; The book stays true to life in depicting ancient customs: discussing the impact of paganism on traditional Romanian customs, Marcu Beza communicated a detail of Creangă's account, which shows how January 1 celebrations of [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil]] opposed the loud ''[[Buhay|buhai]]'' players reenacting a [[fertility rite]] to people preferring a quieter celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Beza, p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt; The work also offers details on the traditional roles of a rural society such as that of Humulești, in the context of social change. Muguraș Constantinescu highlights the important roles of old men and women within Nică's universe, and especially that of his grandfather and "[[clan]] leader" David Creangă.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;62–63&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, she notes, is an "enlightened man" displaying "the wisdom and balance of the ripe age", a person able to insist on the importance of education, and a churchgoer who frowns on "his wife's [[bigotry]]."&lt;ref name="mc62"&gt;Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;62&lt;/ref&gt; The seniors' regulatory role within the village is evidenced throughout the book, notoriously so in the episode where the boy captures a [[hoopoe]] who bothers his morning sleep, only to be tricked into releasing it by old man, who understands the bird's vital role as village alarm clock.&lt;ref name="mc62"/&gt;

Another significant part of the account, detailing Creangă's education, shows him frustrated by the old methods of teaching, insisting on the absurd image of children learning by heart and chanting elements of [[Romanian grammar]] and even whole texts.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;235–236&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator refers to this method as "a terrible way to stultify the mind".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;235&lt;/ref&gt; The negative portrayal of teaching priests was commented by writer and critic [[Horia Gârbea]] as proof of the author's [[anticlericalism]], in line with various satirical works targeting the Romanian clergy: "Creangă's ''Memories'' of the [[catechism]] school would discourage any candidate."&lt;ref&gt;Gârbea, p.&amp;nbsp;127–128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Didactic writings===
Creangă's contribution to literature also covers a series of [[Didacticism|didactic]] fables written as lively dialogues, among them "The Needle and the Sledge Hammer", in which the objects of traditional [[metalworking]] scold the byproducts of their work for having forgotten their lowly origin.&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;206–207; Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;485&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration behind this theme was identified by Călinescu as "The Story of a Gold Coin", written earlier by Creangă's ''Junimist'' colleague [[Vasile Alecsandri]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;317, 485&lt;/ref&gt; A similar piece, "The Flax and the Shirt", reveals the circuit of fibers from weed-like plants into recycled cloth, leading to the conclusion that "all things are not what they seem; they were something else once, they are something else now;—and shall become something else."&lt;ref name="gc485"/&gt; The technique employed by Creangă has the flax plant teaching the less knowledgeable textile, a dialogue which Călinescu likened to that between old women in a traditional society.&lt;ref name="gc485"/&gt; Included alongside the two stories were: ''Pâcală'', a writing which, Mircea Braga argued, is not as much didactic as it is a study in dialogue; "The Bear Tricked by the Fox", which uses legendary and humorous elements in an attempt to explain why bears are the tail-less species among mammals; and ''Cinci pâini'' ("Five Loafs of Bread"), which serves as a condemnation of greed.&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;206, 208, 212&lt;/ref&gt;

With "Human Stupidity", Creangă builds a fable about incompetence in its absolute forms. The story centers on a peasant's quest to find people who are less rational than his wife, having been infuriated by her panic at the remote possibility that a ball of salt could fall from its place of storage and kill their baby. This, essayist and chronicler Simona Vasilache argues, highlights "a family-based division" of illogical behavior, in which women are depicted as the main propagators of both "astonishing nonsense" and "prudent stupidity".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Simona Vasilache, [http://www.romlit.ro/drobul_de_sare "Drobul de sare"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 44/2007&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, literary critic Ion Pecie identified inside the narrative a meditation on "the link between spirit and nature", with the unpredictable ball of salt representing the equivalent of a "[[sphinx]]".&lt;ref name="ggreviz"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/un_soi_de_revizuiri "Un soi de revizuiri"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 23/2003&lt;/ref&gt; His colleague [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]] argued that such conclusions "may seem excessive", but that they were ultimately validated by the literary work being "a plurality of levels".&lt;ref name="ggreviz"/&gt; A similar piece is the prose fable "The Story of a Lazy Man": fed up with the protagonist's proverbial indolence, which has led him as far as to view chewing food as an effort, his fellow villagers organize a [[lynching]].&lt;ref name="sapoale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ggreviz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mb212"&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;212&lt;/ref&gt; This upsets the sensibility of a noblewoman who happens to witness the incident. When she offers to take the lazy man into her care and feed him [[bread crumbs]], he seals his own fate by asking: "But are your bread crumbs soft?"&lt;ref name="sapoale"/&gt; The peculiar effect of this moral is underlined by Anghelescu: "The lazy man dies as a [[martyr]] of his own immobility."&lt;ref name="sapoale"/&gt; Braga interpreted the story as evidence of "the primacy of ethics" over social aspects in the local tradition.&lt;ref name="mb212"/&gt; Ion Pecie saw in the story proof of Creangă's own support for [[Capital punishment in Romania|capital punishment]] with a preventive or didactic purpose, even in cases were the fault was trivial or imagined, concluding: "Here,&amp;nbsp;... Creangă loses much of his depth."&lt;ref name="ggreviz"/&gt; Pecie's conclusion was treated with reserve by Grigurcu, who believed that, instead, the narrator refrains from passing any judgment on "the community's instinctual [[Eugenics|eugenic]] reaction".&lt;ref name="ggreviz"/&gt;

Partly didactic in scope, several of Creangă's [[anecdote]]s involve [[Ion Roată]], a representative to the [[ad hoc Divan|''ad hoc'' Divan]] which voted in favor of [[United Principalities|Moldo-Wallachian union]], and the newly elected ''[[Domnitor]]'' [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]]. The texts convey a sense of tension between the traditional [[boyar]] aristocracy and the peasant category, closely reflecting, according to historian Philip Longworth, a conflict mounting during the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Longworth, ''The Making of Eastern Europe'', [[Macmillan Publishers]], Houndmills &amp; London, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;136, 155. {{ISBN|0-333-66804-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is argued by Ornea, who also proposes that the protagonist offers insight into Creangă's own conservative reflexes and his complex views on the union, while outlining several connections which the brand of [[social criticism]] professed by ''Junimea''.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;242–243&lt;/ref&gt; Although Roată, a real-life person, was a representative of the pro-union [[National Party (Romania)|National Party]], his main interest, according to the stories themselves, was in curbing the boyars' infringement of peasant rights.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;61; Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;242–243&lt;/ref&gt; The stories' narrator directs his hostility not at boyars in general, but at the younger [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] ones, whom he portrays as gambling on Moldavia's future: "[There was] a clash of ideas opposing old boyars to the youth of Moldavia's ''ad hoc'' Divan, even though both were in favor of 'Union'. It's only that the old ones wanted a negotiated 'Union', and the young ones a 'Union' done without proper thinking, as it came to pass."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;242&lt;/ref&gt; According to Muguraș Constantinescu: "[Roată] opposes the intelligence of common folk, their common sense, their humor and the pleasure of allegorical discourse to the pompous and hollow speeches of some politicians".&lt;ref name="mc61"/&gt; In this context, Cuza's presence is depicted as both legitimate and serendipitous, as he takes a personal interest in curbing boyar abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;208, 211&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Moș Nichifor Coțcariul'' and "corrosives"===
Seen by Romanian critic Radu Voinescu as an extended anecdote,&lt;ref name="rv1127"&gt;Voinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;1127&lt;/ref&gt; the [[novella]] ''Moș Nichifor Coțcariul'' ("Old Man Nichifor Slyboots") establishes a connection with the language of fairy tales, being located in a legendary and non-historical age.&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;208–209&lt;/ref&gt; It details the elaborate seduction of a young [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] bride by a worldly Moldavian wagoner, on the route between [[Târgu Neamț]] and [[Piatra Neamț|Piatra]]. The episode, which the text itself indicates is just one in a series of Nichifor's conquests among his female clients, highlights the seducer's verbose monologue, which covers accounts of his unhappy marriage, allusions about the naturalness of physical love, and intimidating suggestions that wolves may be tempted to attack the wagon (prompting the young woman to seek refuge in his arms).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;486–487, 488&lt;/ref&gt; The seducer's behavior, Constantinescu notes, presents an alternative to the theme of old age as a time of immobility: "the still-green old man, the rake, the joker who enjoys his amorous escapades, while justifying them by the natural course of life".&lt;ref name="mc62"/&gt; Nichifor mostly expresses himself with the help of folk sayings, which he casually mixes in with personal observations about the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;486–487; Constantinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;62&lt;/ref&gt; The background to the plot is a record of various [[superstition]]s, some [[Anti-clericalism|anticlerical]] or antisemitic: Nichifor voices the belief that priests crossing one's path will produce bad luck, as well as the claim that Jewish [[Apothecary|apothecaries]] sold "poisons".&lt;ref&gt;Oișteanu, p.&amp;nbsp;189, 223, 349&lt;/ref&gt;

The reception of ''Moș Nichifor Coțcariul'' by ''Junimea'' illustrated its ambivalence toward Creangă. Maiorescu found the text "interesting in its way and decisively Romanian", but asked ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' journal to either modify it or refrain from publishing it altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;237, 252&lt;/ref&gt; This was complemented by its author's own self-effacing assessment: calling the text "a childish thing", he suggested to Maiorescu that revisions were needed, stating "I have written it long, because there was no time for me to write it short."&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt; Contrarily, the writer's posterity referred to it as one of the greatest Romanian contributions to the genre: according to George Călinescu, the insight into Nichifor's musings resulted in transforming the writing as a whole into "the first great Romanian novella with a stereotypical hero",&lt;ref name="gudecemb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc486"/&gt; while Voinescu described the entire story as "a true masterpiece."&lt;ref name="rv1127"/&gt;

The narrative approaches of ''Moș Nichifor Coțcariul'' bordered on Creangă's contributions to [[erotic literature]], pieces collectively known as "corrosives"&lt;ref name="gudecemb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;479, 488; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;213&lt;/ref&gt; and which have for long treated with discretion by literary historians. In Călinescu's view, this chapter in Creangă's literature created another link between the Moldavian writer and the Renaissance tradition of Rabelais: "All Rabelaisians have penetrated deeply into the realm of vulgarity."&lt;ref name="gc488"/&gt; The taste for titillating accounts was also cultivated by ''Junimea'' members, who discreetly signaled their wish to hear more explicit content by asking Creangă to recount stories from "the wide street".&lt;ref name="gudecemb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ccbrumaru"&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Cubleșan, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/CUBLESANdec8.html "Erosul ca formă a revoltei"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A product of this context, ''Moș Nichifor Coțcariul'' itself is said to have had at least one sexually explicit variant, circulated orally.&lt;ref name="rv1127"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ccbrumaru"/&gt;

Two stories with explicit [[Pornography|pornographic]] content survive as samples of Creangă's erotic authorship: "The Tale of Ionică the Fool" and "The Tale of All Tales" (also known as ''Povestea pulei'', "Tale of the Dick" or "Tale of the Cock"). The former shows its cunning hero having intercourse with a priest's daughter, moving between prose and verse to describe the act.&lt;ref name="scbalurile"/&gt; "The Tale of All Tales", which makes ample use of [[Romanian profanity|vulgar speech]], recounts how a peasant disrespectful of divinity has his entire maize harvest transformed into male genitalia, but is able to turn out a profit by catering to the sexual appetites of women.&lt;ref name="mimaruntisuri"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mircea Iorgulescu]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060510123000/http://www.cultura-fcr.ro/IMAGINI/PDF/Numarul%208%20pagina.pdf "Mărunțișuri"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 8/2006&lt;/ref&gt; The final section, seen by Gârbea as a sample of anticlerical jeers recorded by "the defrocked Creangă", depicts the rape of a priest by one such sexual object.&lt;ref&gt;Gârbea, p.&amp;nbsp;130&lt;/ref&gt; Although explicit, literary historian [[Alex. Ștefănescu]] argued, the text "is refined and full of charm".&lt;ref name="astalent"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alex. Ștefănescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/dac_talent_nu_e.. "Dacă talent nu e&amp;nbsp;..."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210080251/http://www.romlit.ro/dac_talent_nu_e.. |date=2008-12-10 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 40/2008&lt;/ref&gt; While acknowledging both "corrosives" for their "popular charm" in the line of Rabelais and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], and noting that they still display the author's place as a "great stylist", Voinescu also signaled the texts' "very obvious" debt to folkloric sources.&lt;ref&gt;Voinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;1128&lt;/ref&gt; In his definition, Ion Creangă is "possibly the only writer" to draw on the legacy of "luscious popular jests" found in local "erotic folklore".&lt;ref name="rv1127"/&gt; Nevertheless, according to literary critic [[Mircea Iorgulescu]], "The Tale of All Tales" may in fact be based on ''Parapilla'', a pornographic leaflet circulating in [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name="mimaruntisuri"/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Estate, family and early cultural impact===
Soon after the Creangă's death, efforts began to collect his manuscript writings and the updated versions of his printed works. This project involved his son Constantin, alongside [[A. D. Xenopol]], [[Grigore Alexandrescu]] and [[Eduard Gruber]], the latter of whom obtained the works from Tinca Vartic.&lt;ref name="tvii212"/&gt; The first edition was published as two volumes, in 1890–1892, but the project came to an abrupt halt due to Gruber's insanity and death.&lt;ref name="tvii212"/&gt; Creangă's final known work, the fragment of ''Făt-frumos, fiul iepei'', was published by ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' in 1898.&lt;ref name="tvii211"/&gt; The Gruber copies were sold to a Dr. Mendel, and only a part of them was recovered by exegetes, alongside various fragments accidentally discovered at Iași market, where they were being used for wrapping paper.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;212–213&lt;/ref&gt; The collection, structured into a whole by folklorist [[Gheorghe T. Kirileanu]], was published by [[Editura Minerva]] in 1902 and 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;215; Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;212–213&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being mentioned in the memoirs of several prominent ''Junimists'', Creangă had his political career fictionalized and satirized by [[Iacob Negruzzi]], who transformed him, as ''Popa Smântână'', into a character of his satirical poems ''Electorale'' ("Electorals").&lt;ref name="gc435; zo231; tvii207"/&gt; The same author referred to his counterpart in one of his [[epigram]]s.&lt;ref name="scbalurile"/&gt;

Shortly after her lover's death, Tinca Vartic married a man who lived in the same part of Iași.&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt; The target of organized tourism from as early as 1890,&lt;ref name="mlrdacia"/&gt; the Iași ''[[Ion Creangă Memorial House, Iași|Bojdeuca]]'' nevertheless fell into disrepair.&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt; It was eventually purchased by a "Ion Creangă Committee", whose members included Constantin Creangă,&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt; Kirileanu and the ultra-nationalist politician [[A. C. Cuza]].&lt;ref name="monumbojd"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.monumenteiasi.ro/monument_memorial.php?id=978 "Bojdeuca scriitorului Ion Creangă"], entry in [http://www.monumenteiasi.ro/ ''Patrimoniul istoric și arhitectural, Iași, România''] database; retrieved August 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It was set up as the first of Romania's "memorial houses" on April 15, 1918.&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mlrdacia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="monumbojd"/&gt; Restored the same year and again in 1933–1934,&lt;ref name="mlrdacia"/&gt; it houses an important part of Creangă's personal items and the first known among Creangă's portraits, painted by his contemporary V. Mușnețanu.&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mlrdacia"/&gt; While Constantin Creangă had a successful career in the [[Romanian Army]],&lt;ref name="tvii212"/&gt; one of the writer's two grandsons, [[Horia Creangă]], became one of the celebrated [[Modern architecture|modern architect]]s of the [[interwar period]], earning his reputation by redesigning much of downtown [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110608154231/http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/nepotul-lui-creanga-a-cladit-bucurestiul-412567.html "Nepotul lui Creangă a clădit Bucureștiul"], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', September 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of Ion Creangă's accounts outside his regional and dialectal context, together with his own contribution as an educator, played a part in the [[History of the Romanian language|evolution of standard Romanian]], at a new phase in which many dialectal variations were incorporated into the spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Erfurt, "Dimensiunile sociolingvistice ale limbii române vorbite", in Klaus Bochmann (ed.), ''Limba română vorbită în Moldova istorică'', Vol. I, [[University of Leipzig|Leipziger Universitätsverlag]], Leipzig, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;31. {{ISBN|3-936522-08-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His primers ''Metodă nouă&amp;nbsp;...'' and ''Învățătoriul copiilor'' went through many editions during the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="apspatiul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zo233-234"/&gt; The impact of his works was also a contributing factor to preserving a noted interest in rural subjects, a subsequent defining trait in modern Romanian literature. Discussing "stylistic harmony", which he believed to be bridging all of Romania's social and literary environments, philosopher [[Mircea Eliade]] wrote: "Romanians consider Ion Creangă a classic writer belonging to the modern age. His work can be read and understood by the entire range of social classes, in all the provinces of our country. In spite of the abundant presence of Moldavian words in his writings, the work would not remain a stranger to its readers. What other European culture can take pride in having a classic writer read by all categories of readers?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Eliade]], [http://www.icr.ro/bucuresti/creation-and-destruction-in-folk-culture-24-2004/the-museum-of-the-romanian-village.html "The Museum of the Romanian Village"], in ''Plural Magazine'', Nr. 24/2004&lt;/ref&gt; The "thematic grip of the village" was noted by [[United States|American]] academic [[Harold Segel]], who investigated its impact on "some of the most revered names in the history of Romanian literature", from Creangă and Slavici to interwar novelist [[Liviu Rebreanu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Segel]], ''The Columbia Literary History of Eastern Europe Since 1945'', [[Columbia University Press]], New York &amp; Chichester, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;55. {{ISBN|978-0-231-13306-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century and interwar echoes===
[[File:Stamp 1937 Ion Creanga 6 lei.jpg|thumb|250px|Ion Creangă, as depicted on a 1937 Romanian stamp]]
A more thorough evaluation of Creangă's literature began after 1900. At the time, it became a topic of interest to the emerging traditionalist and populist trend, illustrated by the two venues rivaling ''Junimea'': the [[right-wing]] ''[[Sămănătorul]]'', led by [[Nicolae Iorga]], and the [[left-wing]] [[Poporanism|Poporanists]], among which was [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;199–200; Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;238; Vianu, Vol. III, p.&amp;nbsp;38, 79–80, 209, 211, 242, 244&lt;/ref&gt; The new editions of his works enlisted the collaboration of ''Sămănătorist'' intellectuals [[Ilarie Chendi]] and [[Ștefan Octavian Iosif]].&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;215&lt;/ref&gt; Tudor Vianu however noted that, unlike Eminescu's outlook, Creangă's "authentic ruralism" did not complement the "spiritual complications", global [[social class]] perspective and intellectual background associated with these trends, making Creangă "the least ''Sămănătorist'' among our writers."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.&amp;nbsp;213–214&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ornea, Creangă has "nothing in common" with the ''Sămănătorul'' ideology in particular: while the group shared his nostalgic outlook on the rural past in stark contrast to the modernized world, the Moldavian author could "maintain, intelligently, the middle ground between contraries".&lt;ref name="zo244"/&gt; Likewise, Mircea Braga reacted against the perception of Creangă as announcing a "series" of authors, noting that, for all imitation, he was "an exceptional and, as far as Romanian literary history goes, unique creator."&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;213&lt;/ref&gt;

Directly influenced by Creangă, several early 20th century and interwar authors within the new traditionalist trend explicitly stood for the legacy of folkloric, spontaneous and unskilled literature: the peasant writer [[I. Dragoslav]], whose memoirs borrow stylistic elements from Creangă's accounts; [[Constantin Sandu-Aldea]], an agriculturalist by profession, who took inspiration from his techniques of rendering dialogue; and [[Ion Iovescu]], whom the ''[[Sburătorul]]'' literary circle acclaimed as "a new Creangă", and who made ample use of a modernized [[Muntenia]]n dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;635, 726, 930&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] activist and author [[Nicolae Constantin Batzaria]], who divided his career between Romania and the southern [[Balkans]], combined Creangă's storytelling techniques with the traditions of [[Turkish literature]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Kemal H. Karpat]], "The Memoirs of N. Batzaria: The Young Turks and Nationalism", in ''Studies on Ottoman Social and Political History'', [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden, Boston &amp; Cologne, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;565. {{ISBN|90-04-12101-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the reworking of regional folklore themes earned intellectual [[Constantin S. Nicolăescu-Plopșor]] a reputation as "the [[Oltenia]]n Creangă".&lt;ref&gt;Aurelian I. Popescu, postface to [[Constantin S. Nicolăescu-Plopșor]], ''Tivisoc și Tivismoc'', [[Scrisul Românesc]], Craiova, 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;145&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1910s, folklorist [[Tudor Pamfile]] published a specialized magazine named ''[[Ion Creangă (magazine)|Ion Creangă]]'' in honor of the writer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agnes Murgoci]], "The Vampire in Roumania", in [[Alan Dundes]], ''The Vampire: A Casebook'', [[University of Wisconsin Press]], Madison, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;16sqq. {{ISBN|0-299-15924-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creangă's various works also provided starting points for several other writers of diverse backgrounds. They included representatives of the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Symbolist movement]], such as [[Victor Eftimiu]], who was inspired by Creangă's narrative style in writing his fantasy and verse play ''[[Înșir'te mărgărite]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;714&lt;/ref&gt; Another such author was poet [[Elena Farago]], whose didactic children's story ''Într-un cuib de rândunică'' ("Inside a Swallow's Nest") borrows from "The Flax and the Shirt".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;705&lt;/ref&gt;

With the interwar period and the spread of [[modernist literature]], a new generation of critics, most notably George Călinescu and [[Vladimir Streinu]], dedicated important segments of their activity to the works of Ion Creangă.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;238&lt;/ref&gt; Other such figures were [[Șerban Cioculescu]], whose contribution attempts to elucidate the more mysterious parts of the writer's vocabulary,&lt;ref name="gudecemb"/&gt; and educator Dumitru Furtună, whose biographical studies provided a main source for subsequent research.&lt;ref name="csmarturii"/&gt; By then, interest in Creangă's life and writings had diversified. This phenomenon first touched [[Theatre of Romania|Romanian theater]] when [[I. I. Mironescu]] dramatized a section of Creangă's ''Memories'' as ''Catiheții de la Humulești'' ("The Catechists from Humulești")—a literary contribution judged "superfluous" by George Călinescu, who noted that the original was already "dramatic" in style.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;785&lt;/ref&gt; The writer's stories also became an inspiration for [[Alfred Mendelsohn]] and [[Alexandru Zirra]], two Romanian composers who worked in children's [[musical theater]], who adapted, respectively, "[[Harap Alb]]" and "[[The Goat and Her Three Kids]]".&lt;ref&gt;Viorel Cosma, [http://www.icr.ro/bucharest/tales-of-two-reigns-children-and-childhood-30-2007/from-the-musical-folklore-of-children-to-the-comic-opera-for-children.html "From the Musical Folklore of Children to the Comic Opera for Children"], in ''Plural Magazine'', Nr. 30/2007&lt;/ref&gt; Creangă was also a secondary presence in ''Mite'' and ''Bălăuca'', two biographical novels centered on Eminescu's amorous life, written by the prominent interwar critic [[Eugen Lovinescu]], to whom Călinescu reproached having largely ignored Creangă in his nonfictional texts.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.&amp;nbsp;801, 807&lt;/ref&gt; Creangă's writings also earned followers among the more radical wing of the modernist scene. The authenticity and originality of Creangă's prose were highlighted and treasured by the influential modernist venue ''[[Contimporanul]]'', in particular by its literary chroniclers [[Ion Vinea]] and [[Benjamin Fondane]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.&amp;nbsp;76, 143, 200–201&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, while formally affiliating with [[Surrealism]], the [[avant-garde]] author [[Ion Călugăru]] contributed various prose works which borrow some of Creangă's storytelling techniques to depict the lives of [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish Romanian]] communities from Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.&amp;nbsp;76, 143&lt;/ref&gt;

In stages after [[World War I]], the 19th century writer became better known to an international audience. This process produced translations into English, some of which, Călinescu argued, reached significant popularity among [[United Kingdom|British]] readers of Romanian literature.&lt;ref name="gc975"/&gt; In contrast, writer [[Paul Bailey (British writer)|Paul Bailey]] assessed that the variants used antiquated words and "sounded terrible" in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Marius Chivu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/index.php?nr=110&amp;cmd=articol&amp;id=998 " 'O, țară tristă, plină de humor! De asta iubesc România' " (interview with Paul Bailey)], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Vol. III, Nr. 110, March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Among the series of early English-language versions was a 1920 edition of Creangă's ''Memories'', translated by Lucy Byng and published by Marcu Beza.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icr.ro/bucuresti/art-recollections-21-2004/marcu-beza.html "Marcu Beza"], in ''Plural Magazine'', Nr. 21/2004&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during the interwar that [[Jean Boutière]] published the first-ever [[French-language]] [[monograph]] on the Romanian writer, originally as a [[Ph.D.]] thesis for the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref name="csmarturii"/&gt;

While their author continued to receive praise for his main contributions, the erotic tales were most often kept hidden from the public eye. George Călinescu summarized this contrast by stating: "The 'corrosives' left by Creangă are not known publicly."&lt;ref name="gc488"/&gt; An exception to this rule was Kirileanu's Creangă reader of 1938, published by [[Editura Fundațiilor Regale]] as the first critical edition of his entire literature.&lt;ref name="tvii213"/&gt; According to critic Adrian Solomon, the Romanian tradition of silencing [[Romanian profanity|obscene language]] and sexually explicit literature through [[censorship]] made "The Tale of All Tales" circulate "rather like a [[samizdat]]", which left writers with "no solid tradition to draw on, and precious little chance to evade&amp;nbsp;... the vigilant morals of a straitlaced public."&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Solomon, [http://www.icr.ro/bucharest/eromania-26-2005/loosening-the-lace.html "Loosening the Lace"], in ''Plural Magazine'', Nr. 26/2005&lt;/ref&gt; The nationalist aspects of Ion Creangă's public discourse were however approved of and recovered by the [[far right]] of the 1920s and '30s. High-ranking Orthodox cleric [[Tit Simedrea]] referred to Creangă as a predecessor when, in 1937, he urged his congregation to refrain from purchasing merchandise sold by Jews (a measure which he believed was a practical alternative to the Jews' forced eviction).&lt;ref name="ao140"/&gt; In 1939, as part of a press campaign targeting Călinescu's work, the [[Fascism|fascist]] journal ''[[Porunca Vremii]]'' accused the literary historian of having exposed Creangă's biography for the sake of compromising the "genial Moldavian" by turning him into "an unfrocked epileptic and a drunk."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;443&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under communism===
[[File:Ion Creanga bust.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Lev Averbruh]]'s bust of Ion Creangă ([[Alley of Classics, Chișinău|Alley of Classics]], [[Chișinău]])]]
During Romania's restrictive [[communist Romania|communist period]], which lasted between 1948 and 1989, the critical evaluation of Ion Creangă's work went through several periods, complementing political developments. Throughout the first part of this interval, when [[Socialist realism in Romania|socialist realism]] was politically imposed on Romanian letters, Creangă was spared the posthumous censorship which affected several other classical writers (''see [[Censorship in Communist Romania]]''). His work was officially praised for its aesthetic qualities, but its association with the condemned ''Junimea'' was omitted from critical commentary, and readers were instead referred to Creangă as a realist critical of [[bourgeois]] society.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120218133857/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/images/articole/simut27.pdf "Canonul literar proletcultist"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 27/2008 (republished by ''România Culturală'')&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the new authorities granted him posthumous membership in the [[Romanian Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.acad.ro/membri_ar/pag_membri_pm.htm ''Membrii post-mortem al Academiei Române''], at the [[Romanian Academy]] site&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, at the height of [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]], official critic [[Barbu Lăzăreanu]] controversially described Creangă as a writer indebted to [[Russian folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/nimeni_nu_poate_sri_peste_umbra_epocii_lui "Nimeni nu poate sări peste umbra epocii lui"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804111228/http://www.romlit.ro/nimeni_nu_poate_sri_peste_umbra_epocii_lui |date=2012-08-04 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 23/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second half of communist rule, several new approaches in the critical assessment of Creangă's literature were emerging. His work became a main topic of critical interest and the sole subject of many works, to the point where [[Nicolae Manolescu]] assessed that "everything has been said about Creangă".&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;199–200&lt;/ref&gt; Within this exegetic phenomenon, an original interpretation of his stories from an [[Esotericism|esoteric]] perspective was written by philosopher [[Vasile Lovinescu]] as ''Creangă și Creanga de aur'' ("Creangă and the Golden Bough").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Iulian Băicuș, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090305233448/http://www.contrafort.md/2006/145-146/1139.html "Despre mitocritică, mitanaliză, arhetipuri și alți demoni critici" (III)], in ''[[Contrafort]]'', Nr. 11-12/2006&lt;/ref&gt; During the final two decades of communism, under [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], the recovery of nationalist discourse into official dogma also encouraged the birth of [[Protochronism]]. In one of its aspects, theorized by cultural historian [[Edgar Papu]], this approach controversially reevaluated various Romanian writers, Creangă included, presenting them as figures who anticipated most developments on the world stage.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;79–81; Mihăilescu, pp.&amp;nbsp;149, 153, 158, 171&lt;/ref&gt; Papu's own conclusion about "[[Harap Alb]]", outlined in a 1983 volume, depicted Creangă as a direct predecessor of [[Italy|Italian]] [[Semiotics|semiotician]] [[Umberto Eco]] and his celebrated volume ''[[The Open Work]]''—a conclusion which literary historian Florin Mihăilescu has seen as proof of Papu's "exegetic obsession", lacking in "sense of humor, not just sense of reality."&lt;ref&gt;Mihăilescu, p.&amp;nbsp;158&lt;/ref&gt; One of Papu's disciples, [[National communism|national communist]] ideologue [[Dan Zamfirescu]], claimed that Creangă was equal to, or even more important than world classics [[Homer]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], while asserting that the eponymous protagonist of "[[Ivan Turbincă]]" stands as "the character who dominates world history in our century".&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;80&lt;/ref&gt; Left outside the scope of this critical interest, the "corrosives" were left out of new Creangă readers (such as [[Iorgu Iordan]]'s 1970 edition), being, according to a 1976 essay by scholar George Munteanu, "still unpublishable" for lack of "a general level of aesthetic education" among Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;Braga, p.&amp;nbsp;199&lt;/ref&gt;

The series also includes [[Nicolae Mărgineanu]]'s biographical film of 1989, ''[[Un bulgăre de humă]]'', focuses on the friendship between Creangă (played by [[Dorel Vișan]]) and Eminescu ([[Adrian Pintea]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Gabriela Lupu, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120509205742/http://old.cotidianul.ro/adrian_pintea_un_actor_extraordinar_si_un_profesor_desavirsit-27446.html "Adrian Pintea, un actor extraordinar și un profesor desavîrșit"], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', June 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of Ion Creangă was also tangible in the [[Soviet Union]], and especially in the [[Moldavian SSR]] (which, as the larger section of [[Bessarabia]], had been part of interwar [[Greater Romania]], and later became independent [[Moldova]]).

[[File:Ion Creanga 2014 Romanian stamp.jpg|thumb|Creangă on a 2014 Romanian stamp]]
After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], which signaled the end of communism, Creangă's work was subject to rediscovery and reevaluation. This implied the publishing of his "corrosives", most notably in a 1998 edition titled ''Povestea poveștilor generației '80'' ("The Tale of the Tales of the 80s Generation"). Edited by [[Dan Petrescu (writer)|Dan Petrescu]] and [[Luca Pițu]], it featured a Postmodern reworking of ''Povestea poveștilor'' by [[Mircea Nedelciu]], a leading theorist of the ''[[Optzeciști]]'' writers.&lt;ref name="astalent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Povestea-povestilor&amp;nbsp;... *articleID_5796-articles_details.html "Povestea poveștilor&amp;nbsp;..."], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 20, July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; A trilingual edition of Creangă's original text was published in 2006 as a [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]] project, with illustrations made for the occasion by graphic artist [[Ioan Iacob]].&lt;ref name="glliiceanu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Gabriela Lupu, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100418180124/http://cotidianul.ro/liiceanu_scoate_povestea_povestilor_de_creanga_la_export-19680.html "Liiceanu scoate ''Povestea Poveștilor'' de Creangă la export"], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', December 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The book included versions of the text in English (the work of Alistair Ian Blyth) and French (translated by Marie-France Ionesco, the daughter of playwright [[Eugène Ionesco]]), both of which were noted for resorting exclusively to antiquated slang.&lt;ref name="glliiceanu"/&gt; In 2004, another one of Creangă's stories was subjected to a Postmodern interpretation, with [[Stelian Țurlea]]'s novel ''Relatare despre Harap Alb'' ("A Report about Harap Alb").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Tudorel Urian, [http://www.romlit.ro/harap_alb_reloaded "''Harap Alb'' reloaded"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr.3/2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Țurlea followed up with a version of "[[The Old Man's Daughter and the Old Woman's Daughter]]";&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Horia Gârbea]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120224011937/http://www.sfin.ro/articol_15984/fata_babei_si_fata_%E2%80%9Emosului%E2%80%9C_-_autor_inca_tanar.html "Fata babei și fata 'moșului'-autor încă tânăr!"], in ''[[Săptămâna Financiară]]'', April 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; a year later, his colleague [[Horia Gârbea]] published a personal take on "The Story of a Lazy Man".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Terian]], [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/fratele-mai-destept-al-lui-kalasnikov-6139593 "''Fratele mai deștept al lui Kalașnikov''"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', May 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Ion Creangă's own didactic tales have remained a presence in the [[Education in Romania|Romanian curriculum]] after 2000, particularly in areas of education targeting the youngest students.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cristina Lazurca, [http://www.glsa.ro/informatii/cultura_religie/42225-lectura_placere_sau_supliciu.html "Lectura—plăcere sau supliciu?"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''[[Glasul Aradului]]'', March 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, answering a petition signed by a group of cultural personalities from Iași, [[Patriarch Daniel of Romania|Metropolitan Daniel]] (the future [[Patriarch of All Romania]]) signed a decision to posthumously revert the decision to exclude Ion Creangă from among the Moldavian clergy.&lt;ref name="ccpreotia"/&gt; The public polled during a 2006 program produced by the [[Romanian Television]] nominated Creangă 43rd among the [[100 greatest Romanians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.mariromani.ro/top100.php "Top 100"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023063242/http://www.mariromani.ro/top100.php |date=2006-10-23 }}, at the [[Romanian Television]]'s [http://www.mariromani.ro/ ''Mari Români'' site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220111019/http://www.mariromani.ro/ |date=2008-02-20 }}; retrieved August 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; New monuments honoring the writer include a bust unveiled in Târgu Neamț, the work of sculptor Ovidiu Ciobotaru.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Gina Popa, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120222052156/http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/un-tinar-artist-cu.html "Un tînar artist, cu un palmares impresionant"], in ''[[Evenimentul]]'', September 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The patrimony associated with Creangă's life has also sparked debates: local authorities in Târgu Neamț were criticized for not maintaining the site near his house in its best condition,&lt;ref name="frbiju"/&gt; while the [[Fălticeni]] where he once lived was controversially put up for sale by its private owners in 2009, at a time when city hall could not exercise its [[pre-emption right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Dan Pricope, [http://www.romanialibera.ro/a144192/casa-lui-creanga-scoasa-la-vanzare.html "Casa lui Creangă scoasă la vânzare"], in ''[[România Liberă]]'', January 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Creangă's name was assigned to several education institutions, among them Bucharest's [[Ion Creangă National College]], and to an annual prize granted by the Romanian Academy. There is a [[Ion Creangă, Neamț|Ion Creangă]] [[Commune in Romania|commune]], in [[Neamț County]], and streets or squares were also named in the writer's honor in cities throughout Romania: Târgu Neamț, Iași, Fălticeni, Bucharest, [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], [[Brăila]], [[Brașov]], [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Craiova]], [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin]], [[Oradea]], [[Ploiești]], [[Sibiu]], [[Suceava]], [[Târgu Mureș]], [[Tecuci]], [[Timișoara]], [[Tulcea]], etc. A quarter in northern Bucharest, near [[Colentina, Bucharest|Colentina]], is also named ''Ion Creangă''. Creangă's name was assigned to several landmarks and institutions in post-Soviet Moldova. Among them is the [[Ion Creangă Pedagogical State University]], founded on the basis of Chișinău's [[normal school]].

The '''Karasu relief''', also known as the '''Süpürgüç relief''' after the earlier name of the nearby town of [[Akbudak]], is a [[rock relief]] located on a tributary of the [[Euphrates]] and derives from the [[Syro-Hittite states|Neo-Hittite period]]. It depicts a protective god standing on a deer.  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]]. 

== Location and discovery ==
[[File:Karasu3.jpg|thumb|Location high above the river]]
[[File:Karasu1.jpg|thumb|vertical]]
The relief is located near the town of Gümüşpınar near Akbudak in the district of [[Araban]], [[Gaziantep Province]], [[Turkey]], on a cliff-face about 200 m above the [[Karasu river]], about three km from where it meets the [[Euphrates]]. Here the river has dug a deep gorge in the limestone of the ''Kartal Dağı''. A few metres below the top of the cliff is the relief on the east side of a rectangular outcrop. In the early first millennium BC the border between the [[Iron Age]] kingdoms of [[Kummuh]] (later [[Commagene]])  and [[Carchemish]] was located in the area. From the inscription on the late [[Assyria]]n relief at Kenk Boğazı, ten kilometres away, it appears that both reliefs were located within the kingdom of Kummuh.

The relief was discovered by geologists Krummanacher and Wilson in 1956 and first published by [[Charles Burney]] and G.R. Lawson in 1958.

== Description ==
The relief is 1.98 m high by 1.6 m wide. It shows a warrior standing on a deer. The deer is 1.2 m high, its back is 52 cm high and the body is 68 cm long. It faces left, with its head held high on a slender neck. The head with a slightly opened mouth is depicted in profile. A finely carved pair of antlers with two branches on each side is depicted front-on on top of the head. According to [[Frank Starke]] it is a [[red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus'').

On the back of the dear, there is a 1.2 m high male figure facing left and wearing a short kilt and shoes. He is armed with a spear in his right hand and holds a bow over his shoulder with his left hand. In 1976, the upper part of the cliff was blown away with dynamite by treasure hunters. Since then none of the head is visible except for the beard. On old illustrations show details of the face and the hair hanging down his neck. The wears the tall, round-topped hat of a god. A Sun symbol hovers above the figure. Although there is no inscription on the relief, the figure with the deer is clearly the protective god of the wild, [[Kurunta (god)|Kurunta or Tuntija]]. The motif of the "god on the deer" is already known attested at Assyrian trade outposts and the [[Hittite empire]] at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. In late Hittite times the motif is found on, for example, the [[Hacıbebekli stele]]. Inspection revealed traces of a late Hittite settlement in the area, which suggests that the relief depicts a protective god of the settlement.

[[Hansgerd Hellenkemper]] and Jörg Wagner assigned the work to the "traditional style" (1050-850 BC) on the basis of stylistic elements, while [[Winfried Orthmann]] dated it to the "Late Hittite II" period (950-850 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Winfried Orthmann: ''Untersuchungen zur späthethitischen Kunst.'' (=''Saarbrücker Beiträge zur Altertumskunde'' Vol. 8) Habelt, Bonn 1971, {{ISBN|978-3774911222}}, p.&amp;nbsp;487.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bridge ==
[[File:KarasuKöprüsü.jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge]]
About two kilometres upstream are the remains of a Roman bridge at Karasu, known in Turkish as Karasu Köprüsü. It was part of the military road which led from [[Zeugma, Commagene|Zeugma]] to [[Samosata]] and was located south of the [[Monumental graves at Elif, Hisar und Hasanoğlu]]. From the bridge it is about forty-five minutes walk up the plateau to the relief.

==Rally==
In June 1996 a branch of the Ku Klux Klan announced plans to hold a rally in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mich. woman aids man being beaten|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/290785877.html?FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun%2025,%201996&amp;author=AP&amp;pub=Boston%20Globe%20(pre-1997%20Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Mich.%20woman%20aids%20man%20being%20beaten|accessdate=October 30, 2013|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=June 25, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several people in the Ann Arbor area planned to hold a protest against the Ku Klux Klan's presence on the day of the rally. Thomas was one of several people that attended and protested from an area that had been fenced and set aside for the protesters.&lt;ref name="TA"&gt;{{cite news|last=Paine|first=Chris|title=Why black teenager Keshia Thomas saved a white supremacist|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/why-black-teenager-keshia-thomas-saved-a-white-supremacist/story-e6frg6n6-1226749697993|accessdate=October 30, 2013|newspaper=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protest proceeded until one protester announced over a megaphone that there was "a Klansman in the crowd".&lt;ref name="TA"/&gt; The unnamed man was a middle-aged white male wearing a T-shirt depicting the [[Confederate flag]] and an "SS tattoo".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wynne|first=Catherine|title=The teenager who saved a man with an SS tattoo|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24653643|accessdate=October 30, 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man began to run but was knocked down, kicked, and beaten with [[placards]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

Thomas, who was at that time 18 years old, shielded the man from the crowd and shouted for the attackers to stop and is credited as saying that you "can't beat goodness into a person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gillette|first1=Ethel|title=As Thanksgiving Day approaches, there is much to be thankful about |newspaper=The Tampa Tribune |date=November 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after that point the police arrived on the scene.&lt;ref name="HDE"&gt;{{cite news|title=Teen Who Saved Man At Klan Rally Wanted to Stop Mob Attack|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fk9BAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4qgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4988,2510165&amp;dq=keshia-thomas&amp;hl=en|accessdate=October 30, 2013|newspaper=Harlan Daily Enterprise|date=June 25, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A news report stated that seven anti-Klansmen protesters were arrested at the event and a large group of protesters were [[tear gas]]sed after they attempted to enter the police station where fifteen Klansmen were being kept for their safety.&lt;ref name="HDE"/&gt; The police later reported that the man was not a Klan member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guardian Angel|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20141729,00.html|accessdate=October 30, 2013|newspaper=People magazine|date=July 8, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the rally Thomas was praised for her actions by Senator [[Ernest Hollings]] and a reporter for ''The Day'' commented that while the man was "wrong for the views he sanctioned", the protesters were also in the wrong "in their violence against him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alone in the Mob|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vw1HAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JvgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4178,1693389&amp;dq=keshia-thomas&amp;hl=en|accessdate=October 30, 2013|newspaper=The Day|date=July 11, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hollings|first1=Ernest F.|title=KESHIA THOMAS: LEADING BY EXAMPLE|url=http://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t17.d18.c4b088c70e001e9a?accountid=10559|accessdate=February 21, 2016|issue=Vol. 142 No. 97 Pg. S7204|publisher=Congressional Record Daily Edition (subscription required)|date=June 27, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas expressed that she had protected the man due to her own religious convictions and because she "knew what it was like to be hurt ... The many times that that happened, I wish someone would have stood up for me." A few months after the June event, Thomas was thanked by the son of the unnamed man she rescued.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

'''Laurel Caverns''', is the deepest [[cave]] in the northeastern United States and the largest in volume{{cn|date=March 2018}}. Located in [[Farmington, Pennsylvania]], it sits on Chestnut Ridge near [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania|Uniontown]], about {{convert|50|mi|km}} southeast of [[Pittsburgh]]. 

It is a privately owned [[show cave]] with a three-hour-long guided tour penetrating 46 stories deep into the mountain interior. It is within a calcareous sandstone &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laurelcaverns.com/ Official Laurel Caverns website]&lt;/ref&gt;made up of 70% [[silica]] grains cemented together with 30% [[calcium carbonate]] and a small amount of iron oxide. The cave formed when the calcium  carbonate was dissolved by [[groundwater]] allowing the silica to be washed away. This gives the cave rough walls, a sandy floor, and very few formations normally seen in the more common high calcium limestone caves. Laurel Caverns was also formed in an area of [[Fold (geology)|fold]]ed and [[fracture]]d rock.  Because of this, the entire cave is tilted thirteen degrees, resulting in many steep passageways. They tend to follow the fractures in the rock, resulting in a grid of long passageways.
[[Image:laurelcaverns.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Narrow section of a portion of the cave that can be viewed on the standard tour.]]

The cave has been known since the 18th century, and probably used by the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] long before that{{cn|date=March 2018}}. It was home to about 25,000 bats before the advent of [[white-nose syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.com/veilofthevalley/the-story-devastated-bat-population-means-more-pests-in-beaver/article_a58e360e-cd7b-11e2-afe5-0019bb30f31a.html|title=Devastated bat population means more pests in Beaver County|newspaper=The Beaver County Times|publicationdate=June 4, 2013|publisher=Calkins Media Incorporated|publication-place=Bucks County, Pennsylvania|quote="The cavern has lost nearly all of a population that used to number 25,000 bats."|first1=Evan|last1= Witek|first2= Amanda|last2= King}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stays at a temperature of 12°C (52°F) year round.

The steep slope of some passageways causes an [[optical illusion]] known as a [[gravity hill]].  The illusion of a ball rolling uphill is an illustration of this effect.

'''Lionel John Alexander Monckton''' (18 December 1861 – 15 February 1924) was an English writer and composer of musical theatre.  He became Britain's most popular composer of [[Edwardian musical comedy]] in the early years of the 20th century.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Monckton was born in London, the eldest son of the Town Clerk of London, Sir [[John Monckton (town clerk)|John Braddick Monckton]], and Lady Monckton, the former Maria Louisa Long (1837–1920), an "enthusiastic amateur actress".&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Gänzl, Kurt.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39395 "Monckton, (John) Lionel Alexander (1861–1924)", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press (2004)], accessed 16 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1240 "Monckton, Lady (Maria Louisa)"], ''Who's Who'' (1907), Vol. 59, p. 1240, A. &amp; C. Black&lt;/ref&gt; His sister was Mrs Augusta Moore, who wrote popular novels as Martin J. Pritchard.

[[File:Shopgirl1.jpg|right|thumb|upright|1st anniversary souvenir]]
He was educated at [[Charterhouse School]] and [[Oriel College]] at [[Oxford University]], graduating in 1885.  There he acted in college theatrical productions and composed music for productions of the Oxford University Dramatic Society, of which he was a founder, and the Phil-Thespian Club.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'' obituary, 16 February 1924, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; He initially joined the legal profession at [[Lincoln's Inn]] and began to practise law, but gained part-time work as a songwriter and a theatre and music critic, first for the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' and later for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''.  His first theatre work was ''Mummies and Marriage'', an operetta produced by amateurs in 1888.  At the age of 29, in 1891, he finally managed to place the song "What will you have to Drink?", with lyrics by [[Basil Hood]], in a professional [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]] called ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]''.  After this, his songs were included in several other London shows.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Contributor to musicals===
Monckton soon became a regular composer (and sometimes lyricist) of songs for the very successful series of frothy [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedies]] performed at London's [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], under the management of [[George Edwardes]], which premiered throughout the 1890s and into the first decade of the 20th Century.  Among others, he wrote half of the music for [[Arthur Roberts (comedian)|Arthur Roberts]]'s burlesque ''Claude Du-Val'' (1894) and supplemented [[Ivan Caryll]]'s score for the hit musical ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' in the same year, with such successful pieces as [[George Grossmith, Jr.]]'s "Beautiful Bountiful Bertie" and "Brown of Colorado" (with [[Adrian Ross]]).  He then added popular tunes to Caryll's scores for ''[[The Circus Girl]]'' in 1896 ("A Little Bit of String" and "The Way to Treat a Lady") and ''[[A Runaway Girl]]'' in 1898 ("Soldiers in the Park", "Society", "The Sly Cigarette", "The Boy Guessed Right" and "Not the Sort of Girl I Care About").&lt;ref name=BMT&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/british/composers/monckton.html "Lionel Monckton"], ''British Musical Theatre'', The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 31 August 2004, retrieved 5 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moncktons.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Monckton and wife [[Gertie Millar|Millar]]]]
The "Girl" musicals were followed by a number of "Boy" musicals, again with hit songs by Monckton, including ''[[The Messenger Boy]]'' in 1900 ("Maisie", "In the Wash", and "When the Boys Come Home Once More") and ''[[The Toreador]]'' in 1901 ("Captivating Cora", "I'm Romantic", "When I Marry Amelia", "Keep Off the Grass", and "Archie").  Monckton's songs continued to be performed long after the shows closed – some of them remaining popular into the 1960s.&lt;ref name=BMT/&gt; In 1902, he married [[Gertie Millar]], one of the most successful actresses of the period, whom he had discovered and brought to Edwardes.  She starred in many of Monckton's shows, and he wrote some of his most popular songs for her, although their marriage was not a happy one for many years.  She later sought a divorce from Monckton, which he refused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-fourgr.html Article claiming that Millar was estranged from Monckton as early as 1905]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Monckton also contributed songs for the musicals playing at Edwardes's [[Daly's Theatre]], which tended more towards romantic comedies, than the light musicals presented at the Gaiety.  For Daly's Theatre, he usually collaborated with [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]], supplying numbers for hits such as ''[[The Geisha]]'' in 1896 ("Jack's the Boy" and "The Toy Monkey"); ''[[A Greek Slave]]'' in 1898 ("I Want to Be Popular", "I Should Rather Like to Try", and "What Will Be the End of It?"); and ''[[San Toy]]'' in 1899 ("Rhoda and Her Pagoda", and "Sons of the Motherland").  Monckton's music was generally arranged and orchestrated by theatre conductor [[Carl Kiefert]].&lt;ref name=BMT/&gt;

===Peak years===
[[File:Phyllis dare The Arcadians.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Phyllis Dare|Dare]] in ''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]'']]
Finally, in 1902, when Jones left Daly's, Edwardes gave Monckton the opportunity to compose his first complete score, ''[[A Country Girl]]'', with a few numbers by [[Paul Rubens (composer)|Paul Rubens]] (Monckton's key songs were "Molly the Marchioness", "Try Again, Johnny", and "Under the Deodar").  He also continued to contribute successful songs to other musicals, including ''[[The Orchid]]'' in 1903 at the Gaiety ("Liza Ann", "Little Mary", "Pushful", and "Fancy Dress").  The success of ''A Country Girl'' led to another musical with Monckton as principal composer and Rubens as contributor, ''[[The Cingalee]]'' in 1904.  Monckton's most successful songs in this score included "The Island of Gay Ceylon" and "Pearl of Sweet Ceylon".  Although the piece was successful, French operettas then became the fashion at Daly's Theatre, and Monckton went back to composing music for others' shows.&lt;ref name=BMT/&gt;

Further collaborations with Caryll at the Gaiety included ''[[The Spring Chicken]]'' in 1905 ("I Don't Know, But I Guess", "Alice Sat By the Fire", and "Under and Over Forty"), ''[[The New Aladdin]]'', in 1906 and ''[[The Girls of Gottenberg]]'' in 1907 ("Two Little Sausages", "Rheingold", and "Berlin on the Spree").  These songs were among the most widely played and sung numbers of the contemporary light musical theatre.  A last success at the Gaiety was Monckton and Caryll's ''[[Our Miss Gibbs]]'' in 1909 ("Moonstruck", "Mary", "In Yorkshire", "Soldiers in the Park", "Maisie", "Keep off the Grass" and "Our Farm"), which became an international hit.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

After that, Monckton had his greatest success, in collaboration with [[Howard Talbot]] and the lyricist Arthur Wimperis, with ''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]'', in 1909.  ''The Arcadians'', produced by [[Robert Courtneidge]], was possibly Monckton's best score and is considered the classic musical of the [[Edwardian period]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/fraser.charlton/edmuscom/page12/edmuscom_what.html Article describing ''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]'' as the masterpiece of [[Edwardian musical comedy]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''The Geisha'', ''A Country Girl'' and ''Our Miss Gibbs'', it became popular in America and elsewhere and included songs such as "The Pipes of Pan", "The Girl with the Brogue", and "All Down Piccadilly", which "held their own with the melodies of the now fashionable Viennese operetta as the song hits of the period."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

[[File:Theboysong.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Music from ''[[The Boy (musical)|The Boy]]'']]
Edwardes purchased the lease of the [[Adelphi Theatre]] and began his productions there with another Monckton and Millar hit, ''[[The Quaker Girl]]'', in 1910 ("The Quaker Girl", "Come to the Ball", and "Tony from America").  For Courtneidge, he wrote ''The Mousmé'' in 1911 ("I Know Nothing of Life", "The Little Japanese Mamma", "The Temple Bell", and "The Corner of My Eye") and for Edwardes and the Adelphi, he wrote ''[[The Dancing Mistress]]'' in 1912.  The latter two pieces had merely respectable runs.  Monckton's last big hit was ''[[The Boy (musical)|The Boy]]'' in 1917 (produced after Edwardes's death), in collaboration with [[Howard Talbot]].  This was a musical comedy version of [[Arthur Wing Pinero]]'s 1885 play, ''The Magistrate'', and served as a vehicle for the comedian W. H. Berry, who had been the star of ''High Jinks''.  Monckton's successful songs included "I Want to Go to Bye-Bye", "The Game That Ends with a Kiss", and "Powder on Your Nose".&lt;ref name=BMT/&gt;

===After World War I===
Monckton was discouraged by Edwardes's death and unwilling to adapt his style of writing to the newly popular [[Syncopation|syncopated]] American dance rhythms, [[ragtime]], and other "noisy numbers" that were heard in theatres.  Although he contributed to some [[revue]]s, including ''Bric à Brac'' (1915, including another song for Millar: "Chalk Farm to Camberwell Green"), ''We're All in it'', and ''Airs and Graces'', he had little enthusiasm for this, or for other new forms of musical entertainment, and he soon retired from composing.&lt;ref name=BMT/&gt;  Monckton's music remained popular in Britain until after [[World War II]], when American musicals took over the stage&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/composer_page.asp?name=monckton Profile of Monckton at the Hyperion site]&lt;/ref&gt; and even into the later half of the 20th century, in the case of his most popular shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/garlands/107.htm Information about Monckton shows from Classical Music Web]&lt;/ref&gt;

Monckton died in his home in London at the age of 62 and is buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brompton.org/Residents.htm Brompton Cemetery website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823091118/http://www.brompton.org/Residents.htm |date=23 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monckton left an estate valued at £79,518&lt;ref&gt;Will probated 16 April 1924, CGPLA Eng. &amp; Wales&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year, his widow remarried [[William Humble Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley]], becoming the Countess of Dudley.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12370">A '''little Switzerland''' or '''''Schweiz''''' is a [[landscape]], often of wooded hills. This [[Romanticism|Romantic]] aesthetic term is not a geographic category, but was widely used in the 19th century to connote dramatic natural scenic features that would be of interest to tourists. Since it was ambiguous from the very beginning, it was flexibly used in travel writing to imply that a landscape had some features, though on a much smaller scale, that might remind a visitor of [[Switzerland]].

== Rock outcrops ==
[[Image:Bastei - Die Bastei vom Elbe-Aussichtspunkt.jpg|thumb|The [[Bastei]], [[Saxon Switzerland]]]]
[[Image:Rochedoetre.jpg|thumb|[[Rock of Oëtre]], [[Norman Switzerland]]]]

The original generic term was applied to dozens of locations in Europe, the bulk of them German-speaking, as well as to other parts of the world, to direct attention to rock outcrops that stand out, usually amid steep forest. The original, 18th-century comparison was usually with the fissured crags of the [[Jura Mountains]] on the Franco-Swiss border which hardly rise higher than 1700 metres. 

Histories of [[Saxon Switzerland]] (''Sächsische Schweiz'') in Saxony, Germany, assert that the landscape description ''schweiz'' arose there at the end of the 18th century. ''Schweiz'' is the German-language name of Switzerland. The term was used both alone and with the prefix "little", for example in the title of an 1820 German book-length poem, ''Die kleine Schweiz'' by Jakob Reiselsberger,&lt;ref&gt;Reiselsberger, Jakob; Die kleine Schweiz oder Einladung zur Reise nach Streitberg, Muggendorf, Weischenfeld [et]c. und deren Umgebungen; Leitfaden für hieher Reisende, Höhlen-Besucher, Natur- und Alterthums-Freunde, und schön unterhaltendes Taschenbuch für jedermann; [S.l.] 1820&lt;/ref&gt; which praised the rocky scenery of a part of [[Franconia]] in Germany known thereafter as the [[Franconian Switzerland]] (''Fränkische Schweiz'').

The term was already colloquial by this time in English: in 1823 a correspondent asserted in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' that a steep area by the road outside [[Petersfield, Hampshire|Petersfield]] in southern England was a little Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gentleman's Magazine'', London; December 1823, page 506&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic term, to describe picturesque exposed rock and steepness rather than altitude, was also in common use in other European languages, including the French term ''Suisse''. Rocks and wild landscapes were a favoured theme in [[Romanticism|Romantic]] painting.

The many English places praised in 19th-century promotional literature as "little Switzerland" include [[Church Stretton]], [[Whitfield, Northumberland|Whitfield]] and the coastal area around the [[North Devon]] twin towns of Lynton and [[Lynmouth]]. Chalet-style buildings were sometimes erected to emphasize little Switzerland pretensions, for example at [[Matlock Bath railway station|Matlock Bath]], which (unusually for England) also features a [[Aerial lift|cable car]].

== Mountains ==

From the beginning, the term was often understood as a comparison to the snow-capped Alps rather than to the Jura. The following passage, describing Wales, appears in an 1831 English-language edition of [[Conrad Malte-Brun|Malte-Brun's]] ''Universal Geography'', which had originally been written in French in 1803–07: 

{{cquote|The great number of mountains which diversify its surface have gained it the name of Little Switzerland. It will be readily understood that it is not in the loftiness of their summits this resemblance can be traced with the country of the Alps, but in their steep, rough and perpendicular sides, the depth of their narrow valleys, the small but limpid lakes which occur at every step, the great number of rivers and streams which are now precipitated in cascades, and now roll their waters slowly through the meadows, the damp fogs which rise from the surface of these waters and often hang about the summits of the highest mountains, and the snow which frequently continues upon the heights till the end of spring: all of which give to these mountains, notwithstanding their inconsiderable height ... an appearance resembling those lordly eminences mounting up to the clouds and bearing on their heads eternal snows.&lt;ref&gt;Malte-Brun, Conrad; Universal Geography: Or, a Description of All Parts of the World, on a New Plan; Boston, Lilly and Wait, 1831, volume 1, page 742&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Describing the Atlantic island of St Helena in ''A New Voyage Round the World'' (1823–26), [[Otto von Kotzebue]] and [[Johann Friedrich Eschscholtz]] were translated into English as writing: 

{{cquote|The environs of Sandy Bay would be a perfect little Switzerland, but that the glaciers are wanting to complete the resemblance. Scattered among the enormous masses of rock which lie confusedly heaped upon each other a frightful wilderness and most smilingly picturesque landscape alternately present their contrasted images.&lt;ref&gt;Kotzebue, Otto von and Johann Friedrich Eschscholtz; A New Voyage Round the World in the Years 1823, 24, 25, and 26; Colburn and Bentley, 1830, page 317&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the United States, the raw [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of New Hampshire, which were soon to be one of the definitive subjects of American Romantic [[White Mountain art|painting]], were termed a little Switzerland by travel writer Henry Tudor as early as 1832.&lt;ref&gt;Tudor, Henry; Narrative of a Tour in North America; London, James Duncan, 1834, page 390&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lakelands ==
[[Image:Plön Panorama Ploener See.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Plön]] in [[Holstein Switzerland]]]]

In the later 19th century, authors and tourism promoters would praise picture-postcard summer scenery of woods and low hills reflected in blue lakes as a little Switzerland or ''schweiz''. Whereas the earlier use had implied a landscape of dangers, this was a term for beauty. 

This usage, reflected today in the official geographical terms for the [[Holstein Switzerland]] (''Holsteinische Schweiz'') and [[Mecklenburgische Schweiz|Mecklenburg Switzerland]] (''Mecklenburgische Schweiz'') in Germany, where there are neither mountains nor outcrops, is difficult to account for, but may refer to prestigious Swiss lakeside tourist destinations such as Zurich, Lucerne or [[Interlaken]] or to Lakes Geneva and Constance.

== Official names ==

The term has often appeared anachronistic since travel to Switzerland became affordable. By the 21st century, it was common for observers to express puzzlement that the "little Switzerland" label applied at all to regions such as the Suisse Normande, or to the Holstein Switzerland where the flat hilltops are no more than 150 metres above the lake surfaces.

In 1992, the Swiss Tourism Federation counted&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraenkische-schweiz.com/info/hintergrund/name_fs_entstehung.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019142004/http://www.fraenkische-schweiz.com/info/hintergrund/name_fs_entstehung.htm |date=October 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; more than 190 places round the world that had at least for some period been named after Switzerland, either because of a fancied scenic resemblance, in jest or referring to a banking haven, political neutrality or habitation by Swiss emigrants. No fewer than 67 places in neighbouring Germany were said by the Federation to have adopted little Switzerland names. 

While the byname has fallen out of fashion in some places, it persists as the official geographical name for several administrative regions and national parks including (with dates of legal designation):

* [[Little Switzerland (Wisconsin)]] (a ski resort from 1941 onwards)

== Usage ==
In English, "Little Switzerland" is usually said without any definite article or additional adjective, but often with a genitive modifier if there are several little Switzerlands within one nation, e.g. North Carolina's Little Switzerland. In European languages where Switzerland proper takes a definite article, little Switzerlands do likewise. Their English names may echo the vernacular, being capitalized and modified to the English alphabet, sometimes taking an English definite article, e.g. the Saechsische Schweiz (''die Sächsische Schweiz'') and the Suisse Normande (''la Suisse normande''). English forms are also widespread, e.g. Holstein Switzerland (Dickinson, 1964),&lt;ref&gt;{{Dickinson's Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss Franconia (Michelin, 1993),&lt;ref&gt;''Germany, Michelin Tourist Guide'', 1st Edition, 1993, Clermont-Ferrand, p 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Franconian Switzerland (Fodor, 1962,&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Eugene; ''Fodor's Modern Guides: Germany'', MacGibbon &amp; Kee, 1962, The Hague, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; and Bolt, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Bolt, Rodney, ''Bavaria'', London, 2005, pp. 203-204, {{ISBN|1-86011-202-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:Loathly lady.jpg||thumb|The loathly lady in an illustration for Maud Isabel Ebbutt's ''Hero-Myths and Legends of the British Race'' (1910)]]

The '''loathly lady''' (Motif D732 in [[Aarne-Thompson tale-type|Stith Thompson's motif index]]), is a tale type commonly used in [[medieval literature]], most famously in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Wife of Bath's Tale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garry|first1=Jane|last2=El-Shamy|first2=Hasan|title=Archetypes and Motifs in Folklore and Literature|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2005|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cn6pWMverBIC&amp;pg=PA130|isbn=978-0-7656-2953-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motif is that of a woman who appears unattractive (ugly, ''loathly'') but undergoes a transformation upon being approached by a man in spite of her unattractiveness, becoming extremely desirable. It is then revealed that her ugliness was the result of a [[curse]] which was broken by the hero's action.

== Irish legend ==
The loathly lady can be found in ''The Adventures of the Sons of [[Eochaid Mugmedon]]'', in which [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]] proves himself the rightful [[High King of Ireland]] by embracing her, because she turns out to personify the sovereignty of the territory (and is therefore sometimes referred in scholarship as a '[[sovereignty goddess]]'). The motif can also be found in stories of the earlier high kings [[Lugaid Loígde]] and [[Conn of the Hundred Battles]].

=== Diarmuid ===
In the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]], [[Diarmuid Ua Duibhne]] was one of the most famous members of the [[Fianna]]. One freezing winter's night, the Loathly Lady brazenly entered the Fianna lodge, where the warriors had just gone to bed after a hunting expedition. Drenched to the bone, her sodden hair was snarled and knotted. Desperate for warmth and shelter, she knelt beside each warrior and demanded a blanket, beginning with their leader Fionn. Despite her rants and temper tantrums, the tired men only rolled over and ignored her in the hope that she would leave. Only young Diarmuid, whose bed was nearest to the fireplace, took pity on the wretched woman, giving her his bed and blanket. The Loathly Lady noticed Diarmuid's love spot and said that she had wandered the world alone for 7 years. Diarmuid reassured her and told her she could sleep all night and that he would protect her. Towards dawn, he became aware that she had become a beautiful young woman.

The next day, the Loathly Lady rewarded Diarmuid's kindness by offering him his greatest wish—a house overlooking the sea. Overjoyed, Diarmuid asked the woman to live with him. She agreed on one condition: He must promise never to mention how ugly she looked on the night they met. After 3 days together, Diarmuid grew restless. The Loathly Lady offered to watch his greyhound and her new pups while he went hunting. On three separate occasions, Diarmuid's friends, envious of his good luck, visited the lady and asked for one of the new pups. Each time, she honoured the request. Each time, Diarmuid was angry and asked her how she could repay him so meanly when he overlooked her ugliness the first night they met. On the third mention of that which he had promised never to speak of, the Loathly Lady and the house disappeared, and his beloved greyhound died.

Realizing that his ungratefulness has caused him to lose everything he valued, Diarmuid set out to find his lady. He used an enchanted ship to cross a stormy sea. Arriving in the Otherworld, he searched for the lady through green meadows filled with brightly coloured horses and silver trees. Three times he spied a drop of ruby-red blood and gathered each drop into his handkerchief. When a stranger revealed that the King's gravely ill daughter had just returned after 7 years, Diarmuid realised it must be his lady. Rushing to her side, he discovered she was dying. The 3 drops of blood Diarmuid collected were from her heart, spilled each time she thought of Diarmuid. The only cure was a cup of healing water from the Plain of Wonder, guarded by a jealous king and his army. Diarmuid vowed to bring back the cup.

His quest for the healing cup nearly ended at an impassable river. Diarmuid was stumped until the Red Man of All Knowledge, who had red hair and eyes like glowing coals, helped him cross the river and then guided him to the king of the healing cup's castle. Once there, Diarmuid issued a challenge and in response the king first sent out one thousand six hundred fighting men, then one thousand eight hundred. Diarmuid single-handedly slew them all.&lt;ref&gt;Gienna Matson．Celtic Mythology A to Z．New York：Chelsea House，2004：P.75&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed, the king gave him the cup of healing. On the return trip, the Red Man advised Diarmuid on how to heal his lady. He also warned the young hero that when her sickness ended, Diarmuid's love for her would end as well. Diarmuid refused to believe the prophecy, but indeed, it came true. The lady sadly understood that Diarmuid's love for her had died. She couldn't live in his world any more than he could live in hers. Diarmuid boarded an enchanted ship to return to the Fianna, where he was greeted by his friends and his greyhound, which the lady had returned to life as her final gift to him.

== Arthurian/British legend ==
In her capacity as a quest-bringer, the loathly lady can be found in the literature of the [[Holy Grail]], including [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'', [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]'', and the [[Welsh Romance]] ''[[Peredur, son of Efrawg]]'' associated with the ''[[Mabinogion]]''. The motif also appears in [[Wolfram von Eschenbac]]h's Middle High German romance ''[[Parzival]]'' in the character of Cundrie, the messenger of the Grail.

The theme became a staple of [[Arthurian]] literature; the best known treatment is in [[the Wife of Bath's Tale]], in which a knight, told that he can choose whether his bride is to be ugly yet faithful, or beautiful yet false, frees the lady from the form entirely by allowing her to choose for herself. A variation on this story is attached to [[Sir Gawain]] in the related romances ''[[The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle]]'' and ''[[The Marriage of Sir Gawain]]''. 

Another version of the motif is the [[ballad]] [[King Henry (song)|King Henry]]. In this ballad, the king must appease the loathly lady as she demands increasing tribute from him. The next morning, he is surprised as she transforms into a beautiful woman.

== Norse tradition ==
The loathly lady also appears in the [[Old Norse]] ''[[Hrólfr Kraki's saga]]'' where [[Hroðgar|Hróarr]]'s brother [[Halga|Helgi]]  was visited one [[Yule]] by an ugly being while he was in his hunting house. No person in the entire kingdom allowed the being to enter the house, except Helgi. Later, the thing asked to sleep in his bed. Unwillingly he agreed, and as the thing got into the bed, it turned into an [[Elf|elvish]] woman, who was clad in silk and who was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He raped her, and made her pregnant with a daughter named [[Skuld (princess)|Skuld]]. Helgi forgot the woman and a couple of days after the date had passed, he was visited by the woman, who had Skuld in her arms. The daughter would later marry [[Heoroweard|Hjörvarðr]], [[Hrólfr Kraki]]'s killer. This tradition is also present in the Northumbrian tale [[The Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh]]. Similar to this tale, is that of [[Hjálmþés saga ok Ölvis]].

== The Canterbury Tales: "The Wife of Bath's Tale" ==
The tale told by The Wife of Bath in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is one of the most prominent examples of the loathly lady motif. The story begins during the rule of King Arthur over the Isle of Britain.  It was a time when the people of the Isle of Britain were terrorized by friars who raped women.  Instead of getting the women pregnant like the incubus did in the past, the Friars solely brought shame upon them without impregnating them.  The plot of the story begins when a Knight of King Arthur's court rapes a young woman when he is overpowered by his lust for her.  The King and his court then come to the conclusion that decapitation is a punishment fit for the crime at hand, however the decision is intercepted by the Queen and women of the court before it can be executed.  The women persuade the King to grant him another chance on one condition.  They propose that if the Knight can find what women desire most from their partners and report it back to them in time, then the Knight will keep his head.  King Arthur then proceeds to accept the women's punishment and grants the knight this second chance.  The Knight quickly seizes this opportunity and sets out on a journey that becomes more difficult than he first anticipated.  Early in his quest the Knight comes to realize that each woman he questions seems to give him a different answer than the last.  As the Knight's time begins to run out, he comes across a group of young women dancing and sets out to question them as well.  But as the Knight draws near, to his dismay, the group vanishes and turns into a "loathly" old woman (a [[hag]]), who offers to help him with his dilemma.  The old woman joins the Knight on his quest back and aids him in giving the answer to the women of the court.  Together, the Knight and the Loathly Lady tell the women of the court that women desire sovereignty the most in their love life: women want to be treated as equal partners in their love relationships.  The Wife of Bath continues with her tale and says that the loathly woman asks the knight to marry her in return for helping him.  The knight submits to the hag's request although he pleads for her to take his material wealth instead.  They marry and consummate the marriage that very night.  When the old woman realizes how unhappy the Knight is she asks him why he is so sorrowful and he tells her that he is unhappy to have married such an unattractive wife.  The wife responds to this comment by giving the Knight a choice: either he can have an old, unattractive, yet loyal wife or a young and beautiful wife that will be unfaithful to him.  The knight decides to let his wife choose, and she transforms instead into a wife both beautiful and loyal, because he gave her the sovereignty to choose. The moral that the Wife of Bath is attempting to get across is that a woman's greatest wish is the same as a man's: to be loved as an autonomous equal within a relationship. Geoffrey Chaucer shook the ideology associated with gender roles in the fourteenth century. Women in the middle ages were seen as subordinates to men in all situations including marriage, with some rare exceptions, and the idea of women having control in male/female relationships was unpopular. Marriage was a concrete and exclusive bond between husband and wife, in which wives had to submit to their husband's authority in all matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McDougall |first=Sara |year=2013 |chapter=Women and Gender in Canon Law |pages=163–178 |title=Oxford Handbook of Women and Gender in Medieval Europe |editors=Judith Bennett and Ruth Mazo Karras |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-958217-4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the popularity that Chaucer gained in the Middle Ages, his concept of an authoritative woman in his literary works helped redefine (along with the help of historical figures such as [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Joan of Arc]]) the way Middle Age society regarded women. The theme of the loathly lady opposed the norms of a patriarchal society and played a role in the beginnings of a feminist critique. Geoffrey Chaucer's Wife of Bath was a critical voice that contrasted with the society that he lived in.  Using the loathly lady legend, she shapes the moral of her story to be that women always need control over themselves and should be allowed to exercise this privilege. This caught the attention of many scholars, which along with the other moral satires of Chaucer's writings, enabled it to be passed on to affect the ideologies of new generations.

'''Meltem Arıkan''' (born January 7, 1968 in [[Ankara]]) is a Turkish [[novelist]] and [[playwright]].

==Biography==
Arıkan was born and grew up in [[Ankara]], Turkey and is of Albanian heritage. Her first short stories and essays were published in various literary journals during 1992–1995. Her first novel, ''Ve… Veya… Belki… (And… Or… Maybe…)'' was published in 1999, followed by ''Evet... Ama... Sanki... (Yes… But… As If…)'' in 2000 and ''Kadin Bedenini Soyarsa (Undressing Herself)'' in 2002.

Her fourth novel ''Yeter Tenimi Acıtmayın (Stop Hurting My Flesh)'' which included women's trauma stories of child abuse, harassment and incest had been banned in early 2004 by the ''Committee to Protect the Minors from Obscene Publications'', a body established under the Turkish Prime Ministry, with the accusation of "Writing about the non-existing incest fact in Turkey, while using Turkish names for the characters, attempting to disturb the Turkish family order with a feminist approach." Following the legal procedures, the ban was lifted by the '1st Magistrate Criminal Court' after two months, and the book was published once again without being subjected to any censorship. After this experience of censorship, Arıkan has been awarded with “Freedom of Idea and Statement Prize 2004” by the Turkish Publishers’ Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meltemarikan.com/ Official Meltem Arıkan Web Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redpepper.org.uk/Disturbing-family-order Red Pepper Magazine, Laurie Penny's interview with Meltem Arikan (United Kingdom, 22 May 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkishauthors.com/kitapdetay.asp?kid=27 Stop Hurting My Flesh (Yeter Tenimi Acıtmayın) promotion on TurkishAuthors.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218224928/http://turkishauthors.com/kitapdetay.asp?kid=27 |date=2009-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/turkey.civilliberties The Guardian, Rahila Gupta's column ''Comment is Free'' (United Kingdom, 29 August 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her fifth novel ''Zaten Yoksunuz (You Exist In No Way)'' was published in 2005, followed by ''Umut Lanettir (Hope is a Curse)'' in 2006. After her first 6 novels, Arikan wrote the script for the play ''I’m Breaking the Game (Oyunu Bozuyorum)'' which premiered in August at the [[Zurich Theater Spectacle]], performed by Garajistanbul and awarded the “New Unique Play” prize from VIII. Lions Theatrical Awards in 2007. She published a research book titled ''Beden Biliyor (The Body Knows)'' in 2008. In 2009 another play, ''Parallel'', whose dramaturgy was by Arıkan, was staged by Garajistanbul as a part of the [[Linz]] 2009: [[European Capital of Culture]] program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linz09.at/en/veranstaltung-2227602/10_parallel.html Parallel at Linz 2009: European Capital of Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; Her last novel, ''Özlemin Beni Savuran (Your Yearning That Sways Me)'' was published in June 2009.

'''Natasha Blakeman''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Coronation Street]]'', played by [[Rachel Leskovac]]. The character first appeared onscreen during the episode airing on 12 May 2008.&lt;ref name="itv"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/soaps/coronationstreet/characters/m-pcharacters/natashablakeman/|title=Coronation Street - Natasha Blakeman|work=[[itv.com]]|publisher=[[ITV plc]]|date=July 2009|accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 April 2010, it was announced that Leskovac had been axed from the show after two years and would depart in "an exciting and dramatic storyline which will be an integral part of the build-up to Coronation Street's 50th anniversary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a217223/natasha-blakeman-to-leave-corrie.html|title= Natasha Blakeman to leave ''Corrie''|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=29 April 2010|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, it was suggested that Natasha was to take her own life, after she is left heartbroken of the break-up of her relationship with [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]), however, this never materialised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/2957646/Coronation-Streets-Natasha-Blakeman-in-suicide-plot.html|title=Natasha Blakeman in Suicide Plot|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=[[News International]]|author=|date=May 2010|accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Natasha made her last appearance on 27 September 2010.

==Casting==
[[Rachel Leskovac]] was to take on the role, with a Coronation Street spokesman confirming it: "Rachel's very well known in TV land as she has been in countless series and dramas. To have her new character in the salon is a smashing coup."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a94529/holby-actress-heads-to-corrie.html|title='Holby' actress heads to Corrie|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|author=Simon Reynolds|date=24 April 2008|accessdate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actress stated in an interview that she only felt really part of the backstage family when her character became more involved with central storylines saying: "Last year, it was a bit sporadic because I wasn't in for weeks on end, so every time I came back it felt like my first day again. It's only now in the new year that it's started to feel like I'm part of the family!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a149033/rachel-leskovac-natasha-blakeman-corrie.html|title=Rachel Leskovac (Natasha Blakeman, Corrie)|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=10 March 2009|accessdate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character development==
The character of Natasha has been described as a typical 'ditzy blonde' by newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/article2247191.ece|title=Rat's got Nat|first=Colin|last=Robertson|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=([[News International]])|date=18 February 2009|accessdate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview actress Rachel Leskovac had a lot to say about her character's personality: "I'd say Natasha's a romantic. She likes to have fun and isn't malicious in the slightest. She loves her job, too. I think she's looking for love but not necessarily settling down at the minute, though.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a149033/rachel-leskovac-natasha-blakeman-corrie.html|title=Rachel Leskovac (Natasha Blakeman, Corrie)|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|author=|date=10 March 2009|accessdate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her take on the character she plays after one year in the show. The character tends to talk a lot and generally say anything that comes into her head. ITV publicity describe the characters typical ditzy blonde image, describe her as loving Scottish accents and the sound of her own voice and hating shellfish and dandruff.&lt;ref name="itv"/&gt;

==Storylines==
In December 2008, Natasha informs [[Audrey Roberts]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) that her brother and sister-in-law have just had a baby daughter and are naming her Electra.

She spots a good business opportunity in opening the salon for late night trading hours during the week, an idea Audrey agrees to. Natasha is drafted in to style [[Molly Dobbs|Molly Compton]]'s ([[Vicky Binns]]) hair for her wedding day in January 2009.

In February, she flirts with [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]) in the Rovers and they go on a date but Steve is jealous that [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]) is dating [[Becky McDonald|Becky Granger]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]) and behaves quite badly during his and Natasha's date. She is not impressed by Steve as his idea of a date is a takeaway in the Rovers so when Steve asks her out again, she declines but tells him that there are no hard feelings.

On 23 March 2009, Natasha starts a relationship with [[Tony Gordon]] ([[Gray O'Brien]]) and initially, Natasha does most of the talking while Tony sits silently. Just as she is about to leave, he asks her to stop and take her coat off and the pair subsequently have sex.&lt;ref name="Sun"/&gt; Natasha is in good spirits, following her night with Tony, and tells [[Maria Connor]] ([[Samia Ghadie|Samia Smith]]) about it, making Maria jealous as she is developing romantic feelings for Tony herself. Maria tries to warn Natasha off him, claiming that he will treat her badly and even tries setting her up with [[Tom Kerrigan (Coronation Street)|Tom Kerrigan]] ([[Philip McGinley]]) but Natasha is happy with Tony. Some months later, Natasha becomes suspicious of the amount of time that Tony and Maria are spending together. Jealously, Natasha tells Maria that Tony is only paying her attention because he feels sorry for her. Tony is furious when he discovers what Natasha has said, leading to a showdown between them and they split up. Natasha tries to warn Maria about Tony's 'dark side' but she won't listen.

In April 2010, Natasha finds herself attracting the attention of [[Graeme Proctor]] ([[Craig Gazey]]). She is amused at his attempts to woo her until she discovers that he is doing the same with [[Rosie Webster]] ([[Helen Flanagan]]). They agree to teach him a lesson; Natasha feigns interest in Graeme and meets him for a drink at the Rovers where she playfully flirts with him. When she asks him about Rosie, he states that she is a bimbo and that he has no interest in her. At that moment, Rosie comes up behind him and pours a pint over his head, much to the amusement of the pub. Later that month, Natasha sets her sights on Audrey's grandson [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]) and he agrees to go out with her, after she makes her interest in him clear. However, after he cancels several dates, she angrily confronts him and he is impressed by her feisty personality, making him take their relationship more seriously but Natasha soon  feels excluded by Nick and his family, firstly as Nick's mother [[Gail McIntyre|Gail]]'s ([[Helen Worth]]) is very cold towards her and Nick constantly puts his business before their relationship. Eager to settle down, Natasha suggests they get a place together but Nick is preoccupied with business woes, due to Underworld recently burning down, and virtually ignores her. Worried about his dealings with ex-wife, [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]), she lends him £3,000 for new business premises to secure the future of the factory in an attempt to please him.

In July 2010, while organising a surprise 70th birthday party for Audrey, Natasha discovers that her boss is considering retiring and ambitious, Natasha offers to buy the salon and is not happy to learn that Maria also wants to buy the business. Natasha's insecurity is not helped by Nick's devious half-brother, [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]), telling her that Nick and Maria were once engaged and that she is just one of many women that Nick has been involved with. Despairing at Nick's lack of commitment, her problems worsen when she learns that she is pregnant in August. She is about to tell Nick this but he ends their relationship first as he feels she is too needy. Later, Natasha sees Nick and Leanne together at the factory and angrily tells him about the baby but Nick is angry that she didn't tell him sooner and storms off. Fearing she'd be a single parent, Natasha has an [[abortion]] but Nick visits Natasha, telling her that he wants them to be a family. Unsure how to tell him about the termination, she lets him believe that she is still expecting and events spiral out of control when Nick announces her pregnancy in the Rovers. After Natasha steals [[Fiz Stape]]'s ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) scan picture and passes it off as her own, she breaks down and admits the truth to Fiz when she realises what has happened. Seeing how these events are affecting her, Fiz urges her to tell Nick the truth but just as she is about to, Nick asks her to marry him and she agrees, much to Fiz's indignation. However, Gail is suspicious as Natasha's behaviour is not what you'd expect from a pregnant woman and checks her medical records. When she sees Natasha's abortion, she demands either Natasha tell him the truth or she will. Gail doesn't give Natasha much chance to tell Nick before she tells him, causing them to argue. Nick then tells Natasha that she will always be second best to Leanne and demands she move out, resulting in her attempting suicide by taking an overdose of prescription drugs. Feeling guilty about his actions, Nick returns to the flat and finding her unconscious, calls an ambulance and rushes her to the hospital, where she recovers. Nick tells her he is sorry and that they will try again once she is better. Natasha is discharged from hospital the next morning, and stays with Audrey while she recovers. Nick visits and asks if she wants to try for another baby, much to her surprise and delight. After Nick leaves, Audrey and Natasha have a heart-to-heart and Natasha realises that Nick doesn't love her and is simply trying to make amends for his past behaviour. Knowing that a relationship under those circumstances is doomed, she leaves Audrey's and returns to Coronation Street, wanting revenge on all those who misunderstood or were horrible to her.

During her visit, she berates Leanne for being a catalyst in her break-up with Nick and tells David that [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]) will never love him as he has no heart or feelings. She also goes to ''Underworld'' and causes chaos by telling the workers about Nick's special 'nicknames' for them, and saving best for last, she gets Gail sacked from the Medical Centre by revealing to [[Matt Carter (Coronation Street)|Dr. Matt Carter]] ([[Oliver Mellor]]) how Gail broke the rules of patient confidentiality by hacking into private medical records, her last words to Gail are: "Hope you have a Nice Life Gail, ooh look, I had my fingers crossed" before leaving. An empowered but tearful Natasha then leaves Weatherfield in the back of a taxi as Nick watches on.

==Reception==
Ruth Deller of entertainment website ''[[Lowculture]]'', who runs a monthly column on the most popular and unpopular soap opera characters, including Natasha, attributing her rise in popularity, stating: "A fairly new addition to Weatherfield, Natasha is proving so far very likeable. This could all change, but for now, we’re loving her work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2009/02/28/soapstar-superstars-february/|title=Soapstar Superstars: February|publisher=[[Lowculture]]|author=Deller, Ruth|date=28 February 2009|accessdate=13 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909003056/http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2009/02/28/soapstar-superstars-february/|archivedate=9 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deborah Ross (journalist)|Deborah Ross]] of ''[[The Independent]]'' described her as having "trapped a man by pretending to be pregnant" before adding that "Obviously, she cannot think nine months ahead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Deborah|title=Deborah Ross: 'My search for the perfect soap opera'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/deborah-ross-my-search-for-the-perfect-soap-opera-2073894.html|accessdate=6 October 2011|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|publisher=|date=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to her portrayal of Natasha on ''Coronation Street'', fellow soap opera ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] decided to cast Leskovac as [[Joanne Cardsley]] in the soap in September 2015, as he admired her performances as Natasha.&lt;ref name=bk&gt;{{cite journal|title=We had some really fierce discussions about who the 'Gloved Hand Killer' would be!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=24–30 October 2015|issue=42|pages=42, 45|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20322">[[Nineteenth-century theatre|Theatre in the nineteenth century]] was noted for its changing philosophy from the [[Romanticism]] and [[Neoclassicism]] that dominated Europe since the late 18th century to [[Realism (theatre)|Realism]] and [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] in the latter half of the 19th century before it eventually gave way to the rise of [[Modernism]] in the 20th century. Scenery in theater at the time closely mirrored these changes and, with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and technological advancement throughout the century, dramatically changed the aesthetics of the theater.

==Realism==
[[Theatrical realism]] was a general movement in 19th-century theatre from the time period of 1870-1960 that developed a set of dramatic and theatrical conventions with the aim of bringing a greater fidelity of real life to texts and performances. Part of a broader artistic movement, it included a focus on everyday middle-class drama, ordinary speech, and simple settings. This idea of representing subject matter truthfully, was evident in the changes that were made to scenic design in theater. Theatrical designers and directors began meticulously researching historical accuracy for their productions, which meant that scenery could no longer be drawn from stock - which was typically used over and over again in generic settings for different shows. [[Scenery]] began to be custom-designed and made for specific production. This meant, while scenery used to be seen as capital investment, it was not considered to be more disposable when the production was removed from the repertory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baugh|first1=Christopher|title=Theatre, Performance and Technology|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave MacMillion|pages=11–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenic Innovation==
One of the most important scenic transition into the century was from the often-used two-dimensional scenic backdrop to three-dimensional sets. Previously, as a two-dimensional environment, scenery did not provide an embracing, physical environment for the dramatic action happening on stage. This changed when three-dimensional sets were introduced in the first half of the century. This, coupled with change in audience and stage dynamic as well as advancement in theater architecture that allowed for hidden scene changes, the theater became more representational instead of presentational, and invited audience to be transported to a conceived 'other' world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baugh|first1=Christopher|title=Theatre, Performance and Technology|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave MacMillion|pages=11–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box Set===
The epitome of the new three-dimensional style sets and one of the most important advancement of scenic design was the popularization of the [[Box set (theatre)|box set]]. The box set has been around since the 17th century, but lacked support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brockett|first1=Oscar|last2=Mitchell|first2=Margaret|last3=Hardberger|first3=Linda|title=Making the Scene: A History of Stage Design and Technology in Europe and the United States|date=2010|publisher=Tobin Theatre Arts Fund|location=San Antonio, TX|pages=157–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] had introduced realistic stage furnishing in 1836 at her little Olympic Theatre in London, and forced them on American managers when she toured that country in 1838-1839.&lt;ref&gt;Taubman, Howard. The making of American theatre. New York: Coward McCann Inc., 196, pg 140&lt;/ref&gt; The box set was a gradual replacement of the painted wing-and-shutter sets. Between 1800 and 1875, many theater artists began to use them. A box set consists of flats hinged together to represent a room; it often has practicable elements, such as doors and windows, which can be used during the course of a play or show.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ben. THEATER IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. &lt;http://homepage.smc.edu/martin_ben/TheaterHistory/nineteenth.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; With the new pursuit of realism, room-like box settings now had heavy molding, real doors with doorknobs, and ample accurate furniture. Having the box set also meant that many theater artists began to stage all the action behind the proscenium in the late 1800s, thus reinforcing the illusion of a [[fourth wall]]. Audiences would be watching a “[[slice of life]]” through a window. Box sets allowed scenic designers to create better visualized atmospheres and moods.

==Aesthetic Style==
19th-century scenic styles in America were unique derivations from the European masters. Scenic artists from Europe brought with them the [[Romanticism|Romantic]], [[Baroque]], or classical landscapes that they knew from their homes, but the styles seemed to change when they landed on the American shore.&lt;ref&gt;Beuder, Susan Crabtree &amp; Peter. Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools, and Techniques. Ed. Taylor &amp; Francis. Illustrated. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The romantic English landscape painting style slowly adapted to the American image. The more rugged wild-western American landscape came to be idealized by native scenic artists throughout the century. Many theatres invested in generic scenery meant for virtually any production. An all-purpose set included landscapes, European cities, prison, palace, village, mountain pass, and forest.&lt;ref&gt;Beuder, Susan Crabtree &amp; Peter. Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools, and Techniques. Ed. Taylor &amp; Francis. Illustrated. 2005, pg 415&lt;/ref&gt;

The oleo was a versatile drop for any sort of entertainment. The oleo drop often hung in the in-one position, subdividing the stage into a shallower depth that was more appropriate for a brief interlude.&lt;ref&gt;Beuder, Susan Crabtree &amp; Peter. Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools, and Techniques. Ed. Taylor &amp; Francis. Illustrated. 2005, pg 415&lt;/ref&gt; The act curtain or drop curtain functioned as today's main drape, the decorative divider wall between audience and stage. Often, it was the most elaborate piece a theater owned and was painted to harmonize with the interior decorations of the theater itself.

==Technological Advancement==
During the nineteenth century, the technology of the [[industrial revolution]] was applied to theater.  Many historians believe that the popularity of [[melodrama]], with its emphasis on stage spectacle and special effects, accelerated these technological innovations: For example, [[Dion Boucicault]] was responsible for the introduction of fireproofing in the theater when one of his melodramatic plays called for an onstage fire.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ben. THEATER IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. &lt;http://homepage.smc.edu/martin_ben/TheaterHistory/nineteenth.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panorama===
While the invention of the [[panorama]] is attributed to [[Robert Barker (painter)|Robert Barker]] in 1787, [[Louis Jacques Daguerre]] is largely seen as having perfected the invention in the 19th century. He created the diorama: a still painting viewed by an audience sitting on a rotating platform. This soon gave way to the moving panorama: a setting painted on a long cloth, which could be unrolled across the stage by turning spools, created an illusion of movement and changing locales. A popular American play, [[William Dunlap]]'s ''A Trip to Niagara'' (1828), used this device to show a voyage from New York City to Niagara Falls via a steamboat.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ben. THEATER IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. &lt;http://homepage.smc.edu/martin_ben/TheaterHistory/nineteenth.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of the panoramas coupled with [[Charles Kean]]’s invention of the Corsican trap meant that entire horse and chariots races could be enacted on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Jack|last2=Fletcher Kernie|first2=Grant|title=A Cultural History of Theatre|date=1993|publisher=Longman|location=New York|pages=288–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on recreating natural environments onstage was probably influenced by romanticism, which called for a "return to nature." 
 
[[File:Elevator Stage.jpg|thumbnail|right|THE MOVABLE STAGE AT MADISON SQUARE THEATER, NEW YORK]]

===Elevator Stage===
On February 7, 1880, The Spirit of the Times announced: "Tonight Mr. J. Steele MacKaye will open the most exquisite theatre in the world, and all New York will assemble to do honor to the realization of his artistic visions…Mr. MacKaye will play the drama ''Hazel Kirke'' through with only two-minute waits between the acts, and will then exhibit the double stage—one compartment set for the kitchen of Blackburn Mill and other as boudoir at Fairy Grove Villa." MacKaye’s elevator stage was an important development of American drama and theatre. It was a solution to the problem posed by the increasing use of box sets to reproduce interior scenes in detail. With the elevator stage, multiple scenes could be changed in a fast and detailed way. This greatly improved the speed and efficiency of scenic changes, and that design didn’t have to be simplified, they could still be detailed. 
The elevator stage was described in ''[[Scientific American]]'', April 5, 1884.
"[It consists] of two theatrical stages, one above another, to be moved up and down as an elevator car is operated in a high building, and so that either one of them can easily and quickly be at any time brought to the proper level for acting thereon in front of the auditorium. While the play is proceeding before the audience, the assistants arrange another scene on the upper stage."&lt;ref&gt;French, Glenn Hughes &amp; Samuel. A history of the American theatre. Binghamton: Vail Ballot Press Inc., 1951, pg.234-236&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edwin Booth Theatre===
New styles of scenery meant that new means of scene shifting were needed. [[Booth's Theatre]], opened in 1869, was the first in a new generation of theaters built specifically to suit three-dimensional set pieces. It was the first theater to have a level stage floor (rather than a raked floor, as had been the standard in proscenium-arch theaters since the Renaissance) and no grooves in the stage floor for shifting flats. This idea would become the standard by the end of the century. Elevators and equipment for flying scenery also complemented the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brockett|first1=Oscar|last2=Mitchell|first2=Margaret|last3=Hardberger|first3=Linda|title=Making the Scene: A History of Stage Design and Technology in Europe and the United States|date=2010|publisher=Tobin Theatre Arts Fund|location=San Antonio, TX|pages=157–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage Lighting===
Nineteenth-century technology revolutionized stage lighting, which until then had been primitive. The introduction of [[gas lighting]] was the first step. In 1816, Philadelphia's Chestnut Street Theater became the earliest gas-lit playhouse in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Barnard. Theatre U.S.A. 1655-1957. University of Illinois: McGraw Hill Book Company, 1959, pg 105&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of gas lighting revolutionized stage lighting. It provided a somewhat more natural and adequate light for the playing and the scenic space upstage of the proscenium arch. However, this new richness in lighting provided difficulties at first. Though scenic painters had to learn to subdue their colors to the increased candle-power, the brightness only further highlight the disparity between three-dimensional set pieces and their two-dimensional backdrop and led to the latter's eventual decline. 
The advent of [[limelight]], also known as [[Drummond light]], also effectively introduced [[spotlighting]] to theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Jack|last2=Fletcher Kernie|first2=Grant|title=A Cultural History of Theatre|date=1993|publisher=Longman|location=New York|pages=288–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Edison]]'s electric incandescent lamp, invented in 1879, was the next step. It made electricity the most flexible, most controllable, and safest form of lighting, in the twentieth century, it would make stage lighting design a true art. These new means of illumination tremendously increased the control over stage light and stimulated interest in imitating lighting phenomena of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Barnard. Theatre U.S.A. 1655-1957. University of Illinois: McGraw Hill Book Company, 1959, pg 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noted Designers, Artists, and Technologists==

It was during this time that scenic artist began to be recognized for their work. Many of the scenic artists operated their own scenic studios in New York and towards the latter half of the century, the first theatrical unions were formed as a response to the [[Theatrical Syndicate|Theatre Syndicate]]. Producing who originally hired staff carpenters and company painters began to place their productions out to bid. It was also during this time period that designers began working with models to convey their design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larson|first1=Orville|title=Scene Design in the American Theatre from 1915 to 1960|date=1989|publisher=U of Arkansas|location=Fayetteville|pages=3–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*'''[[Steele MacKaye]]''' (1842-1894) was an innovative theater technologist who invented the elevator stage. In 1880, at the Madison Square Theater in New York, Mackaye used two stages: one above the other, which could be raised and lowered; while one stage was in view of the audience, the scenery on the other, which was either in the basement or in the fly area, could be changed.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Barnard. Theatre U.S.A. 1655-1957. University of Illinois: McGraw Hill Book Company, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[David Belasco]]''' (1853-1931) was an American producer, director and playwright, Mr. Belasco is primarily remembered today for his emphasis on naturalistic detail. David Belasco is best known for his ultra-realistic melodramas of the turn of the century. He and his chief scenic artist, George Gros, created meticulously detailed interiors, realistic exteriors, and stunning atmospheric effects.&lt;ref&gt;Beuder, Susan Crabtree &amp; Peter. Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools, and Techniques. Ed. Taylor &amp; Francis. Illustrated. 2005, pg.415&lt;/ref&gt; Belasco and Gros produced some of the most memorable scenic inventions of the American theatre and certainly some of the finest realistic scenery of the theatre history. His laborious scenic and lighting techniques were seen by the avant-garde as the embodiment of every ill of the stage and were severely ridiculed by history. In 1909, for a production of ''The Easiest Way'', his scenic artist placed the contents of a boarding house room, including the wallpaper, on the stage of the Stuyvesant Theatre and three years later (1912) he built on stage a fully functioning restaurant for the ''Governor's Lady''.&lt;ref&gt;Wild, Larry. A Brief History of Theatrical Scenery. 18 February 2002. 23 February 2006 &lt;http://www3.northern.edu/wild/ScDes/sdhist.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Alfred Roller Goethe's Faust.jpg|thumbnail|right|Alfred Roller, Before a Palace, for Goethe's Faust, Part II, Act V, Scene 17, 1911, Pen and black ink, watercolor and gouache, on paper]]
*'''[[Alfred Roller]]''' (1864-1935) was trained as a painter in Vienna, but his designs hinted at a new concept of scenic design.&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, Edwin Mims Jr. &amp; Oral. The Pageant of America- the American stage. Yale University Press, 1929, pg 338&lt;/ref&gt; Focused entirely on the interplay of light and color to create evocative stage spaces. Roller’s designs relied on a selected or simplified realism in which only few items were introduced to the stage, but each of them evocative, detailed and powerful. He utilized mobile scenic towers that could be rearranged and altered with light to form new shapes and movement patterns on the stage (Sumner 338). He was probably the earliest designer to embody and practice the ideas of Adolph Appia and Edward Gordon Craig.
*'''Charles Witham''' (1842-1926) was born in Portland, Maine and educated as an artist. He spent some time as an itinerant landscapist before becoming involved with the theater. Thanks to the friendship of Gaspard Maeder, Witham obtained his first theatre job as Maeder's assistant when the latter was chief designer for [[Niblo's Garden|Niblo’s Garden]] in New York in the early 1860s. By 1863, Witham had become head designer for the Boston Theater where he painted scenery for Edwin Forrest. His stay in Boston was short because he was hired by [[Edwin Booth]] to join his staff as scenic artist. He would go on to be Booth's primary designer for years to come. His collection of work remains the largest surviving theater scenic art from the time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larson|first1=Orville|title=Scene Design in the American Theatre from 1915 to 1960|date=1989|publisher=U of Arkansas|location=Fayetteville|pages=3–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Plays==
 [[File:Under the Gaslight Scene.jpeg|thumbnail|right|Scene from Daly's ''[[Under the Gaslight]]'' (1867)]]
*[[Under the Gaslight]] (1867), was one of the first of many plays to use a steam engine onstage while the hero was being tied to the railway tracks. “Despite the fact that, on the first night, the machinery of the great railroad scene failed to work properly, the audience was held in tense excitement, and the play from the outset was a success” It ran for 110 performances.&lt;ref&gt;French, Glenn Hughes &amp; Samuel. A history of the American theatre. Binghamton: Vail Ballot Press Inc., 1951, pg 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanical effects involved are said to have been patented by [[Augustin Daly]].
[[File:Crookfinale.jpg|thumbnail|left|Poster of musical theatre The Black Crook, representing the finale in which the amazons crush the forces of evil.]]
*There were many thrills in ''[[The Black Crook]]'' (1866), but the greatest of them was the corps de ballet and the hundred of costumes. After the premier, which lasted from 7:45pm till 1:15am, the Tribune reported that “The Scenery is magnificent; the ballet is beautiful; the drama is—rubbish…the last scene in the play, however, will dazzle and impress to even a greater degree, by its lavish richness and barbaric splendor. All that gold and silver, and gems and light, and woman’s beauty can contribute to fascinate the eye and charm the sense.&lt;ref&gt;French, Glenn Hughes &amp; Samuel. A history of the American theatre. Binghamton: Vail Ballot Press Inc., 1951, pg 199&lt;/ref&gt; The best exhibited scenery piece is the one that closes the second act. A vast grotto extending into an almost measureless perspective. Stalactites descend from the arched roof. A tranquil and lovely lake reflects the golden glories that span it like a vast sky. In every direction one sees the bright sheen or the dull richness of massy gold. Beautiful fairies and sprites make the scene luxuriant.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Barnard. Theatre U.S.A. 1655-1957. University of Illinois: McGraw Hill Book Company, 1959, pg 196.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Poor of New York]]'' (1899), scenically displaying such contrasts and spectacles as a rich home in Madison Square, a tenement house in Cross Street, with a fire, a bank in Nassau Street, and a snow storm in Union Square&lt;ref&gt;French, Glenn Hughes &amp; Samuel. A history of the American theatre. Binghamton: Vail Ballot Press Inc., 1951, pg 187,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The end of the 19th century witnessed both the height and the end of scenery painted in traditional perspective. Scenic design was realistic and creative that released the audience’s imagination. Realism was but a passing style. Towards the end of the century, realism would find an opposite in naturalism. [[Adolphe Appia]] and [[Edward Gordon Craig]] would be the ones to revolt against the idea of the actor standing on a flat floor surrounded by “realistic” painted canvases. Their controversial ideas would be the basis of the New Stagecraft. The 20th century would bring the scenic designer an entirely new aesthetic for the world of the theatre in the form of [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Modernism]]. As movies replaced theatre’s popularity, an international aesthetic weighed in against painted scenery, scenic studios began to shrink, and scenic artists began to disappear. The golden age of scenic painting of the 19th century rapidly turned to a much more fragmented one in 20th century, as theatre styles changed radically and eventually the theatre lost popularity to movies and television.

'''''Paper Heart''''' is a 2009 American [[romantic comedy]] film starring [[Charlyne Yi]] and [[Michael Cera]] as fictionalized versions of themselves based on their rumored relationship, though Yi has said they never dated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/charlyne-yi-admits-relationship-paper-heart-co-star-michael-cera-article-1.398380 New York Daily News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/movies/07paper.html?_r=0 The New York Times review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/movies/02itzk.html The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot for the film is based on Charlyne Yi's original idea of a documentary, which Nick Jasenovec suggested would be accentuated with a fictional storyline.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'' episode 1036&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' episode 94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:JakeJohnsonCharlyneYiNickJasenovecByPhilKonstantin.jpg|thumb|left|Jake Johnson, Charlyne Yi, and Nick Jasenovec]]
The film follows Charlyne as she embarks on a quest across America to make a documentary about a subject she does not understand: love. As she and her good friend (and director) Nick search for answers and advice about love, Charlyne talks with friends, strangers, scientists, bikers, romance novelists, and children. They each offer diverse views on modern romance, as well as various answers to the age-old question: does true love really exist?

Shortly after filming begins, Charlyne meets a boy after her own heart: Michael Cera. As their relationship develops on camera, her pursuit to discover the nature of love takes on a fresh new urgency.

'''Polyhymnia''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ɒ|l|i|ˈ|h|ɪ|m|n|i|ə}}; {{lang-el|Πολυύμνια}}; "the one of many hymns"), also spelt '''Polymnia''' (Πολύμνια) was in [[Greek mythology]] the [[Muse]] of sacred poetry, sacred [[hymn]], dance, and [[eloquence]] as well as [[agriculture]] and [[pantomime]]. Her name comes from the Greek words "poly" meaning "many" and "hymnos", which means "praise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/MousaPolyhymnia.html|title=Polyhymnia|last=|first=|date=|website=theoi|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is depicted as very serious, pensive and meditative, and often holding a finger to her mouth, dressed in a long [[cloak]] and [[veil]] and resting her elbow on a pillar. Polyhymnia is also sometimes credited as being the Muse of [[geometry]] and [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="talesbeyondbelief"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.talesbeyondbelief.com/nymphs/polyhymnia-muse.htm|title=Polyhymnia|last=|first=|date=|website=talesbeyondbelief|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bibliotheca historica]], [[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote, "Polyhymnia, because by her great (polle) praises (humnesis) she brings distinction to writers whose works have won for them immortal fame...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/DiodorusSiculus4A.html Diodorus Siculus] Library of History (Books III - VIII). Translated by Oldfather, C. H. Loeb Classical Library Volumes 303 and 340. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;  She appears in Dante's [[Divine Comedy]]: Paradiso. Canto XXIII, line 56, and is referenced in modern works of fiction.

== Polyhymnia in astronomy ==
In [[astronomy]], there are nine asteroids named after the [[Muses]]. The one named after Polyhymnia is a main belt asteroid discovered by [[Jean Chacornac]], a French astronomer, in 1854.&lt;ref name="talesbeyondbelief"/&gt;

== Dedications ==
On Mount Parnassus, there was a spring that was sacred to Polyhymnia and the other Muses. It was said to flow between two big rocks above [[Delphi]], then down into a large square basin. The water was used by the [[Pythia]], who were priests and priestesses, for oracular purposes including divination.&lt;ref name="talesbeyondbelief"/&gt;

"'''Suicides'''" is a [[short story]] by French writer [[Guy de Maupassant]]. It was originally published on 29 August 1880 in the French newspaper ''[[Le Gaulois]]''. On 17 April 1883, it was published in ''[[Gil Blas (periodical)|Gil Blas]]'' under the pseudonym Maufrigneuse, and by other three periodicals, before being republished in the short story collection ''[[Les Sœurs Rondoli]]'' in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;''Maupassant, contes et nouvelles'', p. 1331, [[Bibliothèque de la Pléiade]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The narrator finds a letter from a man who killed himself officially «without reason». This man of fifty-seven describes his life: thirty years of boredom, always repeated gestures and loneliness. Suffering from stomach pain, he can not eat much «what is still the greatest happiness». That evening he starts a task constantly postponed, to store in his desk correspondence and memories of a lifetime. Moved to tears by all these old stories which come to mind, he looks horrified «the hideous and lonely old age and the coming infirmities». He shoots himself in the head.
== Theme==
The theme of this story is that suicide can be caused by minor causes like solitude and boredom.

'''Surautomatism''' is any theory or act in practice of [[surrealism|surrealist]] [[creative production]] taking, or purporting to take, [[surrealist automatism|automatism]] to its most absurd limits.  

In their 1945 statement ''Dialectique de la Dialectique'', [[Romania]]n surrealists [[Gherashim Luca]] and [[Dolfi Trost]] wrote,

:We have returned  to the problem of knowledge through images... by establishing a clear distinction between images produced by artistic means and images resulting from rigorously applied scientific procedures, such as the operation of chance or of automatism. We stand opposed to the tendency to reproduce, through symbols, certain valid theoretical contents by the use of pictorial techniques, and believe that the unknown that surrounds us can find a staggering materialization of the highest order in indecipherable images. In generally accepting until now pictorial reproductive means, surrealist painting will find that the way to its blossoming lies in the absurd use of aplastic, objective and entirely non-artistic procedures.

The name surautomatism suggests "going beyond" automatism, but whether surautomatism is anything but a group of methods by which surrealist automatism is practiced is controversial.

Surautomatism includes [[cubomania]], [[Surrealist techniques#Entopic graphomania|entopic graphomania]] and various types of what the Romanian surrealists called "indecipherable writing".

Gablik’s ''The Reenchantment of Art'' announced her disenchantment with “the compulsive and oppressive consumeristic framework in which we do our work,” and argued that a re-connection to the primordial and to ritual might allow “for a return of soul.”&lt;ref name="Reenchantment"&gt;Gablik, Suzi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1908">'''Teatro Rossini''' is the name of an opera house in [[Pesaro]], Italy that serves as a venue for the [[Rossini Opera Festival]].

Built as the ''Teatro Nuovo'' (on the site of the original 1637 ''Teatro del Sole''), it was inaugurated on 10 June 1818 with a performance of [[Gioacchino Rossini]]'s ''[[La gazza ladra]]'' conducted by the composer in the town of his birth. It seats 860, with an auditorium designed in the classic horseshoe shape with four tiers of boxes plus the gallery.

The theatre took its present name in the composer's honour in 1854.

After a 1930 earthquake it required structural renovations. It re-opened in August 1934 with a performance of ''[[Guglielmo Tell]]''. In 1966, however, cracks in the walls and decaying woodwork led to its being declared unsafe, and it was closed for 14 years. It re-opened again on 6 April 1980, the same year as the first [[Rossini Opera Festival]] took place. Since then it has been the home of the annual festival, which is held in August. Additional renovations took place in 2002.

== Biography ==
Brewer is an award-winning writer, director, actress and teacher who lived in extremely Lower Houghton. (Hillbrow) before moving to the rural extremes of Hennops River.

She is third generation in the South African film/TV and theatre industry and did her first gig crying for a nappy commercial at six months old.  Her grandfather was Jimmy Hunter (stand-up comic and producer of Jimmy Hunter’s ''Brighton Follies''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Brighton/MusicHallAtThePalacePierBrighton.htm|title=Articles, Images, and Programme for Music Hall at The Palace Pier Theatre, Brighton|website=www.arthurlloyd.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/regional/london/1937-08-05|title=Regional Programme London - 5 August 1937 - BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Her father was Bill Brewer (comic, actor, musician, composer, writer, critic on The Sunday Times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esat.sun.ac.za/index.php/Bill_Brewer|title=Bill Brewer - ESAT|website=esat.sun.ac.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0108117/|title=Bill Brewer|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=JaniAllan|author=Jani Allan|number=530810885452087296|date=7 November 2014|title=Bill Brewer,theatre critic and actor once said ‘'I’m not an atheist – I believe in Taubie Kushlick! @PalluSA}}/photo/1&lt;/ref&gt;) and her mother was Fiona Fraser (actress, director, writer, mentor and activist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2006-12-22-theatre-personality-fiona-fraserbrewer-dies-at-77|title=Theatre personality Fiona Fraser-Brewer dies at 77|first=Sumayya|last=Ismail|website=mg.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2404204/|title=Fiona Fraser|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esat.sun.ac.za/index.php/Fiona_Fraser|title=Fiona Fraser - ESAT|website=esat.sun.ac.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=ywqdkp3GOxoC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;dq=fiona+fraser+actress&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t7RtV5ZKEf&amp;sig=oRydJPl3mLS2ckUBBx1XCPNIa2k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTtMTb86DNAhVCD8AKHYmeBGYQ6AEISDAL#v=onepage&amp;q=fiona+fraser+actress&amp;f=false|title=Starting Again in Egoli|first=Sheila|last=Ward|date=30 May 2013|publisher=AuthorHouse|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

In her own words Thandi described her family in “Of Pigs and Psychopaths” – her unpublished biography of her family:

{{quote|"All people have the right to go to hell in their own way.  My family always chose the scenic route.
  
Yesterday, my ten-year-old daughter, Cody, came home in tears from her upmarket, hideously expensive school.  A school that is a glass bubble of protectiveness in the New South Africa, for which privilege I pay through my nose, and every other orifice.

"I'm the outsider Mom," she says.  "No one will play with me.  They say I'm poor.  And weird.  And my family's weird".  I sigh.  "We are weird, Noo.  And poor.  Deal with it". She went to bed, woebegone.  And I could do nothing to make this small rite of passage easier for her.  A comment from the headmistress of my equally Upmarket, wildly expensive, Convent school, which tried to imbue small savages with the 4 Rs - reading, riting, rithamtic and respectability, where I too was weird and an outsider. "Everyone remarks what a normal little girl Thandi is."  Beat. "Considering her background".

I am third generation theatre, a child of theatre foyers and rehearsal rooms. My grandmother was a singer and comedienne. My step-grandfather, a stand up comic and producer. My father, a comic, pianist, writer, composer, personality, producer, actor and finally critic - a good resting place for all his other skills. My mother, an actress and writer herself.  I am doublebred for this life, from a family who melded myth, mayhem and magic into something that sometimes resembled a soap opera, more often a sitcom, with all the self-dramatization and chaos that entails. I come from three generations of non-marrying women which is in itself another story.

So now I do for my daughter what three generations have trained me to.  I use words to make sense of it all, to try and tease out the reality from the publicity releases, to fit the jigsaws together with my own glue - words. Words are dangerous.  They turn on you, they go for the throat and draw blood, they twist under your hand into something strange and unknown to you, filled with meanings that you never anticipated.  Trust me on this.  I make my living from them, and I've never yet learned to tame them.  Put a word around an idea, and it changes it.  Put a word around a person, and they have gone, but the word remains.

My job as scriptwriter is to find a pattern.  To find an ending, and a beginning.

And this is one beginning.

The story starts, as all good stories should, with a picture.  Just one.  My 72-year-old mother is talking to her lecturer in Feminist Literature. "Your life," says the professor, "Is a Feminist Manifesto."
And once again, I'm struck by the incongruity of Intellectual Analysis versus Experience.  To this well-meaning feminist, my mother's life is Manifesto.  To me, it's Narrative.  A tale of two resilient  and robust spirits who forged lives and made choices that were not acceptable then, and are seldom acceptable now. My mother.  My grandmother. And because I make my living, such as it, forging words for other people to make images of, I start with an image and a phrase. Traditional, trite and true.

Once upon a time …

There lived."
(Of Pigs and psychopaths)}}

The painting measures {{convert|65.3|xx|78.7|cm}}.{{cn|date=August 2018}} It depicts two well-dressed women who are sitting facing each other in a cramped first-class railway carriage, like mirror images.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/great-works/egg-augustus-the-travelling-companions-1862-744405.html |work=[[The Independent]] |title=Egg, Augustus: The Travelling Companions (1862)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women may be sisters,&lt;ref name="Sisters"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6wbSDm-co28C&amp;pg=PA13 |pp=13–14 |year=1995 |last=Cohen |first=Michael |title=Sisters: Relation and Rescue in Nineteenth-century British Novels and Paintings}}&lt;/ref&gt; or may represent two elements of the character of one woman. 

The women are dressed identically, in the same voluminous grey silk travelling clothes, with their hats identically placed on their laps.&lt;ref name="Sisters"/&gt; They are arranged symmetrically on seats to either side of the carriage window.  The window has three parts, framing the view like a triptych. The coastline of [[Menton]], on the French Riviera, is visible through the window, but neither woman seems to be paying any attention to this.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WYaRX58a0_IC&amp;pg=PA233 |p=233 |year=2004 |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Art |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198604761}}&lt;/ref&gt; The train is in motion, witnessed by the swinging tassel on the window blind. The carriage itself is symmetrical, as the women are.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;

The symmetry is broken, however: while the woman to the left sleeps next to a basket of fruit, the other to the right is reading beside a bouquet of flowers.&lt;ref name="Sisters"/&gt; The painting could be read as a Victorian version of [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[Industry and Idleness]]''.

== Making ==
Egg travelled frequently to the south of England and the [[south of France]], seeking relief from his life-long asthma.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

It was one of the last paintings made by Egg before his death in 1863.

== Influences ==
[[File:Alice guard.jpg|thumb|Engraving by [[John Tenniel]] from ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'']]
Railway art became popular after [[William Powell Frith]]'s 1862 painting ''[[The Railway Station]]''.

The painting influenced an engraved illustration by [[John Tenniel]] in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', in which [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] wears a similar costume and hat in a railway carriage, sitting opposite [[Benjamin Disraeli]], wearing a paper hat, and a goat.

[[File:Coa_Illustration_Cross_Triquetra.svg|right|thumb|Interlaced triquetra which is a [[trefoil knot]]]]
'''Triquetra''' ({{IPAc-en|t|r|aɪ|ˈ|k|w|ɛ|t|r|ə}}; from the Latin adjective ''triquetrus'', three-cornered) denotes a particular complicated shape formed of three ''[[Vesica piscis|vesicae piscis]]'' (the leaf-like shape in between two equal diameter circles each centered on the circumference of the other), sometimes with an added circle in or around the three lobes. Also known as a "trinity knot" when parallel doubled-lines are in the graph, the design is used as a religious symbol adapted from ancient Pagan Celtic images by Christianity. It is similar to Odin's symbol, the [[valknut]].

==Ancient usage==

===Celtic art===
The triquetra is often found in [[insular art]], most notably metal work and in [[illuminated manuscript]]s like the ''[[Book of Kells]]''. It is also found in similar artwork on Celtic crosses and slabs from the early Christian period. The fact that the triquetra rarely stood alone in medieval Celtic art has cast reasonable doubt on its use as a primary symbol of belief. In manuscripts it is used primarily as a space filler or ornament in much more complex compositions, and in knotwork panels it is a design motif integrated with other design elements.  This widely recognised knot has been used as a singular symbol for the past two centuries by Celtic Christians, pagans and agnostics as a sign of special things and people that are threefold.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Stephen (2001). "[http://www.celtarts.com/in_search_of_meaning.htm In Search of Meaning]", ''Dalriada Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese use===
The triquetra has been a known symbol in Japan called ''Musubi Mitsugashiwa''. Being one of the forms of the [[Aryan]] [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Iakšaku dynasty]] signs, it reached Japan with the dynasty's [[Kāśyapīya]] spreading technology and [[Buddhism]] via [[Kingdom of Khotan]], after which the Japanese sword [[katana]] is called, [[Chinese Buddhism|China]] and [[Korean Buddhism|Korea]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Germanic paganism===
The triquetra has been found on [[runestone]]s in Northern Europe and on early [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] coins. It presumably had [[Germanic paganism|pagan]] religious meaning and it bears a resemblance to the ''[[valknut]]'', a symbol associated with [[Odin]].

===Christian use===
The symbol has been used in [[Christian Church|Christian]] tradition as a sign of the [[Trinity]] ([[God the Father|Father]], [[Jesus Christ|Son]] and [[Holy Spirit]]), especially since the Celtic revival of the 19th century. When modern designers began to display the triquetra as a stand-alone design, it recalled the three-leafed shamrock which was similarly offered as a Trinity symbol by Saint Patrick{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}. 
It has also been suggested that the triquetra has a similarity to the Christian [[Ichthys|Ιχθυς]] symbol. The triquetra has been used extensively on Christian sculpture, vestments, book arts and stained glass. It has been used on the title page and binding of some editions of the [[New King James Version]]{{examples|date=November 2014}}.

A very common representation of the symbol is with a circle that goes through the three interconnected loops of the triquetra. The circle emphasises the unity of the whole combination of three forces. It is also said to symbolise [[God]]'s love around the Holy Trinity.

==Modern use==
In contemporary Ireland, it is traditional for lovers to exchange jewelry such as a necklace or rings signifying their affection. The triquetra, also known as a "trinity knot", is often found as a design element is popular Irish jewelry such as [[Claddagh ring|claddaghs]] and other wedding or engagement rings.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, Seán (1999). ''Story of the Claddagh Ring''. Mercier Press. {{ISBN|9781856351898}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page missing|date=October 2018}}

===Neopaganism===
It is difficult to date the exact origin of the Irish triquetra, and whether it was first used in a Christian or [[Celtic polytheism|pagan]] context; the distinctive interlace/knotwork artistic style did not fully develop until ca. the 7th century AD, but the triquetra is the [[trefoil knot|simplest possible knot]]. [[Celtic neopaganism|Celtic pagans]], or even [[Neopaganism|neopagans]] who are not of a Celtic cultural orientation, may use the triquetra to symbolise a variety of concepts and mythological figures.

Due to its presence in insular Celtic art, [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Celtic Reconstructionists]] use the triquetra either to represent one of the various triplicities in their cosmology and theology (such as the tripartite division of the world into the realms of Land, Sea and Sky),&lt;ref name="Mac Mathúna"&gt;Mac Mathúna, Liam (1999) [http://www.celt.dias.ie/publications/celtica/c23/c23-174.pdf "Irish Perceptions of the Cosmos"] ''Celtica'' vol. 23 (1999), pp.174–187&lt;/ref&gt; or as a symbol of one of the specific Celtic [[Triple deity|triple goddesses]], for example the battle goddess, [[The Morrígan]].

[[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic neopagan]] groups who use the triquetra to symbolise their faith generally believe it is originally of Norse and Germanic origins.

The symbol is also sometimes used by wiccans and some [[new age]]rs to symbolise the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]], or as a protective symbol.&lt;ref name="scott-cunningham"&gt;{{Citation |last=Cunningham |first=Scott |authorlink=Scott Cunningham |title=Wicca: A Guide to the Solitary Practitioner |year=2004 |origyear=1988 |publisher=Llewellyn |location=Woodbury, MN, U.S.A. |isbn=978-0-87542-118-6 |page=191 |chapter=Rune Magic}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture===
&lt;!-- Do not add more pop culture mentions here unless they are 1. sourced and 2.vplay a significant role in the symbology or identification of the referenced subject. Other additions will be deleted as spam. --&gt;

The triquetra is often used artistically as a design element when [[Celtic knotwork]] is used. Many who identify as [[modern Celts]] may use the symbol to display an identification with [[Celtic Europe|Celtic culture]], whether they live in the [[Celtic Nations]] or the [[diaspora]].

====In literature and publications====

====In television====

'''''Vestoj''''' (meaning "clothing" in [[Esperanto]]) is an annual [[academic journal]] about [[dress]] and [[fashion]]. The [[editor-in-chief]] and publisher is Anja Aronowsky Cronberg.

==History==
''Vestoj – the Journal of Sartorial Matters'' was established by [[editor-in-chief]] and publisher Anja Aronowsky Cronberg in 2009. It sets out to "combine theoretical knowledge about fashion with experience from the fashion industry. In the first issue a manifesto was formulated that more than anything was about bridging the gap between fashion as an academic subject of study and fashion as a business".&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Karin, Det Svenska Modeundret, Norstedts, Stockholm, 2011, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; It "stands apart from the current crop of new magazines because of its consciously intellectual stance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ualresearchonline.arts.ac.uk/3799/ |title=Here is the secret, here is the trick |author=O'Neill, Alistair |work=UAL Research Online |accessdate=2013-06-25 |date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vestoj'' combines scholarly texts about fashion with [[fiction]], [[nonfiction]], [[poetry]], and [[visual arts|visuals]]. Each issue is thematic and its subject matter is reflected in both editorial content and art direction. Every issue consequently has a different logo, style, format, and graphic design. In contrast to the majority of [[list of fashion magazines|fashion magazines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=David|first1=Alison Matthews|title=''Vogue's'' New World: American Fashionability and the Politics of Style|journal=Fashion Theory|date=21 April 2015|volume=10|issue=1-2|pages=13–38|doi=10.2752/136270406778051049}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vestoj'' contains no advertising and does not revolve around the fashion seasonal calendar.

==Reception==
''Vestoj'' has been called "one of the most successful attempts to provide the young academic discipline fashion studies with an equivalent to, say, the medical journal ''The Lancet''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidbloggen.se/2009/11/24/vestoj-allvarligt-talat-om-mode-pa-esperanto/ |title=Vestoj: Allvarligt talat. Om mode. På esperanto. Och engelska |work=Sidbloggen |author=Wirfält, Johan |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2013-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110053031/http://www.sidbloggen.se/2009/11/24/vestoj-allvarligt-talat-om-mode-pa-esperanto/ |archivedate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and journalist [[Fredrik Strage]] labelled ''Vestoj'''s first issue as one of the best new magazines in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidbloggen.se/titlar/vestoj/ |title=Vestoj |author=Strage, Fredrik |work=Sidbloggen |accessdate=2013-06-25 |date=2010-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302042016/http://www.sidbloggen.se/titlar/vestoj/ |archivedate=March 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal was also described as a publication that "connects intellectual strength and aesthetic refinement"&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anothermag.com/current/view/1384/Anja_Aronowsky-Cronberg |title=An Intellectual Fashion - Anja Aronowsky-Cronberg |author=Grau, Donatien |work=AnOther |accessdate=2013-06-25 |date=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' said that "flicking through ''Vestoj'' gives rise to the same feeling of pleasure that enjoying an old 1950s issue of ''Reader's Digest'': it's engaging, charming, personal and tongue in cheek – without ever compromising the [[intellectual]] quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svd.se/kultur/mode-de-nya-tidningarna_4852911.svd |title=Mode - de nya tidningarna &amp;#124; Kultur |authorlink=Karin Ström |author=Ström, Karin |work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |accessdate=2013-06-25 |date=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on AnOthermag.com, Aronowsky Cronberg explains her approach, stating that ''Vestoj'' aims to have "an intelligent and multi-facetted approach to sartorial matters. What I find the most interesting methodology is the one that deals with both the production and consumption of a garment, as well as with the analysis of it. […] Through the study of fashion you can understand any given point in history, our desires, ideals, wants and needs. The aspect of fashion that deals with voracious consumption has spread into every way we relate to [[culture]]; today we consume ideas, knowledge and people as much as we consume goods. Fashion in that sense is nothing short of a Gesamtkunstwerk." &lt;ref name=interview /&gt;

'''Zainul Abedin''' (29 December 1914&amp;nbsp;– 28 May 1976) was a Bengali painter. He became well known in 1944 through his Famine Series paintings of 1943. After the partition of India and Pakistan he moved to Pakistan, and when Bangladesh was created in 1971, he was rightly considered by [[Syed Manzoorul Islam]] as the founding father of Bangladeshi [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zainul Abedin |url=http://artist.christies.com/Zainul-Abedin-8989-bio.aspx |website=artist.christies.com |publisher=Christie's |accessdate=5 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017081445/http://artist.christies.com/Zainul-Abedin-8989-bio.aspx#loadProfileContent |archivedate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 he helped establish the Institute of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka|Faculty of Fine Arts]]) at [[Dhaka University]].&lt;ref name="Alom193873"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alom |first1=Zahangir |title=Homage to Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/event/homage-shilpacharya-zainul-abedin-193873 |accessdate=5 January 2016 |work=The Daily Star |date=29 December 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105153748/http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/event/homage-shilpacharya-zainul-abedin-193873 |archivedate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Indian Express]] described him as a Legendary Bangladeshi painter.&lt;ref name="indianexpress"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sinha |first1=Nidhi |title=Celebrating the work of Bangladeshi painter and activist Zainul Abedin |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/for-the-people-7/ |accessdate=5 January 2016 |work=The Indian Express|date=27 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927084103/http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/for-the-people-7/ |archivedate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many of his contemporaries, his paintings on the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] is probably his most characteristic work. He was given the title ''Shilpacharya'' (Great Teacher of the Arts) in [[Bangladesh]] for his artistic and visionary qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noor pays tribute to Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin|url=http://bssnews.net/newsDetails.php?cat=0&amp;id=458653&amp;date=2014-12-29|website=''bssnews.net''|accessdate=5 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106090759/http://www.bssnews.net/newsDetails.php?cat=0&amp;id=458653&amp;date=2014-12-29|archivedate= 6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weeklyholiday.net/Homepage/Pages/UserHome.aspx?ID=9&amp;date=12/30/2011 |title=‘Zainul's devotion to art never bothered me,’ says Jahanara |work=Weekly Holiday |location=Dhaka |publisher=Holiday Publication Limited |date=11 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109170901/http://weeklyholiday.net/Homepage/Pages/UserHome.aspx?ID=9&amp;date=12%2F30%2F2011 |archivedate=9 January 2016 |accessdate=9 January 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bdnews24.com/lifestyle/2005/12/28/photography-exhibition-on-zainul-s-life-begins-at-du |title=Pho Photography exhibition on Zainul's life begins at DU |work=[[Bdnews24.com]] |location=Dhaka |date=28 December 2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109172459/http://bdnews24.com/lifestyle/2005/12/28/photography-exhibition-on-zainul-s-life-begins-at-du |archivedate=9 January 2016 |accessdate=9 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Abedin was born in [[Kishoreganj]], [[East Bengal]] on 29 December 1914.&lt;ref name="star56215"&gt;{{cite news |title=Zainul Abedin's birth centenary event starts |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/zainul-abedins-birth-centenary-event-starts-56215 |accessdate=5 January 2016 |work=The Daily Star |date=20 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105161823/http://www.thedailystar.net/zainul-abedins-birth-centenary-event-starts-56215 |archivedate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his childhood was spent near the scenic banks of the [[Brahmaputra river]]. The Brahmaputra would later appear in many of his paintings and be a source of inspiration all throughout his career. Many of his works framed ''Brahmaputra'' and a series of watercolors that Abedin did as his tribute to the river earned him the Governor's Gold Medal in an all-India exhibition in 1938. This was the first time when he came under spotlight and this award gave Abedin the confidence to create his own visual style.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Manzoorul Islam |first=Syed |authorlink=Syed Manzoorul Islam |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A.|encyclopedia=Banglapedia |title=Abedin, Zainul |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Abedin,_Zainul |date=16 June 2014 |edition=2nd |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |location=Dhaka |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Abedin was admitted to Calcutta Government Art School in [[Calcutta]]. Here for five years he learned British/ European academic style and later he joined the faculty of the same school after his graduation. He was the first Muslim student to obtain first class distinction from the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Islam |first1=Monwarul |title=Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin's birth centenary today |url=http://newagebd.net/81098/shilpacharya-zainul-abedins-birth-centenary-today/ |accessdate=5 January 2016 |work=New Age |date=29 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629091748/http://newagebd.net/81098/shilpacharya-zainul-abedins-birth-centenary-today/ |archivedate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was dissatisfied with the oriental style and the limitations of European academic style and this led him towards realism. He was the pioneer of the modern art movement that took place in Bangladesh. In 1948 he, with the help of few of his colleagues, founded an art institute in [[Dhaka]]. Back then, there were no art institutes present in Dhaka. It was considered the best art institute in [[Pakistan]] during its early years. He worked in the Pakistani government for a while.&lt;ref name="dawn776951"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/776951/portrait-of-an-artist-in-divided-south-asia |title=Portrait of an artist in divided South Asia |work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|DAWN]] |location=Karachi |date=6 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105164034/http://www.dawn.com/news/776951/portrait-of-an-artist-in-divided-south-asia |archivedate=5 January 2016 |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at the institute and among his students was Pakistani artist Mansur Rahi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chatterjee |first=Partha |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2624/stories/20091204262408800.htm |title=Gentle rainbow |work=Frontline |date=4 December 2009 |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught Bangladeshi artist [[Mohammad Kibria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Haq |first=Fayza |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2011/07/01/feature.htm |title="To sir, with love"– Kibria: Immortal in our hearts |location=Dhaka |work=The Daily Star |date=1 July 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027092104/http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2011/07/01/feature.htm |archivedate=27 October 2013 |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his two years of training from an art school in London, he began a new style, the "Bengali style", where the main features were: folk forms with their geometric shapes, sometimes semi-abstract representation, and the use of primary colors. But he lacked the sense of perspective. Later he realized the limitations of folk art, so he went back to the nature, rural life and the daily struggles of man to make art that would be realistic but modern in appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/shilpacharya-zainul-abedins-39th-death-anniversary/ |title=Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin's 39th death anniversary |work=Dhaka Courier |location=Dhaka |date=4 June 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110030628/http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/shilpacharya-zainul-abedins-39th-death-anniversary/ |archivedate=10 January 2016 |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newagebd.net/80948/museum-displays-100-artworks-of-shilpacharya/ |title=Museum displays 100 artworks of Shilpacharya |work=[[New Age (Bangladesh)|New Age]] |location=Dhaka |date=29 December 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110171127/http://newagebd.net/80948/museum-displays-100-artworks-of-shilpacharya/ |archivedate=10 January 2016 |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paintings==
[[Image:Jainul Abedin Museum.jpg|right|thumb|Jainul Abedin Gallary]]

Among all the contemporary works of Abedin, his famine sketches of the 1940s are his most remarkable works. He created his famine painting set, which, when exhibited in 1944, brought him even more critical acclaim. The miserable situation of the starving people during the Great Famine of Bengal in 1943 touched his heart. He made his own ink by burning charcoal and used it on cheap, ordinary packing paper. He depicted those starving people who were dying by the road-side.&lt;ref name="Alom193873"/&gt; Abedin not only documented the famine, he also revealed the famine's sinister face through the skeletal figures of people fated to die of starvation.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Alom |first=Zahangir |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/fine-art-and-artists-through-the-eyes-of-fayza-haq-50833 |title=Fine art and artists through the eyes of Fayza Haq |work=The Daily Star |location=Dhaka |date=18 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208130702/http://www.thedailystar.net/fine-art-and-artists-through-the-eyes-of-fayza-haq-50833 |archivedate=8 February 2015 |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abedin depicted this inhuman story with very human emotions. These drawings became iconic images of human suffering. These sketches helped him find his way in a realistic approach that focused on the human suffering, struggle and protest. He was more socially aware focusing on the working class and their struggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wepk/hd_wepk.htm |title=Modern Art in West and East Pakistan |last=Ali |first=Atteqa |work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231082924/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wepk/hd_wepk.htm |archivedate=31 December 2015 |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rebel Cow marks a high point of that style. This particular brand of realism combines social inquiry and the protest with higher aesthetics. He was an influential member of the [[Calcutta Group]] of progressive artists and was friends with [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy|Shahid Suhrawardy]] and [[Ahmed Ali (writer)|Ahmed Ali]] of the [[Progressive Writers' Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=236059 |title=Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin's 36th death anniversary observed |work=he Daily Star |location=Dhaka |date=29 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105174730/http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=236059 |archivedate=5 January 2016 |accessdate=5 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made modernist paintings of [[Santhal people]]. Notable among them is "Two Santhal Women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bhasin |first=Tanushree |url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/artbeat/south-asias-organic-brand-of-modernism |title=South Asia's organic brand of Modernism |work=Sunday Guardian |date=7 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105231610/http://www.sunday-guardian.com/artbeat/south-asias-organic-brand-of-modernism |archivedate=5 November 2013 |accessdate=5 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He visited Palestinian camps in Syria and Jordan in 1970 and made 60–70 paintings of the refugees there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zaman |first=Mustafa |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2004/12/04/cover.htm |title=The Artist of People's Struggle |work=Star Weekend Magazine |location=Dhaka |date=24 December 2004 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105174419/http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2004/12/04/cover.htm |archivedate=5 January 2016 |accessdate=5 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also painted the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]] that devastated the then East Pakistan.&lt;ref name="dawn776951"/&gt;

==Liberation movement==
[[Image:Joynul Tomb.A.M.R.jpg|thumb|Abedin's tomb]]
He was involved in the [[Bengali Language Movement]] of East Pakistan.&lt;ref name="indianexpress"/&gt; Abedin was involved in the [[Bangladesh liberation war]] movement. He was at the forefront of the cultural movement to re-establish the [[Bengal]]i identity, marginalized by the [[Pakistan]] government. In 1969, Abedin painted a scroll using [[Chinese ink]], watercolor and wax named [[Nabanna (painting)|Nabanna]]. This was to celebrate the ongoing non-cooperation movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Post-independence era==
In 1974 he received Honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] degree from the [[University of Delhi]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/mad-genius/zainul-abedin-157657 |title=Zainul Abedin |work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |location=Dhaka |date=16 October 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118081856/http://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/mad-genius/zainul-abedin-157657 |archivedate=18 January 2016 |accessdate=18 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he founded the Folk Art Museum at [[Sonargaon]] in [[Narayanganj]], and Zainul Abedin Sangrahashala, a gallery of his own works in [[Mymensingh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/entertainment/2013/dec/28/shilpacharya-zainul-abedin%E2%80%99s-100th-birthday-today |title=Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin's 100th birthday today |work=[[Dhaka Tribune]] |location=Dhaka |date=28 December 2013 |accessdate=18 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, 17 of the 70 pictures housed in Zainul Abedin Sangrahashala were stolen. Only 10 were later recovered. His famous painting "Study of a Crow" (Ink Wash) in the collection of Professor Ahmed Ali is listed in the book 'Arts in Pakistan" by Jalaluddin Ahmed, 1952, including an exclusive monologue on him published by FOMMA, [[Karachi]], along with his many Famine Series paintings of 1943.

==Personal life and death==

Abedin was married to Jahanara Abedin.&lt;ref name="star56215"/&gt; He developed lung cancer and died on 28 May 1976 in Dhaka. ''Two faces'' was his last painting, completed shortly before his death.&lt;ref name="Alom193873"/&gt; He was buried beside the Dhaka University Central Mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theindependentbd.com/printversion/details/28382 |title=Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin's birth centenary today|work=[[The Independent (Bangladesh)|The Independent]] |location=Dhaka |date=29 December 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105180040/http://www.theindependentbd.com/printversion/details/28382 |archivedate=5 January 2016 |accessdate=18 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
