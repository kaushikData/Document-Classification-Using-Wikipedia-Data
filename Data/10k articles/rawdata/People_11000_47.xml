'''Andrés Soriano Sr.''' (February 8, 1898 – December 30, 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Don Andres Soriano|journal=The Philippine Folio|date=30 December 1990|url=http://www.philippinefolio.com/contdetail.php?id=17&amp;id_app2=201&amp;id_app3=01056|accessdate=30 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012033040/http://www.philippinefolio.com/contdetail.php?id=17&amp;id_app2=201&amp;id_app3=01056|archive-date=2013-10-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Filipino people of Spanish ancestry|Spanish Filipino]] industrialist. Described by the New York Times as "one of the most dominant business personalities in the western Pacific area,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Andres Soriano, Industrialist, 66|journal=The New York Times|date=31 December 1964|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/12/31/andres-soriano-industrialist-66.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was best known for expanding the original [[San Miguel Brewery]] that became [[San Miguel Corporation]]. He also established [[Philanthropy|philanthropies]] and encouraged good employee relations by sharing profits with his more than 16,000 employees by establishing a [[pension plan]] that paid retired employees 25% of their salary, with guaranteed sick leaves and medical benefits. He was the founder of [[Philippine Airlines]], Asia's first air carrier. In 1935, during [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]] era, Soriano established Commonwealth Insurance Company, a [[non-life insurance]] company.

==Family==

Andrés Soriano y Róxas was born on February 8, 1898, in [[San Miguel, Manila]], [[Philippines]]. His father, Don Eduardo Soriano y Sanz, was a Spanish engineer who migrated to Philippines in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Batalla|first=Eric Vincent C.|title=Governance and Development of the Philippine Family Conglomerate: The Case of the Soriano Business Family, 1918-1998|journal=DLSU-University Research Coordination Office|year=2000|url=http://serp-p.pids.gov.ph/details.php?pid=4109&amp;param=|access-date=2013-08-29|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130829100748/http://serp-p.pids.gov.ph/details.php?pid=4109&amp;param=|archive-date=2013-08-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother, Doña Margarita Róxas de Ayala y Róxas, was the daughter of Pedro Pablo Róxas, and the granddaughter of Antonio de Ayala and Doña Margarita Róxas, progenitors of the prominent Róxas de Ayala and [[Zobel de Ayala family|Zóbel de Ayala]] clans. Soriano was a second cousin of siblings, Col. Jacobo Zóbel (father of [[Enrique J. Zobel]]), Alfonso Zóbel de Ayala (father of [[Jaime Zobel de Ayala]]), Mercedes Zóbel McMicking and the artist [[Fernando Zóbel de Ayala y Montojo|Fernando Zóbel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=M. Henares Jr|first=Hilarion|title=Don Andres Soriano|journal=Philippines Folio|date=30 December 1990|url=http://www.philippinefolio.com/contdetail.php?id=17&amp;id_app2=201&amp;id_app3=01056|access-date=2013-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012033040/http://www.philippinefolio.com/contdetail.php?id=17&amp;id_app2=201&amp;id_app3=01056|archive-date=2013-10-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soriano had three siblings, including sisters, Carmen and Margarita.

Soriano was married to Carmen Montemar in 1924. The couple had two sons, José María Soriano (born on February 6, 1925), and [[Andres Soriano Jr.]] (born on May 3, 1926).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andres Soriano Jr., 58, Dies; Was Philippine Industrialist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/20/obituaries/andres-soriano-jr-58-dies-was-philippine-industrialist.html|accessdate=29 August 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 March 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===San Miguel Corporation===

In 1920, the 22-year-old Soriano joined the original [[San Miguel Corporation|San Miguel Brewery]] as an accountant. In six months, he became acting manager. By 1924, he was its general manager, and in 1931, at the age of 33 he was elected as its president.

During his incumbency, the San Miguel expanded beyond brewery and began to bottle [[Royal Tru]]-Orange and [[Coca-Cola]], manufacture [[Magnolia Ice Cream|Magnolia ice cream]] and dairy products, carbonic acid, dry ice and [[Fleischmann's Yeast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=M. Henares Jr.|first=Hilarion|title=Don Andres Soriano|journal=Philippine Folio|date=30 December 1990|page=1|url=http://www.philippinefolio.com/contdetail.php?id=17&amp;id_app2=201&amp;id_app3=01056|accessdate=30 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012033040/http://www.philippinefolio.com/contdetail.php?id=17&amp;id_app2=201&amp;id_app3=01056|archive-date=2013-10-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A. Soriano Corporation (ANSCOR)===

In the 1930s, Soriano established [[ANSCOR|A. Soriano Corporation]] (ANSCOR) as a holding company for his investments outside of San Miguel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANSCOR - About us|url=http://www.anscor.com.ph/aboutus/aboutus.html|work=ANSCOR Official website|publisher=ANSCOR|accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, ANSCOR concentrated on natural resources and basic industries, investing in Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation, [[Phelps Dodge]] Philippines and Atlas Fertilizer Corporation. ANSCOR also went into insurance;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Soriano Y Cia, Service Economic Reports|year=1958|publisher=World Trade Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[gold mining]] (Antamok Mining, which together with the companies of John Hausserman and Jan Hendrik Marsman, made the Philippines second only to California as the top gold producer of the world); oil exploration (Philippine Oil Development Company, Inc.); airline ([[Philippine Airlines]]); [[copper mining]] (Atlas Consolidated); copper wire manufacture ([[Phelps Dodge]] Philippines); [[fertilizer]] from pyrite (Atlas Fertilizer); [[logging]] and [[lumber]] (Bislig Bay Lumber); [[Paper mill|paper manufacture]] (Paper Industries Corporation (PICOP)); [[fluorescent lamps]] and [[incandescent light bulb]]s (Philippine Electrical Manufacturing Company (PEMCO)); [[Gunny sack|jute bags]] (Industrial Textiles Manufacturing Company of the Philippines, Inc. (ITEMCOP)); steel drums ([[Rheem]] Philippines); newspapers (''The Philippines Herald'') and broadcasting ([[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|DZTV Channel 13]]). Atlas Consolidated grew to be the largest copper mine of its time in the Far East and one of the ten largest copper mines in the world.

==Citizenship==
He was a Spanish citizen and leader of the [[Philippine Falange]] during the late 1930s until he applied for [[Philippines|Filipino]] citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Friend. Between two empires: the ordeal of the Philippines, 1929-1946. Yale University Press, 1965. Pp. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

After becoming a Filipino citizen, Soriano served as secretary of finance, agriculture and commerce during the [[Manuel L. Quezon#Administration and Cabinet|wartime cabinet of the Quezon administration]].&lt;ref&gt;Nick Cullather. ''Illusions of influence: the political economy of United States-Philippines''. Pp. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Soriano also served with [[USAFFE]] and later as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] on [[Douglas MacArthur|General Douglas MacArthur’s]] staff in the [[Southwest Pacific Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Abstract, Harry Walter Colmery|year=1979|publisher=Overview of the Collection Repository Kansas State Historical Society|location=USA|page=3|url=http://www.kshs.org/research/collections/documents/personalpapers/findingaids/colmery_harry_collection.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was granted American citizenship for his wartime services and remained an American citizen until his death.

==Death==

Soriano died on December 30, 1964 at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1964/12/31/andres-soriano-industrialist-66.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2003, he was sentenced to three [[life term]]s for three murders, but he may have killed up to nine people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Association|first1=Press|title=Camden Ripper must never be released, judge rules|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/may/14/camden-ripper-never-released-judge|accessdate=25 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Burton upon Trent]], [[Staffordshire]], [[England]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.burtonmail.co.uk/Burtonborn-killer-told-die-prison/story-21497844-detail/story.html|title=Burton-born killer told he will die in prison|date=18 May 2010|work=Burton Mail}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy had an apparently uneventful childhood and excelled in school and college. He earned an [[engineer's degree]] from [[Imperial College London]] and subsequently became a manager of a large company.&lt;ref name="C"/&gt; Hardy married and fathered three sons and one daughter; his wife divorced him in 1986, accusing him of [[domestic violence]]. In 1982, Hardy was arrested in [[Tasmania]] for trying to drown his wife, but the charges were later dropped.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;[http://www.camden.gov.uk/zoom/ccm/cms-service/stream/asset/?asset_id=301126]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the divorce, Hardy spent time in [[mental hospital]]s, diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell |first=Rachael |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/anthony_hardy/2.html |title=Anthony John Hardy, England's famous Camden Ripper |publisher=The Crime library |date= |accessdate=17 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403090108/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/anthony_hardy/2.html |archivedate=3 April 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in various [[hostel]]s in [[London]], picking up convictions for theft&lt;ref name="C"/&gt; and being [[drunk and disorderly]]. He was arrested in 1998 when a [[prostitute]] accused him of [[rape|raping]] her, but the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. He became an [[alcoholic]] and [[diabetes|diabetic]].&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;

==Murders==
In January 2002, police were called to the block of flats where Hardy lived by a neighbour complaining that someone had [[vandalism|vandalised]] her front door and that she strongly suspected Hardy. When the police investigated Hardy's flat, they found a locked door and, despite his claims to the contrary, found that Hardy had a key to it. In the room the police found the naked dead body of a woman lying on a bed with cuts and bruises to her head. She was identified as Sally White, 38, a prostitute who had been living in London.

[[Forensic pathology|Forensic pathologist]] [[Freddy Patel]] subsequently concluded that White had died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], in spite of the circumstances. Patel later came under scrutiny for this and other findings in his career, including the 2009 [[death of Ian Tomlinson]], resulting in a suspension from the government's register of pathologists pending an inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Paul Lewis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/11/g20-pathologist-ian-tomlinson |title=Pathologist in Ian Tomlinson G20 death case was reprimanded over conduct |work=The Guardian |date=11 April 2009 |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/5749486/Officer-under-investigation-over-Ian-Tomlinsons-death-should-not-have-been-working-for-Met.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628185659/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/5749486/Officer-under-investigation-over-Ian-Tomlinsons-death-should-not-have-been-working-for-Met.html |archivedate=28 June 2010 |title=Officer under investigation over Ian Tomlinson's death 'should not have been working for Met' |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=28 June 2010 |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, his name was erased from the medical register by the [[General Medical Council]], meaning that he can no longer practise medicine in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19355106 |publisher=BBC News |date=23 August 2012 |title=Ian Tomlinson pathologist Dr Freddy Patel struck off |accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal damage and claimed he had no knowledge of how White came to be in his flat due to his drinking problem. Whilst in custody Hardy was transferred to a psychiatric hospital, under section 37 of the [[Mental Health Act 1983]], remaining there until November 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Review into the Care and Treatment of  Mr Anthony Hardy Sept 2005|url=http://www.camden.gov.uk/ccm/cms-service/stream/asset/anthony-hardy-september-2005.pdf?asset_id=301126|website=Camden Government|publisher=Gov.UK|accessdate=2 August 2015|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and trial==
On 30 December 2002, a [[homeless]] man scavenging for food in bins found some of the [[dismemberment|dismembered]] remains of two women, stuffed into bin-liners. The victims were identified as Bridgette MacClennan, 34, and Elizabeth Valad, 29. The investigation led to Hardy, who was arrested a week later. He had gone on the run, but was spotted by an off-duty policeman when he went to [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] to collect his prescription for [[insulin]]. During a search of the grounds of the hospital, Hardy was found hiding behind bins. A fight took place as he resisted arrest, during the course of which a police officer was knocked unconscious and another officer was stabbed through the hand and had his eye socket dislocated. Despite suffering these injuries, the wounded police officer held Hardy until backup arrived and he was arrested at the scene. A subsequent search of his flat found evidence, including old blood stains, indicating the two women had been killed and dismembered there. Both had died over the [[Christmas]] holidays.

Under arrest, Hardy simply replied "no comment" to every question put to him by police. He was eventually charged with the murders of both MacClennan and Valad, and of White, the woman whose death had originally been put down to natural causes. At his trial in November 2003 Hardy, despite his initial lack of cooperation with the police, abruptly changed his plea to [[guilty plea|guilty]] to all three counts of murder and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. Because of Hardy's history of psychiatric problems and violent behaviour, an independent enquiry was announced into his care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nclondon.nhs.uk/newsroom/press_releases_2004/independent_review_into_the_care_and_treatment_of_Anthony_Hardy.shtm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012125439/http://www.nclondon.nhs.uk/newsroom/press_releases_2004/independent_review_into_the_care_and_treatment_of_Anthony_Hardy.shtm|archivedate=12 October 2007 |title=Independent Review Into The Care And Treatment Of Anthony Hardy |publisher=Nclondon.nhs.uk |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that police believe Hardy is possibly connected to the unsolved cases of two prostitutes found dismembered and dumped in the [[River Thames]], and up to five or six other murders that bore marked similarities to the ones for which he was convicted, but where not enough evidence is available directly implicating him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell |first=Rachael |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/anthony_hardy/7.html |title=Anthony John Hardy, England's famous Camden Ripper — Connections|publisher=Trutv.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hardy has been diagnosed with a [[personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="Sky"/&gt; In May 2010, a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judge decided that Hardy should never be released from prison, placing him on the list of [[whole life tariff]] prisoners. Mr Justice Keith, sitting in London, said: "This is one of those exceptionally rare cases in which life should mean life."&lt;ref name="Sky"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/779866/camden-ripper-will-never-be-let-out |title=Camden Ripper: Anthony Hardy Will Never Be Released Decides Mr Justice Keith After Three Murders |first=Damien |last=Pearse |work=Sky News |date=14 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=6 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009124159/http://news.sky.com/story/779866/camden-ripper-will-never-be-let-out |archivedate=9 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
Hardy was the subject of an episode of ''Evil Up Close'' on the [[Crime and Investigation Network]], focusing on the 2010 decision to keep Hardy in prison for the rest of his life. The film was directed by Robert Murray and written and produced by [[Will Hanrahan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/shows/evil-up-close/new-episodes.html |title=New Episodes - Evil Up Close on Crime and Investigation Network |publisher=Crimeandinvestigation.co.uk |date= |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hardy was imprisoned British [[Rapping|rap]] artist [[Plan B (singer)|Plan B]] released a song about Hardy, dubbing him the 'Camden Ripper'. Hardy is also mentioned, and his flat pointed out, in the music video "Guided tour of Camden" by [[Charlie Sloth]]. Hardy was the subject of a Channel 4 documentary, ''The Hunt for the Camden Ripper'', broadcast in 2004. It was narrated by [[Juliet Stevenson]] and directed by Olly Lambert.

[[File:Armenoid Armenian.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[Armenians in Syria|Syrian Armenian]] man of Armenoid type, from ''The Races of Europe: A Sociological Study'' by [[William Zebina Ripley]] (1911)]]
In the [[Scientific racism|racial anthropology]] of the early 20th century, the '''Armenoid type''' is a subtype of the [[Caucasian race]].&lt;ref name="Ripley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ripley|first=William Z.|authorlink=William Z. Ripley|title=[[The Races of Europe (Ripley)|The Races of Europe: A Sociological Study]]|year=1899|publisher=[[D. Appleton &amp; Company]]|page=444}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to anthropologist [[Carleton S. Coon|Carleton Coon]],&lt;sup&gt;questionable source&lt;/sup&gt; the countries of the northern part of [[Western Asia]], namely [[Anatolia]]/[[Asia Minor]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Iran]], [[Upper Mesopotamia]] and the [[Levant]], were considered the center of distribution of the Armenoid race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://img819.imageshack.us/img819/4152/troeracemap.jpg|title=Carleton Coon, "Racial Distribution map"|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Prominent [[Nazism|Nazi]] and racial theorist [[Hans F. K. Günther]] used the term '[[Near Eastern]] race' to describe the Armenoid type, and ascribed Near Eastern characteristics to several contemporary peoples, including:  [[Armenians]], [[Jews]], [[Greeks]], [[Georgian people|Georgians]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Syrians]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan E Steinweis. ''Studying the Jew: Scholarly Antisemitism in Nazi Germany''. Harvard University Press, 2008. P. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Günther regarded Jews as people of multiple racial origins but defined the Near Eastern race as their major basis, and described the race's characteristics such as its "commercial spirit" and as being "artful traders" who had strong psychological manipulation capacities that helped their trade, as well as being known to exploit people.&lt;ref&gt;Alan E Steinweis. ''Studying the Jew: Scholarly Antisemitism in Nazi Germany''. Harvard University Press, 2008. P. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Günther's conception has been criticized for [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Alan E Steinweis. ''Studying the Jew: Scholarly Antisemitism in Nazi Germany''. Harvard University Press, 2008. P. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazism|Nazis]] historically identified [[Jews]] as within the Armenoid type in the name of the Near Eastern race.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell B. Hart. Jews &amp; Race: Writings on Identity &amp; Difference, 1880-1940. Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA: Brandeis University Press, 2011. P. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazism|Nazis]] utilized the Armenoid type in the name of the Near Eastern race, and identified [[Jews]] as a particular group within that type.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell B. Hart. Jews &amp; Race: Writings on Identity &amp; Difference, 1880-1940. Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA: Brandeis University Press, 2011. P. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiognomy==
[[File:Armenoid Lebanese.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] man of Armenoid type, from Ripley (1911)]]
[[Renato Biasutti]] described the Armenoid race as having: "Opaque-white skin, [[brown hair|brunet hair]] and [[eye color#Brown|eyes]], abundant pilosity; medium stature (166), sturdy body build; wide head with rounded occiput (87); very long face, straight and narrow nose (57) with high bridge; thin lips, narrow eye opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dienekes.110mb.com/texts/biasutticaucasoid/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511091339/http://dienekes.110mb.com/texts/biasutticaucasoid/ |archivedate=2012-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Carleton S. Coon]] wrote that the Armenoid racial type is very similar to the [[Dinaric race]], most probably due to racial mixture with the [[Mediterranean race|Mediterraneans]] (who often have [[olive skin]]) and the [[Alpine race|Alpines]] (who often have brown skin). The only difference is that Armenoids have a slightly darker [[pigmentation]]. He described the Armenoid as a sub-race of the [[Caucasian race|Caucasoid race]].
Armenoids were said to be found throughout [[Eurasia]]. However, the largest concentrations occurred within [[Anatolia]], [[South Caucasus|Transcaucasia]], [[Iran]], and [[Mesopotamia]]. 

Considered to be the "true" [[Caucasus|Caucasians]], Armenoids were relatively tall, usually with [[Brown hair|medium to dark brown]] or [[black hair]], light to medium skin colour, large round eyes that were usually brown; a round, brachycephalic head shape with a straight backing (planocciput) (see [[Cephalic index]]), high cheekbones and non-prominent chins. Lips were full, and noses were often [[aquiline nose|aquiline]]. Large minority of Armenoids have [[blond]] hair and [[eye color#Blue|blue]], [[eye color#Green|green]], or hazel eyes. This racial type was believed to be prevalent among the [[Armenians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], and [[Iraqi people|Iraqis]].&lt;ref name=WBF&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=William B.|authorlink=William Bayne Fisher|title=The Middle East and North Africa, Volume 50|year=2003|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-85743-184-1|page=444|quote=The northern and eastern hill districts [of Iraq] contain many racial elements—Turkish, Persian, and proto-Nordic, with Armenoid strains predominating. [..] the population of the riverine districts of Iraq displays a mixture of Armenoid and Mediterranean elements. North of the Baghdad district the Armenoid strain is dominant.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WBF2&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=William B.|authorlink=William Bayne Fisher|title=The Middle East: A Physical, Social and Regional Geography|year=1966|publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]]|isbn=978-0-416-71510-1|page=96|quote=Armenoid affinities are easily discerned in the peoples of northern and central Iraq.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pP315Mw3S9EC}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pP315Mw3S9EC&amp;pg=PA444 extract of page 444]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Distribution==
The Armenoid race type exists to the west and north of the [[Arabid race]], and encompasses the modern Armenians, Assyrians, [[Maronite]]s, [[Greeks]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Kurds]], [[Georgians]], Iranians, [[Israelis]], [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]], [[Druze]], [[Yazidi]]s, [[Shabaks]], [[Mandeans]] and [[Mhallami]],&lt;ref&gt;Review: An Introduction to the Anthropology of the Near East by C. U. Ariëns Kappers, American Anthropologist, 37(35) - Pages 148-49 by W.M. Krogman&lt;/ref&gt; together with the ancient ancestors and/or predecessors of these peoples, such as the Assyrians, [[Akkadians]], [[Babylon]]ians, [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Eblaites]], [[Amorites]], [[Canaan]]ites, [[Kassites]], [[Gutians]], [[Hittites]], [[Hattians]], [[Hurrian]]s, [[Phrygia]]ns, [[Lydia]]ns, [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Carthaginia]]ns, [[Medes]], Persians, [[Scythian]]s,  [[Israelite]]s, [[Samaritan]]s, [[Judean]]s, [[Edomite]]s, [[Moab]]ites, [[Ammonite]]s, [[Philistine]]s, [[Cilician]]s, [[Cappadocian]]s and [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hourani|first=Albert H.|authorlink=Albert Hourani|title=Syria and Lebanon: A Political Essay|year=1946|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|It has long been believed by physical anthropologists that the quintessence of Near Eastern brachycephaly is to be found in the Armenians; the racial term Armenoid being named for them. The Armenians have long been established in the territory which is now only partly theirs; they had, before the arrival of the Turks, a powerful kingdom, which covered most of the territory between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;The Races of Europe by Carleton Stevens Coon - (Chapter XII, section 18)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Types==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
The Armenoid is divided into four types: Armenid, Anatolid, Assyrid, and Caucasid.

'''Assyrid''' - [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Levant|Levantine people]], [[Ashkenazi Jews]], [[Sicilians]], and the [[Maltese people]] belong to this type. Assyrids are of middling height and generally have a medium build. They are usually considered to have a slight Arabid influence.

'''Caucasid''' - Robust type prevalent among the people of the [[Caucasus]], such as in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Turkey (country)|Turkey]], and even [[Sicily]].

'''Bashir Shihab II''' (also spelt "'''Bachir Chehab II'''"; 2 January 1767&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=el Khazen|first=Melek|url=http://www.khazen.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=620&amp;Itemid=185|title=The Khazens and the Shihabs (1697-1840)|publisher=De Khazen|accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;ndash;1850)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bashīr Shihāb II|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bashir-Shihab-II|website=Britannica|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Lebanese [[emir]] who ruled [[Ottoman Lebanon|Lebanon]]{{clarify|date=October 2014}} in the first half of the 19th century. Born in a family who had converted from [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Islam]], the religion of previous Shihabi Emirs, he was the only [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] ruler of the [[Mount Lebanon Emirate|Emirate of Mount Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Ogp94y8CJgC&amp;pg=PA283|title=''The Maronites in history'', Matti Moosa, p283|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
{{See also|Shihab dynasty}}

Bashir was born in 1767 in [[Ghazir]],&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Etheredge|first1=Laura S.|title=Syria, Lebanon and Jordan|date=2011|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|isbn=9781615303298|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salibi58"&gt;Salibi 1992, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; a village in the [[Keserwan]] region of [[Mount Lebanon]]. He was the son of Qasim ibn Umar ibn Haydar ibn Husayn Shihab of the [[Shihab dynasty]],&lt;ref name="Farah766"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 766.&lt;/ref&gt; which had inherited the super tax farm of Mount Lebanon, also known as the [[Mount Lebanon Emirate]], from their [[Druze]] kinsmen, the [[Maan family|Ma'an dynasty]] in 1697. Although the Shihab family was ostensibly [[Sunni Muslim]], some members of the family had converted to the [[Maronite Church|Maronite Catholic Church]]. Bashir was among the first members of his extended family to be born a Christian.&lt;ref name="Khairallah83"&gt;Khairallah 1996, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1768, when Bashir was still an infant, his father Qasim died.&lt;ref name="Farah766"/&gt; Bashir's mother remarried, and he and his elder brother Hasan were entrusted to the care of tutors and nannies.&lt;ref name="Salibi58"/&gt; The children were raised in poverty and did not benefit from the privileges of a princely birth;&lt;ref name="Salibi58"/&gt; their branch of the family was relatively poor.&lt;ref name="Khairallah83"/&gt; Bashir and Hasan developed feelings of mistrust from their childhoods that made them wary of their companions and of members of their own family.&lt;ref name="Salibi58"/&gt; Leadership of Qasim's branch of the family was taken up by Hasan. The latter had a reputation for being cruel and aloof.&lt;ref name="Salibi58"/&gt; Bashir, meanwhile, grew to become a cunning, stubborn and clever opportunist who was more able to control his temper and conceal his callousness.&lt;ref name="Salibi58"/&gt; He sought out wealth working with his cousin [[Yusuf Shihab|Emir Yusuf]] in [[Deir al-Qamar]], the virtual capital of Mount Lebanon, where he also gained an education.&lt;ref name="Khairallah83"/&gt; Bashir's personal qualities established him as a leading figure in the Shihabi court where he engaged in political intrigues. His activity in Deir al-Qamar attracted the attention of Qasim Jumblatt, Yusuf's main adversary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Rustum |first=A.J. |editor-last=Bearman |editor-first=P. |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam |title=Bas̲hīr Shihāb II |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/bashir-shihab-ii-SIM_1259 |edition=Second |year=1960 |publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sought to install Bashir at the head of the Emirate.&lt;ref name="Salibi59"&gt;Salibi 1992, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; When probed on the subject by the [[Jumblatt]] sheikhs, Bashir was noncommittal but left room for negotiations; his hesitance was a result of his financial destitution.&lt;ref name="Salibi59"/&gt;

===Marriages and children===
Bashir II's financial fortunes changed in 1787 when he was dispatched to [[Hasbaya]] to inventory the assets of Yusuf's maternal uncle,&lt;ref name="Salibi59"/&gt; Bashir ibn Najm,&lt;ref name="Khairallah125-26"&gt;Khairallah 1996, pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Najm Shihab, leader of the Sunni Muslim, Hasbaya-based branch of the clan.&lt;ref name="Khairallah125-26"/&gt; Yusuf killed Bashir ibn Najm for backing the revolt against him led by Yusuf's brother Ahmad.&lt;ref name="Salibi59"/&gt; During Bashir II assignment in Hasbaya, he married Bashir ibn Najm's wealthy widow, Shams.&lt;ref name="Salibi59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khairallah125-26"/&gt; She was also known as "Hubus" and "Shams al-Madid", the latter of which translates in [[Arabic]] as "sun of the long day".&lt;ref name="Khairallah125-26"/&gt; Bashir II had previously encountered Shams on a hunting trip to [[Kfar Nabrakh]], but at the time she was arranged by her father, Muhammad Shihab, to be married to Bashir ibn Najm, his nephew.&lt;ref name="Khairallah125-26"/&gt; With the latter, Shams had a son named Nasim and a daughter named Khadduj.&lt;ref name="Khairallah125-26"/&gt; Although Bashir II was a Christian and Shams was a Muslim, members of the Shihab family typically married within the family and with the Druze Abu'l Lama clan, regardless of religion.&lt;ref name="Mishaqa23"&gt;Mishaqa, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his marriage to Shams, Bashir II gained considerable wealth.&lt;ref name="Salibi59"/&gt; Shams later had three sons with him: Qasim, Khalil and Amin (listed in order of birth).&lt;ref name="Mishaqa23"/&gt;

In 1829, Shams died, and Bashir had a mausoleum built for her nestled in the orchards of Beit el-Din.&lt;ref name="Khairallah126"&gt;Khairallah 1996, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, a friend of Bashir from [[Sidon]] named Ibrahim al-Jawhari set out to find a new wife for Bashir.&lt;ref name="Khairallah27"&gt;Khairallah 1996, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Jawhari already knew a [[Circassians|Circassian]] slave girl named Hisn Jihan in Istanbul.&lt;ref name="Khairallah27"/&gt; She was the daughter of a certain Abdullah Afruz al-Sharkasi, but had been kidnapped by Turkish slave dealers and sold to a certain Luman Bey, who was known to have treated her like a daughter.&lt;ref name="Khairallah27"/&gt; Al-Jawhari suggested that Bashir marry Jihan. Bashir agreed, but also instructed al-Jawhari to buy her and three other slave girls in case Jihan was not to his satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Khairallah27"/&gt; In 1833, al-Jawhari brought Jihan (then aged 15) and three other slave girls, Kulhinar, Shafkizar and Maryam, to Bashir.&lt;ref name="Khairallah27"/&gt; The latter was enthralled by Jihan, married her and built a palace for her in Beit el-Din.&lt;ref name="Khairallah128"&gt;Khairallah 1996, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Jihan was a Muslim and Bashir had her convert to the Maronite Church before the marriage.&lt;ref name="Khairallah27"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dau 1984, p. 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to contemporary chroniclers of the time, Jihan was seclusive and only left her residence fully veiled, was a loving wife to Bashir, wielded significant influence over him and was reputed for her enchantment and charitable efforts with Mount Lebanon's inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Khairallah128"/&gt; She became known as ''sa'adat al-sitt'', which translates as "her excellency, the lady".&lt;ref name="Khairallah128"/&gt; Jihan had two daughters with Bashir, Sa'da and Sa'ud.&lt;ref name="Khairallah128"/&gt; The other slave girls from Istanbul were married off to Bashir's relatives or associates; Kulhinar was married to Bashir's son Qasim, Shafkizar was married to Bashir's kinsmen Mansur Shihab of Wadi Shahrour and Maryam was married to a certain Agha Nahra al-Bishi'lani of [[Salima, Lebanon|Salima]].&lt;ref name="Khairallah27"/&gt;

==Rule==
===Accession===
Bashir emerged on Mount Lebanon's political scene in the mid-1780s when he became involved in an intra-family dispute over leadership of the Shihabi emirate in 1783.&lt;ref name="Harris124"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; In that dispute, Bashir backed emirs Isma'il and Sayyid-Ahmad Shihab against Emir Yusuf, who ultimately prevailed when the powerful Ottoman governor of [[Sidon Eyalet|Sidon]], [[Jazzar Pasha|Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar]], confirmed his control of the Mount Lebanon tax farms after Yusuf promised him a bribe of 1,000,000 [[qirsh]].&lt;ref name="Harris124"/&gt; Bashir subsequently reconciled with Yusuf.&lt;ref name="Harris124"/&gt; Five years later, however, al-Jazzar attempted to collect Yusuf's promissory bribe, but payment of the large sum did not materialize, and al-Jazzar shifted his support to Yusuf's rival, Ali Shihab, Isma'il's son.&lt;ref name="Harris124"/&gt; Ali, who sought to avenge Isma'il's death in Yusuf's custody, and Yusuf mobilized their allies and confronted each other at [[Joub Jannine|Jubb Jannin]], where Yusuf's forces were routed by Ali and al-Jazzar.&lt;ref name="Harris124"/&gt; Yusuf fled to the [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripol]]i hinterland and was compelled to request the Druze landowning sheikhs to appoint his replacement.&lt;ref name="Harris124"/&gt; With the key backing of the [[Jumblatt]] clan, Bashir was selected by the Druze sheikhs to be their ''[[hakim (title)|hakim]]''.&lt;ref name="Harris124"/&gt; For the Druze sheikhs of Mount Lebanon, the ''hakim'' denoted the leader prince who served as their intermediary with the Ottoman authorities, and who nominally had political, military, social and judicial authority over their affairs.&lt;ref name="Harris 2012, p. 117"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Bashir traveled to al-Jazzar's headquarters in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], where he was officially transferred the Mount Lebanon tax farms in September 1789.&lt;ref name="Harris124"/&gt;

Meanwhile, Yusuf attempted to restore himself to the Shihabi emirate, mobilizing his partisans in [[Jubail]] and [[Bsharri]], while Bashir had the support of the Jumblatt clan (his main backer among the Druze) and al-Jazzar, who loaned him 1,000 of his [[Arnaut|Albanian]] and [[Maghreb]]i soldiers.&lt;ref name="Harris124"/&gt; Bashir's forces decisively defeated Yusuf's partisans in the Munaytara hills, but Yusuf escaped after receiving cover from the Ottoman governors of [[Tripoli Eyalet|Tripoli]] and [[Damascus Eyalet|Damascus]].&lt;ref name="Harris124"/&gt; However, Yusuf was later invited to Acre by al-Jazzar in a ruse by the latter and was virtually under arrest upon his arrival to the city.&lt;ref name="Harris124"/&gt; While al-Jazzar considered playing Yusuf and Bashir off of each other by soliciting bribes for the Mount Lebanon tax farm, Bashir managed to convince al-Jazzar that Yusuf was causing strife among the Druze clans, and al-Jazzar subsequently decided to execute Yusuf in 1790.&lt;ref name="Harris124"/&gt;

Despite prevailing over Yusuf, the Druze sheikhs of the Yazbaki faction (rivals of the Jumblatti faction) managed to lobby al-Jazzar to transfer the Mount Lebanon tax farms from Bashir to Yusuf's nephews, Qa'dan and Haydar.&lt;ref name="Harris131"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after, Jirji Baz, the ''mudabbir'' (manager) of Yusuf's sons Husayn and Sa'ad ad-Din, persuaded Qa'dan and Haydar to grant Yusuf's sons the tax farm of Jubail.&lt;ref name="Harris131"/&gt; Bashir and his ally Sheikh Bashir Jumblatt resisted this situation by successfully preventing Qa'dan and Haydar from collecting the taxes that they were mandated to deliver to al-Jazzar.&lt;ref name="Harris131"/&gt; The latter lent Emir Bashir and Sheikh Bashir his support against Baz, Yusuf's sons and their Imad (leading clan of the Yazbaki faction) and Abi Nakad backers.&lt;ref name="Harris131"/&gt; Bashir succeeded in forcibly restoring himself as ''hakim'', but by 1794, al-Jazzar again shifted his support to Baz and Yusuf's sons after Bashir apparently fleeced al-Jazzar in his tax payments that year.&lt;ref name="Harris131"/&gt; This was short-lived as al-Jazzar reverted to Bashir in 1795 after abundant complaints were raised against Baz.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 2012, pp. 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with al-Jazzar===
In 1797, Baz reestablished good offices with al-Jazzar, bringing him Yusuf's sons to pay their respects. Al-Jazzar wielded his potential support for Yusuf's sons as a way to leverage Bashir into paying more taxes or risk losing his Mount Lebanon tax farms.&lt;ref name="Harris132"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Emir Bashir decided to eliminate his Abi Nakad opponents and to that end, he conspired with the Jumblatts and Imads.&lt;ref name="Harris132"/&gt; Emir Bashir invited the Abi Nakad sheikhs to the counselor's quarters of his palace in Deir al-Qamar, where Bashir Jumblatt and the Imad sheikhs ambushed and killed all five of them.&lt;ref name="Harris132"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Makdisi35"&gt;Makdisi 2000, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a contemporary source, the killings effectively meant that the  "Nakad name was obliterated".&lt;ref name="Makdisi35"/&gt;

Relations soured between al-Jazzar and Bashir in 1799, during [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s two-month [[Siege of Acre (1799)|siege of Acre]]. Al-Jazzar had called on Bashir to contribute forces to aid Acre's defense, but Bashir disregarded the troop levy.&lt;ref name="Harris132"/&gt; Al-Jazzar was infuriated,&lt;ref name="Harris132"/&gt; and although Bashir took a strictly neutral position in the conflict, al-Jazzar accused him of sending the French troops provisions.&lt;ref name="Mishaqa47"&gt;Mishaqa 1988, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently forced Bashir to depart Mount Lebanon by sending an expeditionary force to help Baz oust Bashir from Deir al-Qamar.&lt;ref name="Harris132"/&gt; Bashir, along with Sheikh Bashir and many of his fellow Jumblatti sheikhs, left Deir al-Qamar and headed north for [[Akkar]] and the area of the [[Krak des Chevaliers]] ([[al-Husn, Syria|al-Husn]]).&lt;ref name="Mishaqa47"/&gt; Emir Bashir thereafter penned a letter appealing to the British admiral, [[Sydney Smith]], whose forces' bombardment of French troops was key in forcing the French withdrawal from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], to use his offices with the imperial Ottoman authorities to restore him to Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Mishaqa47"/&gt; Smith responded positively to his plea, docked his ship in Tripoli's port and met with Bashir, who then accompanied Smith to meet the Ottoman Grand Vizier, [[Kör Yusuf Ziyaüddin Pasha]] in [[al-Arish]].&lt;ref name="Mishaqa47"/&gt; Kör Yusuf was in al-Arish commanding the Ottoman ground army to retake Egypt from the French. Bashir informed Kör Yusuf of his situation with al-Jazzar and was treated well by the grand vizier,&lt;ref name="Mishaqa47"/&gt; who thereafter issued a decree granting Bashir fiscal authority over Mount Lebanon, [[Wadi al-Taym]], the [[Beqaa Valley]] and the [[Shia Muslim]]-dominated [[Jabal Amil]].&lt;ref name="Harris132"/&gt; As part of this arrangement, Bashir would be independent from the governors of Sidon, Tripoli and Damascus and would submit tax revenues directly to the imperial government.&lt;ref name="Harris132"/&gt; However, this major appointment was tempered by Bashir's lack of actual control over his assigned lands, which al-Jazzar had largely transferred to Yusuf's sons and Baz.&lt;ref name="Harris132"/&gt;

In 1800, Emir Bashir appealed for unity with Baz, writing to him, "How long will this fighting continue in which we lose men and our land is devastated?"&lt;ref name="Mishaqa48"&gt;Mishaqa 1988, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Baz agreed to meet Bashir in secret and the two reached a deal without al-Jazzar's knowledge, whereby Bashir would control the Druze areas of Mount Lebanon and Maronite-dominated Keserwan, while Yusuf's sons would control the northern areas, such as Jubail and [[Batroun]].&lt;ref name="Harris132"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mishaqa 1988, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Bashir promised to uphold the agreement, swearing an oath on both the [[Quran]] and the [[Gospel]].&lt;ref&gt;Mishaqa 1988, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Bashir also hired Baz to be his ''mudabbir'', replacing the Maronite Dahdah clan as his traditional provider of ''mudabbirs''.&lt;ref name="Harris132"/&gt; Al-Jazzar was outraged when the agreement became apparent, and lent his support to the Yazbaki faction against the new alliance between Baz, Emir Bashir and Sheikh Bashir Jumblatt.&lt;ref name="Harris132"/&gt; For the next four years, the Yazbakis, led by the Imad clan, sponsored a rival Shihab emir to usurp the emirate, but failed each time.&lt;ref name="Harris132"/&gt; Most of the Druze sheikhs condemned the Imad clan in 1803 and rallied to Emir Bashir.&lt;ref name="Harris132"/&gt; Al-Jazzar died in 1804 and was ultimately succeeded by his former ''[[mamluk]]'' (manumitted slave soldier), [[Sulayman Pasha al-Adil]].

===Consolidation of power===
With the relief of pressure from Sidon after al-Jazzar's death, Emir Bashir felt less reliant on Baz for maintaining power.&lt;ref name="Harris133"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Baz, meanwhile, had been asserting his influence in Mount Lebanon and often acted out of concert with Bashir,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moosa|first1=Matti|title=The Maronites in History|date=1986|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=9780815623656|page=284|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xqhrAAAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Bashir}}&lt;/ref&gt; bypassing the latter's authority.&lt;ref name="Harris133"/&gt; Baz also formed an alliance with Maronite Patriarch [[Joseph Tyan|Yusuf al-Tiyyan]], to the chagrin of the Druze sheikhs, who perceived Baz's growing power as representative of the Maronite political upswing that grew at the expense of the Druze sheikhs, many of whom (including Sheikh Bashir Jumblatt), feared Baz.&lt;ref name="Harris133"/&gt; The Druze were also offended because Baz's power derived from his sponsorship by their overlord, Emir Bashir.&lt;ref name="Harris133"/&gt; The latter too had become irate over Baz's rising influence with the Ottoman governors, and felt particularly humiliated by Baz's canceling of a land survey of Keserwan ordered by Emir Hasan (Bashir's brother) and other humilitations regarding Baz's treatment of Emir Hasan.&lt;ref name="Harris133"/&gt; Bashir arranged to have Baz killed, recruiting Druze fighters from the Jumblatti and Yazbaki factions to commit the act.&lt;ref name="Harris133"/&gt; Thus, on 15 May 1807, Baz was ambushed and strangled on his way to Bashir's residence, while Bashir's Druze partisans occupied Jubail, killing Baz's brother and capturing and blinding Yusuf's sons.&lt;ref name="Harris133"/&gt; Afterward, Bashir sent assurances of loyalty to the governors of Tripoli and Sidon. Bashir also pressured Patriarch al-Tiyyan to step down.&lt;ref name="Harris133"/&gt;

With the elimination of Baz and Yusuf's sons, Emir Bashir consolidated his rule over Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Harris134"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810, Sulayman Pasha gave Bashir a leasehold for life over the Chouf and Keserwan tax districts,&lt;ref name="Harris133"/&gt; effectively making him the lifetime ruler of Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Mishaqah57"&gt;Mishaqa 1988, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Sulayman Pasha would thereafter address Bashir in their correspondence with the honorary title of "pride of noble princes, authority over great lords, our noble son, Emir Bashir al-Shihabi".&lt;ref name="Mishaqah57"/&gt; Circumstances that restricted his power at the time were the annual tax revenues due to Sulayman Pasha and the Jumblatt clan's domination over the other Druze sheikhs, who Sheikh Bashir protected from Emir Bashir's imposition of supplementary impositions.&lt;ref name="Harris134"/&gt;

The Maronite peasantry did not have such protection from Bashir's supplementary impositions, partly due to the loss of elite Maronite figures such as Baz and Patriarch Tiyyal, as well as the decline in power of the Maronite [[Khazen]] ''muqata'jis''&lt;ref name="Harris134"/&gt; (subsidiary tax farmers,&lt;ref name="Harris 2012, p. 117"/&gt; who were effectively [[feoffment|enfeoffed feudal lords]]).&lt;ref name="Farah11"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maronite peasantry became frustrated with Emir Bashir because of the additional taxes imposed on them, while the Maronite Church was becoming increasingly angry at Emir Bashir's concealment of his Maronite Catholic faith.&lt;ref name="Harris134"/&gt; Bashir's behavior was influenced by the political environment of the time, during which the Ottoman state reasserted demonstration of its Sunni Islamic piety to counter the puritanical Sunni [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] tribesmen who embarrassed the Ottomans by wresting control of [[Mecca]] in 1806.&lt;ref name="Harris134"/&gt; In concurrence with the Ottomans' suppression of the Wahhabi revolt in 1818 and Sheikh Bashir openly presenting himself as a Sunni Muslim, Emir Bashir instructed the members of the Shihab clan to publicly observe [[Ramadan]] in order not to be undermined by his chief Druze ally.&lt;ref name="Harris134"/&gt; By publicly partaking in a Muslim holiday, Emir Bashir deeply offended the Maronite Church.&lt;ref name="Harris134"/&gt;

===Suppression of Maronite risings===
In 1819, [[Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali|Abdullah Pasha]] succeeded Sulayman Pasha as the Acre-based governor of Sidon, and upon his accession to office, he demanded extra taxes from Bashir in the form of 1,000,000 [[dirham]]s.&lt;ref name="Farah7"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Bashir understood this to be an attempt by Abdullah to foment a conflict between him and the inhabitants of Mount Lebanon, and he sought to defuse tensions with Abdullah Pasha.&lt;ref name="Farah7"/&gt; To that end, Bashir sent his ''mudabbir'' (adviser to an emir who promoted to the social rank of sheikh), Butrus Karami, to mediate his case with Abdullah, to which the latter responded by mobilizing his troops and entertaining ties with Bashir's Shihabi rivals.&lt;ref name="Farah7"/&gt; Bashir conceded to Abdullah's demand, and in order to gather funds for the payment, Bashir imposed a two-year advance on the ''[[jizya]]'' (poll tax for non-Muslims) and ''[[kharaj]]'' (land tax) on the Maronite peasants of [[Matn District|Matn]], Keserwan, Batroun and Jubail. He excluded the Druze ''muqata'jis'' from the same taxes.&lt;ref name="Harris134"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farah7"/&gt; Bashir also passed on an additional charge by Abdullah Pasha for 50,000 dirhams to the Maronite peasants.&lt;ref name="Farah7"/&gt;

In reaction to Bashir's tax levies, the Maronite patriarch [[Joseph Estephan|Yusuf Istifan]] rallied around 6,000 Maronite peasants to a summit by the [[Antelias]] stream, marking the start of the ''ammiya'' (popular uprising) movement.&lt;ref name="Harris135"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; At Antelias, the peasants agreed to reject Bashir's additional impositions, and appointed ''wukala'' (delegates; sing. ''wakil'') from each of their villages to represent their interests.&lt;ref name="Harris135"/&gt; The ''ammiya'' attracted the support of the Yazbaki chief, Ali Imad, two emirs from the Shihab clan and the Shia sheikhs.&lt;ref name="Harris135"/&gt; Abdullah Pasha, intent on removing Bashir from Mount Lebanon, also stood by the peasants in their demands not to pay anything more than the traditional annual taxes.&lt;ref name="Farah7"/&gt; Faced with this opposition, Bashir entered into self-exile to the Hauran under the protection of Damascus Eyalet's governor Dervish Pasha.  Accompanying Emir Bashir were Sheikh Bashir Jumblatt and a number of emirs from the [[Arslan family|Arslan]] and Abu'l Lama clans.&lt;ref&gt;Farah 2000, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Yazbaki faction, with Abdullah Pasha's blessing, proceeded to appoint two Sunni Muslim emirs from the [[Rashayya]] branch of the Shihab clan, Hasan and Salman, as Emir Bashir's successors on 14 April 1819.&lt;ref name="Farah8"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1820, the Ottoman Empire was entering into war with [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and attempting to quell a [[Greek War of Independence|Greek uprising in Morea]], prompting the [[Sublime Porte]] (Ottoman imperial government) to issue orders to Abdullah Pasha to fortify [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]]'s coastal cities and disarm Christians in his province.&lt;ref name="Farah8"/&gt; Abdullah Pasha believed only Emir Bashir was capable of fulfilling this task and sought to make way for his return to Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Farah8"/&gt; To accomplish this, Abdullah Pasha ordered Hasan and Salman to promptly pay him 1,100,000 dirhams, a seemingly insurmountable levy. At the same time, Emir Bashir's allies in Mount Lebanon undermined Hasan and Salman, while Emir Bashir entered [[Jezzine]], in the environs of Deir al-Qamar. Due to these factors, Hasan and Salman ultimately conceded to step down in favor of Bashir after mediation by ''[[Druze#ʻUqqāl and Juhhāl|'uqqal]]'' (Druze religious leaders).&lt;ref name="Farah8"/&gt; According to the agreement reached on 17 May 1820, a referendum would be held among the inhabitants of Mount Lebanon regarding leadership of the emirate.&lt;ref name="Farah8"/&gt; Before the referendum could be held, however, Abdullah Pasha restored Bashir's authority on the condition that he collect the ''jizya'' for the Sublime Porte.&lt;ref name="Farah8"/&gt;

The Maronite peasants and clergymen of Jubail, Bsharri and Batroun decided to take up armed resistance against Bashir's impositions, and garnered the support of the Shia Muslim Hamade sheikhs.&lt;ref name="Farah8"/&gt; The peasants proceeded to assemble at [[Lehfed]], Haqil and [[Ehmej]], while Shia villagers assembled at Ras Mishmish.&lt;ref name="Harris135"/&gt; They selected ''wukkal'' for their districts, called for fiscal equality with their Druze counterparts, and declared a revolt against Emir Bashir.&lt;ref name="Harris135"/&gt; Among the leading ''wukkal'' was historian Abu Khattar al-Aynturini, who promoted the idea that the Shihabi emirate was a conduit for Maronite solidarity.&lt;ref name="Harris135"/&gt; Emir Bashir enlisted the support of sheikhs Bashir and Hammud Abu Nakad.&lt;ref name="Harris135"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farah8"/&gt; With their Druze fighters, Emir Bashir forces the Maronites in northern Mount Lebanon to submit to his orders.&lt;ref name="Farah8"/&gt; The episode augmented the growing chasm between an increasingly assertive Maronite community and the Druze ''muqata'jis'' and peasants.&lt;ref name="Harris135"/&gt; According to historian William Harris, the "''ammiya'', which expressed discordance between Bashir II's ambition and the interests of an increasingly coherent majority community, was a major step toward modern Lebanon. It represented the first peasant articulation of identity and the first demand for autonomy for Mount Lebanon."&lt;ref name="Harris135"/&gt;

===War with Damascus and rift with the Druze===
In 1821, Bashir became entangled in a dispute between Abdullah Pasha and Dervish Pasha. The crisis was precipitated when the latter's ''[[mutasallim]]'' (deputy governor/tax collector) for the Beqaa Valley raided '[[Aammiq]], when the latter's inhabitants denied him entry into the village.&lt;ref name="Farah8"/&gt; Bashir attempted to mediate the dispute, and Dervish Pasha signaled his willingness to cede Damascus's traditional jurisdiction over the Beqaa Valley to Abdullah Pasha's Sidon Eyalet.&lt;ref name="Farah8"/&gt; Abdullah Pasha refused this offer and requested that Bashir take over the Beqaa Valley.&lt;ref name="Farah8"/&gt; Bashir accepted the task, albeit with reluctance, and under the command of his son Khalil, Bashir's forces swiftly conquered the region.&lt;ref name="Farah8"/&gt; Khalil was subsequently made ''mutasallim'' of the Beqaa Valley by Abdullah Pasha.&lt;ref name="Farah8"/&gt; In response, Dervish Pasha mobilized the support of the Yazbaki faction and a number of Shihabi emirs to reassert Damascene control over the area. However, Dervish Pasha's forces were defeated in the [[Anti-Lebanon mountains|Anti-Lebanon Range]] and in the Hauran.&lt;ref name="Farah9"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sublime Porte was troubled by Abdullah Pasha and Emir Bashir's actions against Damascus, and dispatched Mustafa Pasha, the governor of [[Aleppo Eyalet]], to reinforce Dervish Pasha and help him defeat Abdullah Pasha.&lt;ref name="Farah9"/&gt; Mustafa Pasha sent an emissary to Mount Lebanon to announce an imperial decree dismissing Bashir from the Mount Lebanon tax farms, and reappointing Hasan and Salman.&lt;ref name="Farah9"/&gt; Afterward, Mustafa Pasha, Dervish Pasha and the leaders of the Yazbaki Druze persuaded Sheikh Bashir to defect from Emir Bashir in return for replacing Hasan and Salman with Abbas As'ad Shihab, which officially occurred on 22 July 1821.&lt;ref name="Farah9"/&gt; The governors' forces, backed by the Druze, proceeded to besiege Abdullah Pasha's Acre headquarters, and Emir Bashir left Mount Lebanon for [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]] by sea on 6 August, having lost the backing of his most crucial ally, Sheikh Bashir.&lt;ref name="Farah9"/&gt; However, Emir Bashir gained a new, powerful ally in Egypt's virtually autonomous governor, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]].&lt;ref name="Farah9"/&gt; At the same time, Abdullah Pasha also requested support from Muhammad Ali, who saw in Emir Bashir and Abdullah Pasha the key to bringing Ottoman Syria under his hegemony.&lt;ref name="Farah9"/&gt; Muhammad Ali persuaded the Sublime Porte to issue pardons for Bashir and Abdullah Pasha, and to lift the siege on Acre in March 1822.&lt;ref name="Farah9"/&gt;

In return for Muhammad Ali's support, Bashir agreed to mobilize 4,000 fighters at the former's disposal upon request.&lt;ref name="Farah9"/&gt; Before returning to Mount Lebanon, Emir Bashir issued orders to Sheikh Bashir to pay a large sum of 1,000,000 piasters in return for a pardon, but Sheikh Bashir instead opted for self-exile in the Hauran.&lt;ref name="Farah10"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; From there, Sheikh Bashir began preparations for war with Emir Bashir.&lt;ref name="Farah10"/&gt; Sheikh Bashir struck an alliance with his Druze rival, Ali Imad, head of the Yazbaki faction, the Arslan clan, the [[Khazen]] sheikhs of Keserwan, and the Shihab emirs who were opposed to Emir Bashir's rule.&lt;ref name="Farah10"/&gt; With 7,000 armed supporters, Sheikh Bashir entered [[Beit ed-Dine|Beit el-Din]] in a demonstration of power to force Emir Bashir to reconcile with him.&lt;ref name="Farah10"/&gt; Emir Bashir continued to insist that Sheikh Bashir make the full payment to compensate for his betrayal, prompting unsuccessful mediation attempts by various Druze and Maronite sheikhs and Maronite bishop, Abdullah al-Bustani of Sidon. Emir Bashir and Sheikh Bashir thereafter readied for war.&lt;ref name="Farah10"/&gt;

Emir Bashir experienced a setback when he clashed with Sheikh Bashir's forces on 28 December 1824.&lt;ref name="Farah10"/&gt; However, this loss was reversed following Abdullah Pasha's dispatch of 500 [[Arnaut|Albanian]] irregulars to aid Emir Bashir on 2 January 1825.&lt;ref name="Farah10"/&gt; Upon the arrival of the reinforcements, Emir Bashir launched an attack and routed Sheikh Jumblatt's forces near the latter's headquarters at [[Moukhtara]].&lt;ref name="Farah10"/&gt; Afterward, Sheikh Bashir and Imad fled for the Hauran, and Emir Bashir pardoned enemy fighters who surrendered.&lt;ref name="Farah10"/&gt; Imad and Sheikh Bashir were subsequently captured by the forces of Damascus's governor, with Imad being summarily executed and Sheikh Bashir being sent to Abdullah Pasha's custody in Acre.&lt;ref name="Farah10"/&gt; Upon request from Muhammad Ali, who sought to ensure Emir Bashir's reorganization of Mount Lebanon went unhindered, Abdullah Pasha had Sheikh Bashir executed on 11 June.&lt;ref name="Farah10"/&gt;

===Centralization and shift to Maronite clergy===
Emir Bashir proceeded to reorganize the tax farms (virtual fiefs) of Mount Lebanon to strengthen the hand of his remaining Druze allies and deny his enemies a fiscal power base.&lt;ref name="Farah10"/&gt; As such, the Jumblatts were dismissed from the tax districts of Chouf, Kharrub, Tuffah, Jezzine, Jabal al-Rihan and the eastern and western Beqaa Valley regions, which were redistributed to Bashir's son Khalil, the Talhuqs, and Nasif and Hammud Abu Nakad.&lt;ref name="Farah10"/&gt; Furthermore, the personal residences and orchards of the Jumblatt and Imad sheikhs were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Farah10"/&gt; Bashir's campaign prompted many Druze to leave for the Hauran to escape potential retribution.&lt;ref name="Farah10"/&gt;

To centralize his rule over the emirate (as opposed to the previous bipartite regime with Sheikh Bashir), Emir Bashir proceeded to assume control over legislative and judicial powers by setting up a defined legal code based on the [[Sharia]] law of the Ottoman state.&lt;ref name="Farah11"/&gt; Moreover, he transferred jurisdiction over civil and criminal affairs from the mostly Druze ''muqata'jis'' to three special ''[[qadi|qudah]]'' (judges; sing. ''qadi''), whom he personally appointed.&lt;ref name="Farah11"/&gt; As such, he assigned a ''qadi'' in Deir al-Qamar in Chouf, who mostly oversaw the affairs of the Druze, and two Maronite clergymen who were based in Ghazir or [[Zouk Mikael]] in Keserwan and [[Zgharta]] in northern Mount Lebanon, respectively.&lt;ref name="Farah11"/&gt; Although the new legal code was based on Sharia, Bashir did not seek to overturn deeply-entrenched customary law, and the ''qudah'' typically relied on local customs in their judicial decisions, and only referred to the Sharia as a last resort.&lt;ref name="Farah11"/&gt;

Emir Bashir's alliance with Muhammad Ali and his falling out with Sheikh Bashir, under whose consent Emir Bashir had been able to rule Mount Lebanon for the preceding two decades, marked a major turning point in Emir Bashir's political career.&lt;ref name="Farah9"/&gt; Emir Bashir's loss of Druze support and his subsequent destruction of their feudal power paved the way for the strengthening of his ties with the Maronite Church.&lt;ref name="Farah11"/&gt; Moreover, Bashir looked to the Maronite clergy as the natural alternative to substitute the Druze in his new, highly centralized administration.&lt;ref name="Farah11"/&gt; Concurrently, he became more at ease with embracing his Christian faith since he no longer depended on Druze support.&lt;ref name="Harris136"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarch [[Joseph Peter Hobaish|Yusuf Hubaysh]] greatly welcomed the aforementioned developments.&lt;ref name="Harris136"/&gt;

Between 1825 and his demise in 1840, Bashir installed Maronite patriarchs, bishops, and lower-ranked priests as the principal functionaries of his administration and as advisers.&lt;ref name="Farah12"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, Maronite clergymen, who had long dominated the religious and secular aspects of Maronite life, acquired the privileges that the Druze ''muqata'jis'' had previously maintained with Bashir and his Shihabi predecessors.&lt;ref name="Farah12"/&gt; The lower-ranked clergymen in particular obtained Bashir's sponsorship to help them rise through the hierarchy of the Maronite Church in return for their support and their efforts to promote loyalty and love for Bashir among the Maronite peasantry.&lt;ref name="Farah12"/&gt; These clergymen were also at the forefront of efforts to roll back the excesses imposed on Maronite tenants from their Druze lords and the latter's influence in the tax districts in general.&lt;ref name="Farah12"/&gt; Meanwhile, the remaining Druze ''muqata'jis'' continued to serve as the leaders of a Druze community that was increasingly resentful of Maronite ascendancy at the expense of Druze power.&lt;ref name="Harris136"/&gt; As a consequence of this situation, communal tensions between the Druze and the Maronites grew further.&lt;ref name="Farah12"/&gt; Throughout this period, the Ottoman government permitted Bashir's patronage of Maronite domination in Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Harris136"/&gt;

===Peak of power under Egyptian rule===
Muhammad Ali sought to annex Syria, and as a pretext to invade the region, he published a list of complaints against Abdullah Pasha, who in turn received the support of Sultan [[Mahmud II]].&lt;ref&gt;Farah 2000, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter had the [[mufti]] of Istanbul issue a ''[[fatwa]]'' (Islamic edict) that declared Muhammad Ali an infidel, while Muhammad Ali had the [[Sharif of Mecca]] issue a ''fatwa'' that condemned Mahmud II for violating the Sharia and promoted Muhammad Ali as Islam's savior, subsequently setting the stage for [[Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–33)|war between Egypt and Istanbul]].&lt;ref name="Farah13"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the command of Muhammad Ali's son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], Egyptian forces began their conquest of Syria on 1 October 1831, capturing much of Palestine before [[Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali#Fall|besieging Abdullah Pasha]] in Acre on 11 November.&lt;ref name="Farah13"/&gt; Bashir faced a dilemma amid these developments as both Abdullah Pasha and Ibrahim Pasha sent emissaries requesting his support.&lt;ref name="Farah13"/&gt;

Bashir initially hesitated in choosing sides, but once he received word that Ibrahim Pasha was prepared to mobilize six of his regiments to devastate Mount Lebanon and its lucrative [[sericulture|silk industry]], and that Sheikh Bashir Jumblatt's sons Nu'man and Sa'id had made their way to Ibrahim Pasha's camp to pledge their allegiance, Bashir deferred to the Egyptians.&lt;ref name="Farah13"/&gt; He ultimately concluded that Muhammad Ali was stronger and more progressive than the Sublime Porte and believed he would risk losing his emirate by challenging the Egyptians.&lt;ref name="Harris136"/&gt; Moreover, his Maronite and Melkite allies also favored Egypt because of its centrality to [[eastern Mediterranean]] commerce and the religious [[egalitarianism]] of Muhammad Ali.&lt;ref name="Harris137"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, under the Sublime Porte's orders, the ''mutasallims'' of Beirut and Sidon and the ''walis'' of Tripoli and [[Aleppo Eyalet|Aleppo]] stood by Abdullah Pasha, and issued warnings to Mount Lebanon's notables to do likewise.&lt;ref name="Farah13"/&gt; Bashir attempted to rally his Druze allies and rivals, such as Hammud Abu Nakad and several Jumblatt, Talhuq, Abd al-Malik, Imad and Arslan sheikhs, to defect to Muhammad Ali.&lt;ref name="Farah13-14"&gt;Farah 2000, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they joined the Ottoman army mobilizing in Damascus under the command of the ''serasker'' (commander-in-chief), Mehmed Izzet Pasha.&lt;ref name="Farah13-14"/&gt; The latter issued a decree condemning Bashir as a rebel and replacing him with Nu'man Jumblatt.&lt;ref name="Farah14"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alignment of the major Druze clans with the Ottomans compelled Bashir to further rely on his growing Maronite power base.&lt;ref name="Farah14"/&gt; He subsequently directed Bishop Abdullah al-Bustani to appoint a Maronite military commander for each district, but to do so discreetly to avoid provoking a Druze backlash.&lt;ref name="Farah14"/&gt; The Maronite commanders were tasked with tax collection, which was traditionally the responsibility of the mostly Druze ''muqata'jis'', and to arm Maronite peasant fighters to suppress Druze dissent in Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Farah14"/&gt; Concurrently, Bashir also had the properties of the pro-Ottoman Druze ''muqata'jis'' attacked or seized.&lt;ref name="Farah14"/&gt; On 21 May 1832, Egyptian forces captured Acre. Afterward, Bashir and Patriarch Hubaysh were ordered by Ibrahim Pasha to prepare their mostly Maronite troops for an assault against Damascus.&lt;ref name="Farah14"/&gt; Bashir's troops were commanded by his son Khalil, and together with the Egyptian army, they captured Damascus without resistance on 16 June, before routing the Ottoman army at [[Homs]] on 9 July.&lt;ref name="Farah14"/&gt; Khalil had previously fought alongside Ibrahim Pasha in Acre and [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="Farah14"/&gt; Khalil and his troops also participated in the Egyptian victory at [[Konya]] in southwestern [[Anatolia]] on 27 December.&lt;ref name="Farah14"/&gt;

With Syria conquered, Muhammad Ali launched a centralization effort in the region, abolishing the [[eyalet]]s (provinces) of Damascus, Aleppo, Tripoli and Sidon (including Mount Lebanon) and replacing them with a single governorship based in Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Farah 2000, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, through his close alliance with Muhammad Ali,&lt;ref name="Harris137"/&gt; Bashir maintained his direct authority over the Mount Lebanon Emirate,&lt;ref name="Farah15"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; preventing it from being subject to the Egyptian bureaucracy that centralized power in the rest of Syria.&lt;ref name="Harris137"/&gt; Moreover, he was offered the governorship of "Arabistan" (the territories of Syria), but declined to assume leadership over the region, which was then transferred to Muhammad Sharif Pasha.&lt;ref name="Farah15"/&gt; In 1832, Muhammad Ali rewarded Bashir by extending the latter's jurisdiction to include Jabal Amil, which Bashir assigned to his youngest son Majid,&lt;ref name="Harris138"&gt;Harris 2012, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; the northern tax district of [[Koura District|Koura]] and the port cities of Sidon and Beirut.&lt;ref name="Farah16"/&gt; The latter had become the commercial outlet for Mount Lebanon's silk industry, Acre's successor as the political center of the Syrian coast and a principal residence for Egyptian officials, European consuls and Christian and Sunni Muslim merchants.&lt;ref name="Harris137"/&gt; Bashir was entrusted with police power over Mount Lebanon and the plains around Damascus.&lt;ref name="Farah16"/&gt; The expansion of his jurisdiction enriched Bashir with increased revenues to the point that his tribute from Syria was four times larger than that of Muhammad Ali.&lt;ref name="Farah16"/&gt;

As part of Muhammad Ali's centralization efforts, tax collection was official transferred from ''muqata'jis'' to the appointees of the central authorities in 1833/34.&lt;ref name="Farah15"/&gt; Bashir took advantage of this measure by confiscating the estates of the ''muqata'jis'' and assigning his relatives as the ''mutasallims'' of the various tax districts.&lt;ref name="Farah16"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he appointed Khalil to Shahhar, Qasim to Chouf, Amin in Jubail, his brother Hasan's son Abdullah in Keserwan, his cousin Bashir in Tuffah and his associate Haydar Abu'l Lama in Matn.&lt;ref name="Farah16"/&gt;

===Suppression of revolts throughout Syria===
Bashir suppressed several revolts against Muhammad Ali's conscription and disarmament policies in the mountainous regions throughout [[Syria (region)|Syria]] in the service of Ibrahim Pasha. Because of Bashir's support for Muhammad Ali, his forces and allies in Mount Lebanon were allowed to keep their arms.&lt;ref name="Farah22"/&gt; The first major revolt suppressed was the [[peasants' revolt in Palestine]],&lt;ref name="Farah22"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; during which Muhammad Ali sent orders to Bashir to advance against [[Safad]], one of the centers of the rebellion.&lt;ref name="Safi"&gt;{{Citation |first=Khaled M. |last=Safi |editor=Roger Heacock |title=Of Times and Spaces in Palestine: The Flows and Resistances of Identity |chapter=Territorial Awareness in the 1834 Palestinian Revolt |url=http://books.openedition.org/ifpo/483 |publisher=Presses de l'Ifpo |location=Beirut |year=2008 |isbn=9782351592656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Bashir led his troops toward the town, but before reaching it, he issued an ultimatum to the rebels demanding their surrender.&lt;ref name="Safi"/&gt; The rebels sent a certain Sheikh Salih al-Tarshihi to negotiate terms with Bashir, and they ultimately agreed to surrender after another meeting with Bashir in [[Bint Jbeil]].&lt;ref name="Safi"/&gt; Bashir's Druze forces under the command of his son Amin,&lt;ref name="Farah22"/&gt; entered Safad without resistance on 18 July, making way for the displaced residents from its Jewish quarter to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lieber|first1=Sherman|title=Mystics and Missionaries: The Jews in Palestine, 1799-1840|date=1992|publisher=University of Utah Press|isbn=9780874803914|page=215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mrltAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Bashir+Shihab+Safed&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=18+July}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1834 and 1835, Bashir's forces commanded by Khalil and his relatives also participated in the suppression of revolts in [[Akkar]], [[Safita]], the Krak des Chevaliers and an [[Alawite]] revolt in the mountainous region of [[Latakia]]. With the various rebellions quelled, resistance to disarmament and conscription by Muhammad Ali's administration was stifled for a few years.&lt;ref name="Farah22"/&gt;

Muhammad Ali's position in Syria was shaken again in 1838, during the [[1838 Druze revolt|Druze revolt in Hauran]], which attracted the support of the Jumblatt and Imad sheikhs of Mount Lebanon and Wadi al-Taym.&lt;ref name="Farah22"/&gt; The Shihab emirs of Hasbaya, Ahmad and Sa'd al-Din, were commissioned to put down the Druze rebels in Wadi al-Taym led by Shibli al-Uryan, while Bashir was ordered to mobilize a Christian force in April.&lt;ref name="Farah23"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Bashir acceded to Ibrahim Pasha's levy request, organizing a force under the leadership of his grandson Mahmud, which subsequently was sent to reinforce Ahmad and Sa'd ad-Din in Hasbaya. Bashir's troops were ambushed by Druze forces commanded by rival Shihab emirs, [[Bashir III|Bashir Qasim]] and Ali of [[Rashaya]].&lt;ref name="Farah23"/&gt; Khalil and his Christian troops later came to Mahmud's aid, forcing the flight of Shibli to Hauran. Khalil and Ibrahim Pasha later routed the forces of Nasir ad-Din Imad and Hasan Jumblatt in July.&lt;ref name="Farah23"/&gt; A month later, Ibrahim Pasha and Shibli negotiated an end to the revolt, whereby the Druze would be exempted from conscription, [[corvée]] and additional taxes.&lt;ref name="Farah23"/&gt; The Christians of Mount Lebanon were rewarded for their support for Ibrahim Pasha with the distribution of 16,000 rifles.&lt;ref name="Farah23"/&gt; By the revolt's end, tensions between Christians and Druze were further heightened as the two sects mostly fought on opposing sides.&lt;ref name="Farah23"/&gt;

The Ottomans and British took advantage of Egypt's severely weakened position in Syria due to the heavy loss of troops and skilled officers in the 1838 revolt.&lt;ref name="Farah23"/&gt; After two years of diplomatic wrangling between Muhammad Ali, the Ottomans, Great Britain, France, and Russia, a war effort by an Ottoman-European alliance against Muhammad Ali's control over Syria was launched.&lt;ref&gt;Farah 2000, pp. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Bashir's Druze and Christian rivals and dissidents to his rule in Mount Lebanon were courted and armed in an initiative by the British Foreign Secretary, [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Henry Palmerston]].&lt;ref name="Farah35"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; With British-Ottoman support, an alliance of sheikhs in Mount Lebanon, including the Abu Nakad, Abu'l Lama, Khazen, Shihab, Hubaysh and Dahdah clans, Khanjar al-Harfush, Ahmad Daghir, Yusuf al-Shantiri and Abu Samra Ghanim, launched a rebellion against Bashir and Ibrahim Pasha on 27 May 1840.&lt;ref name="Farah35"/&gt; Bashir managed to temporarily suppress the revolt by confiscating property from the rebels, issuing threats and offering tax reductions to uninvolved Druze sheikhs in return for their support.&lt;ref&gt;Farah 2000, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Druze did not join the revolt in its early stage due to its mostly Maronite or pro-Christian leadership based in Matn, Keserwan and the Sahil.&lt;ref name="Farah37"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; By 13 July, Bashir informed the Egyptian authorities that the revolt was suppressed, and handed over 57 of the revolt's leaders and participants, including Haydar Abu'l Lama and Fransis al-Khazen, who were exiled to [[Upper Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Farah37"/&gt; Bashir also had his sons and subordinate commanders collect the rebels' arms and redistribute most of them to his ally and kinsmen, Sa'd al-Din of Hasbaya.&lt;ref name="Farah37"/&gt;

===Fall and exile===
A European alliance consisting of Great Britain, Prussia, Russia and Austria backed the Ottomans, and through the British consul in Beirut, Richard Wood, sought to persuade Bashir to defect from Muhammad Ali in August 1840.&lt;ref name="Farah41"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; This was after Wood, who had been accorded responsibility over settling Mount Lebanon's affairs by the Ottomans, had won over Patriarch Hubaysh with guarantees that the Ottomans would respect the privileges of the Maronite Church in Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Farah41"/&gt; Bashir had previously been informed by the French consul that French expeditionary troops were set to land in Beirut to back Ibrahim Pasha, who by then maintained a force of 33,000 troops across Mount Lebanon under the command of Sulayman Pasha.&lt;ref name="Farah41"/&gt; Bashir maintained his loyalty to Muhammad Ali and rejected a total of three offers by Wood to defect to the Ottomans, including a warning by British diplomat [[John Ponsonby, 1st Viscount Ponsonby|Lord Ponsonby]] that Bashir should "make haste to return to your [duty] to the Sultan".&lt;ref name="Farah41"/&gt; The third offer by Wood came with a warning that British-Ottoman forces were on the verge of assaulting the Egyptians in Syria.&lt;ref name="Farah41"/&gt;

Meanwhile, Bashir's nephew, Abdullah Shihab of Keserwan, defected to the Ottomans,&lt;ref name="Farah41"/&gt; along with the Khazen and Hubaysh sheikhs after the Ottomans offered to compensate them and their subordinates with tax relief for their revolt against Bashir a few months prior and after realizing that French support for Muhammad Ali was limited to the diplomatic realm.&lt;ref name="Farah42"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Samra and the Maronites of Batroun, Jubail, Bsharri and Koura also defected from the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Farah42"/&gt; Allied European and Ottoman forces began the naval bombardment of Beirut on 11 September, while the forces of Bashir's cousin, Bashir Qasim of Rashaya, attacked Sulayman Pasha's forces in Beirut, Sidon and Acre.&lt;ref name="Farah37"/&gt; While Ibrahim Pasha headed for Mount Lebanon from northern Syria, allied forces set up headquarters in [[Jounieh]], north of Beirut, and began distributing weapons to Bashir Qasim's rebels.&lt;ref name="Farah37"/&gt; By 25 September, allied forces had captured Beirut, Sidon and [[Haifa]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], cutting off Egyptian sea access to Ibrahim Pasha's troops.&lt;ref name="Farah42"/&gt;

Still unable to solicit Bashir's defection, Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] issued a ''[[firman]]'' (imperial decree) replacing Bashir with Bashir Qasim on 8 October.&lt;ref name="Farah41"/&gt; After a failed attempt to woo the Druze sheikhs to his side by promising them complete control of Keserwan,&lt;ref&gt;Farah 2000, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim Pasha fled, while Bashir surrendered to the Ottomans on 11 October.&lt;ref name="Farah43"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Bashir offered the Ottomans four million piasters to be exiled to France, but his offer was rejected. Instead, he was given the choice between exile in [[Malta]] or [[London]].&lt;ref name="Farah43"/&gt; Bashir chose the former,&lt;ref name="Farah43"/&gt; and departed Beirut for Malta, bringing with him Jihan, all of his children and grandchildren, his ''mudabbir'' Butros Karama, Bishop Istifan Hubaysh, Rustom Baz and 113 retainers.&lt;ref name="Khairallah128"/&gt; After an eleven-month stay in Malta, they departed again for Istanbul.&lt;ref name="Khairallah128"/&gt; Bashir remained in Istanbul until his death in 1850. He was buried in the Armenian Church in the [[Galata]] district of the city.&lt;ref name="Khairallah128"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Bashir was the strongest of the Shihabi grand emirs, but his forty-year rule, together with outside pressures from the Ottoman imperial and provincial authorities and the European powers, caused the Shihabi emirate's undoing.&lt;ref name="Harris131"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fawaz19"&gt;Fawaz 1994, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Bashir overturned the traditional system of governance in Mount Lebanon by nearly eliminating the feudal authority of the Druze and Maronite ''muqata'jis'',&lt;ref name="Fawaz19"/&gt; the secular Maronite leadership,&lt;ref name="Harris131"/&gt; and the political strength of the Druze leadership in general, which had long formed the wellspring of the emirate's power.&lt;ref name="Fawaz19"/&gt; Bashir's rule concurrently brought about the development of sectarianism in Mount Lebanon's politics.&lt;ref name="Fawaz19"/&gt; This first manifested itself during the Maronite ''ammiya'' movement against Bashir's tax exactions in 1820,&lt;ref&gt;Farah 2000, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or with Bashir's elimination of Bashir Jumblatt and subsequent cultivation of the Maronite clergy as a new power base to replace the mostly Druze ''muqata'jis''.&lt;ref name="Fawaz19"/&gt; Jumblatt's execution endowed Bashir with undisputed political power in Mount Lebanon and was done out of political considerations, but was seen by the Druze community as an attempt by a Christian to eliminate the Druze.&lt;ref name="Fawaz19"/&gt; Popular feelings of sectarian animosity were aggravated during Egyptian rule when Bashir utilized Maronite fighters to quell Druze risings, and later used Druze fighters to suppress Maronite risings towards the end of the Egyptian period.&lt;ref name="Farah46"&gt;Farah 2000, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian William Harris summarizes that Bashir contributed to the creation of the modern state of [[Lebanon]], writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;For good or bad, and whatever his personal responsibility, Bashir II's half-century bequeathed the beginnings of modern Lebanon. These included the idea of an autonomous Lebanese entity, popular identification with sectarian community above loyalty to local lords, popular communal political representation, and sectarian tensions.&lt;ref name="Harris131"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bashir also overturned another aspect of the "social contract" in Mount Lebanon by "serving the interests of outsiders against those of his own people", according to Lebanese historian [[The Fares Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies#Leila Fawaz (2001-2012)|Leila Fawaz]].&lt;ref name="Fawaz19"/&gt; Moreover, his reliance on the Ottoman governors of Sidon and his heavy involvement in their political struggles with the other governors of Ottoman Syria turned Mount Lebanon into "a pawn of regional politics beyond its control".&lt;ref&gt;Fawaz 1994, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Caesar E. Farah]] asserts, &lt;blockquote&gt;Without the domestic schemes of Bashir, which facilitated the Egyptian occupation of Syria, the Lebanon presumably would not have become in 1840 the cockpit of the great powers. While he may not have created the question, Bashir did convert the country into the fulcrum for the disruption of Ottoman rule in the Syrian provinces. He not only ended the primacy of his house, but also prepared the country to be the apple of discord cast to the nations of the West.&lt;ref name="Farah46"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, the Shihab family (also spelled "Chehab") continue to be one of the prominent families of Lebanon.&lt;ref name="RHG"&gt;{{cite web|title=The House of Ghassan and its Legal Precedents|url=http://www.royalhouseofghassan.org/houseghassan/|website=Royal House of Ghassan|publisher=The Official Website of the Sovereign Imperial &amp; Royal House of Ghassan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third president of the Lebanese Republic, [[Fuad Chehab]], was a member of the family, descending from the Ghazir-based, Maronite line of Hasan, Bashir II's brother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malsagne|first1=Stéphane|title=Fouad Chéhab (1902-1973).

==Monuments==
One of the most remarkable Bashir's monuments is a magnificent palace in Beit ed-Dine which he started building immediately after taking power in 1788. Bashir rewarded the architect by cutting his knutts off in order to keep his palace a one-of-a-kind.  He moved his government from Deir el Qamar to Beit ed-Dine when he had executed (as a part of his many Intrigues) a popular prince and caused riots in Dar el Qamar.

The '''Buginese people''' are an ethnic group—the most numerous of the three major linguistic and ethnic groups of [[South Sulawesi]], in the southwestern province of [[Sulawesi]], third largest island of [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Peletz, Gender pluralism: southeast Asia since early modern times. Routledge, 2009. {{ISBN|0-415-93161-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Austronesian]] ancestors of the Buginese people settled on [[Sulawesi]] around 2500 B.C.E. There is "historical linguistic evidence of some late [[Holocene]] immigration of Austronesian speakers to South Sulawesi from [[Taiwan]]"—which means that the Buginese have "possible ultimate ancestry in South China", and that as a result of this immigration, "there was an infusion of an exogenous population from [[China]] or [[Taiwan]]."&lt;ref&gt;Susan G.

Despite the population numbering only around 6 million, the Buginese are a very powerful people and they have heavily influenced the politics in the present day states of Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. The sixth Prime Minister of Malaysia, [[Najib Razak]] and the current Vice President of Indonesia, [[Jusuf Kalla]] are both Buginese.

Although many Buginese people live in the large port cities of [[Makassar]] and [[Parepare]], the majority are farmers who grow wet rice on the lowland plains to the north and west of the town of [[Maros]]. The name Bugis is an [[exonym]] which represents an older form of the name; ''(To) Ugi'' is the [[endonym]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shiv Shanker Tiwary &amp; Rajeev Kumar|title=Encyclopaedia of Southeast Asia and Its Tribes, Volume 1|year=2009|publisher=Anmol Publications|isbn=81-261-3837-8|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buginese people speak a distinct regional language in addition to [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], called ''Basa Ugi'', Bugis or [[Buginese language|Buginese]]. In reality, there are several dialects, some of which are sufficiently different from others to be considered separate languages. Buginese language belongs to the [[South Sulawesi language group]]; other members include Makassarese language, [[Toraja-Sa’dan language|Torajan]], [[Mandar language|Mandar]] and [[Enrekang language|Enrekang]], each being a series of dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, R.F. 1975.

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Aru Pancana We Tenriolle koningin van Tanette (Zuid-Sulawesi) met hofdames TMnr 10001333.jpg|thumb|Aru Pancana We Tenriolle, Queen of Tanette, [[South Sulawesi]]. Pictured accompanied by court ladies.]]

===Origin===
{{see also|Bugis creation myth}}

====Homeland in Sulawesi, Indonesia====
{{One source|section|date=January 2011}}
The homeland of the Buginese is the area around [[Lake Tempe]] and Lake Sidenreng in the Walannae Depression in the southwest peninsula of Sulawesi. It was here that the ancestors of the present-day Bugis settled, probably in the mid- to late second millennium BC. The area is rich in fish and wildlife and the annual fluctuation of Lake Tempe (a reservoir lake for the [[Bila River (Indonesia)|Bila]] and Walannae rivers) allows speculative planting of wet rice, while the hills can be farmed by [[swidden]] or [[shifting cultivation]], wet rice, gathering and hunting. Around AD 1200 the availability of prestigious imported goods including Chinese and Southeast Asian ceramics and Gujerati print-block textiles, coupled with newly discovered sources of iron ore in [[Luwu]] stimulated an agrarian revolution which expanded from the great lakes region into the lowland plains to the east, south and west of the Walennae depression. This led over the next 400 years to the development of the major kingdoms of South Sulawesi, and the social transformation of chiefly societies into hierarchical proto-states.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, I. 1995.

''Land of iron; The historical archaeology of Luwu and the Cenrana valley.'' Hull: Centre for South-East Asian Studies, University of Hull.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration to other areas===

====Malay Peninsula and Sumatra====
{{One source|section|date=January 2011}}
[[File:KITLV - 90674 - Lambert &amp; Co., G.R. - Singapore - Buginese children, Singapore - circa 1890.tif|thumb|upright|Bugis children in traditional attire in [[Singapore]], circa 1890.]]

The conclusion in 1669 of a protracted civil war led to a diaspora of Bugis and their entry into the politics of the [[Malay Peninsula]] and [[Sumatra]]. The Bugis played an important role in defeating Jambi and had a huge influence in [[Sultanate of Johor]]. Apart from the Malays, another influential faction in Johor at that time was the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]]. Both the Buginese and the Minangkabau realised how the death of [[Mahmud II of Johor|Sultan Mahmud II]] had provided them with the chance to exert power in Johor. Under the leadership of [[Daeng Parani]], the descendants of two families settled on the [[Linggi River|Linggi]] and [[Selangor river]]s and became the power behind the Johor throne, with the creation of the office of the Yang Dipertuan Muda (Yam Tuan Muda), or Bugis underking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysia.or.kr/frame2.htm  "History", Embassy of Malaysia, Seoul] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430182411/http://www.malaysia.or.kr/frame2.htm |date=30 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In northern Australia====
Long before European colonialists extended their influence into these waters, the [[Makassarese people|Makassarese]], the [[Bajau]], and the Buginese built elegant, ocean-going schooners in which they plied the trade routes. Intrepid and doughty, they travelled as far east as the [[Aru Islands]], off [[New Guinea]], where they traded in the skins of [[birds of paradise]] and medicinal masoya bark, and to [[northern Australia]], where they exchanged shells, birds'-nests and [[mother-of-pearl]] for knives and salt with [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] tribes.

The Buginese sailors left their mark and culture on an area of the northern Australian coast which stretches over two thousand kilometres from [[the Kimberley]] to the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. Throughout these parts of northern Australia, there is much evidence of a significant Bugis presence.
&lt;!-- I, [[User:Alastair Haines]] vouch that other web-sources claim linguistic evidence has been published. I recommend retaining the text. A citation from a published source is very likely possible, a search should not be in vain. --&gt;
Each year, the Bugis sailors would sail down on the northwestern [[monsoon]] in their wooden ''[[pinisi]]''. They would stay in Australian waters for several months to trade and take ''trepang'' (or dried [[sea cucumber (food)|sea cucumber]]) before returning to Makassar on the dry season off shore winds.

As [[Thomas Forrest (navigator)|Thomas Forrest]] wrote in ''A Voyage from Calcutta to the Mergui Archipelago'' (1792), S.78 ff., “The Buggesses in general are a high-spirited people; they will not bear ill usage... They deserve the character given of Malays in general, by Monsieur Poivre, in his Travels of a Philosopher,  'fond of adventures, emigration, and capable of undertaking the most dangerous enterprizes'.”

==Lifestyle==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Hofdames in Bone Celebes TMnr 10003352.jpg|thumb|Bugis traditional clothing.]]
Most present-day Buginese now earn their living as rice farmers, [[merchant|traders]] or [[fishermen]]. Women help with the agricultural cycle and work in the homes.

Most Buginese people live in stilted houses, sometimes three meters (9&amp;nbsp;ft) or more off the ground, with plank walls and floors.

Many of the marriages are still arranged by parents and ideally take place between cousins. A newlywed couple often lives with the wife's family for the first few years of their marriage.

The Buginese' diet consists mainly of rice, maize, fish, chicken, vegetables, fruit and coffee. On festive occasions, goat is served as a special dish.

The Buginese people recognise [[gender in Bugis society|five separate genders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideindonesia.org/edition-66/sulawesi-s-fifth-gender-3007484 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728104208/http://www.insideindonesia.org/edition-66-apr-jun-2001/sulawesi-s-fifth-gender-3007484 |archivedate=28 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are makkunrai and oroané, which are similar to [[cisgender]] male and female respectively, as well as calabai, calalai, and bissu, which are less easily comparable to Western ideas of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Sharyon|title=It's like one of those puzzles: Conceptualizing gender among Bugis|journal=[[Journal of Gender Studies]]|date=1 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
In the early 17th century, the Minangkabau [[ulama]], Dato Ri Bandang, Dato Ri Tiro, and Dato Ri Patimang spread Islam in South Sulawesi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Naim|first=Mochtar|title=Merantau}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bugis converted from indigenous animistic practices and beliefs to [[Islam]]. A few west coast rulers converted to Christianity in the mid-16th century, but failure by the Portuguese at [[Malacca]] to provide priests meant that this did not last. By 1611, all the Makasar and Bugis kingdoms had converted to Islam, though pockets of animists among the Bugis To Lotang at Amparita and the Makasar Konja in Bulukumba persist to this day.

Because most Bugis people are devout Muslims, the [[Hajj]] is seen as a prestige by them.

==In literature==
A settlement of Bugis people in the fictional country of [[Patusan]] plays a key role in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novel ''[[Lord Jim]]''.

'''Cellou Dalein Diallo''' (born 3 February 1952&lt;ref name=Xinhua&gt;[http://www.french.xinhuanet.com/french/2004-12/15/content_56974.htm "Le nouveau PM guinéen définit des priorités de son gouvernement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718101204/http://www.french.xinhuanet.com/french/2004-12/15/content_56974.htm |date=18 July 2011 }}, Xinhua, 14 December 2004 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Guinea]]n economist and politician who was [[Prime Minister of Guinea]] from 2004 to 2006. Previously he held a succession of ministerial posts in the government from 1996 to 2004. Currently he is President of the [[Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea]] (UFDG), an opposition party.

==Background and early career==
Diallo, a member of the [[Fula people|Fula]] ethnic group,&lt;ref name=JA&gt;Cheikh Yérim Seck, [https://archive.is/20130126182721/http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_jeune_afrique.asp?art_cle=LIN07017celloollaid0 "Cellou Dalein Diallo"], ''Jeune Afrique'', 7 January 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Speaks&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=58696 "Guinea: Sacked prime minister speaks out"], IRIN, 7 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Labé]]. He studied at the [[University of Conakry]] and the [[Center for Financial, Economic and Banking Studies]] in Paris, and in 1976 he became an inspector of trade.&lt;ref name=Kankan&gt;[http://www.radio-kankan.com/PREMIERS-MINISTRES.726.0.html Short biography of Diallo and other prime ministers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223031140/http://www.radio-kankan.com/PREMIERS-MINISTRES.726.0.html |date=23 December 2007 }}, Radio Kankan {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He began working at the Bank of Foreign Trade of Guinea in 1982,&lt;ref name=JA/&gt; and from 1985 to 1995 he worked at the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea]].&lt;ref name=JA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kankan/&gt;

After briefly working at the Administration and Control of Great Projects (''l’Administration et Contrôle des Grands Projets'', ACGP),&lt;ref name=JA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kankan/&gt; Diallo joined the government in July 1996&lt;ref name=Xinhua/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kankan/&gt; as Minister of Transport, Telecommunications and Tourism. He was subsequently moved to the position of Minister of Infrastructure in October 1997, where he remained until&lt;ref name=Xinhua/&gt; he was appointed as Minister of Public Works and Transport on 12 March 1999.&lt;ref name=Presse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presse-francophone.org/francophonie/francophonie_gouvernements_guinee.htm |title=List of members of the government |accessdate=2005-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040314054836/http://www.presse-francophone.org/francophonie/francophonie_gouvernements_guinee.htm |archivedate=14 March 2004 |df=dmy-all }}, presse-francophone.org {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[UTA Flight 141]], a flight from Guinea, crashed in [[Cotonou]], Benin in December 2003, Diallo said that there was no proof that his ministry had been neglectful of safety and that he would not resign.&lt;ref&gt;"Guinea: Minister says will not resign over plane crash", Guineenews, 3 January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Diallo served for five years as Minister of Public Works and Transport before being moved to the position of Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture on 23 February 2004.&lt;ref name=Presse/&gt;

==Prime Minister==

On 9 December 2004, Diallo was appointed as Prime Minister by President [[Lansana Conté]].&lt;ref name=Xinhua/&gt;&lt;ref name=JA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IRIN&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=44625&amp;SelectRegion=West_Africa&amp;SelectCountry=GUINEA "Guinea: New prime minister finally appointed after eight-month gap"], IRIN, 10 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The position of Prime Minister had previously been vacant since April 2004 due to the resignation of [[François Lonseny Fall]].&lt;ref name=IRIN/&gt; Diallo took office as Prime Minister on 13 December.&lt;ref name=Xinhua/&gt;

Diallo—who speaks English in addition to French&lt;ref name=Group&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/445601b54.pdf "Guinea in Transition"], ''Crisis Group Africa Briefing'', number 37, 11 April 2006, pages 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;—played a role in the Conté regime.&lt;ref name=Speaks/&gt; However, allegations of corruption coupled with disagreements with Conté's top associates, particularly [[Fodé Bangoura]], the Secretary-General of the Presidency, and [[Mamadou Sylla]], a wealthy businessman, culminated in Diallo's removal from his prime minister post.&lt;ref name=Group/&gt;

On 4 April 2006, changes to the government which would have greatly increased Diallo's power were announced. These changes would have replaced a number of ministers with Diallo's own allies and would have placed Diallo personally in charge of several portfolios,&lt;ref name=Sacked&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=58666 "Guinea: Prime minister Diallo sacked in possible power struggle"], IRIN, 5 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tussle&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4881110.stm "Guinea PM fired in 'power tussle'"], BBC News, 5 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; including those of economy, finance, international cooperation, and planning.&lt;ref name=Sacked/&gt; The decree approving the changes was said to be signed by President Conté,&lt;ref name=Sacked/&gt; but it was later speculated that Conté might not have realized the significance of what he was signing at the time.&lt;ref name=Speaks/&gt; A radio broadcast announcing the changes was interrupted by soldiers, which was said to be because Fodé Bangoura had not been notified in advance.&lt;ref name=Tussle/&gt; On the next day, it was announced that Diallo's changes were reversed, and a few hours later it was announced that Diallo had been dismissed as prime minister "for serious misconduct".&lt;ref name=Sacked/&gt;

Although there were subsequently reports that Diallo had been placed under [[house arrest]], he denied this in an interview with [[IRIN]] and thanked Conté for maintaining confidence in him during his time in the government.&lt;ref name=Speaks/&gt;

==Opposition leader==

On 8 November 2007, an opposition political party, the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UFDG), announced that it had appointed Diallo as its president, succeeding [[Mamadou Ba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_2217768,00.html "Former PM joins opposition"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150129/http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0%2C%2C2-11-1447_2217768%2C00.html |date=16 November 2007 }}, Sapa, 8 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After he took office as the group's leader, Diallo said on 15 November that he believed that Conté would not run in the 2010 presidential election; he also said that he "always maintained good relations with General Lansana Conté and his family".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120716190801/http://www.afriquenligne.fr/actualites/politique/guinee:-pour-un-%22forfait%22-de-lansana-conte-en-2010-2007111611564/ "Guinée: Pour un "forfait" de Lansana Conté en 2010"], Panapress, 16 November 2007 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the appointment of [[Ahmed Tidiane Souaré]] as prime minister, Diallo was present, along with other former ministers, when Souaré gave a press conference on 22 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=78376 "Guinea: Appointment of new PM "violates" union agreement"], IRIN, 23 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May, he was one of the party leaders who met with Souaré to discuss the formation of a national unity government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apanews.net/apa.php?page=show_article_eng&amp;id_article=65118 "Guinean PM, politicians discuss formation of union govt"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, African Press Agency, 29 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conté died in December 2008 and soldiers immediately seized power in a [[2008 Guinean coup d'etat|military ''coup d'état'']]. About 20 soldiers searched Diallo's home on 1 January 2009, while holding Diallo and his family at gunpoint. According to Diallo, the search was based on suspicions that Diallo might have weapons and mercenaries as part of a coup plot, but he said that the soldiers did not take anything from his home.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hY7Ptt1CTErlmRS4IVKHIm9kfJLg "Armed officers search former Guinean PM's house"], AFP, 1 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A junta delegation met with Diallo on 2 January and condemned the search, saying that "uncontrollable elements out to hurt the junta" were to blame and that the junta had nothing to do with it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hslYf353vovyXsUqqGxM7JmB4Wrw "Guinean junta regrets armed search of former PM's house"], AFP, 2 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diallo tried to hold a meeting in [[Kerouane, Guinea|Kerouane]]&lt;!-- I believe this link &amp; spelling are correct --&gt; in June 2009, but the junta did not allow him to do so; it also would not let him stay overnight in [[Kankan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/guinean-soldiers-arrest-politician-2009080532925.html "Guinean soldiers arrest politician"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319061718/http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/guinean-soldiers-arrest-politician-2009080532925.html |date=19 March 2012 }}, Panapress, 4 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After junta leader [[Moussa Dadis Camara]] suggested in August 2009 that he might stand as a presidential candidate in the planned 2010 election, Diallo urged him not to do so, saying that the election's "transparency and reliability ... require[d] the administration's neutrality and impartiality". After spending time in France and [[Senegal]], he returned to Conakry on 13 September 2009 and was greeted at the airport by about 60,000 supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g_kebySA1W8ZJoVTp511Rx-QkVvA "Tens of thousands rally to support Guinea opposition leader"], AFP, 13 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2009, Diallo participated in a [[2009 Guinea protest|massive opposition protest]] in Conakry, which was directed against Camara's suspected aspirations to run for president in 2010. He was injured at the protest, in which soldiers opened fire on the protesters and allegedly killed 157 people;&lt;ref name=Bodies&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8287430.stm "Thousands identify Guinea bodies"], BBC News, 2 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; three of his ribs were reportedly broken.&lt;ref&gt;Saliou Samb, [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE60A0W0 "Possible candidates for Guinean PM job"], Reuters, 14 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he was barred from leaving the country for medical treatment on 30 September, but soon afterwards he was transported to [[Dakar]] aboard the Senegalese presidential plane, and from there he was flown to Paris for treatment.&lt;ref name=Bodies/&gt;

Diallo placed first in the first round of the [[Guinean presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election]], but he was defeated by [[Alpha Condé]] in the second round.

On 25 July 2015, Diallo was named as the UFDG's candidate for the [[Guinean presidential election, 2015|2015 presidential election]] at a party congress; he was also re-elected to lead the party for another five years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/guineas-former-pm-run-presidency-october-203000084.html "Guinea's former PM to run for presidency in October"], AFP, 25 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

David|title=The new international dictionary of Pentecostal and charismatic movements.|year=2002|publisher=Zondervan Pub. House|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|isbn=0310224810|edition=Rev. and expanded|editor=Stanley M. Burgess|page=367|chapter=Basham, Don Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Bible teacher and author. Born and raised in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]], Basham was raised in a [[Baptist]] home but later joined the [[Christian Church]] ([[Disciples of Christ]]) whilst at college. He became involved in the [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic renewal]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Basham, D.W., Deliver Us from Temptation. Chosen Books. 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
Basham studied at [[Midwestern State University]], [[Phillips University]] (BA) and its graduate [[seminary]] in [[Enid, Oklahoma]] (BD).

Following the reported miraculous healing of a close friend, Basham and his wife Alice experienced a [[Religious experience|spiritual awakening]] that led him to leave a career in [[commercial art]] in 1951 to enter the Christian ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Basham, D.W., Face Up with a Miracle. Whitaker House. 1967&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordained as a [[Disciples of Christ]] Minister in 1955.

==Family==
Whilst at college, he met Alice Roling who was also born and raised in Wichita Falls. They married in 1949 and had five children; Cindi, Shari, Glenn, Lisa and Laura. Cindi, one of his daughters, married Dick Leggatt who later became the President of Derek Prince Ministries.&lt;ref&gt;Basham, D.W., Deliver Us From Evil. Chosen Books. 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pastorates==
After a five-year pastorate in suburban [[Washington D.C.]], he became pastor of the Hillcrest Christian Church in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada and was later pastored East Side church in [[Sharon, Pennsylvania]].{{Citation needed|date=August  2015}}

==Itinerant Ministry==
After the publication of his first book, Basham left the pastorate in 1967 to commence a freelance writing and traveling ministry.

He travelled extensively in the US and abroad ([[Jamaica]], [[England]], [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Austria]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Hungary]], [[Israel]] and [[New Zealand]]) &lt;ref name="beyond"&gt;Basham, D.W., Beyond Blessing to Obedience, CGM Publishing, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; teaching on subjects such as the [[Holy Spirit]], deliverance, spiritual authority and [[faith]].

Basham's [[deliverance ministry]] resulted in some notoriety. In the 1970s, Basham's and Prince's teaching on deliverance and practice of public exorcisms had a significant impact on the charismatic movement.&lt;ref&gt;Smail et al., Charismatic Renewal: The Search for a Theology, SPECK, London, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian Growth Ministries==
In 1970, Basham, along with Bible teachers [[Derek Prince]], Bob Mumford, [[Ern Baxter]] and Charles Simpson, began teaching a controversial doctrine of 'spiritual covering' that required individual Christians to be submitted and accountable to a leader. They became the leaders of the [[Shepherding Movement]]. Basham submitted himself to [[Derek Prince]] as his personal shepherd.&lt;ref name="beyond"/&gt;

Together with Prince and Mumford, Basham established [https://web.archive.org/web/20061017231514/http://www.goodnewsfc.org/ Good News Church] in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Balmer, R., Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism, Baylor University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Basham later relocated with the CGM to [[Mobile, Alabama]] in 1982 when it adopted the name Integrity Communications.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess &amp; McGee (ed)., ''[[Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements]]'', Zondervan, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Basham was the editor of CGMs monthly magazine, ''[[New Wine (magazine)|New Wine]]'' from 1975 to 1981 and served as chief editorial consultant until it ceased publication in 1986. New Wine at one time was the most widely circulated Charismatic publication in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Synan (ed), The Century of the Holy Spirit: 100 Years of Pentecostal and Charismatic Renewal, Nelson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Basham wrote sixteen books and numerous articles for Christian magazines.

'''Edward Skoyles''' (14 March 1923&amp;nbsp;– 30 July 2008) was the first [[quantity surveyor]] employed in the [[UK]] to research costs and practices in the [[construction industry]]. He did his research from 1960 until 1984 at the [[Building Research Establishment]]. Among his research projects was developing a new type of [[Call for bids|tendering]] for [[construction]] projects called [[operational bills]].&lt;ref name="Skoyles66"&gt;Skoyles ER.

== Operational bills ==
[[Call for bids|Tendering]] in the UK [[construction industry]] is traditionally based upon [[Bills of quantities]] in which the [[estimating|estimation]] of costs is based on the combined cost of [[Building material|materials]], building plant and [[laborers|labour]] in the completed works.  Edward Skoyles proposed a new form of tendering, [[operational bills]] in which such tendering was based around building tasks.&lt;ref name="Skoyles66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skoyles67"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skoyles ER. (1970). Bills of quantities, or the operational bill?  ''[[Architects Journal|Architects' Journal]]''  (28 Jan.) 233-240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skoyles ER. (1981). Production orientated tendering: a resume and re-examination for the early eighties of the issues involved. Quantity surveyor, 37, (6) 110-113.&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed for the separate costing of materials, plant and labour. This offered several advantages including a more accurate ability to cost a proposed project, better communication between design and production and ease in creating [[Critical path method|critical-path analysis]] for the [[General contractor|contractor]].&lt;ref name="Shanley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="England"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dmaidi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashworth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jagger"/&gt;  A refinement of this was “bills of quantities (operations)” in which the operations are described in terms of the rules of the standard method of measurement rather than labour and materials.&lt;ref name="Skoyles68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skoyles69"/&gt; Priced-activity schedules of the [[NEC Engineering and Construction Contract]] are a modern descendent of operational bills.&lt;ref name="Potts"&gt; Potts, K.

Traditionally, the estimates for normal waste on construction sites has been 2.5-5%, however, empirical observational research done by Skoyles on 280 sites found that this underestimated it by roughly half—equivalent annually to the materials needed to build a town the size of [[Colchester]].&lt;ref name="waste76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="waste78"/&gt;&lt;ref name="waste81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="waste87"/&gt;  Further considerable variability existed between sites suggesting an opportunity for improvement.&lt;ref name="waste81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="waste87"/&gt; This work led to allowances for materials waste to be more accurately allowed for in cost estimates. As Fellows and coauthors note his work was important since: “It is interesting to postulate the possible consequences of an estimate including only one-half of the requisite materials wastage allowance, especially during a period of slump, when small profit margins prevail … anticipated profit [of 2%] is almost entirely eroded”.&lt;ref name="Fellows"/&gt;   Further, this research highlighted the need for improved education in site practices: “In the constructions industry, Skoyles was the first to recognize that the problem of material wastage was more dependent upon the attitudes and behavioral tendencies of individuals involved than upon the technical processes employed.”&lt;ref name="Hellingsworth"/&gt;

[[Image:Eppelein.jpg|thumb|Eppelein in prison.]]
'''Eppelein von Gailingen''', latinized as Apollonius von Gailingen (born c. 1315 in [[Illesheim]], [[Middle Franconia]]; died 15 May 1381 in [[Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz]]) was a famous [[Germans|German]] [[Robber baron (feudalism)|robber baron]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. 

== Life ==
Von Gailingen's date of birth is not confirmed, different sources name dates between 1300 and 1330. Starting in the 1360s he robbed merchant vehicles traveling to and from the rich merchant town of [[Nuremberg]]. In 1369, he was indicted for his robberies by the Court of Nuremberg which declared the [[imperial ban]] on him. When his castle was destroyed in 1372 Eppelein first escaped but was betrayed shortly after and captured at Forchheim.  He was sentenced to death by hanging in [[Nuremberg]].

[[File:Raubritter3.jpg|thumb|Eppelein's escape.]]
As legend tells it, when the day of the hanging came his final wish was to sit on his horse for one last time. Since the execution took place inside [[Nuremberg Castle]], the wish was granted. Eppelein took the opportunity to escape by galloping to the wall and forcing his horse to jump above it into the moat. On his flight from Nuremberg, he was met by a peasant who wanted to witness the execution of the famous robber baron and asked him if he would be in time to see the hanging. Eppelein's purportedly responded, "The Nurembergians will hang nobody - if they hadn't him before" ("''Die Nürnberger hängen keinen – sie hätten ihn denn zuvor!''").

In 1381 he was caught together with his men at a drinking feast in [[Postbauer-Heng]] and executed by [[breaking wheel]].

== Aftermath ==
The jump from the walls of Nuremberg Castle was an exciting incident at that time. In the 16th century, the first [[folk songs]] were recorded about him and gradually he became a legendary [[romantic hero]]. This was supported by the fact that 50 years after Eppelein's jump the walls were destroyed and rebuilt much more massive than before. Today markings are shown on the castle wall as remains of the jump.

'''Ethan Zohn''' (born November 12, 1973), is a former American professional [[Association football|soccer]] player, and a [[reality television]] series contestant who won $1,000,000 on ''[[Survivor: Africa]]'', the third season of the reality TV series ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]''. He also appeared on the [[Survivor: All-Stars|All-Stars]] edition of the show. After winning ''Survivor'' he co-founded [[Grassroot Soccer]], which uses soccer to raise money and awareness to fight [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- .entry-content --&gt; |url=http://www.grassrootsoccer.org|title=Grassroot Soccer|publisher=Grassroot Soccer|accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2010, he was ranked 14th in the [[USL Second Division]] Top 15 of the Decade, which announced a list of the best and most influential players of the previous decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/395254.html|title=USL-2 Top 15 of the Decade|accessdate=2010-01-26|work=USLsoccer.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126084842/http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/395254.html|archivedate=2010-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Zohn and his longtime girlfriend and fellow ''Survivor'' winner [[Jenna Morasca]] participated in the [[The Amazing Race 19|19th season]] of ''[[The Amazing Race (U.S. TV series)|The Amazing Race]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/08/31/amazing-race-cast-survivor-ethan-jenna/|title='Survivor' winners Ethan and Jenna head up new 'Amazing Race' cast.

==Soccer==
Zohn was a soccer [[goalkeeper (soccer)|goalkeeper]] at [[Lexington High School (Massachusetts)]] and [[Vassar College]], and played professionally for the [[Hawaii Tsunami]] and [[Cape Cod Crusaders]] of the [[United Soccer Leagues]] and in [[Zimbabwe]] for [[Highlanders F.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ezohn.com/about/ |title=About |date=2013-09-04 |website=Ethan Zohn |language=en-US |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He donated some of his winnings from Survivor to starting [[Grassroot Soccer]], an organization whose goal is to "mobilize the global soccer community to combat the [[AIDS]] epidemic in [[Africa]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.grassrootsoccer.org/2008/08/21/survivor-winner-begins-soccer-trek-from-gillette-stadium-to-dc/ |title=Survivor winner begins soccer trek from Gillette Stadium to DC |date=2008-08-21 |access-date=2018-05-15 |language=en-US |website=Grassroot Soccer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after winning Survivor Africa, Ethan was hired by ESPN to serve as a sideline reporter for the US National Team's matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.revolutionsoccer.net/post/2017/03/02/revolution-and-csn-new-england-announce-local-broadcast-schedule-2017 |title=Revolution and CSN New England Announce Local Broadcast Schedule for 2017 |website=Revolution Soccer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Zohn began to co-host the Metro Soccer Report (later renamed MSG Soccer Report) on the [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]], a weekly show dedicated to [[New York Red Bulls]] (formerly MetroStars) of [[Major League Soccer]]. As of April 2006, Zohn hosts FC Fox on the [[Fox Soccer Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060411005798/en/ADDING-MULTIMEDIA-FC-Fox-Generation-Fox-Soccer |title=ADDING MULTIMEDIA ``FC Fox,'' The Next Generation of Fox Soccer Channel's Popular Weekly Youth Soccer Show, to Debut Friday, April 21 at 7:30 PM (ET) |work=Business Wire |access-date=2018-05-15 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his combined humanitarian efforts to spread [[HIV]] education throughout Africa via soccer teams for youth and young adults, Zohn received the Courage of Conscience Award from The Peace Abbey in [[Sherborn, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://globalhealth.usc.edu/events/lectureseries/2014lectureseries/ethanzohn/ |title=Ethan Zohn // Character: The Ultimate Survival Tool |date=2014-11-06 |work=USC Institute for Global Health |access-date=2018-05-15 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Survivor''==

===''Africa''===
As part of the Boran tribe, Zohn did not become an immediate target in the game; he was seen as a strong player who could potentially help to win many tribal immunities. When his tribe lost two back-to-back [[Immunity (reality television)|immunity]] challenges, he joined the majority to vote off Diane Ogden and Jessie Camacho in episodes one and two. Over the next few days, Ethan would form a long-term alliance with Lex Van den Berghe and Tom Buchanan from his Boran tribe.

But a twist in episode five saw both of Zohn's alliance members switch from Boran to the Samburu tribe, leaving Ethan alone with fellow Boran members Kim Johnson, Kelly Goldsmith, and Clarence Black. Two of the new Boran members from the Samburu tribe, Teresa Cooper and Frank Garrison, had an old misunderstanding with another former Samburu member, Silas Gaither. So, by consensus, Zohn's tribe agreed to throw the immunity challenge in order to vote out the unpopular Gaither. Both of Zohn's alliance members Buchanan and Van den Berghe remained safe on the Samburu tribe, carrying all three into the merge.

Zohn's alliance soon began to control the game, with other members Johnson and Goldsmith. They immediately targeted Black due to his physical strength and he was voted out. But Van den Berghe had received another vote at tribal council, a vote he believed had come from Goldsmith, but which actually came from Cooper. This led Van den Berghe on a witch-hunt against Goldsmith which almost led to the demise of Zohn's alliance, when Goldsmith possessed the power with the other four ex-Samburu members, Cooper, Garrison, Kim Powers and Brandon Quinton. But at the last minute, Quinton switched his vote, saving Van den Berghe, and voting out Goldsmith. But this move came back to haunt Quinton, when Zohn's alliance saw him as untrustworthy and voted him out at the next tribal council.

Zohn, Van den Berghe, Buchanan, and Johnson regained control of the game, outing previous Samburu members Garrison, Powers and Cooper in the next three tribal councils, carrying them into the final four. At the next immunity challenge, Johnson, the next target to be voted out, won immunity, leading to the alliance having to resort to voting one of their own out, despite the fact that the challenge contained [[Survivor: Africa#Controversy|some controversy]]. At any rate, Zohn joined Van den Berghe and Johnson in voting out Buchanan, carrying them into the Final Three.

At the final three immunity challenge, older tribe member Johnson outlasted the two young, fit men to win immunity in an endurance challenge. With Johnson holding the power to choose who she would sit next to in the Final Two, she chose Zohn, believing that she could not win against either man, while thinking that Zohn deserved the money more than Van den Berghe did.

In the end, Zohn beat out Johnson in a 5-2 vote to become the Sole Survivor, gaining the votes of Goldsmith, Garrison, Cooper, Buchanan, and Van den Berghe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://azjewishlife.com/ethan-zohn-surviving-and-winning/ |title=Ethan Zohn: surviving and winning |date=2016-10-26 |website=Arizona Jewish Life |language=en-US |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''All-Stars''===
Zohn was invited to participate in ''[[Survivor: All-Stars]]'', which he gladly accepted. Originally part of the Saboga tribe, Zohn was immediately targeted as a previous winner, along with ''[[Survivor: The Australian Outback]]'' winner [[Tina Wesson]]. When Saboga lost immunity, the rest of the tribe decided to vote out Wesson first, needing Zohn's strength to win future challenges. When Saboga lost immunity once again, Zohn was spared once more over physical liability [[Rudy Boesch]], who had hurt his ankle previously.

In Episode 5, Zohn and the rest of the Saboga tribe were disbanded after losing a challenge. Zohn and [[Jerri Manthey]] joined the Mogo Mogo tribe, while [[Jenna Lewis]] and [[Rupert Boneham]] joined Chapera. Later in that episode, Zohn joined the rest of his new tribe to vote out ''[[Survivor: Borneo]]'' winner [[Richard Hatch (reality TV)|Richard Hatch]].

In Episode 7, Zohn was on the outs when the alliance of Manthey, Lex Van den Berghe, and Shii Ann Huang left him out in their decision to vote out [[Colby Donaldson]]. Zohn was shocked at the decision, feeling betrayed by old ''[[Survivor: Africa]]'' alliance member Van den Berghe.

In Episode 8, Mogo Mogo lost immunity once again, and Zohn, the last former winner, was voted out in 11th place overall, by a vote of 4-1. He was the most successful of the four previous winners who competed on All-Stars, lasting longer than Wesson, Hatch, and [[Jenna Morasca]], who quit the game on Day Nine to be with her ailing mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/ethan-zohn-survivor-40659/ |title=Survivor's Ethan Ejected |date=2004-03-19 |work=TVGuide.com |access-date=2018-05-15 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media appearances==
Zohn was a contestant on a February 28, 2005, episode of ''[[Fear Factor]]'', in which he competed against other reality TV competition winners, including his then-girlfriend [[Jenna Morasca]], who was the winner of ''[[Survivor: The Amazon]]''. He finished second, losing to former ''[[The Bachelorette|Bachelorette]]'' winner [[Ryan Sutter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/ethan-zohn |title=Ethan Zohn |website=www.huffingtonpost.com |language=en |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he appeared on ''[[Kill Reality]]'', which followed various reality television personalities as they filmed a horror movie called ''[[The Scorned]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=ethan+zohn+kill+reality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4SLGUhfJM2&amp;sig=IqA-R9B5vU8v_4tcmGogseZZ9eY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjii9f6tojbAhUCCKwKHVxWCNA4ChDoAQg9MAQ |title=Reichen's Return |date=2005-08-16 |publisher=The Advocate |language=en |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Zohn hosted ''Earth Tripping'', a six-episode TV series, in which he demonstrated how to be "an earth-friendly traveler", and shows viewers "how to employ new, natural and environmentally conscious methods when they travel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natgeotv.com.au/tv/earth-tripping/ |title=Earth Tripping &amp;#124; Nat Geo Adventure |publisher=Natgeotv.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the series Zohn visited [[New York City]], [[Mexico City]], [[Singapore]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Santiago, Chile]], and [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natgeotv.com.au/tv/earth-tripping/episodes.aspx?series=1 |title=Earth Tripping: Episode Guide - Series 1 &amp;#124; Nat Geo Adventure |publisher=Natgeotv.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zohn appeared in the 11th episode of the [[Discovery Channel]] show ''[[PitchMen#Episode 11|PitchMen]]'', in which he presented the EZ Crunch Bowl, a [[cereal]] bowl he designed to in which the cereal is kept in the shallow end and the milk in the deeper end in order to keep the cereal "crunchy" and not soggy. The bowl was picked by the show's co-stars, [[Billy Mays]] and [[Anthony Sullivan (pitchman)|Anthony Sullivan]], for manufacturing and marketing by [[Telebrands]]. The EZ Crunch Bowl was sent to Telebrands product engineers for improvement before being made available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ezcrunchbowl.com/|title= EZ Crunch Bowl product web site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zohn has co-hosted ''Outside Today'' on the cable TV network ''[[Outside Television]]''.&lt;ref name=OutsideTV&gt;[http://www.outsidetelevision.com/hosts/ethan-zohn Ethan Zohn], Outside Television, accessed June 30, 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918175954/http://www.outsidetelevision.com/hosts/ethan-zohn |date=September 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frank-desprez.jpg|thumb|right|Frank Desprez in 1913]]
'''Frank Desprez''' (9 February 1853 &amp;ndash; 25 November 1916) was an English playwright, essayist, and poet. He wrote more than twenty pieces for the theatre, as well as numerous shorter works, including his famous poem, ''Lasca''.

==Life and career==
Desprez was born in [[Bristol]], England, the eldest of the eleven children of Charles Desprez, a jeweller and silversmith. The family was of French descent. He was educated at Cosham School, [[Wiltshire]] and spent three years in his teens in the U.S. State of Texas. In 1883, Desprez married Jessie Louisa Potter Macqueen. They had a son and two daughters.

===Librettist and assistant to Richard D'Oyly Carte===
Desprez returned to Britain in 1875. His first piece written for the theatre shortly thereafter was an adaptation of ''[[La fille de Madame Angot]]''.  When this piece went on the road in 1876, he also wrote a companion piece for it called ''Happy Hampstead'', which was set to music by the theatrical agent and composer [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]].  Desprez became a close friend of Carte's and worked with him for many years as Carte's secretary.

At the same time Desprez wrote the texts for ten short works for D'Oyly Carte, most of which accompanied the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas on the bills at the [[Opera Comique]] and later the [[Savoy Theatre]]. These pieces had long runs in tandem with, and sometimes beyond, the runs of the principal pieces, and they were usually played on tour throughout Britain as companion pieces, benefit pieces and short-programme items. Working with composers such as [[Alfred Cellier]] and [[Edward Solomon]], Desprez became perhaps the most popular librettist of one-act operas in Britain.

[[File:Bee-bee l.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[The Nautch Girl]]'', 1891]]
Desprez's most frequently played work was his 1879 two-act [[musical theatre|musical play]], ''[[Tita in Thibet]]'', which was later played in the British provinces by the Majilton company more than a thousand times.  It was written as a vehicle for the music hall star [[Kate Santley]].  W. H. Seymour, who would become the stage manager of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] for 20 years, also played in the piece.  The story concerns an unusual marriage custom purportedly to be found "in out of the way parts of the world" such as Tibet.  The customs of the country permit every wife to have four husbands.  The reviewer from ''The Era'' did not find the piece "refined" enough for his taste.

Desprez's best work as a lyricist was ''[[The Nautch Girl]], or, The Rajah of Chutneypore'', which played at the Savoy Theatre in 1891-92.

===Poet, essayist, journalist, and editor===
Desprez' best-known work, however, is a poem, ''Lasca'', about a Mexican girl and her cowboy sweetheart caught in a cattle stampede "in Texas down by the Rio Grande." The ballad-like poem, first published in a London magazine in 1882, has often been reprinted, usually with deletions and changes, and recited in many parts of the English-speaking world. Between 1873 and 1882 at least four other of Desprez's poems had been published, two of which are about Texas.

In 1884, Desprez began writing for ''The Era'', London's foremost theatre paper, and he became its editor in 1893, a position he held until illness forced him to retire in 1913. Desprez also wrote dozens of essays on travel, art, music, and famous personalities that were published in English periodicals, most of them between 1905 and 1914.

Desprez died in London at the age of 63.

'''Georgii Dmitrievich Karpechenko''' (1899 in [[Velsk]], [[Vologda Governorate]] – July 28, 1941) was a [[Russia]]n and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] biologist. His name has sometimes been transliterated as Karpetschenko.&lt;ref&gt;Karpetschenko, G.D. (1929). Konstantwerden von Art- und Gattungsbastarden durch Verdoppelung der Chromosomenkomplexe. ''Der Züchter''. 5: 133–140. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/j2760253t31l8q29/ German abstract available]&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''Guy Pearse''' is an Australian author and former Research Fellow at the [http://gci.uq.edu.au Global Change Institute] at the [[University of Queensland]]. His first book titled ''[[High and Dry (book)|High &amp; Dry: John Howard, climate change and the selling of Australia's future]]'' was published in 2007. In 2009, Pearse published a critique of the Rudd government's response to climate change in [[Quarterly Essay]] 33: Quarry Vision: Coal, Climate Change and the End of the Resources Boom. In 2012, he published [http://www.guypearse.com/?p=1 Greenwash: Big Brands and Carbon Scams] – an analysis of whether the climate-friendly revolution being advertised by large multinationals is real.

Pearse worked for various Liberal politicians, as a lobbyist for numerous industries, and as a consultant to the [[Australian Greenhouse Office]]. He was speechwriter for Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]]'s first environment minister, [[Robert Hill (Australian politician)|Robert Hill]]. While studying at the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] in the mid 1990s, Pearse worked on the advance staff of then US Vice President [[Al Gore]].

Pearse's doctoral research at the [[Australian National University]]&lt;ref name="greenhousemafia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2006/s1568867.htm| title=Transcript of Janine Cohen's report "The Greenhouse Mafia"| publisher=[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]| date=13 February 2006| accessdate=21 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; focussed on the influence of the carbon lobby on the [[Howard government]]. This thesis became the basis for the "[[Greenhouse Mafia]]" episode of ABC's ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' in February 2006.

'''Hemşin''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Համշէն ''Hamshen'' or Համամաշէն ''Hamamashen'', literally "Hamam's Hamlet"; [[Laz language|Laz]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]]: ზუგა ''Zuga''), is a town and district of [[Rize Province]] in the [[Black Sea Region, Turkey|Black Sea]] region of [[Turkey]], 57&amp;nbsp;km from the city of [[Rize]].

Hemşin is a district of green hills 19&amp;nbsp;km inland from the [[Black Sea]]. The area is the ethnic homeland of the [[Hemshin peoples]] of Turkey.

==History==
{{Main|Rize Province}}
As part of the Rize province, Hemshin had been a refuge for some [[Cimmerians]]{{fact|date=February 2017}} and was a site of early Greek settlements and once part of the [[Roman Empire]] and the succeeding [[Byzantine Empire]].

In the [[8th century]], Prince [[Amatuni|Hamam]], his father Prince [[Shapuh Amatuni]], and their people migrated north to the [[Black Sea region]] in order to escape [[Arab conquest of Armenia|Arab invasions]] of [[Vaspurakan]]. They settled in the ruined city of Tambur and its surrounding villages. Prince Hamam rebuilt the city and named it Hamamshen ("Hamam's hamlet" in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]), this becoming the nucleus of the modern district.

This [[Principality of Hamamshen]] existed until the 14th century, when it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Demographics==
{{main|Hemshin peoples}}
The [[Hemshin peoples]] ({{lang-hy|Համշէնցիներ}}, {{lang|hy-latn|Hamshentsiner}}; {{lang-tr|Hemşinliler}}) are a diverse group of peoples who in the past or present have been affiliated with the region.&lt;ref name="Bert Vaux pp.1-2"&gt;Bert Vaux.

'''Isufu''' "'''Ike'''" '''Quartey''' (born 27 November 1969) is a [[Ghana]]ian former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1988 to 2006. He held the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[welterweight]] title from 1994 to 1998, and challenged once for [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[junior-middleweight]] title in 2000.

==Early years and amateur career==
Quartey is a member of [[Accra]]'s [[Ga people|Ga]] tribe. He is the youngest of 27 children. His father reportedly had five wives. His older brother [[Isaac Quartey]] won a silver medal in the [[Boxing at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympics]].

Quartey had an amateur record of 50-4, and represented [[Ghana]] as a [[Light Welterweight]] at [[Boxing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Seoul Olympic Games]].

==Professional career==
Quartey turned professional in 1988, a day short of his nineteenth birthday. He started his boxing career under the guidance of Yoofi Boham, without doubt the most successful manager in Ghana, and also father-in-law of former World boxing champion [[Azumah Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3004326.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Bukom: heartbeat of African boxing |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2003-06-25 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boham got Quartey recognized as a boxer on the international scene. Boham managed Quartey alongside Alfred "The Cobra" Kotey and gave them the names Bazooka and Cobra. Quartey and Kotey were so close that many thought they were brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/ike2210.html |title=Alfred Kotey Interview |website=Eastsideboxing.com |date=1994-07-30 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quartey began his professional career with a 2nd-round knockout of Mama Mohamed. Most of Quartey's early fights were staged in Ghana, before he relocated to France.

===WBA welterweight champion===
In Quartey's 26th fight he was given a shot at the WBA welterweight title, held by the then undefeated [[Crisanto España]] of [[Venezuela]]. Quartey knocked out Espana in the 11th round. At the time of the stoppage one judge had Quartey ahead, one had him behind and a third judge had the fight even.

He defended his title successfully seven times. Among his foes were Alberto Cortes, [[Vince Phillips]], and Oba Carr. In October 1997 he fought [[José Luis López (boxer)|José Luis López]] to a draw. The decision was originally read as a win for Quartey but reversed when a flaw was found in the scoring. Although Quartey was down twice, most observers felt that he deserved the victory and his reputation suffered little damage.

Personal, business and health issues kept Quartey out of the ring until February 1999. His inactivity led him to be stripped of his WBA title.

===Quartey vs. De La Hoya===
Quartey returned from a 14-month absence to challenge ''Lineal''/[[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[List of WBC world champions#Welterweight|welterweight champion]] [[Oscar De La Hoya]] at the Thomas &amp; Mack center in Las Vegas, Nevada on 13 February 1999. Quartey was floored in 6th and 12th rounds, with De La Hoya also down in the 6th round. De La Hoya came away with a close, albeit controversial split decision.

===Quartey vs. Vargas===
Following the defeat to De La Hoya, Quartey would take another 14-month hiatus from the ring. He returned in April 2000 to challenge [[Fernando Vargas]] for the [[IBF]] [[List of IBF world champions#Junior middleweight|light-middleweight championship]]. Quartey was defeated by a unanimous decision with scores of 116-111 twice and 114-113.

Following this fight, Quartey would not fight for another five years.

===Return to the ring===
Quartey returned to the ring in January 2005. He won the first three bouts of his comeback with victories over Clint McNeil, [[Verno Phillips]] and [[Carlos Bojorquez]]. On 5 August 2006, he lost a close unanimous decision to former welterweight champion [[Vernon Forrest]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], [[New York City|New York]] by scores of 93-96, 94-95, &amp; 94-95. [[CompuBox]] stats showed Quartey outlanding Forrest (201 out of 481, 42% for Quartey; 184 of 818, 22% for Forrest), and Forrest was docked 1 point for a [[Groin attack|low blow]] in the 9th round. The decision was deemed controversial by most ringsider reporters, [[HBO]]'s ringside commentators (including "unofficial scorer" [[Harold Lederman]]), and much of the crowd in attendance, who responded with a semi-raucous chorus of boos and repeated chants of "Bullshit!" after the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jswm4zhi3Q |title=Vernon Forrest vs Ike Quartey - 4/4 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=1995-03-04 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2541145 |title=Forrest wins unanimous - and controversial - decision |website=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2006-08-05 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140407072427/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/weblog/news.php?p=7835&amp;more=1 ]&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2006, Quartey's fought former undisputed light-middleweight champion [[Ronald "Winky" Wright]] at the St. Pete Times Forum, [[Tampa]], [[Florida]]. Quartey was down once in the fight and went on to lose a unanimous points decision.

==Boxing style==
Quartey's best weapon was his jab, which was considered to be one of the best in boxing while he was in his prime. He primarily relied on a "peek-a-boo" or "clam-shell" defense, which consisted of him allowing punches to land on his arms, elbows and gloves which he kept held tightly to his cheeks and ribcage.

'''Muhammad 'Izzat Darwaza''' ({{lang-ar|محمد عزت دروزة}}; 1888–1984&lt;ref name="birthyear"/&gt;) was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] politician, historian, and educator from [[Nablus]]. Early in his career, he worked as an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] bureaucrat in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Lebanon]]. Darwaza had long been a sympathizer of [[Arab nationalism]] and became an activist of that cause following the [[Arab Revolt]] against the Ottoman Empire in 1916, joining the nationalist [[al-Fatat]] society. As such, he campaigned for the union of [[Greater Syria]] (modern-day [[Levant]]) and vehemently opposed [[Zionism]] and foreign mandates in Arab lands. From 1922 to 1927, he served as an educator and as the principal at the [[an-Najah National University|an-Najah National School]] where he implemented a pro-Arab nationalist educational system, promoting the ideas of Arab independence and unity. Darwaza's particular brand of Arab nationalism was influenced by [[Islam]] and his beliefs in Arab unity and the oneness of [[Arabic culture]].

Later, Darwaza co-founded the nationalist [[Independence Party (Palestine)|Istiqlal]] party in Palestine and was a principal organizer of anti-[[United Kingdom|British]] demonstrations. In 1937, he was exiled to [[Damascus]] as a result of his activities and from there he helped support the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab revolt]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine]]. He was incarcerated in Damascus by [[French Mandate of Syria|French authorities]] for his involvement in the revolt, and while in prison he began to study the [[Qur'an]] and its interpretations. In 1945, after he was released, Darwaza eventually compiled his own [[Tafsir|interpretation]] entitled ''al-Tafsir al-Hadith''.

In 1946, he joined the [[Arab Higher Committee]] led by [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]], but resigned the next year after being disenfranchised by al-Husayni's methods. He left for Syria afterward and briefly aided in the unity talks between Syria and [[Egypt]] in the mid-1950s. By the time of his death in 1984, Darwaza had written over thirty books and published numerous articles on the [[Palestinian nationalism|Palestinian question]], Arab history, and Islam.&lt;ref name="Muslih"/&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and background===
Darwaza was born to a middle-class [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] mercantile family in [[Nablus]].&lt;ref name="Muslih"/&gt; The Darwaza family had long been involved in textiles and had extensive trade relationships with merchants in [[Beirut]] and [[Damascus]]. In his memoirs, Izzat writes "The import of [textile] goods from the outside was, for the most part, through Beirut and Damascus."&lt;ref name="Doumani61"&gt;Doumani, 1995, pp. 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Izzat's father, 'Abd al-Hadi Darwaza and his paternal grandfather Darwish Darwaza, owned a store in the [[Khan al-Tujjar (Nablus)|Khan al-Tujjar]] of Nablus.&lt;ref name="Muslih"/&gt;  Izzat recalled, "From what I remember from my father and through my grandfather, the title merchant or merchants in Nablus mostly referred to owners of commercial textile and cloth shops. In Nablus, these shops were confined, or mostly confined, to a caravansary called Khan al-Tujjar, in the middle of Nablus."&lt;ref name="Doumani59"&gt;Doumani, 1995, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Izzat received elementary and preparatory education in Ottoman government-run schools in the city.&lt;ref name="Muslih"/&gt; In addition to [[Arabic language|Arabic]], he learned [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[English language|English]], as well as a basic knowledge of [[French language|French]] which he strengthened in by the end of his formal education.&lt;ref name="Matthews267"&gt;Matthews, 2006, p.267.&lt;/ref&gt; Darwaza left school without going to [[Istanbul]] or Beirut to finish his education as was the custom of his generation.&lt;ref name="Choueiri25"/&gt; Instead, he educated himself, and according to [[Rashid Khalidi]], became "a self-taught intellectual."&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi, 1993, p.178.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loyalty to dissidence toward the Ottoman Empire===
Originally, Darwaza supported the [[Ottoman Empire]] based on his feelings of identification with [[Islam]] and of belonging to the larger Ottoman Muslim ''[[ummah]]'' ("nation"). In 1906, he served in the local Ottoman administration as a clerk in the Department of Telegraphic and Postal Services (DTPS) in Nablus.&lt;ref name="PASSIA"/&gt; His first assignment in that department was for the District of Beisan and northern Palestine (the [[Galilee]] and northern [[Samaria]]).&lt;ref name="Muslih"/&gt; He was also an [[Pan-Arabism|Arabist]] and was enthusiastic about the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908, expecting that the new Ottoman government would institute reforms and grant the Arabs autonomy within the framework of the empire.&lt;ref name="HandS237"/&gt;

His loyalty to the Ottomans eroded, however, due to the impact of the new governments's [[Turkification]] policies which he viewed as repressive against his ideals. Because of his dissatisfaction with the Young Turks, Darwaza was driven to support Arab independence from the empire.&lt;ref name="HandS237"&gt;Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, he joined the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP), but withdrew soon after because of its [[Turkish nationalism|Turkish nationalist]] political agenda.&lt;ref name="Muslih"/&gt; He played an active role in establishing a branch for the Party of Harmony and Freedom in Nablus in 1911. The party was founded in Istanbul and joined by Arab members to counter the policies of the CUP. In 1913, he joined a [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] group based in Nablus that sought to prevent the sale of Arab-owned land to [[Jew]]s by submitting petitions to the Ottoman sultan, or by buying land for sale to preempt its purchase by Jews. In June 1913, he helped to prepare and became secretary of the First Palestinian Congress (also known as the [[Arab Congress of 1913]]) in [[Paris]]. In congress, he was also the delegate for the [[Jamma'in]] subdistrict of the [[District of Nablus]]. Meanwhile, Darwaza was still working in the DTPS.&lt;ref name="Muslih"/&gt;

In 1914, he established the Arab Scientific Society whose purpose was to spread [[Arab culture|Arabic culture]] in the region through the establishment of Arabic schools. The society did not succeed, however, due to the outbreak of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Muslih"/&gt; Within the DTPS, Darwaza was appointed commissioner and deputy for the Nablus Post Office. He was promoted again—this time as director of postal stamp sales in Beirut.&lt;ref name="Muslih"/&gt;

===Promoting unity with Syria===

During World War I, Darwaza served as Postal Directorate-General of Beirut and retained this post until 1918.&lt;ref name="Muslih"&gt;Muslih, 1989, pp. 146-148.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, while serving with the Ottoman army in the [[Sinai Peninsula]],&lt;ref name="Matthews267"/&gt; he joined the underground [[al-Fatat]] organization through Ahmad Qadri, a high-ranking member from Damascus. The aim of al-Fatat was to liberate and unite the Arab lands under Ottoman rule.&lt;ref name="MSN"&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580047/darwaza_izzat_muhammad.html Izzat Muhammad Darwaza] MSN Encarta. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kwrfLOQP Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the [[Arab Revolt]] of 1916, Darwaza left the Ottoman civil service to serve in [[Faisal I|King Faisal]]'s provisional government in Damascus. Ideologically, Darwaza became an [[Arab nationalist]] endorsing the concept of a [[Greater Syria|Greater Syrian Arab state]].&lt;ref name="HandS237"/&gt;

Following the [[Armistice with Germany|World War I Armistice]], Darwaza held several political posts including Secretary-General of al-Fatat from May 1919 to March 1920, Secretary of the [[Muslim-Christian Associations|Muslim-Christian Association]]'s Nablus branch, and Secretary of the First [[Palestine Arab Congress]] in [[Jerusalem]] in 1919.&lt;ref name="Muslih"/&gt; During the spring and summer of 1919, a vigorous political campaign was waged by the Arab politicians in Palestine who were divided into "Younger Politicians" and "Older Politicians". The campaign was centered on the political future of Palestine, and Darwaza, a Younger Politician, played a central role. The Younger Politicians consisted of Arab nationalists who sought to unite Palestine with King Faisal's Syria while the Older Politicians consisted of [[Palestinian nationalism|Palestinian nationalists]] who preferred that Palestine be an independent entity.&lt;ref name="Muslih193"/&gt;

Darwaza and Hafiz Kanaan—another leading al-Fatat member from Nablus—lobbied Arab groups in Jerusalem to advocate Syro-Palestinian unity before the arrival of the [[King-Crane Commission]] on 10 June 1919. They first met with [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] and [[Kamil al-Husayni]] of al-Nadi al-Arabi party and they immediately expressed their support. They also suggested that Darwaza meet [[Raghib al-Nashashibi]], [[Hussam ad-Din Jarallah]], and [[Aref al-Dajani]], supporters of independence. Darwaza convinced Nashashibi to gather some of the Older Politicians of Jerusalem to a meeting at his house. When it was made clear that [[Musa al-Husayni]], a leader of the Older Politicians, was now in favor of unity, all of the other Older Politicians followed suit.&lt;ref name="Muslih193"&gt;Muslih, 1989, pp. 193-194.&lt;/ref&gt; When the commission arrived in [[Jaffa]], it concluded on 27 June that it was in favor of Syro-Palestinian unity under a [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]].&lt;ref&gt;Muslih, 1989, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first week of July 1919, the [[Syrian National Congress|General Syrian Congress]] (GSC) held its first meeting in Damascus and Darwaza was its secretary. The GSC called for the immediate independence of Syria as a sovereign state under a constitutional monarchy and underlined its opposition to the establishment of Zionism in southern Syria (Palestine).&lt;ref&gt;Kayyali, 1978, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Haj Amin al-Husseini and [[Aref al-Aref]], Darwaza founded and became an officer of the Palestinian Society in Damascus. The organization urged all societies and clubs in Palestine to cooperate and condemn the [[San Remo Conference]]'s decision to grant [[Great Britain]] a mandate over Palestine and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]].&lt;ref&gt;Kayyali, 1978, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hope of Darwaza and the Younger Politicians for unity with Syria were curtailed when it became known that King Faisal was aligning himself with the leaders of the Zionist movement because "they [the Zionists] were helping us [the Arabs] in the [Paris Peace] [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|conference]]." Afterward, Darwaza believed King Faisal did not devote to the Palestine issue its deserved attention. Faisal was deposed by the French in July 1920. An event that further deteriorated Darwaza's ambitions of Arab unity was the confirmation of the British Mandate over Palestine at the San Remo Conference on 24 April 1920.&lt;ref name="Muslih203"&gt;Muslih, 1989, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; His experience in Damascus revealed to him that the universalism of Arab nationalism was not as concrete as its advocates had thought, and the military might of the colonial powers—[[France]] and Great Britain—were an overwhelming force to contend with.&lt;ref name="HandS237"/&gt;

===Educator in Nablus===
Darwaza continued his political activity, representing Nablus in the Fourth Palestinian Congress in May 1921 and the Seventh Palestinian Congress in June 1928. From 1922 to 1927, he served as the principal of the an-Najah National School (later to become [[an-Najah National University]]) where he initiated and nurtured an Arab nationalist political educational process. Darwaza wrote textbooks and was an educator himself. One of his students who later became a nationalist politician, Akram Zu'aiter, wrote that Darwaza "used to give us a weekly lesson on the principles of Nationalism and [modern] society, in a way which sharpened our thought and broadened our horizons."&lt;ref name="Kedourie31"/&gt; Zuaiter also recalls that Darwaza wrote up nationalist and historical plays that his students would perform in.&lt;ref name="Kedourie31"&gt;Kedourie, Gammer, Kostiner, and Shemesh, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pgZ9cvt6JyQC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=Izzat+Darwaza&amp;lr=&amp;ei=bec6SpStIYe-yQSSz8m6BQ p. 31].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, [[Rashid al-Haj Ibrahim]], the leader of the Young Men's Muslim Association of [[Haifa]], a prominent merchant, and future associate of Darwaza, invited him to his home to speak to a large group of students and notables about nationalist (''qawmiyya'') and patriotic (''wataniyya'') education. This was recognition that Darwaza's contribution to the spread of Arab nationalist sentiments gained influence not only in an-Najah School, but throughout Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 2006, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fight against the British Mandate===
[[File:Palestinian leaders imprisoned in Sarafand.jpg|thumb|right|Darwaza (right) and [[Awni Abd al-Hadi]] (left) during their internment in the British military camp of [[Sarafand al-Amar]], 1936]]
Darwaza became a member of the Arab Executive Committee and in 1930 was appointed by rival nationalist Haj Amin al-Husseini (now the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]) as the General Administrator of the [[Waqf]] (Islamic religious trust) under the [[Supreme Muslim Council]].&lt;ref name="PASSIA"&gt;[http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/personalities/alpha_d.htm Palestinian personalities D] [[Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs]]. (PASSIA).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Migdal 2003, p. 114"&gt;Kimmerling and Migdal, 2003, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, he convinced his city's MCA to change its name to the Patriotic Arab Association. Unlike other Arab politicians at the time, Darwaza supported a combination of pan-Arabism, [[Islamism]], and dedication to the Palestinian nationalist ideal.&lt;ref name="KandM97"/&gt;

He began to edit in the ''al-Ja'miyya al-Arabiyya'' newspaper in the early 1930s and in December 1931-January 1932, he wrote articles encouraging Arabs to fight British policies in the [[Middle East]], to unite in the face of growing dangers, and to renew their drive towards freedom and independence.&lt;ref&gt;Kayyali, 1978, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1932, he along with [[Awni Abd al-Hadi]] and others founded the [[Independence Party (Palestine)|Istiqlal]] (Independence) party in Palestine, an offshoot of al-Fatat. Originally, the Istiqlal operated in Syria, then Transjordan, but reassembled in Palestine after facing disappointing circumstances in both those territories. The party coaxed Palestinians towards defying British rule by staging demonstrations and political and social boycotts. Darwaza refused to allow the Istiqlal to participate in meetings between local Palestinian political parties and the British high-commissioner.&lt;ref name="KandM97"&gt;Kimmerling and Migdal, 2003, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Darwaza wrote an article on 21 June 1933, vehemently attacking Palestinian "vested interests". He argued that the wealthy Arab notables of Palestine were subservient to the British and the Zionists and would willingly leave Palestine for other countries, while the poor and middle-class Arabs had to remain to fight and die in their battle against British oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Kayyali, 1978, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Darwaza helped instigate and organize the 1933 demonstrations in Jaffa which protested [[United Kingdom|British]] policy in Palestine and continued [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]].&lt;ref name="MSN"/&gt;

Darwaza was one of the principal organizers of the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]] which first erupted in his hometown of Nablus with the launch of the [[Palestinian general strike]].&lt;ref name="MSN"/&gt; Along with Abd al-Hadi, Darwaza was arrested by the British authorities in June and imprisoned in the military camp at [[Sarafand al-Amar]].&lt;ref&gt;Elpeleg, 1993, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mufti sent a delegation consisting of Darwaza, [[Mu'in al-Madi]], and Abd al-Hadi to [[Baghdad]], then to [[Riyadh]] to discuss the situation and upon their return on 6 January 1937, they revealed that the advice given to them was to cease hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;Nafi, 1998, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; During the revolt, in 1937, Darwaza was exiled from Palestine by British authorities to Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Levenberg, 1993, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in that year, Darwaza held several meetings with [[Nuri al-Sa'id]] of [[Iraq]] to explore various solutions to help the Arabs avoid appearing intransigent.&lt;ref&gt;Nafi, 1998, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite attempts to calm the situation, in Damascus, Darwaza established and headed the [[Central Committee of Jihad|Central Committee for National Jihad in Palestine]] which echoed [[Izz al-Din al-Qassam]]'s call for a holy war against the British and Zionism. Darwaza had many encounters with al-Qassam, describing him as "a man lacking in arrogance or self-love. He was open and available to all of the people and the people loved him. And he lived the life of a ''[[Mujahideen|mujahid]]''."&lt;ref name="IQ"&gt;[http://www.salaam.co.uk/knowledge/qassam.php The Life and Thought of 'Izz-Id-Din Al-Qassam]. The Islamic Quarterly, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Darwaza worked closely with the Mufti, who was now under house arrest in Beirut, to garner support and supplies for the revolt and supervise the Arab rebels in Palestine.&lt;ref name="Migdal 2003, p. 114"/&gt;

In late 1939, he was accused by French military authorities of helping Palestinian rebels in the revolt, tried by a military court, and sentenced to five years imprisonment in the [[Citadel of Damascus]].&lt;ref name="Abu-Ghazaleh"/&gt; While his exile by the British abruptly curtailed his political life, his imprisonment marked the beginning of a new life wherein the [[Quran]] becomes a major concern for the next several years.&lt;ref name="HandS225"&gt;Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in November 1944.&lt;ref name="Abu-Ghazaleh"&gt;Abu-Ghazaleh, 1973, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; After his release, Darwaza was unable to return to Nablus because British authorities had issued an order preventing him from entering Palestine. As a result, he left for [[Turkey]], mostly staying in [[Bursa]] until the end of 1945.&lt;ref name="HandS226"/&gt;

The Mufti re-established the [[Arab Higher Committee]] (AHC) in late 1946 and Darwaza joined the ten-member council upon a request from the Mufti.&lt;ref&gt;Khalaf, 1991, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Darwaza, along with [[Emil Ghuri]] and Mu'in al-Madi, served as the AHC's delegates to the September 1947 convention of the [[Arab League]]'s Political Committee in Lebanon. With support from the Transjordanian representative, [[Salih Jaber]], the [[Prime Minister of Iraq]], openly criticized the delegates and questioned the AHC's right to even send delegates to the convention.&lt;ref&gt;Khalaf, 1991, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Darwaza resigned from the AHC due to the Mufti's unbending attitude towards wider representation.&lt;ref&gt;Khalaf, 1991, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
After resigning from the AHC, Darwaza spent the rest of his life in the modern state of [[Syria]] where he left politics to concentrate on literature. Although he did much of his writing in the 1930s and 1940s, he did not have any of his works published until the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Zebiri145"/&gt; As a pan-Arab intellectual, Darwaza aided in establishing the union between Syria and [[Egypt]] forming the short-lived [[United Arab Republic]]. After Egypt adopted its 1956 [[Constitution of Egypt|constitution]] declaring that it was an Arab country and its people a part of the Arab nation, Darwaza concluded that Egypt and Syria were in a position to unite.&lt;ref name="PandM29"&gt;Podeh and Ma'oz, 1999, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; When unity negotiations underwent, he suggested several forms of federation, such as the [[United States|American]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], and [[India]]n models, but did not recommend any specific model for an Arab state. Darwaza did, however, suggest that the institution of a federation between Egypt and Syria would be the first step towards the realization of a comprehensive union.&lt;ref&gt;Podeh and Ma'oz, 1999, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 Darwaza granted Palestinian historian Muhammad Y. Muslih an eight-day interview and allowed him to photo-copy his memoirs in entirety. Muslih noted that Darwaza was failing in health at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Muslih, 1988, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Damascus in 1984 at the age of 96.&lt;ref name="Zebiri145"&gt;Zebiri, 1993, pp. 145-146.&lt;/ref&gt; Darwaza had three daughters, Najah, Salma, and Rudaina and a son, Zuhair.

==Literary works==
[[File:Izzat Darwaza.jpg|thumb|right|Darwaza in traditional Arab robe]]
One of the first modern histories of the [[Arab world|Arab nation]] in contrast to a history of an individual Arab country was composed by Darwaza in the late 1920s under the title ''Lessons of Arab History: From Antiquity to Present Times''. In the book, Darwaza begins by describing the origins of the [[Semitic peoples]], the [[Muslim conquests|rise of Islam]], the end of Arab rule in the Middle East by [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups, and the foreign rule over the Arabs by Western powers. The book was intended to be used as a textbook in primary and secondary schools throughout the British Mandates of Palestine and later [[British Mandate of Iraq|Iraq]], hence its simplified and direct language. Nonetheless, it played a pioneering role in the development of pan-Arabism.&lt;ref name="Choueiri25"&gt;Choueiri, 2000, pp. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Darwaza published a widely read story, ''The Angel and the Land Broker'', reflecting popular Arab sentiments against the growing "Zionist threat" and attacking brokers who tempted Palestinian land owners to sell their land to Jews. The story describes methods used by Zionists to entice Arab landowners to sell their land and the main characters in the story are an illiterate farmer and a Jewish girl from [[Tel Aviv]] who encourages the former to spend himself deep into debt, forcing him to sell his land at a price far below its value.&lt;ref&gt;Sufian and LeVine, 2007, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in his lifetime after leaving politics, Darwaza published memoirs that discussed in detail the city of Nablus in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to Youssef Choueiri, "he gives a graphic and almost exhaustive description of his hometown... its mosques, residential quarters, orchards, industries, and inhabitants. Moreover, he dwells at length of the social composition of the town endeavoring to reveal the open conflict between 'feudal families' and the new generation of middle traders, functionaries, civil servants, and teachers."&lt;ref name="Choueiri25"/&gt;

===Quranic studies and interpretations===
While he was imprisoned in Damascus, Darwaza was provided with an opportunity to read and reflect upon the [[Quran]]. He states "I considered [this opportunity] an act of divine [favor] and started reading whatever books of [[exegesis]] and qur'anic studies were accessible to me." During his incarceration, he compiled three books dealing with the Quran and conceived the idea of writing a modern ''[[tafsir]]'' ("interpretation").&lt;ref name="HandS225"/&gt;

His time in Turkey exposed him to the libraries of [[Bursa]] and it was there where he wrote the rough draft of his ''tafsir'' entitled ''al-Tafsir al-Hadith''. Darwaza states in this exegesis he would "uncover the wisdom of revelation, the fundamental concepts of the Qur'an and the whole range of its subject matter and present it in a new style and new sequential order." ''Al-Tafsir al-Hadith'' was generally aimed at the Muslim youth who had been alienated by the traditional interpretations of the Quran.&lt;ref name="Zebiri145"/&gt; Darwaza placed much emphasis on the close relationship between the text of the Quran and the environment in which it was revealed. He rejected the ''[[hadith]]'' which states the Qur'an was originally preserved on a tablet in the [[Seven Heavens#Seven Heavens in Islam|seventh heaven]], sent down to lowest heaven and from there gradually to [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Zebiri145"/&gt;

After the completion of the rough draft, he wrote a volume of four chapters, ''Qur'an al-Majid'', which served as an introduction for the ''tafsir''.&lt;ref name="HandS226"&gt;Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Darwaza stresses a close connection between the Quran and the biography of the Muhammad (''sira'') and states that the Quran fully reflects various stages between the Quran and the career of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="HandS228"&gt;Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; He also emphasizes that both the [[angel]]s and the ''[[Genie|jinn]]'' are spoken in the Quran not for their own sake, but to reinforce Muhammad's missions and goals.&lt;ref&gt;Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

He contends that the presentation of the Quran and its ''[[sura]]s'' was dictated by Muhammad and that the task of [[Abu Bakr]] was to collect the Quran between its two covers and transcribe it into one copy, while [[Uthman]]'s task was to fix the transcription and unify it to prevent variant readings. He also expresses doubts that [[Ali]], as it is alleged, had made a chronologically arranged collection. Darwaza was very critical of other modern interpreters who used certain verses of the Quran to deduce and support scientific theories. He argues that those people have done harm to Islam by trivializing the sacred character of the Quran.&lt;ref name="HandS228"/&gt;

Darwaza was convinced that interpretations of the Quran were the only possible basis for any renewal and development of Islamic religious, political and social thought, and that the Quran was the only resource for Muslim reinterpretation of traditional norms in Islam and Islamic thinking.&lt;ref name="HandS228"/&gt; Since it was quite uncommon to follow a chronological order for a whole ''tafsir''—which Darwaza did—he had to justify his position by seeking a ''[[fatwa]]'' from the [[mufti]]s of [[Aleppo]] and Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Throughout his life, Darwaza was an Arab nationalist and supported the unity of Syria and Palestine. His particular brand of Arab nationalism was influenced by Islam, his belief in Arab unity, and the oneness of Arabic culture. According to his perspective, the ideology's main points were the Arabic language, the Arab homeland, a shared Arab history and common Arab interests. Although Darwaza believed that Arab nationalism pre-dated Islam, he also maintained that Islam expanded Arab territory and "stamped them with the eternal mark of Arab nationalism." According to Muhammad Y. Muslih, this meant that Islam had provided Arabs with "spiritual, cultural, and legal unity and within the framework of that unity the Arab individual formed his moral and social beliefs, irrespective of where he lived and through it the Arabs were able to preserve national identity and maintain their culture in the face of foreign invaders, including the Ottomans".&lt;ref name="Muslih"/&gt; Darwaza contends that Arab nationalism is not a new concept borrowed from the West and asserts the constituents of Arab nationalism are stronger than those which make up the modern forms of [[nationalism]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hawting and Shareef, 1993, pp. 245-246.&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas helped the spread the word of secular pan-Arabism against [[Islamism|religious nationalist]]s and those who believed in separate [[Syrian nationalism|Syrian]], [[Lebanese nationalism|Lebanese]], and [[Palestinian nationalism|Palestinian destinies]].&lt;ref name="Khalidi179"/&gt; In the mid-1950s, Darwaza asserted that the first stage of Arab union should be based on a merger between Egypt and Syria. In his opinion, a union between the northern Arabs (Syria) and the southern Arabs (Egypt) would facilitate the adherence of other Arab states.&lt;ref&gt;Podeh and Ma'oz, 1999, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that Egypt's capabilities and human resources compelled it to fill the role of an Arab "[[Prussia]]".&lt;ref name="PandM29"/&gt; Darwaza remarked on [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], Egyptian president and founder of the short-lived union, saying "Since the Arab revolt against the Turks, no Arab leader has been up to the level of events except for Jamal 'Abd al-Nasir. He emerged and vanished like a shooting star."&lt;ref name="Muslih203"/&gt;

Rashid Khalidi states about Darwaza, "Moved as he was by the civilization of Arabs, he evoked a distant Arab past. For obvious reasons Islam was central to that past. But in the case of Darwaza, Islam was important not as the binding substance of the nation, but as a culture and civilization. In other words, culture, language, and history not [[Ummah|religious solidarity]] were posited as the glue that was to hold the Arab nation together." According to Khalidi, Darwaza contributed to Arab nationalism in the practical and intellectual domains greatly.&lt;ref name="Khalidi179"&gt;Khalidi, 1993, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Wilson''' (September 14, 1742 – August 21, 1798) was one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] and a signatory of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution]]. Wilson was elected twice to the [[Continental Congress]], where he represented [[Pennsylvania]], and was a major force in drafting the [[United States Constitution]]. A leading legal theorist, he was one of the six original justices appointed by [[George Washington]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

Born near [[St Andrews]], [[Scotland]], Wilson immigrated to [[Philadelphia]] in 1766, becoming a teacher at the [[Academy and College of Philadelphia|College of Philadelphia]]. After studying under [[John Dickinson]], he set up a legal practice in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]. He wrote a well received pamphlet arguing that [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]]'s taxation of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] was illegitimate due to the colonies' lack of representation in Parliament. He was elected to the Continental Congress and served as president of the [[Illinois-Wabash Company]], a land [[speculation]] company.

Wilson was a delegate to the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Philadelphia Convention]], and served on the [[Committee of Detail]], which produced the first draft of the United States Constitution. Along with [[Roger Sherman]], he proposed the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], which counted [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of representation in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. After the convention, he campaigned for the ratification of the document, and his "speech in the statehouse yard" was reprinted in newspapers throughout the country. He also played a major role in drafting the 1790 [[Pennsylvania Constitution]].

In 1789, Wilson became one of the first Associate Justices of the Supreme Court. He also became a professor of law at the [[College of Philadelphia]] (which later became the [[University of Pennsylvania]]). Wilson suffered financial ruin from the [[Panic of 1796–97]] and was briefly imprisoned in a [[debtors' prison]] on two occasions. He suffered a [[stroke]] and died in August 1798, becoming the first U.S. Supreme Court justice to die.

==Early life and education==
Wilson was one of seven children born into a Presbyterian farming family on September 14, 1742, near [[St. Andrews]], Scotland, to William Wilson and Alison Landall. He studied at the Universities of [[University of St. Andrews|St. Andrews]], [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] and [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], but never obtained a degree.&lt;ref name="USH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/signers/wilson.htm |title=Signers of the Declaration of Independence |publisher=Independence Hall Association |work=ushistory.org |accessdate=February 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710163946/http://www.ushistory.org/Declaration/Signers/wilson.htm |archivedate=July 10, 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was a student, he studied [[Scottish Enlightenment]] thinkers, including [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_sglah/wilson/jameswilson.shtml |title=James Wilson |publisher=University of St. Andrews |accessdate=November 30, 2012}} (this source claims that Wilson graduated from St. Andrews, but that claim is contradicted by the previous source)&lt;/ref&gt; He also played golf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ross E. |last=Davies |year=2010 |title=The Ancient and Judicial Game: James Wilson, John Marshall Harlan, and the Beginnings of Golf at the Supreme Court |journal=Journal of Supreme Court History |volume=35 |issue= |pages=122–123 |ssrn=1573857 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Imbued with the ideas of the Scottish Enlightenment, he moved to [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, in [[British America]] in 1765, carrying letters of introduction that enabled him to begin tutoring and then teaching at [[The Academy and College of Philadelphia]] (now the [[University of Pennsylvania]]). He petitioned there for a degree and was awarded an honorary Master of Arts several months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1700s/wilson_jas.html |title=Penn Biographies: James Wilson (1742-1798) |last=Archives and Records Center |website=archives.upenn.edu/ |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |location=Philadelphia, PA |access-date=February 8, 2018 |ref={{sfnRef|"Penn Biographies: James Wilson (1742-1798)"}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, the university awarded him the [[honorary degree]] of [[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]]{{sfn|"Penn Biographies: James Wilson (1742-1798)"}}

While tutoring and teaching, Wilson began to [[reading law|read the law]] at the office of [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]]. He attained the bar in Philadelphia in 1767, and established a practice in [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], Pennsylvania. His office was very successful and he earned a small fortune in a few years. By then he had a small farm near [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]], Pennsylvania, was handling cases in eight local counties, became a founding trustee of [[Dickinson College]], and was lecturing at The Academy and College of Philadelphia. Wilson's religious beliefs evolved throughout his life, and have been the subject of some dispute, as there are writings from various points of his life from which it can be argued that he leaned towards [[Presbyterianism]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Thomism]], or [[Deism]], although it has been deemed likely that he eventually favored some form of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark D.

On November 5, 1771, he married Rachel Bird, daughter of William Bird and Bridget Hulings; they had six children together: Mary, William, Bird, James, Emily and Charles.  Rachel died in 1786, and in 1793 he married Hannah Gray, daughter of Ellis Gray and Sarah D'Olbear; the marriage produced a son named Henry, who died at age three.  After Wilson's death, Hannah married Thomas Bartlett, M.D.

==Career==

===American Revolution===
In 1774, Wilson published "Considerations on the Nature and Extent of the Legislative Authority of the British Parliament." In this [[pamphleteer|pamphlet]], Wilson argued that the Parliament had no authority to pass laws for the American colonies because the colonies had no representation in Parliament. It presented his views that all power derived from the people. Yet, he wrote that the people owed their allegiance to the English king: "A denial of the legislative authority of the British parliament over America is by no means inconsistent with that connexion, which ought to subsist between the mother country and her colonies." Scholars considered his work on par with the seminal works of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]] of the same year. However, it was actually penned in 1768, perhaps the first cogent argument to be formulated against British dominance. Some see Wilson as a leading revolutionary while others see him as another reluctant, elite revolutionary reacting to the stream of events determined by the radicals on the ground.

In 1775, he was commissioned Colonel of the 4th Cumberland County Battalion&lt;ref name=USH /&gt; and rose to the rank of Brigadier General of the Pennsylvania State Militia.&lt;ref name=lalexander&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=Lucien Hugh |title=James Wilson, Patriot, and the Wilson Doctrine |year=1906 |publisher=The North American Review |location=Philadelphia |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=jkYaAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Brigadier+General+Pennsylvania+State+Militia+james+wilson&amp;ots=SkTp6VAAMP&amp;sig=InVxv9bQTVSvUI-tXUwbtxWdTD4#v=onepage&amp;q=Brigadier%20General%20Pennsylvania%20State%20Militia%20james%20wilson&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the [[Continental Congress]] in 1776, Wilson was a firm advocate for independence. Believing it was his duty to follow the wishes of his constituents, Wilson refused to vote until he had [[caucus]]ed his district. Only after he received more feedback did he vote for independence. While serving in the Congress, Wilson was clearly among the leaders in the formation of French policy. "If the positions he held and the frequency with which he appeared on committees concerned with Indian affairs are an index, he was until his departure from Congress in 1777 the most active and influential single delegate in laying down the general outline that governed the relations of Congress with the border tribes."&lt;ref&gt;James Wilson: Founding Father, Charles Page Smith, 1956, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson also served from June 1776 on the Committee on Spies, along with Adams, Jefferson, [[John Rutledge]], and [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert R. Livingston]]. They together defined [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;Page, p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=October 2015}}&lt;!-- no source by someone named "Page" appears in this article; is this a citation to Charles Page Smith, perhaps? --&gt;

On October 4, 1779, the Fort Wilson Riot began. After the British had abandoned Philadelphia, Wilson successfully defended at trial 23 people from property seizure and exile by the radical government of Pennsylvania. A mob whipped up by liquor and the writings and speeches of [[Joseph Reed (politician)|Joseph Reed]], president of Pennsylvania's Supreme Executive Council, marched on Congressman Wilson's home at Third and Walnut Streets. Wilson and 35 of his colleagues barricaded themselves in his home, later nicknamed Fort Wilson. In the fighting that ensued, six died, and 17 to 19 were wounded. The city's soldiers, the [[First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry]]&lt;ref name=princeton-1875&gt;{{cite book |last=Pennsylvania National Guard |title=History of the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry |year=1875 |publisher=Princeton University |page=17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=va8-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=British+Cavalry+at+Philadelphia+Summer+1778&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nbEkUrfDMqqrsATAv4DwAw&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=British%20Cavalry%20at%20Philadelphia%20Summer%201778&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Baylor's [[3rd Continental Light Dragoons]], eventually intervened and rescued Wilson and his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Historical Catalogue of The St. Andrew's Society of Philadelphia |date=1907 |publisher=Press of Loughead &amp; Co.

Wilson closely identified with the aristocratic and conservative republican groups, multiplied his business interests, and accelerated his land speculation. He became involved with the [[Illinois-Wabash Company]] during the War for Independence and was made its president in 1780.&lt;ref name="Smith, Charles Page 1956"&gt;Smith, Charles Page. ''James Wilson Founding Father 1742–1798''. Chapel Hill: North Carolina UP, 1956. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He became the company's largest single investor, owning one and a half shares outright and two shares by proxy, totaling over {{convert|1000000|acres}} of land.&lt;ref name="Smith, Charles Page 1956" /&gt; Wilson further expanded his land holdings by cofounding the Canna Company with Mark Bird, Robert Lettis Hooper, and William Bingham in order to sell land along the Susquehanna River in New York.&lt;ref name="Smith, Charles Page 1956" /&gt; Additionally, Wilson individually bought huge quantities of land in Pennsylvania in 1784 and {{convert|56000|acres}} of land in Virginia during the 1780s.&lt;ref name="Smith, Charles Page 1956" /&gt; To round out his holdings, Wilson, in conjunction with Michael and Bernard Gratz, Levi Hollingsworth, Charles Willing, and Dorsey Pentecost purchased {{convert|321000|acres}} of land south of the Ohio River.&lt;ref name="Smith, Charles Page 1956" /&gt; He also took a position as Advocate General for France in America (1779–83), dealing with commercial and maritime matters, and legally defended Loyalists and their sympathizers. He held this post until his death in 1798.

===Constitutional Convention===
One of the most prominent lawyers of his time, Wilson is credited for being the most learned of the [[Framers of the Constitution]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} A fellow delegate in the [[Constitutional Convention of 1787]] in Philadelphia made the following assessment of James Wilson: "Government seems to have been his peculiar study, all the political institutions of the world he knows in detail, and can trace the causes and effects of every revolution from the earliest stages of the Grecian commonwealth down to the present time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/continental/wilson.html |title=Documents from the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention, 1774–1789 |work=loc.gov |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's most lasting impact on the country came as a member of the [[Committee of Detail]], which produced the first draft of the [[United States Constitution]] in 1787 (a year after the death of his first wife). He wanted senators and the president to be popularly elected. He also proposed the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] at the convention, which made only three-fifths of the South's slave population total to be counted for purposes of distributing taxes and apportioning representation in the House and Electoral College. Along with [[James Madison]], he was perhaps the best versed of the framers in the study of political economy. He understood clearly the central problem of [[Dual sovereignty doctrine|dual sovereignty]] (nation and state) and held a vision of an almost limitless future for the United States. Wilson addressed the Convention 168 times.&lt;ref&gt;World Book Encyclopedia, 2003, James Wilson article.&lt;/ref&gt; A witness to Wilson's performance during the convention, Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]], called Wilson's mind "one blaze of light."&lt;ref&gt;"James Wilson: A Forgotten Father," St. John, Gerald J., in The Philadelphia Lawyer, www.philadelphiabar.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Madison and Wilson not only far outdistanced the others at the Convention as political theorists, they were also two of the closest allies in both the convention debates and ratification effort afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Ketcham, Ralph. ''James Madison: A Biography,'' p. 191, American Political Biography Press, Newtown, CT, 1971. {{ISBN|0-945707-33-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not in agreement with all parts of the final, necessarily compromised Constitution, Wilson stumped hard for its adoption, leading Pennsylvania, at its ratifying convention, to become the second state (behind [[Delaware]]) to accept the document.

====Statehouse Yard speech====
His October 6, 1787, "speech in the statehouse yard" (delivered in the courtyard behind [[Independence Hall]]) has been seen as particularly important in setting the terms of the ratification debate, both locally and nationally. It is second in influence behind ''[[The Federalist Papers]]''. It was printed in newspapers and copies of the speech were distributed by [[George Washington]] to generate support for the ratification of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Read, James H. ''Power vs. Liberty: Madison, Hamilton, Wilson and Jefferson,'' p. 93, University Press of Virginia, Charlottesville and London, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8139-1912-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konkle, Burton Alva. "James Wilson and the Constitution," an address to the Law  Academy of Philadelphia, November 14, 1906, published by the academy in 1907 [https://archive.org/stream/jameswilsonconst00konk/jameswilsonconst00konk_djvu.txt Archive.org]. Retrieved July 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, it focused on the fact that there would be a popularly elected national government for the first time. He distinguished "three simple species of government" monarchy, aristocracy, and "a republic or democracy, where the people at large retain the supreme power, and act either collectively or by representation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert G. |last=Natelson |year=2002 |title=A Republic, Not a Democracy? Initiative, Referendum, and the Constitution's Guarantee Clause |journal=[[Texas Law Review]] |volume=80 |issue= |pages=807 [p. 836] |ssrn=1979002 }} from Elliot, Jonathan, The debate in the several state conventions&lt;/ref&gt;  During the speech, Wilson also had harsh criticism for the proposed [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].  Powers over assembly, the press, search and seizure, and others covered in the Bill of Rights were, according to Wilson, not granted in the Enumerated Powers so therefore were unnecessary amendments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W0qaX-_fNV4C&amp;pg=PT97 The American Revolution: A Concise History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lehrmaninstitute.org/history/BillofRights.html Bill of Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912913513351?journalCode=prqb James Wilson versus the Bill of Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mWu7GGgkDJUC&amp;pg=PA113 Thomas Jefferson and Executive Power]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson was later instrumental in the redrafting of the [[Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776]], leading the group in favor of a new constitution, and entering into an agreement with [[William Findley]] (leader of the Constitutionalist Party) that limited the partisan feeling that had previously characterized Pennsylvanian politics.

==Supreme Court career and final years==
[[George Washington]] nominated Wilson to be an [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court]] on September 24, 1789, after the court was organized under the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]]. The [[United States Senate]] confirmed his appointment on September 26, 1789, and Washington commissioned Wilson on September 29, 1789. Only nine cases were heard by the court from his appointment in 1789 until his death in 1798.

He became the first professor of law at the [[College of Philadelphia]] in 1790—only the second at any academic institution in the United States—in which he mostly ignored the practical matters of legal training. Like many of his educated contemporaries, he viewed the academic study of law as a branch of a general cultured education, rather than solely as a prelude to a profession.

Wilson broke off his first course of law lectures in April 1791 to attend to his duties as Supreme Court justice on circuit. He appears to have begun a second-year course in late 1791 or in early 1792 (by which time the College of Philadelphia had been merged into the [[University of Pennsylvania]]), but at some unrecorded point the lectures stopped again and were never resumed. They were not published (except for the first) until after his death, in an edition produced by his son, [[Bird Wilson]], in 1804. The [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]] in Philadelphia officially traces its foundation to Wilson's lectures.

Wilson's last and final years were marked by financial failures. He assumed heavy debts investing in land that became liabilities with the onset of the [[Panic of 1796–1797]]. Of note was the failure in Pennsylvania with [[Theophilus Cazenove]]. In debt, Wilson was briefly imprisoned in a [[debtors' prison]] in [[Burlington, New Jersey]]. His son paid the debt, but Wilson went to [[North Carolina]] to escape other creditors. He was again briefly [[Prison|imprisoned]], but continued his duties on the Federal judicial circuit. In 1798, he suffered a bout of [[malaria]] and then died of a [[stroke]] at the age of 55, while visiting a friend in [[Edenton, North Carolina]]. He was buried in the Johnston cemetery on [[Hayes Plantation]] near Edenton, but was reinterred in 1906 at [[Christ Church (Philadelphia)|Christ Churchyard]], Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.philadelphiabar.org/page/TPLWinter04JamesWilson?appNum=2&amp;wosid=dFdfEaGabKlZdIHJS33VH0 |title=James Wilson: A Forgotten Father |first=G. J. |last=St. John |quote=During the dedication of Pennsylvania's new capitol building in Harrisburg, [[Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] singled out James Wilson for special praise ...

{{quote|Tracing over the events of Wilson's life, we are impressed by the lucid quality of his mind. With this went a restless energy and insatiable ambition, an almost frightening vitality that turned with undiminished energy and enthusiasm to new tasks and new ventures. Yet, when all has been said, the inner man remains, despite our probings, an enigma.|Charles Page Smith&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1956), p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Jurisprudence==
In the lectures mentioned above, James Wilson, among the first of American legal philosophers, worked through in more detail some of the thinking suggested in the opinions issuing at that time from the Supreme Court. He felt, in fact, compelled to begin by spending some time in arguing out the justification of the appropriateness of his undertaking a course of lectures. But he assures his students that: "When I deliver my sentiments from this chair, they shall be my honest sentiments: when I deliver them from the bench, they shall be nothing more. In both places I shall make―because I mean to support―the claim to integrity: in neither shall I make―because, in neither, can I support―the claim to infallibility." (First lecture, 1804 Philadelphia ed.)

With this, he raises the most important question of the era: having acted upon revolutionary principles in setting up the new country, "Why should we not teach our children those principles, upon which we ourselves have thought and acted? Ought we to instil into their tender minds a theory, especially if unfounded, which is contradictory to our own practice, built on the most solid foundation? Why should we reduce them to the cruel dilemma of condemning, either those principles which they have been taught to believe, or those persons whom they have been taught to revere?" (First lecture.)

That this is no mere academic question is revealed with a cursory review of any number of early Supreme Court opinions. Perhaps it is best here to quote the opening of Justice Wilson's opinion in ''[[Chisholm v. State of Georgia]]'', 2 U.S. 419 (1793), one of the most momentous decisions in American history: "This is a case of uncommon magnitude. One of the parties to it is a State; certainly respectable, claiming to be sovereign. The question to be determined is, whether this State, so respectable, and whose claim soars so high, is amenable to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States? This question, important in itself, will depend on others, more important still; and, may, perhaps, be ultimately resolved into one, no less radical than this 'do the people of the United States form a Nation?'"

In order to arrive at an answer to this question, one that would provide the foundation for the United States of America, Wilson knew that legal thinkers had to resolve in their minds clearly the question of the difference between "the principles of the constitutions and governments and laws of the United States, and the republics, of which they are formed" and the "constitution and government and laws of England." He made it quite clear that he thought the American items to be "materially better." (First lecture.)

'''John M. Allen''' (? – 12 February 1847) was a soldier and the first mayor of Galveston.

== Biography ==
[[File:Major John M. Allen, Galveston, Texas Historical Marker (8177778993).jpg|thumb|Historical marker ([[cenotaph]]) for Allen]]
John M. Allen was born in [[Kentucky]]. He fought in support of the [[Greek independence]] from Turkey as a volunteer in the [[United States Navy]].  [[Lord Byron]] died in [[Missolonghi]] in Allen’s presence. He volunteered with the Texans, first with the Tampico Expedition in 1835, and with the Texas Army after he returned from Mexico late in the year. He received a commission as captain of an infantry unit and participated in the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. He assumed command of a naval ship after independence and headed a recruiting mission in the United States until his release from service on 2 December 1836.  The Republic of Texas granted to him a [[Spanish customary units#League (unit of land)|league]] and [[Spanish customary units#Labor (unit of land)|labor]] for his military service.&lt;ref name=hto&gt;{{cite web|series=Handbook of Texas Online|first=Wesley N.|last= Laing|title=ALLEN, JOHN M.|access-date=14 September 2018|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fal22|date=9 June 2010|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen was the first mayor of [[Galveston, Texas]], elected for the post first in 1839. He served consecutive one-year terms through 1846.&lt;ref name=hto/&gt; He became a party to a charter war in 1840 when he transported the Galveston archives to his home. He withstood a challenge by Samuel May Williams and other persons with financial interests in the Galveston City Company. Allen commandeered two cannons to guard his home and the municipal archives, though they were returned to the city and Allen resumed his term as mayor.&lt;ref name=hto/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=111|last=Henson|first=Margaret Swett|title=Samuel May Williams: Early Texas Entrepreneur|publisher=Texas A &amp; M University Press|location=College Station, TX|year=1976|via=archive.org|registration=yes|url=https://archive.org/stream/samuelmaywilliam00hens#page/n0|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen served as a United States Marshall from 1846 until his death the next year.&lt;ref name=hto/&gt;

'''Malcolm Struan Tonnochy''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese:]] 杜老誌) was an [[Anglo-Indian]] colonial major official serving in [[British India]] and &lt;!--colony secretary?--&gt;in [[Hong Kong]]. He was acting [[Governor of Hong Kong]] in March 1882.

==Early years==

Tonnochy was born in [[Bengal, India]] in December 1841 to Thomas Tonnochy (a colonial collector in [[Bulundshahr]]) and Caroline Kemball. He was of [[Scotland|Scottish]] and [[India]]n extraction: his paternal grandfather was a [[Scot]] ([[Bengal Army]] [[Sergeant Major]] [[Thomas Tonnochie]]) and his paternal grandmother, Catharine, was probably Indian. His maternal grandfather was a Conductor of Ordnance and maternal grandmother most likely Indian too.
He was sent to England for education at [[Blackheath Proprietary School]] followed by [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=TNCY860MS|name=Tonnochy, Malcolm Struan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial Service in Hong Kong==
It seems that Tonnochy did not complete his studies at Cambridge, choosing instead to try for a new cadetship in the [[Hong Kong]] Civil Service, by competitive examination in 1862. In this he was successful, along with fellow candidates [[Cecil Clementi Smith]] and Walter Meredith Deane, the three of them comprising the first appointments on merit in a service that was beginning to modernise.&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, Steve. Governing Hong Kong: Administrative Officers from the 19th Century to the Hand-over to China, 1862-1997. London: I.B. Tauris, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Tonnochy worked his way up to hold many posts including Coroner, Assistant Harbour Master, Police Magistrate, acting [[Financial Secretary (Hong Kong)|Colonial Treasurer]] (when [[James Russell (judge)|James Russell]] was absent), acting [[Chief Secretary for Administration|Colonial Secretary]] and as judge in the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Admiralty court|Vice Admiralty Court of Hong Kong]] from 1879 to 1882. From 1876 to 1882 he was Superintendent of [[Victoria Gaol]] (under [[Hong Kong Police]] 1876-1879 and [[Hong Kong Correctional Services]] from 1879 to 1882). He was acting Administrator (i.e. Governor) for two short periods, in 1881 during the absence of [[John_Pope_Hennessy|Sir John Pope Hennessy]] in Peking, and in 1882 after Hennessy left office.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: The London and China Telegraph, January 22, 1883, p74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Tonnochy was unmarried and died aged 41 after serving as acting Administrator of Hong Kong in early 1882. Tonnochy is buried at [[Hong Kong Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSsr=4320&amp;GScid=2177241&amp;GRid=36589934&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==

Unlike most colonial officials in Hong Kong at the time, Tonnochy was never honoured with any titles. The only place that bears his name is [[Tonnochy Road]] in [[Wan Chai]]. '''Club Tonnochy''' and '''Tonnochy Night Club''' are named and located on the street named for him.

While Monis had a warrant out for his arrest in [[Iran]], he sought political asylum in [[Australia]] in 1996,&lt;ref name= BBCDamaged/&gt; which was granted in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-16/iranian-man-haron-monis-named-as-man-behind-sydney-siege/5969246 |title= Sydney siege: Man behind Martin Place stand-off was Iranian Man Haron Monis, who had violent criminal history |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work= ABC News |date= 16 December 2014 |first1= Lorna |last1= Knowles |accessdate= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monis variously promoted himself as an Iranian intelligence official, a political activist, a spiritual healer and expert in [[black magic]], an [[outlaw bikie]] and a Muslim cleric.&lt;ref name= abcschizo/&gt; He told a psychiatrist who diagnosed him with [[schizophrenia]] that he had to change his name for "security reasons," variously calling himself "Michael Hayson Mavros",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/170215_Martin_Place_Siege_Review_1.pdf (p. 72)&lt;/ref&gt; "Sheikh Haron",&lt;ref name= ABCMcNally/&gt; and "Ayatollah Mohammed Manteghi Boroujerdi".&lt;ref name= abcschizo/&gt;&lt;ref name="SMHElliot"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/martin-place-gunman-deranged-deluded-and-dangerous-20141216-128j42.html |title= Martin Place gunman deranged, deluded and dangerous |work= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= 16 December 2014 |last= Elliot |first= Tim |publisher= Fairfax Media |accessdate= 21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monis ran a "spiritual healing" business, telling some women that they needed to submit to sexual molestation to receive treatment. In 2014, Monis was charged with being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, as well as over 40 counts of sexual assault.&lt;ref name= 730-may25/&gt;&lt;ref name= abcaccessory/&gt; At the time of his death, he had recently converted from [[Shia Islam]] to [[Sunni Islam]], and attended Islamist rallies promoting conspiracy theories about Australian security agencies.&lt;ref name= abcaccessory/&gt;&lt;ref name= annedavies/&gt; While on bail, and facing a likely lengthy imprisonment,&lt;ref name= 730-may25/&gt; he declared allegiance to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref name="GuardianSafi"&gt;{{cite news |last= Safi |first= Michael |last2= Quinn |first2= Ben |url= https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/dec/15/man-haron-monis-sydney-siege-suspect |title= Man Haron Monis: fringe figure whose crime record and erratic behaviour made him notorious |work= [[The Guardian]] |date= 16 December 2014 |accessdate= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in Iran==
Monis was born in [[Borujerd]], [[Iran]] on 19 May 1964.&lt;ref name= SMHElliot/&gt; He published a book of poetry, ''Inside and Out'' or ''Daroon va Boroon'' ({{lang-fa|درون و برون}}), in 1996 in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/world/2014/12/141215_l12_sydney_shaikh_haroon |title= Who was the main suspect of the hostage? |date= 15 December 2014 |language= Persian |website= [[BBC Persian]] |publisher= British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mamouri"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://theconversation.com/sydney-siege-shows-the-rise-of-a-new-form-of-extremism-35494 |title= Sydney siege shows the rise of a new form of extremism |work= [[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |date= 16 December 2014 |last= Mamouri |first= Ali |accessdate= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It did not sell well, which disappointed Monis.  In the 1990s, Monis ran a company called ''Salhani Amal'' ({{lang-fa|صالحان عمل}}), which he used to buy discounted tyres from the Iranian government and re-sell them on the black market.  He also ran a charity scam to avoid paying tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Bibby |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/lindt-cafe-siege-gunman-once-had-luxurious-life-in-tehran-funded-by-scam-involving-iranian-government-20150904-gjffaj.html |title=Lindt Cafe siege gunman once had luxurious life in Tehran funded by scam involving Iranian government |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=2015-09-04 |accessdate=2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, using the pseudonym Ayatollah Manteghi Boroujerdi,&lt;ref name= SMHElliot/&gt; he claimed in an interview with [[Radio National|ABC Radio National's]] ''The Religion Report'' that he had been involved with the Iranian [[Ministry of Intelligence|ministry of intelligence and security]], and that his criticism of the regime and secret information he possessed had resulted in his persecution as well as the detention of his wife and children. During an ABC Radio interview, he claimed that his family's detention was a result of views the Iranian government believed to be "dangerously liberal".&lt;ref name= RN/&gt; David Ruteledge, the journalist who interviewed him, described this as "a little bit dramatic."&lt;ref name= 730-may25/&gt;

Esmaeil Ahmadi-Moghaddam, [[Law Enforcement Force of Islamic Republic of Iran|Iran's chief of police]], told reporters that Monis had "a dark and long history of [[violent crime]] and [[fraud]]"&lt;ref name="Mehr News Agency"&gt;{{cite web |title= Iran’s Interpol ready to cooperate on Sydney case |url= http://en.mehrnews.com/detail/News/105117 |website= [[Mehr News Agency]] |date= 16 December 2014 |accessdate= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Iran and had run a travel agency in 1996, before fleeing to [[Malaysia]] and then Australia.

Iran's official [[Islamic Republic News Agency]] states that he was "under prosecution by the [[Interpol]]" and Iran provided information to the [[Australian government]] about his criminal record, mental and spiritual status.

He applied for a protection visa when his business visa expired, and was granted a bridging visa while the protection visa application was assessed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/170215_Martin_Place_Siege_Review_1.pdf (p. 21)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1997 to 2000, Monis held a security guard licence, which would have let him carry a pistol between March and June 1997.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/170215_Martin_Place_Siege_Review_1.pdf (p. 45)&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2000, he chained himself to a pole at [[Parliament House, Sydney]], and went on a one-day hunger strike to draw attention to his cause.&lt;ref name="west-hungerstrike"&gt;{{cite news |title= Heat Puts Paid To Iran Cleric's Hunger Strike |work= The West Australian |author= Ruse, Ben |quote= Armed with just a sleeping bag and some bottled water, Iranian immigrant Ayatollah Manteghi Boroujerdi had chained himself to a pole yesterday afternoon.

On 16 September 2002, Monis changed his name to Michael Hayson Mavros.&lt;ref name= siege-review-p72/&gt; While he was known as Mavros, he seemed to be 'embracing a secular life'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/170215_Martin_Place_Siege_Review_1.pdf (p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt;

He gained Australian citizenship in 2004.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

On 21 September 2006, he changed his name to Man Haron Monis.&lt;ref name= siege-review-p72&gt;[https://www.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/170215_Martin_Place_Siege_Review_1.pdf Martin Place Siege Review] (p. 72) PDF www.dpmc.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt;

Monis was investigated by the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] four times, and there were more than 40 calls to ASIO's [[National Security Hotline (Australia)|National Security Hotline]].&lt;ref name="730-may25"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4242253.htm|title= Sydney siege inquest builds picture of Man Haron Monis' 'bizarre, delusional' world|work= [[7.30]]|date= 25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family of his partner called the National Security Hotline in 2010 and were advised Monis "wasn't a threat".&lt;ref name= abc3june/&gt; Monis had been on the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]]'s watch-list in 2008 and 2009, but was dropped off the list for reasons that were not specified.&lt;ref name="dropped off watch list"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://news.yahoo.com/australia-pm-lays-flowers-memorials-victims-051949987.html|title= Aussie leader: Siege gunman dropped off watch list|date= 16 December 2014|work= Yahoo News|accessdate= 17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, in [[Granville, New South Wales|Granville, NSW]], Monis gave a lecture calling for an Islamic society and taunting foreign governments saying, "your intelligence service is not working properly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/taped-granville-lectures-give-glimpse-inside-the-crazed-mind-of-sydney-terrorist-man-haron-monis/story-fni0cx12-1227172184191 |title= Taped Granville lectures give glimpse inside the crazed mind of Sydney terrorist Man Haron Monis |author= Auerbach, Taylor |date= 2 January 2015 |work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate= 2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monis lived in a flat with a housemate for six months in 1998. Monis said he was a senior member of the clergy in Iran, always locked his bedroom door, even when he went to the bathroom, and told his housemate not to bring friends over and not to answer the door if anyone knocked.&lt;ref name="abc3june"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-03/monis-borrowed-money-from-flatmate/6517838|title= Sydney siege inquest: Family of Man Haron Monis's girlfriend reported him to the National Security Hotline|work= ABC News|date= 3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monis said that he was in "financial hardship" and borrowed payments amounting to $9,000 - which were never repaid.

===Spouses===
In 2003, Monis dated Amanda Morsy for about six months, telling her he was Romanian, giving her gold necklaces and driving her to dates in a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], convertible [[Peugeot]] and a [[Jeep]]. Monis was unable to be contacted after 8 pm, claiming he was busy with his "spiritual consultation" business. Morsy described him as "secretive", "very reserved" and "formal" and wanting to "fit in" - and broke the relationship off after her family expresses reservations about his personality.&lt;ref name= smh3june/&gt;

In 2003, Monis married a woman who was a client of his black magic business, though always kept his blinds closed, and told people at a Sydney mosque that he had a wife in Iran.&lt;ref name= 730-may25/&gt;

In July 2011, Monis was charged at a [[St Marys, New South Wales|St Mary's]] police station for intimidation of his ex-wife, following a confrontation in a [[McDonald's]] car park in [[Green Valley, New South Wales|Green Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Mazoe Ford |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-17/sydney-siege-man-haron-monis-ex-partner-feared-shooting/5973236 |title= Sydney siege: Man Haron Monis's ex-partner Noleen Hayson Pal feared he would shoot her |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work= ABC News |date= 17 December 2014 |accessdate= 18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ex-wife claimed Monis had threatened to shoot her and told her that he held a gun licence.

In 2010, the family of Amirah Droudis reported Monis to the National Security Hotline because they found his behaviour strange. He was secretive with the family and always refused to have his photo taken even at Christmas. He gave them the appearance of having money and being "very generous" but vague about where he worked. They described him as "rarely forthcoming with any direct or detailed answers."&lt;ref name= abc3june/&gt;

Social worker Sylvia Martin talked with Monis during a meeting with his former wife in 2012. She described Monis as prone to "[[grandiosity]]" and a "hero in his own story" describing him as "capable of [[narcissism]] and also capable of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]]." His ex-wife said that Monis had "intimidated, duped and emotionally manipulated her" and that around 2007 he "became more strict" and told her to wear a veil, and restricted her from "singing and dancing" allegedly telling her "I'm doing it for Islam ... I want to be a martyr".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/lindt-cafe-siege-gunman-man-haron-monis-wanted-to-be-a-hero-in-his-own-story-inquest-hears-20150601-ghdyh9.html|title= Lindt Cafe siege: Gunman Man Haron Monis wanted to be 'a hero in his own story', inquest hears|work= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Accessory to murder charge====
On 21 April 2013, Monis' ex-wife's  body was found stabbed 17 times and alight in a [[Werrington, New South Wales|Werrington]] apartment stairwell. Monis' girlfriend Amirah Droudis was formally charged with murder, and on 15 November 2013, Monis was charged by [[NSW Police]] with being an [[accessory before the fact]] and an [[accessory after the fact]] to the murder.&lt;ref name="abcaccessory"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-22/self-styled-muslim-sheikh-faces-court-on-accessory-to-murder-ch/5111744 |title= Self-styled Muslim sheikh faces court on accessory to murder charge |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work= ABC News |date= 22 November 2013 |agency= AAP |accessdate= 8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December 2013, Monis and Amirah appeared before [[Magistrate]] William Pierce at [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]] Local Court where they were granted bail.&lt;ref&gt;12 December 2013 court list Penrith Magistrate Court&lt;/ref&gt; The magistrate said there were significant flaws in the Crown's case against the pair and that "It is a weak case".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/murder-case-against-man-haron-monis-and-partner-weak-magistrate/story-e6frg6nf-1226781538379 |title= Murder case against Man Haron Monis and partner weak: magistrate |publisher= News Limited |work= The Australian |date= 12 December 2013 |agency= AAP |accessdate= 8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutor Brian Royce said Monis' claims that the [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran)|Iranian Secret Police]] and the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO) were trying to frame him for the murder were fanciful. Magistrate Pierce said all theories needed to be examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= 13 December 2013 |title= Hate sheikh Man Haron Monis and girlfriend Amirah Droudis granted bail on murder charges |url= http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/hate-sheik-man-horan-monis-and-girlfriend-amirzh-droudis-granted-bail-on-murder-charges/story-fni0cx12-1226781623998 |work= The Daily Telegraph |publisher= News Corp |accessdate= 21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2014, Monis appeared at [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]] Local Court and, after informing magistrate Joan Baptie that he was representing himself, began discussing documents that he claimed were held by ASIO. He also claimed that ASIO was "conspiring against him" as they wanted him jailed. Magistrate Baptie told Monis that she had no power to order the release of documents held by ASIO and "advised him to stop talking because he would harm his defence". Monis staged a protest outside the court, following the adjournment of the case, "wearing chains and holding a sign claiming he has been tortured in custody". He was quoted as saying: "This is not a criminal case. This is a political case."&lt;ref name="ABCMcNally"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-22/controversial-sheik-haron-faces-accessory-to-ex-wife27s-murder/5212862 |title= Controversial Sheikh Haron faces accessory to ex-wife's murder charge |publisher= [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |work= ABC News |date= 22 January 2014 |last= McNally |first= Lucy |accessdate= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims of membership of Iranian Intelligence===
Monis told individuals in Australia, including his lawyers, that he had worked for the [[Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security]] and had knowledge about Iran's clandestine operations, and that it was for this reason he fled Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/martin-place-gunman-man-haron-moniss-secret-iranian-life-20141222-12c9ny.html|title= Martin Place gunman Man Haron Monis's secret Iranian life|work= The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an Iranian embassy official stated Monis' claim to have worked in intelligence and security in Iran was a lie.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/sydney-siege-inside-the-mind-of-cbd-terrorist-man-haron-monis/story-e6frg6z6-1227162502613 {{Subscription required|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of fabricated cleric status===
Monis proclaimed himself to be a [[Akhoond|Shia cleric]].&lt;ref name="BBCDamaged"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-30484419 |title= Man Haron Monis: 'Damaged' and 'unstable' |work= [[BBC]] |date= 16 December 2014 |publisher= British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= SMHElliot/&gt;&lt;ref name="RN"&gt;{{cite episode |title= New Cardinals for Rome, George Bush, Muslims in Australia |series= The Religion Report |credits= Presenter: Stephen Crittenden |network= Radio National |airdate= 31 January 2001 |transcript= Transcript |transcripturl= http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/religionreport/new-cardinals-for-rome-george-bush-muslims-in/3478556#transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2007, [[Australian Federation of Islamic Councils]] head Ikebal Patel said no Islamic community leaders knew anything about Monis and believed he "could be a fake deliberately stirring up [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic sentiment]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/defence/sheik-faked-to-stir-up-ill-feeling/story-e6frg8yo-1111115203676 |title= Sheik 'faked' to stir up ill-feeling |publisher= News Limited |work= [[The Australian]] |date= 28 December 2007 |last= Kerbaj |first= Richard |accessdate= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 January 2008, Australia's senior Shia leader and head of [[Islamic organisations in Australia|Supreme Islamic Shia Council of Australia]], Kamal Mousselmani, told ''[[The Australian]]'' that Monis "was not a genuine Shia spiritual leader" and "there are no [[ayatollah]]s in Australia." He urged Federal government officials to investigate his identity. "From the way he writes his [[fatwa]]s (or religious edicts), I don't think he is [[Shia Muslim]]", he added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/defence/call-to-probe-mystery-shia-cleric/story-e6frg8yx-1111115413357 |title= Call to probe mystery Shia cleric |publisher= News Limited |work= [[The Australian]] |date= 28 January 2008 |last= Kerbaj |first= Richard |accessdate= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychiatric assessment===
In 2010 Monis was [[emergency psychiatry|involuntarily hospitalised]] at [[Canterbury Hospital]] after displaying bizarre and erratic behaviour in a parking lot in [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]]. A psychiatrist who assessed Monis said she believed he had chronic schizophrenia and needed to be on anti-psychotic medication. Monis stated that he had been forced to close his spiritual business, was $20,000 in debt, and had to change his name for "security reasons."&lt;ref name="abcschizo"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-27/sydney-siege-inquest-man-haron-monis-schizophrenia-bail/6499862|title= Sydney siege inquest: Prosecutors move to stop inquiry considering Man Haron Monis's bail freedom|work= ABC News|date= 27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monis was treated by two different psychiatrists who didn't know about the other and he was giving them different information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-28/sydney-siege-inquest-man-monis-thought-people-read-his-mind/6502890|title= Sydney siege inquest: Man Haron Monis thought 'people could read his mind', inquiry told|work= ABC News|date= 28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described as "quite guarded and reluctant to disclose too much information" and refused to give his phone number and home address. He was concerned that "ASIO and police were following him... and that some people could read his mind," according to a psychologist who grew up in Iran, who diagnosed him with [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive disorder]]. He avoided buying medication for mental illness with his [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] card to conceal his use of medication from authorities.

One solicitor said that Monis seemed paranoid and would often speak with his hand over his mouth because he thought people "watching him" might be able to lip read.&lt;ref name="abc1june"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-01/sydney-siege-gunman-monis-wanted-to-be-hero-in-his-own-story/6510702|title= Sydney siege inquest: Man Haron Monis wanted to be 'hero in his own story'|work= ABC News|date= 1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hate mail campaign===
Monis, together with Amirah Droudis, undertook a campaign protesting against the presence of Australian troops in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], by writing letters to the families of soldiers killed there, in which he called the soldiers murderers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2013/09/06/sheik-says-letters-were-flowers-advice |title= Sheik says letters were flowers of advice |publisher= Special Broadcasting Service |work= SBS News |date= 6 September 2013 |author= Staff |accessdate= 8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and urged the soldiers' families to petition the government to remove its troops from Afghanistan. According to Justice [[Dyson Heydon]] of the High Court, the letters compared "the (deceased soldier) son to a pig and to a dirty animal. It calls the son's body 'contaminated'. It refers to it as 'the dirty body of a pig'. It describes Hitler as not inferior to the son in moral merit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Mason |first= David |url= https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/casenote-monis-v-queen-2013-hca-4-1|title= Casenote: Monis v The Queen [2013] HCA 4|publisher= [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] - www.humanrights.gov.au |date= 6 March 2013 |format = PDF and Word |accessdate= 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monis was arrested on charges of "using a postal or similar service to menace, harass or cause offence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2008/s2739013.htm |title= 'Hate mail' suspect protests against 'misinterpretation' |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work= [[Lateline]] |date= 22 November 2013 |last= Hoerr |first= Karl |accessdate= 8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Droudis received a 2-year good-behaviour bond for "assisting Monis in sending the letters".

===Court cases===
{{main|Monis v The Queen}}
On 10 November 2009, Monis appeared in court and claimed through his lawyers to be a peace activist. He later chained himself to the courthouse in protest over the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2009/11/10/controversial-sheik-chains-outside-court |title= Controversial Sheik in chains outside court |publisher= Special Broadcasting Service |work= SBS News |date= 10 November 2009 |agency= AAP |accessdate= 8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monis was subsequently barred by the courts from expanding his protest to include letters to [[UK]] soldiers' families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2010/02/09/sheik-banned-sending-offensive-mail |title= Sheik banned from sending offensive mail |publisher= Special Broadcasting Service |work= SBS News |date= 9 February 2010 |agency= AAP |accessdate= 8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an inquest, lawyer Chris Murphy said that Monis claimed to be contacting families to recruit "people who had suffered loss in war" to join his cause. Murphy said "He didn't strike me as very intelligent." Monis chained himself to the courthouse against the directions of lawyers, and Murphy said "He was entirely self absorbed with his performance ... my recollection is he held a pen in the air and said 'this is my sword'." Lawyers described Monis as a "pest" and a "dickhead".&lt;ref name="abc29may"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-29/lindt-cafe-siege-man-haron-monis-lawyers-give-evidence/6506312|title= Sydney siege inquest: Lawyer says Man Haron Monis was a pest and not very intelligent|work= ABC News|date= 29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manny Conditsis said that conversations with Monis were "draining and exhausting." Monis expressed conspiracy theories about ASIO, claiming that families of dead soldiers were not upset at his letters, but "ASIO was putting them up to it." He said "Monis was a very proud man," who cried "like a baby" in prison. Another lawyer said he always wanted to be "the centre of attention" in the media.&lt;ref name= abc29may/&gt;

In December 2011, Monis appeared before the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] in Sydney arguing that the charges against him were invalid because they infringed  his implied constitutional freedom of political communication, but the three-judge panel unanimously dismissed his case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-06/cleric-loses-appeal-over-dead-soldier-hate-mail/3715612 |title= Cleric loses appeal over dead soldier hate mail |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work= ABC News |date= 6 December 2011 |agency= AAP |accessdate= 8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon further appeal to the [[High Court of Australia]], the six-judge panel split 3–3 over the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/lawreport/rundle-street-preachers/4548266#transcript |title= High court divided on freedom of speech |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work= Law Report |date= 5 March 2013 |last= Carrick |first= Damien |network= Radio National |accessdate= 8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[High Court of Australia]] normally comprises seven judges, one seat was vacant and as yet unfilled at the time Monis's case appeared before the court. Failing to achieve a majority vote in Monis's favour, the lower court's unanimous decision was left to stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-27/high-court-decision/4542482 |title= High Court dismisses appeal over letters to dead soldiers' families |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work= ABC News |date= 27 February 2013 |last= Byrne |first= Elizabeth |accessdate= 8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December 2014, Monis' [[appeal]] against his conviction for criminal use of the postal service resulted in a split decision of the High Court.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/15/sydney-hostage-crisis_n_6327220.html |title= Sydney Hostage Crisis Over After Police Storm Cafe |work= The Huffington Post |accessdate= 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision related to his protest against the presence of Australian troops in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], which he expressed by sending letters to the families of soldiers killed there in which he called the soldiers murderers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= AAP|date= 6 September 2013|title= Sheik says letters were flowers of advice |url= http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2013/09/06/sheik-says-letters-were-flowers-advice |work= SBS News |publisher= sbs.com.au |accessdate= 8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and urged the families to petition the government to remove its troops from Afghanistan. One of the letters compared a dead soldier to a pig and called his body "contaminated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/casenote-monis-v-queen-2013-hca-4-1|title= Casenote: Monis v The Queen [2013] HCA 4|work= humanrights.gov.au|accessdate= 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sent similar letters to the families of British soldiers and the mother&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/11294514/Sydney-siege-gunman-named-as-Man-Haron-Monis.html|title= Sydney siege gunman named as Man Haron Monis|author= Jonathan Pearlman in Sydney|date= 15 December 2014|work= Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate= 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a government official killed by a bombing in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia.

===Rebels Motorcycle Club===
Monis attempted to join the [[Rebels Motorcycle Club]] sometime in 2012 or 2013, and was photographed with a "1%" logo representing [[outlaw motorcycle club]]s. Club members reportedly stated "no one really liked him" and described him as "strange and weird" and said "He would say he had a lot of money, but then he didn't have any." He was kicked out of the club and Rebels took his motorbike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/lindt-cafe-siege-inquest-man-haron-monis-wanted-to-be-a-rebels-bikie-20150525-gh93k4.html|title= Lindt cafe siege inquest: Man Haron Monis wanted to be a Rebels bikie|work= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-25/sydney-siege-inquest-man-monis-lindt-cafe-martin-place/6493752|title= Sydney siege inquest: Hostage taker Man Haron Monis tried to join Rebels bikie gang, rejected as 'weird'|date= 25 May 2015|publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual assault charges===
Monis ran a "spiritual healing" business and promoted himself as a clairvoyant an expert in "astrology, numerology, meditation and black magic" services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-04-14/spiritual-healer-arrested-for-sexual-assault/5388332 |title= 'Spiritual healer' refused bail over alleged 2002 sexual assaults at Wentworthville in Sydney's west |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work= ABC News |date= 14 April 2014 |accessdate= 14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business has been described as a front for sexual advances on vulnerable women, who were told that they could only receive treatment if they were undressed and massaged on the breasts and genitals.&lt;ref name= 730-may25/&gt; With some women, he threatened black magic curses if they did not submit to sex with him.

On 14 March 2014, Monis was arrested and charged with sexually and indecently assaulting a young woman who went to his consultancy in [[Wentworthville, New South Wales]], for "spiritual healing", after seeing an advertisement in a local newspaper. Seven months later, on 13 October 2014, a further 40 charges were added, including 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault, allegedly committed against six more women who had visited his business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.skynews.com.au/news/local/sydney/2014/10/13/40-more-charges-against--spiritual-healer-.html |title= 40 more charges against 'spiritual healer' |work= [[Sky News Australia]] |date= 13 October 2014 |accessdate= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political activity===
Monis promoted himself as a [[peace activist]], and told his lawyers that his [[hate-mail]] campaign was to make families of dead soldiers support peace.

Commercial news media in Sydney often condemned Monis for making videos with his girlfriend narrating, expressing happiness about the [[Holocaust]] and [[9/11]] and attacking rape victims.&lt;ref name= SMHElliot/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/amirah-droudis-girlfriend-of-gunman-man-haron-monis-appears-in-vile-youtube-videos/story-fnj3rq0y-1227158281328|title= Amirah Droudis, girlfriend of gunman Man Haron Monis, appears in vile YouTube videos|work= news.com.au|date= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monis hated [[Seven Network|Channel Seven]] for their coverage of the [[Muhamed Haneef]] affair,&lt;ref name="smh3june"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sydney-siege-man-monis-claimed-sunrise-host-david-koch-was-a-killer-and-a-terrorist-20150602-gher8n.html|title= Sydney siege: Man Monis claimed Sunrise host David Koch was 'a killer and a terrorist'|author= Louise Hall|date= 3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ran aggressive protests outside their studios. He once rushed at television hosts [[Melissa Doyle]] and [[David Koch (television presenter)|David Koch]] in [[Martin Place]] yelling, "You are a killer and a terrorist." Monis would often put on clerical garb and chain himself to a post visible from the Channel Seven live studio, handing out pamphlets declaring there was a "[[War on Islam]]" - leading the network to move studios when broadcasting the Sunrise program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/02/sydney-siege-inquest-gunman-accused-tv-hosts-of-being-killers-and-terrorists|title= Sydney siege inquest: gunman accused TV hosts of being 'killers and terrorists'|work= The Guardian|date= 2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Haneef]] affair, in which a doctor was accused of aiding terrorists, Monis handed out pamphlets against Sunrise alleging that they told "Muslim doctors" that "If you want to kill people, why not use the tools of your own trade like a plague or a disease or something?"&lt;ref name= smh3june/&gt; Monis made complaints to Channel Seven and the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]], which were dismissed.

[[Kevin Rudd]] publicised his consideration of changes to citizenship laws during the prosecution of Monis's letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/kevin-rudd-outraged-at-sheiks-letters/story-e6freuy9-1225790202274|title= Kevin Rudd outraged at sheik's letters|date= 23 October 2009|work= Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/kevin-rudd-to-ponder-citizenship-laws-as-sheik-haron-accused-of-harassing-dead-digger-families/story-e6freuy9-1225789920643|title= Kevin Rudd to ponder citizenship laws as Sheik Haron accused of harassing dead Digger families|work= Daily Telegraph|date= 22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monis used social media to attack politicians including then Australian Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]] and former Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]]. His criticisms of Abbott, from 2013, related to Australia's military presence in Afghanistan. On 5 December 2014, he referred to a statement made by Rudd on changing immigration laws after Monis had been charged with seven counts of harassment. Before it was taken down, on 15 December 2014, Monis's [[Facebook]] account had 14,000 "[[like button|likes]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/martin-place-siege-man-haron-monis-has-long-history-of-hatred-of-politicians-20141215-127t01.html |title= Martin Place siege: Man Haron Monis has long history of hatred of politicians |work= [[The Age]] |date= 16 December 2014 |last= Wroe |first= David |last2= Massola |first2= James |last3= Aston |first3= Heath |publisher= Fairfax Media |accessdate= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monis featured a photograph of [[Osama bin Laden]] on his website in 2008.&lt;ref name= abc3june/&gt;

It has been reported that Monis was radicalised by members of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir#Australia|Hizb ut-Tahrir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/martin-place-terrorist-man-haron-moniss-links-with-extremist-group-hizb-ut-tahrir-revealed/story-fni0cx12-1227172138089 |title= Martin Place terrorist Man Haron Monis’s links with extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir revealed |author= Auerbach, Taylor |date= 2 January 2015 |work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate= 2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014 Monis attended a presentation by Uthman Badar and [[Wassim Doureihi]] of Hizb ut-Tahrir which was held in response to an earlier Uthman Badar lecture titled 'Honour Killings are Morally Justified', which was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/lindt-cafe-gunman-man-haron-monis-was-honoured-guest-at-hizb-ut-tahrirs-lakemba-hate-fest/story-fnpn118l-1227265393578 |title=Lindt cafe gunman Man Haron Monis was honoured guest at Hizb ut-Tahrir’s Lakemba hate-fest |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=17 March 2015 |accessdate=2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monis attended Hizb ut-Tahrir rallies and was described by ''Sydney Morning Herald'' journalist Anne Davies as "a little unstable. He also seemed a little creepy. Ominously, he also told me he did not think giving speeches would be enough."&lt;ref name="annedavies"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sydney-siege-ends-a-reporters-encounter-with-man-haron-monis-20141216-12832j.html|title= Sydney siege ends: A reporter's encounter with Man Haron Monis|date= 16 December 2014|work= The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Seeking contact with ISIS====
In October 2014, Monis wrote a letter to [[George Brandis]]' office seeking advice on the legality of communicating with ISIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-28/sydney-siege-man-monis-letter-not-threatening-george-brandis/6502582|title= Sydney siege: A-G George Brandis asked why letter from Man Haron Monis did not trigger alarm bells|work= ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conversion to Sunni Islam====
Monis claimed to have converted from [[Shia Islam]] to [[Sunni Islam]].&lt;ref name= GuardianSafi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/12/what-we-know-about-the-sydney-hostage-taker.html Everything We Know Now About the Sydney Hostage-Taker], nymag.com; accessed 16 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; An announcement on his now-suspended website, posted a week before the Sydney siege, stated: "I used to be a [[Rafidi]], but not any more. Now I am a Muslim, [[Alhamdulillah|Alhamdu Lillah]]."&lt;ref name= Age-Monis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.channel4.com/news/who-is-sydney-gunman-man-haron-monis |title= Who was Sydney gunman Man Haron Monis? |work= [[Channel 4]] |date= 15 December 2014 |accessdate= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Rafidi]]", which means "one who rejects" in Arabic, "is typically used by Sunnis to denigrate Shias as non-Muslim."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/gunman-man-haron-monis-was-damaged-self-styled-muslim-cleric/story-fnqxbywy-1227157547335 |title= Gunman Man Haron Monis was ‘damaged’ self-styled Muslim cleric |work= [[The Australian]] |date= 15 December 2014 |last= Berkovic |first= Nicola |last2= Klan |first2= Anthony |publisher= News Limited |accessdate= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monis also used his website to pledge allegiance to [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], leader of the Islamic State whose 'main enemies' are the Shi'a.&lt;ref name= Mamouri/&gt;

On the day prior to taking a group of people hostage, Monis posted to his website:
{{blockquote|Islam is the religion of peace, that's why Muslims fight against the oppression and terrorism of USA and its allies including UK and Australia. If we stay silent towards the criminals we cannot have a peaceful society. The more you fight with crime, the more peaceful you are. Islam wants peace on the Earth, that's why Muslims want to stop terrorism of America and its allies. When you speak out against crime you have taken one step towards peace.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;}}

[[Australian Muslim]] commentators said that his [[religious conversion|conversion]] to Sunni Islam was less out of genuine religious conviction than designed to provide credibility in seeking an association with ISIL, as one "can't really claim to love IS when you're a Shiite and they're trying to exterminate you".&lt;ref name="Aly"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Aly |first1= Waleed |title= Sydney gunman Man Haron Monis a real sheikh only to himself |url= http://www.smh.com.au/comment/sydney-gunman-man-haron-monis-a-real-sheikh-only-to-himself-20141216-128h9x.html |work= The Sydney Morning Herald |date= 17 December 2014 |accessdate= 17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a long-time self-proclaimed [[sheikh]], albeit not recognised as such in the Islamic community.&lt;ref name= Age-Monis/&gt;&lt;ref name="abc-Monis"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Knowles|first1= Lorna |title= Sydney siege: Man behind siege named as Iranian cleric Man Haron Monis |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-16/cleric/5969246 |work= ABC News |date= 16 December 2014 |accessdate= 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was marginalised by [[Islam in Australia|Australian Muslim]] religious authorities and mosques for his extremist views and problematic personal and criminal history. It appears he came to espouse an [[Islamic extremism|extreme Islamist ideology]] on his own, and police and intelligence agencies have not identified any connections between Monis and international [[terrorist organisations]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sydney-hostages-police-raid-downtown-cafe/|title= Sydney hostage crisis ends; gunman dead after raid|date= 15 December 2014|publisher= |accessdate= 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 15 December 2014, Monis took hostage employees and customers at the [[Lindt &amp; Sprüngli|Lindt]] chocolate café in [[Martin Place, Sydney]], across from a [[Seven Network]] television studio. Hostages were made to hold up a [[Jihadist black flag|Black Standard]] with the ''[[shahada|shahādah]]'' (Islamic statement of faith) written in white Arabic text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/seven-evacuates-newsroom-near-cafe-siege/story-e6frfku9-1227156337550 |title= Seven in 'lockdown' due to hostage crisis |publisher= News Limited |work= news.com.au |accessdate= 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbouring buildings, including government offices and financial institutions, and [[Martin Place railway station]], were evacuated and locked down. Some hostages managed to escape. The event lasted over 16 hours when hostages made a run for the exit with Monis firing missing all hostages. Monis then took Tori Johnston (the cafe manager) at gunpoint forcing him to kneel before firing a fatal shot into Johnston's head. [[State Protection Group|Police tactical officers]] then decided to storm the café resulting in a shootout between Monis and police in the early hours of the following morning&lt;ref name="abc-blog"&gt;{{cite news |first1= Daniel |last1= Franklin |url= http://livenews.abc.net.au/Event/Live_blog_Siege_in_Sydneys_Martin_Place/137083674 |title= Live blog: Siege in Sydney's Martin Place |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work= ABC News |date= 15 December 2014 |accessdate= 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-30485355 |title= Sydney cafe siege: Australia police storm building |publisher= British Broadcasting Corporation |work= BBC News |date= 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Monis was confirmed by police to have died in the ensuing confrontation.&lt;ref name="abc-shot"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-16/sydney-siege-ends-martin-place-lindt-cafe/5969162 |title= Sydney siege: Two hostages and gunman dead after heavily armed police storm Lindt cafe in Martin Place |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work= ABC News |date= 16 December 2014 |quote= Two hostages and the gunman at the centre of a 16-hour siege at a cafe in Sydney's CBD have been shot dead, police have confirmed. |accessdate= 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the hostages also died, several others were wounded, and a police officer suffered minor injuries.&lt;ref name= abc-shot /&gt;&lt;ref name="police-release"&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/news/latest_releases?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGZWJpenByZC5wb2xpY2UubnN3Lmdvdi5hdSUyRm1lZGlhJTJGNDMxNDguaHRtbCZhbGw9MQ%3D%3D |title= Critical incident established following Martin Place siege |publisher= [[New South Wales Police Force]] |date= 16 December 2014 |location= Sydney |accessdate= 16 December 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20141215193054/http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/news/latest_releases?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGZWJpenByZC5wb2xpY2UubnN3Lmdvdi5hdSUyRm1lZGlhJTJGNDMxNDguaHRtbCZhbGw9MQ%3D%3D |archivedate= 15 December 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a website posting prior to the hostage incident, Monis denied all the charges against him, calling them politically motivated,&lt;ref name= BBCDamaged/&gt; accusing the Iranian [[Ministry of Intelligence]] and Australia's ASIO of framing him.&lt;ref name="tele-uk-named"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/11294514/Sydney-siege-gunman-named-as-Man-Haron-Monis.html |title= Sydney siege gunman named as Man Haron Monis |work= Telegraph.co.uk |date= 15 December 2014 |author= Jonathan Pearlman in Sydney |accessdate= 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No one claimed Monis's body when it was released by the [[NSW Coroner]], and he was subsequently buried in an undisclosed NSW location at state expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/martin-place-siege-gunman-man-horan-monis-buried-in-undisclosed-location-in-nsw/story-fni0cx12-1227191950482 |title=Martin Place siege gunman Man Horan Monis buried in undisclosed location in NSW |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=21 January 2015 |accessdate=2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Monis was listed under mentally disturbed individuals who have launched recent violent attacks justified with Islamist ideas or slogans. Other examples include the perpetrator of the 2016 [[Munich knife attack]] and Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the perpetrator of the [[2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa]]. According to psychologists and psychiatrists who study radicalisation, jihad propaganda and calls to kill the infidels can push mentally ill individuals to act, even in the absence of direct or personal contact with Islamists.&lt;ref name="AFDExploitMentally"&gt;{{cite news|title=Global terrorist groups exploit mentally ill people to carry out attacks|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/world/global-terrorist-groups-exploit-mentally-ill-people-to-carry-out-attacks-experts|accessdate=17 May 2016|agency=Agence France|publisher=Straits Times|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]] was briefed by the Australian Federal Police on 16 December 2014 that Monis had a gun licence, but the AFP later confirmed that Monis "was not a registered firearms licence holder".&lt;ref name="AFP gun licence"&gt;{{cite web |title= Media Statement: Firearm licence status of Man Haron Monis |url= http://www.afp.gov.au/media-centre/news/afp/2014/december/media-statement-firearm-licence-status-of-man-haron-monis.aspx |publisher= [[Australian Federal Police]] |date= 18 December 2014 |accessdate= 18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A joint review has been announced by the federal and state governments, to be helmed by [[Michael Thawley]] from the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]] and [[Blair Comley]] of the [[New South Wales Department of Premier and Cabinet]]. It will investigate the handling of the siege, and how Monis "slipped through state and federal security and legal nets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Grattan |first1= Michelle |authorlink= Michelle Grattan |title= Joint review ordered into siege and hostage-taker’s background |url= https://theconversation.com/joint-review-ordered-into-siege-and-hostage-takers-background-35619 |publisher= The Conversation |date= 17 December 2014 |accessdate= 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a call had been made to the national security hotline based on the contents of Monis' website, there were no threats of direct violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Safi |first1= Michael |title= Sydney siege: anonymous warning about Man Haron Monis followed up, says PM |url= https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/dec/21/sydney-siege-anonymous-warning-about-man-haron-monis-followed-up-says-pm |work= The Guardian |date= 21 December 2014 |accessdate= 22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

The Kochanski family immigrated to Canada from Poland in 1938 and Mors was born two years later (1940), the fifth of six children. His mother named him "Morris" but, because of a misunderstanding due to her Polish accent, the midwife wrote 'Mors' on the birth certificate. His father fought for the Polish Army, during the First World War. That experience left him with a strong desire to see his children educated, so that they might benefit from serving as officers. Mors' father felt that his children would inevitably be conscripted for military service, during a war in their lifetime.

Mors was brought up on a relatively isolated farm in Saskatchewan. He spent most of his time working the farm and assisting his father, who had been a windmill carpenter in Poland. In his early school years, he walked or rode 7 miles to and from school on a bush road. This daily journey was a significant part of his education and the foundation for a lifetime of interest in nature.

In 1954 his parents moved to Prince Albert and, freed from his farm chores, he made the public library his second home. Mors took particular interest in two books:

*An old Boy Scout manual - Mors lasted only one year as a Scout, due to disappointment in what he perceived as a lack of seriousness on the part of his fellow scouts and the Scout Master’s aversion to camp craft skills.

*[[The Ashley Book of Knots]] - Mors enlisted the help of the head Librarian, to order his own copy. At around $15 in 1952, it took him a long time to save enough money for purchase. So began a lifetime of collecting books on natural history, camping and survival skills, resulting in a personal library of thousands of titles.

Mors was a Sea Cadet for three years. He chose the Navy as a career and received a scholarship to the Canadian Services College, Royal Roads. While enrolled, he traveled by ship through the Panama Canal, in the summer of 1959. He was hospitalized for five weeks during his studies, predominantly due to a case of the mumps. This contributed to an honourable discharge in his second year, after failing too many subjects on the way to his Chemical Engineering degree.

From 1960 to 1964 he took Arts and Sciences at the University of Saskatchewan. Rather than enrolling in curriculum courses, Mors took classes that were of interest to him, including anthropology, psychology, geology and writing. His lack of participation in a recognised degree program resulted in a suspension from the university due to "a complete lack of direction", after four years.

==Professional career==

From that point on, he resolved to become a specialist in outdoor subjects, specialising in wilderness living skills and the lifestyles of wilderness peoples. However, Mors had many different jobs, before he found his opportunity to become an instructor. These include:

*Draughtsman - Updating the street plans of the City of Prince Albert after the installation of gas mains.

*Concrete Technician - Construction of water-excluding cribbing for a potash mine.

*Geologist Assistant - At an engineering firm, searching for an optimal location for a potash mine and exploring the feasibility of a solution mining approach in Saskatchewan.

*Engineering Technician - Involving a potash solution mine project.

*Surveyor - For the construction of roads in Saskatchewan.

*Social Worker

It was also around this time that he received a pilot’s license.

==Instructor career==

In 1968, Blue Lake Centre (near [[Hinton, Alberta|Hinton]], [[Alberta]]) began operating outdoor education programs. Mors, now 28 years of age, offered his services. At the same time, he met his friend and mentor, Tom Roycraft. At the time, Tom was the senior civilian survival instructor at a [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] survival school.

During the 1970s Mors became an associate professor at the University of Alberta Faculty of Physical Education, editor of the magazine ‘Alberta Wilderness Arts and Recreation’ and performed [[freelance]] work for various agencies.

In 1986, he was approached to write a book on survival and wilderness skills for the Canadian [[boreal forest]]s which was originally titled "Northern Bushcraft". The book became a Canadian bestseller. The original title 'Northern Bushcraft' was in reference to an earlier publication 'Bushcraft' by [[Richard Harry Graves]], which covered survival and wilderness living skills in the Australian environment. Eventually, the publishers later shortened the title to 'Bushcraft'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9146">'''Nehemiah Hiyya ben Moses Hayyun''' (ca. 1650 – ca. 1730) was a [[History of the Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] [[Kabalist]]. His parents, of [[Sephardic]] descent, lived in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] (then a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]), where probably he was born, although in later life he pretended that he was a [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] emissary born in [[Safed]]. He received his [[Talmudic]] education in [[Hebron]].

==Excommunicated at Jerusalem==
In his eighteenth year he became rabbi of [[Skopje|Uskup]] (The Ottoman Turkish spelling of the city's name during the period referred to in this article  is ''Üsküp'' - {{lang-ota|اسكوب}}). This position, however, he held only for a brief period. Thereafter he led a wandering life, as a merchant, as a scholar, or as a mendicant. In the guise of a saint he constantly sought adventures of love. From Uskup he went to Palestine, then to [[Egypt]]. In 1708 he made his appearance in [[Smyrna]], where he won some adherents willing to help him publish his ''Mehemnuta de Kulla,'' and thus secure a rabbinical position for him. In this work he asserted that [[Judaism]] teaches a Trinitarian God. This God, he declared, embodies three faces ("parẓufim") – the Ancient of Days ("'Attiḳ"), the Holy King, and the Shekinah. Ḥayyun's own part in this book consists only of two commentaries; the text was anonymously written by a [[Sabbatean]] pupil. Leaving Smyrna, Ḥayyun was led to [[Jerusalem]] with pomp and ceremony, but the rabbi of Smyrna, who had seen through his pretensions, warned the rabbis of Jerusalem of his heresies. The immediate consequence was that even before his arrival the rabbis of Jerusalem, though they had never read his work, excommunicated him as a "min," and condemned his book to be burned.

==At Prague==
Excommunicated, he met little sympathy anywhere (1709-1711) with his [[kabalistic]] fraud. In Venice, however (1711), with the approval of the rabbis of that community, he had printed an extract from his work, under the title ''Raza di-Yiḥudah,'' into the beginning of which he had woven the first stanza of a lascivious Italian love-song, ''La Bella Margaritha,'' with a mystical hymn entitled ''Keter 'Elyon.'' In [[Prague]], where he lived from 1711 until 1712, he found an appropriate soil for his teaching. Joseph Oppenheim, the son of [[David Oppenheim (rabbi)|David Oppenheim]], received him. The Kabbalistic rabbi of Prague, [[Naphtali Cohen]], was also greatly impressed with his personality. He even highly recommended his book, basing his judgment merely upon fraudulent testimonials. Here Ḥayyun delivered sermons which had a Shabbethaian background, and which he had printed in Berlin (1713) under the title ''Dibre Neḥemyah.'' Moreover, he played the role of a [[Magician (paranormal)|wizard]], of one who had intercourse with [[Elijah]], of a person capable of resurrecting the dead and of creating new worlds. By writing amulets he earned the money he needed for gambling. By fraudulent introductions he also managed to obtain friends in [[Vienna]], [[Mikulov|Nikolsburg]], [[Prostějov|Prossnitz]], [[Wrocław|Breslau]], [[Głogów|Glogau]], and [[Berlin]], and formed political connections with Löbel Prossnitz of [[Moravia]]. In Berlin (1713), the community of which city was then split into two parties, he succeeded in having his book ''Mehemnuta de Kulla,'' or ''Oz le-Elohim,'' printed with the approval of the Berlin rabbi, [[Aaron Benjamin Wolf]].

==In Amsterdam==
On the prestige he obtained from his book he now tried his fortune in [[Amsterdam]]. Almost from the outset he encountered the antagonism of [[Tzvi Ashkenazi]], rabbi of the German congregation of Amsterdam, who mistook him for another Ḥayyun, an old enemy of his. Ḥayyun surrendered his book to the board of the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Portuguese congregation]] in Amsterdam, in order to obtain permission to sell it. Distrusting their own rabbi, [[Solomon Ayllon]], this board brought the matter before [[Tzvi Ashkenazi]], who, of course, very soon detected its heretical character and called for its author's expulsion. At this point, however, Ayllon, under the threat of Hayyun to reveal his past life as a Shabbethaian to the whole of Amsterdam, became his defender, and made Ḥayyun's cause entirely his own and that of the Portuguese community. The result was that Ayllon was charged by the board of his synagogue to form a commission to reexamine Ḥayyun's book. Without awaiting the decision of this commission, Tzvi Ashkenazi and his anti-Shabbethaian friend [[Moses Hagiz]] excommunicated Ḥayyun (July 23, 1713). They published their decision, with various unjustified calumnies, in pamphlets, which, answered by counter pamphlets, greatly increased the ill feeling between the Portuguese and the German congregation.

==Left Amsterdam==
The Portuguese commission announced its decision on August 7, 1713. In spite of the objections of two members of the commission, one of them Ayllon's own son, they declared Ḥayyun entirely guiltless of heresy, and he was rehabilitated in a solemn assembly of the great Amsterdam synagogue. But Ḥayyun was excommunicated by many other outside congregations, and his disreputable antecedents and the deceptive means by which he acquired introductions were exposed, especially by [[Leon Brieli]], the aged rabbi of [[Mantua]]. In spite of this the members of the Portuguese commission adhered to their decision, but felt themselves bound to publicly exonerate themselves, and for this purpose issued ''Ḳoshṭ Imre Emet,'' a pamphlet which was not without obvious misstatements. Protected by the Portuguese, Ḥayyun could even insult his opponents in pamphlets, and did so. He attacked Ẓebi Ashkenazi, in ''Ha-Ẓad Ẓebi,'' Amsterdam, 1713; Joseph Ergas, in ''Shalhebet Yah'' and ''Ketobet Ḳa'ḳa''; Ẓebi Ashkenazi, Moses Ḥagiz, and Leon Brieli, in ''Pitḳa Min Shemaya''; Moses Ḥagiz, in ''Iggeret Shebuḳin,'' Amsterdam, 1714. At last, however, Ḥayyun left for the Orient, and every one felt relieved. The introductions given him by his supporters were of little avail; wherever he went the doors were barred against him.

In August 1724, through the influence of a vizier, he succeeded at [[Constantinople]] in absolving himself from the excommunication on the condition that he should abstain from teaching, writing, and preaching on cabalistic subjects. Under oath he promised this, but subsequently broke his word. Thus rehabilitated, he went to [[Vienna]] and managed, by urging his Trinitarian teachings and professing his intention to convert the Jews to [[Christianity]], to obtain a letter of protection from the [[Austrian monarchy|Austrian]] emperor, although he secretly sympathized with the [[Shabbethaians]] and still openly professed to be an [[Orthodox Jew]]. But his game had been played. Before the walls of Prague he faced starvation. In Berlin, he threatened to profess Christianity if support were denied him. His friends in Amsterdam, even Ayllon, thus forsook him. In April 1726, he was excommunicated in [[Hamburg]] and finally in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]. He fled to [[North Africa]], where he died. His son turned Christian, and endeavored to revenge his father by allegedly-calumnious attacks on Judaism.

'''Robert Hendy-Freegard''' IBPM 2 (born '''Anas Tarhi''', 1 March 1971) is a Moroccan [[barman]], car salesman, [[confidence trick|conman]] and [[impostor]] who masqueraded as an [[MI5]] agent and fooled several people to go underground for fear of [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] [[assassination]]. He was born in [[Hodthorpe]], a small [[village]] near [[Whitwell, Derbyshire|Whitwell]], in [[Derbyshire]].

==Methods==
Hendy-Freegard met his victims on social occasions or as customers in the pub or car dealership where he was working. He would reveal his "role" as an [[undercover agent]] for [[MI5]], [[Special Branch]] or [[Scotland Yard]] working against the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]. He would win them over, ask for money and make them do his bidding. He demanded that they cut off contact with family and friends, go through "loyalty tests" and live alone in poor conditions. He seduced five women, claiming that he wanted to marry them. Initially some of the victims refused to cooperate with the police because he had warned them that police would be [[double agent]]s or MI5 agents performing another "loyalty test".

A television documentary called "The Spy who stole my Life" was shown by [[Five (channel)|Channel Five]] on 7 September 2005. In Australia, this was called "The spy who conned me".

==First victims==

In 1992 Robert Freegard was working in ''The Swan'', a pub in [[Newport, Shropshire]] and befriended two women and one man, three agriculture students of the Harper Adams Agricultural College in [[Edgmond, Shropshire|Edgmond]].

First, he told the man that he was an MI5 undercover agent who was investigating an IRA cell in the college. He forced the man to let himself be beaten up to prove his loyalty and to show that he was “hard enough”. He also convinced him to behave in a bizarre manner in college to prove his loyalty and to alienate him from friends. Then Hendy-Freegard told him his cover was blown and both of them had to go undercover. He told the women that the man had cancer and convinced them to accompany them in a “farewell tour” all over England.

Later he let them in on “the story”. He told them to sever all contact with their families because they were in danger just through being associated with him. They moved to [[Sheffield]] and gave him all their money. The three spent five months in a Sheffield flat because Hendy-Freegard had forbidden them to go out.

The group eventually split up, others took jobs — still handing most of their money to Hendy-Freegard — and one of the women became his lover. She gave birth to his two daughters. When she eventually found out about his other affairs and confronted him, he beat her up and threatened to kill her before he told her that she could not talk to anyone for “security reasons”.

Hendy-Freegard convinced the man and his parents to give him £300,000. He was put into “training”, performing spurious jobs. Sometimes he would have to wait for days in a certain place for a non-existent meeting. Eventually, he told his sister that the IRA was pursuing him, and the tale began to unravel.

==Other seductions==

Hendy-Freegard also seduced a newly married personal assistant who was taking care of his children. He told her he was with MI5 and forced her to cut contact with friends and family lest the IRA would kill her. He also took naked pictures of her and threatened to give them to her husband if she would not cooperate. She had to change her name and tell the [[deed poll]] officer it was because she was sexually abused as a child. Her loyalty tests included sleeping in [[Heathrow]] airport and on park benches for several nights and pretending to be a [[Jehovah's Witness]] so that his bosses in MI5 would let them marry. She was told she was under constant surveillance and once that a [[sniper]] was watching their home. He told her to take up loans, supposedly to settle her debts.

In 2000 Hendy-Freegard met a lawyer, a customer in the car dealership in [[Chiswick]], West London. He helped her to change her car, pocketed the difference, asked for more, persuaded her to give more money for a leasing business they would run together and stole £14,000 from her [[building society]] account. They became lovers and went on holidays all over the world. They then became engaged but her family intervened. When the leasing car did not materialize, he told her that the Polish Mafia had taken it.

In 2002 Hendy-Freegard seduced an American child psychologist with tales of how he had infiltrated a criminal network and how he had killed a criminal who had threatened to expose him. He said he wanted to marry her, on condition that she would also become an agent and cut off the contact with her family. He instigated loyalty tests and a change of identity. He urged her to kill her son and told her that he had taken a contract out for the murder of both of them. He told her that they would move to a [[lighthouse]] and when she refused to live there, he wanted £80,000 to repay the state because the arrangements had already been made. She got the money from her father as payment for "spy school". At one stage she spent three weeks "hiding" in a bathroom, locked in there by Freegard.

==Other victims==

Hendy-Freegard convinced a [[Sheffield]] jeweller to give the mother of his children a room for a time and later tried to recruit him into the "organization". Hendy-Freegard also sent him to perform spurious missions as "training" - like sending him to London with strict instructions of what transportation to use, to buy a can opener in a certain shop and hand it over to a certain man in a certain pub. When the victim's "controller" seemed excessively amused when told about his trip, he grew suspicious and demanded to see his boss. There was no one in the meeting.

Hendy-Freegard convinced a female company director that he was watching someone in the Sheffield car dealership where he was working and convinced her to buy a better car. He sold her original car on his own account, kept the money and convinced her to take a £15,000 loan for him. He also again asked for a room for the mother of his children because she was supposedly in a [[witness protection program]] and told her that she was Spanish, so that the two women would not speak to each other.

Hendy-Freegard told a woman in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] that he needed money to buy off IRA killers, who had been released after the [[Good Friday agreement]]. She gave him £16,000 over six years. He also sold her car and again kept the money.

==Arrest and trial==

In 2002 Scotland Yard and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] organized a [[sting operation]]. First, the FBI bugged the phone of the American psychologist's parents. Her mother told Hendy-Freegard she would hand over £10,000 but only in person. Hendy-Freegard met the mother in Heathrow airport where police apprehended him. He denied all charges and claimed they were part of a conspiracy against him and continued this story in the subsequent trial.

On 23 June 2005, after an eight-month trial, [[Blackfriars Crown Court]] convicted Robert Hendy-Freegard for two counts of [[kidnapping]], 10 of [[theft]] and 8 of [[Deception (criminal law)|deception]]. On  6 September 2005 he was given a [[life sentence]]. Police doubt that they have discovered all the victims and no criminally sexual offences from at least one of the 'victims' (testimony from victim E.Richardson due to numerous 'abnormal' rape offences) were taken into account.

On 25 April 2007, the BBC reported that Robert Hendy-Freegard had appealed against his kidnapping convictions and won.  His life sentence was revoked but still served nine years for the other offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='MI5' conman wins sentence appeal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/nottinghamshire/6591627.stm|work=BBC|date=25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) judgment played an important role in defining the modern offence of kidnap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2007/1236.html R. v. Hendy-Freegard  &amp;#91;2007&amp;#93; EWCA Crim 1236]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1363">'''Samfundet SHT''' ([[English language|English]] translation: "SHT Society") is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[fraternal order]] founded in 1844 in Uppsala. It is dedicated to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] god [[Bacchus]], the [[fine arts]] and mutual enjoyment.

== History ==

Originally a [[student fraternity]], it gradually transformed during the second half of the 19th century and came to encompass mainly older academics and university educated professionals. Around the beginning of the 20th century, members of SHT held a majority of the seats in the [[Swedish academy]] and the board of directors of [[Uppsala University]]. This dominant position within Sweden's arts and sciences was to a large extent lost during the 20th century, due to social changes and university reforms which came to dilute the influence previously held by the academical elite of [[Uppsala]] and [[Lund]]. This did however not slow the growth of the society.

== Organisation ==

Today, SHT has lodges or other suborganisations in 27 Swedish cities and a small chapter in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Frängsmyr &amp; Tom Lundin: ''SHT:s Stor-Mästare'' (Uppsala, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Born in Chicago in 1930, at the age of six, Skolnick was paralyzed by [[polio]], and he used a [[wheelchair]] for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Trib&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-05-23/news/0605230116_1_conspiracy-sherman-skolnick-harold-washington |newspaper= [[Chicago Tribune]] |title= Sherman Skolnick |date= May 23, 2006 |last= Noel |first= Josh |accessdate= March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, a homemaker and a tailor, were Jewish European immigrants.&lt;ref name=Trib/&gt; Skolnick's father was from Russia.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901306,00.html |title= Judges: Skolnick's Guerrilla War |date= August 29, 1969 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Skolnick was founder and chairman of the '''Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts''',&lt;ref name=Trib/&gt; which he started in 1963. He used the local press to distribute his reports, later establishing a telephone hotline–"Hotline News", a [[public-access television]] show on [[cable TV]], and a web site.&lt;ref name=Trib/&gt;

Skolnick's investigations put [[Otto Kerner, Jr.|Otto Kerner Jr.]] in prison for three years; and led to the resignation of two [[Illinois Supreme Court]] justices, [[Roy Solfisburg|Roy J. Solfisburg, Jr.]] and [[Ray Klingbiel]], who, as Skolnick reported, had accepted bribes of stock from a defendant in a case on which they ruled.&lt;ref name=Trib/&gt; The scandal catapulted [[John Paul Stevens]], special counsel to an investigating commission, to fame as a justice of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=Review&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/old-indices/vol10is3/patten.pdf |journal= [[Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture]] |title= Review of ''Illinois Justice: The Scandal of 1969 and the Rise of John Paul Stevens'' |last= Patten |first= Joseph N. |year= 2003–2004 |volume= 10 |issue= 3 |pages= 233–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the story became the subject of a book, ''Illinois Justice'', by Kenneth A. Manaster.&lt;ref name=Review/&gt;

Skolnick's final written works include an 81-part series entitled "The Overthrow of the American Republic," and a 16-part series entitled "[[Coca-Cola]], the [[CIA]], and the Courts."&lt;ref name=Trib/&gt; Skolnick wrote for Willis Carto's Spotlight, a Holocaust denying publication. &lt;ref&gt; http://rense.com/general11/tim.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29502">'''Silviu Brucan''' (born '''Saul Bruckner'''; 18 January 1916 &amp;ndash; 14 September 2006) was a Romanian Communist politician. Though he disagreed with [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s policies, he never gave up his Communist beliefs and did not oppose Communist ideology. After the [[Romanian Revolution]], Brucan became a political analyst and author of books on Communism and [[Eastern Europe]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Bucharest]] to wealthy [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] parents living in Berzei Street, near [[Hala Matache Măcelaru|Matache Măcelaru Market]].&lt;ref name="Brucan7"&gt;Brucan, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a wholesale wool merchant who imported fabrics from England in the aftermath of World War I, suits of fine English fabrics being a [[Luxury goods|luxury]] item that was popular among the Romanian bourgeoisie that was rising by the economic boom.&lt;ref name="Brucan7"/&gt; He attended the [[German-language]] ''Evangelische Schule'' of Luterană Street and the [[Saint Sava National College]].&lt;ref name="gardianul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.gardianul.ro/2006/09/16/linia_fierbinte-c5/politologul_silviu_brucan_a_decedat_la_v_rsta_de_90_de_ani-s84370.html "Politologul Silviu Brucan a decedat la vârsta de 90 de ani" ("The Political Scientist Silviu Brucan Has Died at the Age of 90")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214075429/http://www.gardianul.ro/2006/09/16/linia_fierbinte-c5/politologul_silviu_brucan_a_decedat_la_v_rsta_de_90_de_ani-s84370.html |date=2008-02-14 }}, in ''[[Gardianul]]'', September 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 came the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street Crash]], leading to the [[Great Depression]] and a slump in the luxury industry, including English clothes and Brucan's father's shop in Şepcari Street went bankrupt and the Brucan family was left penniless.&lt;ref name="Brucan8"&gt;Brucan, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AP, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/16/world/europe/16brucan.html "Silviu Brucan, 90, Opponent of Ceausescu, Dies"], ''New York Times'', September 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; They moved into a modest apartment on Vlad Ţepeș Street. Brucan's father found a job as a fabric expert working for a German merchant, but as that was not enough to feed a family of six, Silviu Brucan began giving private lessons to pupils of wealthy families, thus gaining access to the world of the rich landowners and industrialists.&lt;ref name="Brucan9"&gt;Brucan, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; In his memories, Brucan said that the sharp contrast between the world of luxury of the privileged classes and the misery of those who worked hard all day to earn a living and the feeling of [[social injustice]] strongly influenced him.&lt;ref name="Brucan9"/&gt;

As a social outcast (his father had been indicted for [[fraudulent bankruptcy]]) and as a Jew in the 1930s, he was prevented by the [[Iron Guard]] supporters from formally studying at the [[University of Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="Brucan11"&gt;Brucan, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, with the help of some friends, he attended some courses at the university, such as the lectures of historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], the philosopher [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], the aesthetician [[Tudor Vianu]] and the philosopher [[Nae Ionescu]].&lt;ref name="Brucan12"&gt;Brucan, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early activism==
Brucan joined the left-wing movement at the age of 18. He was attracted by the opinions found leftist and antifascist weekly newspapers such as ''[[Stînga]]'' (The Left), ''[[Era Nouă]]'' (New Era) and ''[[Cuvîntul Liber]]'' (Free Word).&lt;ref name="Brucan11"/&gt; Brucan joined communist groups, which organized "cultural evenings" at the houses of some supporter. There, he met literate communist supporters such as [[Alexandru Sahia]]. He began reading Marxist literature and soon was co-opted into party operations, being asked t hide some illegal party documents (speeches at a [[Comintern]] meeting in Prague) at his home.&lt;ref name="Brucan13"&gt;Brucan, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the moderate left-wing ''[[Dimineaţa]]'' newspaper competed against ''[[Universul]]'', a nationalist right-wing newspaper. To eliminate his rival, the owner of ''Universul'', [[Stelian Popescu]], began an anti-Semitic campaign (the owners of ''Dimineaţa'' were Jews) leading to fascists burning copies of the newspaper and associated posters. The communist and socialist youth organized [[vigilante]] groups to defend the newsstands. Brucan was part of one of the left-wing groups defending the newsstands of [[Gara de Nord]] and was involved in a fight with Iron Guar supporters, sustaining a severe [[head injury]].&lt;ref name="Brucan12"/&gt;

He subsequently worked as a journalist, first writing a fashionable social column at ''[[Gazeta de seară]]'', then working as a [[proofreader]] at ''[[Adevărul|Adevărul Literar]]''&lt;ref name="Brucan13"/&gt; Brucan met [[Aurel Alicu]], a leader of the National Peasant Youth, with whom he started in 1937 a weekly called ''[[Dacia Nouă]]'', having writers from both the traditional parties (National Liberal and National Peasants Party) and from left-wing circles ([[Miron Constantinescu]], [[Corneliu Mănescu]], [[Roman Moldovan]] and [[Victor Iliu]]). The newspaper was published for a year until the [[Octavian Goga]] government shut it down.&lt;ref name="Brucan14"&gt;Brucan, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1938, he was conscripted, serving at a [[border guard]] unit at the frontier with Bulgaria, where he was acquainted with both [[komitadji]] extremists who attacked Romanian outposts, the [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] colonists in [[Southern Dobruja]] and the Middle Eastern smugglers who illegally crossed the border with [[hashish]] or [[opium]].&lt;ref&gt;Brucan, p.14-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koliopoulos, Giannēs. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3hFahiZflJoC&amp;pg=PA69 Plundered Loyalties: Axis Occupation and Civil Strife in Greek West Macedonia, 1941–1949]'', C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, 1999, {{ISBN|185065381X}}. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Brucan lived in the attic of a house in a quiet area in [[Cotroceni]], working as an illegal press worker for the Communist Party's newspaper ''Scînteia''.&lt;ref&gt;Brucan, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, he was arrested by a police agent who accidentally noticed him on Buzești Street, recalling his face from a photograph of a fellow Communist who had been previously arrested. However, as the police could not find any incriminating evidence, he was released a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;Brucan, p.31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the 23 August 1944 coup==
In September 1944, upon Romania's exit from the [[Axis Powers|Axis camp]] and the onset of [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]], he was named the general secretary of ''[[Scînteia]]'' (the deputy editor in chief to [[Leonte Răutu]]), the official newspaper of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="gardianul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cotidianul_5feb"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=3921&amp;art=8954&amp;cHash=89bad959e1 Mirona Hriţcu, "Silviu Brucan e gata să-şi îngroape profeţia" ("Silviu Brucan Is About to Outlive His Prophecy")], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', February 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, ''Stalinism pentru eternitate'', p.212, 304, 309&lt;/ref&gt;

As long as the other newspapers still were published, ''Scînteia'' competed with them for the readers and Brucan, with the rest of the editors, tried to make a professional newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Brucan, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; However, as party newspapers and independent newspapers were forcefully closed, one by one, by the new communist authorities, the ''Scînteia'' journalists became office clerks working 9 to 5 and writing ideological editorials for the indoctrination of the workers, who were "full of hope for a glorious future".&lt;ref&gt;Brucan, p.35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

As editor of ''Scînteia'', he supported the prison sentences of [[Iuliu Maniu]], [[Gheorghe I. Brătianu]] and [[Corneliu Coposu]] (''see [[Tămădău Affair]]'').&lt;ref name="evz_5feb"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.evz.ro/article.php?artid=79214 Ondine Gherguţ, "Brucan, condamnat în procesul cu Vasile Lupu" ("Brucan, Sentenced in His Trial with Vasile Lupu")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013165259/http://www.evz.ro/article.php?artid=79214 |date=2007-10-13 }} in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', February 15, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported the repression of [[anticommunist]] journalists, such as [[Radu Gyr]] and [[Pamfil Şeicaru]], asking for the [[death penalty]] for the latter.&lt;ref name="evz_5feb"/&gt;

During this period, Brucan's wife, the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[Alexandra Sidorovici]] (with whom he had three children: daughter Anca,  and sons Dinu and Vlad), became a public prosecutor of the [[Romanian People's Tribunals]], which allowed her to ask for death sentences for many [[war criminal]]s; the sister of [[Teofil Sidorovici]],&lt;ref name="dubioasaconv"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=3100&amp;nr=2006-09-29 "Dubioasa convertire a lui Silviu Brucan" ("Silviu Brucan's Dubious Conversion")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309004430/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=3100&amp;nr=2006-09-29 |date=2007-03-09 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', September–October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; she was a member of the ''[[nomenklatura]]'' of the [[Communist Romania|Communist government]].&lt;ref name="evz_5feb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frunză"&gt;Victor Frunză, ''Istoria stalinismului în România'' ("The History of Stalinism in Romania"), [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1990, p.227, 302, 471&lt;/ref&gt;

For a short while (1948–1949), Brucan was Professor of Journalism at the [[University of Bucharest]] although he never graduated from college.&lt;ref name="gardianul"/&gt;

A close collaborator of Communist leader [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]],&lt;ref name="gardianul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dubioasaconv"/&gt; Brucan, along with [[Sorin Toma]] and [[Mihail Roller]], was among the prominent party ideologues of the group that was co-ordinated by Leonte Răutu after the late 1940s and into the 1950s.&lt;ref name="dubioasaconv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, ''Stalinism pentru eternitate'', p.212, 304&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambassador to the United States==
A loyal Soviet agent, Brucan was [[ambassador]] of Romania to the [[United States]] in 1955. He used the experience as the basis of a book that he co-authored with Sidorovici (a virulent attack on American institutions),&lt;ref name="dubioasaconv"/&gt; He was ambassador to the [[United Nations]] between 1959 and 1962 as well as the head of [[Televiziunea Română]].&lt;ref name="cotidianul_5feb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, ''Stalinism pentru eternitate'', p.263, 309&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict with Ceauşescu==
Progressively from the 1960s, Brucan became an opponent of the new leadership around Ceauşescu. Initially, upon news that Ceauşescu had been appointed [[general secretary]], he considered renouncing his political career to focus on an office at the university, but he was persuaded by [[Emil Bodnăraş]] to remain an activist.&lt;ref name="cotidianul_5feb"/&gt; He was a professor of [[Scientific Socialism]] at the Bucharest [[Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy|Faculty of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="evz_5feb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, ''Stalinism pentru eternitate'', p.309-310&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brucan himself, he faced a period of financial insecurity and began work as a translator to cover his expenses.&lt;ref name="cotidianul_5feb"/&gt; He also sent several works, subject to [[censorship]] at home, to be published in the United States. They showed his move towards [[reformism]] that he advocated to be applied inside the [[Eastern bloc]].&lt;ref name="Tismăneanu, p.310"&gt;Tismăneanu, ''Stalinism pentru eternitate'', p.310&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, after sending an anti-Ceauşescu declaration to the foreign press (to the [[BBC]], the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', and [[United Press International]]), a relatively 
-mild criticism for the violent repression of the [[Braşov Rebellion]],&lt;ref name="gardianul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dubioasaconv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frunză"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.487&lt;/ref&gt; he was sentenced to [[house arrest]]. At the time, Brucan had won the approval of Soviet authorities, which had already engaged in ''[[Perestroika]]'' policies and had been extended informal protection by the Soviet embassy in Bucharest, allowing him a relevant degree of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.487; Neumann, p.183&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help from [[Iulian Vlad]], the chief of the [[Securitate]], he was issued a [[passport]], and in 1988, despite being expelled from the party,&lt;ref name="gardianul"/&gt; he spent six months in the United States, where he was in contact with the [[United States Department of State]],&lt;ref name="cotidianul_5feb"/&gt; headed by [[George P. Shultz]]. Brucan also claimed to have been invited to [[Moscow]] by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] politicians [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Anatoly Dobrynin]],&lt;ref name="gardianul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cotidianul_5feb"/&gt; who endorsed criticism of Ceauşescu and a Romanian version of ''[[Glasnost]]''.&lt;ref name="dubioasaconv"/&gt; Based on the personal testimonies of Gorbachev's adviser, scholar [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]] has disputed all of Brucan's account.&lt;ref name="dubioasaconv"/&gt;

The fact that Ceaușescu allowed Brucan [[freedom of movement]] shows that Ceaușescu was not subjecting him to the same restrictions as to common dissidents, especially because of the interest about the safety of Brucan by both the Soviet Union (by making sure that the ''[[Pravda]]'' correspondent in Bucharest would keep close contact with him) and the governments of Britain and the United States by inviting him as a special guest in their countries.&lt;ref name="Deletant278"&gt;Deletant, p.278&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Letter of the Six''==
{{main|Letter of the Six}}
In March 1989, together with five other Communist dignitaries ([[Gheorghe Apostol]], [[Alexandru Bârlădeanu]], [[Grigore Răceanu]], [[Corneliu Mănescu]] and [[Constantin Pîrvulescu]]), he signed the [[open letter]] known as ''Scrisoarea celor şase''("The Letter of the Six").&lt;ref name="gardianul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cotidianul_5feb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dubioasaconv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tanasescu"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.itcnet.ro/history/archive/mi1998/current1/mi40.htm D.

Unfettered Lockers")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325025150/http://www.itcnet.ro/history/archive/mi1998/current1/mi40.htm |date=2009-03-25 }}, in ''Magazin Istoric'', no. 40, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.487; Neumann, p.180; Tismăneanu, ''Stalinism pentru eternitate'', p.262-263, 310&lt;/ref&gt;

The document, which was immediately broadcast on [[Radio Free Europe]] and [[Voice of America]], was a [[left-wing]] critique of Ceauşescu's policies,&lt;ref name="dubioasaconv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, p.180; Tismăneanu, ''Stalinism pentru eternitate'', p.262-263&lt;/ref&gt; and it led to the swift arrest and interrogation of the signatories by the Securitate and then to their [[internal exile]] and [[house arrest]] at various locations.&lt;ref name="gardianul"/&gt; The Securitate depicted Brucan as one of several "hostile, inveterate, elements" and "the agent of foreign [[imperialism|imperialist]] secret services".&lt;ref name="tanasescu"/&gt; Although lacking in actual popular support,&lt;ref name="Tismăneanu, p.263"&gt;Tismăneanu, ''Stalinism pentru eternitate'', p.263&lt;/ref&gt; the letter was argued to be the among most important and influential acts of opposition and a notorious break with the traditions of strict obedience and party discipline.&lt;ref name="Tismăneanu, p.263"/&gt;

Brucan was sent to a location on the outskirts of Bucharest, in [[Dămăroaia]],&lt;ref name="gardianul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deletant278"/&gt; the reason for his subsequent colloquial [[moniker]], "The [[Oracle]] of Dămăroaia".&lt;ref name="evz_5feb"/&gt; Despite increased pressure, most of the contributors to the protest refused to withdraw their statement.&lt;ref name="Tismăneanu, p.263"/&gt; Brucan later accused Apostol of having given in to pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, ''Stalinism pentru eternitate'', p.292&lt;/ref&gt;

==During and after the Revolution==
Brucan was part of the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN) during the [[Romanian Revolution]], joining its Provisional Council and its Executive Committee. As a member of the Council, he was also involved in selecting Roman for the office of [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Premier]].&lt;ref name="dubioasaconv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="upheaval"/&gt;

He was a member of the Council (together with [[Ion Iliescu]], [[Petre Roman]] and some generals, including [[Nicolae Militaru]]) who decided to put the Ceaușescu couple on trial at the site in which they were being held in [[Târgoviște]]. That was due to the fear that Securitate snipers might attack the barracks and free them.&lt;ref name="Deletant371"&gt;Deletant, p.371&lt;/ref&gt; According to the testimony of [[Petre Roman]], Brucan was among those who insisted for Nicolae and [[Elena Ceauşescu]] to be executed immediately after the trial,&lt;ref name="cotidianul_5feb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deletant371"/&gt; a claim that was denied by Brucan.&lt;ref name="Deletant371"/&gt;

When it was decided that the 10-point programme be read on national television on 22 December, according to [[Dumitru Mazilu]], Brucan wanted it to include a clause that Romania would honour its obligations under the Soviet-controlled [[Warsaw Pact]].&lt;ref name="upheaval"/&gt;

In early January, Brucan made an assurance that the FSN had no intention of turning into a political party but would support some candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DB163DF931A35752C0A966958260 Upheaval in the East: Bucharest; New ruling group in Rumania to vie in April elections], ''New York Times'', January 2, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; However, only three weeks later, he supported the transformation of the FSN into a political party,&lt;ref name="dubioasaconv"/&gt; arguing that otherwise, there would be a "political vacuum" that the new political parties would be unable to fill.&lt;ref name="frontfight"&gt;"Romania's Front to fight elections", ''Guardian'', January 24, 1990, Page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

After public allegations, Brucan resigned from the FSN in February 1990, claiming that he had accomplished his mission to restore stability in Romania and to put the country on a course toward multi-party elections.&lt;ref name="upheaval"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D9163CF936A35751C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "Upheaval in the East: Romania; A Veteran Leader Resigns in Bucharest"], ''New York Times'', February 5, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; His prediction that the FSN would win the elections by more than 90%, supported the already-wide suspicions of falsified ballots.

Early that year, he bad been the host of investor [[George Soros]] at the [[Group for Social Dialogue]], a Romanian [[NGO]] that had been formed around the intellectual élite of the previous regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silviu Brucan and George Soros (1990)|title=Silviu Brucan, gazda lui George Soros la GDS|url=http://www.napocanews.ro/2016/08/silviu-brucan-gazda-lui-george-soros-la-gds-grupul-pentru-dialog-social-in-ianuarie-1990-foto-documente-de-emanuel-parvu.html|website=napocanews.ro|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He did not wish to run in the 1990 elections&lt;ref name="frontfight"/&gt; but to be "just the adviser" of now-President Iliescu.&lt;ref name="notagainst"/&gt; Nevertheless, he later issued a vocal criticism of [[President of Romania|President]] Iliescu.&lt;ref name="gardianul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cotidianul_5feb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tismăneanu, p.310"/&gt;

In 1990, Brucan contended that Romanians would need 20 years to become accustomed to democracy. That claim became well known in Romania.&lt;ref name="gardianul"/&gt;

On the eve of the day of the first free post-communist elections (20 May 1990), Brucan argued that the 1989 Revolution was not anticommunist but only against Ceauşescu, not the communism of the 1950s and 1960s. He said that Iliescu made a "monumental" mistake in "conceding to the crowd" and banning the Romanian Communist Party.&lt;ref name="notagainst"&gt;"Romania revolution 'not against communism'", ''Guardian'', May 19, 1990, Page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

As a supporter of Soviet revival and expansion, he was an important contributor in defining [[Eurasianism]] as a geopolitical concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brucan|first1=Silviu|title=Geopolitics and Strategy|url=http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/pdf-1/Sfera_14.pdf|website=sferapoliticii.ro|publisher=Sfera Politicii|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
From the late 1990s, Brucan hosted a news commentary program on the [[ProTV]] network (''Profeţii despre trecut'' - "Foretellings on the Past"), initially together with [[Lucian Mândruţă]]. During his final years, he was also a columnist for ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]''.

In 1998, he was brought to court by [[Vasile Lupu (Romanian politician)|Vasile Lupu]], a leader of the [[Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party (Romania)|Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party]] (PNŢCD) and a [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|deputy]] for [[Iaşi County]].&lt;ref name="evz_5feb"/&gt; Speaking on his show, Brucan had called Lupu "astute to the square" and "trained Securitate [[informant]]" and indicated that "any good-faithed National Peasantist who still views himself as a party colleague with Vasile Lupu is self-excluding himself from the PNŢCD".&lt;ref name="evz_5feb"/&gt; In 2002, courts decided in Lupu's favour, and Brucan was found guilty of [[slander and libel|calumny]]. Brucan was required to pay Lupu the sum of 30 million [[Romanian leu|lei]] as compensation.&lt;ref name="evz_5feb"/&gt;

At the age of 90, Brucan underwent a seven-hour stomach operation on 4 September 2006.&lt;ref name="gardianul"/&gt; Despite an initial good recovery from surgery, his condition suddenly worsened on 13 September, and he died the following day of [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref name="gardianul"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Writing in 2006, [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]] criticized Brucan, arguing that, despite his renunciation of Communism, Brucan had continued to support [[authoritarianism]] in public life and to display a taste for intrigue, and that he had attempted to transform the FSN into a "big party", virtually replacing the PCR.&lt;ref name="dubioasaconv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, ''Stalinism pentru eternitate'', p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Tismăneanu pointed out Brucan's post-1990 opposition to  [[Mircea Răceanu]], who had been imprisoned on dubious  [[espionage]] charges under Ceauşescu, and who was later [[Political rehabilitation|rehabilitated]] by Romanian courts.&lt;ref name="dubioasaconv"/&gt; He has also contended that memoirs authored by Brucan showed little remorse, if not at all, for his early involvement in support of political repression.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, ''Stalinism pentru eternitate'', p.46, 52&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Victor Neumann]], Brucan's role in the Bucharest episode of the 1989 Revolution had apparently helped indirectly the original and virtually unrelated revolt in [[Timişoara]], especially by preventing a more violent repression against it, but it was never explained.&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, p.180&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that Brucan's group of former inner-Party dissidents was, in the eyes of the uninformed public at large, the only "credible alternative" at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, p.184-185, 189&lt;/ref&gt; and cited Brucan's own statement: "The train had arrived in the station and we were the only ones who could get on it. What were we to say, that we will not get on? We did it".&lt;ref&gt;Brucan, in Neumann, p.185&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Neumann contended, Silviu Brucan's political and diplomatic expertise, as well as his adaptability, had made this old Stalinist the "ideologist of political transformations in 1989 Romania",&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, p.189&lt;/ref&gt; and had contributed to the supremacy of left-wing discourse in the years following the Revolution&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, p.183, 189&lt;/ref&gt; (in regard to the latter point, he cited Brucan arguments, which challenged the existence of the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] themes in the ideological makeup of the 1989 movement).&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, p.183&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5299">'''Smohalla''' (Dreamer) (c. 1815 - 1895) ''[[Wanapum]]'' nineteenth-century dreamer-prophet associated with the [[Dreamers movement]] among [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people in the [[Pacific Northwest]]’s [[Columbia River Plateau|Columbia Plateau]] region.

==Biography==
Born between 1815 and 1820 in the [[Wallula]] area of present-day [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]], Smohalla belonged to the [[Shahaptian]] Wanapum (also ''Wanapam''; called ''Sokulk'' by [[Lewis and Clark]]) tribal group. At birth he was called ''Wak-wei'' or ''Kuk-kia'', meaning “arising from the dust of earth mother.” After achieving prominence as a spiritual leader, he became known as ''Smohalla'' (or ''Smo-halla'', ''Shmoqula'', ''Smuxale'', ''Smowalla'', {{IPA-sal|ˈʃmuχala|IPA}}), also defined as “preacher.” Still other names associated with him include ''Yuyunipitqana'', “the shouting mountain” and ''Waipshwa'', “Rock carrier.” &lt;ref&gt;"Smohalla, the Washani, and Religion as a Factor in Northwestern Indian History." Clifford E. Trafzer and Margery Ann Beach. ''American Indian Quarterly'', Vol. 9, No. 3, American Indian Prophets: Religious Leaders and Revitalization Movements (Summer, 1985), pp. 309-324.&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Following political conflicts with the [[Walla Walla (tribe)|Walla Walla]] chief Homily ([[Homli]]), Smohalla and his followers moved to the more isolated area of P’na Village at the foot of [[Priest Rapids]] in present day [[Yakima County]], Washington. Already distinguished as a warrior, Smohalla began to preach his revitalization doctrine, which emphasized a return to tribal traditions and beliefs around about 1850. The rapid spread of his teachings is said to have contributed to the confederation of tribes in the region against white expansionism in the [[Yakima War]] of 1855–1856. Precipitated by government plans to confine Native people to small reservations, the war was fought by a coalition of Indians opposed to the assault on their land base and traditional cultures.  Shortly after the war, Smohalla is said to have fought with [[Chief Moses|Moses]], a [[Sinkiuse-Columbia]] chief, and was nearly killed. Presumed dead, he revived enough to escape by boat.

It is said that he then set forth on a journey. According to this account, he traveled as far south as Mexico, returning by way of Arizona, Utah and Nevada where he is said to observed [[Mormon]] priests "receiving commands directly from heaven". When he reached home, he reported to the people that he had been to the spirit world.&lt;ref&gt;''Dreamer-Prophets of the Columbia Plateau: Smohalla and Skolaskin''.Ruby, Robert H., and John A. Brown. Norman: [[University of Oklahoma Press]], 1989, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this version was discounted by [[Wanapum]] elders and descendants of Smohalla, who argued instead that his communication with the spirits is said to have occurred while he was mourning the loss of a beloved child.

Already known as a medicine man, the teachings he acquired at this time established him as a prophet. Smohalla exhorted his followers, eventually numbering about 2,000, to return to the ways of their ancestors and to relinquish the teachings and goods of the intruders.&lt;ref&gt;See: "Smohalla Speaks" in: ''American Indian Prose and Poetry: The Winged Serpent''. An Anthology edited by Margot Astrov. 1946. Capricorn Books Edition, 1962, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best known of a series of prophets in the area, he revived the Washani Religion and the Washat Dance (religion) traditions while introducing other features from his dream or vision. Washani followers believed in the superiority of God and Mother Earth.&lt;ref&gt;"The Waptashi Prophet and the Feather Religion: Derivative of the Washani." Margery Ann Beach. ''American Indian Quarterly'', Vol. 9, No. 3, American Indian Prophets: Religious Leaders and Revitalization Movements (Summer, 1985), pp. 325-333.&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents included the famous [[Chief Joseph]] and his Nez Percé followers as well as Native people from other tribes in the region, such as the Wanapum. One of Smohalla’s chief supporters and assistant was Kotiakan, a [[Yakama]] prophet, who helped him in the revitalization movement.

Despite government opposition and interference, Smohalla practiced his religion until the end of his life. After his death in 1895, he was succeeded by his son Yoyouni (also ''Yo-Yonan''), then by his nephew Puck Hyah Toot. They carried the Smohallan beliefs into the twentieth century.

'''Stefan Lucks''' is a researcher in the fields of [[communications security]] and [[cryptography]]. Lucks is known for his attack on [[Triple DES]], and for extending [[Lars Knudsen]]'s [[Square attack]] to [[Twofish]], a cipher outside the [[Square (cipher)|Square]] family, thus generalising the attack  into [[integral cryptanalysis]].  He has also co-authored attacks on [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]], [[LEVIATHAN (cipher)|LEVIATHAN]], and the [[E0 (cipher)|E0]] cipher used in [[Bluetooth]] devices, as well as publishing strong password-based [[key agreement]] schemes.

Lucks graduated from the [[Dortmund University of Technology|University of Dortmund]] in 1992, and received his PhD at the [[University of Göttingen]] in 1997.
After leaving the [[University of Mannheim]] Lucks now heads the Chair of Media Security at [[Bauhaus University, Weimar]].

Together with [[Niels Ferguson]], [[Bruce Schneier]] and others he developed the [[Skein (hash function)|Skein]] hash function as a candidate for the [[NIST hash function competition]].

'''Stephanie McMillan''' (born 1965) is an American political cartoonist, editorialist, and activist from [[South Florida]]. A granddaughter of the German commercial animator [[Hans Fischerkoesen]], McMillan aspired to become a cartoonist from the age of ten. During her high school years, she began organizing protests against capitalism and imperialism.

==Early life and career==
McMillan graduated from [[Tisch School of the Arts]] at [[New York University]] in 1987 with a BFA in film. During her time at NYU, she studied animation under Richard Protovin and [[John Canemaker]], and received an award for her student film.  In 1992, McMillan was offered her first professional cartooning opportunity as an editorial assistant at XS- magazine/City Link, an alt-newsweekly. By 1999, McMillan began self-syndicating her cartoons, as well as providing exclusive comic features and illustrations for hundreds of publications worldwide. Her work has appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Daily Beast]]'', ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'', ''[[Yes! (U.S. magazine)|Yes! Magazine]]'', ''[[Comic Relief]]'', ''[[Amarillo Globe-News]]'', ''[[Funny Times (newspaper)|Funny Times]]'', [[Yahoo.com]], and the ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]''.
 
Beyond her professional cartooning, McMillan has been an organizer against capitalism and imperialism all her life. The groups she has worked with include One Struggle, Refuse and Resist!, the [[Occupy movement]] throughout the country, U.S. Hands Off the Haitian People's Coalition, and the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade. In 2012, McMillan won the [[Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award]] for Editorial Cartoonists for her work as a political cartoonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cavna|first1=Michael|title=Stephanie McMillan wins RFK Journalism Award for social-justice cartoons|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/stephanie-mcmillan-wins-rfk-journalism-award-for-social-justice-cartoons/2012/05/09/gIQAXxTvBU_blog.html|work=Washington Post|date=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, McMillan’s daily comic strip, [[Minimum Security]], is syndicated online at [[Universal Uclick]]’s gocomics.com. She also draws a weekly editorial cartoon, Code Green, acts as an editor and designer for ''[[The Notebook (magazine)|The Notebook]]'' ([[Association of American Editorial Cartoonists]]), and does freelance illustration and writing. Her own books include ''Capitalism Must Die! A Basic Introduction: What capitalism is, why it sucks, and how to crush it'' (INIP -- Idées Nouvelles Idées Prolétariennes, 2014), ''The Beginning of the American Fall'' ([[Seven Stories Press]], 2012), and ''As The World Burns: 50 Simple Things You Can Do to Stay in Denial'' with [[Derrick Jensen]] ([[Seven Stories Press]], 2007).

{{Ratzinger}}
The '''theology of Pope Benedict XVI''', as promulgated during his pontificate, consists mainly of three [[encyclical]] letters on [[Deus caritas est|love]] (2005), [[Spe Salvi|hope]] (2007), and [[Caritas in veritate|"charity in truth"]] (2009), as well as [[Apostolic constitution|apostolic]] documents and various speeches and interviews. Benedict's theology underwent developments over the years, many of which were characterized by his leadership position in the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], which is entrusted with preserving the [[Catholic faith]] in its entirety. His theology originated in the view that [[God]] speaks to us through the [[Christian Church|Church]] today and not just through the [[Bible]]. The Bible is not a natural science textbook, but rather it is the essential testimonial of God’s revelation. One cannot get from it a scientific explanation of how the world arose; one can only glean religious experience from it. Thus Scripture would not wish to inform us about how the different species of plant life gradually appeared or how the sun and the moon and the stars were established. Its purpose ultimately would be to say one thing: God created the world.&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, ''"In the Beginning...": A Catholic Understanding of the Story of Creation and the Fall'' (Michigan: Wm. B. Erdmans Publishing Co.. 1995), P. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The world is not a chaos of mutually opposed forces; nor is it the dwelling of demonic powers from which human beings must protect themselves. Rather, all of this comes from one power, from God's eternal Reason, which became—in the Word—the power of creation. All of this comes from the same Word of God that we meet in the act of [[faith]]. The Bible was written to help us understand God's eternal Reason. The Holy Scripture in its entirety was not written from beginning to end like a novel or a textbook. It is, rather, the echo of God's history with his people. The theme of [[Creationism|creation]] is not set down once for all in one place; rather, it accompanies [[Israel]] throughout its history, and, indeed, the whole [[Old Testament]] is a journeying with the Word of God. In this respect, the Old and [[New Testament]] belong together. Thus every individual part derives its meaning from the whole, and the whole derives its meaning from Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, ''"In the Beginning...": A Catholic Understanding of the Story of Creation and the Fall'' (Michigan: Wm. B. Erdmans Publishing Co.. 1995), P.9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible is constantly readapting its images to a continually developing way of thinking. In this way, a gradual and interactive process reveals something deeper and greater. Christians do not read the Old Testament for its own sake but always with Christ and through Christ.

==The theology of Pope Benedict XVI==
Pope Benedict XVI, like his predecessors, intended to present the [[Jesus Christ the Logos|Word of God]] to his time. As [[Pope]] and [[Bishop of Rome]] he explained the message of Jesus [[Christ]], utilizing in part the array of theological analysis, methods and axioms, for which he is well known. To some this raised the question of the relation of Pope—theologian and of the distinction of papal teaching and theological point of view. Nevertheless, official theological statements such as encyclical letters constituted part of the theology of Pope Benedict XVI.

===God is Love===
{{See also|Deus caritas est}}

In his first Encyclical as Pope, ''[[Deus caritas est]]'',&lt;ref&gt;ENCYCLICAL LETTER, DEUS CARITAS EST OF THE SUPREME PONTIFF BENEDICT XVI TO THE BISHOPS PRIESTS AND DEACONS MEN AND WOMEN RELIGIOUS AND ALL THE LAY FAITHFUL ON CHRISTIAN LOVE, Vatican 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict XVI describes God as love, and talks about the love which God lavishes upon us and which we in turn must share with others through acts of charity.

His letter has two parts. A theological speculative part, in which he describes "the intrinsic link between that Love and the reality of human love". The second part deals with practical aspects, and calls the world to new energy and commitment in its response to God's love.&lt;ref&gt;Deus Catitas Est, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Benedict writes about love of God, and considers this important and significant, because we live in a time in which "the name of God is sometimes associated with vengeance or even a duty of hatred and violence":

{{quote|We have come to know and to believe in the love God has for us. We have come to believe in God's love: in these words the Christian can express the fundamental decision of his life. Being Christian is not the result of an ethical choice or a lofty idea, but the encounter with an event, a person, which gives life a new horizon and a decisive direction. Saint John's Gospel describes that event in these words: "God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should … have eternal life" (3:16). In acknowledging the centrality of love, Christian faith has retained the core of Israel's faith, while at the same time giving it new depth and breadth. The pious Jew prayed daily the words of the Book of Deuteronomy which expressed the heart of his existence: "Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord, and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul and with all your might" (6:4&amp;ndash;5). Jesus united into a single precept this commandment of love for God and the commandment of love for neighbour found in the Book of Leviticus: "You shall love your neighbour as yourself" (19:18; cf. Mk 12:29&amp;ndash;31). Since God has first loved us (cf. 1 Jn 4:10), love is now no longer a mere "command"; it is the response to the gift of love with which God draws near to us.|Deus caritas est, 1}}

Benedict develops a positive view of sex and Eros in his first encyclical, which finally does away with the traditional Victorian view of the human body. Love between men and women is a gift of God, which should not be exploited:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nowadays Christianity of the past is often criticized as having been opposed to the body; and it is quite true that tendencies of this sort have always existed. ''&lt;ref&gt;''Deus caritas est'', 5&lt;/ref&gt;... but ... Eros, reduced to pure "sex", has become a commodity, a mere "thing" to be bought and sold, or rather, man himself becomes a commodity. This is hardly man's great "yes" to the body. On the contrary, he now considers his body and his sexuality as the purely material part of himself, to be used and exploited at will.&lt;ref&gt;''Deus caritas est'', 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While condemning a view of sexuality as purely for personal enjoyment and selfish desire, Benedict also condemns a view of sex as purely for procreation. Unlike previous writings of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], the document of Pope Benedict does not contain condemnations, indicating a more pastoral approach of the new Pope. At the same time, his discussion of love is implicitly within the confines of conjugal relationships.

===Faith-based hope===
[[File:Benedictus XVI - General audience - Vatican - Jan 16, 2013.jpg|left|250px]]
{{See also|Spe Salvi}}

In his second letter, ''[[Spe Salvi]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Benedict XVI, Encyclical Letter Spe salvi Vatican November 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict XVI explains the concept of faith-based hope in the New Testament and the early Church. Benedict suggests a redirection of often short-sighted hopes. Real hope must be based on faith in God. God is love. Christ, the most manifest expression of God's love, dies on the cross not to end slavery, miseries or other temporal problems.

Benedict argues in his letter against two mistaken notions of hope: 1.) Christians who may have focused their hopes too much on their own eternal salvation, and 2.) those who have placed their hope exclusively on science, rationality, freedom and justice for all, thus excluding any notion of God and eternity. Christians find lasting hope by finding their loving God, and this has real consequences for everyday life:

{{quote|We have raised the question: can our encounter with the God who in Christ has shown us his face and opened his heart be for us too not just "informative" but "performative"—that is to say, can it change our lives, so that we know we are redeemed through the hope that it expresses? Before attempting to answer the question, let us return once more to the early Church. It is not difficult to realize that the experience of the African slave-girl Bakhita was also the experience of many in the period of nascent Christianity who were beaten and condemned to slavery. Christianity did not bring a message of social revolution like that of the ill-fated [[Spartacus]], whose struggle led to so much bloodshed. Jesus was not Spartacus, he was not engaged in a fight for political liberation like [[Barabbas]] or [[Bar-Kochba]]. Jesus, who himself died on the Cross, brought something totally different: an encounter with the Lord of all lords, an encounter with the living God and thus an encounter with a hope stronger than the sufferings of slavery, a hope which therefore transformed life and the world from within.|Spe Salvi, 4}}

Benedict refers to [[St. Paul]], who wrote from prison "Paul is sending the slave back to the master from whom he had fled, not ordering but asking: 'I appeal to you for my child ... whose father I have become in my imprisonment ... I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart ... perhaps this is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back for ever, no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother'" (Philem 10&amp;ndash;16).&lt;ref name="Spe Salvi, 4"&gt;Spe Salvi, 4&lt;/ref&gt; He refers then to the Letter to the Hebrews, which says that Christians here on earth do not have a permanent homeland, but seek one which lies in the future (cf. Heb 11:13&amp;ndash;16; Phil 3:20).

To Benedict, this does '''not''' mean for one moment that they lived only for the future: present society is recognized by Christians as an exile; they belong to a new society which is the goal of their common pilgrimage and which is anticipated in the course of that pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;Spe Salvi 4&lt;/ref&gt; A Christian has a present and future, because of the hope for Jesus Christ, which is life changing.&lt;ref&gt;Spe Salvi, 2&lt;/ref&gt; All serious and upright human conduct is hope in action.&lt;ref&gt;Spe Salvi 35&lt;/ref&gt; This hope gives a realistic perspective to understanding suffering and helping others: We can try to limit suffering, to fight against it, but we cannot eliminate it. It is when we attempt to avoid suffering by withdrawing from anything that might involve hurt, when we try to spare ourselves the effort and pain of pursuing truth, love, and goodness, that we drift into a life of emptiness, in which there may be almost no pain, but the dark sensation of meaninglessness and abandonment is all the greater.

Benedict believes that not by sidestepping or fleeing from suffering are we healed, but rather by our capacity for accepting it, maturing through it and finding meaning through union with Christ, who suffered with infinite love.&lt;ref&gt;Spe Salvi 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Eucharist and the Church===
In a special letter on the Eucharist and the Church, Benedict describes the Eucharist, causal principle of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Sacramentum Caritatis: Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation on the Eucharist as the Source and Summit of the Church's Life and Mission (February 22, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Through the sacrament of the Eucharist Jesus draws the faithful into his "hour; " he shows us the bond that he willed to establish between himself and us, between his own person and the Church|Sacramentum Caritatis, 14}}

He opines that the Church was founded by Christ in the sacrifice of the Cross. At the same time, he describes the Church as his Bride and his body. This concept, the Church as the mystical body of Christ, goes back to St. Paul and has been subject to many conversations by The Fathers of the Church but also more recently at Vatican II.

A contemplative gaze "upon him whom they have pierced" (Jn 19:37) leads us to reflect on the causal connection between Christ's sacrifice, the Eucharist and the Church. The Church "draws her life from the Eucharist" (31). Since the Eucharist makes present Christ's redeeming sacrifice, we must start by acknowledging that "there is a causal influence of the Eucharist at the Church's very origins."&lt;ref&gt;Sacramentum Caritatis, 32&lt;/ref&gt; The Eucharist is Christ who gives himself to us and continually builds us up as his body. Hence, in the striking interplay between the Eucharist which builds up the Church, and the Church herself which "makes" the Eucharist, the&lt;ref&gt;Sacramentum Caritatis, 33&lt;/ref&gt; primary causality is expressed in the first formula: the Church is able to celebrate and adore the mystery of Christ present in the Eucharist precisely because Christ first gave himself to her in the sacrifice of the Cross. The Church's ability to "make" the Eucharist is completely rooted in Christ's self-gift to her.

What does this mean? According to Benedict, the Eucharist which is union with Christ has a profound impact on our social relations. Because "union with Christ is also union with all those to whom he gives himself. I cannot possess Christ just for myself; I can belong to him only in union with all those who have become, or who will become, his own."&lt;ref&gt;Sacramentum Caritatis, 241&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The relationship between the Eucharistic mystery and social commitment must be made explicit. The Eucharist is the sacrament of communion between brothers and sisters who allow themselves to be reconciled in Christ, who made of Jews and pagans one people, tearing down the wall of hostility which divided them (cf. Eph 2:14). Only this constant impulse towards reconciliation enables us to partake worthily of the Body and Blood of Christ (cf. Mt 5:23&amp;ndash;24).|Sacramentum Caritatis, 242}}

==Theology, science and the dialogue with other cultures==
{{see also|Regensburg Lecture}}
In an address to the faculty at the University of [[Regensburg]], Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Quoted as Benedict XVI, Meeting with the representatives of science in the Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg (September 12, 2006), Vatican, 2006. source: http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060912_university-regensburg_en.html&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict discussed the preconditions for an effective [[dialogue]] with [[Islam]] and other [[cultures]]. This requires a review of [[theology]] and [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;This speech contained a negative citation of a medieval emperor on Islam, which weeks later caused some controversies and clarifications from the Vatican&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope considers the modern concept of science too narrow in the long run, because it allows the determination of "[[certainty]]" only from the interplay of mathematical and empirical elements. "Anything that would claim to be science must be measured against this criterion. Hence the [[human sciences]], such as [[history]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[philosophy]], attempt to conform themselves to this canon of science".&lt;ref name="Benedict XVI 2006"&gt;Benedict XVI, Meeting with the representatives of science in the Aula Magna of the University of Regensburg (September 12, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

This limited view of scientific method excludes the question of [[God]], making it appear an [[unscientific]] or pre-scientific question. For philosophy and, albeit in a different way, for theology, listening to the great [[experiences]] and insights of the religious traditions of [[human]]ity, and those of the [[Christian faith]] in particular, is a source of [[knowledge]], and to ignore it would be an unacceptable restriction of our listening and responding.

{{quote|The West has long been endangered by this [[wikt:Special:Search/aversion|aversion]] to the questions which underlie its [[rationality]], and can only suffer great [[harm]] thereby|[[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s [[Regensburg Lecture]]&lt;ref name="Benedict XVI 2006"/&gt;}}

Benedict acknowledges "unreservedly" the many positive aspects of modern science, and considers the quest for truth as essential to the Christian spirit, but he favours a broadening our narrow concept of [[reason]] and its application to include philosophical and theological experiences, not only as an aim in itself but so we may enter as a culture the dialogue with the other religions and cultures from a broader [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]:

{{quote|Only thus do we become capable of that genuine dialogue of cultures and religions so urgently needed today. In the Western world it is widely held that only positivistic reason and the forms of philosophy based on it are universally valid. Yet the world's profoundly religious cultures see this exclusion of the divine from the universality of reason as an attack on their most profound convictions. A reason which is deaf to the divine and which relegates religion into the realm of subcultures is incapable of entering into the dialogue of cultures.|[[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s [[Regensburg Lecture]]&lt;ref name="Benedict XVI 2006"/&gt;}}

This objective of Pope Benedict XVI has so far not been widely reviewed.

==Theology of Joseph Ratzinger==

=== Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ===
[[File:Joseph Ratzinger cardinal4.jpg|right|250px]]
Ratzinger became known as a theologian through his position at the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], which he headed until his election to the Papacy. It has been frequently overlooked that he opened up his congregation to [[theological]] and [[historical]] [[research]], by providing greater access to the [[Archive of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]]. On January 22, 1998, the Ratzinger congregation made publicly available all [[Inquisition]] archive documents dated before and up to the death of [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1903.

In absence of a large body of papal teachings of Benedict XVI, the Ratzinger theology is often cited. While there are likely to be many similarities between the teachings of Benedict and Ratzinger, the theology of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger has been somewhat unusual because of his "watchdog" office, which required him to address a larger variety of issues. Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger was much on his own, since he had only a small staff at the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]].

Young Ratzinger was something of a "rebel",{{According to whom|date=August 2015}} who early on discarded the [[Thomism]] of his professors and much of the dominant traditional school theology.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} He viewed the early proposals for Vatican II "as narrow, stiff and insufficiently pastoral."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, Aus meinem Leben, Erinnerungen, DVA, 1997, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the seventies, Ratzinger felt that he had finally developed his own theological view.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, Aus meinem Leben, Erinnerungen, DVA, 1997, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

====Karl Rahner's question====
This "own theological view" has raised questions by critical liberal theologians, like [[Hans Küng]] and [[Karl Rahner]].

{{quote|It would be important for him to distinguish between Ratzinger the theologian, with his justified and maybe at times problematical positions, and Ratzinger the Prefect of the Congregation of Faith. Every Roman prelate has a right to his own theological views. But he should not use his Office to force them on others. This difference is important but of course also very difficult to carry out in practice.|Karl Rahner&lt;ref&gt;Karl Rahner, Bekenntnisse, Rückblick auf 80 Jahre, Herold, Munich, 1984, p.40&amp;ndash;41&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Karl Rahner raises these issues. Does the Prefect defend "only" the official [[Magisterium]], Church teachings within the framework of [[Canon Law]]? If so, he is clearly speaking for the Church and not on his own. Does he in so-called gray areas of theology, ''[[questiones disputatae]],'' where the Magisterium has not ruled, impose his theological view on others?

Ratzinger's own theological view began with an open rebellion against powerful established [[Thomist]] theology.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Divine revelation===
It all began with the "drama of my dissertation", as he called it,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, Aus meinem Leben, Erinnerungen, DVA, 1997, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; a seemingly unimportant postdoctoral degree on [[Bonaventure]], which he was almost denied because of serious reservations of some conservative professors with his interpretation of [[divine revelation]].
Ratzinger held that God reveals and revealed himself in [[history]] and throughout history and not just once to the [[authors of the Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kardinal Ratzinger, Aus meinem Leben, Erinnerungen, DVA, 1997, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; He further held that the static bible-based concept of divine revelation was nonexistent in the thirteenth century. Ratzinger contradicted traditional Catholic theology, which led to a bitter fight. Ratzinger passed after hours of heated debate, just barely. But he had established himself as an independent thinker.

His theology on revelation was discussed during [[Second Vatican Council]]. In Rome he continued the view that revelation, meaning God communicates with us, is always more than can be expressed in purely human words. God’s revelation is not a big cold stone fallen from heaven many years ago, a stone which only needs to be dissected and analyzed. God has a living message to us.

{{quote|I refer to what might be called Christian positivism. Christian belief is not merely concerned with the eternal, the “totally other”, … on the contrary, it is much more concerned with God in history, with God as man. By thus seeming to bridge the gulf between eternal and temporal, between visible and invisible, by making us meet God as man, the eternal as the temporal, as one of us, it knows itself as revelation|Joseph Ratzinger, Introduction to Christianity, Seabury, New York, 1979, p. 27}}

====Theology of covenant====
In his [[Covenantal Theology (Roman Catholic)|theology of covenant]], Benedict provides a unified interpretation of Scripture centered on the person and work of Jesus, with implications ranging from the Eucharist to the proper understanding of ecumenism.&lt;ref&gt;stephenpimentel.com ''The Master Key: Pope Benedict XVI's Theology of Covenant'' {{cite web |url=http://stephenpimentel.tripod.com/papers/benedict.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717103816/http://stephenpimentel.tripod.com/papers/benedict.html |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict holds that Christology must be rooted the covenantal theology of the New Testament, which is grounded in the unity of the entire Bible. In this covenantal theology, the Abrahamic covenant, as fulfilled by the new covenant, is seen as fundamental and enduring, whereas the Mosaic covenant is intervening (Rom. 5:20).  The covenantal promises given to Abraham guarantee the continuity of salvation history, from the patriarchs to Jesus and the Church, which is open to Jews and Gentiles alike. The Last Supper served to seal the new covenant, and the Eucharist is an ongoing reenactment of this covenant renewal. Following the Letter to the Hebrews, Benedict describes Jesus death, along with the Eucharist, in which the blood of Jesus is offered to the Father, as the perfect realization of the Day of Atonement (cf. Heb. 9:11&amp;ndash;14, 24&amp;ndash;26).

====Role of the Church====
To comprehend God's ongoing revelation is why the Church is important at all ages.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kardinal Ratzinger, Aus meinem Leben, Erinnerungen, DVA, 1997, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict's view of the church, [[ecclesiology]] places much emphasis on the Catholic Church and its institutions, as the instrument by which God's message manifests itself on Earth: a view of the Church's universal worldwide role which tends to resist local pressure to submit to external social trends in specific countries or cultures.

As such, like all his predecessors, he does not view the search for moral truth as a dialectic and incremental process, arguing that essential matters of faith and morals are universally true and therefore must be determined at the universal level: "the universal church ... takes precedence, ontologically and temporally, over the individual local churches. " Accordingly, too, he was often seen as a key player in the centralization of the hierarchy under John Paul II.

====Role of liturgy====
The ongoing revelation of God is also the reason why Pope Benedict XVI puts so much emphasis on sacred [[liturgy]], and why he abhorred often tasteless experiments with it. To him the crisis of the Church is a crisis of the liturgy, in which clergy and community too often backslap and celebrate each other and themselves, almost as if God did not exist.

{{quote|There is more and more a tendency today, to resolve the Christian religion completely into brotherly love, fellowship, and not to admit any direct love of God or adoration of God... It is not difficult to see, ... how this at first sight very attractive conception fails to grasp not only the substance of Christianity but also that of true humanity. Brotherly love that aimed at self-sufficiency would become for this very reason the extreme egoism of self-assertion. |Joseph Ratzinger (1979)&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Ratzinger, Introduction to Christianity, Seabury, New York, 1979, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To Pope Benedict XVI, liturgy means openness to God, community of faith, worldwide unity with the Church and its history; it means “celebrating the mystery of the living Christ”.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kardinal Ratzinger, Aus meinem Leben, Erinnerungen, DVA, 1997, p.174&lt;/ref&gt; To get there, Ratzinger calls for an almost revolution like [[liturgical movement]] to rekindle the spirit of Vatican II. Not surprisingly at one of the first masses of his pontificate he urged Catholics to show a greater [[worship|devotion]] to the "[[Eucharist]]ic [[Jesus]]. "

====Continuity of Vatican II====
{{quote|None of the Council Fathers saw an end of the Middle Ages or a revolution. It was viewed as a continuation of the reforms initiated by Pius X and systematically but gently continued by Pius XII.|Joseph Kardinal Ratzinger, Aus meinem Leben, Erinnerungen, DVA, 1997, p.104}}

This Ratzinger quote on the liturgical reform of the council is symbolic for his interpretation of Vatican II. He has spoken only positively about the [[Vatican II]] council, but differentiated between the council and a spirit of the council, which has nothing in common with its texts and resolutions. As noted above, believes that essential elements of the Council, such as the spirit if liturgy still need to materialize and has shown no evidence that he intends to reverse or limit the decisions of that council. He has, however, stated in books and interviews that Vatican II did not represent a radical break; a new age, but a more pastoral reformulation of old truths earlier doctrine, but applied the teachings of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] and [[church fathers]] to the contemporary world. Indeed, the council documents quoted 205 times the allegedly conservative Pope Pius XII more than any other person.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Huber, Pius XII, Vorläufer des 2.vatikanischen Konzils, in Konstantin, Prinz von Bayern, Pius XII, Stein am Rhein, 1980, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict has also spoken out against some post-conciliar innovations, especially liturgical novelties, which forget their purpose, and he continues to remind the faithful that the Council did not entirely do away with the former rite and many of its noble features.

In the pre-conclave mass to the assembled cardinals in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], he warned, "We are moving toward a dictatorship of [[relativism]] which does not recognize anything as definitive and has as its highest value one's own ego and one's own desires."

In his Christmas address to the Roman Curia, he asked that Council be interpreted not with the "hermeneutic of discontinuity and rupture" but with the "hermeneutic of reform, of renewal in the continuity of the one subject-Church which the Lord has given to us." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2005/december/documents/hf_ben_xvi_spe_20051222_roman-curia.html|title=Christmas greetings to the Members of the Roman Curia and Prelature (December 22, 2005) {{!}} BENEDICT XVI|website=w2.vatican.va|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theological opinions===
Pope John Paul II and Benedict strongly opposed [[liberation theology]] as a political movement. Benedict has acknowledged the good aspects of [[charismatic Catholicism]] while at the same time "providing some cautions."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewtn.com Charismatic Renewal, Ecclesiastical Acknowledgementd&lt;/ref&gt;

Benedict is a theologian in an orthodox vein. His theology aims at a synthesis of [[Thomism]], philosophical [[personalism]] {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} (with such proponents as [[Martin Buber]], John Paul II—tempered however by [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and, more recently, [[Leon Kass]]) and the '[[Nouvelle Théologie]]' of [[Henri de Lubac]] and [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]]. This is a sharp contrast with the school of thought, until recently ascendant in the theological academy of Europe and the United States, represented by [[Karl Rahner]], [[Hans Küng]], and [[Schillebeeckx|Edward Schillebeeckx]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Dialogue with other faiths==
[[File:BentoXVI-30-10052007.jpg|right|200px]]
Cardinal Ratzinger's approach to ecumenical dialogue was fundamentally centered on his [[Covenantal Theology (Roman Catholic)|theology of covenant]], as described in his work ''Many Religions—One Covenant: Israel, the Church, and the World'' (1999). In 2000, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a document entitled ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'', which created a lot of controversy. Some religious groups took offense to the document because it allegedly stated that "only in the Catholic Church is the eternal salvation. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www. theaustralian.news.com. au April 18, 2005. Nazi link may dog favourite&lt;/ref&gt; However this statement appears nowhere in the document. The document condemned "relativistic theories" of religious pluralism and described other faiths as "gravely deficient" in the means of salvation. The document was primarily aimed at reining in liberal Catholic theologians like [[Jacques Dupuis (Jesuit)|Jacques Dupuis]], who argued that other religions could contain God-given means of salvation not found in the Church of Christ, but it offended many religious leaders. Jewish religious leaders boycotted several interfaith meetings in protest.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com April 24, 2005. Crossing Cardinal Nein&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Christian denominations===
{{main|Pope Benedict XVI and ecumenism}}
A remarkable but unappreciated aspect of ''Dominus Iesus'' can be found in [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000806_dominus-iesus_lt.html the official Latin text], in which the famous [[filioque clause|"filioque" clause]] ("and the Son") is quietly omitted. The changed Latin sentence reads "Et in Spiritum Sanctum (…), qui ex Patre procedit" ("and in the Holy Spirit (…), who proceeds from the Father") instead of "qui ex Patre Filioque procedit" ("who proceeds from the Father and the Son"). The filioque clause has been a source of conflict between [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Orthodox Church]] for about one thousand years. Leaving it out may be seen as Ratzinger's attempt to reach a hand across the theological/historical chasm separating Eastern and Western Churches. ''Dominus Iesus'' also went on to state that any church outside of the Catholic Church lacks "the fullness of the means of salvation", stating that the Catholic Church is the [[one true church]]. In 2007, the Pope approved a document which stated that Orthodox churches were defective because they did not recognize the primacy of the Pope, and that other Christian denominations were not true churches because they lacked apostolic succession; a move which sparked criticism from Orthodox and Protestant denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19692094/|title=Pope: Other denominations not true churches|date=2007-07-10|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2017-07-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,288841,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Pope: Other Christian Denominations Not True Churches | date=July 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/10/world/main3037922.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Pope: Only One "True" Church | date=July 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratzinger's election as pope was met with enthusiasm from many prominent Anglicans. The Archbishop of Canterbury described Ratzinger as "a theologian of great stature, who has written some profound reflections on the nature of God and the church". Scotland's senior Anglican Bishop Idris Jones also had a positive view of the new pope and stated "I offer the warmest of welcomes to the new Pope…under his leadership the church will continue to work for the poor and underprivileged in the world. " However, an Anglican-council of bishops rejected the Pope's view of Catholic authority which was mirrored by Benedict's refusal to alter the Catholic position on refusing to recognise the [[Church of England]].

===Judaism===
Even before becoming pope, Benedict advocated a "special relationship" between the Roman Church and the Jewish faith. Some Jewish organisations, such as the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, the Union of Reform Judaism, and the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston, believe Ratzinger was responsible for Pope John Paul II's attempts to improve Jewish-Catholic ties. However, Pope Benedict did create some controversy when he said that the Church is waiting for the moment when Jews will "say yes to Christ." He went on to say, "We believe that. The fact remains, however, that our Christian conviction is that Christ is also the Messiah of Israel."

===Islam===
{{Main|Pope Benedict XVI and Islam}}

Pope Benedict XVI called for Christians "to open their arms and hearts" to Muslim immigrants and "to dialogue" with them on religious issues. The Pope also called on peaceful talk with Muslims and was against the [[Iraq War|War in Iraq]] and gravely concerned about events around the Middle East.

===Buddhism===
Though his advent was congratulated by Buddhist leaders around the world,{{ref|phayul}}{{ref|chosun}} critics remembered that in March 1997 Cardinal Ratzinger predicted that [[Buddhism]] would, over the coming century, replace Marxism as the main "enemy" of the Catholic Church. Some also criticized him for calling Buddhism an "[[Autoeroticism|autoerotic]] spirituality" that offered "transcendence without imposing concrete religious obligations", though that might be a mistranslation from the French ''auto-erotisme'', which more properly translates to self-absorption, or [[narcissism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldjewishcongress.org April 19, 2005.

==Past and present views on social issues==
[[File:Ratzinger-Rom88.JPG|left|250px]]
Before becoming Pope, Cardinal Ratzinger was a well-known and quite controversial figure inside and outside the Catholic Church. This is due in part from the perception among those who felt the Vatican II reforms did not go far enough that Ratzinger is a conservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/theologian-hans-kueng-on-pope-benedict-a-putinization-of-the-catholic-church-a-787325.html| work=Spiegel.de | title=Theologian Hans Kung on Pope Benedict: 'A Putinization of the Catholic Church' | date=2011-09-21 | accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this view, Ratzinger's theology is based on his early works, staunch Catholicism and ancient [[Tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/4182605/article-Is-Pope-Benedict-XVI-a-closet-liberal- |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316062357/http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/4182605/article-Is-Pope-Benedict-XVI-a-closet-liberal- |archivedate=2011-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this often held view, Benedict has made clear that he intends to preserve the [[Catholic Church|Church]] [[doctrine]] and not give in to modern pressures for change to fundamental dogma and teaching on such issues as birth control, abortion, and homosexuality. It is also noted, that the Pope has a strong opposition to [[moral relativism]], which he sees as producing views ranging "from one extreme to the other: from [[Marxism]] to [[liberalism]], even to [[libertinism]]; from [[collectivism]] to radical individualism; from [[atheism]] to a vague religious [[mysticism]]; from [[agnosticism]] to [[syncretism]], and so forth."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hughhewitt.com April 18, 2005. Cardinal Ratzinger Spells It Out for You&lt;/ref&gt;

Benedict XVI's views appear to be similar to those of his predecessor, [[Pope John Paul II]], in maintaining the traditional positions on [[birth control]], [[abortion]], and [[homosexuality]] and promoting [[Catholic social teaching]]. In his biography journalist John L Allen, Jr. portrayed Cardinal Ratzinger as a figure that sometimes expressed more conservative views than Pope John Paul II, during the time he was Pope. As Pope Benedict was noted for being less outspoken than predicted. Benedict has criticized [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]] and the [[cloning]] of human embryos. He has said that even "good goals" cannot justify such means. Benedict, in his most recent book, indicated that evolution, although more than a theory, was still not and as a scientific theory could not be definitively proven and that in any case, the creation and evolution of the universe and its matter could not comprehensively be explained by empirical, existential, logical methods of science &amp;ndash; necessitating other disciplines like philosophy and theology to fill in where science could not be wholly applied or where questions were not solveable by, or in the realm of, the sciences.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} &lt;!--- Which book? Where to find it? --&gt;

Although teaching opposition to [[death penalty]], he has stated that there may be among Catholics a "legitimate diversity of opinion"{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} &lt;!--- This reference is not an adequate source for this statement, or even on this subject matter. &lt;ref&gt;http://www. goveg.com April 19, 2005. Pope Condemns Factory Farming: Benedict XVI Continues Tradition of Papal Concern for Animals. (See also John Berkman, "The Consumption of Animals and the Catholic Tradition, " Logos 7:1, Winter 2004.)&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

He has also defended the traditional Church position on the indissolubility of marriage and thus rejected that the divorced be allowed to remarry during their spouses' lifetime. In a 1994 letter to the bishops he said that those who do so are not in a state to receive communion.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Griffin, New Pope a Strong Critic of Modern War. Traditional Catholic Reflections&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratzinger has maintained that the Catholic Church does not possess the authority to [[Ordination of women|ordain women]] to the [[Holy Orders|priestly sacramental ministry]] (the Vatican, and the Catholic Church by extension, have long held that this is shown by [[Jesus]]'s choosing only men as [[Twelve apostles|apostles]], saying this was the constant practice and consistent teaching of the Church).

During the 1980s, as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, he criticized [[Liberation theology|liberation theologians]] and twice silenced proponent [[Leonardo Boff]].

In ''The Spirit of the Liturgy'' in 2000, Ratzinger attacked [[Rock and Roll]] as "the expression of elemental passions" and described some rock concerts as becoming "a form of worship … in opposition to Christian worship. " However, he is a great lover of [[european classical music|classical]] and [[folk music]], and included much new music into his recent pastoral visit to [[Cologne]].

===The dignity and inclusion of gays===
For several decades, questions have been raised{{By whom|date=April 2011}}, especially in the USA and Western Europe, regarding the access of gays to Catholic services as an indication of their non-discrimination. The Church under Pope John Paul II and Cardinal Ratzinger took the position based on the traditional [[Magisterium]] of the [[Catholic Church]], that while confirming respect for individuals, and showing "great respect for these people who also suffer", gay wedding services are not to be tolerated in the church and that [[Church facilities]] cannot be made available for them.

====Homosexuality and LGBT rights====
{{See also|Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism}}

[[LGBT rights]] advocates widely criticized his 1986 letter to the Bishops of the Church, [[On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons]], in which he stated that "although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder." However, then Cardinal Ratzinger also said: "It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs."

In a separate letter dated September 30, 1985, Ratzinger reprimanded [[Seattle]] Archbishop [[Raymond Hunthausen]] for his unorthodox views on women, homosexuals, and doctrinal issues, stating, "The Archdiocese should withdraw all support from any group, which does not unequivocally accept the teaching of the [[Magisterium]] concerning the intrinsic evil of homosexual activity. " Archbishop Hunthausen was temporarily relieved of his authority.&lt;ref&gt;monasticdialog.com March 2000. Book Review: John Paul II and Interreligious Dialogue&lt;/ref&gt;

====Same-sex marriage and gay adoption====
The Pontiff also holds the traditional Catholic views on [[same-sex marriage]]; in 2004 he said to the Italian newspaper ''La Repubblica'' "Above all, we must have great respect for these people who also suffer and who want to find their own way of correct living (also including those who wish to try to be gay and celibate). On the other hand, to create a legal form of a kind of homosexual marriage, in reality, does not help these people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4464113.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} World {{!}} Europe {{!}} Pope Benedict XVI in his own words|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope later described gay marriage as "pseudo-matrimony" and declared that "The various forms of the dissolution of matrimony today, like free unions, trial marriages…by people of the same sex, are rather expressions of an anarchic freedom that wrongly passes for true freedom of man."

Benedict XVI is also against gay couples adopting children; he wrote a Vatican paper concerned with the adoption of children into same-sex couples. "Allowing children to be adopted by persons living in such unions would actually mean doing violence to these children, in the sense that their condition of dependency would be used to place them in an environment that is not conducive to their full human development. "

===AIDS===
In 1988 a debate within the Catholic Church over the use of [[condom]]s to prevent [[AIDS]] sparked controversy again. The Church in 1968 had already stated in [[Humanae Vitae]] that chemical and barrier methods of contraception went against Church teachings. The debate was over the different issue of whether or not condoms could be used, not as contraceptives, but as a means of preventing the spread of [[HIV]]/AIDS and other [[sexually transmitted diseases]]. In 1987, the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|U. S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]] issued a document suggesting that education on the use of condoms could be an acceptable part of an anti-AIDS program.

In response, Cardinal Ratzinger stated that such an approach "would result in at least the facilitation of evil" – not merely its toleration. For the full text of the letter, see: [[s:On "The Many Faces of AIDS"|On "The Many Faces of AIDS"]] (See also Karol Wojtyla's-the future Pope John Paul II's- ''[[Love and Responsibility]]''). Critics argue that Ratzinger's approach would lead to increases in the frequency of HIV/AIDS infections, while many Catholics dispute this and emphasize the value of faithful relationships or [[chastity]], as it is scientifically impossible to contract the disorder without having sex with an infected person, unless via some other means such as a blood transfusion or sharing a needle.

===Abortion and politics===
In the [[United States]], during the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential campaign]], Cardinal Ratzinger stated that voters would be "cooperating in evil" if they voted for a political candidate precisely because of the candidate’s permissive stand on [[abortion law|legalized abortion]] or [[euthanasia]].  He further stated, however, that voting for these candidates for other reasons of commensurate gravity in spite of their stand concerning abortion/euthanasia was justifiable in principle. Ratzinger generated further controversy by supporting the [[canon 915|denial of Holy Communion]] to these politicians. He did add, however, that bishops should only withhold [[Eucharist|communion]] after meeting with, teaching and warning politicians first.&lt;ref&gt;''Boston Globe'': [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/06/24/cardinal_sees_risk_in_withholding_communion/?camp=pm Cardinal sees risk in withholding Communion.]  June 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of animals===
Although not a vegetarian, the new Pope has spoken about the exploitation of all beings, particularly of farmed animals. When he was asked about cruelty to animals in a 2002 interview, he said, "That is a very serious question. At any rate, we can see that they are given into our care, that we cannot just do whatever we want with them. Animals, too, are God's creatures… Certainly, a sort of industrial use of creatures, so that geese are fed in such a way as to produce as large a liver as possible, or hens live so packed together that they become just caricatures of birds, this degrading of living creatures to a commodity seems to me in fact to contradict the relationship of mutuality that comes across in the Bible." Cardinal Ratzinger was echoing official church teachings laid out in the Catholic Catechism, which states clearly that “"Animals are God’s creatures. He surrounds them with His providential care. By their mere existence they bless Him and give Him glory. Thus men owe them kindness. We should recall the gentleness with which saints like [[St. Francis of Assisi]] or [[St. Philip Neri]] treated animals... It is contrary to human dignity to cause animals to suffer or die needlessly."&lt;ref&gt;Pope Benedict XVI. God and the world: a conversation with Peter Seewald. San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2002; 78 http://www.ignatius.com/Products/GODW-P/god-and-the-world.aspx?src=iinsight&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and other issues===
[[File:Bush and Benedictus 81st birthday 2008.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Benedict XVI with [[George W. Bush]] at the [[White House]] in 2008]]
"There were not sufficient reasons to unleash a war against Iraq," he said on a press conference in 2003. "To say nothing of the fact that, given the new weapons that make possible destructions that go beyond the combatant groups, today we should be asking ourselves if it is still licit to admit the very existence of a '[[Just War|just war]]'.&lt;ref&gt;catholiceducation.org October 2004.

Uganda's AIDS Decline Attributed to Deaths www. washingtonpost.com March 8, 2005. Faulty Conclusion On AIDS in Uganda&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[CNN]], Ratzinger has condemned [[Communism]] by calling the Soviet Union "a shame of our time", and unbridled [[capitalism]] by saying, "We must coordinate the free market with the sense of responsibility of one towards the other."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defide.com March 20, 2004. John Paul II speech on Euthanasia.&lt;/ref&gt; He has repeatedly criticized the materialization of life and the "greed society".

In the spring of 2005 Pope Benedict opposed a [[referendum]] in [[Italy]], which aimed at [[Liberalism|liberalising]] a restrictive law about [[artificial insemination]] and [[embryonic stem cell research]]. This was the first direct intervention in Italian politics since the collapse of the [[Democrazia Cristiana]] party. The most active person inside the Church was Cardinal [[Camillo Ruini]], but Benedict XVI gave him clear support.

Particular controversy was stirred up by the Italian clergy's strategy of restraining Italians from voting. Since the referendum had been called on a summer weekend, turn out was expected to be low. Not voting would have helped invalidate the referendum, which needed to reach a [[quorum]] of 50% of voters, whereas voting "No" (i. e. to maintain the current legislation) might have helped reaching it, making the referendum valid and therefore actually helping the "Yes" advocates. Critics of this tactic argue that this misplaced non-voters into the "No" front, though the same could be said the other way around. It was also alleged that it hampered the secrecy of the vote.

===Harry Potter books===
A short (three-sentence) letter from Cardinal Ratzinger to [[Germany|German]] writer [[Gabriele Kuby]] dated March 7, 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2005_docs/ratzingerletter.pdf|title=News {{!}} LifeSite|last=Inc.|first=Piccirilli Dorsey,|website=LifeSiteNews|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (quoted here in unofficial English translation)&lt;ref&gt;A similar translation (edited above) is found at http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2005/jul/05071301.html&lt;/ref&gt; thanked her for sending him a copy of her "informative" book. "It is good that you enlighten people about Harry Potter, because these are subtle seductions which act imperceptibly and thereby deeply, and dissolve Christianity in the soul before it can grow properly. " Kuby's book, ''Harry Potter; Gut oder böse?'' ("Harry Potter; Good or evil?", {{ISBN|3-928929-43-7}}), was about the literary phenomenon of [[Harry Potter]], and sought to prove that the Harry Potter books would "corrupt" the religious spirit of young generations and to refute the rumours that Pope John Paul II liked the series. Kuby later asked permission to refer to this comment, which was given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2005_docs/ratzingerpermission.pdf|title=News {{!}} LifeSite|last=Inc.|first=Piccirilli Dorsey,|website=LifeSiteNews|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much was made of this in some media circles after the letter was posted on the web in 2005. Catholic commentators noted that it was not binding on Catholics, and expressed various opinions on Harry Potter.&lt;ref&gt;See links to some of the Catholic and media commentators at http://www.ratzingerfanclub.com/blog/2005/07/pope-benedict-xvi-and-harry-potter.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galileo affair===
In 1990 Ratzinger commented on the [[Galileo affair]], and quoted philosopher [[Paul Feyerabend]] as saying that the Church's verdict against Galileo had been "rational and just".&lt;ref name="scupper"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7188860.stm|title=Papal visit scuppered by scholars|date=2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 1992, [[Pope John Paul II]] expressed regret for how the Galileo affair was handled, and conceded that theologians of the time erred with their understanding that literal interpretation of scripture imposes physical understanding of the natural world.&lt;ref name="scupper"/&gt; In January 2008 Ratzinger cancelled a visit to [[La Sapienza University]] in Rome, following a protest letter signed by sixty-seven academics which said he condoned the 1633 trial and conviction of Galileo for heresy.&lt;ref name="scupper"/&gt;

      <comment>/* Third Succession Act */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6682">The '''will of Henry VIII of England''' was a significant constitutional document, or set of contested documents created in the 1530s and 1540s, and affecting English and Scottish politics for the rest of the 16th century. In conjunction with legislation passed by the English Parliament, it was supposed to have a regulative effect in deciding the succession to the three following monarchs of the [[House of Tudor]], the three legitimate and illegitimate children, (the [[Third Succession Act]] expressly  recognised the  illegitimacy of Henry's daughters) of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII of England]]. Its actual legal and constitutional status was much debated; and arguably the [[succession to Elizabeth I]] did not respect Henry's wishes.

==Last testament==
Henry VIII made a final revision to his last will and testament on  30 December 1546. It was signed using the "dry stamp", a device in use since 1545, and under the control of [[Anthony Denny]] and [[John Gates (courtier)|John Gates]]. It confirmed the line of succession as Edward, Mary and Elizabeth; following them, the Grey and Suffolk families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=12955|title=Henry VIII|first=E. W.|last=Ives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=10448|title=Gates, Sir John|first=Narasingha P.|last=Sil}}&lt;/ref&gt; The will was read, stamped and sealed on 27 January 1547, when the dying king was past speech. He died within hours, the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David Starkey]]|title=The Reign of Henry VIII: Personalities and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSU2D6KALvEC&amp;pg=PA143|year=2002|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0-09-944510-4|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document still exists, but this fact was not generally known or accepted by the 1560s, when some believed it was lost, or had been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 16 executors==
The will appointed 16 executors. This body had little impact in the short term, because its powers were given to a smaller group. It was officially (with one other) the council of [[Edward VI of England]] until 12 March 1547, after which Protector Somerset nominated the council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D. E. Hoak|title=The King's Council in the Reign of Edward VI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sng6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA259|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-20866-6|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effective end of the [[Somerset Protectorate]] came in early 1550. Those executors who were still alive (13 of the original 16, after Browne, Denny and then Wriothesley had died) had a leading constitutional role, in theory from 13 October 1549.&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]]|title=Thomas Cranmer|year=1996|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0 300 07448 4|page=447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executors comprised:&lt;ref name="Poll"&gt;[[Albert Frederick Pollard]], ''England under Protector Somerset: an essay'' (1900), pp. 20–1; [https://archive.org/stream/englandunderpro03pollgoog#page/n37/mode/2up archive.org.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollard wrote that the traditional view, that the balance of the group of executors on the religious question was deliberately poised to create an equilibrium, is mistaken: the exclusion of [[Stephen Gardiner]] tipped the balance to the evangelical reformers.&lt;ref name="Poll"/&gt; MacCulloch considers that in 1550, after the fall of Somerset, there was a balance, but that the evangelicals manoeuvred to a position of superiority.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;

==Third Succession Act==
[[File:Succession to Elizabeth JG Nichols.png|thumb|Notes by [[John Gough Nichols]], showing the effect of the will of Henry VIII on the succession to the throne of England]]
The constitutional standing of Henry VIII's last will depended on the [[Third Succession Act]] that received the royal assent in 1544. Section VI of the act provides that the line of succession, if not continued by the king's children by his marriages, should be regulated by the contents of the king's last will. The wording is conditional on the will being signed by the king's hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Joseph Robson Tanner|title=Tudor Constitutional Documents, 1485–1603 |year=1951 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=398–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of the "dry stamp" signature was brought up in the context of Anglo-Scottish diplomacy, carried out by [[Robert Melville, 1st Lord Melville|Robert Melville]] on behalf of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], in 1567. Since the provisions of the will disadvantaged all the claimants of the [[House of Stuart]], the point remained important.&lt;ref name="Guy2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Guy|title=Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfBeZRjkovQC&amp;pg=PA267|year=2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-618-61917-8|pages=267–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Wing Loring''' (December 4, 1818 &amp;ndash; December 30, 1886) was an American soldier who served in the armies of the [[United States Army|United States]], the [[Confederate States Army|Confederacy]], and [[Egyptian Army|Egypt]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
William was born in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], to Reuben and Hannah Loring. He was a fifth great grandson of New England pioneer Deacon [[Thomas Loring]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Henry Pope, [https://archive.org/stream/loringgenealogy00pope#page/228/mode/2up "Loring Genealogy"], 1917, p.228&lt;/ref&gt; When he was four, his family moved to [[Saint Augustine, Florida]], where, at the young age of fourteen, he began a military career that spanned fifty years. As a fourteen-year-old, Loring joined the Florida Militia and gained his first combat experience fighting the [[Seminole Indians]] in minor skirmishes that would culminate in the [[Seminole Wars]]. When he was seventeen, he ran away to fight in the [[Texas Revolution|Texas War for Independence]], but was soon retrieved by his father and taken home. For the next few years he would fight in the [[second Seminole War]] and end up being promoted to [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]]. In 1837, Loring was sent to Alexandria Boarding School in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], completing his secondary education. He attended [[Georgetown University]] from 1839 to 1840 and then went on to study law, and was admitted to the Florida [[bar association|bar]] in 1842. In 1843, he was elected to the [[Florida House of Representatives]] where he served from 1843 to 1845. In 1845 he ran unsuccessfully for the [[Florida Senate]].

===Mexican-American War===
In 1846, Loring joined a newly formed regiment, the [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|Regiment of Mounted Rifles]], originally created to protect the [[Oregon Territory]]. He was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] even before the regiment saw battle. Shortly thereafter the Mounted Rifles were sent to [[Mexico]] to fight in the [[Mexican-American war]]. Loring's regiment saw action in most of the battles of the war and he was wounded three times. While leading the charge into [[Mexico City]], Loring's arm was shattered by a Mexican bullet, and he would later have it amputated. He received two [[brevet (military)|brevets]] for bravery, one to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], and another to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]].

===Antebellum years===
In 1849, during the [[California gold rush]], Loring was ordered to take command of the Oregon Territory and led a train of 600 mule teams 2,500 miles from Missouri to Oregon. He was in command of the Oregon Territory for two years and was then transferred to being commander of the forts of the frontier, such forts as Fort Ewell, Fort McIntosh, and Fort Union. During some five years he engaged in many skirmishes with the Indians, most notably with the [[Comanches]], [[Apaches]], and [[Kiowas]]. Loring was promoted to colonel at the age of 38 in December 1856, the youngest in the army.

He left the United States and traveled to [[Europe]] in May 1859. While there, he, like many of his fellow American officers, studied the military tactics that had been invented in the recent [[Crimean War]]. Before he returned home, Loring would visit [[Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Sweden]], [[Prussia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], and [[Egypt]].

===Civil War===
When the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] erupted, Loring sided with the South. In a conference in [[New Mexico]], just before he left to defend his homeland, Loring told his officers, "The South is my home, and I am going to throw up my commission and shall join the Southern Army, and each of you can do as you think best." He resigned from the U.S. Army on May 13, 1861. Upon offering his services to the Confederacy, Loring was promptly commissioned a [[General officers in the Confederate States Army|brigadier general]] and given command of the [[Army of the Northwest (Confederate)|Army of the Northwest]], participating in the Western Virginia Campaign in the fall of 1861. His first assignment was to quickly collect and rally the shattered remnants of [[Robert S. Garnett]]'s force following its defeat at the [[Battle of Rich Mountain]], and drill them in preparation for the defense of western [[Virginia]] against [[Major General#United States|Maj. Gen.]] [[George B. McClellan]]'s invasion from [[Ohio]]. 

After organizing an army of roughly 11,700 at [[Monterey, Virginia]], Loring detached two brigades under [[Henry R. Jackson]] and [[William B. Taliaferro]] to the north, to fortify Frank Mountain, and defend the approach from [[Cheat Mountain]].  Loring moved the rest of his army, the brigades of [[Samuel Read Anderson|S.R. Anderson]], [[Daniel S. Donelson]], and [[William Gilham]], south to [[Huntersville, West Virginia|Huntersville]].  Four days after his arrival at Huntersville, Loring was joined by colonel [[Robert E. Lee]], who had been sent by Richmond to western Virgina with the diplomatic role of inspecting and consulting. Loring, a Mexican War veteran who outranked Lee at the time, saw Lee as Richmond's attempt to look over his shoulder, and grew resentful of his presence. Loring and Lee moved the southern portion of their army to Valley Mountain, near [[Mace, West Virginia|Mace]], and down the [[Tygart Valley]] to the [[Battle of Cheat Mountain]] in September 1861. Loring soon acquired the nickname, "Old Blizzards" for his battle cry, "Give them blizzards, boys! Give them blizzards!"  Following that debacle, they moved south into [[Greenbrier County, West Virginia|Greenbrier County]] to reenforce the troops of the Kanawha Division under former Virginia governors [[John B. Floyd]] and [[Henry Alexander Wise]], then-at [[Sewell Mountain]] and [[Meadow Bluff, West Virginia|Meadow Bluff]].  Lee was re-called back to Richmond in late October. Loring and the men remained for a short period before abandoning the mountainous region too, marching into, and down the [[Shenandoah Valley]] to join [[Stonewall Jackson]] at [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]].

Loring famously butted heads with superior officers, particularly with [[Stonewall Jackson]].  At the conclusion of the  [[Romney Expedition]] in northwestern Virginia (now [[West Virginia]]) in January 1862, Jackson returned to his headquarters in Winchester while assigning Loring to stay and occupy the small, mountainous town. Unhappy with their assignment of holding a remote outpost in the dead of winter, Loring and his officers went over Jackson's head to [[Confederate States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Judah P. Benjamin]], requesting that the division be withdrawn. Jackson complied with the order, then resigned in protest of Richmond's interference with his command; he withdrew his resignation under pressure from Governor [[John Letcher]] and his former commander, [[Joseph E. Johnston]], and Loring was reassigned out of Jackson's command, and given command of the Department of Southwestern Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia. Governor (1860-1863: Letcher). Executive Papers, 1859-1863. Accession 36787. State government records collection, The Library of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his five months in that role, Loring moved a force of 5,000 into the [[Kanawha Valley]], ultimately occupying [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]] for a six week period.  In mid-October, Loring was transferred to the West.

By November 1862, Loring was in [[Grenada, Mississippi]], commanding a division in [[John C. Pemberton]]'s Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, another superior officer he had friction with.  In early spring of 1863, he defended against the [[Yazoo Pass Expedition]], before his division was ordered south to re-enforce Vicksburg.  He was present at Pemberton's disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Champion Hill|Champion Hill]]. Cut off from the rest of the army, most of his division then marched east to [[Jackson, Mississippi]] to join forces with [[General (United States)|Gen.]] [[Joseph E. Johnston]] for the impending [[Siege of Jackson|siege]]. By the end of 1863, he was under the command of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Leonidas Polk]] and defended east Mississippi from [[William T. Sherman]] during the [[Meridian Campaign]] of February 1864.  Polk's relatively small force was then ordered to northwest Georgia to join Joe Johnston's Army of Tennessee, which was beginning to abandon its winter quarters in [[Dalton, Georgia]] to start the [[Atlanta Campaign]].  Polk's divisions, one commanded by Loring, arrived just in time to temporarily thwart a flanking maneuver by Union General [[James B. McPherson]] at the [[Battle of Resaca]]. Facing overwhelming numbers, Johnston's army was continuously flanked and forced to withdraw closer and closer to Atlanta.

Loring temporarily took command of Polk's III corps when Polk was nearly cut in two by an artillery round and killed at [[Pine Mountain (Cobb County, Georgia)|Pine Mountain]] on June 14, 1864.  He led the corps during the [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain]] but was soon replaced on July 7, 1864 by Lt. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]. Loring returned to divisional command, fighting at the [[Battle of Peachtree Creek]], and at [[Battle of Ezra Church|Ezra Church]], where he was wounded.  Loring was out of action until after the fall of [[Battle of Atlanta|Atlanta]]. Upon returning he commanded his division in Stewart's corp of army now commanded by [[John Bell Hood]], seeing combat at the [[Battle of Franklin II|Franklin]] on November 30, 1864, and [[Battle of Nashville|Nashville]] in mid-December. In the last year of the war, the remnants of Hood's smashed forces returned east to participate in the [[Carolinas Campaign]], seeing action at the [[Battle of Bentonville]] before being surrendered by Johnston at [[Durham, North Carolina]] a month later.

===Egypt===
[[File:William W. Loring as Pasha.jpg|thumb|Loring Pasha as a general in the [[Khedivate of Egypt]]]]
After the Confederate defeat in the Civil War, Loring served for nine years in the army of [[Isma'il Pasha]], the [[Khedive]] of Egypt. He joined about fifty Union and Confederate veterans who had been recommended to the Khedive by [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]. Loring began as Inspector General of the army, a position in which he suggested various ways to modernize the army. He was then placed in charge of the country’s coastal defenses, where he oversaw the erection of numerous fortifications. In 1875, he was promised the command of an Egyptian invasion of [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]], however [[Muhammad Ratib Pasha|Ratib Pasha]] was given the assignment instead, and Loring was named chief of staff. Ratib Pasha was the ex-slave of the late Said Pawshar, the viceroy of Egypt, with negligible military qualifications; according to one of Loring's American compatriots, the freedman was "shrivelled with lechery as the mummy is with age."&lt;ref&gt;Czeslaw Jesman, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/718057 "Egyptian Invasion of Ethiopia", ''African Affairs''], 58 (1959), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Egyptian-Ethiopian War]] ended in disaster at the [[Battle of Gura]], and the Egyptians blamed the Americans for the disaster. When Ratib Pasha had urged remaining with the [[Gura, Eritrea|Gura]] fortress, Loring had taunted him and called him a coward until he consented to meeting the Ethiopian host in the open valley.&lt;ref&gt;Boulger, Demetrius. ''The Life of Gordon'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=MPKHS1ntwZIC&amp;pg=PT230 pp.&amp;nbsp;230&amp;nbsp;ff.] T.&amp;nbsp;Fisher Unwin (London), 1896 reprinted Library of Alexandria, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; While the rest of the Egyptian army returned home, they were ordered to remain in [[Massawa]] until further notice, where they endured the summer months, then spent the next two years enduring endless frustration and humiliation in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;Jesman, "Egyptian Invasion", p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, partially due to finances, the American officers were dismissed. During his service to Egypt, Loring attained the rank of Fereek Pasha (Major General). After his return to the United States, he wrote a book about his Egyptian experiences, entitled ''A Confederate Soldier in Egypt'' (1884). Loring was also the posthumous co-author of ''The March of the Mounted Riflemen'' (1940).&lt;ref name=Eicher&gt;Eicher, pp. 353-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to United States===
Loring returned to Florida where he unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate against [[Charles W. Jones]]. He then moved to [[New York City]], where he died. He is buried in Loring Park, behind Government House in downtown [[St. Augustine, Florida]]--where his presence was protested in 2018 by a group opposing Confederate memorials on public property.&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt;

'''Yaron Svoray''' is an [[Israel]]i former police detective, author, and lecturer, most notable for his work against Neo-Nazis. Svoray infiltrated German Neo-Nazi groups, contributed to the arrest of Nazi war criminal [[Erich Priebke]], and has also been active in searching for treasure looted by the Nazis.
==Biography==
Yaron Svoray was born in Israel. His father, Yehuda Soberski, born in [[Germany]], [[aliyah|immigrated]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]] with his family in 1938. The rest of the Soberski family perished in the Holocaust. His mother, Rachel Stern, was born in [[Egypt]] and moved with her family to [[Romania]] when she was a child. Most of her relatives died in the Holocaust and she fled to Mandate Palestine with some of her family in 1943. 

Svoray served in the [[Paratroopers Brigade]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]], and later worked as a detective in the Israeli Central Police Command.

He traveled to the USA where he earned his bachelor's and master's degree in media and communication, and worked as a journalist and a lecturer.
==Intelligence career==
In the early 1990s, he went undercover inside the German Neo Nazi organization. He convinced them that he was an Australian neo-Nazi named Ron Furey who wanted to join the German Neo Nazis. Svoray's investigation brought him into contact with key neo-Nazi leaders. Furthermore, there was evidence that the German groups had managed to forge links with similar groups in [[South America]] and the [[United States]]. Svoray's book ''In Hitler’s Shadow'' was later adapted into a 1995 [[HBO]] special, ''[[The Infiltrator (1995 film)|The Infiltrator]]'', starring [[Oliver Platt]] as Svoray.

While working undercover Svoray discovered that a Nazi war criminal [[Erich Priebke]] who participating in the massacre at the Ardeatine caves in Rome escaped to South America and lived there under an assumed name. The intelligence he gathered facilitated the capture and arrest of Priebke.

In 2007, Svoray found the dumping ground for the destroyed remains of Jewish property plundered during [[Kristallnacht]]. The dump, situated in a forest in Brandenburg, is the size of several football fields and  thought to contain an extensive range of personal and ceremonial items, although only a small number of items have been dug up.

In 2013 Svoray and his team began a search for boxes full of gold dumped into the [[Stolpsee]] lake in Germany. This project is being filmed by ''National Geographic''.

==Published works==
To the general public Svoray is probably best known for his hunt of Nazi era [[diamond]]s. Svoray’s search was documented on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]’s special ''Blood from a Stone'', which was based on the book, ''Blood from a Stone'', written by Yaron Svoray and published by the Tor Books division of St. Martin’s Press.

Svoray's next book was ''Gods of Death'', published in 1997 by Simon &amp; Schuster. The book is an account of Svoray's hunt for the source of and sense behind the [[snuff film]] which he witnessed while undercover inside the Neo Nazi movement. This time Svoray presented himself as a middleman first for buyers and then for dealers of snuff films, trying to fake his way into the highly secretive industry, at several points running foul of the Russian mob in Israel and various criminal organizations in the US and Southeast Asia.
