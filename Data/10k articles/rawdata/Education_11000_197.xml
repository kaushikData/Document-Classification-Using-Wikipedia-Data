      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6985">'''Advanced Level (A-Level) Mathematics''' is a qualification of [[further education]] taken in the [[United Kingdom]] and occasionally in other countries as well. In the UK [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A-Level]] exams are traditionally taken by 17-18 year-olds after a two-year course at a [[sixth form]] or [[college]]. [[Further Mathematics|Advanced Level Further Mathematics]] is often taken by students who wish to study a mathematics based degree at university.
 
Like other A-level subjects, mathematics has been assessed in a modular system since the introduction of [[Curriculum 2000]], whereby each candidate must take six modules, with the best achieved score in each of these modules (after any retakes) contributing to the final grade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cife.org.uk/FAQs-about-A-level-retakes.html&lt;/ref&gt; Most students will complete three modules in one year, which will create an AS-level qualification in their own right and will complete the A-level course the following year with three more modules.

The system in which mathematics is assessed is changing for students starting courses in 2017 (part of the A-level reforms first introduced in 2015), where the reformed specifications have reverted to a linear structure with exams only taken at the end of the course in a single sitting. In addition, whereas in the older modular specification schools could choose freely between taking Statistics, Mechanics or Discrete Mathematics (also known as Decision Mathematics) modules with the ability to specialise in one branch of applied Mathematics, the new specifications make both Mechanics and Statistics compulsory, with Discrete Mathematics being made exclusive as an option to students pursuing a Further Mathematics course. The first assessment opportunity for the new specification is 2018 and 2019 for A-levels in Mathematics and Further Mathematics respectively.

==Overview==
The basic A-Level course consists of six modules, four standard (C1, C2, C3, and C4) and two modules that can be chosen by the student or school/college, etc. The C1 through C4 modules are referred to by A-level textbooks as "Core" modules, encompassing the major topics of mathematics such as logarithms, differentiation/integration and geometric/arithmetic progressions. 

The two chosen modules for the final two parts of the A-Level are determined either by a student's personal choices or the course choice of their school/college, but commonly take the form of S1 (Statistics) and M1 (Mechanics)

===Further mathematics===

{{main article|Further Mathematics}}

Some mathematics students will choose to take an A-level in Further Mathematics which requires taking a further 6 modules to give a second qualification. The grades of the two A-levels will be independent of each other. Further Mathematics requires students to take a minimum of two Further Pure modules, one of which must be FP1, and the other either FP2 or FP3,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edexcel.com/migrationdocuments/GCE%20New%20GCE/UA024850%20GCE%20in%20Mathematics%20issue%202%20180510.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which are simply extensions of the four Core modules from the normal Maths A-Level. Four more modules need to be taken; those available vary with different specifications.

Not all schools are able to offer Further Mathematics, due to low student numbers meaning the course is not financially viable, or due to a lack of suitably experienced teachers. To fulfil the demand extra tutoring is available, with providers such as the Further Mathematics Support Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supporting and Promoting Advanced and Further Mathematics|url=http://www.fmnetwork.org.uk/supporting_maths.php|publisher=The Further Mathematics Support Programme|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some students can also take a third maths qualification, "Additional Further Mathematics", which adds more modules from those not used for Mathematics or Further Mathematics. Schools that offer this qualification usually only take this to AS-level, taking three modules, but some students can go further, taking the extra six modules to gain another full A-Level qualification. Additional Further Mathematics is offered by Edexcel only. Lastly, a Pure Mathematics A-level is available for those students who (on the Edexcel exam board) take the modules C1, C2, C3, C4, FP1 and either FP2 or FP3.

==Results and statistics==
Each module carries a maximum of 100 UMS points towards the total grade and each module is also given a separate grade depending on its score. The number of points required for different grades are defined below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Grade
! Module (Out of 100)
! AS level (Out of 300)
! A level (Out of 600)

==Criticisms==

It has been suggested by The Department for Education that the high proportion of candidates who obtain grade A makes it difficult for universities to distinguish between the most able candidates. The 2010 exam session has introduced an A* grade that distinguishes between better candidates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cie.org.uk/news/features/detail?feature_id=31480&lt;/ref&gt;

The A* grade in maths is awarded to candidates who achieve an A (480/600) in their overall A Level as well as achieving a combined score of 180/200 in modules Core 3 and Core 4.

The A* grade in further maths is awarded slightly differently. The same minimum score of 480/600 is required across all six modules, however a 90% average (or a score of 270/300) must be obtained across the candidate's best 'A2' modules. A2 modules include any modules other than those with a '1' (FP1, S1, M1 and D1 are not A2 modules, whereas FP2, FP3, FP4 (from AQA only), S2, S3, S4, M2, M3 and D2 are).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edexcel.com/migrationdocuments/GCE%20New%20GCE/UA024850%20GCE%20in%20Mathematics%20issue%202%20180510.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Airline Tycoon''''' is a [[business simulation game]] by Thomas Holz and Robert Kleinert, in which the player must successfully manage an airline. The original was developed by [[Spellbound Entertainment|Spellbound]], and published by [[Infogrames]], however, the succeeding versions were published by a variety of publishers. The original ''Airline Tycoon'' was created for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], however, the later ''Deluxe'' version was also [[porting|ported]] to [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[MorphOS]], [[Magnussoft ZETA|ZETA]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. In this game, like all Tycoon computer games, the objective is to become a tycoon, and in this case, an “Airline Tycoon.” This is achieved through the balance of income and expenditures.

== Gameplay==
A simulation computer game where the player acts as manager of an airline, competing against three other tycoons. The names of the four tycoons are: Tina Cortez (Sunshine Airways), Siggi Sorglos (Falcon Lines), Igor Tuppolevsky (Phoenix Travel) and Mario Zucchero (Honey Airlines). The player must keep their aircraft in good shape and equip them at such a level as to keep the customers satisfied, buy new planes (from the expensive Airplane Agency or from Mr Schlauberger at the museum who sells old planes at a much lower cost) and take out bank loans if required.
The player must also manage their personnel, plan flights, buy fuel, attend meetings in the airport manager's office and, if there is the time, slip into Rick's café for a quick cup of coffee. The player can also perform sabotages on the other players. The graphics are bright and decidedly tongue in cheek: the tycoon Igor Tuppolevsky has a set of Russian dolls on his desk—and an open tin of caviar, while Tina Cortez has a picture of a matador and a bull's head.

With a network, up to four people can play at once and the game status can be saved (as it can in single-player mode) for longer games.

=== Releases ===
The original game was released in August 1998 in [[Germany]]. It was not released in any English-speaking country; however, there was an official English [[Game demo|demo]].&lt;br /&gt;
The first Airline Tycoon title to be released in [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] was ''Airline Tycoon First Class''. It was published in 2001 by [[Monte Cristo (company)|Monte Cristo]]; however, the publisher decided to remove ''First Class'' subtitle from the game box and [[Instruction manual (computer and video games)|manuals]], though it remained in-game. Features added in First Class include ten brand new missions, [[Multiplayer game|multiplayer]] mode with up to 4 players, new [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] music, [[cargo]] transportation and more.&lt;br /&gt;
In 2002, ''Airline Tycoon Evolution'', second Airline Tycoon re-release was published by [[Monte Cristo (company)|Monte Cristo]]. The game introduced ten new missions, possibility of buying self-designed aircraft (and possibility of sharing these planes via [[Internet]]), possibility of hiring aircraft security agents, five new [[sabotage]]s and more.

In 2003, [[Spellbound Entertainment|Spellbound]] released a third Airline Tycoon addition, named ''Airline Tycoon Deluxe''. It included all of previous versions, the only new part of the game was twenty new airports and possibility of accepting cargo from remote estates. Originally it was released in [[special edition|limited edition]] of 5000 items. It was available only in [[Germany]], though it was not translated into other languages. However, Linux, Mac OS X and ZETA versions released in Autumn 2005 and Winter 2006 by [[RuneSoft]] are available in [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rune-soft.com/Games/Released/Game-239/game=Airline_Tycoon_Deluxe-6 Airline_Tycoon_Deluxe] on rune-soft.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March, 2015 Airline Tycoon Deluxe was re-released on the [[digital distribution]] platform [[gog.com]], including the [[source code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gog.com/news/release_bairline_tycoon_deluxeb|title=Release: Airline Tycoon Deluxe |date=2015-03-24 |accessdate=2015-08-01 |quote=''Airline Tycoon Deluxe is a golden oldie with native versions for Mac OS X and Linux. As an added bonus, the package here comes with the game's Windows source code for your viewing and tweaking pleasure. You sure don't see that every day.'' |publisher=[[gog.com]] |author=gog.com team}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Successor Airline Tycoon 2 ===
{{Distinguish|Air Tycoon 2}}
On May 24, 2006 Spellbound announced it would be releasing a full sequel to Airline Tycoon, Airline Tycoon II due to be released in Germany sometime in the second half of 2007. The release date was, however, not met. Spellbound stated they could not find a publisher for the game and announced no new release date. On October 22, 2009 Airline Tycoon II was announced by [[Kalypso Media]] and scheduled to be released in late 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/airline-tycoon-ii-spellbound-s-plane-accumulating-sim-to-be-published-worldwide-by-kalypso|title=Airline Tycoon II Announced|date=October 22, 2009 |publisher=[[Games Industry]]|accessdate=2009-10-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091029140525/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/airline-tycoon-ii-spellbound-s-plane-accumulating-sim-to-be-published-worldwide-by-kalypso| archivedate= 29 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was scheduled to be released in the United States On October 2, 2011 by [[Amazon.com]], however, [[Kalypso Media]] scheduled their North American release for October 14, 2011. The Game as of date has been released and includes a demo version which the original lacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airline-tycoon2.com/us/index.php |title=Airline Tycoon II Official Website |date=October 13, 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first extra content or expansion for the game was announced on March 29, 2012. '''''Honey Airlines DLC''''' finally became available on April 19 of the same year. It would feature a new character, new airline company, two additional campaign missions and a Cargo area for the airport. The second one, announced on May 31, 2012 called '''''Falcon Lines DLC''''' was eventually released on June 14 of that year. This DLC would add another character and airline company, another two additional campaign missions, the Last-Minute Counter as a new airport area and the ability to open branch offices anywhere throughout the world.

== Reception ==
Sales of ''Airline Tycoon'' surpassed 150,000 units worldwide by 2001.&lt;ref name=pczonepreview&gt;{{cite journal| title=This town ain't big enough... ''Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive'' | author=Pullin, Keith | journal=[[PC Zone]] | date=January 2001 | issue=98 | page=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 an [[IGN]] review gave Airline Tycoon a good rating with 7.9/10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/02/21/airline-tycoon IGN Airline Tycoon Reviewon PC] on [[IGN.com]] (20 Feb 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Airline Tycoon 2 received on [[Metacritic]] a mediocre score of 57/100 from four reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/airline-tycoon-2 airline-tycoon-2] on [[Metacritic]] &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aksel Mikkelsen''' (14 August 1849 in [[Hjørring]] &amp;ndash; 19 October 1929 in [[Korsør]]) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[educator]] who introduced the [[Sweden|Swedish]] system of [[sloyd]] schools into Denmark, and organized schools and seminaries on the system, which teaches manual training as an aid in developing the pupils physically and mentally as well as affording a basis of technical training. Beginning in 1907, he was inspector of the sloyd system in Denmark. He wrote books as well.{{sfn|Rines|1920}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9825">'''Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing''' (formerly the Admissions Testing Service) supports educational institutions, professional organisations, governments and employers in the selection and recruitment of applicants, by providing [[admission test|admissions tests]] for medicine and healthcare, assessments in thinking skills and behavioural styles, and subject-specific admissions tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissionstesting.org/images/164648-guide-for-educational-institutions-and-policy-makers.pdf |title=Information for educational institutions |publisher=Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing |date= |accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is part of [[University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate|Cambridge Assessment]], a not-for-profit department of the [[University of Cambridge]], [[England]].

==History==
The [[Thinking Skills Assessment]] (TSA) was introduced in 2001 for entry to a range of undergraduate courses at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissionstesting.org/our-services/thinking-skills/tsa-cambridge/about-tsa-cambridge/ |title=About TSA Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing |date= |accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a dedicated unit was formally set up within [[Cambridge Assessment]], with responsibility for developing and administering admissions tests. The Thinking Skills Admissions Testing (TSAT) unit was responsible for administering the [[Thinking Skills Assessment]] (TSA) and the first [[BioMedical Admissions Test]] (BMAT), which had been introduced in 2003.

In 2004, interest in fair admissions to higher education was fuelled by the Schwartz Report. This led to a collaboration between TSAT and the [[Australian Council for Educational Research]] (ACER) and the development of uniTEST. uniTEST explored whether a single test could be used for admission to a broad range of courses and higher education institutions. uniTEST was introduced by some Australian universities, but there was relatively little demand in the UK.

Other projects followed, including work with the Faculty of English at the [[University of Oxford]] to develop an admissions test for undergraduate courses in English. Following a successful trial in autumn 2006, the [[English Literature Admissions Test]] (ELAT) was introduced in the 2007–08 admissions cycle.

In recent years there has been more work with the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge to administer their own admissions tests/pre-interview assessments. This has included:
* From 2011 onwards, administering the University of Oxford tests – starting with the History Aptitude Test (HAT) and the Physics Aptitude Test (PAT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/PAT%20FAQs%20v2%20May%202011_0.pdf |title=In partnership with Cambridge Assessment |publisher=University of Oxford |date= |accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From 2016 onwards, assisting with the development and delivery of the University of Cambridge pre-interview assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissionstesting.org/news/view/working-with-the-university-of-cambridge-on-pre-interview-assessments/ |title=Working with the University of Cambridge on pre-interview assessments |publisher=Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing |date= |accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After becoming the Admissions Testing Service in 2011, the name changed to Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing in January 2017, making clear it is part of [[University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate|Cambridge Assessment]], a not-for-profit department of the [[University of Cambridge]].

==Admissions tests for medicine and healthcare==

===[[BioMedical Admissions Test]] (BMAT)===
[[BioMedical Admissions Test|BMAT]] is used by universities in the UK and overseas for entry to Medicine, Biomedical Science and Dentistry courses. 

===[[International Medical Admissions Test]] (IMAT)===

===[[Sixth Term Examination Paper]] (STEP)===
[[Sixth Term Examination Paper|STEP]] is used for entry to [[Mathematics]] courses at the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[University of Warwick]]. It is used by the University of Cambridge as the basis for conditional offers, and is taken in June for admission in October. Other UK universities may take STEP results into account when making offers for their Mathematics courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissionstesting.org/our-services/subject-specific/step/about-step/ |title=About STEP |publisher=Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing |date= |accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test of Mathematics for University Admission===
The Test of Mathematics for University Admission is a 2-hour 30-minute test of mathematical thinking and reasoning. [[Durham University]], [[Lancaster University]], the [[University of Warwick]], [[the University of Sheffield]] and [[the University of Southampton]] encourage applicants to their Mathematics courses to take the test.

It is also used by [[Stockholm School of Economics]], [[Sweden]] and [[Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS]] (UTP), [[Malaysia]]. 

==Behavioural styles assessment==

=== Cambridge Personal Styles Questionnaire (CPSQ) ===
CPSQ is designed to assess behavioural styles, specifically focusing on how people approach tasks and interact with others. This includes key areas such as thinking and learning, motivation, self-management, resilience and interpersonal values and attitudes. CPSQ has been specifically created for use within two areas: healthcare education and employment, higher education and schools. The assessment was developed over four years of research and trialling with general and vocational higher education (including medicine, nursing and healthcare institutions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissionstesting.org/our-services/behavioural-styles-assessment/ |title=Behavioural styles assessment (CPSQ) |publisher=Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing |date= |accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing conducts a broad programme of research to ensure the fairness and validity of its admissions tests for university admissions. The key aim of the research activity is to gather evidence to demonstrate that the admissions tests make a useful contribution to the admissions process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissionstesting.org/for-institutions/research/ |title=Research |publisher=Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing |date= |accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Rhodes Scholars Foundation''' (CRSF) is an award-granting body, governed by a board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Rhodes Scholars Foundation Scholarship [http://www.crsfoundation.ca/Default.aspx?base], http://www.crsfoundation.ca/Default.aspx?base {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122170021/http://www.crsfoundation.ca/Default.aspx?base# |date=2010-11-22 }}. Retrieved 27 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It awards up to three scholarships per year to graduates of the [[University of Oxford]] in [[Oxford, England]] to pursue graduate study at any Canadian university.

==History==
Founded by Rhodes Scholars, including [[Roland Michener]] and E. Michael Howarth &lt;ref&gt;Oxford honours friends from across the world [http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/friends_honoured.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107073808/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/friends_honoured.html# |date=2014-01-07 }}, http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/friends_honoured.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107073808/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/friends_honoured.html# |date=2014-01-07 }}. Retrieved 27 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the Canadian Rhodes Scholars Foundation was founded in 1957, in recognition of the contribution of the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] on the lives and careers of its members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxford-canada.org/about/historical-notes.html] http://oxford-canada.org/about/historical-notes.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is a distinct entity from the Canadian Association of Rhodes Scholars [http://www.canadian-rhodes-scholars.ca/], with whom it shares close associations.

Although initially "the announcement of a scholarship to Canada fell somewhat short of causing an overnight sensation in Oxford" &lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxford-canada.org/about/historical-notes.html |title=History |publisher=Crsfoundation.ca |date=2006-06-30 |accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Canadian Rhodes Scholars Foundation has grown to be a respected and prestigious institution, supported by a number of high-profile Canadian Rhodes Scholars and former recipients. There are over 100&lt;ref&gt; Oxford-Canada.org (Scholars)&lt;/ref&gt; students who have benefited from the award since its inception.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/friends_honoured.html |title=Oxford honours friends from across the world - University of Oxford |publisher=Ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107073808/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/friends_honoured.html# |archive-date=2014-01-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
The Oxford-Canada Scholarship is modelled on the Rhodes Scholarship. It provides for up to two years of full tuition and associated fees, along with an annual stipend of CDN$16,000.&lt;ref name="Rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxford-canada.org/index.html |title=Oxford-Canada Scholarship |publisher=oxford-canada.org/ |date=2010-11-19 |accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scholarship also provides a CAD 1000, travel grant toward the cost of transatlantic travel and a further CAD 1,000, for travel within Canada&lt;ref&gt;oxford-canada.org(Apply)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Short-listed candidates are invited to interview at [[Rhodes House]], after which selection is made. The Oxford-Canada Scholarship is awarded for a maximum of two years and is eligible only to graduates of Oxford.

In 1958, [[Jack Isadore Cole (businessman)|Jack Cole]] and [[Carl Cole]], founders of [[Coles (bookstore)|Coles]], sold the U.S. rights to Coles Notes to [[Cliff Hillegass]] who then published the books under [[CliffsNotes]].

By 1960, Coles notes sales had peaked. They had published over 120 titles, mostly on English novels; however, they also covered other subjects including math, science, and foreign languages. Coles Notes is currently owned by [[Indigo Books and Music|Indigo Books]] in Canada.

__NOTOC__

==''The Windsome Tree: a ghost story''==
''The Windsome Tree: a ghost story'' is Albrizio's debut novel. Description: '''There are ghosts in the tree who would kill to get home!''' Unable to crawl out of her grief after losing her youngest child to leukemia, Mercy Amoretto, mother of four, takes her therapist's advice and starts to clean out the clutter in her life. In the garage, she finds an old tire and rope and, in a fanciful moment, creates a tire swing. Unknown to her, the rope, the tire, and the tree share a violent history. Once they are connected, that history is unleashed in the form of two child spirits from decades past. While on the swing, Mercy begins hearing cryptic messages from the spirits and is quick to believe the voices are key to finding her dead daughter. Hope turns to horror when two of her children appear to taunt her in tortuous ways. And when her children go missing, all eyes turn to Mercy. She's convinced the ghosts are to blame, but how can anyone believe her when she's the only one who hears their voices? 

==''The Box Under the Bed''==
''The Box Under the Bed'' is a collection of haunting tales and tidbits pulled from under the bed. These compelling little poems and stories explore the dark side of the human psyche and the ghostly side of life. Winner of the 2015 Paranormal Poetry and Prose Prize.

==''Messy on the Inside''==
''Messy on the Inside'' was published in 1998. Albrizio's first book of poetry, it consists of 60 poems written entirely in formal verse. Utilizing such traditional forms as  the English [[sonnet]], [[pantoum]], [[villanelle]], [[sestina]] and [[haiku]], this book spotlights Albrizio's ability to master form without losing the poem's accessibility. From the success of this book, Albrizio created an acclaimed formal verse workshop.

==''Rain - Dark as Water in Winter''==
''Rain – Dark as Water in Winter'' was published in 2001. This book consists of a one-act play written in verse and 30 poems written in traditional forms. The play, ''Rain'', was honored by the ''Writer’s Digest''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writersdigest.com ''Writer’s Digest'']&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the best written one-act plays of 1997. The two-character play focuses on the cycle of an emotionally abusive relationship between Rain and her lover, Perfidy. The play has a profound iambic rhythm, while the rhyme, although consistently placed, is only subtly heard.

==''Perennials: New &amp; Selected Poems''==
''Perennials: New &amp; Selected Poems'' marks Albrizio’s break from traditional forms. It was published in 2007. Although it includes some of her most well received poems from her previous two books, it also consists of over 30 new poems that are largely written in [[free verse]] or in forms of her own creation. She continues to teach poetry workshops, but has since added a segment on applying the [[rhetorical devices]] used in formal verse to free-verse writing. The Greater Hartford Arts Council and the New Boston Fund have honored with excellence several free-verse poems that were later included in the first chapter of this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1538">The '''Greenwell Matongo Community Library''' is situated in the [[Greenwell Matongo (neighborhood)|Greenwell Matongo area]] of [[Katutura]], a [[township (South Africa)|township]] of [[Windhoek]], [[Namibia]]. The name derives from a freedom fighter [[Greenwell Matongo]] who fought for the liberation of Namibia.

The City of [[Windhoek]] in partnership with the Ministry of Education and City of [[Vantaa]], [[Finland]] came up with an initiative, to help the community through educational services. Therefore, a Community Library was established in March 2005, with the aim of providing library and information services for the community. 

Besides the traditional services that are being provided by a library (borrowing and lending books), Greenwell Matongo Library gives also services such as a free internet access, photocopying and faxing of documents, scanning and laminating. Free computer training and workshops on craft for the community at large are also offered.

The '''Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)''' is an annual conference for [[Information Systems]] and [[Information Technology]] academics and professionals sponsored by the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]]. Along with [[International Conference on Information Systems| ICIS]], HICSS is widely considered to be one of the prestigious international conferences for IS/IT in the world.{{citation needed|reason=This claim sounds like PR and has no place in a Wikipedia article unless backed by serious, reliable sources.|date=July 2016}} The conference, which now draws over 1,000 participants every year, provides a platform for panel discussions and the presentation of [[peer-reviewed]] information systems research papers. Papers selected for presentation appear in the ''HICSS Proceedings'' published by IEEE, which have grown to add nearly 6,000 additional pages of refereed material annually. In addition, the Symposia, Workshops, and Tutorials held on the first day are a program component that specifically contributes to the quality of the conference. 

The first HICSS conference, which took place in 1968 at the [[University of Hawaii]], attracted representatives from 11 countries. Since that time, HICSS has grown markedly, and now attracts registered delegates from over four dozen countries every year. The conference is currently sponsored by the [[Shidler College of Business]] at the University of Hawai{{okina}}i-Manoa.&lt;ref name="hicss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hicss.org/ |title=About HICSS |publisher=Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences |accessdate=January 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HICSS is the top IS conference in terms of citations as recorded by Google Scholar. The acceptance rate was less than 50% in 2015. Opportunities to fast track HICSS papers for journal publications are also available in some areas of research. Examples of journal publications that provide fast track opportunities to selected HICSS-50 papers include:
* Journal of Management Information Systems (JMIS)
* Journal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS)
* Communications of the ACM (CACM)
* MIS Quarterly Executive (MISQE)
* Group Decision and Negotiation (GDN)
* Journal of Information Technology Theory and Application (JITTA)
* Journal on Information Technology Enabled Collaboration for Development
* European Journal of Information Systems

Murphy, Foley Hoag LLP|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazing is seen in many different  types of social groups, including [[gang]]s, [[Team sport|sports teams]], schools, [[military unit]]s, and [[fraternities and sororities]]. The initiation rites can range from relatively benign pranks, to protracted patterns of behavior that rise to the level of abuse or criminal misconduct.&lt;ref name="foley"/&gt; Hazing is often prohibited by law or prohibited by institutions such as colleges and universities because it may include either [[physical abuse|physical]] or [[psychological abuse]]. It may also include nudity or sexual assault.

In some  languages, terms with a religious theme or etymology are preferred, such as [[baptism]] or [[purgatory]] (e.g. {{lang|fr|[[w:fr:Baptême (folklore étudiant)|baptême]]}} in Belgian French, {{lang|nl|doop}} in Belgian Dutch) or variations on a theme of [[naïve]]té and the [[rite of passage]] such as a derivation from a term for freshman, for example {{lang|fr|[[w:fr:bizutage|bizutage]]}} in French French, {{lang|nl|ontgroening}} (de-[[wikt:greenhorn|green[horn]]]ing) in Netherlandic Dutch and Afrikaans (South Africa and Namibia), {{lang|es|novatada}} in Spanish, from {{lang|es|novato}}, meaning newcomer or rookie or a combination of both, such as in the [[Finland|Finnish]] {{lang|fi|mopokaste}} (literally "moped baptism", "moped" being the nickname for newcomers, stemming from the concept that they would be forced to drive a child's bicycle or tricycle). In [[Latvia]]n, the word {{lang|lv|iesvētības}}, which literally means "in-blessings", is used, also standing for religious rites of passage, especially [[confirmation]]. In [[Sweden|Swedish]], the term used is {{lang|se|nollning}}, literally "zeroing" (from the fact that when you start your first year, you're a "one'er", but before passing the rite you are a "zero"). In Portugal, the term {{lang|pt|[[praxe]]}}, which literally means "practice" or "habit", is used for initiation. In Brazil, it is called {{lang|pt|trote}} and is usually practiced at universities by older students ({{lang|pt|doutores}} and {{lang|pt|veteranos}}) against newcomers ({{lang|pt|calouros}}) in the first week of their first semester. In the [[Italy|Italian]] military, instead, the term used was {{lang|it|nonnismo}}, from {{lang|it|nonno}} (literally "grandfather"), a jargon term used for the soldiers who had already served for most of their draft period. A similar equivalent term exists in the [[Russian military]], where a hazing phenomenon known as {{lang|ru|дедовщи́на}} {{lang|ru-Latn|[[dedovshchina]]}} exists, meaning roughly "grandfather" or the slang term "gramps" (referring to the senior corps of soldiers in their final year of [[conscription]]). At education establishments in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, this practice involves existing students baiting new students and is called [[ragging]]. In Polish schools, hazing is known as {{lang|pl|kocenie}} (literally ''catting'', coming from the noun {{lang|pl|kot}} cat). It often features cat-related activities, like competitive milk drinking. Other popular tasks include measuring a long distance (i.e. hallways) with matches.

Often most or all of the endurance or the more serious ordeal is concentrated in a single session, which may be called ''[[hell]] night'', or prolonged to a ''hell week'', sometimes again at the pledge's{{huh|date=April 2017}} birthday (e.g. by [[birthday spanking]]), but some traditions keep terrorizing pledges over a long period, resembling [[fagging]].

In Israel, the practice is called {{lang|he|זובור}} {{lang|he-Latn|zubur}} (an Arabic-derived Hebrew slang word roughly equivalent to 'willie') and exists primarily in [[Israeli Defense Force]] combat units and the Israel Air Force. Unlike hazing in many other places, {{lang|he-Latn|zubur}} is typically used to mark the achievement of important milestones (in an ironic 'don't get too big for your britches' way), such as after a pilot's first solo flight.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Methods ==

Hazing activities can involve forms of ridicule and humiliation within the group or in public, while other hazing incidents are akin to pranks. A [[snipe hunt]] is such a prank, when a newcomer or credulous person is given an impossible task. Examples of snipe hunts include being sent to find a "dough repair kit" in a bakery,&lt;ref&gt;Aman, Reinhold (1996). ''Maledicta'', Volume 12. Maledicta Press. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; while in the early 1900s rookies in the Canadian military were ordered to obtain a "brass magnet" when [[brass]] is not [[ferromagnetism|magnetic]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuEfAQAAMAAJ&amp;hl=en The Electrical Journal]''. Benn Bros. 1916. p. 51. Retrieved 27 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanking is done mainly in the form of [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]] among fraternities, sororities and similar clubs, sometimes over a lap, a knee, furniture or a pillow, but mostly with the victim "assuming the position", i.e., simply bending over forward.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} A variation of this (also as punishment) is [[trading licks]]. This practice is also used in the military.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Alternative modes (including bare-buttock paddling, strapping and switching, as well as mock forms of antiquated forms of [[physical punishment]]s such as [[stocks]], walking the plank and [[running the gauntlet]]) have been reported.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The hazee may be humiliated by being hosed or by sprinkler or buckets; covered with dirt or with (sometimes rotten) food, even urinated upon. Olive or [[Baby Oil|baby oil]] may be used to "show off" the bare skin, for wrestling or just slipperiness, e.g., to complicate pole climbing. Cleaning may be limited to a dive into water, hosing down or even paddling the worst off. They may have to do tedious cleaning including swabbing the decks or cleaning the toilets with a toothbrush. In fraternities, pledges often must clean up a mess intentionally made by brothers which can include fecal matter, urine, and dead animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giménez|first1=Mar|title=Descriptions|url=https://hazing.cornell.edu/cms/hazing/incidents/descriptions.cfm|website=Cornell University|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Servitude such as waiting on others (as at fraternity parties) or various other forms of housework, often with tests of obedience. In some cases, the hazee may be made to eat raw eggs, peppers, hot sauce, or drink too much alcohol. Some hazing even includes eating or drinking vile things such as bugs or rotting food.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The hazee may have to wear an imposed piece of clothing, outfit, item or something else worn by the victim in a way that would bring negative attention to the wearer. Examples include a uniform (e.g. [[toga]]); a leash or collar (also associated with [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]]); infantile and other humiliating dress and attire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rahman|first= Mohammed|work= SportsGrid|url=http://www.sportsgrid.com/media/high-school-cheerleaders-hazing-ritual-includes-wearing-diapers-getting-hit-with-hot-dogs/|title=High School Cheerleaders' Hazing Ritual Includes Wearing Diapers, Getting Hit With Hot Dogs|date=27 May 2011|accessdate= 27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/social_issues/july-dec12/hazing_09-21.html |title=For Perpetrators and Victims, Suppressing Temptation of College Hazing Rituals|newspaper=[[PBS]]|date= September 21, 2012|accessdate= 27 May 2013|first=Judy|last=Woodruff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Markings may also be made on clothing or bare skin. They are painted, written, tattooed or shaved on, sometimes collectively forming a message (one letter, syllable or word on each pledge) or may receive [[tarring and feathering]] (or rather a mock version using some glue) or [[Human branding|branding]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Submission to senior members of the group is common. Abject "etiquette" required of pledges or subordinates may include prostration, kneeling, literal groveling, and kissing body parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giménez|first1=Mar|title=Hidden harm|url=http://hazingprevention.org/home/hazing/hidden-harm/|website=Hazing Prevention|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other physical feats may be required, such as [[calisthenics]] and other physical tests, such as [[mud wrestling]], forming a [[human pyramid]], or climbing a greased pole. Exposure to the elements may be required, such as swimming or diving in cold water or snow.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Orientation tests may be held, such as abandoning pledges without transport. Dares include jumping from some height, stealing from police or rival teams and obedience.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  [[Blood wings|Blood pinning]] among military aviators (and many other elite groups) to celebrate becoming new pilots is done by piercing their chests with the sharp pins of aviator wings.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

On a pilot's [[first solo flight]], they are often drenched with water, as well as having the back of their shirt cut off to celebrate the achievement. Cutting off the back of the shirt originates from the days of tandem trainers, where the instructor sat behind the student and tugged on the back of their shirt in order to get their attention. Cutting off the back of the shirt symbolizes that the instructor has no need to do that anymore. &lt;ref&gt;Marchado, Rod, "First Solo Flight", Microsoft Flight Simulator X&lt;/ref&gt;

On their first ''[[crossing the equator]]'' in military and commercial navigation, each "pollywog" is subjected to a series of tests usually including running or crawling a gauntlet of abuse and various scenes supposedly situated at King Neptune's court. A ''pledge auction'' is a variation on the [[slave auction (BDSM)|slave auction]], where people bid on the paraded pledges.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Hazing may also include subjecting the pledge to severe sleep deprivation until physical or mental impairment or hallucinations, including cardiac, digestive or excretory disturbances, are induced, and deliberate food poisonings unbeknownst to the pledge, sometimes through food outlets that are owned or franchised by members of the group, as well as public incidents, stunt accidents and vehicle collisions directed at the pledge by other persons using false identities who are unfamiliar to the pledge, and the practice of "The Silence", which is to [[gaslighting|gaslight]] the hazee, pretending not to know anything about the hazing or anything about the arguments being presented by the hazing, in order to force the pledge to doubt his or her sanity or self-worth. "The Silence" is exercised through covert means of infliction, at a distance, which makes it difficult for the victim to prove to law enforcement or to others. This method usually attempts to make everything that could go wrong, go wrong to the fault of the pledge, even when such errors are discreetly inflicted by the hazers. The hazers may deny the validity of the pledge's witness to events, discoveries, ideas and inventions, tangible reality, or falsify personal relationships.

When the hazers are associated with a larger organization, for instance, a major university that controls the local public hospitals, a pledge may encounter abusive behaviors or neglect when seeking needed medical help when the doctors or personnel are of the fraternity. This may also occur when the pledge seeks help from public employees who are also associated. This is done in order to isolate the pledge from their personal identity, their needs and others.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Hazings may occur in the home against nonconsenting, involuntary pledges when the family or cohabitants are already members of an organization or group that exercises hazing as a prerequisite for membership, even when "the pledge" has refused to join the group. The pledge may not have previously been informed of his or her cohabitant's association, particularly when such associations involve a covert organization. The hazers may attempt to inflict guilt on a sleep-deprived and beleaguered pledge "for providing a home", or they may fake "family emergencies or tragedies" against any prevailing medical needs of the pledge due to neglect and abuse.
In this instance, the subject may be branded as "pariah" or as an "outcast", in which case they are then subjected to neglect, abuse, violence, or methods such as "The Silence", and at risk of persecution if and when they speak of their hazing experiences to others outside of the group. This may be particularly true when the organization or group has violated civil rights, or the law. "The Silence" may include the hazers speaking in cryptic puns and double-entendre in order to either communicate their instructions to the pledge in a manner that they cannot be held accountable for, or to mislead the pledge. They may mislead the pledge due to a financial conflict of interest, for instance, a hazing by a family who is in charge of a guardian trust belonging to the pledge, or due to taking unlawful advantage of the pledge, their person or their property rights. This form of hazing may be unlawfully executed in order to force the pledge to release the hazers from their liabilities, as an act of extortion.

Hazing also occurs for apprentices in some trades. In printing, it consists of applying bronze blue to the apprentice's [[penis]] and [[testicles]], a color made by mixing black printers ink and dark blue printers ink, which takes a long time to wash off. Similarly, mechanics get their groins smeared with old dirty grease.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Hazing by women of their suitors, often assisted by the women's friends, can also play a role in budding romantic relationships, usually taking mental and psychological rather than physical forms, and apparently for the same basic purposes as other hazing.

== Psychology, sociology, purpose, and effects ==

Hazing supposedly serves a deliberate purpose of building [[solidarity]].  Psychologist [[Robert Cialdini]] uses the framework of consistency and commitment to explain the phenomenon of hazing and the vigor and zeal to which practitioners of hazing persist in and defend these activities even when they are made illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert |last=Cialdini|title=Influence: Science and Practice|edition= 4|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|year= 2001|pages= 76–78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRkxsDq8CgAC|isbn=9780321011473}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cialdini cites a 1959 study in which the researchers observed that "persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to attain something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with a minimum of effort."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://faculty.uncfsu.edu/tvancantfort/Syllabi/Gresearch/Readings/A_Aronson.pdf |first=Elliott |last=Aronson |first2=Judson |last2=Mills |title=The effect of severity of initiation on liking for a group |journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=59 |issue=2 |year=1959 |pages=177–181 |doi=10.1037/h0047195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1959 study shaped the development of [[cognitive dissonance]] theory by [[Leon Festinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Festinger |first=L. |year=1961 |title=The psychological effects of insufficient rewards |journal=American Psychologist |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1037/h0045112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists excel at understanding and explaining why certain group behaviors occur, especially when it comes to hazing; there are studies that better explain what actually happens psychologically and provide more insight into what happens within themselves. There are many different types of hazing. It can be seen in fraternities and sororities, sports teams, and other social clubs/organizations; within these organizations, there are psychological effects that both the hazer and hazee endure. In an article published by Raalte, Cornelius, Linder, and Brewer, they used team sports as a sample of their study. In the article, there seemed to be a more positive outlook of the idea of hazing. During the hazing process, there was a bond between the two parties (the hazer and the hazee) that grew and, in turn, created a more positive influence in the specific community&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/c04784820dceba18dd09a1862c81c9d9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=30153|title=The Relationship Between Hazing and Team Cohesion - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;; naturally, people would do it more because it’s seen as positive People want to be accepted and sometimes, people will do anything to get it. Maybe someone is a social outcast and their only way to gain recognition is to join a certain club or organization. If they were to haze that person, it would show to himself and the others that his means to be accepted knows no bounds. If this person were not to join, they would probably be outed and/or ostracized from that community to many others which could lead to other psychological effects.Beyond a legal approach, eliminating or lessening the dangers of hazing requires an understanding and application of psychological and sociological factors. This is especially critical when many view hazing as an effective way to teach respect and develop discipline and loyalty within the group, and believe that hazing is a necessary component of initiation rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollmann|first= B. B. |year=2002|title=Hazing: Hidden campus crime|journal= New Directions for Student Services|pages= 11–24|doi= 10.1002/ss.57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazing is a way of building conformity into a social group, something that can be seen in many sociological studies.{{cn|date=September 2017}} Moreover, initiation rituals when managed effectively can serve to build team cohesion and improve team performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Jamie|last2=Johnstone|first2=James|last3=Banks|first3=Curt|date=2018|title=An examination of initiation rituals in a UK sporting institution and the impact on group development|url=http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984|journal=European Sport Management Quarterly|doi=10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984}}&lt;/ref&gt; while negative and detrimental forms of hazing alienate and disparage individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crow|first=Brian|last2=Macintosh|first2=Eric|date=2009|title=Conceptualizing a Meaningful Definition of Hazing in Sport|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/16184740903331937|journal=European Sport Management Quarterly|doi=10.1080/16184740903331937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissonance can produce feelings of group [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]] or [[social identity]] among initiates after the hazing experience because they want to justify the effort used. [[Reward system|Rewards]] during initiations or hazing rituals matter in that initiates who feel more rewarded express stronger group identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kamau |first=C. |year=2013 |title=What does being initiated severely into a group do?

In an article published by Linda Wilson, she and the National Pan-Hellenic Council Leaders at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University gave their perspectives and opinions on hazing at their institution, and she discussed why hazing is so hard to discontinue. The reason why is because the act of hazing is deeply rooted traditionally, so it becomes hard to break those traditional actions&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Richardon|date=2018|title=The National Pan-Hellenic Council Leaders' Perspectives on the Impact of Moral Thoughts and Actions on Hazing|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.xula.edu/docview/2050757832?accountid=40599|journal=DAI-A 79/10(E), Dissertation Abstracts International|pages=187|via=ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses A&amp;I}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, York College in Pennsylvania tried to solve this issue with suspending students who partake in the act. However, it's hard to dismantle not only because of tradition, but also because it's meant to be done in private spaces. It isn't meant to be public which makes getting rid of it even harder.

A 2014 paper by [[Harvey Whitehouse]]&lt;ref name="WhitehouseLanman2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitehouse|first1=Harvey|last2=Lanman|first2=Jonathan A.|title=The Ties That Bind Us|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=55|issue=6|year=2014|pages=674–695|issn=0011-3204|doi=10.1086/678698}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses theories that hazing can cause social cohesion though [[group identification]] and [[identity fusion]]. A 2017 study published in ''[[Scientific Reports]]'' found that groups that share painful or strong negative experiences can cause visceral{{vague|date=June 2017}} bonding, and pro-group behavior.&lt;ref name="WhitehouseJong2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitehouse|first1=Harvey|last2=Jong|first2=Jonathan|last3=Buhrmester|first3=Michael D.|last4=Gómez|first4=Ángel|last5=Bastian|first5=Brock|last6=Kavanagh|first6=Christopher M.|last7=Newson|first7=Martha|last8=Matthews|first8=Miriam|last9=Lanman|first9=Jonathan A.|last10=McKay|first10=Ryan|last11=Gavrilets|first11=Sergey|title=The evolution of extreme cooperation via shared dysphoric experiences|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=7|year=2017|pages=44292|issn=2045-2322|doi=10.1038/srep44292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students of [[Brazilian Jiu Jitsu]] who had experienced painful belt-whipping gauntlets had a higher willingness to donate time or risk their lives for the club.

===United States===
{{also|List of hazing deaths in the United States}}

According to one of the largest US National Surveys regarding hazing including over 60,000 student athletes from 2,400 colleges and universities:&lt;ref name=Alfred&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alfred.edu/sports_hazing/howmanystudents.cfm |publisher=Alfred University |title=National Survey of Sports Teams|accessdate= 27 May 2013|first=Nadine C.|last=Hoover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Over 325,000 athletes at more than 1,000 National Collegiate Athletic Association schools in the US participated in intercollegiate sports during 1998–99. Of these athletes:
*More than a quarter of a million experienced some form of hazing to join a college athletic team.
* One in five was subjected to unacceptable and potentially illegal hazing. They were kidnapped, beaten or tied up and abandoned. They were also forced to commit crimes&amp;nbsp;– destroying property, making prank phone calls or harassing others.
* Half were required to participate in drinking contests or alcohol-related hazing.
* Two in five consumed alcohol on recruitment visits even before enrolling.
* Two-thirds were subjected to humiliating hazing, such as being yelled or sworn at, forced to wear embarrassing clothing (if any clothing at all) or forced to deprive themselves of sleep, food or personal hygiene.
* One in five participated exclusively in positive initiations, such as team trips or ropes courses.}}

The survey found that 79% of college athletes experienced some form of hazing to join their team, yet 60% of the student-athletes respondents indicated that they would not report incidents of hazing.&lt;ref name=Alfred/&gt;

A 2007 survey at American colleges found 55% of students in "clubs, teams, and organizations" experienced behavior the survey defined as hazing, including in varsity athletics and [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek-letter organizations]]. This survey found 47% of respondents experienced hazing before college, and in 25% of hazing cases, school staff were aware of the activity. 90% of students who experienced behavior the researchers defined as hazing did not consider themselves to have been hazed, and 95% of those who experienced what they themselves defined as hazing did not report it. The most common hazing-related activities reported in student groups included alcohol consumption, humiliation, isolation, sleep deprivation, and sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stophazing.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/hazing_in_view_web1.pdf|title=Hazing in View: College Students at Risk Initial Findings from the National Study of Student Hazing|date=2008-03-11|accessdate=2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some chapters of fraternities and sororities have developed complex hazing rituals that range from demeaning tasks to embarrassing ceremonies. These practices are most common in, but not limited to, North American schools.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Other groups within university life that have hazing rituals include competition teams, fan clubs, social groups, secret societies and even certain [[service club]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} While hazing is less common in high schools, some secondary education institutions have developed hazing rituals.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The armed forces have long had hazing rituals, which often involve violence and punishments. The United States military defines hazing as unnecessarily exposing a fellow soldier to an act which is cruel, abusive, oppressive, or harmful. In the modern western military, which combines discipline with welfare priorities, initiation practices can cause controversy. There is a tradition in many military&amp;nbsp;– especially elite&amp;nbsp;– corps of subjecting the newly trained ranks to a hell night-like "joining run", a macho preparation of men in the prime of their lives for the ordeals of warfare, going beyond what most civilians (and even many service personnel) would find acceptable; it usually combines humiliation (such as nudity) with physical endurance.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Police forces, especially those with a [[paramilitary]] tradition, or sub-units of police forces such as tactical teams, may also have hazing rituals. Rescue services, such as [[lifeguard]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://journaltimes.com/news/national/lifeguards-fired-for-hazing-new-squad-members/article_64593575-d16b-599b-80e6-f2caf8642c02.html|date=July 18, 1997|title=Lifeguards fired for hazing new squad members|publisher=The Journal Times|accessdate= 2013-06-03|location=Racine, WI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/-City-Probes-Nude-Lifeguard-Hazing-Incident-100481584.html|date=Aug 11, 2010|last=Page|first= Eric S.|title=City Probes Alleged Nude Lifeguard Hazing Incident|publisher=NBC San Diego|accessdate= 2013-06-03}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or air-sea rescue teams may have hazing rituals.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, the so-called 'traditional fraternities' have an introduction time which includes hazing rituals. The pledges go for a few days to a camp during which they undergo hazing rituals but are meanwhile introduced in the traditions of the fraternity. After camp, there are usually evenings or whole days in which the pledges have to be present at the fraternity, although slowly the pressure is released and the relations become somewhat more equal. Often, pledges collect or perform chores to raise funds for charity. At the end of the hazing period, the inauguration of the new members take place.

Incidents have occurred resulting in injuries and death. Often these incidents occur when members wish to join a house, (prestigious) sub-structure or commission for which they undergo a second (and usually heavier) hazing ritual. Incidents mostly occur during hazing rituals for these sub-structures, since there is less or no control from the fraternity board. Also, these sub-structure hazing rituals involve often excessive alcohol abuse, even when alcohol has become a taboo in hazing of the fraternity itself. Other situations causing additional risks for incidents are members (often joining the hazing camp but not designated with any responsibility) separating pledges and taking them away from the main group to 'amuse themselves' with them.

In 1965 a student at [[Utrecht University]] choked to death during a hazing ritual (''Roetkapaffaire''). There was public outrage when the perpetrators were convicted to light conditional sentences while left-wing [[Provo (movement)|Provo]] demonstrators were given unconditional prison sentences for order disturbances. The fact that the magistrates handling the case were all alumni of the same fraternity gave rise to accusions of nepotism and class justice. Two incidents in 1997, leading to one heavy injury and one death, lead to sharpened scrutiny over hazing. Hazing incidents have nevertheless occurred since, but justice is becoming keener in persecuting perpetrators.

The Netherlands has no anti-hazing legislation. Hazing incidents can be handled by internal resolution by the fraternity itself (the lightest cases), and via the criminal justice system as [[assault]] or in case of death [[negligent homicide]] or [[manslaughter]]. Universities as a rule support student unions (financially and by granting board members of such union a discount on the required number of ECTS credits) but can in the most extreme case suspend or withdraw recognition and support for such union.

===Philippines===
{{also|List of hazing deaths in the Philippines}}

According to R. Dayao, hazing, usually in initiation rites of fraternities, has a long history in the [[Philippines]], and has been a source of public controversy after many cases that resulted to death of the neophyte. The first recorded death due to hazing in the Philippines was recorded in 1954, with the death of Gonzalo Mariano Albert. Hazing was regulated under the [[Anti-Hazing Act of 1995]], after the death of Leonardo Villa in 1991, but many cases, usually causing severe injury or death, continued even after it was enacted, the latest involving [[Horacio Castillo III]], a College of Law student from the [[University of Santo Tomas]].

===Ragging in South Asia===
Ragging is a practice similar to hazing in educational institutions in South Asia. The word is mainly used in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. Ragging involves existing students baiting or [[bullying]] new students. It often takes a malignant form wherein the newcomers may be subjected to [[psychological torture|psychological]] or [[physical torture|physical]] torture.&lt;ref name=definition-ngo&gt;{{cite news

The practice of ritual abuse among social groups is not clearly understood. This is partly due to the secretive nature of the activities, especially within collegiate fraternities and sororities, and in part a result of long-term acceptance of hazing. Thus, it has been difficult for researchers to agree on the underlying social and psychological mechanisms that perpetuate hazing. In military circles hazing is sometimes assumed to test recruits under situations of stress and hostility. Although in no way a recreation of combat, hazing does put people into stressful situations that they are unable to control, which allegedly should weed out the weaker members prior to being put in situations where failure to perform will cost lives. A portion of the military training course known as [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]] (SERE) simulates as closely as is feasible the physical and psychological conditions of a [[POW]] camp.

The problem with this approach, according to opponents, is that the stress and hostility comes from ''inside'' the group, and not from ''outside'' as in actual combat situation, creating suspicion and distrust towards the superiors and comrades-in-arms. Willing participants may be motivated by a desire to prove to senior soldiers their stability in future combat situations, making the unit more secure, but blatantly brutal hazing can in fact produce negative results, making the units more prone to break, desert or mutiny than those without hazing traditions, as observed in the Russian army in [[Chechnya]], where units with the strongest traditions of [[dedovschina]] were the first to break and desert under enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Sean |last=Renaud| title=A View from Chechnya: An Assessment of Russian Counterinsurgency During the two Chechen Wars and Future Implications | page=78|url=http://muir.massey.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10179/1804/02_whole.pdf|year=2010|publisher= Massey University|location=Palmerston North, NZ|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; At worst, hazing may lead into [[fragging]] incidents. Colleges and universities sometimes avoid publicizing hazing incidents for fear of damaging institutional reputations or incurring financial liability to victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Sweet |first=Stephen|title= College and Society: An Introduction to Sociological Imagination|year= 2001|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|pages=19–37|isbn=978-0205305568|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/College_and_society.html?id=840lAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1999 study, a survey of 3,293 collegiate athletes, coaches, athletic directors and deans found a variety of approaches to prevent hazing, including strong disciplinary and corrective measures for known cases, implementation of athletic, behavioral, and academic standards guiding recruitment; provisions for alternative bonding and recognition events for teams to prevent hazing; and law enforcement involvement in monitoring, investigating, and prosecuting hazing incidents.&lt;ref name=Alfred/&gt; Hoover's research suggested half of all college athletes are involved in alcohol-related hazing incidents, while one in five are involved in potentially illegal hazing incidents. Only another one in five was involved in what Hoover described as positive initiation events, such as taking team trips or running obstacle courses.

Hoover wrote: "Athletes most at risk for any kind of hazing for college sports were men; non-Greek members; and either swimmers, divers, soccer players, or lacrosse players. The campuses where hazing was most likely to occur were primarily in eastern or southern states with no anti-hazing laws. The campuses were rural, residential, and had Greek systems."&lt;ref name=Alfred/&gt; (Hoover uses the term "Greek" to refer to U.S.-style fraternities and sororities.) Hoover found that non-fraternity members were most at risk of hazing, and that football players are most at risk of potentially dangerous or illegal hazing.&lt;ref name=Alfred/&gt; In the May issue of the ''American Journal of Emergency Medicine'', Michelle Finkel reported that hazing injuries are often not recognized for their true cause in emergency medical centers. The doctor said hazing victims sometimes hide the real cause of injuries out of shame or to protect those who caused the harm. In protecting their abusers, hazing victims can be compared with victims of domestic violence, Finkel wrote.&lt;ref name=AJEM&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finkel|first= Michelle A., MD|url=http://njbullying.org/documents/hazing-EDarticleFinkel2002.pdf|format=PDF|title=Traumatic Injuries Caused By Hazing Practices|journal=American Journal of Emergency Medicine|volume= 20|number= 3 |date=May 2002|accessdate= 27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkel cites hazing incidents including "beating or kicking to the point of [[Physical trauma|traumatic injury]] or death, burning or [[branding persons|branding]], excessive [[calisthenics]], being forced to eat unpleasant substances, and psychological or sexual abuse of both males and females". Reported coerced sexual activity is sometimes considered "horseplay" rather than rape, she wrote.&lt;ref name=AJEM/&gt; Finkel quoted from Hank Nuwer's book "Wrongs of Passage" which counted 56 hazing deaths between 1970 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHM9ltEQIU0C|title=Wrongs of Passage|first=Hank|last= Nuwer|publisher=Indiana University Press|year= 2001|isbn=9780253214980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, controversy arose over a video showing [[Royal Marines]] fighting naked and intoxicated as part of a hazing ritual. The fight culminated with one soldier receiving a kick to the face, rendering him unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1504191/Police-investigate-video-of-beaten-marine.html|title=Police investigate video of beaten marine|accessdate=2009-01-30

Under further investigation, the Marines had just returned from a six-month tour of Iraq, and were in their "cooling down" period, in which they spend two weeks at a naval base before they are allowed back into society. The man who suffered the kick to the head did not press charges.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In 2008, a national hazing study was conducted by Dr Elizabeth Allan and Dr Mary Madden from the University of Maine. This investigation is the most comprehensive study of hazing to date and includes survey responses from more than 11,000 undergraduate students at 53 colleges and universities in different regions of the U.S. and interviews with more than 300 students and staff at 18 of these campuses. Through the vision and efforts of many, this study fills a major gap in the research and extends the breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding about hazing. Ten initial findings are described in the report, Hazing in View: College Students at Risk. These include:
# More than half of college students involved in clubs, teams, and organizations experience hazing.
# Nearly half (47%) of students have experienced hazing prior to coming to college.
# Alcohol consumption, humiliation, isolation, sleep deprivation, and sex acts are hazing practices common across student groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allan|first=Elizabeth|title=Hazing in View: College Students at Risk|url=http://www.stophazing.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/hazing_in_view_web1.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=University of Maine, College of Education and Human Development|accessdate=21 May 2010|author2=Mary Madden|date=11 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''1900''': Oscar Booz began at West Point in June 1898 in good physical health. Four months later, he resigned due to health problems. He died in December 1900 of [[tuberculosis]]. During his long struggle with the illness, he blamed the illness on hazing he received at West Point in 1898, claiming he had hot sauce poured down his throat on three occasions as well as a number of other grueling hazing practices, such as brutal beatings and having hot wax poured on him in the night. His family claimed that scarring from the hot sauce made him more susceptible to the infection, causing his death.

*'''1903''': Three young boys, aged 11, 10, and 7, read about hazing practices in college and decided to try it themselves. They built a fire in a pasture behind the schoolhouse and led 9-year-old Ralph Canning to the spot. They heated a number of stones until they were red hot. The boys forced Canning to both sit and stand on the hot stones and held him there despite his screams. The boys then either walked or jumped on him (depending on the source). He was finally allowed to leave and he crawled home, where he died two weeks later. The public was stunned by the young age of the perpetrators.&lt;ref name="Canning"&gt;{{cite news|title=Many are badly injured, some of victims disfigured, cases of hazing at girls schools|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/63185581|agency=The Topeka Daily Capital|date=January 14, 1906|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FAMU incident prompted [[Rick Scott|Florida Governor Rick Scott]] to order all state universities to examine their hazing and harassment policies in December. Scott also asked all university presidents to remind their students, faculty and staff "how detrimental hazing can be".&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/03/justice/florida-hazing-charges/index.html?hpt=us_c2 | work=CNN | title=9 charged with hazing at University of Florida fraternity | date=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2013''': Chun Hsien Deng, a freshman at [[Baruch College]], died during a hazing incident after he was blindfolded and made to wear a backpack weighted with sand while trying to make his way across a frozen yard as members of a fraternity, [[Pi Delta Psi]], tried to tackle him. During at least one tackle, he was lifted up and dropped on the ground in a move known as spearing. He complained his head hurt but continued participating and was eventually knocked out. After Mr. Deng was knocked unconscious, the authorities said the fraternity members delayed in seeking medical help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/15/nyregion/5-from-baruch-college-face-murder-charges-in-2013-fraternity-hazing.html|title=5 From Baruch College Face Murder Charges in 2013 Fraternity Hazing|work=The New York Times| date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Career===
Known by his middle name, J. Paul Reddam was born in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]], Canada, and graduated from the [[University of Windsor]] with a bachelor's degree in psychology. He then obtained a master's degree in philosophy from the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name="NTRA bio"/&gt; In 1979, he moved to California to earn his Ph.D. at the [[University of Southern California]] and made his home in the state.&lt;ref name="NTRA bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20120505/SPORTS0801/305050151/College-professor-turned-loan-agent-hits-big-owner-Kentucky-Derby-winner?odyssey=nav|head College professor turned loan agent hits it big as owner of Kentucky Derby winner]&lt;/ref&gt; Reddam wrote his Ph.D. dissertation, entitled "Pragmatics and the Language of Belief," in 1982, focusing on "pragmatic theories of belief ascription." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://philpapers.org/rec/REDPAT-2 | work=PhilPapers | first=J. Paul | last=Reddam | title=Pragmatics and the Language of Belief | date=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, he established a mortgage lending company, [[Ditech]], and sold the business to [[General Motors]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="NTRA bio"/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/sports/belmont-stakes-ill-have-anothers-owner-is-one-win-from-triple-crown.html | work=The New York Times | first=Richard | last=Sandomir | title=Belmont Stakes: Reddam Is One Win From Triple Crown | date=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that [[Governor of California]] [[Jerry Brown]] characterized Reddam's company's debt collection methods as loan sharking.

He now owns [[CashCall, Inc.]], another firm specializing in small loans at very high interest rates.

===Horse racing===
As a young man, Reddam became interested in the [[harness racing|harness races]] held at [[Windsor Raceway]] that eventually led to his involvement as an owner while working as a university professor in [[Los Angeles]]. He used to have [[Standardbred]] horses competing at Windsor Raceway (has since closed down) and at [[California Exposition and State Fair|Cal Expo]] in [[Sacramento, California]]. In 1988 he acquired his first Thoroughbred and has expanded his involvement to a current forty-horse racing stable plus twenty [[Mare (horse)|broodmare]]s for his own [[horse breeding|breeding]] operations through arrangements with breeding farms in California and [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talkin' Horses with J. Paul Reddam|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/163111/talkin-horses-with-j-paul-reddam|publisher=Blood-Horse LLC|accessdate=8 May 2016|date=October 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely respected in the industry for his strong support of Thoroughbred racing, Reddam's first major success came in 2004 with a win by 75%-owned [[Wilko (horse)|Wilko]] in the [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://files.ntra.com/stats_bios.aspx?id=17319 Wilko's race record at the NTRA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926022546/http://files.ntra.com/stats_bios.aspx?id=17319 |date=2015-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his next in 2006 with [[Red Rocks (horse)|Red Rocks]] in the [[Breeders' Cup Turf]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.ntra.com/stats_bios.aspx?id=20984 Red Rock's race record at the NTRA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926005308/http://files.ntra.com/stats_bios.aspx?id=20984 |date=2015-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His Thoroughbred racing stable is led by head [[horse trainer|trainer]] [[Doug O'Neill]], with several  horses being conditioned by [[Craig Dollase]]. His greatest achievement came when his colt [[I'll Have Another]], from 19th position, won the [[2012 Kentucky Derby]] and the 2012 [[Preakness Stakes]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the trainer used by Reddam was suspended for drug violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/sports/belmont-stakes-ill-have-anothers-owner-is-one-win-from-triple-crown.html|title=In Other Races: Paying Back the Owner of a Triple Crown Hopeful|author=Sandomir, Richard|date=June 5, 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His horse [[Nyquist (horse)|Nyquist]] won the Kentucky Derby in 2016. [[Nyquist (horse)|Nyquist]] and [[I'll Have Another]] were both trained by [[Doug O'Neill]] and won the 2012 and 2016 Kentucky Derby races with jockey [[Mario Gutierrez (jockey)|Mario Gutierrez]].

===Controversies===
Reddam resigned from Ditech in May 2000 after three of his top managers were indicted for extortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/02/business/fi-25536|title=

Reddam sued GMAC Mortgage Corp in 2000, alleging that the company failed to pay $200 million that it owed after acquiring Ditech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.articlelatimes.com/2000/aug/31/business/fi-13133|title=DiTech Founder Sues GMAC Over Payments|author=Strickland, Daryl|date=August 31, 2000|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Reddam was sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for violating consumer protection laws in a case related to Cashcall and other companies he was involved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.drf.com/news/cashcall-reddam-being-sued-consumer-financial-protection-bureau|title=CashCall, Reddam being sued by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|author=Hegarty, Richard|date=December 17, 2013|work=The Daily Racing Form|accessdate=February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Downey''' (born July 4, 1958) is a US author and rare book &amp; document conservator. He is also known as an internet performance artist, who has organized two relatively high-profile stunts, "Paint the Moon" and "Nobel Prize for Jo". In addition, he is one of the principals behind the ballistics research project ''[[Ballistics by the Inch]]'' and a writer for [http://www.guns.com/ Guns.com].

Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Downey graduated from [[Grinnell College]] in Iowa, and did graduate work in English Literature at the [[University of Iowa]]. While there he discovered the Iowa Center for the Book, where he learned bookbinding, papermaking and book conservation, launching his career as a book and paper conservator. While at Iowa he also took classes with the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]], which furthered his desire to write.

==Books==

===''Communion of Dreams''===
Downey's first novel, ''Communion of Dreams''&lt;ref name=Communion&gt;{{cite web|title=Communion of Dreams|url=http://communionofdreams.com/|accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in January 2012. Set in 2052, when the human race is still struggling to recover from a massive pandemic flu some 40 years earlier. When an independent prospector on Saturn's moon [[Titan in fiction|Titan]] discovers an alien artifact, assumptions that we are alone in the universe are called into question. Knowing that news of such a discovery could prompt chaos on Earth, a small team is sent to investigate and hopefully manage the situation. What they find is that there's more to human history, and human abilities, than any of them ever imagined. And that they will need all those insights, and all those abilities, to face the greatest threat yet to human survival.

===''Her Final Year''===
Downey has also written, with co-author John Bourke, a memoir of care giving for their respective mothers-in-law. That memoir, ''Her Final Year'',&lt;ref name=HFY&gt;{{cite web|title=Her Final Year|url=http://herfinalyear.com/index.html|accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in July 2011. The book offers some perspective on the experience of caregiving for a victim of [[dementia]] from the point of view of people living it. It is part memoir, part journal, and all based on blog posts, e-mails, and journal entries they and their wives wrote at the time. The authors were both full-time in-home care givers and felt that reading about their experiences, their difficulties and decisions, and their recoveries, would be helpful to others currently in a care giving role.

==Internet projects==
Downey organized two relatively high-profile internet projects which gained some notoriety at the time.

===Lasers at the moon (''Paint the Moon'')===
In 2001, working off an idea in a novel he was writing (''Communion of Dreams''), Downey theorised that there may be enough laser powered pens to show a red spot on the Moon. He created a simple website and dubbed the project ''Paint the Moon''. As a 'collective lyric fantasy', he encouraged anyone in possession of a laser pen to point it at the Moon at a specified time on a certain date, theoretically to create a dot on the Moon's surface. "Uniting millions of people around the globe to attempt this ostensibly impossible task is a new kind of performance art," Downey wrote on his site. The idea was picked up on the web and in the media, and generated a lot of worldwide attention, including interviews with Howard Stern and on [[Weekend Edition Saturday]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1127603&lt;/ref&gt; Though many responded back with e-mails notifying Downey of their participation, the project was a failure in its ostensible goal. [[Eric Van Stryland]], director of Center for Research in Electro-Optics and Lasers at the [[University of Central Florida]] noted to USA Today that although it's "still a fun idea", such a project would need "at least a few million billion red laser pointers to see a big red spot on the moon."

===Harry Potter Nobel Prize letter writing campaign===
In 2003, Downey attempted to win [[Harry Potter]] author [[J. K. Rowling]] a 2004 Nobel Prize for Literature, by organising a letter writing campaign via e-mail. Attempting to get author Rowling considered for the prestigious award, he created a website launched in July 2003 called the "Nobel Prize For Jo", urging the global community to participate. On his web page, he was quoted as saying that "I bet if we sent them a few hundred thousand letters, they'd pay attention." Hailed by the BBC as an "Internet crusade", it failed to get any letters sent in, and Downey happily concedes that it is probably his greatest failure to date.  "Even the Harry Potter fans hated the idea," said Downey. Only one hundred people are reported to have e-mailed to the address provided.

Only literary professors, members of literature academies, and past winners of the prize may submit suggestions for Nobel recipients. A fan-based campaign alone would not have caused Rowling to win the prize.

'''Jane Jacobs''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|OOnt}} (''née'' '''Butzner'''; May 4, 1916 – April 25, 2006) was an [[American-Canadian]] [[journalist]], [[author]], and [[activist]] who influenced [[urban studies]], [[sociology]], and [[economics]]. Her book ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' (1961) argued that [[urban renewal]] did not respect the needs of city-dwellers. It also introduced the [[sociological]] concepts "eyes on the street" and "[[social capital]]".&lt;ref name="DMartin"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/25/books/25cnd-jacobs.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Jane Jacobs, Urban Activist, Is Dead at 89 |author=Douglas Martin|date=April 26, 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Death and Life of Great American Cities |last=Jacobs |first=Jane |page=138 |quote=If self-government in the place is to work, underlying any float of population must be a continuity of people who have forged neighborhood networks. These networks are a city's irreplaceable social capital. Whenever the capital is lost, from whatever cause, the income from it disappears, never to return until and unless new capital is slowly and chancily accumulated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs organized [[grassroots]] efforts to protect neighborhoods from "[[slum clearance]]", in particular [[Robert Moses]]' plans to overhaul her own [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood. She was instrumental in the eventual cancellation of the [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]], which would have passed directly through [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] and [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]]. She was arrested in 1968 for inciting a crowd at a public hearing on that project. After moving to Toronto in 1968, she joined the opposition to the [[Spadina Expressway]] and the associated [[Cancelled expressways in Toronto|network of expressways in Toronto]] planned, and under construction.

As a mother and a writer who criticized experts in the male-dominated field of [[urban planning]], Jacobs endured scorn from established figures. She did not have a [[college degree]] or any formal training in urban planning, and her lack of credentials was seized upon as grounds for criticism.

==Early years==
Jacobs was born '''Jane Butzner''' in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], the daughter of Bess Robison Butzner, a former teacher and nurse and John Decker Butzner, a physician. They were a Protestant family in a heavily Roman Catholic town.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother, [[John Decker Butzner, Jr.]], served as a judge on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]]. After graduation from [[Scranton School District (Pennsylvania)|Scranton High School]], she worked for a year as the unpaid assistant to the women's page editor at the ''[[Scranton Tribune]]''.

===New York City===
In 1935, during the [[Great Depression]], she moved to New York City with her sister Betty.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Jane Butzner took an immediate liking to Manhattan's [[Greenwich Village]], which did not conform to the city's [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811|grid structure]]. The sisters soon moved there from Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

During her early years in the city, Jacobs held a variety of jobs working as a [[stenographer]] and [[freelance writer]], writing about working districts in the city. These experiences, she later said, "gave me more of a notion of what was going on in the city and what business was like, what work was like." Her first job was for a trade magazine as a secretary, then an editor. She sold articles to the ''Sunday Herald Tribune'', ''Cue'' magazine, and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied at [[Columbia University]]'s [[Columbia University School of General Studies|School of General Studies]] for two years, taking courses in [[geology]], [[zoology]], law, [[political science]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; About the freedom to pursue study across her wide-ranging interests, she said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the first time I liked school and for the first time I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the property of [[Barnard College]] at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not what I wanted to learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard decided I could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ideas that Matter: The Worlds of Jane Jacobs|editor=Allen, Max (ed)|publisher=Ginger Press|date=1997-10-01
|isbn=0-921773-44-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Career==
After attending Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years, Butzner found a job at ''Iron Age'' magazine. Her 1943 article on economic decline in Scranton was well-publicized and led the [[Murray Corporation of America]] to locate a warplane factory there. Encouraged by this success, Butzner petitioned the [[War Production Board]] to support more operations in Scranton.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiencing job discrimination at ''Iron Age'', she also advocated for [[equal pay for women]] and for the right of workers to unionize.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Amerika''===
She became a feature writer for the [[Office of War Information]], and then a reporter for ''[[Amerika (magazine)|Amerika]]'', a publication of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/708496/_The_Unknown_Jane_Jacobs_Reconsidering_Jane_Jacobs_Planners_Press_2011_|title="The Unknown Jane Jacobs," Reconsidering Jane Jacobs (Planners Press, 2011)|author=Peter Laurence|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working there she met Robert Hyde Jacobs Jr., a Columbia-educated architect who was designing warplanes for [[Grumman]]. They married in 1944. Together they had a daughter, Burgin, and two sons, James and Ned. They bought a three-story building at 555 [[Hudson Street (Manhattan)|Hudson St]]. Jane continued to write for ''Amerika'' after the war, while Robert left Grumman and resumed work as an architect.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jacobses rejected the rapidly growing [[suburbs]] as "parasitic", choosing to remain in Greenwich Village.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 29–30. "The suburbs did not appeal to the Jacobs family. 'Suburbs are perfectly valid places to want to live, but they are inherently parasitic, economically and socially, too, because they live off the answers found in cities,' Jacobs told a reporter for ''Madmoiselle'' magazine in October 1962."&lt;/ref&gt; They renovated their house, in the middle of a mixed residential and commercial area, and created a garden in the backyard.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Working for the State Department during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]] era, Jacobs received a questionnaire about her political beliefs and loyalties. Jacobs was anti-communist, and had left the [[Federal Workers Union]] because of its apparent communist sympathies. Nevertheless, she was pro-union and purportedly appreciated the writing of [[Saul Alinsky]]; therefore she was under suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 25, 1952, Jacobs delivered her response to Conrad E. Snow, chairman of the Loyalty Security Board at the [[United States Department of State]]. In her foreword to her answer, she said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The other threat to the security of our tradition, I believe, lies at home. It is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them. I do not agree with the extremists of either the left or the right, but I think they should be allowed to speak and to publish, both because they themselves have, and ought to have, rights, and once their rights are gone, the rights of the rest of us are hardly safe ...&lt;ref name="Allen, p. 170"&gt;Allen, pg. 170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Architectural Forum''===
Jacobs left ''Amerika'' in 1952 when it announced its relocation to Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/708475/_The_Death_and_Life_of_Urban_Design_Jane_Jacobs_the_Rockefeller_Foundation_and_the_New_Research_in_Urbanism_1955-1965_Journal_of_Urban_Design_2006|title="The Death and Life of Urban Design: Jane Jacobs, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the New Research in Urbanism, 1955–1965," Journal of Urban Design, 2006|author=Peter Laurence|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She found a well-paying job at ''[[Architectural Forum]]'', published by [[Henry Luce]] of [[Time Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; After early success on the job, Jacobs began to take assignments on urban planning and "[[urban blight]]".&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, she was assigned to cover a development in Philadelphia designed by [[Edmund Bacon (architect)|Edmund Bacon]]. Although her editors expected a positive story, Jacobs criticized Bacon's project, reacting against its lack of concern for the poor [[African American]]s who were directly affected. When Bacon showed Jacobs examples of undeveloped and developed blocks, she determined that "development" seemed to end community life on the street.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 39–40."' ... I said, "Where are the people?" [Bacon] didn't answer. He only said, "They don't appreciate these things."' At that moment, Jacobs realized that the high-rise projects that Bacon was so proud of had been designed with total disregard for its inhabitants."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; When Jacobs returned to the offices of ''Architectural Forum'', she began to question the 1950s consensus on urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 41. "When Jacobs returned to New York from Philadelphia, she began arguing with her ''Architectural Forum'' editors. All the hyped new projects that planners and architects were building in the cities, she told them, bore no relation to what people actually needed."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Jacobs met William Kirk, an Episcopal minister who worked in [[East Harlem]]. Kirk came to the ''Architectural Forum'' offices to describe the impact that "revitalization" had on East Harlem, and he introduced Jacobs to the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 43–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Jacobs delivered a lecture at Harvard University, standing in for [[Douglas Haskell]] of ''Architectural Forum''.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; She addressed leading architects, urban planners, and intellectuals (including [[Lewis Mumford]]), speaking on the topic of East Harlem. She urged this audience to "respect – in the deepest sense – strips of chaos that have a weird wisdom of their own not yet encompassed in our concept of urban order." Contrary to her expectations, the talk was received with enthusiasm, but it also marked her as a threat to established urban planners, real estate owners, and developers.&lt;ref name="Flint, 2009 pp. 24"&gt;Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), pp. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 57–59.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Architectural Forum'' printed the speech that year, along with photographs of East Harlem.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rockefeller Foundation and ''Death and Life of Great American Cities''===
After reading her Harvard speech, [[William H. Whyte]] invited Jacobs to write an article for ''[[Fortune magazine]]''. The resulting piece, "Downtown Is for People", appeared in a 1958 issue of ''Fortune'', and marked her first public criticism of [[Robert Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Her criticism of the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] was not popular with supporters of urban renewal at ''Architectural Forum'' and ''Fortune''.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. D. Jackson|C.D. Jackson]], the publisher of ''Fortune'', was outraged and demanded of Whyte over the phone: "Who is this crazy dame?"&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DeathAndLife.JPG|thumb|Cover of ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities'']]
The ''Fortune'' article brought Jacobs to the attention of Chadbourne Gilpatric, then associate director of the Humanities Division at the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurence, Peter L. "The Death and Life of Urban Design: Jane Jacobs, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the New Research in Urbanism, 1955–65", Journal of Urban Design 11 (June 2006), pp. 145–72.[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cjud/2006/00000011/00000002/art00001?crawler=true Ingentaconnect.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation had moved aggressively into urban topics, with a recent award to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] for studies of urban aesthetics that would culminate in the publication of [[Kevin A. Lynch]]'s ''Image of the City''.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; In May 1958, Gilpatric invited Jacobs to begin serving as a reviewer for grant proposals.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; Later that year, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] awarded a grant to Jacobs to produce a critical study of city planning and urban life in the U.S. (From the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, the foundation's Humanities Division sponsored an "Urban Design Studies" research program, of which Jacobs was the best known grantee.)&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; Gilpatric encouraged Jacobs to "explor[e] the field of urban design to look for ideas and actions which may improve thinking on how the design of cities might better serve urban life, including cultural and humane value."&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; Affiliating with [[The New School]] (then called The New School for Social Research), she spent three years conducting research and writing drafts. In 1961, Random House published the result: ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''.

''The Death and Life of Great American Cities'' remains one of the most influential books in the history of American city planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gratz|first1=Roberta Brandes|title=The Genius of Jane Jacobs|journal=The Nation|date=July 4, 1026|volume=303|issue=1|pages=16–17|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/the-genius-of-jane-jacobs-who-changed-the-way-we-think-about-cities/|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She coined the terms "[[social capital]]", "mixed primary uses", and "eyes on the street", which were adopted professionally in urban design, sociology, and other fields.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs painted a devastating picture of the profession of city planning, labeling it a [[pseudoscience]]. This angered the male-dominated urban planning profession. Jacobs was criticized as a "militant dame" and a "housewife": an amateur who had no right to interfere with an established discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 83–90.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was criticized from the left for leaving out race and accepting [[gentrification]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 she resigned her position at ''Architectural Forum'' to become a full-time author and mother.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In other political activities she became an [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|opponent of the Vietnam War]], [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam|marched on the Pentagon]] in October 1967&lt;ref name="Alexiou, 2006 p. 149"&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; and criticized the construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] as a disaster for Manhattan's waterfront.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Struggle for Greenwich Village===
During the 1950s and 1960s, Jacobs' home neighborhood of [[Greenwich Village]] was being transformed by City and State efforts to build housing (see, for example, Jacobs' fight to build the [[West Village Houses]] in lieu of large apartment houses), private developers, the expansion of [[New York University]] (NYU), and by the [[urban renewal]] plans of [[Robert Moses]]. Moses' plan, funded as "slum clearance" by Title I of the [[Housing Act of 1949]], also called for several blocks to be razed and replaced with upscale high-rises. The plan forced 132 families out of their homes and displaced 1,000 small businesses—the result was [[Washington Square Village]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Washington Square Park 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jacobs fought to prevent [[Washington Square Park]], pictured, from being demolished for a highway]]
As part of his efforts to revitalize the area, Moses proposed the extension of Fifth Avenue through Washington Square Park in 1935. In the face of community opposition, Moses shelved the project, but revived the idea in the 1950s. Moses argued that the Fifth Avenue extension would improve the flow of traffic through the neighborhood and provide access to the planned [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]] (LOMEX), which would connect the [[Manhattan Bridge]] and [[Williamsburg Bridge]] with the [[Holland Tunnel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wrestling with Moses|last=Flint|first=Anthony|publisher=Random House|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, local activist Shirley Hayes created the "Committee to Save Washington Square Park", a coalition of dozens of local neighborhood groups that opposed the roadway extension. [[Raymond Rubinow|Raymond S. Rubinow]] eventually took over the organization, changing its name to the "Joint Emergency Committee to Close Washington Square to Traffic." Jacobs had joined the committee under Hayes, but took a more prominent role under Rubinow, reaching out to media outlets such as ''[[The Village Voice]]'', which provided more sympathetic coverage than ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, pp83-84.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee gained the support of [[Margaret Mead]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Charles Abrams]], and [[William H. Whyte]], as well as [[Carmine De Sapio]], Greenwich Village resident and influential Democratic leader. De Sapio's involvement proved decisive.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 25, 1958, the city closed Washington Square Park to traffic, and the joint committee held a ribbon tying (not cutting) ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for LOMEX expressway continued despite growing community opposition in areas such as Little Italy. In the 1960s, Jacobs chaired the [[Joint Committee to Stop the Lower Manhattan Expressway]]. ''The New York Times'' was sympathetic to Moses, while ''The Village Voice'' covered community rallies and advocated against the expressway.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs continued to fight the expressway when plans resurfaced in 1962, 1965, and 1968, and she became a local hero for her opposition to the project.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; She was arrested by a plainclothes police officer on April 10, 1968, at a public hearing during which the crowd had charged the stage and destroyed the stenographer's notes.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), p. ''xiv''.&lt;/ref&gt; She was accused of inciting a riot, criminal mischief, and obstructing public administration. After months of trials conducted in New York City (to which Jacobs commuted from Toronto), her charge was reduced to disorderly conduct.&lt;ref name="DMartin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark Whelton, "[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-eVLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9YsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=jane%20jacobs%20rioting&amp;pg=5330%2C4292333 Won't you come home, Jane Jacobs?]", ''Village Voice'', 6 July 1974, pp. 1, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in Toronto==
[[File:Jane Jacobs home Toronto.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jacobs lived at 69 Albany Avenue (white porch) in Toronto's [[The Annex|Annex]] for 35 years]]
Soon after her arrest in 1968, Jacobs moved to [[Toronto]], eventually settling at 69 Albany Avenue in [[The Annex]] from 1971 until her death in 2006.&lt;ref name="Alexiou, 2006 p. 149"/&gt; She decided to leave the U.S. in part because she opposed the [[Vietnam War]], she worried about the fate of her two [[Conscription|draft]]-age sons, and she did not want to continue fighting the NYC government. She and her husband chose Toronto because it was pleasant and offered employment opportunities,&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 149–51.&lt;/ref&gt; and they moved to an area of Toronto that included so many Americans avoiding the draft it was called the "American ghetto".&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

She quickly became a leading figure in her new city and helped stop the proposed [[Spadina Expressway]]. A frequent theme of her work was to ask whether we are building cities for people or for cars. She was arrested twice during demonstrations.&lt;ref name="Allen, p. 170"/&gt; She also had considerable influence on the regeneration of the [[St. Lawrence, Toronto|St. Lawrence]] neighborhood, a [[housing project]] regarded as a major success. She became a Canadian citizen in 1974, and she later told writer [[James Howard Kunstler]] that dual citizenship was not possible at the time, implying that her U.S. citizenship was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kunstler.com/mags_jacobs2.htm |title=Interview with Jane Jacobs, part 2 |author=James Howard Kunstler |date=September 6, 2000 |accessdate=2014-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030022021/http://www.kunstler.com/mags_jacobs2.htm |archivedate=October 30, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, she offered an urbanistic perspective on [[Quebec]]'s sovereignty in her book ''The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle over Separation''. Jacobs was an advocate of a [[Proposal for the Province of Toronto|Province of Toronto]] to separate the city proper from [[Ontario]]. Jacobs said, "Cities, to thrive in the twenty-first century, must separate themselves politically from their surrounding areas."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} &lt;!-- Note: the 16 March 2010 article "Should Toronto go it alone?" in the Toronto Star is not an acceptable source, as the author may have obtained the quotation from this WP article --&gt;

She was selected to be an officer of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1996 for her seminal writings and thought-provoking commentaries on [[urban development]]. The community and urban sociology section of the [[American Sociological Association]] awarded her its Outstanding Lifetime Contribution award in 2002. In 1997, the city government of Toronto sponsored a conference entitled "Jane Jacobs: Ideas That Matter", which led to a book by the same name. At the end of the conference, the Jane Jacobs Prize was created. It includes an annual stipend of $5,000 for three years to be given to "celebrate Toronto's original, unsung heroes – by seeking out citizens who are engaged in activities that contribute to the city's vitality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideasthatmatter.com/people/jj-prize.html|title=The Jane Jacobs Prize|publisher=Ideas that Matter|accessdate=2006-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jane Jacobs and SBB.jpg|thumb|left|Jacobs with [[Ecotrust]] foreman Spencer Beebe in [[Portland, Oregon]], 2004]]
Jacobs never shied away from expressing her political support for specific candidates. She opposed the 1997 amalgamation of the cities of [[Metro Toronto]], fearing that individual neighbourhoods would have less power with the new structure. She backed an ecologist, [[Tooker Gomberg]], who lost Toronto's 2000 mayoralty race, and was an adviser to [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller's]] successful mayoral campaign in 2003, at a time when he was seen as a [[wikt:longshot|longshot]]. During the mayoral campaign, Jacobs helped lobby against the construction of a bridge to join the city waterfront to Toronto City Centre Airport (TCCA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_10.03.02/news/airport.php Eyeweekly.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830010106/http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_10.03.02/news/airport.php |date=August 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election, the Toronto city council's earlier decision to approve the bridge was reversed and bridge construction project was stopped. TCCA did upgrade the ferry service and the airport was still in operation as of 2018.  In lieu of the bridge, a pedestrian tunnel broke ground in March 2012.  The tunnel opened on July 30, 2015.

Jacobs also was active in a campaign against a plan of [[Royal St. George's College]] (an established school very close to Jacobs' residence in Toronto's Annex district) to reconfigure its facilities. Jacobs suggested not only that the redesign be stopped, but also, that the school be forced from the neighborhood entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onpha.on.ca/english/doc/places.pdf |title=Ontario Non-Profit Housing Association &amp;#124; Home |publisher=Onpha.on.ca |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2011-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001210819/http://www.onpha.on.ca/english/doc/places.pdf |archivedate=October 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Toronto council initially rejected the school's plans, the decision later was reversed – and the project was given the go-ahead by the [[Ontario Municipal Board]] (OMB) when opponents failed to produce credible witnesses and tried to withdraw from the case during the hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omb.gov.on.ca/e-decisions/pl050662_%233420.pdf Omb.gov.on.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

She also had an influence on [[Vancouver]]'s urban planning. Jacobs has been called "the mother of [[Vancouverism]]",&lt;ref name="sullivanjacobs"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.straight.com/article-702636/vancouver/sullivanism-vs-jane-jacobs | title=Vancouver's density debate pits Sullivanism versus the ideas of Jane Jacobs | publisher=The Georgia Straight | date=June 7, 2012 | accessdate=June 11, 2012 | author=Wood, Daniel | quote=She is why international experts come to Vancouver to study its renowned livability.

Jacobs died in [[Toronto Western Hospital]] aged 89, on April 25, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/arts/design/janes-walk-tours-in-honor-of-jane-jacobs-in-new-york.html|title=Jane's Walk Tours, in Honor of Jane Jacobs, in New York|last=Roberts|first=Sam|date=2012-05-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently, of a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/nettime-l@bbs.thing.net/msg03446.html|title=Urban expert Jane Jacobs dies at 89yrs|first=Sandra|last=Martin|date=2006-04-26|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] (Toronto)|accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was survived by a brother, James Butzner (d. 2009);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellsfuneralhome.com/obituary/James-Jim-Butzner/Waynesville-NC/669019|title=James Butzner Obituary, Waynesville, NC|date=May 5, 2009|work=wellsfuneralhome.com|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; her two sons, James and Ned of Vancouver,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://crowdgift.ca/team/ned-jacobs|title=Ned Jacobs|work=CrowdGift.com|access-date=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a daughter, Burgin Jacobs; by two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

==Legacy==
Jacobs is credited, along with [[Lewis Mumford]], with inspiring the [[New Urbanism|New Urbanist]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Bernstein, "[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2004-08-15/jane-jacobs-sticking-up-for-cities Jane Jacobs: Sticking Up For Cities]", ''Business Week'', 15 August 2004; accessed 28 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She has been characterized as a major influence on [[Decentralization|decentralist]] &lt;ref&gt;Hannum, Hildegarde, ed. (1997). ''People, Land, and Community''. Introduction by Nancy Jack Todd. E. F. Schumacher Society, pp.&amp;nbsp;8 and 105–06.  {{ISBN|978-0-300-07173-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] thought.&lt;ref&gt;Satin, Mark (2004). ''Radical Middle: The Politics We Need Now''. Westview Press and Basic Books, p.&amp;nbsp;30. {{ISBN|978-0-8133-4190-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She discussed her legacy in an interview with ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason magazine]]''.

{{quote|text = 
'''''Reason''''': What do you think you'll be remembered for most? You were the one who stood up to the federal bulldozers and the urban renewal people and said they were destroying the lifeblood of these cities. Is that what it will be?

'''Jacobs''': No. If I were to be remembered as a really important thinker of the century, the most important thing I've contributed is my discussion of what makes economic expansion happen. This is something that has puzzled people always. I think I've figured out what it is.

Expansion and development are two different things. Development is differentiation of what already existed. Practically every new thing that happens is a differentiation of a previous thing, from a new shoe sole to changes in legal codes. Expansion is an actual growth in size or volume of activity. That is a different thing.

I've gone at it two different ways. Way back when I wrote ''The Economy of Cities'', I wrote about import replacing and how that expands, not just the economy of the place where it occurs, but economic life altogether. As a city replaces imports, it shifts its imports. It doesn't import less. And yet it has everything it had before.

'''''Reason''''': It's not a zero-sum game. It's a bigger, growing pie.

'''Jacobs''': That's the actual mechanism of it. The theory of it is what I explain in ''The Nature of Economies''. I equate it to what happens with biomass, the sum total of all flora and fauna in an area. The energy, the material that's involved in this, doesn't just escape the community as an export. It continues being used in a community, just as in a rainforest the waste from certain organisms and various plants and animals gets used by other ones in the place.|author=Jane Jacobs|source="City Views: Urban studies legend Jane Jacobs on gentrification, the New Urbanism, and her legacy", ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', June 2001, Interviewer: Bill Steigerwald}}

While Jacobs saw her greatest legacy to be her contributions to economic theory, it is in the realm of urban planning that she has had her most extensive impact. Her observations about the ways in which cities function revolutionized the urban planning profession and discredited many accepted planning models that dominated mid-century planning.&lt;ref name=Klemek_2011&gt;Klemek, Christopher (2011). [https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/dead-or-alive-at-fifty-reading-jane-jacobs-on-her-golden-anniversary  Dead or Alive at Fifty? Reading Jane Jacobs on her Golden Anniversary]. ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent Magazine]]'', Spring 2011, Vol. 58, No. 2, pp. 75–79&lt;/ref&gt; The influential Harvard Economist [[Edward Glaeser]], known for his work on urban studies, acknowledged&lt;ref name=Glaeser_2007-01-19&gt;[[Edward Glaeser|Glaeser, Edward L.]] (2007) [http://www.nysun.com/arts/great-cities-need-great-builders/47012/ Great Cities Need Great Builders], ''[[The New York Sun]]'', January 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; that Jane Jacobs (1960s) had been prescient in attacking Moses for "replacing well-functioning neighborhoods with [[Le Corbusier]]-inspired towers." Glaeser agreed that these housing projects proved to be Moses' greatest failures, "Moses spent millions and evicted tens of thousands to create buildings that became centers of crime, poverty, and despair."&lt;ref name=Glaeser_2007-01-19/&gt;

She also was famous for introducing concepts such as the "Ballet of the Sidewalk" and "Eyes on the Street", a reference to what would later be known as [[natural surveillance]]. The concept had a huge influence on planners and architects such as Oscar Newman, who operationalized the idea through a series of studies that would culminate in his [[defensible space theory]]. Jacobs's and Newman's work would go on to affect American housing policy through the [[HOPE VI]] Program, an effort by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] to demolish the high-rise public housing projects so reviled by Jacobs, and to replace them with low-rise, [[mixed-income housing]].

Throughout her life, she fought to alter the way in which city development was approached. By arguing that cities were living beings and ecosystems, she advocated ideas such as "mixed use" development and bottom-up planning. Furthermore, her harsh criticisms of "slum clearing" and "high-rise housing" projects were instrumental in discrediting these once universally-supported planning practices.&lt;ref name="DMartin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howe, R (2005) 'The Spirit of Melbourne: 1960s Urban Activism in Inner-City Melbourne' in Seamus O'Hanlon and Tanja Luckins (Eds) Go! Melbourne in the Sixties, Circa: Beaconsfield, pp. 218–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs is remembered as being an advocate for the mindful development of cities,&lt;ref&gt;Lang &amp; Wunsch, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and for leaving "a legacy of empowerment for citizens to trust their common sense and become advocates for their place".&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, A. and Elizabeth, L. (2010) What We See: Advancing the Observations of Jane Jacobs, New Village Press: Oakland, California&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that Jacobs mainly focused on New York, her arguments have been identified as universal.&lt;ref name="Lang, G 2009"&gt;Lang, G. and Wunsch, M. (2009) Genius of Common Sense: Jane Jacobs and the Story of the Death and Life of Great American Cities, David R. Godine: New York&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, her opposition against the demolition of urban neighbourhoods for projects of urban renewal had "special resonance" in [[Melbourne]], Australia.&lt;ref name="Howe, R 2005"&gt;Howe, R (2005) 'The Spirit of Melbourne: 1960s Urban Activism in Inner-City Melbourne' in Seamus O'Hanlon and Tanja Luckins (Eds) Go! Melbourne in the Sixties, Circa: Beaconsfield, pp. 218–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In Melbourne in the 1960s, resident associations fought against large-scale high-rise housing projects of the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]], which they argued had little regard for the impact on local communities.&lt;ref name="Howe, R 2005"/&gt;

Jacobs fought an uphill battle against dominant trends of planning despite the United States remaining very much a suburban nation,&lt;ref name=Klemek_2011/&gt; the work of Jacobs has contributed to city living being rehabilitated and revitalized. Because of her ideas, today, many distressed urban neighbourhoods are more likely to be [[gentrification|gentrified]] than cleared for redevelopment.&lt;ref name=Klemek_2011/&gt;

{{quote|text = It may be that we have become so feckless as a people that we no longer care how things do work, but only what kind of quick, easy outer impression they give. If so, there is little hope for our cities or probably for much else in our society. But I do not think this is so.|author=Jane Jacobs|source=''The Death And Life of Great American Cities'', 1961}}

{{quote|text = In her book 'Death and Life of Great American Cities,' written in 1961, Ms. Jacobs's enormous achievement was to transcend her own withering critique of 20th-century urban planning and propose radically new principles for rebuilding cities. At a time when both common and inspired wisdom called for bulldozing slums and opening up city space, Ms. Jacobs's prescription was ever more diversity, density and dynamism – in effect, to crowd people and activities together in a jumping, joyous urban jumble.|author=Douglas Martin|source=''The New York Times'', April 25, 2006}}

[[Samuel R. Delany]]'s book ''[[Times Square Red, Times Square Blue]]'' relies heavily on ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' in its analysis of the nature of social relations within the realm of urban studies.

===Jane Jacobs Days===
After Jacobs' death in April 2006, New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] announced a Jane Jacobs Day, held on June 28, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The City of Toronto proclaimed her birthday the following year, May 4, 2007, as Jane Jacobs Day.

===Jane's Walks===
[[File:Janes Walk Fort York.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Jane's Walk]] group pauses at [[Fort York|Fort York National Historic Site]] in Toronto]]
In connection with Jane Jacobs Day in Toronto, two dozen free neighborhood walks in the city were offered that weekend (May 5, 2007) as an active memorial to Jacobs, and were dubbed [[Jane's Walk]]s. A Jane's Walk event was later held in New York on September 29 and 30, 2007. In 2008, the event spread to eight cities and towns throughout Canada, and by 2016, Jane's Walks were taking place in 212 cities in 36 countries, on six continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janeswalk.org/information/cities/|title=Add a City - Jane's Walk|author=|date=|work=[[Jane's Walk]]|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretive walks typically apply ideas Jacobs identified or espoused to local areas, which are explored on foot and sometimes by bicycle. The walks normally take place in early May, on or close to her May 4 birthday. Walks are organized and led by local volunteers, coordinated by a headquarters office in Toronto. There are more than 200 walks offered in Toronto, alone, in 2016, taking place May 6, 7 and 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janeswalk.org/canada/toronto|title=Toronto, ON - Jane's Walk|author=|date=|work=Jane's Walk|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibitions===
In 2016, to mark the 100th anniversary of Jacobs' birth, a Toronto gallery is staging "Jane at Home", an exhibition running from April 29 to May 8. Curated by Jane's son, Jim Jacobs, it offers glimpses of her home life, where she also worked. Her Toronto living room is represented, based on the one at her Albany Avenue house in [[The Annex]], where she often spoke with noted thinkers and political leaders including [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Paul Martin]], and the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Queen of the Netherlands]]. On display are her typewriter, original manuscripts, rediscovered photographs demonstrating her distinctive styles,&lt;ref&gt;Lange, Alexandra, ''[http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/jane-jacobs-georgia-okeeffe-and-the-power-of-the-marimekko-dress Jane Jacobs, Georgia O’Keeffe, and the Power of the Marimekko Dress]'', The New Yorker, June 23, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and personal mementos. The exhibit includes furniture from previous homes in New York (her dining room is set up) and from Scranton, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/2016/04/08/toronto-gallery-shows-how-jane-jacobs-lived-and-worked-at-home Toronto gallery shows how Jane Jacobs lived and worked at home], Toronto Sun, April 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbanspacegallery.ca/exhibits/jane-home Jane at Home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505144334/http://www.urbanspacegallery.ca/exhibits/jane-home |date=2016-05-05 }}, Urbanspace Gallery, Toronto, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Municipal Art Society]] of New York partnered with the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to host an exhibit focusing on "Jane Jacobs and the Future of New York," which opened at the society in September that year. The exhibit aimed to educate the public on her writings and activism and used tools to encourage new generations to become active in issues involving their own neighborhoods. An accompanying exhibit publication includes essays and articles by such architecture critics, artists, activists, and journalists as [[Malcolm Gladwell]], [[Reverend Billy]], [[Robert Neuwirth]], [[Tom Wolfe]], [[Thomas de Monchaux]], and [[William McDonough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=urbancenterbooks.org |url=http://www.urbancenterbooks.org/jane_jacobs.html |title=Jane Jacobs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927151653/http://www.urbancenterbooks.org/jane_jacobs.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these contributors participated in a series of panel discussions on "Jane Jacobs and the Future of New York".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.org/images/media/original/JJMedalists.pdf |title=Rockefeller Foundation news advisory |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607213026/http://www.mas.org/images/media/original/JJMedalists.pdf |archivedate=June 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jane Jacobs Medal===
As a tribute to Jacobs, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], which had awarded Jacobs grants in the 1950s and 1960s, announced on February 9, 2007, the creation of the '''Jane Jacobs Medal''', "to recognize individuals who have made a significant contribution to thinking about [[urban design]], specifically in New York City".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/48375/ The Jane Jacobs Medal Created by Rockefeller], [[The New York Sun]], Feb. 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Recipients:

Jacobs is the subject of the 2017 movie [[Citizen Jane (2017 film)|Citizen Jane: Battle for the City]] [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/movies/citizen-jane-battle-for-the-city-review.html (NYT review)], which depicts her victories over Robert Moses and her philosophy of urban design.

==Criticism==
The planners and developers she fought in order to preserve the [[West Village]] were among those who initially criticised her ideas. [[Robert Moses]] has generally been identified as her archrival during this period. Since then, Jacobs' ideas have been analysed many times, often in regard to the outcomes that their influences have produced.&lt;ref name=Klemek_2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Glaeser_2010-05-04&gt;[[Edward Glaeser|Glaeser, Edward L.]] (2010) [https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/taller-buildings-cheaper-homes/ Taller Buildings, Cheaper Homes].

''[[Literary Review of Canada]]'', October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In places such as the West Village, the factors that she argued would maintain economic and cultural diversity have led instead to [[gentrification]] and some of the most expensive real estate in the world. Her family's conversion of an old candy shop into a home is an example of the gentrifying trend that would continue under the influence of Jacobs's ideas.&lt;ref name=Klemek_2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Glaeser_2010-05-04/&gt;

Gentrification also was caused, however, by "the completely unexpected influx of affluent residents back into the inner city".&lt;ref name=Klemek_2011/&gt; The extent to which her ideas facilitated this phenomenon was at the time unimaginable. For example, she advocated the preservation of older buildings specifically because their lack of economic value made them affordable for poor people. In this respect, she saw them as "guarantors of social diversity" (Klemek, 2011:76). That many of these older structures have increased in economic value solely due to their age was implausible in 1961. Issues of gentrification have dominated criticism of Jane Jacobs' planning ideas.&lt;ref name=Ouroussoff_2006-04-30/&gt;

Her concepts have also been criticized more broadly. Economist [[Tyler Cowen]] has criticized her ideas for not addressing problems of scale or infrastructure, and suggests that economists disagree with some of her approaches to development.&lt;ref name=W/&gt; For example, although her ideas of planning were praised at times as "universal",&lt;ref name="Lang, G 2009"/&gt; they are now thought inapplicable when a city grows from one million to ten million (as has happened many times in developing nations). Such arguments suggest that the ideas apply only to cities with similar issues to those of New York, where Jacobs developed many of her ideas.

==Works==
Jane Jacobs spent her life studying cities. Her books include:

===''The Death and Life of Great American Cities''===
{{main|The Death and Life of Great American Cities}}
''The Death and Life of Great American Cities'' is her single-most influential book and possibly the most influential book on urban planning and cities. Published in 1961, this book was widely read by both planning professionals and the general public; the book is a strong critique of the urban renewal policies of the 1950s, which, she claimed, destroyed communities and created isolated, unnatural urban spaces. Jacobs advocated the abolition of zoning laws and restoration of free markets in land, which would result in dense, mixed-use neighborhoods and frequently cited New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] as an example of a vibrant urban community.

[[Robert Caro]] has cited it as the strongest influence on ''[[The Power Broker]]'', his [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]-winning biography of Robert Moses, though Caro does not mention Jacobs by name even once in the book despite Jacobs' battles with Moses over his proposed [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]]. Caro reportedly cut a chapter about Jacobs due to his book's length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oder|first1=Norman|title=The Missing Jane Jacobs Chapter in The Power Broker|url=http://atlanticyardsreport.blogspot.com/2007/10/missing-jane-jacobs-chapter-in-power.html|website=atlanticyardsreport.blogspot.com|accessdate=9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the practical lessons in city design and planning that ''Death and Life'' offers, the theoretical underpinnings of the work challenge the modern development mindset. Jane Jacobs defends her positions with common sense and anecdotes.

===''The Economy of Cities''===
The thesis of this book is that cities are the primary drivers of economic development. Her main argument is that explosive economic growth derives from urban [[import replacement]]. Import replacement occurs when a city begins to produce goods locally that it formerly imported, e.g., Tokyo bicycle factories replacing Tokyo bicycle importers in the 1800s. Jacobs claims that import replacement builds up local infrastructure, skills, and production. Jacobs also claims that the increased production is subsequently exported to other cities, giving those other cities a new opportunity to engage in import replacement, thus producing a positive cycle of growth.

In an interview with Bill Steigerwald in ''[[Reason Magazine]]'', Jacobs said that if she is remembered for being a great intellectual she will be remembered not for her work concerning city planning, but for the discovery of [[import replacement]]. Critics erroneously claim that her ideas parrot the idea of [[import substitution industrialization|import substitution]] advanced earlier by scholars such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]]. Import substitution was a national economic theory implying that if a nation substituted its imports with national production the nation would become wealthier, whereas Jacob's idea is entirely about cities and could be called urban import substitution. However, even this would lead to confusion since in practice, import substitution in India and Latin America were government subsidized and mandated, whereas Jacobs' concept of import replacement is a free market process of discovery and division of labor within a city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2001/06/01/city-views|title=City Views|work=Reason.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second part of the book Jacobs argues that cities preceded agriculture. She argues that in cities trade in wild animals and grains allowed for the initial division of labor necessary for the discovery of husbandry and agriculture; these discoveries then moved out of the city due to land competition. Another interpretation of history, generally and erroneously considered to be contradictory to Jacobs' is supported by Marxist archaeologist [[Vere Gordon Childe]] and in recent times by another historical materialist [[Charles Keith Maisels]]&lt;ref&gt;Maisels, Charles Keith, 1990, The Emergence of Civilisation: From Hunting and Gathering to Agriculture, Cities, and the State in the Near East. Routledge, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Soja, Edward W. 2000, Postmetropolis, Putting Cities First, Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell pg.24&lt;/ref&gt; These writers argue that agriculture preceded cities. The apparent opposition between Childe and Jacobs theories rests in their definition of 'city,' 'civilization,' or 'urban.' Childe, like other materialists such as Maisels or [[Henri Lefebvre]] defines 'urban' or 'civilization' as [[Synoecism]]—as a literate, socially stratified, monolithic political community,&lt;ref&gt;Soja, Edward W. 2000, Postmetropolis, Putting Cities First, Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt; whereas, as one can see from ''The Economy of Cities'' or from ''Cities and the Wealth of Nations'', Jacobs defines the city purely along the lines of geographically dense trade giving way to entrepreneurial discovery and subsequent improvements in the division of labor. Without the requirements of literacy, monumental building, or the signs of specialized civil and armed forces, 'cities' can be accurately be interpreted to exists thousands of years before when Childe and Maisels place them. However, Jacobs' definition is supposition, since 'city' is defined simply as a large town or "a large human settlement" indicating permanence. The earliest remains of mankind uncovered by archaeologists do not give us more information other than they were hunter-gatherers as there is no evidence yet of farming or settlement, implying nomadic lifestyles until further discoveries are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=bradshawfoundation.com|title=Discovery of Earliest Homo Sapien Skulls backs 'Out of Africa' Theory|first=Clive|last=Cookson|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/herto_skulls.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle over Sovereignty''===

''The Question of Separatism'' incorporated and expanded Jacobs' presentation of the 1979 [[Massey Lectures]], entitled ''Canadian Cities and Sovereignty-Association''. It was published in 1980 and reprinted in 2011 with a previously-unpublished 2005 interview with [[Robin Philpot]] on the subject in which she evokes the relative overlooking of that book among her usual readership. This was in fact the first time she was requested to discuss it in an interview. Columnist [[Richard Gwyn]] advanced that while not openly criticizing her, English-speaking Canadians readers thought she did not understood how Canadian politics worked and that she was not being helpful in a time of distress for national unity (the [[Quebec referendum, 1980|1980 referendum]] was just defeated by a vote of 60%). ''The Question of Separatism'' was also not mentioned in the bibliography of her 2006 obituary in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Philpot |first1=Robin |last2= |first2=|page=X |date=|chapter=Preface to the 2011 edition |title=Jane Jacobs, The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle over Sovereignty|trans-title= |url= |language= |location= |publisher=Baraka Books |isbn= |year=2011|subscription= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs' book advances the view that [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec's eventual independence]] is best for [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], the rest of [[Canada]], and the world; and that such independence can be achieved peacefully. As precedent, she cites [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden|Norway's secession from Sweden]] and how it enriched both nations. The origins of the contemporary secessionist-movement in the [[Quiet Revolution]] are examined, along with Canada's historical reliance on [[natural resources]] and foreign-owned manufacturing for its own [[economic development]]. Jacobs asserts that such an approach is colonial and hence backward, citing by example Canada buying its [[skis]] and furniture from Norway or Norwegian-owned factories in Canada, the latter procedure being a product of Canadian [[tariff]]s designed specifically to foster such factories. The relevant public views of [[René Lévesque]], [[Claude Ryan]], and then [[Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau|Pierre Trudeau]] are also critically analyzed, an example being their failure to recognize that two respective, independent [[Currency|currencies]] are essential to the success of an independent Quebec and a smaller resultant Canada, an issue that is central to her book. Jacobs stresses the need for Montreal to continue developing its leadership of [[Québécois (word)|Québécois]] culture, but that such a need can ultimately never be fulfilled by Montreal's increasing tendencies toward [[regional]]-city status, tendencies foretelling economic, political, and cultural subservience to English-speaking Toronto. Such an outcome, Jacobs believed, would in the long run doom Quebec's independence as much as it would hinder Canada's own future. She concludes with her observation that the popular equating of political secession with political and economic failure is the result of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which perceived [[nature]] as a force for "standardization, uniformity, universality, and immutability." Since then, naturalists and their readers have gradually realized that nature is a force for diversity, and that, "diversity itself is of the essence of excellence." The right kind of secession, Jacobs states, can lead to the right kind of diversity, and Quebec and Canada are capable of both, and must achieve both, to survive.

===''Cities and the Wealth of Nations''===
''[[Cities and the Wealth of Nations]]'' attempts to do for economics what ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' did for modern urban planning, though it has not received the same critical attention. Beginning with a concise treatment of classical economics, this book challenges one of the fundamental assumptions of the greatest economists. Classical (and Neo-classical) economists consider the nation-state to be the main player in [[macroeconomics]]. Jacobs argues that it is not the nation-state, rather it is the city which is the true player in this worldwide game. She restates the idea of import replacement from her earlier book ''[[The Economy of Cities]]'', while speculating on the further ramifications of considering the city first and the nation second, or not at all.

===''Systems of Survival''===
{{main|Systems of Survival}}

''Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics'' moves outside of the city, studying the [[moral]] underpinnings of [[labour (economics)|work]]. As with her other work, she used an observational approach. This book is written as a [[Plato|Platonic dialogue]]. It appears that she (as described by characters in her book) took newspaper clippings of moral judgments related to work, collected and sorted them to find that they fit two patterns of moral behaviour that were mutually exclusive. She calls these two patterns "Moral Syndrome A", or commercial moral syndrome, and "Moral Syndrome B", or guardian moral syndrome. She claims that the commercial moral syndrome is applicable to business owners, scientists, farmers, and traders. Similarly, she claims that the guardian moral syndrome is applicable to government, charities, hunter-gatherers, and religious institutions. She also claims that these Moral Syndromes are fixed, and do not fluctuate over time.

It is important to stress that Jane Jacobs is providing a theory about the morality of work, and not all moral ideas. Moral ideas that are not included in her syndrome are applicable to both syndromes.

Jane Jacobs goes on to describe what happens when these two moral syndromes are mixed, showing the work underpinnings of the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] and communism, and what happens when [[New York City Subway|New York subway]] Police are paid bonuses here – reinterpreted slightly as a part of the larger analysis.

===''The Nature of Economies''===
''The Nature of Economies'', a dialog between friends concerning the premise: "human beings exist wholly within nature as part of the natural order in every respect" (p. ''ix''), argues that the same principles underlie both [[ecosystem]]s and [[economic system|economies]]: "development and co-development through differentiations and their combinations; expansion through diverse, multiple uses of energy; and self-maintenance through self-refueling" (p.&amp;nbsp;82).

Jacobs' characters discuss the four methods by which "dynamically stable systems" may evade collapse: "bifurcations; [[positive feedback|positive-feedback loops]]; [[negative feedback|negative-feedback controls]]; and emergency adaptations" (p.&amp;nbsp;86). Their conversations also cover the "double nature of fitness for survival" (traits to avoid destroying one's own habitat as well as success in competition to feed and breed, p.&amp;nbsp;119), and unpredictability including the [[butterfly effect]] characterized in terms of multiplicity of variables as well as disproportional response to cause, and [[self-organization]] where "a system can be making itself up as it goes along" (p.&amp;nbsp;137).

Through the dialogue, Jacobs' characters explore and examine the similarities between the functioning of ecosystems and economies. Topics include environmental and economic development, growth and expansion, and how economies and environments keep themselves alive through "self-refueling." Jacobs also comments on the nature of economic and biological diversity and its role in the development and growth of the two kinds of systems.

The book is infused with many real-world economic and biological examples, which help keep the book "down to earth" and comprehensible, if dense. Concepts are furnished with both economic and biological examples, showing their coherence in both worlds.

One particularly interesting insight is the creation of "something from nothing" – an economy from nowhere. In the biological world, free energy is given through sunlight, but in the economic world human creativity and natural resources supply this free energy, or at least starter energy. Another interesting insight is the creation of economic diversity through the combination of different technologies, for example the typewriter and television as inputs and outputs of a computer system: this can lead to the creation of "new species of work".

===''Dark Age Ahead''===
{{main|Dark Age Ahead}}

Published in 2004 by Random House, ''Dark Age Ahead'' posits Jacobs' argument that "North American" civilization shows signs of a spiral decline comparable to the collapse of the Roman empire. Her discussion focuses on "five pillars of our culture that we depend on to stand firm," which can be summarized as the nuclear family and community; quality in education; free thought in science; representational government and responsible taxes; and corporate and professional accountability. As the book's title suggests, Jacobs' outlook is far more pessimistic than that of her previous works. However, in the conclusion she admits: "At a given time it is hard to tell whether forces of cultural life or death are in the ascendancy. Is suburban sprawl, with its murders of communities and wastes of land, time, and energy, a sign of decay? Or is rising interest in means of overcoming sprawl a sign of vigor and adaptability in North American culture? Arguably, either could turn out to be true."&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Laurence (2005) "Dark Age Ahead? Jane Jacobs' Latest Book in Context," Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 64 (Mar. 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Publisher's Weekly (October 1999) said in ''Her Own Terms'' Grossman achieved a balance of deadpan wit and understated emotion. Grossman depicts a generation of transatlantic post-war English drifters in the early '60s.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For many years, the event was arranged as a joint project with students of the Higher School of Pedagogy (Wyższa Szkoła Pedagogiczna) under the name of ‘Żakinada’. As a result of the merger of the above schools into the University of Warmia and Mazury, Kortowiada grew rich with respect to its special party schedule.
The annual event attracts more than 10 thousand of students from all over the country and hundreds of bands – Kortowiada is nowadays one of the most important student-related music events in Poland.

==General Kortowiada schedule==

The whole event lasts for a couple of days. The official opening ceremony is synonymous with returning the key to the city to students by the authorities of Olsztyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Returning key to the city to students|url=http://olsztyn.gosc.pl/doc/2480659.Kortowiada-wystartowala|agency=05/13/2015|accessdate=2016-05-05|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kudos''' is a [[career planning]]  [[computer program]] used mostly in schools for young people deciding on their career choices and what qualifications they may need for particular career paths. It is designed primarily for use in the [[United Kingdom]], and is used by public and government-operated schools. It is aimed at students aged 13–20 years. The Kudos software is available online formats. It is one of a range of career resources produced by [[CASCAiD]], a [[Loughborough University]] company.

==Overview==
Young people answer a set of 50 questions, followed by a further 67 questions should the user wish to do so. The responses for each question could be one of five answers: dislike very much, dislike, does not matter, like and like very much. This will then give the person a list of careers that match their preferences from the questions. They can then click on these careers and it will enable them to look at the aspects of the career and the qualifications needed for it.

{{redirects here|LOTE|other uses|Lote (disambiguation)}}
'''LOTE''' or '''Languages Other Than English''' is the name given to language subjects, other than English, at [[Australian]], [[New York City|New York]], and other schools. The name evolved from '[[heritage language]]', a term first used to refer to languages other than French and English in Canada.  Later modified in relation to Australia to refer to languages other than English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Kendall A.|last2=Ennser-Kananen|first2=Johanna|title=Heritage Languages and Language Policy|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277698847_Heritage_Languages_and_Language_Policy|accessdate=July 1, 2016|doi=10.1002/9781405198431.wbeal0500|date=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; LOTEs have often historically been related to the policy of [[multiculturalism]], and tend to reflect the predominant non-English languages spoken in a school's local area, the idea being to play a part in the maintenance of cultural identities in local communities.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

'''LOTE''' is also used to describe written material presented in languages other than English.&lt;ref name="ala"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultivating Non-English Collections: a unique partnership that alleviates the pain of librarians in multi-language communities {{!}} Offices of the American Library Association|url=http://www.ala.org/offices/iro/iroactivities/cultivatingnonenglish|website=www.ala.org|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== LOTE in Australia ==
'''LOTE''' is becoming an increasingly popular subject in Australian Schools. The Draft Shape of the Australian Curriculum: Languages, produced by ACARA, has suggested three tiers of languages to be taught in Australian schools:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Tier 1 !! Tier 2 !! Tier 3
|-
| [[Italian language|Italian]] || [[Japanese language|Japanese]] || [[Standard Arabic|Arabic]]
|-
| [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] || [[French language|French]] || [[Greek language|Modern Greek]]
|-
|  || [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] || [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]
|-
|  || [[Korean language|Korean]] || 
|-
|  || [[Hindi]]  || 
|-
|  || [[Bengali language|Bengali]]  ||
|-
|  || [[German language|German]] || 
|-
|  || [[Spanish language|Spanish]] || 
|}

Tier 1 languages were chosen because they cater for the needs of the greatest number of students. Italian is learnt by the most number of students and Chinese is a national priority.

Tier 2 languages were chosen because French, Japanese, Indonesian and German are some of the most frequently taught languages in Australian schools, Indonesian, Japanese and Korean are national priorities and Spanish "is a language of global importance".

Tier 3 languages were chosen because Arabic, Modern Greek and Vietnamese are the most frequently spoken foreign languages in Australian homes, and Arabic "is a language of global importance".

'''Frances Louise "Lu" Parker''' (born April 16, 1968) is an American [[journalist]], [[Miss USA 1994]] winner, [[animal rights]] advocate, and [[author]].&lt;ref name="luparker"/&gt;

== Early life ==
Born in [[Anderson, South Carolina]], Parker attended the [[College of Charleston]], where she was a sister of [[Alpha Delta Pi]] and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and was later named Alumnus of the Year.  She then went on to receive a Master of Arts in Education from [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]].&lt;ref name="luparkerbio"/&gt;

After graduating, Parker taught English Literature at North Charleston High School. Lu has been presented with the Palmetto Award, the highest civilian honor given in the state of South Carolina, and has been recognized in the South Carolina Congressional Record twice as an outstanding South Carolinian.&lt;ref name="luparkerbio"/&gt;

Her first television broadcasting job was for [[WCSC-TV]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where she was an education reporter and fill-in anchor.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

==Pageantry==
After winning [[Miss South Carolina USA]], Parker competed at [[Miss USA 1994]]. She came into the semi-finals in first place, having won all three preliminary competitions. After the semi-finals, she went into the Top 6 in second place. After the judges' question, she just made the cut in the final three in third place, eventually becoming the third South Carolinian to be crowned Miss USA. She continued on to compete in the 1994 [[Miss Universe 1994|Miss Universe]] Pageant in Manila, Philippines, where she placed among the top 6 finalists.&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt;

In 2016, she was one of the judges at the [[Miss Teen USA 2016]] pageant, at The Venetian Theatre, [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Parker has authored a book on pageantry titled ''Catching the Crown: The Source for Pageant Competition''.

==Career==

===Communications career===
In San Antonio, [[KABB]] TV hired Parker to serve as a weekend anchor and reporter.  Parker was promoted to main anchor in 2000.  In February 2003, she became the host for "Great Day SA", which is San Antonio's top-rated live entertainment morning show. 

===KTLA===
In January 2005, she moved to Los Angeles to join [[Frank Buckley (broadcaster)|Frank Buckley]] as co-anchor for [[KTLA]]'s "KTLA Prime News" on weekends. In 2007, Parker began to co-anchor the weekday "KTLA Morning News" at 5:00 A.M and 6:00 A.M. with [[Cher Calvin]]. Parker has been the anchor for the 1p and 3p newscasts at KTLA since 2015. She has won multiple Emmy Awards for her work.&lt;ref name="luparkerbio"/&gt;

Parker has made appearances on "[[Larry King Live]]" and [[E!]] Entertainment Television. She has acted in some films and television shows, most often as a news anchor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1951721/|title=Lu Parker - IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, she partnered with Maria Shriver and KTLA creating an inspirational webshow titled The Path with Lu Parker.&lt;ref name="luparkerpath"/&gt;

== Personal ==
Parker began a relationship with [[Antonio Villaraigosa]], Mayor of [[Los Angeles]], in March 2009. Her employer, KTLA, was reportedly unaware of this fact until May 2009. Parker reported several stories on Villaraigosa prior to publicly revealing her relationship with him. Villaraigosa and Parker split in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/02/antonio-villaraigosa-lu-parker-split_n_1644861.html|title=Antonio Villaraigosa, Lu Parker Split (PHOTOS)|first=Anna|last=Almendrala|date=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incident at LAX===
On November 2, 2016 Parker was arrested at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX) after taking a pair of earbuds which did not belong to her from a TSA security checkpoint.  The earbuds belonged to a Los Angeles Police Department detective who later placed Parker under private person's arrest, as she was not on-duty.  Parker explained her actions by saying she was going to try and find the owner, but when she couldn't find the rightful owner she decided to board her flight with the earbuds still in her possession.

Los Angeles World Airports police officers later boarded the flight before the door was closed and removed Parker from the plane.  She was later booked and charged with theft.  Parker later agreed to enter a diversion program with the Los Angeles city attorney's office which will allow her to avoid being convicted, pleading guilty or even having a criminal record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KTLA news anchor Lu Parker arrested at LAX on suspicion of petty theft|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lu-parker-arrested-20161102-story.html|date=November 2, 2016|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first1=Veronica|last1=Rocha|first2=Richard|last2=Winton}}&lt;/ref&gt; No charges were filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KTLA news anchor Lu Parker will not be charged with theft if she completes diversion program, officials say|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 16, 2016|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lu-parker-20161216-story.html|first1=Hailey|last1=Branson-Potts|first2=Matt|last2=Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal advocacy===
In 2010, Parker founded the Lu Parker project,&lt;ref name="luparkerproject"/&gt; whose stated mission is to "improve the lives of at-risk youth and homeless animals through direct service, education, and advocacy."

She got the nickname from a younger cousin who used it in referring to Ms. Parker. The nickname stuck among just family at first, then spreading to use among close friends.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2387">==Origins and Purpose==
The Microelectronic Education Support Unit (MESU) was announced in 1985 as a follow on to the [[Microelectronics Education Programme]] however it did not become operational until January 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Fothergill (1988) Implications of New Technology for the School Curriculum (London, Kogan Page) page 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff==
MESU was set up by its newly appointed Director John Foster at the Warwick University Science Park.  He appointed [[Ralph Tabberer]] and Ann Irving as Deputy Directors and they recruited a strong team of curriculum and information specialists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edtechhistory.org.uk/history/the_1980s/mesu.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It set about identifying local authority needs and linking into subject associations.

==Supporting Advisory Teachers==
In 1988 the Department for Education and Science (DES) set up the Information Technology in Schools (ITIS) initiative to oversee this area, headed by Phillip Lewis and supported by David Noble. It funded the deployment of 600 advisory teachers and the provision of hardware in schools through the payment of Education Support Grants (ESGs) to local authorities. Grants were made conditional on each LEA producing a policy statement and a five-year plan.  MESU ran separate national conferences for the different subject advisory teachers, Mathematics, English, Science, Design and Technology and others. pulling together a resource pack for each to provide each with support in their local authority work. 
Some of National Curriculum History&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmchilsch/344/344i.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Curriculum==
Following legislation in 1988 schools had become more autonomous in making their own purchasing and staffing decisions. Of substantial importance was the inclusion of IT as a key component of the national curriculum for every student aged 5 to 16. This identified for the first time a core set of IT capabilities and stressed applying them across the curriculum.

==Merger with CET to form NCET==
In 1988 MESU was merged with the [[Council for Educational Technology|CET]] by the DES, who funded both bodies, to form the [[National Council for Educational Technology]].

'''Muriel Myee Steinbeck'''&lt;ref name ="Australian Dictionary of Biography"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/steinbeck/muriel/myee-15546/text26758.html |title=Muriel Myee Steinbeck |publisher=adb |date= 2012 |accessdate=16 February 2015 |author=Sally O,Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; (21 July 1913 – 20 July 1982) was an Australian actress who worked extensively in radio, theatre, television and film. She is best known for her performance as the wife of Sir [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] in ''[[Smithy (1946 film)|Smithy]]'' (1946) and for playing the lead role in ''[[Autumn Affair]]'' (1958–59), Australia's first television serial.

==Biography ==
===Early life===
The youngest of the four children of William Martin Steinbeck and Lily Clarissa (née Batten), Muriel Steinbeck was born in [[Broken Hill, New South Wales]], where her father was working as a headmaster.

Her family left Broken Hill when Muriel was five. She was educated at Newcastle and [[Sydney Girls High School|Sydney Girls High]] (1926–30), and when the family moved to Sydney she became involved in amateur theatre, appearing in plays such as ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''Exit John Barcombe'' and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and becoming renowned for her performances in comedy and drama.

She was seen in a production of ''Where the Crash Comes'' by [[Lawrence H. Cecil]] of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]. He hired her to do radio drama and her career was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article127294808 |title=Film Lead for Girl From Barrier |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]] |volume=44 |issue=6,719 |location=Adelaide |date=10 February 1945 |accessdate=30 April 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minerva===
Steinbeck began appearing on the stage regularly at the Minerva Theatre in Kings Cross. She was in such productions as ''Spring Tide'' (1941), ''Claudia'' (1942), ''Watch on the Rhine'' (1942), ''Janie'' (1943), and ''[[The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse]]'' (1943).

===Films===
Steinbeck made her film debut in a wartime propaganda short, ''[[Eleventh Hour (1942 documentary film)|Eleventh Hour]]'' (1942), directed by [[Ken G. Hall]]. Hall then used her in another short, ''[[South West Pacific (film)|South West Pacific]]'' (1943).

Steinbeck made her her feature film  debut in ''[[A Son Is Born]]'' (1946), a melodrama where she played the lead role, a woman who marries unhappily (to [[Peter Finch]]), and has an ungrateful son (played by [[Ron Randell]]). Its release was delayed to take advantage of publicity for her second film, ''[[Smithy (1946 film)|Smithy]]'', directed by Hall, a biopic of [[Charles Kingsford-Smith]] (played by Randell) where Steinbeck played his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article78823380 |title=Star hit as Smithy's wife |newspaper=[[The Daily News]] |volume=LXIV |issue=22,103 |location=Western Australia |date=9 February 1946 |accessdate=30 April 2018 |page=27 (First Edition) |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a big commercial success but Australia made so few films at the time Steinbeck focused on radio and theatre work.

She continued to work at the Minerva, appearing in ''Dangerous Corner'' (1946), ''The Third Visitor'' (1946), ''Clutterbuck'' (1947), and ''I Have Been Here Before'' (1948).

At the Independent she was in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (1951).  She appeared in numerous radio serials in the 1950s including ''[[Blue Hills (radio serial)|Blue Hills]]'', ''[[Portia Faces Life#Australian offshoot|Portia Faces Life]]'' and ''Gabrielle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48947426 |title=Muriel Steinbeck to Star in "Smithy". |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=9 February 1945 |accessdate=18 April 2014 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article127294808 |title=Film Lead for Girl From Barrier. |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]] |location=Adelaide |date=10 February 1945 |accessdate=18 April 2014 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinbeck had roles in a horse racing melodrama, ''[[Into the Straight]]'' (1949), and another biopic, ''[[Wherever She Goes]]'' (1951), playing the mother of [[Eileen Joyce]].

She was in the film ''[[Long John Silver (film)|Long John Silver]]'' (1954) and the ensuring series ''[[The Adventures of Long John Silver]]'' (1954), playing the wife of the governor.

===Television===
Steinbeck starred in Australia's first TV serial, ''[[Autumn Affair]]'' (1958).

She was in two one-off TV dramas, ''[[Reflections in Dark Glasses]]'' (1960) and ''[[Thunder on Sycamore Street]]'' (1961) and had a recurring role in a serial, ''[[Stormy Petrel]]'' (1960).

In 1961 she was in ''Merchant of Venice'' at the Elizabethan Theatre Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131332626 |title=Ambitious production opens tonight in city |newspaper=[[The Cumberland Argus]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=9 August 1961 |accessdate=30 April 2018 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1963 she was a regular member of the ABC's program 'English for New Australians' and she compared ''Woman's World''.

She was in ''[[Heartbreak House]]'' (1964) at the Old Tote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230665243 |title=AT SYDNEY THEATRES |newspaper=[[Le Courrier Australien]] |volume=, |issue=36 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=4 September 1964 |accessdate=30 April 2018 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her final film role was in ''[[They're a Weird Mob]]'' (1966) playing the wife of [[Chips Rafferty]].

===Personal life===
She was married to her first husband, a journalist, from 7 July 1934 until their divorce in 1949. They had a daughter, born in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18133383 |title=Muriel Steinbeck Divorced |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=10 September 1949 |accessdate=18 April 2014 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She then married company manager and engineer Brian Dudley Nicholson in 1951.

===Retirement===
Retiring from acting in 1966, she accompanied her husband to [[Orange, New South Wales]], and became a teacher of the arts, including running a drama school and authoring a book titled ''On Stage: A Practical Guide To the Actor's Craft''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51384511 |title=Contentment is a Quarry |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] |volume=36 |issue=37  |date=12 February 1969 |accessdate=30 April 2018 |page=17 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died of cancer on 20 July 1982, a day before her 69th birthday.

==History of Establishment==

The initial formal endeavor of establishing an Open University in Nepal can be traced to 1999, the year when the Government became a signatory of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Consortium to Open and Distance Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher   = International Journal of Information and Education Technology
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Fiscal Year 2008/09, the then Finance Minister Dr. Baburam Bhattarai in his annual budget speech allocated funding to implement Open University concept in order to provide an opportunity to youths who were deprived of getting education during the conflict period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Nepali government took no concrete action due to the lack of a proper institutional body to initiate implementation of the plan.

Meanwhile, a Canada based non-profit organization, Canada Forum for Nepal (CFFN) brewing the idea of delivering education to the people living in the economically deprived regions of Nepal since 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought together three North American Nepali Diaspora leaders Dr. Ambika P. Adhikari, Dr. Drona P. Rasali and Dr. Pramod Dhakal and an Australian Nepali Diaspora leader Dr. Raju Adhikari to initiate the issue of establishing Open University in Nepal as one of the prime agenda for the Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA)’s International Coordination Council (ICC), which endorsed the Open University of Nepal (OUN) Initiative as its flagship project in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The NRNA commissioned a Task Force to undertake the tasks of OUN Initiative under the leadership of Dr. Pramod Dhakal.  The Task Force worked closely with the Nepalese Ambassadors in Canada and the United States of America as the Government of Nepal’s representatives for coordination in the initial work. Later, the NRNA signed an agreement with the Nepal’s Ministry of Education that provided official mandate of working on the OUN agenda to NRNA. Nepali Diaspora academics around the world rallied behind the OUN initiative, which turned into an important Diaspora project. Later, a series of Memoranda of Understandings were signed between the Government of Nepal and NRNA (2013, 2014 and 2015) and many workshops, webinars and symposia were held in different parts of the world including Canada, US, Australia, South Korea, Malaysia, and Nepal between 2010 and 2016. The places of these meetings, workshops and symposia included Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton, Houston, Sydney, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and Kathmandu. Athabasca University (AU), Canada’s Open University, located near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, provided technical support, and academic impetus throughout the process of formulating the plan and in the implementation of the program for the OUN. AU’s leaders, including its president, vice president and director for distance education travelled to Kathmandu on two occasions and attended several other OUN meetings including in Ottawa, Houston, Sydney and Vancouver. The OUN’s original proponents visited the AU, and held several meetings with the AU leaders to understand the working of an open university.  Other universities, such as California State University Long Beach in the initiative of Dean Jeet Joshee, and University of Houston also provided technical and moral support in various stage of the development of OUN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2011, Dr. Pramod Dhakal moved from Canada to Nepal to work solely on volunteering basis to lead the OUN Initiative. In 2011 and 2012, the OUN Initiative team lobbied with the then Prime Minister Dr. Baburam Bhattarai and several other Nepali leaders and policy makers to establish an interim institutional structure known as Open University Nepal Infrastructure Development Board (OUNIDB) to undertake OUN development activities until the OUN bill was passed by the Nepal’s Parliament. Dr. Pramod Dhakal was inducted as NRNA representative to the OUNIDB. He along with and several NRNA leaders and academics met numerous times with the Nepali parliamentarians, ministers, political and academic leaders, and senior level officials to discuss and promote the OUN. This group also intensely lobbied for the passage of the OUN Bill in the Nepali parliament. Dr. Pramod Dhakal worked full time to move the OUN agenda forward and wrote numerous reports, policy documents, and contributed in the development of drafts of the OUN bill, agreements between NRNA and the Government of Nepal and Athabasca University, and several other background documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''OpenCards''' is a [[Free and open source software|free]] [[spaced repetition]] [[flashcard]] program. The software is similar to [[SuperMemo]], [[Anki (software)|Anki]] or [[Mnemosyne (software)|Mnemosyne]].

The flashcards are saved as [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] presentation files and may include text, images, sounds and [[LaTeX]] equations. The learning states are saved in hidden meta-data files in the same directory as the flashcards files. OpenCards implements learning schemes for [[Cramming (education)|short-term]] and [[Long-term memory|long-term]] memorization.

==Flashcard Format==
[[File:OpenCards - Category View.png|thumb|The category view of OpenCards that allows organizing flashcards sets]]
[[File:OpenCards - Learning View.png|thumb|The learning view of OpenCards]]

OpenCards uses PowerPoint ppt-files as flashcard sets. Thereby, slide-titles are considered as questions and the slide contents as their answers. OpenCards also supports a reversed mode in which slide contents are treated as questions and the slide title as their answers, which allows creating image, formula or sound questions.

By allowing users to create flashcard files in ppt-format with [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] or [[LibreOffice]], it overcomes the major limitation of other flashcard software, which usually rely on custom formats and flashcard editors. Internally, OpenCards relies on [[Apache POI]] to render slides from ppt-files.

==Learning Modes==

OpenCards implements two different learning models. A [[Leitner system|box-based]] short-term learning procedure, called last-minute learning, and a more sophisticated long-term memorization model based on the principles of [[active recall]] and the [[Forgetting curve|forgetting model]]. The latter is implemented as an improved version of the SuperMemo2 algorithm. The SM2 algorithm had been created for SuperMemo in the late 1980s, but still forms the basis of many spaced repetition software applications. OpenCards's implementation of the [[algorithm]] has been modified to allow priorities on cards, and to show cards in order of their urgency.

==History==

OpenCards started as flashcard learning extension for [[OpenOffice.org#Impress|OpenOffice Impress]] in spring 2008, from which it inherited the first part of its name.  In 2008 it won a Bronze award in the OpenOffice.org Community Innovation Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://development.openoffice.org/awardees-2008.html Community Innovation Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, OpenCards was redesigned to work as stand alone software and to support PowerPoint PPT files as the main flashcard set file format.

==Syncing==

OpenCards implements no synchronization mechanism, but flashcard sets including their learning states can be synced using services like [[Dropbox (service)|DropBox]]. This allows the user to keep their flashcard sets synchronized across multiple computers.

They are represented in teaching techniques that draw upon open technologies and high-quality [[Open Educational Resources|open educational resources]] (OER) in order to facilitate collaborative and flexible learning.&lt;ref name="JISCOEPbrief" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benzato" /&gt; They may involve students participating in online, [[peer production]] communities &lt;ref name="COLTdef" /&gt; within activities intended to support learning &lt;ref name="OPALdef" /&gt; or more broadly, any context where access to educational opportunity through freely available online content and services is the norm.&lt;ref name="JISCOEPbrief" /&gt; Such activities may include (but are not limited to &lt;ref name="JISCOEPbrief" /&gt;), the creation, use and repurposing of [[Open Educational Resources|open educational resources]] and their adaptation to the contextual setting.&lt;ref name=OPALdef /&gt;&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ICDEdef" /&gt; OEP can also include the open sharing of teaching practices&lt;ref name="JISCOEPbrief" /&gt; and aim "to raise the quality of education and training and innovate educational practices on an institutional, professional and individual level".&lt;ref name="OPALmission" /&gt; The OEP community includes policy makers, managers/ administrators of organisations, educational professionals and learners.&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt; OEP are also viewed as the next phase in OER development that continues to transform 21st century learning and learners.&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt;

==The Scope of Open Educational Practices==
A database or repository of [[open educational resources]] is not open educational practice (Ehlers 2011). OER have a lifecycle of creation, use, and management. Open educational practices aim to take the focus beyond building further access to OER and consider how in practice, such resources support education and promote quality and innovation in teaching and learning. They focus on reproduction/understanding, connecting information, application, competence and responsibility rather than the availability of good resources.&lt;ref name="ElConUnleash" /&gt;

===Definitions===
There is no canonical definition of open educational practice, however various groups and scholars have given their definition or view. One such scholar is Ehlers (2011) who defines OEP "as practices which support the (re)use and production of OER through institutional policies, promote innovative pedagogical models, and respect and empower learners as co-producers on their lifelong learning path".&lt;ref name="EhOEROEP" /&gt; A definition used by others either in its entirety&lt;ref name="ICDEdef" /&gt; or as basis for further development.&lt;ref name="JISCOEPbrief" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ICDEdef" /&gt;
* The ''[[Open Educational Quality (OPAL) Initiative]]'' define Open Educational Practices as "the use of [[Open Educational Resources]] to raise the quality of education and training and innovate educational practices on institutional, professional and individual level".&lt;ref name="OPALmission" /&gt;
* The [[International Council for Open and Distance Education]] (ICDE): "Open Educational Practices are defined as practices which support the production, use and reuse of high quality open educational resources (OER) through institutional policies, which promote innovative pedagogical models, and respect and empower learners as co-producers on their lifelong learning path".&lt;ref name="ICDEdef" /&gt;
* The UK OER support and evaluation team suggest that (compared to ICDE) "a broader definition would encompass all activities that open up access to educational opportunity, in a context where freely available online content and services (whether 'open', 'educational' or not) are taken as the norm".&lt;ref name="JISCOEPbrief" /&gt;
* The [[Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education]] (ISKME) defines Open Educational Practices (OEP) as comprising a set of skills in collaboration, curation, curricular design, and leadership around the use of [[Open Educational Resources]]. OEP build educator capacity for using OER to improve curriculum, instruction, and pedagogy, and to gain skills in digital resource curation and curriculum creation, and to actively collaborate around and advocate for innovative approaches to open education and OER. ISKME developed the Open Educational Practice Rubric to articulate key learning objectives for integrating OER and open educational practice into teaching and learning improvement and leadership.&lt;ref name="ISKMEOEPRubric" /&gt;
* The Center for Open Learning and Teaching (University of Mississippi) state that "Open Educational Practices (OEP) are teaching techniques that introduce students to online peer production communities. Such communities (for instance, Wikipedia, YouTube, Open Street Map) host dynamic communities and offer rich learning environments".&lt;ref name="COLTdef" /&gt;
* The [[European Foundation for Quality in e-Learning]] (EFQUEL) write that Open Educational Practices are "the next phase in OER development which will see a shift from a focus on resources to a focus on open educational practices being a combination of open resources use and open learning architectures to transform learning into 21st century learning environments in which universities’, adult learners and citizens are provided with opportunities to shape their lifelong learning pathways in an autonomous and self-guided way".&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt;
* The [[Cape Town Open Education Declaration]] (with over 2,500 signatories) reads: "open education is not limited to just open educational resources. It also draws upon open technologies that facilitate collaborative, flexible learning and the open sharing of teaching practices that empower educators to benefit from the best ideas of their colleagues. It may also grow to include new approaches to assessment, accreditation and collaborative learning".&lt;ref name="CapeDec" /&gt;

===OEP Areas===
Best practice case studies identify a number of OEP areas.&lt;ref name="OPALclearhouse" /&gt;

{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
{{Plainlist|

==Impact==
Adopting OEP can lead to opportunities for collaborative learning through the affordances of Web 2.0 tools. In this context, open also refers to the learning environment where learner's set their own objectives rather than being restricted by those set externally (a closed environment).&lt;ref name="ElConUnleash" /&gt;

Open educational practices can also provide the experience and tools to help bridge the gap between formal and informal learning, and potentially an open source curriculum or emergent curriculum.&lt;ref name="ElConUnleash" /&gt;

===Levels of Openness===
The trajectory to Open Education Practices lies between the use of open pedagogical models and, resource use and creation.:&lt;ref name="EhOEROEP" /&gt;
* Low - teachers believe they know what learners have to learn. A focus on knowledge transfer
* Medium - Predetermined Objectives (closed environment&lt;ref name="ElConUnleash" /&gt;) but, using open pedagogical models and encourage dialogue and [[Problem-based learning]].
* High - Learning Objectives and pathways highly governed by learners.

The ''[[Open Educational Quality (OPAL) Initiative]]'' define '''Open Educational Practices''' (OEP) as "the use of [[Open Educational Resources]] (OER) to raise the quality of education and training and innovate educational practices on institutional, professional and individual level".&lt;ref name="OPALmission" /&gt;

For the mainstreaming of Open Educational Practices OPAL recommends:&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt;
* Enabling Legislation to Facilitate OEP
** Incentivising OEP through Legislation
** Reducing Legislative Burdens through Harmonisation
** Rethinking Intellectual Property Law for the 21st Century
* Empowering Learners to take up OEP
** Addressing Fragmentation in Learning Resources
** Promoting the provision of Open Educational Assessment
* Strengthening the Evidence-Base of OEP
** Helping institutions nurture OEP
** Addressing Sustainability Concerns
** Making the Societal Benefit Explicit
* Culturing Innovation through Networks
** Supporting Truly Open Collaboration
** Building a Coalition of Stakeholders around Principles of Openness
* Improving Trust in OEP
** Integrate OEP into Institutional Quality Procedures
** Create Open Academic/Scientific Trust Infrastructures

The [[International Council for Open and Distance Education]] sees OEP as those practices which support the production, use and reuse of high quality [[open educational resources]] and regards that OEP are often achieved through institutional policies, which promote innovative pedagogical models, and respect. Learners are empowered as co-producers on their [[lifelong learning]] path. The scope of OEP covers all areas of OER governance: policy makers, managers and administrators of organizations, educational professionals and learners.&lt;ref name="ICDEdef" /&gt;

Open e-Learning Content Observatory Services (OLCOS) project is a Transversal Action under the European eLearning Programme.&lt;ref name="Geser" /&gt;

The OLCOS Roadmap focuses on Open Educational Practices, providing orientation and recommendations to educational decision makers on how to develop the use of OER. To further benefit from OERs one needs to better understand how their role could promote innovation and change in educational practices.&lt;ref name="Geser" /&gt;

The Roadmap states that; delivering OER to the dominant model of teacher-centred knowledge transfer will have little effect in equipping teachers, students and workers with the knowledge and skills required in the knowledge economy and, lifelong learning. Downloading Web-accessible, open teaching materials for classes and, continuing a one-way channel of content provision, will likely mirror the little impact achieved with regard to changing educational practices following the massive investments in the e-learning infrastructure by educational institutions. Open Educational Practices aim to deliver a competency-focused, constructivist paradigm of learning and promote a creative and collaborative engagement with digital content, tools and services to meet knowledge and skills required today.&lt;ref name="Geser" /&gt;

===SCORE===
The Support Centre for Open Resources in Education (SCORE) at the Open University (UK), was the second major initiative to be funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce). (The first being the UKOER programme, jointly run by the [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] (JISC) and the [[Higher Education Academy]] (HEA)).&lt;ref name="LaneSCORE" /&gt;

Discussions and actions were moving on from how open educational resources are published to how they are used. Placing OER as an enabler, within a wider set of open educational practices. Over a period of three years, SCORE, initiated a series of activities and events that involved several hundred educational practitioners from the majority of the higher education institutions in England.&lt;ref name="LaneSCORE" /&gt;

There has been interest in how educational practitioners would accept and embed open resources into their practices (Geser, 2007 in &lt;ref name="LaneSCORE" /&gt;). Sharing is at the heart of the philosophy OER and probably OEP and thus collective and cooperative activities between people and institutions are likely to be a key factor in the sustainability of such practices. SCORE reports it succeeded in raising the profile of OER and OEP within UK higher education institutions by assisting existing [[communities of practice]] and by creating new communities of practice to form a much larger network of practice that will be sustained by its participants.&lt;ref name="LaneSCORE" /&gt;

==Challenges==
There are many challenges to the adoption of open educational practices. Certain aspects like technology have received greater attention than others&lt;ref name="Benzato" /&gt; but all of the factors below inhibit widespread use of open educational practices:
* Technology - Lack of or insufficient investment in broadband access as well as up-to-date software&lt;ref name="Benzato" /&gt; and hardware
* Business Model - OER and OEP can incur a significant provider cost.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt; Typically financial models focus on technology, but they also need to account for staff; i.e., those who create, reuse, mix, and modify the content.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
* Law &amp; Policy - There is either ignorance on open access licenses, such as Creative Commons License and Gnu Public License,&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt; and/or restrictive intellectual property rights that limit the development of OEP.&lt;ref name="Benzato" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaffert" /&gt;
* Pedagogy - Traditional models of learning are teacher-centric&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt; where teachers dispense knowledge to students,&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt; and teachers/professors may not know how to integrate OEP into courses.&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt;
* Quality Assessment - There is not a quick and universal way to assess the quality of OER. [[MERLOT]], based on the academic peer review process, has only reviewed 14% of submitted material.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
* Cultural Imperialism - There is the concern that Western institutions use OEP to design educational courses for developing countries.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;

===Strategies &amp; Recommendations===
In order for there to be widespread adoption of OEP, legal and educational policy must change&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt; and OEP needs to become sustainable.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
* Funding - Develop a sustainable funding model for OEP that addresses technology and staffing. Various funding models being explored and examples:
:* Endowment Model, e.g. the [[Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Project]].&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Membership Model, e.g. [[Sakai Project|Sakai Educational Partners Program]] where member organizations pay a fee.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Donations Model, e.g. Wikipedia and [[Apache Foundation]]. Even though Apache has modified it so that there are fees for some services.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Conversion Model, e.g. Redhat, Ubuntu, SuSe. They convert free subscribers to paying customers for advanced features and support.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Contributor Pay Model, e.g. [[Public Library of Science]] (PLoS) where contributors pay for the cost of maintaining the contribution.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Sponsorship Model, e.g. MIT iCampus Outreach Initiative, which is sponsored by Microsoft &amp; China Open Resources for Education, and Stanford on iTunes, which is sponsored by Stanford &amp; Apple. They are free for users with commercial messages by sponsors.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Institutional Model, e.g. [[MIT OpenCourseWare|MIT OpenCourseWare Project]].&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Government Model including UN programmes, e.g. [[SchoolNet|Canada's SchoolNet Project]].&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Partnership and Exchange, e.g. Universities working together to create OER systems.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
* Law &amp; Policy - In terms of law, there should be an open access mandate for partially or fully publicly funded research.&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaffert" /&gt; Also teachers and researchers should be better informed about their intellectual property rights. Researchers and teachers who use public funding should sign non-exclusive copyrights so their institutions make their work available under appropriate licenses.&lt;ref name="Schaffert" /&gt;
* Open advocates should demand public-private partnerships
* Build stakeholders -
* Quality Assessment -
* Pedagogy - Help teachers change to facilitate use of OEP to emphasize learners' developing competences, knowledge, and skills. Therefore, teaching is no longer educator-centric, but instead it focuses on what learners can do for themselves.&lt;ref name="Schaffert" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6144">'''PBS Digital Studios''' is a [[YouTube]] channel and network through which [[PBS]] distributes original educational web video content. It comprises both original series and partnerships with existing YouTube channels. Most of the series are about [[science]], [[popular culture|pop culture]], [[art]], [[food]], [[news]], and [[music]], though the channel originally launched with a series of video remixes based on PBS icons such as [[Mr. Rogers]].

== History ==
PBS Digital Studios was founded by [[Jason Seiken]] in June 2012.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2013/07/18/looking-back-on-a-year-of-pbs-digital-studios/ Looking Back On A Year Of PBS Digital Studios], July 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They had their first viral hit with a "remix" of [[autotune]]d vocals from ''[[Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood]]'' titled "Garden of Your Mind."&lt;ref name="Current.org"&gt;[http://www.current.org/2014/07/first-scripted-series-from-pbs-digital-studios-updates-frankenstein-for-modern-age/ First scripted series from PBS Digital Studios updates Frankenstein for modern age], July 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PBS Digital Studios network has received more than 500 million views and has over 7 million subscribers. Popular series found on their channels include Crash Course, Blank on Blank, It’s Okay To Be Smart, and the multiple [[Webby Award]]-winning PBS Idea Channel.&lt;ref name="bythe#s"&gt;[http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/07/23/pbs-digital-studios-to-premiere-first-scripted-series-frankenstein-m-d-on-tuesday-august-19/286085/ PBS Digital Studios to Premiere First Scripted Series 'Frankenstein, M.D.' on Tuesday, August 19] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826160705/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/07/23/pbs-digital-studios-to-premiere-first-scripted-series-frankenstein-m-d-on-tuesday-august-19/286085/ |date=2014-08-26 }}, July 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Each month, the shows average more than 5 million streams.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;[https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/pbs-launching-4-new-digital-original-series-1201171901/ PBS Launching 4 New Digital Original Series], May 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first scripted series, ''[[Frankenstein, MD]]'', launched on August 19, 2014 and ran until October 31, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/frankenstein-md-anna-lore/|title=Newcomer Anna Lore cast as title role in new Pemberley Digital series 'Frankenstein, M.D.'|date=2014-07-23|work=The Daily Dot|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Frankenstein, MD (TV Series 2014– )|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3991298/episodes?year=2014|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, PBS Digital Studios partnered with the [[Green brothers]]' series [[Crash Course (YouTube)|Crash Course]], commissioning three courses in astronomy, U.S. government, and philosophy.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thevideoink.com/news/vlogbrothers-bring-crash-course-pbs-digital-studios-classrooms-nationwide/#.VIngM2TF_Xc&lt;/ref&gt; Crash Course Astronomy launched January 15, 2015, Crash Course U.S. Government &amp; Politics launched January 23, 2015, and Crash Course Philosophy launched February 8, 2016.

'''''Pedagogical Sketchbook''''' is a book by [[Paul Klee]]. It is based on his extensive lectures on visual form at [[Bauhaus]] Staatliche Art School where he was a teacher in between 1921-1931.
Originally handwritten – as a pile of working notes he used in his lectures – it was eventually edited by [[Walter Gropius]], designed by [[László Moholy-Nagy]] and published in 1925 as a Bauhaus student manual (Bauhausbucher No.2, as the second in the series of the fourteen Bauhaus books) under the original title: ''Pädagogisches Skizzenbuch''.
It was translated into English by [[Sibyl Moholy-Nagy]] (in 1953), who also wrote an introduction for it.

Along with other Bauhaus books such as ''Theory of Color'' (by [[Johannes Itten]]) and ''Point and Line to Plane'' (by [[Wassily Kandinsky]]), ''Pedagogical Sketchbook'' is a legacy of teaching methods on art theory and practice at Bauhaus Staatliche Art School.

The book is still in print.

== Background ==
During his teaching career at Bauhaus, Klee reflected on his own working methods and techniques.
“When I came to be teacher”, he wrote, “I had to account explicitly for what I had been used to doing unconsciously.” &lt;ref&gt;Giedion-Welcker: page 158.&lt;/ref&gt;
He left over 3000 handwritten pages developed as a theoretical basis for his lectures, some of which are still unpublished.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zpk.org/ww/en/pub/web_root/act/wissenschaftliches_archiv/originaldokumente.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

From the same period comes another one of his books: ''The thinking Eye'', dealing with the same issues as ''Pedagogical Sketchbook'', but much more extensive in scope. However, this book was published and translated later, after his death (1956; trans. 1961).

== Teaching concept ==
''Pedagogical Sketchbook'' is an [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] art investigation of dynamic principles in visual arts. Klee takes his students on an ‘adventure in seeing’&lt;ref&gt;Moholy-Nagy: concluding note.&lt;/ref&gt; guiding them step-by-step through a challenging conceptual framework. Objects are rendered in a complex relation to physical and intellectual space concepts. It is an exercise in modern art thinking.

In her introduction, Sibyl Moholy-Nagy divides the book into 4 different parts corresponding to the 4 conceptual frameworks. Each framework is illustrated by intricate drawings (mixture of what looks like creative arithmetic or geometry sketches, scribbles and mental notes).

Starting chapter concerns ‘[[Screenplay|Line]] and [[Structure]]’. A dot goes for a walk… freely and without a goal.&lt;ref&gt;Moholy-Nagy: page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dot is a “point of progression” and by shifting its position forward becomes a line. Line variations lead to even more complex structures. It can move freely in a calligraphic stroke, or circumscribe, act as a planar definition, as a mathematical structural element (as in [[Golden Section]]) or as a path in motion (when it coordinates kinetic movements such as in muscle contraction). Artist's world is dynamic – in the state of becoming – rather than static.

In ‘[[Dimension]] and [[Equilibrioception|Balance]]’, the line is related to psychological and social concepts of space. Klee explains subjectivity of our perception by comparing examples of optical illusion with [[horizon]] and [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]]. We use them as orientation points within the space. As an illustration, Klee uses a stylized drawing representing a tightrope walker with a bamboo stick as a ‘horizon’ point, keeping his balance. These examples evoke our reality as constructed and arbitrary. “Dimension is in itself nothing but an arbitrary expansion of form into height, width, depth and time”.&lt;ref&gt;Moholy-Nagy: page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; By challenging conventional perception of his students, Klee shows them a way ‘beyond’ physical realm, into the world of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[spirtuality|spiritual]]. It is an invitation to approach art intuitively, since outer perception can be deceptive (socially constructed).

The third part is about “Gravitational Curve”. A very first drawing of a strong black arrow pointing downwards postulates man as a tragic figure always brought down by a plummet (a black arrow) of a gravitational force. However, Klee also points that water and atmosphere are transitional regions, where spirit gets lighter and breaks free. This is a spiritual space open to dynamic positions, new symbols and imaginative co-relations of visual elements (mechanical law of nature versus imaginative vision rendering of an object in art).

Continuing further into the final part of the manual ‘Kinetic and Chromatic Energy’, Klee gives examples of ‘creative kinetics’ defying gravitational force such as centripetal force in pendulum and spinning top, or a ‘feathered arrow’.&lt;ref&gt;Moholy-Nagy: page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; He continues with a ‘symbolic’ arrow illustrating similar efforts of a man to move ‘a bit further than customary – further than possible’.&lt;ref&gt;Moholy-Nagy: page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Last drawings in the book are related to chromatic and thermo-dynamic field where a color is put in relation to motion: “Motion that may be called infinitive…exists only in the activation of color moving between the fervid contrasts of utter black and utter white”.&lt;ref&gt;Moholy-Nagy: page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Pietro (called Piero) Portaluppi was born in Milan, son of the engineer Luisa Gadda e Oreste.

He graduated in 1905 from the Istituto tecnico Carlo Cattaneo and registered at the [[Politecnico di Milano|Politecnico]], studying with [[Enrico Agostino Griffini]] and Carlo Calzecchi. During this time, he worked as a [[caricaturist]] with the satirical newspapers ''Il Babau'', ''A quel paese'', and ''[[Il Guerin Meschino]]''.

In September 1910, he graduated as an architect and won the Gold Medal of the College of Engineers and Architects of Milan, as its laureate. For the electrical company Conti, he worked on hydroelectric plants, mostly located in Formazza. The most famous are in Verampio (1912–1917), Valdo (1920–1923), Crevoladossola (1923–1924), and Cadarese (1925–1929). For the Azienda Electrica Municipale di Milano, he designed the plant of Grosio (1918–1920).

During the First World War, Portaluppi worked for the military in the Veneto and Friuli Regions. He resumed his professional activity after the war, rebuilding la [[Pinacoteca di Brera]], the villa Fossati, and the [[Casa degli Atellani]] in Corso Magenta, the home of [[Ettore Conti]]. Conti introduced Portaluppi to Milan's high society and started to have the city's most important families as clients such as Borletti, Fossati, Venti and Crespi, [[Angelo Campiglio]], and [[Mino Brughera]]. In 1920, Portaluppi designed two projects that are viewed as emblematic of his architecture: the skyscraper S.K.N.E. for the area of [[Allabanuel]], and an utopian city, [[Hellytown]].

Other projects during this period were the [[Palazzo della Banca Commerciale Italiana]] (1928–1932), the [[Planetarium Hoepli]] (1929–1930), residential buildings for the Buonarroti-Carpaccio-Giotto family (1926–1930), the house Crespi on [[corso Venezia]] (1927–1930), and the palazzo Crespi on [[piazza Crispi]] (1928–1932). He designed the Italian Pavilion for the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|Universal Exposition in Barcelona in 1929]].

Between 1934 and 1938, he work on the historic restoration of the Church of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie]] and he continued that work after the war. Among his most important works are the [[Palazzo INA]], piazza Diaz (1932–1937), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Villa Necchi Campiglio|it}} (1932–1935),&lt;ref&gt;[http://catesthill.com/2014/01/28/villa-necchi-campiglio-milan-by-piero-portaluppi/ Villa Necchi Campiglio, Milan by Piero Portaluppi |]. Catesthill.com (28 January 2014). Retrieved on 3 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[palazzo Ras]] on via Torino (1935–1938).

Following the Second World War, he devoted himself increasingly to teaching and professional organizations. He continued to design and collaborated on later architectural projects with [[Gio Ponti]] (1956–1962).

In July 1913, Portaluppi married Lia Baglia. They had three children: Luisa, Oreste and Tuccio. His son Tuccio died in the Second World War. On 6 July 1967, Piero Portaluppi dies in his house on corso Magenta in Milan.
In the 1950s he collaborated with several projects together with [[Gualtiero Galmanini]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portaluppi.org/opere/ampliamento-della-sede-del- Banco-ambrosiano/], Piero Portaluppi Foundation with the contribution of Mediobanca&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Villa Necchi Campiglio was a principal shooting location for [[Luca Guadagnino]]'s film ''[[I Am Love (film)|I Am Love]]'' (2009).

The '''Pyongyang Theological Seminary''' (also known the '''Pyongyang Theological Academy''',&lt;ref name="stat_Kore"/&gt; but commonly known simply as the '''Pyongyang Seminary'''&lt;ref name="KurianLamport2015"/&gt;) is a Protestant [[theological seminary]] in [[Pyongyang]], the capital of [[North Korea]]. It is run by the government-controlled [[Korean Christian Federation]] (KCF) and trains [[pastor]]s and [[evangelism|evangelist]]s for it.

Founded in 1901 as the '''Pyongyang Chosun Jesus Presbyterian Seminary''', the seminary has historically been associated with [[Presbyterianism]]. It became the center of Korean Christianity of the early 20th century. By 1916 its founder [[Samuel Austin Moffett]] was in disagreement over practical matters with another teacher, [[James Scarth Gale]]. The row developed into a schism on doctrinal matters and in 1959 the seminary split into the conservative [[Chongshin University]] and the liberal [[Presbyterian College and Theological Seminary]].

In 1938, during the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]], the seminary had been temporarily closed down after students defied orders to bow to [[Shinto shrines]]. After the [[division of Korea]], the seminary was relocated to [[Seoul]] in [[South Korea]] and renamed the '''Presbyterian Theological Seminary'''.

The Pyongyang-based seminary resumed operations in 1972 after having been assumed by the KCF. When its funds ran out in 1995, the [[Korean Methodist Church]] (KMC) of South Korea assumed a share of its financial responsibilities.

Originally called the Pyongyang Chosun Jesus Presbyterian Seminary,&lt;ref name="KurianLamport2015"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Kurian||editor-first1=George Thomas|editor-last2=Lamport||editor-first2=Mark A.|last=McCord|first=Stephen K.|title=Encyclopedia of Christian Education|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6YoCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA237|year=2015|location=Lanham|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0-8108-8493-9|pages=237–238|chapter=Chongshin University}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was founded in 1901 by [[Samuel Austin Moffett]],&lt;ref name="BenedettoMcKim2009b"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benedetto|first1=Robert|last2=McKim|first2=Donald K.|title=Historical Dictionary of the Reformed Churches|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edhZ_g-RvyMC&amp;pg=PA104|edition=2nd|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham|isbn=978-0-8108-7023-9|pages=104-105|chapter=Chongshin University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the father of [[Samuel H. Moffett]].&lt;ref name="BenedettoMcKim2009f"/&gt; Samuel Austin was motivated to found the seminary in [[Pyongyang]] because the city had been badly damaged in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].&lt;ref name="Corfield2014a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corfield|first=Justin|title=Historical Dictionary of Pyongyang|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5zKWBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA140|year=2014|publisher=Anthem Press|location=London|isbn=978-1-78308-341-1|page=140|chapter=Moffett, Samuel Austin (1864-1939)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the seminary would consist of two years of preparatory courses and the actual seminary lasting three years.&lt;ref name="KurianLamport2015"/&gt; In the beginning, Samuel Austin taught his students at home.&lt;ref name="BenedettoMcKim2009f"/&gt; He was its first president until 1918 and a faculty member until 1935.&lt;ref name="KurianLamport2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BenedettoMcKim2009f"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benedetto|first1=Robert|last2=McKim|first2=Donald K.|title=Historical Dictionary of the Reformed Churches|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edhZ_g-RvyMC&amp;pg=PA311|edition=2nd|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham|isbn=978-0-8108-7023-9|page=311|chapter=Moffett, Samuel Austin (1864-1939)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Seminary was the center of Korean Christianity of the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Hallmark2007"/&gt;

In 1905 the seminary became affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States]].&lt;ref name="BenedettoMcKim2009b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KimKollontai2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Sebastian C.

Their differences concerning the quality of teaching, materials, and admission would develop into a schism between conservatives and liberals.{{sfn|Cho|2010|p=147}} Initially, the seminary remained conservative and mission-oriented.&lt;ref name="Sunoo1976"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sunoo|first=Harold Hakwon|title=Repressive State and Resisting Church: The Politics of CIA in South Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BQpFAAAAIAAJ|year=1976|publisher=Korean American Cultural Association, CMC|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seminary was temporarily closed in 1938 following the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]]. The Japanese occupiers demanded that students of the seminary would bow to [[Shinto shrines]], something that they could not agree to.&lt;ref name="KurianLamport2015"/&gt; Until 1940, the seminary had been the only seminary in Korea maintained by the Presbyterian Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Koreana Quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJYeAQAAMAAJ|year=1961|publisher=International Research Centre.|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[division of Korea]], the seminary was relocated to [[Seoul]] in [[South Korea]] in 1948 and renamed the Presbyterian Theological Seminary.&lt;ref name="KurianLamport2015"/&gt;

In 1959 the seminary finally split due to the doctrinal differences into the conservative [[Chongshin University]] and the more moderate [[Presbyterian College and Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref name="BenedettoMcKim2009b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BenedettoMcKim2009g"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benedetto|first1=Robert|last2=McKim|first2=Donald K.|title=Historical Dictionary of the Reformed Churches|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edhZ_g-RvyMC&amp;pg=PA307|edition=2nd|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham|isbn=978-0-8108-7023-9|page=307|chapter=Presbyterian College and Theological Seminary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under government control===
In 1972, the seminary was reopened and assumed by the government-controlled Protestant body [[Korean Christian Federation]] (KCF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious and Theological Abstracts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TgwZAQAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Religious and Theologial Abstracts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucan_nort"/&gt; The seminary operated under KCF until 1995 when it ran out of funds. In April 1999, the [[Korean Methodist Church]] (KMC) of South Korea offered to fund the seminary to secure the continuation of its operation. KMC bid $600,000 to provide funding for three years.&lt;ref name="ucan_nort"&gt;{{Cite web | title = North Korea's only seminary will be reopened with help from the South | publisher = Union of Catholic Asian News | date = 29 May 2000 | accessdate = 12 August 2017 | url = http://www.ucanews.com/story-archive/?post_name=/2000/05/29/north-koreas-only-seminary-will-be-reopened-with-help-from-the-south&amp;post_id=16134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It reopened in 2000,&lt;ref name="stat_Kore"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Democratic People's Republic of Korea | work = 2012 Report on International Religious Freedom | publisher = U.S. Department of State | date = 20 May 2013 | accessdate = 14 August 2017 | url = https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2012/eap/208238.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a new building was completed in 2003.&lt;ref name="stat_Kore2006"/&gt;

==Operation==
The Seminary is run by the KCF,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Do|last2=Kim|last3=Han|last4=Lee|last5=Hong|first1=Kyung-ok|first2=Soon-am|first3=Dong-ho|first4=Keum-soon|first5=Min|title=White Paper on Human Rights in North Korea 2015|date=2015|publisher=Korea Institute for National Unification|location=Seoul|url=http://lib.kinu.or.kr//wonmun/005/0001472282.pdf#page=223|isbn=978-89-8479-802-1|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; which chooses its students and devises its curriculum. KMC, however, is consulted each semester. The seminary is located in [[Pyongyang]], the capital of [[North Korea]].&lt;ref name="ucan_nort"/&gt;

'''Recognition of prior learning''' ('''RPL'''), '''prior learning assessment''' ('''PLA'''), or '''prior learning assessment and recognition''' ('''PLAR'''), describes a process used by regulatory bodies, [[adult learning]] centres, [[career development]] practitioners, [[military]] organizations, [[human resources]] professionals, [[employer]]s, [[training]] institutions, [[college]]s and [[universities]] around the world to evaluate [[skill]]s and [[knowledge]] acquired outside the [[classroom]] for the purpose of recognizing competence against a given set of standards, competencies, or learning outcomes. RPL is practiced in many countries for a variety of purposes, for example an individual's standing in a profession, trades qualifications, academic achievement, recruitment, performance management, career and succession planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartram|first=Dave|date=November 2005|title=The Great Eight competencies: a criterion-centric approach to validation|journal=The Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=90|issue=6|pages=1185–1203|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.90.6.1185|issn=0021-9010|pmid=16316273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CATANO|first=VICTOR M.|last2=DARR|first2=WENDY|last3=CAMPBELL|first3=CATHERINE A.|date=2007|title=PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL OF BEHAVIOR-BASED COMPETENCIES: A RELIABLE AND VALID PROCEDURE|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1744-6570.2007.00070.x|journal=Personnel Psychology|language=en|volume=60|issue=1|pages=201–230|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.2007.00070.x|issn=0031-5826|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods of assessing prior learning are varied and include: evaluation of prior experience gained through [[volunteer work]], previous paid or unpaid employment, or observation of actual workplace behavior. The essential element of RPL is that it is an assessment of evidence provided by an individual to support their claim for competence against a given set of standards or learning outcomes.

RPL is sometimes confused with Credit Transfer, assessments conducted in order to recognize advanced standing or for assigning academic credit. The essential difference between the two is that RPL considers evidence of competence that may be drawn from any aspect of an applicant's professional or personal life. Credit Transfer and advanced standing deal primarily with an evaluation of academic performance as it relates to a particular field of study and whether or not advanced standing may be granted towards the gaining of additional qualifications. Some academic institutions include Credit Transfer within their overall RPL umbrella, as the process still involves assessment of prior learning, regardless of how achieved.

== Terminology ==
RPL is known by many names in different countries. It is APL (Accreditation of Prior Learning), CCC (Crediting Current Competence), or APEL (Accrediting Prior Experiential Learning) in the [[UK]], RPL in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], and PLAR (Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition) in [[Canada]] (although different jurisdictions within Canada use RPL and RCC (Recognition of Current Competence). [[France]] has a more sophisticated system in which assessment is known as 'Bilan de competences', 'Bilan des competences approfondi', or 'Validation de Acquis des Experiences (VAE)'. Regardless of the title, all are the same and all are RPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qualifyme.edu.au/rpl-skills-trade-recognition/|title=Qualify Me! Leading Recogntion of Prior Learning (RPL) in Australia|date=2018-04-11|work=Qualify Me!|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
RPL has been the mainstay of all assessments conducted under national vocational education and training systems since the late 1980s and continues to evolve as different VET systems evolve. The concept of RPL can be traced back to the earliest guilds when master craftsmen inspected the work of apprentices in order to determine their competence against the high standards demanded of the different professions of the period. This process was continued during the Industrial Revolution when the first formal apprentice programs were established and realistic workplaces created to train young men and women in the skills and knowledge required of their trade. It was first introduced into the UK by Susan Simosko, a consultant with the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, who adapted it as the central element of all competency-based assessments.

Simosko was employed by the British government to provide support to the creation of the National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) and Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQ) systems during the late 1980s and early 1990s. She introduced and managed the Access to Assessment Initiative project which introduced the concept of Accreditation of Prior Learning as an important pathway for employed and unemployed people to gain formal recognition of their skills and knowledge against standards demanded of employers across the United Kingdom.

Other countries adopted the same processes when developing their own competency-based vocational education and training systems, some aligned solely with the need to assess competence in line with the needs of private and public sector organizations, and others as a critical element of the assessment of skills and knowledge in order to grant vocational qualifications. The National Training Board in Australia was one of the first outside of the UK to develop such a system as a framework for the transition towards the implementation of new apprentice programs and workplace training and assessment under the National Training Reform Agenda. RPL was incorporated under the National Framework for the Recognition of Training and has since remained an important element of all competency-based assessments.

==Benefits==
RPL is a very simple and straightforward process of assessing someone's skills or knowledge, regardless of where and how these were learned. Unlike other forms of assessment it doesn't judge someone's evidence of competence solely by the credentials or qualifications they have achieved, although this can form part of their claim. Nor does it consider where a person worked, their age, gender or physical attributes.

What RPL does is allow people to demonstrate that they are capable of undertaking specific tasks or working in certain industries based on evidence of skills and knowledge gained throughout their life.

RPL is similar to criterion-referenced assessment – assessment of skills and knowledge against certain criteria. However, while such criteria is generally less descriptive than that used in competency standards, it is outcomes-based (i.e., the outcome of somebody doing something, such as the outcome of writing is a letter, or the outcome of making something which results in an end product), not process-based such as learning.

In teaching or traditional training, the criteria against which formative and summative assessments are conducted is known as teaching or training objectives. (Sometimes these are also referred to as learning objectives but these are really the outcome the learners seeks to achieve, not the teacher or trainer.) They may be written in different ways but in all cases they include the behaviour to be observed, the conditions under which such behaviour is to be performed, and the standards or criteria which the performance must meet. These are the standards to be achieved as a result of the learning or training activity.

'''Gateway, Inc.''' -
Snyder joined the computer company [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]] (based in [[Irvine, California|Irvine]], [[California]]) in 1991 as the executive vice president. He served as president and chief operating officer from 1996 to 1997.

'''Venture Capital / Investments''' -
In 1997, Snyder returned to Ann Arbor to found Avalon Investments Inc., a [[venture capital]] company with a $100 million fund, along with the co-founder of Gateway, [[Ted Waitt]]. Snyder was president and chief executive officer of Avalon from 1997 to 2000. He then co-founded Ardesta [[Limited liability company|LLC]], an investment firm, in 2000 along with three co-founders, which invested in 20 start-up companies through 2011. He was chairman and chief executive officer of the company.

'''HealthMedia, Inc.''' -
In 1998, Snyder angel funded and co-founded, with University of Michigan (U-M) School of Public Health professor Victor J. Strecher [https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/strecher-victor.html], HealthMedia Incorporated (HMI), a developer of digital health coaching applications for health promotion, disease prevention, behavioral health, and disease management. The U-M's Office of Technology Transfer [https://techtransfer.umich.edu/] played an integral role in helping HMI get started with Vic Strecher as the founding CEO and the U-M's publicly funded Health Media Research Laboratory (founded and directed by Strecher and now called the Center for Health Communications Research [http://chcr.umich.edu/]) providing the new company with exclusive research and development findings into health-related computerized tailored messaging and the exclusive licence to sell that content [http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20001214/SUB/12140852/um-spawns-spinoffs-patents]. Despite these university-based start-up and R&amp;D advantages, HMI got off to a poor performance start and in 2001 Snyder replaced the founding CEO (Strecher remained on the HMI board) and personally rescued the company from insolvency with more of his own money. After multiple rounds of more additional financing through venture capital (Arboretum Ventures, Ardesta, Avalon Capital Group, AvTech Ventures, Chrysalis Ventures, Princeton Fund) and yet never achieving profitability, HMI was sold in 2008 for a reported $200 million to [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]. The sale of HMI transferred the ownership of all the personal health information accrued from their millions of users to Johnson &amp; Johnson and played a key role in the negotiated price. At the time of the reported $200 million deal, U-M President [[Mary Sue Coleman]] was on Johnson &amp; Johnson's board of directors and the U-M secured millions of dollars with its equity stake in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.mlive.com/businessreview/annarbor/index.ssf/2008/10/johnson_johnson_acquires_ann_a.html|title= Johnson &amp; Johnson acquires Ann Arbor's software firm HealthMedia| first= Sarah|last= Rigg| date= October 30, 2008 |work= M-Live| access-date= October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When campaigning for Michigan governor in 2010, Snyder was quoted as saying, "That company (HMI) is one of the best success stories in the state."[http://temp.techtransfer.umich.edu/news_events/success_stories/story_60.php][http://annarborchronicle.com/2008/10/27/live-at-pjs-its-healthmedia/index.html] Following Snyder's election as Michigan governor, Johnson &amp; Johnson then folded HMI into a subsidiary (Wellness &amp; Prevention, Inc.

'''Non-Profit Service''' -

Snyder was inaugurated as governor on January 1, 2011, at the [[Michigan State Capitol|Capitol]] in [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]]. His first executive order as governor was to divide the Department of Natural Resources and Environment into two distinct departments as they were a few years ago: the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Environmental Quality.&lt;ref name="ExOrder2011-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/snyder/EO-01-2011_342039_7.pdf| title= Executive Reorganization Department of Natural Resources and Environment Creating the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Environmental Quality|format=PDF|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DNRDEQFreePress"&gt;{{cite web|first= Chris |last=Christoff|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20110104/NEWS06/110104055/1320/Snyder-makes-it-official-DNR-and-DEQ-split| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110109120438/http://www.freep.com/article/20110104/NEWS06/110104055/Snyder-makes-it-official-DNR-and-DEQ-split| archivedate= January 9, 2011| place= Lansing| title= Snyder makes it official: DNR and DEQ split| work=Detroit Free Press|date=January 4, 2011| accessdate= October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, 2011, Snyder announced he was appointing Michigan Supreme Court Justice [[Maura D. Corrigan]] to head the Department of Human Services and appointed Michigan Appeals Court Judge [[Brian K. Zahra]] to fill the resulting Supreme Court vacancy. Snyder delivered his first State of the State address on January 19, the earliest Michigan State of the State since Governor [[John Engler]]'s 1996 address on January 17. He endorsed the [[Detroit River International Crossing]] for the first time publicly in the address, which was received favorably by Republicans.&lt;ref name="Job1"&gt;{{cite web|first= Chris |last=Christoff| url= http://www.freep.com/article/20110120/NEWS15/101200510/1285/Gov.-Snyder-Job-1-is-jobs|title=Gov.

Snyder presented his first budget to the legislature on February 17, 2011,&lt;ref name="fy12budgetrelease"&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://michigan.gov/snyder/0,1607,7-277--251733--,00.html|title=Governor Snyder unveils recommended budget to provide foundation for Michigan's reinvention| website= Michigan.gov| publisher= Governor's Office, State of Michigan|date=February 17, 2011| accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling it a plan for "Michigan's reinvention," and saying it would end Michigan's deficits. He described the budget as containing "shared sacrifice" but added that his budget plan would create jobs and spur economic growth. The $46 billion budget reduced $1.8 billion in spending, raised taxes by eliminating tax exemptions on pensions, while at the same time abolished the state's complex business tax, replacing it with a significantly reduced flat tax on the profits of [[C corporation]]s. This shift in tax burden led State Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer to criticize the budget, saying that it did not involve "shared sacrifice," but instead was balanced "on the backs of our kids, working families, and our seniors" and "picks out who he's willing to leave behind."&lt;ref name="SnyderbudgetWhitmer"&gt;{{cite web|first= Nathan| last=  Bomey| url=http://www.annarbor.com/business-review/rick-snyders-budget-proposal-includes-massive-cuts-to-business-taxes-credits-for-film-high-tech-batt|title=Rick Snyder proposes significant elimination of business taxes, elimination of credits for film, high-tech industries |website= AnnArbor.com|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder supported the government backed rescue of the American auto industry.

On March 16, 2011, Snyder signed a controversial bill into law that gave increased powers to [[Financial emergency|emergency managers]] of local municipalities to resolve financial matters.&lt;ref name="legislativebill"&gt;{{cite web|title=State of Michigan Public Act 4 |date= March 16, 2011| url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2011-2012/publicact/htm/2011-PA-0004.htm| website= legislature.mi.gov| publisher= State of Michigan Legislature| access-date= July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was repealed by voter initiative in November 2012.

On December 22, 2011, Snyder signed into law The Public Employee Domestic Partner Benefit Restriction Act, which prevents the same-sex domestic partners of public employees at both the state and local level from receiving health benefits. In January 2012, the [[ACLU]] filed a lawsuit against Snyder and the state of Michigan in federal court on behalf of five Michigan same-sex couples, each with one spouse working for local public schools or municipalities in Michigan. The suit alleges that the law violates the [[equal protection clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annarbor.com/news/gov-rick-snyder-signs-domestic-partner-benefits-ban-into-law|title=Governor Rick Snyder signs domestic partner benefits ban into law|website=AnnArbor.com|first= Kellie| last= Woodhouse| date=December 22, 2011|accessdate=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/bassett_first_amended_complaint.pdf|work=Bassett v.

As governor, Snyder abolished the state's complex business tax in favor of a [[flat tax]], and signed a bill which raised taxes by eliminating tax exemptions for pensions. For years Snyder had said anti-union legislation was not on his agenda, when on the morning of December 6, 2012, during a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] session of the Republican-controlled Michigan legislature, Snyder called a joint press conference with the legislative leadership to announce fast-track [[Right-to-work law|right-to-work legislation]]. The legislation passed both houses of the Michigan legislature that day, without committee votes or public hearings.

On September 10, Detroit reached a deal with three Michigan counties over regional water and sewer services that could eliminate one roadblock to federal court approval of the city's plan to adjust its debt and exit bankruptcy. The deal with Oakland, Wayne and Macomb counties creates a regional water and sewer authority, but allows Detroit to maintain control of its local system. The deal was crucial to adjusting the city's $18 billion of debt and exit the biggest-ever municipal bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Lisa|title=Detroit, counties reach deal over water, sewer authority| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/10/us-usa-detroit-bankruptcy-water-idUSKBN0H41Q420140910 |agency=Reuters| accessdate=December 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, the Governor issued an executive order to establish the [[Michigan Department of Talent and Economic Development]] to house a new state agency, Talent Investment Agency, created from the merger of Michigan State Housing and Development Authority, the Workforce Development Agency, the Governor's Talent Investment Board and the Unemployment Insurance Agency. Over objections from the state legislature, the Department would come into effect 60 days after the start of the next legislative session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lawler|first1=Emily|title=Michigan Gov.

=== Flint water crisis ===
{{main|Flint water crisis}}
From 2011 to 2015, Snyder appointed several individuals as [[Financial emergency in Michigan#Emergency Manager|Emergency Managers]] for [[Flint, Michigan]]. In 2014, emergency manager [[Darnell Earley]] was responsible for changing the source of drinking water for the city to the [[Flint River (Michigan)|Flint River]], which has [[trihalomethanes]] (TTHM) in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fonger|first1=Ron|title=City warns of potential health risks after Flint water tests revealed too much disinfection byproduct|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/01/flint_water_has_high_disinfect.html|publisher=MLive.com|date=January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later discovered that the water was too corrosive, and leached lead out of the service lines that was then ingested by the people of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fonger|first1=Ron|title=AG Schuette: No comment on state's liability for emergency manager decisions| url= http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/10/ag_schuette_has_no_comment_on.html|accessdate=October 9, 2015| work= MLive.com| date=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Erb|first1=Robin|title=Who wants to drink Flint's water?| url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/01/22/water-woes-latest-hit-flint/22193291/| accessdate= October 9, 2015|work=Detroit Free Press|date=January 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, a study by the [[Hurley Medical Center]] found that the community's children were being [[Lead poisoning|poisoned by the lead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Erb| first= Robin| title= Doctor: Lead seen in more Flint kids since water switch|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/09/24/water-lead-in-flint/72747696/|work=Detroit Free Press|date=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Flint transitioned back to its prior source of water in October 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wisely|first1=John|title=Snyder announces $12-million plan to fix Flint water|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/10/08/snyder-flint-water-reconnect/73567778/|work=Detroit Free Press|date=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; lead levels in the city's water remain above the federal action level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Yanan|title=In Flint, Mich., there's so much lead in children's blood that a state of emergency is declared|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/12/15/toxic-water-soaring-lead-levels-in-childrens-blood-create-state-of-emergency-in-flint-mich/|work=The Washington Post|date=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lurie|first1=Julia|title=Flint Kids Have So Much Lead in Their Blood That the Mayor Declared a State of Emergency|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/12/flint-lead-water-state-emergency |work= [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid allegations that the Michigan Health Department was stalling water treatment expert [[Marc Edwards (civil engineering professor)|Marc Edwards]]' effort to obtain public records, journalists have asked when the State of Michigan knew about the lead poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heinlein|first1=Gary|title=When did state know kids in Flint were lead poisoned?| url=http://www.freep.com/story/opinion/columnists/nancy-kaffer/2015/12/17/flint-water-lead/77365380/|work=Detroit Free Press|date=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details were released by the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' and ''[[The Detroit News]]'' on 26 February 2016 that Valerie Brader, Snyder's senior policy adviser and deputy legal counsel, and his chief legal counsel Mike Gadola had expressed concerns to him about Flint's water in October 2014, nearly six months after Flint had begun using the river water to save money, despite Governor Snyder claiming he was unaware of the issue until very recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/flint-water-concerns-michigan-rick-snyder-aides/| title= Flint water concerns raised early on in governor's office |date= February 26, 2016| work= CBSNews.com| agency= Associated Press | access-date= October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A petition from Angelo Scott Brown, a Flint pastor and former Democratic Party gubernatorial candidate, to [[Recall election|recall]] Snyder was denied by the Board of State Canvassers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Heinlein| first1= Gary| title= Petition to recall Snyder over Flint's water denied|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/13/petition-recall-snyder-flints-water-denied/75704122/|work=Detroit Free Press|date=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/us/recall-effort-in-michigan-intensifies-pressure-on-gov-rick-snyder.html| title= Recall Effort in Michigan Intensifies Pressure on Gov.

On November 13, 2015, four families filed a federal [[class action]] lawsuit in the [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]] in Detroit against Snyder and thirteen other city and state officials, including former Flint Mayor [[Dayne Walling]] and ex-emergency financial manager Darnell Earley. The [[Complaint (law)|complaint]] alleges that the officials acted [[Recklessness (law)|recklessly]] and [[negligence|negligently]], leading to serious injuries from [[lead poisoning]], including [[autoimmune disorder]]s, [[skin lesion]]s, and "[[brain fog]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://pittlawpc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mays-vs.-Snyder-et-al.-Complaint-and-Jury-Demand-Final-1.pdf |id= 2:15-cv-14002-JCO-MKM |title= Melisa Mays, et. al. vs. Governor Rick Snyder, et. al.|last1=Pitt |first1=Michael L. |last2=McGehee |first2=Cary S. |last3=Rivers |first3=Beth M. |date=November 13, 2015 |publisher=Pitt Law PC |access-date=November 16, 2015 |quote=Defendants' conduct in exposing Flint residents to toxic water was so egregious and so outrageous that it shocks the conscience.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=4 families sue over lead in Flint water |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/11/15/flint-water-lawsuit/75851902/ |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=November 15, 2015 |access-date=November 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Bethencourt&gt;{{cite news| first= Daniel| last= Bethencourt| url= http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/11/13/after-flint-water-crisis-families-file-lawsuit/75744376/ |title= After Flint water crisis, families file lawsuit| work= Detroit Free Press| date= November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2015, Mayor Weaver declared the water issue as a citywide public health state of emergency to prompt help from state and federal officials.&lt;ref name=waterwashpost&gt;{{Cite news|title = In Flint, Mich., there's so much lead in children's blood that a state of emergency is declared|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/12/15/toxic-water-soaring-lead-levels-in-childrens-blood-create-state-of-emergency-in-flint-mich/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = December 15, 2015|access-date = December 15, 2015|issn = 0190-8286 |first = Yanan|last = Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Snyder apologized for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Governor Rick Snyder 'very sorry' about Flint water lead levels debacle|url = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/30/michigan-governer-rick-snyder-very-sorry-about-water-supply-debacle|website = The Guardian |location= London |accessdate = December 30, 2015|first = Ryan |last= Felton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Michigan governor apologizes for state's mishandling of Flint's water supply| date = December 30, 2015| url = http://www.rawstory.com/2015/12/michigan-governor-apologizes-for-states-mishandling-of-flints-water-supply/|website = Raw Story| agency= Reuters |accessdate = December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder declared a State of Emergency on January 5, 2016 for [[Genesee County, Michigan]].

On January 16, 2016, Snyder requested that the federal government declare a state of emergency in Flint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Domonske|title = Obama Declares State Of Emergency Over Flint's Contaminated Water|date = January 16, 2016| access-date = January 16, 2016|url = https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/16/463319454/obama-declares-state-of-emergency-over-flints-contaminated-water|first = Camila| website= NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-April 2016, Snyder initiated his own 30-Day Flint Challenge. "The plan was to drink solely Flint tap water for an entire month to show residents that the water was safe and that he cared about the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1= Gross| first1= Allie|title=Remember that time Gov.

Born on 3 April 1884 in [[Brooklyn]], Rose Brenner, the eldest of six siblings, was the daughter of Judge Jacob Brenner and his wife Louise née Blumeneau. Her father played a leading role in local religious activities and politics. Brenner graduated in 1908 with a BA from [[Adelphi College]].&lt;ref name=jwl&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/rose-brenner|title=Rose Brenner (1884-1926)|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate= 28 November 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became active in the Brooklyn Section of the National Council of Jewish Women, serving as president from 1912 to 1918. She went on to become vice-president of the national council in 1915, later becoming national president in 1920.&lt;ref name=jwl/&gt; Under her leadership, the organization not only almost doubled membership but established a National Speakers Bureau and expanded its services for immigrant assistance. It also published Jewish prayer courses, including a prayer book in [[Braille]]. One of her main concerns was to provide support for Jewish immigrants in rural communities in the United States. As a result, in 1920 a Department of Farm and Rural Work was established.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt;

In 1921, she also strengthened the organization by publishing ''The Jewish Woman'', a quarterly, and the monthly ''The Immigrant''. She set up services in support of refugees and created NCJW affiliates in Europe, caring for emigrants intending to go to America.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt; Although she was unable to attend the [[First World Congress of Jewish Women]] in 1923 in [[Vienna]], she sent a strong message of support through her representative [[Estelle Sternberger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://data.onb.ac.at/rec/AC10451064|title= World Congress of Jewish Women, Vienna, May 6—11th, 1923|publisher=Steering Committee of the World Congress of Jewish Women|year=1923|page=12-|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brenner was also an active supporter of the [[Congregation Beth Elohim|Beth Elohim Temple]] where she taught for 20 years and chaired its sisterhood. She served as director of the Women's Foundation for Health under the Brooklyn Board of Education.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt;

Rose Brenner died in Brooklyn of a stroke on 5 April 1926, aged only 42.&lt;ref name=jta/&gt;

'''School debating in Australia''' is primarily organised by The Australian Debating Federation and its eight affiliates. The focus of the debating year is the Australian National Schools Debating Championships, at which the team that is to represent Australia at the [[World Schools Debating Championships]] is selected.

==Australian Debating Federation (ADF)==

The Australian Debating Federation is a body that oversees schools [[debate|debating]] at a national level in Australia.

The ADF has eight affiliate organisations representing the eight states and territories of Australia.  The eight affiliates rotate hosting the annual Australian National Schools Debating Championships (NSDC), which is contested by eight teams selected, trained and managed by each of eight state and territory affiliate associations.

Over 28,000 students across Australia take part in debating events organised by the ADF and its affiliates each year.

===Executive Committee===

The ADF has an Executive Committee which is responsible for the Federation's administration and the development of debating on a national level. The Executive is elected at an AGM comprising representatives from each affiliate organisation, held annually during the NSDC.

==Australian National Schools Debating Championships==

The Australian Debating Federation holds an annual Australian National Schools Debating Championships. The championships, which are contested by eight teams of high school students from each of Australia's eight states and territories, date back to 1971. The tournament uses the World Schools Debating style, and each debate is adjudicated by three nationally accredited adjudicators (with five for the preliminary final, and seven for the Grand Final).

While team selection methods vary from state to state, debaters are generally chosen through trials and workshops held by their state's affiliate to the Australian Debating Federation. Each team consists of four members and (generally) two reserves who may or may not elect to accompany the team to the NSDC tournament. Teams typically train intensively for 3–5 months prior to the tournament.

The tournament is held annually over 8–10 days, roughly rotating around the state and territory capitals. Teams compete in a seven-round competition, with each team debating each other once. At the end of these rounds, the four top-performing teams progress to the final rounds, where they compete in semi-finals, a preliminary final, and a Grand Final.

He was a cousin of opera singer [[Lawrence Tibbett]].

==Career==
[[File:Haywardandriends.jpg|thumb|Hayward, second from left, pictured with his [[Metropolitan Opera]] colleagues, [[Licia Albanese]], [[Frank Guarrera]] (far right) and [[Jerome Hines]].]]
The [[lyric tenor]] made his debut with the [[New York City Opera]] in November 1944, as Edmondo in [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[Manon Lescaut (Puccini)|Manon Lescaut]]'', opposite [[Dorothy Kirsten]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/13225/Manon-Lescaut|title=Manon Lescaut on Broadway - Information, Cast, Crew, Synopsis and Photos|publisher=Playbill Vault|accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1949 recording&lt;br&gt;Giuseppe Antonicelli; Chor &amp; Orchester der Metropolitan Opera&lt;br&gt;Commandante: Osie Hawkins&lt;br&gt;Des Grieux: Jussi Björling&lt;br&gt;Edmondo: Thomas Hayward&lt;br&gt;Geronte: Salvatore Baccaloni&lt;br&gt;Lampionario: Paul Franke&lt;br&gt;Lescaut: Giuseppe Valdengo&lt;br&gt;Maestro del ballo: Alessio de Paolis&lt;br&gt;Manon Lescaut: Dorothy Kirsten&lt;br&gt;Musico: Jean Madeira&lt;br&gt;Oste: George Cehanovsky&lt;br&gt;Sergente: Clifford Harvout&lt;br&gt;Myto 931.73 (2 CD); Naxos historical 8.1110123-24 (2 CD); Cantus Classics 500320 (2 CD) live 103'38&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Universities Tests Act 1871'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1871/cukpga_18710026_en_1 Universities Tests Act 1871], [[UK Government]].&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United Kingdom]] abolished the communion "Tests" and allowed Roman Catholics, non-conformists and non-Christians to take up [[fellow]]ships at the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of London|London]] and [[University of Durham|Durham]].

Passed during the course of [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s first ministry, the act was to obtain support from the non-conformists since these were a major support group for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The direct instigation for this legislation was the widely publicised case of [[Numa Edward Hartog]], the first [[Jewish]] [[Senior Wrangler]] in the history of [[Cambridge University]], who could not accept the fellowship that would otherwise routinely be offered, because he could not [[Thirty-Nine Articles|subscribe to the required test]] on account of his religion. His testimony before the [[House of Lords]] helped secure passage of the bill, after the Lords had twice blocked similar legislation in 1869 and 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|format=PDF|title=Quakers, Jews, and Science: Religious Responses to Modernity and the Sciences in Britain, 1650&amp;ndash;1900|author=Geoffrey Cantor|authorlink=Geoffrey Cantor|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2005|pages=85&amp;ndash;87|isbn=0-19-927668-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vesoul Institut Universitaire de Technologie 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|University Institute of Technology in [[Vesoul]], [[France]].]]
The '''Instituts universitaires de technologie''' or '''IUT''' (translated as "'''University Institutes of Technology'''") are part of the university system in France. The IUT were created in 1966. As of 2008, there are 116 IUTs which are attached to 80 universities including the ones in the French Overseas Territories and Departments.

The IUTs allow the preparation of a two-year [[undergraduate]] technical diploma called a ''Diplôme universitaire de technologie'' or ''DUT''.

After finishing their DUT, students have the option to work, do a one-year professional degree called "Licence Professionnelle" (a course also offered by IUTs), or further their studies in a university or "école".

==History==

The University of Malawi was founded a few months after Malawi Independence.&lt;ref name="sarua1"/&gt; The first enrollment consisted of 90 students in Blantyre.&lt;ref name="sarua1"/&gt; Teaching began in 1965 in [[Blantyre, Malawi|Blantyre]], and within two years the Institute of Public Administration at [[Mpemba]], the Soche Hill College of Education and the Polytechnic in Blantyre, and Bunda College in [[Lilongwe]] became colleges of the university. In 1973, all the constituents of the university apart from the polytechnic and Bunda College moved to Zomba and were merged into Chancellor College. In 1979, Kamuzu College of Nursing became a college of the university, and in 1991 the College of Medicine in Blantyre was formed as a further constituent college.

===Student Movements for Multi-Party Rule (1992)===
During the movement towards multiparty rule, UNIMA students participated in a protest that was organized by themselves as a part of fighting for their educational freedom.&lt;ref name="helsinki1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/pdf-files/vol13num2/chirambo.pdf |title=Afrikka |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1992, when Catholic Bishops in Malawi issued a [[Lenten]] Pastoral Letter that criticized Banda and his government, students of the University of Malawi at [[Chancellor College]] and the Polytechnic joined in through protests and demonstrations in support of the letter.&lt;ref name="helsinki1"/&gt; This forced the authorities to close the campuses.&lt;ref name="helsinki1"/&gt;

===Youth for Freedom and Democracy===

Youth for Freedom and Democracy (YFD) is a student political pressure group on campus. They publish the "Weekly Political Update" that is circulated to students on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110923205117604|title=MALAWI: Police quiz academics over pressure group - University World News|website=www.universityworldnews.com|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been critical of Malawi's governance, and of the [[Paladin Energy]] mining company. In mid September, Malawian police arrested several members of the group. They also arrested 21-year-old Black Moses, president of the YFD and interrogated him. A week later, 25-year-old [[Robert Chasowa]], a fourth-year engineering student at the Malawi Polytechnic was found dead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110928002947/http://www.nyasatimes.com/malawi/2011/09/25/university-student-death-ruled-suicide-police/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; Police ruled this a suicide but critics believe that he was murdered.

The '''Youth Training Scheme''' ('''YTS''') was the name in the [[United Kingdom]] of an on-the-job [[training]] course for school leavers aged 16 and 17 and was managed by the [[Manpower Services Commission]]. The scheme was first outlined in the 1980 [[white paper]] ''A New Training Initiative: A Programme for Action'', and it was brought into operation in 1983 to replace the [[Youth Opportunities Programme]] by the government of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Initially lasting one year or 6 months, the scheme was amended in 1986 to be so that it could be extended to two years.

The [[1981 England riots]] encouraged that, by bringing into sharp focus the results of large numbers of unskilled unemployed finding their own solutions.
The scheme promised training to its applicants and made use of a variety of different training locales such as businesses, colleges of [[further education]] or training workshops run by voluntary organisations. Since the training place was guaranteed by the government and trainees were to be paid if they were on the course, eligibility for [[social security]] [[unemployment benefit]] was withdrawn.

Accredited organisations were required to provide at least 13 weeks per year of training away from the job and include life skills and social skills. A standardised form of certification was issued at the end of the training period.

In 1989, it was renamed '''Youth Training''' and was placed under the management of local [[Training and Enterprise Council]]s. The trainees on the schemes could be classified as either trainee status or employed status.

The difference was distinguished by whether the trainee was recruited by an employer and provided with training for the company needs or if the trainee was being trained by a training organisation using employers as training placements. Often, employed status trainees would have their training allowance improved by the employer.

== Criticism ==
The YTS attracted political and social criticism from an early point. Critics claimed that the scheme enabled employers to exploit school leavers for cheap labour, and it provided little substance in the way of genuine education. The broad left alliance of musicians, artists, comedians and writers, 
[[Red Wedge]], criticised YTS for its discriminatory nature toward black people and women.&lt;ref&gt;“A State of Independence”, Fact Not Fiction Series, no.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The government's line was that the scheme was an effective counter to the drop in [[apprenticeship]]s and marked rise in youth unemployment that was seen in the early 1980s.
