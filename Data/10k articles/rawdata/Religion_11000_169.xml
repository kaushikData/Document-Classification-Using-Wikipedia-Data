      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5068">{{Ahmadiyya|Distinct views}}
In [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya Islam]], '''[[Jihad]]''' is a radical concept. It is primarily one's personal inner and outer struggle for self-purification. Armed struggle or military exertion is the only to be used in defense. However, even then it can only be carried out under the direct instruction of a Caliph, purely for the sake of God and the preservation of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whyahmadi.org/3_10.html |title=Suspension of Jihad |accessdate=September 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414065050/http://www.whyahmadi.org/3_10.html |archivedate=April 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not permissible that jihad be used to spread Islam violently or for political motives, or that it be waged against a government that maintains religious freedom. Political conflicts (even from a defensive stand) over independence, land and resources or reasons other than religious belief cannot be termed jihad. There is a clear distinction, in Ahmadi theology, between Jihad (striving) and ''qitāl'' or ''jihad bil-saif'' (fighting). While Jihad may involve fighting, not all fighting can be called Jihad. Rather, according to Ahmadiyya belief, ''qitāl'' or military jihad  is applicable, only as a defensive measure in very strictly defined circumstances and those circumstances do not exist at present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.muslimsunrise.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=133&amp;Itemid=1 | title=Introduction to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community| accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadiyya claims its objective to be the revival and peaceful propagation of [[Islam]] with special emphasis on defending and extending Islam 'by the pen' and by argumentation. Ahmadis point out that as per prophecy, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] (whom they believe to be the promised messiah) rendered Jihad in its military form as inapplicable in the present age since Islam, as a religion, is not being attacked militarily but through literature and other media, therefore the response should be likewise.

==Spread of faith==
Ahmadis denounce the usage of a sword or any other form of coercion as a method of the propagation of the Islamic faith. In contrast to some of the commonly held views that historically Islam was spread by force, Ahmadis maintain that early Muslims did not take up the sword in order to spread their faith, but rather for the preservation of religion. In particular, the founder of the movement, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad stated that when Islam began gaining converts upon its birth, there was an ever-increasing tension against the new converts by the pagans of Mecca, which resulted in them being severely persecuted for many years. After many years of patience, the Muslim converts migrated to the neighbouring city of Medina. This did not stop persecuting the Muslims. They were pursued by the Pagans and it was only then that the Muslims first took up the sword in order to defend their lives and preserve the religion.&lt;ref name="sword"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alislam.org/jihad/sword.html | title=Jihad with Sword | accessdate=2011-01-16 | publisher=alislam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadis denounce the usage of a sword as an Islamic concept with support from the [[Qur'an]] which according to them categorically rejects any form of coercion in religion. The Qur'an states:
{{Cquote|4=The Qur'an 2:256|''There is no compulsion in religion''}}

==Terrorism==
The fourth Caliph, of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]] states:
{{Cquote|4=''Murder in the Name of Allah'' - Mirza Tahir Ahmad &lt;ref name="terrorism"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alislam.org/terrorism.html | title=Jihad a misunderstood concept | accessdate=2011-01-16 | publisher=alislam.org| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101228001530/http://www.alislam.org/terrorism.html| archivedate= 28 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;|''As far as Islam is concerned, it categorically rejects and condemns every form of terrorism. It does not provide any cover or justification for any act of violence, be it committed by an individual, a group or a government..... I most strongly condemn all acts and forms of terrorism because it is my deeply rooted belief that not only Islam but also no true religion, whatever its name, can sanction violence and bloodshed of innocent men, women and children in the name of God''}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2926">'''Anteias''' or '''Antias''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀντείας}} or {{lang-grc|Ἀντίας}}) was in [[Roman mythology]] a figure in some versions of Rome's foundation myth. He was one of the three sons of [[Odysseus]] by [[Circe]], and brother to [[Rhomos]] and [[Ardeas]], each of whom were said to have founded a major Roman city, much like the [[Romulus and Remus]] myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Malkin | first =Irad | authorlink =Irad Malkin | title =The Returns of Odysseus: Colonization and Ethnicity | publisher =[[University of California Press]] | date =1998 | pages =188 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=8eORbgLB6a4C | isbn = 9780520920262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of Anteia or Antium in Italy (modern [[Anzio]]) was said to have been founded by, and taken its name from, this Anteias.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] i. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] ''s. v.'' Ἄντεια&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aparajita''' was an eighth century ''[[Digambara monk]]''.

==Biography==
Aparajita was an eighth century ''[[Digambara monk]]'' who defended the practice of ''Digambara monks'' of being nude. His explanation reduced ''[[Śvētāmbara]]'' monks and nuns to the status of lay people.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=49-50}} He explained that ''Digambara'' does not mean just being nude, instead it means "abandonment of all possessions", the desire to possess things, and the fear of losing them.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=50}}

==Early life==
Huffington was born Ariadnē-Anna Stasinopoúlou&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/11/arianna-huffington-to-leave-huffington-post-thrive|title=Arianna Huffington to leave Huffington Post for startup Thrive|last=York|first=Jasper Jackson Sam Thielman in New|date=2016-08-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=April 2017}} ({{lang|el|Αριάδνη-Άννα Στασινοπούλου}}) in [[Athens]], [[Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/arianna-huffington/|title=Arianna Huffington|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of Konstantinos (a journalist and management consultant) and Elli (née Georgiadi) Stasinopoulou, and is the sister of Agapi (an author, speaker and performer).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/health/found-sister-arianna-huffington-lying-pool-blood-knew-had-help/|title='I found my sister, Arianna Huffington, lying in a pool of blood and knew I had to help'|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to the [[United Kingdom]] at the age of 16 and studied [[economics]] at [[Girton College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], where she was the first foreign, and third female&lt;ref name="Talbot, Margaret 1998 page 40-47"&gt;Talbot, Margaret (April 13, 1998), "The Politics of Fame."

She also studied Comparative religion from [[Visva-Bharati University]], [[Santiniketan]]. She told IANS in an email interview "India has long held a special place in my heart, from the time I went to study comparative religion at [[Visva-Bharati University]], [[Santiniketan]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/india-has-much-to-offer-in-wellness-space-arianna-huffington-ians-interview-118081900149_1.html|title=India has much to offer in wellness space: Arianna Huffington (IANS Interview)|first=|last=IANS|date=August 19, 2018|publisher=|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Huffington appeared in an edition of ''[[Face the Music (TV series)|Face the Music]]'' along with [[Bernard Levin]]. A relationship developed, of which she wrote, after his death: "He wasn't just the big love of my life, he was a mentor as a writer and a role model as a thinker."&lt;ref name=arianna&gt;Stassinopoulos-Huffington, Arianna. [http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:LSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1048B56C780D22EF&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggdocs&amp;req_dat=102CDD40F14C6BDA "The Odd Couple",] ''The Sunday Times'', August 15, 2004, accessed June 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Huffington began writing books in the 1970s, with editorial help from Levin.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The two traveled to music festivals around the world for the [[BBC]]. They spent summers patronizing three-star restaurants in [[France]]. At the age of 30, she remained deeply in love with him but longed to have children; Levin never wanted to marry or have children. Huffington concluded that she had to break away and moved to [[New York City|New York]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=arianna /&gt;

From March - April 1980, Huffington joined [[Bob Langley]] as the co-host of [[BBC1]]'s late night talk and entertainment show ''Saturday Night At The Mill'', appearing in just 5 editions before being dropped from the programme.&lt;ref&gt;https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?order=asc&amp;q=saturday+night+at+the+mill+arianna#search&lt;/ref&gt; She was replaced eventually permanently by [[Jenny Hanley]]&lt;ref&gt;https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?order=asc&amp;q=saturday+night+at+the+mill+hanley#search&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1973, Arianna (as Stasinopoúlou) wrote a book titled ''The Female Woman'', attacking the Women's Liberation movement in general and [[Germaine Greer]]'s 1970 ''[[The Female Eunuch]]'' in particular. In the book she wrote, "Women's Lib claims that the achievement of total liberation would transform the lives of all women for the better; the truth is that it would transform only the lives of women with strong lesbian tendencies."&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Laura (October 13, 2008) [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/10/13/the-oracle-lauren-collins "The Oracle."] ''New Yorker.'' (Retrieved 8-6-014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Polydor Records released a solo album by [[Irene Papas]] entitled ''[[Odes (album)|Odes]]'', with music performed (and partly composed) by [[Vangelis]] Papathanassiou. The words for the album were co-written by Arianna Stassinopoulos.

In the late 1980s, Huffington wrote several articles for ''[[National Review]]''. In 1981, she wrote a biography of [[Maria Callas]], ''Maria Callas&amp;nbsp;– The Woman Behind the Legend'', and in 1989, a biography of [[Pablo Picasso]], ''Picasso: Creator and Destroyer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Huffington, Arianna |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1988/06/picasso-creator-and-destroyer/5715/ |title=Picasso: Creator and Destroyer |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=June 1988 |accessdate=December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huffington rose to national U.S. prominence during the unsuccessful Senate bid in 1994 by her then husband, Michael Huffington, a Republican. She became known as a reliable supporter of conservative causes such as [[Newt Gingrich]]'s "[[Republican Revolution]]" and [[Bob Dole]]'s 1996 [[United States presidential election, 1996|candidacy for president]]. She teamed up with [[liberalism|liberal]] [[comedian]] [[Al Franken]] as the conservative half of "Strange Bedfellows"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-tv/strange-bedfellows_b_41316.html |title=Huff TV: Strange Bedfellows |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=February 14, 2007 |accessdate=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; during [[Comedy Central]]'s coverage of the 1996 U.S. presidential election. For her work, she and the writing team of ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' were nominated for a 1997 [[Emmy]] for Outstanding Writing for a Variety or Music Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/politically-incorrect-bill-maher-0 |title=Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher |work=Television Academy |accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as 1998, Huffington still aligned herself with Republicans. During that year, she did a weekly radio show in Los Angeles called "[[Left, Right, &amp; Center]]", that "match[ed] her, the so-called 'right-winger', against self-described centrist policy wonk [[Matthew Miller (journalist)|Matt Miller]], and veteran 'leftist' journalist Robert Scheer."&lt;ref name="Talbot, Margaret 1998 page 40-47" /&gt; In an April 1998 profile in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Margaret Talbot]] wrote that "Most recently, she has cast herself as a kind of Republican Spice Girl – an endearingly ditzy right wing gal-about-town who is a guilty pleasure for people who know better." Huffington described herself by side-stepping the traditional party divide, saying "the right/left divisions are so outdated now. For me, the primary division is between people who are aware of what I call 'the two nations' (rich and poor), and those who are not."&lt;ref name="Talbot, Margaret 1998 page 40-47" /&gt;

Huffington, of Greek background, opposed [[NATO]] intervention against [[Serbia]] during the [[Yugoslav Wars]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/1999/12/17/kosovo_12/ |title=Arianna Huffington is dead wrong |publisher= |accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2000, she instigated the "Shadow Conventions"{{clarify|date=January 2013}}, which appeared at the [[2000 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in [[Philadelphia]] and the [[2000 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in [[Los Angeles]] at [[Bob Hope Patriotic Hall|Patriotic Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/news2000/0619-11.htm |title=Shadow Conventions 2000 |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=June 19, 2000 |accessdate=April 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026040923/http://www.commondreams.org/news2000/0619-11.htm |archivedate=October 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arianna Huffington thumb.jpg|thumb|Campaigning for [[Governor of California]], 2003]]

Huffington headed [[The Detroit Project]], a public interest group [[lobbying]] automakers to start producing cars running on [[alternative fuel]]s. The project's 2003 TV ads, which equated driving [[sport utility vehicle]]s to funding [[terrorism]], proved to be particularly controversial, with some stations refusing to run them.&lt;ref&gt;Seelye, Katharine.

She is also a [[One Young World]] Counsellor, speaking to delegates at summits in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]] in 2013 and [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] in 2014.

===California recall election participation===
Huffington was an [[political independent|independent]] candidate in the [[California recall election, 2003|2003 recall election]] of California Governor [[Gray Davis]]. She described her candidacy against frontrunner [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as "the [[hybrid car|hybrid]] versus the [[Hummer]]", making reference to her ownership of a hybrid vehicle, the [[Toyota Prius]], and Schwarzenegger's Hummer. The two would proceed to have a high-profile clash during the election's [[debate]], during which both candidates were rebuked for making personal attacks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

She dropped out of the race on September 30, 2003, and endorsed Governor Gray Davis' campaign to vote against the recall. Polls showed that only about 2 percent of likely California voters planned to vote for her at the time of her withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Huffington withdraws from recall race |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/09/30/calif.recall/ |agency=CNN |publisher=CNN.com |location=Los Angeles |date=September 30, 2003 |accessdate=September 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though she failed to stop the recall, Huffington's name remained on the [[ballot]] and she [[California recall election, 2003#Results|placed 5th]], capturing 47,505 votes or 0.55% of the vote.

===Presence in media===

Huffington at one point was the co-host of the weekly, nationally syndicated, [[public radio]] program ''Both Sides Now'', along with [[Mary Matalin]], former top aide to the George W. Bush White House. Every week on ''Both Sides Now'', Huffington and Matalin discussed the nation's relevant political issues, offering both sides of every issue to the listeners. ''Both Sides Now'' was hosted by former [[Air America Radio]] President and ''HuffPost'' blogger [[Mark J. Green]].&lt;ref name="bothsides" /&gt;

Prior to ''The Huffington Post'', Huffington hosted a website called AriannaOnline.com. Her first foray into the Internet was a website called Resignation.com, which called for the resignation of President [[Bill Clinton]] and was a rallying place for conservatives opposing Clinton. About Clinton resigning, she wrote, "Only some act of sacrifice can begin to restore the image of the President that we are left with from the [[Starr report]] - a man of staggering [[narcissism]] and self-indulgence, whom nobody dared gainsay, investing his energies first in gratifying his sexual greeds and then in using his staff, his friends, and the Secret Service to cover up the truth."&lt;ref&gt;(December 16, 1998) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/talk/zforum/huffington121698.htm "Direct Access: Arianna Huffington."] ''[[The Washington Post]]''.

In November 2008, Huffington joined the cast of [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s animated series, ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', where she lends her voice to the wife of [[Tim the Bear]], also named [[List of The Cleveland Show characters#Arianna the Bear|Arianna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fox Seems Keen on ''Cleveland'' |url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2008/11/fox_seems_keen_on_cleveland.php |last=Adalian |first=Josef |date=November 2008 |accessdate=September 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huffington was spoofed by actress [[Tracey Ullman]] in her [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] comedy series ''[[Tracey Ullman's State of the Union]]''. Huffington spoke glowingly of the impersonation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/10/13/the-oracle-lauren-collins |title=The many lives of Arianna Huffington. |publisher=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huffington was further impersonated by actresses [[Michaela Watkins]] and [[Nasim Pedrad]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/video/clips/update-arianna-huffington/848661/ |title=Saturday Night Live – Update: Arianna Huffington – Video |publisher=NBC.com |accessdate=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huffington appeared as herself in the May 10, 2010, episode of the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]''.

Huffington participated in the 24th annual "Distinguished Speaker Series" at the [[University at Buffalo]], NY, on September 16, 2010. She headlined a debate against radio co-host Mary Matalin on current world events, political issues, and the local Buffalo economy. The University at Buffalo "Distinguished Speaker Series" has featured a multitude of world-renowned politicians and celebrities such as; [[Tony Blair]], [[Bill Nye]], [[Jon Stewart]], and [[the Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Past Speakers |publisher=University of Buffalo |url=http://www.student-affairs.buffalo.edu/special/pastspeakers.php |accessdate=October 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116071758/http://www.student-affairs.buffalo.edu/special/pastspeakers.php |archive-date=January 16, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huffington offered to provide as many buses as necessary to transport those who wanted to go to Jon Stewart's [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]] on October 30, 2010, from ''The Huffington Post'' headquarters in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/02/the-daily-show-and-colber_n_748014.html |title=The Daily Show And Colbert Report React To Arianna's 'HuffPost Sanity Bus' Announcement (VIDEO) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=October 2, 2010 |accessdate=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, she paid for 150 buses to ferry almost 10,000 people from Citi Field in Queens to [[RFK Stadium]] in DC.

Huffington played herself in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Brian Writes a Bestseller]]" along with [[Dana Gould]] and [[Bill Maher]] in a [[live action|live]] segment of ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]''.

In 2012, Huffington became a [[LinkedIn]] Influencer, writing about success and sharing professional insights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kovach, Steve |title=Now You Can Follow Influential People On LinkedIn Without Them Following You Back |work=Business Insider |date=October 2, 2012 |accessdate=July 30, 2013 |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-today-original-content-2012-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of plagiarism==
Huffington was accused of [[plagiarism]] for copying material for her book ''Maria Callas'' (1981); the claims were settled out of court in 1981, with Callas' biographer Gerald Fitzgerald being paid "in the low five figures".&lt;ref name="Orth, Maureen 2005 Page 117"&gt;Orth, Maureen (2005) ''The Importance of Being Famous.'' MacMillon. Page 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oney, Steve (October 2004) "The Many Faces of Arianna." ''Los Angeles Magazine''.

Lydia Gasman, an art history professor at the [[University of Virginia]], claimed that Huffington's 1988 biography of [[Pablo Picasso]], ''Picasso: Creator and Destroyer'', included themes similar to those in her unpublished four-volume PhD thesis. "What she did was steal twenty years of my work", Gasman told Maureen Orth in 1994. Gasman did not file suit.&lt;ref name=collinsnewyorker /&gt;

Columnist [[Maureen Orth]] also claimed that Huffington "borrowed heavily for her 1993 book, ''The Gods of Greece''".&lt;ref name="Orth, Maureen 2005 Page 117" /&gt;

==Religious views==
Huffington has had a lifelong interest in spirituality; in her youth, together with Bernard Levin, she explored the [[Rajneesh movement]], later dating [[Erhard Seminars Training|est]] founder [[Werner Erhard]] and going on to become affiliated with [[John-Roger Hinkins]]' [[Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness]].&lt;ref name=collinsnewyorker&gt;{{cite news|author=Lauren Collins|title=The Oracle.

==Personal life==

Huffington met her husband [[Michael Huffington]] in 1985.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} They were married a year later, on April 12, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/15/arianna-huffington-turns-62_n_1672282.html |title=Arianna Huffington Turns 62 |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=July 15, 2012 |accessdate=September 2, 2012 |first=Rita |last=Wilson}} See the captions to pictures 15 and 16.&lt;/ref&gt; They have two daughters, Isabella and Christina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3217">The '''Ashkenaz Foundation''' is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. Its purpose is to increase awareness of [[Yiddish]] and [[Jewish]] culture through the arts.  The foundation organizes and sponsors a biennial festival, and has a year-round programme which showcases the work of contemporary artists from Canada and around the world, with a particular focus on music.

==History==

The Ashkenaz Foundation was founded in 1995, with a mandate to promote [[Klezmer]], [[Yiddish]] and east European [[Jewish]] cultural arts, as well as other manifestations of global [[Jewish]] music and culture, including Israeli, Sephardic, Ladino, and Mizrahi Jewish traditions. That year the foundation organized the first Ashkenaz Festival.

Ashkenaz has sponsored fusion and cross-cultural exchange with artists from outside [[Jewish]] cultural traditions through commissioned works and special projects. Ashkenaz promotes local and emerging talent, and takes part in education and community outreach.  Most Ashkenaz presentations are presented free to the public.

==Ashkenaz Festival==
The '''Ashkenaz Festival'''  The Festival takes place biennially at Toronto's [[Harbourfront Centre]] and satellite locations throughout Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/the-ashkenaz-festival-emc/ "The Ashkenaz Festival"]. Janis Seftel 12/26/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Each edition showcases approximately 50-75 acts from Canada and around the world, and includes music, theatre, dance, film, literature, craft, and visual arts. The Festival draws an audience of about 60,000 people and has grown to be the largest Jewish cultural event in Canada.

The first Ashkenaz Festival took place in July 1995, and was focused on Klezmer and Yiddish revival music.&lt;ref name=kabatay&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/09/05/ashkenaz-fest-takes-jewish-culture-global.html "Ashkenaz fest takes Jewish culture global"].

The 7th Ashkenaz Festival in August 2008 celebrated the organization's "[[Bar Mitzvah]]" year (13th year). The August 2014 iteration celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Foundation, and the 10th biennial Festival. Over time the festival has expanded to include many genres of [[world music]].&lt;ref name=kabatay /&gt;

'''Axial Age''' (also '''Axis Age''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Introducing Philosophy of Religion | last =Meister | first = Chad | year= 2009 | publisher= Routledge | location = Abingdon | pages=10 | isbn=0-203-88002-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-de|Achsenzeit}}) is a term coined by [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]] [[Karl Jaspers]] in the sense of a  "pivotal age" characterizing the period of [[ancient history]] from about the 8th to the 3rd century BCE.

Then, according to Jaspers' concept, new ways of thinking appeared in [[History of Iran|Persia]], [[History of India|India]], [[Zhou dynasty|China]] and the [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Roman world]] in [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], in a striking parallel development, without any obvious direct cultural contact between all of the participating [[Eurasia]]n cultures. Jaspers identified key thinkers from this age who had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. 

Jaspers' approach to the culture of the middle of the [[first millennium BC]] has been adopted by other scholars and academics, and has become a point of discussion in the [[history of religion]].

==Definition==
Jaspers introduced the concept of an Axial Age in his book ''Vom Ursprung und Ziel der Geschichte'' (''The Origin and Goal of History''&lt;ref name="Jaspers"&gt;Karl Jaspers, '' Origin and Goal of History'', Routledge Revivals, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0415578806}}&lt;/ref&gt;), published in 1949. The simultaneous appearance of thinkers and philosophers in different areas of the world had been remarked by numerous authors since the 18th century, notably by the French Indologist [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]].&lt;ref name="Metzler2009" /&gt; Jaspers explicitly cited some of these authors, including [[Victor von Strauß]] (1859) and [[Peter Ernst von Lasaulx ]](1870).&lt;ref name="Metzler2009"&gt;{{cite journal

Jasper's contribution was to claim that the Axial Age should be viewed as an objective empirical fact of history, independently of religious considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Jaspers K.,''The Origin and Goal of History'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that during the Axial Age, "the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently in China, India, Persia, Judea, and Greece. And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jaspers | first = Karl | title = The Way to Wisdom : An Introduction to Philosophy | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2003 | location = New Haven, CT |page=98 | isbn = 0-300-09735-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IfAgyKFpWaEC&amp;pg=PA98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He identified a number of key thinkers as having had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. Jaspers held up this age as unique, and one to which the rest of the [[history of ideas|history of human thought]] might be compared.

==Characteristics==
Jaspers presented his first outline of the Axial age by a series of examples:

{{quote|[[Confucius]] and [[Lao-Tse]] were living in China, all the schools of Chinese philosophy came into being, including those of [[Mo Ti]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Chuang Tse]], [[Lieh Tzu]] and a host of others; India produced the [[Upanishads]] and [[Buddha]] and, like China, ran the whole gamut of philosophical possibilities down to [[materialism]], [[scepticism]] and [[nihilism]]; in Iran [[Zarathustra]] taught a challenging view of the world as a struggle between good and evil; in Palestine the prophets made their appearance from [[Elijah]] by way of [[Isaiah]] and [[Jeremiah]] to [[Deutero-Isaiah]]; Greece witnessed the appearance of [[Homer]], of the philosophers – [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]] and [[Plato]], – of the tragedians, of [[Thucydides]] and [[Archimedes]]. Everything implied by these names developed during these few centuries almost simultaneously in China, India and the West.|Karl Jaspers, ''Origin and Goal of History'', p. 2}}
[[File:Karl Jaspers 1946.jpg|thumb|258x258px|Jaspers argued that the Axial Age gave birth to philosophy as a discipline]]
Jaspers described the Axial Age as "an interregnum between two ages of great [[empire]], a pause for [[liberty]], a deep breath bringing the most lucid consciousness".&lt;ref name="Jaspers51"&gt;{{Harvnb | Jaspers | 1953 | p = 51}} quoted in {{Harvnb | Armstrong | 2006 | p = 367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the Axial Age was a historically [[Liminality|liminal]] period, when old certainties had lost their validity and new ones were still not ready.&lt;ref name = "Thomassen"&gt;{{citation | last = Thomassen | first= Bjorn | authorlink= Bjorn Thomassen | journal = Anthropological Theory |volume = 10 | number = 4 | year=2010 | pages = 321–42 | title = Anthropology, multiple modernities and the axial age debate | url= http://ant.sagepub.com/content/10/4/321.full.pdf+html | doi= 10.1177/1463499610386659}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Jaspers had a particular interest in the similarities in circumstance and thought of its figures. Similarities included an engagement in the quest for human meaning&lt;ref name = "Neville"&gt;{{cite book | last = Neville | first = Robert Cummings | title=Religion in Late Modernity | url= https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN079145424X&amp;id=OWkrdZ2yh3EC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;vq=%22Axial+Age | year = 2002 | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn =0-7914-5424-X | page = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of a new [[elite]] class of religious leaders and thinkers in China, India and the Occident.&lt;ref name="Eisenstadt"&gt;{{cite book | last= Eisenstadt | first= SN | authorlink = Shmuel Eisenstadt | title = The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations | year=1986 | publisher= SUNY Press | isbn = 0-88706-094-3 | pages=1–2 | chapter = Introduction | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0887060943&amp;id=OFGIYBK2hu8C&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These spiritual foundations were laid by individual thinkers within a framework of a changing social environment. Jaspers argues that the characteristics appeared under similar political circumstances: China, India, the Middle East and the Occident each comprised multiple small states engaged in internal and external struggles.
The three regions all gave birth to, and then institutionalized, a tradition of travelling scholars, who roamed from city to city to exchange ideas. After the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and the [[Warring States period]], [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]] emerged in China. In other regions, the scholars were largely from extant religious traditions; in India, from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]; in Persia, from [[Zoroastrianism]]; in [[The Levant]], from [[Judaism]]; and in Greece, from [[Sophist|Sophism]] and other classical philosophies.

Many of the cultures of the axial age were considered second-generation societies because they were built on the societies that preceded them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart |last=Pollard |last2=Rosenberg |last3=Tignor |first= Elizabeth |first2=Clifford |first3=Robert|publisher = Norton|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-393-91847-2|location = NewYork|pages = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thinkers and movements==
[[Parshvanatha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = Mary Pat | title =Living Religions: An Encyclopedia of the World's Faiths | publisher = IB Tauris | year =1997 | location = London | isbn = 1-86064-148-2 | page = 115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia  | title =Parshvanatha  | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica  | volume = Online  | year =2007  | url =http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9058576  | accessdate = 2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (23rd Tirthankara in the 9th century BCE) and [[Mahavira]] (24th [[Tirthankara]] in the 6th century BCE), known as the [[fordmaker]]s of [[Jainism]] lived during this age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Mahavira | title = Britannica Concise Encyclopedia | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | year = 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Answers | date = 28 Nov 2009 | url = http://www.answers.com/topic/mahavira | title = Mahavira}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They propagated the religion of [[sramana]]s (previous Tirthankaras) and influenced [[Indian philosophy]] by propounding the principles of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (non-violence), [[Karma in Jainism|karma]],  [[samsara]] and [[asceticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Zydenbos | first = Robert J | authorlink = Robert J. Zydenbos | title = Jainism Today and Its Future | publisher = Manya Verlag | year =2006 | location = München | url =http://www.manyaverlag.de/jtaif.html | pages = 11, 56–57, 59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]], also of the sramana tradition of India, was another of the world's most influential philosophies, founded by [[Siddhartha Gautama]], or the Buddha, who lived during this period; its spread was aided by [[Ashoka]], who lived late in the period.

In China, the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] were in contention and [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] arose during this era, and in this area it remains a profound influence on social and religious life.

[[Zoroastrianism]], another of Jaspers' examples, is one of the first monotheistic religions and some believe it greatly influenced modern Abrahamic religions with such conceptions as the devil and Heaven/Hell.&lt;ref name = "Boyce1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyce|first= Mary | authorlink = Mary Boyce | title = Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices| publisher= Routledge| location= London| year= 1979 | isbn = 0-415-23903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date of [[Zoroaster]]'s life is debated by scholars, with some, such as Mary Boyce, arguing that Zoroastrianism itself is significantly older.&lt;ref name= "Boyce1979" /&gt; Others, such as William W Malandra and RC Zaehner, suggest that he may indeed have been an early contemporary of Cyrus living around 600 BC.&lt;ref name = "Malandra1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malandra|first=William|authorlink=William W. Malandra|title=An Introduction to Ancient Iranian Religion|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location= Minneapolis|year=1983|isbn = 0-8166-1114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Boyce and other leading scholars who once supported much earlier dates for Zarathustra/Zoroaster have recently changed their position on the time when he likely lived, so that there is an emerging consensus regarding him as a contemporary or near-contemporary of [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref name = "B.A. Brown 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Brian Arthur | authorlink = Brian Arthur Brown | title = Three Testaments: Torah, Gospel, and Quran | publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield | location= Lanham, MD | year= 2012 | pages = 23–24 | isbn = 978-1-4422-1492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaspers' axial shifts included the rise of [[Platonism]], which would later become a major influence on the Western world through both [[Christianity]] and secular thought throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]].

==Reception==
In addition to Jaspers, the philosopher [[Eric Voegelin]] referred to this age as ''The Great Leap of Being'', constituting a new spiritual awakening and a shift of perception from societal to individual values.&lt;ref name = "Voegelin1985"&gt;{{cite book| last= Voegelin|first= Eric|authorlink= Eric Voegelin| series= Collected Works | volume = 18 | title=Order and History (Volume V): In Search of Order|location=Columbia, [[Missouri|MO]] | publisher = The University of Missouri Press| year= 2000| origyear= 1985| isbn= 978-0-8262-1261-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers and teachers like the Buddha, [[Pythagoras]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Parmenides]], and [[Anaxagoras]] contributed to such awakenings which Plato would later call ''[[anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]'', or a remembering of things forgotten.

[[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] notes that the first "universal religions" appeared in the age of the first universal [[empire]]s and of the first all-encompassing [[trading network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Christian | first1 = David | author-link1 = David Christian (historian) | title = Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VUqZl7RdNtwC | series = California World History Library | volume = 2 | publisher = University of California Press | publication-date = 2004 | page = 319 | isbn = 978-0-520-23500-7 | accessdate = 2013-12-29 | quote = Not until the first millennium BCE do the first universal religions appear. Though associated in practice with particular dynasties or empires, they proclaimed universal truths and worshiped all-powerful gods. It is no accident that universal religions appeared when both empires and exchange networks reached to the edge of the known universe. Nor is it an accident that one of the earliest religions of this type, Zoroastrianism, appeared in the largest empire of the mid-first millennium BCE, that of the Achaemenids, and at the hub of trade routes that were weaving Afro-Eurasia into a single world system. Indeed, most of the universal religions appeared in the hub region between Mesopotamia and northern India. They included Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism in Persia, Buddhism in India, Confucianism in China, and Judaism, Christianity and Islam in the Mediterranean world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] [[David Graeber]] has pointed out that "the core period of Jasper's Axial age [...] corresponds almost exactly to the period in which coinage was invented.  What's more, the three parts of the world where coins were first invented were also the very parts of the world where those sages lived; in fact, they became the epicenters of Axial Age religious and philosophical creativity."&lt;ref name = "Graeber"&gt;{{Harvnb | Graeber | 2011 | p = 224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the work of classicist [[Richard Seaford]] and literary theorist [[Marc Shell]] on the relation between coinage and early Greek thought, Graeber argues that an understanding of the rise of markets is necessary to grasp the context in which the religious and philosophical insights of the Axial age arose. The ultimate effect of the introduction of coinage was, he argues, an "ideal division of spheres of human activity that endures to this day: on the one hand the market, on the other, religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Graeber | 2011 | p = 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German sociologist [[Max Weber]] played an important role in Jaspers' thinking.&lt;ref name= "Stanford"&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | title = Karl Jaspers | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/jaspers/ | accessdate= 2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Szakolczai"&gt;{{cite book | first=Arpad | last=Szakolczai | year=2003 | title=The Genesis of Modernity | edition= First hardcover | publisher =Routledge | location=UK | isbn=0-415-25305-5 | pages=80–81 | url = https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415253055&amp;id=hGduSwFHFSEC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=Jaspers+%22Axial+Age%22+characteristics&amp;sig=O9S_5-pSxgMIPz8Ocn8RrgofkPU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "EoST"&gt;{{cite book | first=Arpad | last=Szakolczai | year=2006 | title=Encyclopedia of Social Theory | chapter = Historical sociology | publisher = Routledge | location=UK | isbn=0-415-29046-5|chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415290465&amp;id=LrBrWXtez8YC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;vq=Axial+Age&amp;dq=%22The+Axial+Age:+The+Emergence+of+Transcendental+Visions+and+the+Rise+of+Clerics%22&amp;sig=g0mBSYAPnOEiXYGHR-j8hpuQPVM | page = 251}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] argues in the introduction to ''The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations'' that Weber's work in his ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'', ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]]'' and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'' provided a background for the importance of the period, and notes parallels with [[Eric Voegelin]]'s ''Order and History''.&lt;ref name="Eisenstadt" /&gt; Wider acknowledgement of Jaspers' work came after it was presented at a conference and published in ''[[Daedalus (journal)|Dædalus]]'' in 1975, and Jaspers' suggestion that the period was uniquely transformative generated important discussion amongst other scholars, such as Johann Arnason.&lt;ref name = "EoST" /&gt; In literature, [[Gore Vidal]] in his novel [[Creation (novel)|''Creation'']] covers much of this Axial Age through the fictional perspective of a Persian adventurer.

[[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] analyses economic circumstances relating to the coming of the Axial Age in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WsUKbgh_A1YC|title=The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations|publisher=SUNY Press|year=|isbn=9781438401942|series=SUNY series in Near Eastern Studies|location=|publication-date=2012|page=31|pages=|chapter=Introduction: The Axial Age Breakthrough in Ancient Greece|quote=The emergence of this specific type of Axial Age breakthrough was connected with the special mode of disintegration of the tribal communities and of construction of new collectivities and institutional complexes. [...] In the economic field, we find a growing occupational differentiation between the economic ties to the land and the urban vocations, be they in trade, craft, industry, or the ritual and educational fields. This phenomenon was also very closely connected with the development of many free economic resources - partially even land and manpower resources -  not bound to ascriptive social units, the concomitant development of widespread internal and external, relatively free, market activities, and the accumulation of relatively mobile capital.|last1=Eisenstadt|first1=Shmuel N.|editor1-last=Eisenstadt|editor1-first=Shmuel N.|accessdate=2015-06-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious historian [[Karen Armstrong]] explored the period in her ''The Great Transformation'',&lt;ref name= "Armstrong"&gt;{{cite book | first = Karen | last=Armstrong | authorlink=Karen Armstrong | year= 2006 | title= The Great Transformation: The Beginning of our Religious Traditions | edition=First | publisher=Knopf | location=New York | isbn= 0-676-97465-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the theory has been the focus of academic conferences.&lt;ref name="Conference"&gt;{{cite web|author=Strath, Bo |year=2005 |title=Axial Transformations |url=http://www.iue.it/Personal/Strath/Welcome.html?/Personal/Strath/archive/past_conferences/axialtrans.htm |accessdate=2006-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233849/http://www.iue.it/Personal/Strath/Welcome.html?%2FPersonal%2FStrath%2Farchive%2Fpast_conferences%2Faxialtrans.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the term has expanded beyond Jaspers' original formulation. Armstrong argues that the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] was a "Second Axial Age", including thinkers such as [[Isaac Newton]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Albert Einstein]]. It has also been suggested that the [[modern era]] is a new axial age, wherein relationships between religion, secularity, and traditional thought are changing.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;{{cite journal | first =Yves | last = Lambert | title= Religion in Modernity as a New Axial Age: Secularization or New Religious Forms? | journal=Sociology of Religion | year=1999 | volume=60 | issue= | pages= 303|url = https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=98493653 | doi= 10.2307/3711939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles''', are a [[Roman Catholic religious order]], in [[Gower, Missouri]] in the United States. The nuns sing together, as part of their daily life of prayer. The group have released a number of recordings of their songs. Both their first two albums of their recorded chants and hymns reached number 1 on the classical traditional [[Billboard charts]] in 2013. They were named Billboard's Classical Traditional Artist 2012 and 2013, the first order of nuns to win an award in the history of Billboard magazine.

The community was established in 1995 as a small order of [[Benedictine]] [[nun]]s under the auspices of the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]], in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Scranton]], [[Pennsylvania]]. They were originally called the [[Oblate]]s of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], Queen of Apostles. They began following a monastic [[horarium]] defined in the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], and [[Gregorian chant|chanting]] the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] in Latin according to the 1962 ''Breviarium Monasticum''.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benedictinesofmary.org/content/about-ephesus|title=About Ephesus|publisher=Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles|accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrival in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-Saint Joseph]] in 2005, Bishop [[Robert Finn (bishop)|Robert Finn]] said that [[vocation]]s to the priesthood and [[Religious (Catholicism)|religious]] life would be seen as a "super-priority" for his diocese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familyvocationsconference.com/project/vocations-to-priesthood-and-consecrated-life-a-super-priority/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130809150207/http://familyvocationsconference.com/project/vocations-to-priesthood-and-consecrated-life-a-super-priority/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-08-09|title=Vocations to Priesthood and Consecrated Life: a Super-Priority|date=2012-07-14|publisher=Our Lady of Lourdes Vocation Conference|accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006, Finn invited the order to the diocese, who were established as a public [[association of the faithful]] with the new name "Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles".&lt;ref name=about/&gt; 

In September 2018, its priory was raised to [[abbey]] and their new Abbey Church was consecrated by Bishop Robert Finn. Mother Cecilia was the first abbess to received the Abbatial Blessing according to the traditional [[Pontificale]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="abbey"&gt;{{cite web |title=This Is The House Of The Lord, Firmly Established |url=https://catholickey.org/2018/09/14/this-is-the-house-of-the-lord-firmly-established/ |website=Catholic Key |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Big Love''''' is an American television drama series that aired on [[HBO]] between March 2006 and March 2011.  It stars [[Bill Paxton]] as the patriarch of a [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormon]] family in contemporary [[Utah]] who practices [[polygamy]], with [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]], [[Chloë Sevigny]], and [[Ginnifer Goodwin]] portraying his wives. The series charts the family's life in and out of the public sphere in their [[Salt Lake City]] suburb, as well as their associations with a fundamentalist compound in the area. It features key supporting performances from [[Amanda Seyfried]], [[Grace Zabriskie]], [[Daveigh Chase]], [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Mary Kay Place]], [[Bruce Dern]], [[Melora Walters]], and [[Harry Dean Stanton]].

The series premiered in the United States on March 12, 2006, following the sixth-season premiere of the HBO series ''[[The Sopranos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5254450|work=NPR|title=HBO's 'Big Love': My Three Wives|author=Neary, Lynn|date=March 9, 2006|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Big Love'' was a success for HBO, running for five seasons before concluding its run on March 20, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118026514?refCatId=14 |title=HBO Cancels 'Big Love'|work=Variety|date= October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Big Love'' received widespread critical acclaim, and earned several major awards and nominations throughout its run. The third season was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series]], and the first three were nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series - Drama]].&lt;ref name=gg&gt;{{cite web|work=Golden Globes|publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/tv-show/big-love|accessdate=January 22, 2018|title=Big Love}}&lt;/ref&gt; For acting, Chloë Sevigny won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in the series' third season, and Bill Paxton was nominated three times for his leading role.&lt;ref name=gg/&gt; At the Emmys, [[Ellen Burstyn]], Bruce Dern, Mary Kay Place, and [[Sissy Spacek]] were all nominated for their recurring roles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Emmys|publisher=Television Academy|title=Big Love|url=https://www.emmys.com/shows/big-love|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the series' creators [[Mark V. Olsen]] and [[Will Scheffer]] won the [[Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Episodic Drama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12421072|work=NPR|title=Mark Olsen and Will Scheffer, Feeling the 'Big Love'|date=August 1, 2007|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series has been the subject of articles in academic journals, including the ''[[Columbia Law Review]],'' ''[[Law and Contemporary Problems]],'' and ''Michigan Journal of Gender &amp; Law.''&lt;ref name=hanna/&gt; Several publications listed the series's first three seasons as among the best television of the decade 2000-09, and its final season ranked among the best-reviewed scripted series of 2011.&lt;ref name=meta/&gt;

==Development==
===Concept and writing===
''Big Love'' was created by [[Mark V. Olsen]] and [[Will Scheffer]], who also served as executive producers. Olsen and Scheffer spent nearly three years researching the premise of the show, with the intent of creating a "fair, non-judgmental portrayal of polygamy in America."&lt;ref name=nyt2006/&gt; Olsen said that the family dynamics were key to the series' narrative, mixing family affection with tensions. "It's that combustion, negotiating that mix of feelings that I think keeps an audience coming back for more."&lt;ref name=talksup&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title='Big Love' cast talks it up|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-big-love1-2009mar01-story.html|date=March 1, 2009|author=Aurthur, Kate|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictional fundamentalist group the United Effort Brotherhood (UEB) has characteristics similar to the historic United Effort Plan established by the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (FLDS) and taken over by the state of Utah in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705317558/Judge-rules-for-court-supervision-in-UEP-case.html |title=Judge rules for court supervision in UEP case |publisher=Deseret News |date=July 18, 2009 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FLDS is one of the most prolific and well-known polygamist groups and identifies itself as the legitimate successor of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], which officially discontinued polygamy in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/chchrono/contents |title=Chronology of Church History |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100428215404/http://scriptures.lds.org/chchrono/contents| archivedate= April 28, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/od/1 |title=Official Declaration 1 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |date= |accessdate=April 27, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100428230229/http://scriptures.lds.org/en/od/1| archivedate=   April 28, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creators Olsen and Scheffer included a drive through the twin FLDS towns of [[Hildale, Utah]] and [[Colorado City, Arizona]] as part of their research for the show.&lt;ref name="realsources"&gt;{{cite news

The UEB has built its own temple on its Kansas compound. The raid on Juniper Creek is reminiscent of the [[Short Creek raid]] in 1953 when Arizona state police and National Guard troops took action against polygamists in Colorado City. Many of the businesses owned by the UEB are similar to businesses owned by the [[Kingston Clan]], another Mormon fundamentalist church. The concept for the cable show was influenced by a 2003 article published in Utah on the Darger family who are Independent Fundamentalist Mormons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Joe|last1 = Darger|first2 = Alina|last2 = Darger|first3 = Vicki|last3 = Darger|first4 = Valerie|last4 = Darger|first5 = Brooke|last5 = Adams |title = Love Times Three: Our True Story of a Polygamous Marriage|publisher = [[Harper Collins]]|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-06-207407-2|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QIJysmXOPg4C&amp;pg=PT8&amp;lpg=PT8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming and sets===
Although set in Utah, the series was primarily filmed at the Santa Clarita Studios in [[Valencia, California|Valencia]], [[California]]. The location used for filming "Henrickson's Home Plus" scenes was The All American Home Center in [[Downey, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/all-american-home-center-going-out-of-business-sale-starts-thursday-november-3rd-133110533.html|work=Newswire|title=All American Home Center Going-Out-Of-Business Sale Starts Thursday, November 3rd|date=November 2, 2011|accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior scenes of the three homes that Bill owns were filmed on location on Shady Lane, in the small town of [[Fillmore, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.vcstar.com/news/sundays-finale-could-determine-if-hbos-big-love-returns-to-fillmore-ep-369539409-350026951.html/|work=Ventura County Star|title=Sunday's finale could determine if HBO's "Big Love" returns to Fillmore|author=Barlow, Zeke|date=March 5, 2010|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mall scenes from season one were filmed in the Fox Hills Mall, in Culver City, California. Other exterior shots were filmed in Downtown [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] and [[Sandy, Utah]], as well as northeast [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://atwater-village.blogspot.com/2007/06/san-fernando-road-as-seen-on-tv.html San Fernando Road: As Seen on TV], Atwater Village Newbie, June 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The [[theme song]] for the final two seasons of the series was "Home", by the band [[Engineers (band)|Engineers]]. During the first three seasons, "[[God Only Knows]]", by [[The Beach Boys]], played during the opening titles. The musical score for the series was composed by [[Anton Sanko]].

{{:List of Big Love episodes}}

===Season 1===
In [[Sandy, Utah]], [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormon]] [[Bill Henrickson]] practices a [[polygamy|polygamous]] marriage with his three wives: [[Barbara Henrickson|Barbara]] "Barb", [[Nicolette Grant|Nicolette]] "Nicki", and [[Margene Heffman|Margene]] "Margie." Bill owns and operates Home Plus, a local hardware store chain which earns the family considerable income, and allows him to support his wives and their seven children. Tensions rise within the family amidst the wives with the newly-introduced Margie, a former babysitter of Bill's and employee at his store—as well as between Bill and [[Roman Grant]], Nicolette's father, who is an influential patriarch and [[prophet]] of Juniper Creek, the fundamentalist compound where Nicolette and Bill were raised. Meanwhile, Bill and Barb's eldest children, [[Ben Henrickson|Ben]] and [[Sarah Henrickson|Sarah]], individually deal with maintaining a façade to conceal their parents' polygamous marriage from their peers and community.

Barb seeks independence by taking a job as a schoolteacher, while Nicki, a [[Compulsive buying disorder|compulsive shopper]], incurs nearly $60,000 in [[credit card]] debt, and Margie struggles to find footing in the family. Bill and his associate Don Embry, also a polygamist, continue to dispute with Roman over business holdings in Home Plus. Roman is aided by his [[psychopathy|sociopath]]ic teenage bride [[Rhonda Volmer]], as well as his son (and Nicolette's elder brother) [[Alby Grant|Alby]], a [[closeted]] homosexual and ardent follower of the United Effort Brotherhood (UEB), the priesthood of Juniper Creek. Bill, who was shunned from Juniper Creek as a teenager, is devastated when he discovers that his shunning was not caused by his parents, Frank and Lois, but by Roman, who feared Bill would usurp the prophecy.

After deciding to follow through with her baptism, Margie discovers she is pregnant. Shortly after, Barb is awarded the title of "Mother of the Year" by the local government after daughter Teeny nominates her. Flattered, Barb goes to attend the award ceremony at the governor's mansion, but is disqualified before the crowd when the judges are informed that she is a polygamist.

===Season 2===
After the family's exposure, Barb goes into seclusion, and Margie suspects their neighbors, Pam and Carl, were responsible. Home Plus billboards are vandalized, and the tumult within the house results in Bill and Barb forgetting Nicki's anniversary, exacerbating tensions. Barb decides to begin taking classes at the [[University of Utah]] to earn a [[Master's degree]]. At Juniper Creek, Bill's sister-in-law, Wanda, is tried by the community for attempting to poison Alby to death; Bill's brother Joey, a former [[National Football League|NFL]] player, turns himself into police to prevent Wanda from facing prison.

Sarah joins an ex-Mormon support group to voice her frustrations over her family life, and meets Scott, a twenty-something-year-old whom she begins dating. Rhonda escapes Juniper Creek and manipulates her way into staying with Sarah's friend and co-worker, Heather; she then begins manipulating and blackmailing Heather and her family in order to help forge a career as a singer. Wanda is released from a psychiatric institute after Alby's poisoning, and Lois attempts to persuade Joey to take a second wife, Kathy. Meanwhile, Nicki enrolls son Wayne in a [[Catholic church|Catholic]] school, and grows paranoid that he will be indoctrinated, while Bill develops an attraction to Ana, a Serbian immigrant who works at a local diner; Margie uncovers this and forges a friendship with Ana unbeknownst to Bill. At home, teenaged Ben confesses to Bill and Barb that he is having sex with his irreligious girlfriend, Bryn, and expresses interest in practicing polygamy himself.

Meanwhile, Bill begins a business venture with Weber Gaming, a casino that operates on virtual currency, and is caught in the crossfires of a dispute between the Grant family and the Greenes, an underground polygamist family. Roman is ambushed by the Greenes and critically injured, leaving him hospitalized at the compound; Alby assumes the role of the compound leader and, with the help of wife Lura, extends Roman's convalescence by keeping him sedated. Joey begins to court Kathy, and Nicki holds a party for him, Kathy, and Wanda at their home. Meanwhile, Barb reunites with her estranged mother Nancy, and sister Cindy, on the occasion of Nancy's remarriage. Adaleen realizes Alby has been sedating Roman, and brings Roman to Bill's home seeking safety. Barb and Margie confess to neighbor Pam that they are polygamists.

===Season 3===
After Margie gives birth to Nell, Bill begins dating Ana formally. Roman is indicted on charges of [[rape]] and child sex abuse based on claims made by Alby, who is seeking to take his place. Posing as Margie, Nicki takes a job at the district attorney's office to help pay off her credit card debts, meanwhile seeking the state's evidence against her father. While [[cruising for sex]] at a rest stop, Alby is attacked by a stranger, and suspects Bill has put a [[contract killing|hit]] on him, but it is revealed to be Adaleen, attempting to dissuade him of his same-sex attractions. Barb becomes concerned that her [[cervical cancer]], treated with a [[hysterectomy]] years prior, may have recurred, but test results determine she is still in remission. Bill takes in his younger half-brother, Frankie, who has been kicked out of Juniper Creek, and it is revealed that Nicki has been on [[birth control]] for several years; meanwhile, Sarah discovers she is pregnant with Scott's child. Margie's alcoholic mother, Ginger, dies in an accident. Meanwhile, Bill pursues a business venture with Jerry Flute, a member of the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot tribe]], on a casino.

Adaleen bribes Rhonda with $30,000 if she refuses to testify against Roman, and Rhonda takes the money and flees to [[Los Angeles]]. Roman is acquitted of the charges. Bill marries Ana, but it is short-lived, as she divorces the family within a matter of days. The family make a cross-country pilgrimage to [[Cumorah|Cumorah, New York]], visiting historical sites associated with Mormon pioneers en route. During the trip, Ginger's ashes are lost, and Barb finds Nicki's birth control pills, which she assumes are Sarah's. Nicki confesses they are hers. That night, Sarah suffers a [[miscarriage]].

Nicki is persuaded to keep her job at the D.A.'s office by Ray, her boss who has a crush on her, but quits when Margie discovers she's using her identity. Sarah and Heather make plans to enroll at [[Arizona State University]], but Sarah eventually backs out. Roman attempts to marry Kathy to Hollis Greene as punishment for her testifying against him. Roman chases her when she flees, and she dies in a car accident while trying to escape. After her death, Bill attempts to get the D.A. to charge Roman with murder. Bill seeks a document legitimizing polygamy in the LDS church from Cindy and Ted. In an investigation into the letter, Barb becomes formally excommunicated from the LDS church.

Lois and Frank attempt to rekindle their tumultuous marriage after Lois's extensive attempts to murder him. Nicki develops romantic feelings for Ray, but he inadvertently discovers she is Roman's daughter, and is married to Bill. Enraged over her dishonesty, Ray threatens to charge Nicki with [[obstruction of justice]], and she goes to stay at the compound. She returns home to mend her marriage with Bill.

===Season 4===
Roman disappears, and the D.A. attempts to dismantle Juniper Creek. Fearing a [[witch-hunt]], Bill decides to run for office against a stark anti-polygamy candidate as an open polygamist. Nicki takes in Cara Lynn, her daughter from a previous arranged marriage on the compound who has been raised by her father, J.J. (brother of Wanda) in Kansas. Alby begins a romantic relationship with Dale, a married attorney negotiating with Juniper Creek on behalf of the state. Sarah is married to Scott by Bill, and reunites with Heather. Adaleen invites Nicki to the compound where she reveals Roman's corpse, which she's been keeping in a meat freezer; Nicki urges her to inform the authorities. Joey and Nicki believe Bill is to be the next prophet of the compound.

Margie begins a jewelry business sold via [[Shopping channel|televised shopping]]. On the compound, Lois, Ben, and Kathy's sister JoDean begin an illicit business selling exotic birds smuggled from Mexico. Bill, Nicki, and Cara Lynn travel to [[Washington, D.C.]] where Bill attempts to get a land endorsement; there, he is met with the ire of Marilyn Densham, a venal [[lobbying|lobbyist]]. Meanwhile, Barb takes over duties at the casino. Marilyn comes to Salt Lake City during the primaries and tries to forge a working relationship with Bill based on his business ventures, and both Margie and Ben are ostracized when it is revealed they have romantic feelings toward on another; Ben flees to the compound and joins Lois, Frank, and JoDean. Frank crashes a political party at Bill's casino, and Bill receives news he has won the nomination.

Bill and the wives find Ana working at an upscale restaurant and discover she is pregnant with Bill's child. Alby's feelings for Dale deepen and he rents an apartment for them to meet in; Lura discovers their affair and informs Dale's wife, leading Dale to commit suicide in the apartment. The Greenes kidnap Lois, Frank, and Ben in Mexico. Meanwhile, Sarah moves with Scott to [[Portland, Oregon]], against Nicki and Barb's wishes. Bill arrives in Mexico to save Lois, Frank, and Ben from execution; Lois attacks Hollis with a machete, cutting off his arm. They drive him to a hospital to save him under the condition that Ben, Frank, and Lois are freed. Bill returns home safely with Ben. Barb discovers that Marilyn is in cahoots with the casino's opposition, leading Bill to confront and fire her. Nicki discovers she is infertile, and Margie marries Goran, Ana's new boyfriend, to prevent him from being deported.

On election day, Bill and Barb dispute over Bill's handling of a drug deal within the casino, and Marilyn discovers Bill is a polygamist. J.J. has a doctor lure Nicki to the compound, claiming she is pregnant. Wanda informs Bill that J.J. has impregnated Adaleen with her and J.J.'s child, and that Nicki is being tricked into having Cara Lynn's egg implanted into her. Adaleen breaks free and interrupts the procedure, and Nicki stabs J.J. with surgical scissors. That evening, Adaleen burns down the compound clinic with J.J. and his wife inside, killing them. Bill wins the election, and announces during a press interview that he is a polygamist, inviting each of the wives onstage.

===Season 5===
After his election, Bill establishes his own church at Juniper Creek, and seeks to reform the compound and dismantle the UEB against Alby's wishes. Meanwhile, he faces the ire of local government and the public. An open house invitation hosted by Bill and the wives is coldly received, though a group of fellow polygamists arrive at the end of the night. Barb and mother Nancy join a group focusing on Mormon mother-daughter relationships, and Barb comes to believe she possesses the priesthood, which Bill and Nicki vehemently challenge; Barb begins drinking alcohol, which also stuns the family. On [[Christmas Eve]], Margie reveals that she was in fact sixteen when she married Bill, and had concealed her true age. Heather, who attended the holiday dinner with Ben, inadvertently tells her police officer father of Margie's revelation, which in turn launches an investigation against Bill for [[statutory rape]]. Lois is diagnosed with [[vascular dementia]] and Bill moves her into their home.

Nicki struggles to tell Cara Lynn that her father is dead, and Adaleen reveals she has been impregnatated with Cara Lynn and J.J.'s incestuous child. Alby begins a mission to "purify" the compound, leading his wife, Lura, to leave him. Meanwhile, Cara Lynn begins an illicit relationship with her math teacher, Greg, which Margie and Nicki uncover. Rhonda returns to Sandy with her new husband, Verlan, and their infant child. The two attempt to extort money from Alby for the past abuses Rhonda suffered at the hands of Roman, and Verlan begins offering sexual favors to Alby in exchange for money. In an effort to legally adopt Cara Lynn, Nicki requests that Barb formally divorce Bill in order for her and Bill to legally adopt her. Barb reluctantly agrees. Pam confides in Margie that she and Carl may be divorcing.

While ice fishing with his sons, Don is attacked by a masked stranger and nearly dies; it is later revealed to be Verlan, working on behalf of Alby. Nicki decides to devote her time rescuing women from the compound. During a confrontation, Alby kidnaps Nicki and brings her to a secluded location to murder her. Nicki begs for her life, and he instead shoots Verlan to death, sparing Nicki. The wives prepare for the possibility that Bill may be indicted, and Bill is infuriated when he discovers Barb has been attending a reform-LDS church.

Alby attempts to assassinate Bill at the state capitol, but his attempt is thwarted and Alby is imprisoned. As Bill's potential trial looms, Barb decides to join the reform-LDS church, and Margie considers making a [[Christian mission|mission]] to South America, leaving Nicki fearful she will be left alone. Meanwhile, Lois's dementia worsens significantly, and she is placed in an assisted living home. Bill proposes the legalization of polygamy in an effort to prevent the covert abuses that have occurred in compounds like Juniper Creek. Bill and Don lose ownership of Home Plus amidst the scandal. Barb is ultimately unable to follow through with her baptism, and instead joins the family at Juniper Creek where Bill gives an emotional Easter sermon.

While the Henricksons prepare for Easter dinner, Frank helps Lois commit [[assisted suicide]], recounting their life together while she dies in his arms. In his driveway, Bill is confronted by a mentally-ill Carl, who is infuriated over Bill's kind gesture of re-sodding his and Pam's front lawn. Carl shoots Bill in the chest. Barb, Nicki, and Margie rush to his aid, and perform a blessing over him as he bleeds to death on the ground.

Eleven months later, a memorial is held in Bill's honor, and Sarah returns home with Scott and her newborn son, who they've named after Bill. As Sarah and Scott prepare to fly back to Oregon, Margie also prepares to leave on her mission to South America. The wives emotionally embrace as Bill watches from the dining table.

==Reception==
===Critical opinion===
Review aggregate [[Metacritic]] indicated positive critical response for all five seasons.  The average scores for the first through fourth seasons were 72/100, 71/100, 79/100, and 70/100, indicating "generally favorable reviews."  The fifth and final season received an average score of 85/100, or "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/tv/shows/biglove Big Love (HBO) - Reviews from Metacritic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; Based on its overall Metaritic score of 75, ''[[Business Insider]]'' ranked the series at number 29 in its 2017 list of every HBO series ranked "from best to worst."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/hbo-shows-ranked-critics-2017-2/#29-big-love-2006-11-five-seasons-43|work=[[Business Insider]]|title=Every HBO show ranked from worst to best, according to critics|accessdate=December 23, 2017|date=March 9, 2017|author=Wittmer, Carrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its debut, reaction to the series was mixed-to-positive. Initial raves came from publications such as ''[[Time Magazine]],'' ''[[The Wall Street Journal]],'' and ''[[New York Daily News]]'' -- [[James Poniewozik]] described it as a "first-rate drama"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1169923,00.html | work=Time | first=James | last=Poniewozik | title=Television: Take My Wives, Please | date=March 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dorothy Rabinowitz]] said it was "seriously compelling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114194619457994142?mod=2_1168_1 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Dorothy | last=Rabinowitz | title=High Note | date=March 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publications such as ''[[Entertainment Weekly]],'' ''[[The New Yorker]],'' ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]],'' the ''[[Boston Globe]],'' and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' were all positive as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/big-love/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Big Love Season 1 |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable detractors included Robert Lloyd of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' who said it ultimately "didn't convince";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/tv/reviews/cl-et-biglove10mar10,0,3660789.story?coll=cl-tvent-util|title=Page Not Found - Los Angeles Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doug Elfman of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]],'' who felt its quality didn't match its concept;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/elfman/cst-ftr-elf09.html | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Chicago - Chicago : News : Politics : Things To Do : Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John Leonard of ''[[New York Magazine]],'' describing it as "more soapy than salacious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/reviews/16328/ |title=Polygamy for Dummies |first=John |last=Leonard |journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=January 29, 2015 |date=March 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second season, critical reception warmed. Maureen Ryan of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' and noted critic [[Alan Sepinwall]] remained ambivalent towards the show; otherwise critics were uniformly positive. In particular, several critics noted improvements from season one. Gillian Flynn of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote, "''Big Love'' has dropped the last vestiges of its ostentatious quirkiness and fashioned itself into a rich and grounded family drama," and Diane Werts of ''[[Newsday]]'' said that "'Big Love' does more this year than you might expect, and more richly, more provocatively, more dramatically and amusingly, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/big-love/season-2/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Big Love Season 2 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second season was cited among the best shows of 2007 by numerous publications, including ''[[PopMatters]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/high-redefinition-the-30-best-tv-shows-of-2007/P1/ |title=High Redefinition: The 30 Best TV Shows of 2007 |date=January 17, 2008 |website=[[PopMatters]] |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/TV-s-best-and-worst-of-2007-3233740.php#page-2 |title=TV's best and worst of 2007 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |first=Tim |last=Goodman |date=December 31, 2007 |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686244_1691404,00.html Poniewozik, James;  Top 10 New TV Series; time.com].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20166802_20384066,00.html#20384057 |title=The 10 Best TV Shows of 2007 |date=December 21, 2007 |first=Gillian |last=Flynn |accessdate=January 29, 2015 |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17576952 |title=The Best Television Programs of 2007 |date=December 24, 2007 |website=[[NPR]] |accessdate=January 29, 2015 |first=David |last=Bianculli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season three vaulted ''Big Love'' to universal critical acclaim. Notably, Tim Stack of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the season's early episodes an 'A' grade, and Mary McNamara of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said, "If there's a better written, better acted, more originally conceived show on television, I defy you to name it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/big-love/season-3/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Big Love Season 3 |accessdate=January 29, 2015 |website=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years of popping up spottily on critics' 'Best Of' lists, season three was recognized as one of the top seasons of television from 2009. In aggregating Top 10 lists from every major television critic, [[Metacritic]] reported that 10 critics had cited the series, tying for the eighth-most mentions (and, in particular, ''Big Love'' ranked third on that list among series in their third season or later).&lt;ref name=meta&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/best-tv-of-2009-and-the-decade?page=1 |title=The Best TV Shows of 2009 ... and the Decade |first=Jason |last=Dietz |date=January 2, 2010 |accessdate=January 29, 2015 |website=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though only its first three seasons aired in the 2000s (decade), multiple critics cited ''Big Love'' as one of the best series of the decade. They include the ''[[Huffington Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2009/12/07/best-tv-shows-of-the-2000s/ |title=Best TV Shows of the 2000s |date=December 7, 2009 |first=Kim |last=Potts |website=[[AOL TV]] |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/43513 |title=Herc Picks The Best TV Of 2009 and The Decade!! |date=January 4, 2010 |website=[[Ain't It Cool News]] |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', who wrote "''Big Love'' has proved to be one of the most ... earnest studies of religion and morality ever to air on television."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/the-best-tv-series-of-the-00s-35256 |title=The best TV series of the ’00s |website=[[The A.V.

Returning in 2010, ''Big Love'' was met with mixed critical response for a shorter fourth season. General consensus dictated that the series was focused too much on plot, with character development suffering as a result. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' identified a lack of energy in the actors, looking "alternately confused and pooped, empty shells of the characters they used to play".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/07/AR2010010704553.html |title=Hank Stuever previews 'Big Love': Season 4 is a tangle of story lines |date=January 10, 2010 |first=Hank |last=Stuever |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putting it into perspective, Rob Owen of the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' wrote, "In this new season the show is spinning off into too many directions. None, taken individually, is terrible, but altogether these myriad plots create a lack of focus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.post-gazette.com/blogs/tunedin/archive/2010/01/07/big-love-big-disappointment.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111005638/http://community.post-gazette.com/blogs/tunedin/archive/2010/01/07/big-love-big-disappointment.aspx |archivedate=2010-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]],'' which a year earlier had cited the drama as one of the previous decade's top 20 shows, described the fourth season after its finale as "The season that virtually obliterated ''Big Love'''s dramatic credibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/big-love-end-of-days-38916 |title=''Big Love'': "End Of Days" |first=Amelie |last=Gillette |website=[[The A.V. Club]] |date=March 7, 2010 |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the series returned for its fifth and final season the next year, critical reaction was extremely enthusiastic. ''Big Love'' received the best early reviews of its entire run. Mary McNamara wrote, "''Big Love'' quickly reclaims its astonishing ability to balance the insightful and the absurd, hilarity and heartbreak and the personal with the political."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/15/entertainment/la-et-big-love-review-20110115 |title=Television review: 'Big Love' Season 5 |date=January 15, 2011 |first=Mary |last=McNamara |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar raves came from Nancy DeWolf Smith of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]],'' who said the final season was "mesmerizing", and the ''[[New York Post]],'' which awarded the final season a perfect four out of four stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/big-love/season-5/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Big Love Season 5 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the final season of ''Big Love'' tied as the fourth-best reviewed returning show of 2011, trailing only ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]'' and the animated comedy ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]''. It was the tenth-best reviewed scripted series of the year overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/browse/tv/score/metascore/year?sort=desc&amp;view=condensed&amp;year_selected=2011 |title=Best TV Shows for 2011 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Response to the series finale, "When Men and Mountains Meet," was passionate among top publications. Jace Lacob of the ''[[Daily Beast]]'' called it the "perfect way to close out this series" and described his reaction to it as "emotional".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionaryblog.com/2011/03/eternity-thoughts-on-series-finale-of.html|title=Eternity: Thoughts on the Series Finale of HBO's ''Big Love''|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Poniewozik]] wrote for ''[[Time Magazine]]'' that "In the end ... ''Big Love'' came back full circle to the core relationships ... We closed on a moving if messy note for a moving if messy series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/03/21/big-love-watch-god-only-knows-what-wed-be-without-you/ |title=Big Love Watch: God Only Knows What We'd Be Without You |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 21, 2011 |first=James |last=Poniewozik |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary McNamara, of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' dubbed it "a perfect finish to an astonishingly ambitious show that often careened through genre, narrative structure and believability like they were false walls on a stage". In her rumination on the finale, Ginia Bellafante of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that "[''Big Love''] was always at its most compelling as an indictment of the mindless spiritual avidity and the bizarre displays of self-exoneration that can go on in the name of faith," and celebrated the finale for committing to that theme. She also wrote that the series had "achieved the resonance of [HBO's] other heralded series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/arts/television/in-big-love-finale-on-hbo-a-comeuppance-for-the-man.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ginia | last=Bellafante | title=In 'Big Love' Finale on HBO, a Comeuppance for the Man | date=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for [[TV Squad]], Dr. Ryan Vaughn was less enthusiastic about the finale but said, "I'm not going to let a great series be sullied with a mediocre finale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/tv|title=TV|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[The A.V. Club]] awarded the series finale, and the series as a whole, a B+, writing that its first three seasons in particular qualified as "remarkable television."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/big-love-when-men-and-mountains-meet-53378 |title=''Big Love'': "When Men And Mountains Meet" |first=Todd |last=VanDerWerff |website=The A.V. Club |date=March 21, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LDS Church and others===
In March 2006, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), which ended practice of polygamy in 1890 and often distances itself from modern polygamist breakoffs, issued a public statement citing concerns over the program's depiction of abuse, polygamy, use of stereotypes, and television's depiction of moral and civic values in general.&lt;ref name="newsroom.lds.org"&gt;[http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/commentary/church-responds-to-questions-on-hbo-s-big-love "Church Responds to Questions on HBO's Big Love"], press release, lds.org, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2006-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the church stated, "Despite its popularity with some, much of today's television entertainment shows an unhealthy preoccupation with sex, coarse humor and foul language. ''Big Love'', like so much other television programming, is essentially lazy and indulgent entertainment that does nothing for our society and will never nourish great minds."&lt;ref name="newsroom.lds.org"/&gt; In March 2009, the LDS Church stated that HBO's writers, producers, and executives were displaying insensitivity to church members by choosing to display simulated segments of the LDS Church's [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment]] ceremony in an episode of ''Big Love''.&lt;ref name = dobner&gt;Jennifer Dobner, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/10/hbo-vs-the-mormons-in-bat_n_173707.html "HBO Vs. The Mormons In Battle Over Temple Ceremony"], ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 2009-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vince&gt;Vince Horiuchi, [http://www.sltrib.com/ci_11874222 "LDS Temple secrets? 'Big Love' TV episode angers Mormons: TV show to air Sunday reportedly depicts faith's endowment ceremony"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313043943/http://www.sltrib.com/ci_11874222 |date=2009-03-13 }}, ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'', 2009-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,705289746,00.html "LDS Church comments on 'Big Love'"], ''[[Deseret News]]'', March 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church also stated that the show had continued to blur the distinction between the LDS Church and "the show's fictional non-Mormon characters".&lt;ref name = dobner/&gt;

In contrast to the statement made by the LDS church, several real fundamentalist Mormon polygamists spoke in favor of the series: In a 2006 interview in ''[[The New York Times]]'' with various polygamist wives, one noted: "It's a more realistic view of a polygamous family that lives out in society than people have known. It can be seen as a viable alternative lifestyle between consenting adults."&lt;ref name=nyt2006&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/28/arts/television/28poly.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=BF2D19B9D70E93E4B89F88268D0D6008&amp;gwt=pay|work=[[The New York Times]]|title='Big Love': Real Polygamists Look at HBO Polygamists and Find Sex|date=March 28, 2006|accessdate=January 22, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219000645/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/28/arts/television/28poly.html|archivedate=December 19, 2011|author=Lee, Felicia R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series did garner criticism from some members of the LDS church during its third season for an episode's depiction of an [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]] ceremony, a sacred ritual in the church.&lt;ref name=apology&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mormons/big-love-network-apologizes-to-mormons-idUSTRE5297AK20090311|work=Reuters|author=Serjeant, Jill|accessdate=December 19, 2017|date=March 11, 2009|title="Big Love" network apologizes to Mormons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the LDS church did not issue a statement, HBO made a public apology over the depiction.&lt;ref name=apology/&gt;

===Academic assessment===
Since its premiere, ''Big Love'' has been the subject of several studies in the humanities and social sciences.

Dr. Cheryl Hanna explored "the problem of categorical exclusions to the consent doctrine in private intimate relationships" through the lens of ''Big Love'', specifically citing its "beautifully explored" tensions between individual autonomy and state interests. In her conclusion, she wrote "the future of feminist legal theory depends on its ability to remain ambivalent about the tensions presented in the consent doctrine as applied to contexts such as polygamy, prostitution, sadomasochistic sex, obscenity, and domestic violence. ''Big Love'' seeks to persuade us to accept ambivalence and to be open to changing our minds because of the complicated nature of women's (and men's) lives; feminist legal theory ought to persuade us to do the same."&lt;ref name=hanna&gt;Hanna, Cheryl. "Rethinking Consent in a Big Love Way." Michigan Journal of Gender &amp; Law 17:1 (2010, pg. 111-156)&lt;/ref&gt;

For the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', Dr. Adrienne D. Davis assessed legal debates surrounding polygamy after the premiere of ''Big Love'' and how it was being likened to same-sex marriage. She wrote, "The highly acclaimed hit series self-consciously invites viewers to consider analogies between same-sex and polygamous families. In the show's much-anticipated second season, the invitation became more pointed and persistent, with intermittent references to 'coming out,' 'closeted families,' and 'the state' as repressively surveilling nonconforming 'big love.'" However, she claimed that Hollywood and television critics' desire to interpret the polygamy in ''Big Love'' and beyond as representative of American "quirky families" was a miscue. Ultimately, she argues that the dichotomy presented by ''Big Love'' works when viewed in terms of "intimacy liberty, privacy, autonomy, and agency, or even an incipient constitutional respect for 'sexual minorities.'"; the very essence, as Davis notes and commends, of the series' themes.&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne D. Davis, "Regulating Polygamy: Intimacy, Default Rules, and Bargaining for Equality." Columbia Law Review 110:8 (2010, pg. 1955-2046)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Brenda Cossman examined ''Big Love'' closely in her study of "migrating marriages" for ''[[Law and Contemporary Problems]]''. In addition to asserting that "Just as in ''Big Love'', same-sex marriage is never more than one degree away of separation from polygamy," she found that the series adds crucial insight to the understanding of marriages that exist between legal and cultural recognition. As she explains, "These cases can be seen through the lens of ... ''Big Love'', in which marriages are produced as the culturally real in the here and the now, even when legal recognition remains elusive." By exploring the movement seeking to culturally legitimize same-sex marriage, she concluded ''Big Love'' served as a most powerful, unique allegory: "''Big Love'' plays on an even more decisive gap: polygamous marriages are not legal in Utah or anywhere else in the country. Yet the point and the poignancy of the show is to depict a 'real-life' family. Bill Hendrickson and his three wives struggle with all of the daily trials of contemporary family life: parenting, finances, intimacy, and sex. The sympathetic portrayal of their family is as culturally real, although it suffers by virtue of its nonlegal recognition."&lt;ref&gt;Cossman, Brenda. "Betwixt and Between Recognition: Migrating Same-Sex Marriages and the Turn Toward the Private." Law and Contemporary Problems 71:3 (2008, pg. 153-168)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Big Love'' was also studied as a part of Andrew Atkinson's study of HBO programs and the post-secular humanistic themes they elicit. In writing of ''Big Love'', Atkinson too draws on the parallel between gay rights and polygamist rights illuminated by the series, but focuses more on the series' influential humanistic elements. In fact, he somewhat rebuffs earlier assertions made: "The attention that is paid to the minute details of Mormon ritual, theology, and historical disputes demonstrates that HBO's writers are uncomfortable with the supposed dichotomy that constructs homosexuality as by default areligious." Atkinson focuses on the ending, interpreting Barb's blessing of Bill as a "ritual innovation [that] indicates that FLDS Mormonism must shed the trappings of patriarchy if it wants to legitimate polygamy in a post-feminist society", and the fall of Alby, the closet homosexual, as a powerful interpretation of "the future theo-political and sexual tensions that Mormonism, and by extension, the broader American polity, will face as the post-secular matures". In concluding, Atkinson makes the case that ''Big Love'' and other HBO shows like ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[The Wire]]'' and ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' "contribute to a fuller conception of humanity" than other forms of art and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, Andrew.

[[File:Russian bread and salt.jpg|thumb|Bread and salt, a traditional greeting in some Slavic countries.]]
'''Bread and salt''' is a welcome [[greeting]] ceremony in several [[Slavs|Slavic]] and other European cultures and in Middle Eastern cultures. The tradition, known by local [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] names: [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: ''Хлеб і соль''; {{lang-bg|Хляб и сол}}; {{lang-mk|Леб и сол}}; {{lang-hr|Kruh i sol}}; {{lang-sr|Хлеб и со}} / ''Hleb i so''; {{lang-pl| Chleb i Sól}}; {{lang-sk|Chlieb a soľ}}; {{lang-cz|Chléb a sůl}}; {{lang-sl|Kruh in sol}}; {{lang-ru|Хлеб-соль}}, {{lang-ua|Хліб і сіль}} was also adopted by three non-Slavic nations — [[Lithuanians]], [[Latvians]] (both Baltic) and [[Romanians]] (Latin) — all three of which are culturally and historically close to their Slavic neighbours ({{lang-lt|Duona ir druska}}. {{lang-lv|Sālsmaize}} and {{lang-ro|Pâine și sare}}). It is also common in Albania ({{lang-sq|bukë, kripë e zemër}}), Armenia ({{lang-hy|աղ ու հաց}}, ''agh u hats''), the [[Jewish diaspora]], and the [[Middle East]]. This tradition has also been observed in [[human spaceflight|spaceflight]].&lt;ref name=TDC&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunn|first1=Marcia|title=The Daily Courier (Yavapai, AZ)|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=894&amp;dat=19950317&amp;id=gyYOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mn0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6611,2108414|work=news.google.com|date=March 17, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kosmonavtika&gt;{{cite web|last1=McHale|first1=Suzy|title=Ceremonies {{!}} RuSpace|url=http://suzymchale.com/ruspace/ceremonies.html|website=suzymchale.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural associations==

[[File:Buka_e_misrit_dhe_buka_pogaçe.jpg|thumb]]
===Albania===
Bread, salt and heart ({{lang-sq|bukë, kripë e zemër}}) is a traditional Albanian way of honoring guests, it dates back from the [[Kanun_(Albania)|Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini]] Chapter 18 - para.608: "The Guest shall be welcomed with Bread, salt and heart". Heart in the context is related with hospitality, the concept is based on giving the most expensive thing of that time which was salt to the awaited guest. Nowadays it is not commonly practiced during daily life.

===Belarus, Russia and Ukraine===
[[File:US Navy 060703-N-2468S-001 Vice Adm. Jonathan Greenert, commander, U.S. Seventh Fleet, takes part in a cultural exchange ceremony during a routine port visit to Vladivostok, Russia.jpg|thumb|left|[[United States Navy|US Naval officer]] takes part in a bread and salt ceremony after arriving in [[Vladivostok]], Russia, July 3, 2006.]]
When important, respected, or admired guests arrive, they are presented with a [[loaf]] of [[bread]] (usually a [[korovai]]) placed on a ''[[rushnyk]]'' ([[embroidery|embroidered ritual cloth]]). A salt holder or a [[salt cellar]] is placed on top of the bread loaf or secured in a hole on the top of the loaf. On official occasions, the "bread and salt" is usually presented by young women dressed in national costumes (e.g., [[sarafan]] and [[kokoshnik]]).

The tradition gave rise to the Russian word that expresses a person's hospitality: ''"khlebosolny"'' (literally: "bready-salty"). In general, the word "bread" is associated in [[Russian culture]] with hospitality, bread being the most respected food, whereas salt is associated with long friendship, as expressed in a Russian [[saying]] "to eat a [[pood]] of salt (together with someone)". Also historically the [[Russian Empire]] had a high [[salt tax]] that made salt a very expensive and prized commodity (see also the [[Moscow uprising of 1648]]).

[[File:Biden Kyiv Bread.jpg|thumb|[[Vice President of the United States|American Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]] dips a piece of bread in salt as part of a welcoming ceremony upon his arrival in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]], July 20, 2009.]]
There also is a traditional Russian greeting "Khleb da sol!" (''Хлеб да соль!'' "Bread and salt!"). The phrase is to be uttered by an arriving guest as an expression of good wish towards the host's household. It was often used by beggars as an implicit hint to be fed, therefore a mocking rhymed response is known:  "Khleb da sol!" &amp;mdash; "Yem da svoy!" (''Хлеб да соль'' &amp;mdash; ''ем да свой!'' "Bread and salt!" &amp;mdash; "I am eating and it is my own!").

[[File:Southgate bread and salt.jpg|thumb|[[Gareth Southgate]] and [[Harry Kane]] taking part in a bread and salt ceremony after arriving in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, 13 June 2018]]
In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], it is customary to greet the [[bishop]] at the steps of the church when he arrives for a pastoral visit to a church or [[monastery]] with bread and salt.

===Bulgaria===
Bread and salt ({{lang-bg|хляб и сол}}, transliterated ''hlyab i sol'') is a traditional Bulgarian custom expressing hospitality, showing that the guest is welcomed. The bread and salt is commonly presented to guests by a woman.  Bulgarians usually make a certain type of bread for this occasion called ''[[Pogača|pogacha]]'', which is flat, fancy, and decorated. Regular bread is not usually used, although it may have been historically, but ''pogacha'' is much more common in this custom.

Usually, guests are presented with the ''pogacha'', and the guest is supposed to take a small piece, dip into the salt and eat it. This custom is common for official visits regardless of whether the guest is foreign or Bulgarian. One notable example of this custom is when the Russians came to liberate Bulgaria from the Ottomans at the end of the 19th century. A common scene from that period was of a Bulgarian village woman welcoming Russian soldiers with bread and salt as a sign of gratitude.

===Czech Republic and Slovakia===
This tradition is still practiced in the Czech Republic (''chléb a sůl'') and Slovakia (''chlieb a soľ'') for special occasions, for example, when presidents from other countries are visiting. It is not commonly practiced during daily life.

===Poland===
In Poland, welcoming with bread and salt ("''chlebem i solą''") is often associated with the traditional hospitality ("''staropolska gościnność''") of the Polish nobility (''[[szlachta]]''), who prided themselves on their hospitality. A 17th-century [[Polish poet]], [[Wespazjan Kochowski]], wrote in 1674: "O good bread, when it is given to guests with salt and good will!"&lt;!--"O dobryż chleb, gdy jest z solą dany gościom z dobrą wolą"--&gt; Another poet who mentioned the custom was [[Wacław Potocki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Wacław Potocki - 'Chlebem, czapką, solą'|url = http://www.republika.pl/o_chlebie/potocki.html|website = |accessdate = 2015-06-13|publisher = republika.pl|archivedate = March 4, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080304214957/http://www.o_chlebie.republika.pl/potocki.html|language = Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom was, however, not limited to the nobility, as Polish people of all classes observed this tradition, reflected in old Polish [[proverb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Chlebem i solą. Dawne uczty polskie' - Wydarzenie |url=http://www.culture.pl/kalendarz-pelna-tresc/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/L6vx/content/chlebem-i-sola-dawne-uczty-polskie |accessdate=2015-06-13 |publisher=culture.pl |language=Polish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517011924/http://www.culture.pl/kalendarz-pelna-tresc/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/L6vx/content/chlebem-i-sola-dawne-uczty-polskie |archivedate=2013-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the tradition is mainly observed on wedding days, when newlyweds are greeted with bread and salt by their parents on returning from the church [[wedding]].

===Republic of Macedonia===
In the [[Republic of Macedonia]], this tradition still is practiced occasionally as a custom expressing hospitality. A certain type of bread, similar to that in Bulgaria and also by the same name — ''[[pogača]]'' (from [[Latin]] ''panis focacius'') is prepared.

The famous Macedonian and ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] ethno-jazz-rock group of even more famous world music guitarist, [[Vlatko Stefanovski]], had the name "[[Leb i Sol]]", which means "bread and salt" and speaks itself about this term of hospitality as something basic and traditional.

===Romania===
As in Slavic countries, bread and salt is a traditional Romanian custom expressing hospitality, showing that the guest is welcomed.

===Serbia===
Bread and salt (''hleb i so'') is a traditional welcoming of guests,&lt;ref name="Albala2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Albala|title=Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTo6c_PJWRgC&amp;pg=RA3-PA329|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37626-9|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt; being customary to offer it before anything else,&lt;ref name="ZamurovićSlani2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dragoljub Zamurović|author2=Ilja Slani|author3=Madge Phillips-Tomašević|title=Serbia: life and customs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXAMAQAAMAAJ|year=2002|publisher=ULUPUDS|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; with bread having an important place in Serbian tradition, used in rituals.&lt;ref name="GallHobby2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Timothy L.

It is part of the state protocol, in use since the [[Principality of Serbia]], often used when welcoming foreign representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pogača i so kroz vekove čuvaju goste|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/reportaze/aktuelno.293.html:559524-Pogaca-i-so-kroz-vekove-cuvaju-goste}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania===
In Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, bread and salt were traditionally given as a symbol of blessing for a new home. Instead of white bread, dark fiber-rich rye bread was used.

===Germany===
Bread and salt are given away for different reasons:
* to the wedding for a lasting alliance between spouses
* to move into a house to wish sedentary, prosperity and fertility.

In northern Germany and Bohemia (Czech Republic) bread and salt are traditionally put into the [[diaper]] of a newborn. In Transylvania bread and salt are served to protect against weather demons.

===Arab culture===
Arab culture also have a concept of "bread and salt" (خبز وملح or عيش وملح) but not in the context of welcoming, but as an expression of alliance by eating together, symbolizing the rapprochement between two persons. Eating bread and salt with a friend is considered to create a moral obligation which requires gratitude. This attitude is also expressed by Arab phrases such as "there are bread and salt between us" (بيننا خبز وملح or بيننا عيش وملح), and "salt between them" (بينهما ملح) which are terms of alliance.

===Jewish culture===
The practice exists also among Jews in the Diaspora and in Israel. The ceremony of [[Kiddush]] includes dipping a piece of [[Challah]] in salt.  Bread and salt are also used in welcoming ceremonies and given to the welcomed persons.  It is common in Israel for a landlord or real estate agent to leave bread and salt in the home to welcome new tenants, as these should be the first things brought into a new home.

It is an important part of the culture.  It is given on all good occasions: during weddings, house warming parties, and childbirth.

===Iranian culture===
{{clarify span|In the [[Iranian culture]] when a guest is welcomed into the home, it's said that they have eaten Bread and salt, and this leads to loyalty of the guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vajehyab.com/dehkhoda/%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86+%D9%88+%D9%86%D9%85%DA%A9 | title=نان و نمک | publisher=Dehkhoda Dictionary | accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|date=February 2016}}

===United Kingdom===
In Northern England and Scotland the tradition is observed on New Year's Day, where the first individual to enter a house may be required by tradition to bring bread, salt and coal.

===In Space===
With the advent of the [[Soviet space program]], this tradition has spread into space, where appropriately small packages of bread and salt are used nowadays.&lt;ref name=TDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kosmonavtika/&gt; It was observed at the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] and the [[Salyut programme]], when [[Cracker (food)|crackers]] and salt tablets were used in the spaceship. &lt;!--as described in [[Soyus 27]] article--&gt; Bread chunks and salt were a welcome at the [[Mir]] space station,&lt;ref name=TDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kosmonavtika/&gt; a tradition that was extended on the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name=Kosmonavtika/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Feast-of-bread-and-salt-awaits-space-station-crew/2005/04/17/1113676650147.html |title=Feast of bread and salt awaits space station crew - World |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2003-02-01 |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bread and salt are also a welcome for cosmonauts returning to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/general/146225/capsule_brings_3_astronauts_back_to_earth/ ]{{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of serving bread and salt to guests is a recurring reference in [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, where the welcome ritual serves as not only as a [[Westeros]]i tradition of hospitality but also a formal assurance of "guest right", a sacred bond of trust and honor guaranteeing that nobody in attendance, hosts and guests alike, shall be harmed.  Violating the guest right is widely considered among the highest moral crimes, an affront worthy of the worst [[damnation]], rivaled only by kinslaying. [[Game of Thrones]], the associated television series, prominently features the tradition in season three, episode 9, "The Rains of Castamere." Rival noble houses Stark and Frey are meeting to discuss a marriage alliance. The Starks fear betrayal by the Freys, but their worries are assuaged when the most important members of each house eat bread and salt from the same platter, establishing guest right, although the Freys eventually break the oath by murdering most of the Starks present at the wedding.

In Season 2, Episode 4 of [[Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)|Peaky Blinders]], Alfie Solomons offers [[Charles Sabini]] bread and salt as Sabini offers a white flag of truce. 

[[Rudyard Kipling]] referenced bread and salt in a number of works. In ''[[The Ballad of East and West]]'', leavened bread and salt is mentioned as binding an oath of blood brothership.  At the beginning of ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'' Puck establishes his credentials with the child protagonists by asking them to sprinkle plenty of salt on their shared meal. ""That'll show you the sort of person I am."

In [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s historical novel Outcast, bread and salt is referred to as a sign of belonging to a tribe: "You are my people, my own people, by hearth fire and bread and salt".

In the ''Count of Monte Cristo'' by Alexandre Dumas, Chapter 72 is titled "Bread and Salt." The character Mercedes attempts to coax the main character into eating fruit, as part of an Arabian custom to ensure that those who have shared food and drink together under one roof would be eternal friends. 

In D.R. Merrill's 2014 science fiction novel ''Lamikorda'' the Alplai greet the leaders of the Terran colony vessel with a ritual meal of foods representing their major cultures, including bread from the Saakh; one of the Terrans then presents a small container of [[sea salt]], which is graciously accepted and added as a symbol of their friendship.

Bread and salt are given as a housewarming gift in one scene of the 1946 film ''[[It's A Wonderful Life]]''.

'''Cebu Taoist Temple''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 宿霧定光寶殿) is a [[Taoism|Taoist]] temple located in Beverly Hills Subdivision of [[Cebu City]], [[Philippines]]. The temple is built by [[Cebu]]'s substantial [[Chinese in the Philippines|Chinese]] community in 1972.&lt;ref name="Fabulous Philippines"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fabulousphilippines.com/taoist-temple-cebu.html |title=Taoist Temple, Cebu City |work=Cebu |publisher=Fabulous Philippines |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With an elevation of {{convert|300|m}} above sea level, the temple is a towering, multi-tiered, multi-hued attraction accessible by three separate winding routes.

Unlike the neighboring Phu Sian Temple,&lt;ref name="Phu-Sian"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncebu.com/images/phu-sian-temple.html |work=Travel and Tours |title=Phu-Sian Temple |publisher=just.click.it ncebu |accessdate=2008-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106140050/http://www.ncebu.com/images/phu-sian-temple.html |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Taoism|Taoist]] temple is open to the worshipers and non-worshipers alike. A ritual among devotees is where one prays to the gods to grant one's wish. The ritual includes washing of hands, going inside the chapel barefoot and dropping two blocks of wood. If the blocks of wood are both face up then one could make a wish. If not then it is not yet the time for one's wish to be granted and one has to come to the temple some other time.

The temple is the center of worship for [[Taoism]], the religion which follows the teachings of the ancient Chinese philosopher, [[Lao Zi]]. Another ritual among Taoist devotees, which is done during Wednesdays and Sundays,&lt;ref name="Cebuphil"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cebu-philippines.net/taoist-temple.html |work=Attractions |title=Taoist Temple |publisher=Cebu - Philippines |accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the climbing of its 81 steps (representing the 81 chapters of Taoism scriptures) to light joss sticks and have their fortune read by the monks.

Some guide books and travel agencies offer trips to the temple or as a side-trip in a tour around Cebu City. But it is more popular with grade school students.

The entrance to the temple was a replica of the [[Great Wall of China]]. The temple includes a chapel, a library, a souvenir shop and a wishing well. The spacious balconies offer a scenic view of the downtown [[Cebu]].

{{About|Devas in [[Jainism|Jainist]] teachings|other uses|Deva (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Padmavati.JPG|thumb|Idol of [[Padmavati (Jainism)|Padmāvatī]] devī, śāsanadevī of Lord [[Parshvanatha]] at Walkeshwar Temple. She is one of the most popular demi-goddesses amongst the Jains. Worship of such persons is considered as ''mithyātva'' or wrong belief and many Jains unknowingly get involved in such worship.]]
{{Jainism}}
The ''sanskrit'' word '''Deva''' has multiple meanings in Jainism. In many places the word has been used to refer to the ''[[Tirthankara]]s'' (spiritual teachers of Dharma). But in common usage it is used to refer to the heavenly beings. These beings are born instantaneously in special beds without any parents just like [[Naraka (Jainism)|hell]] beings (''naraki'').{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=28}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=110}} According to Jain texts, clairvoyance (''avadhi jnana'') based on birth is possessed by the celestial beings.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=9}}

== Classes of Heavenly beings ==

According to Jain texts, the celestial beings are of four orders (classes):{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=51}}{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}}-
* ''Bhavanavasi'' (residential)
* ''Vyantara'' (intermediaries or peripatetic)
* ''Joytiska'' (luminaries or stellar)
* ''Vaimanika'' (Astral or heavenly beings)

There are of ten, eight, five and twelve classes up to the Heavenly beings (''kalpavasis'').{{further explanation needed|date=April 2017}} There are ten grades in each of these classes of celestial beings, the Lord (Indra), his Equal, the Minister, the courtiers, the bodyguards, the police, the army, the citizens, the servants, and the menials.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=52}}

==Abode==
{{main|Heaven#Jainism}}
The abode of Devas is ''Svarga'' (heaven).{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=110}} According to Jain texts, persons with right faith (except those whose bondage of life-karma has been accomplished prior to their attainment of right belief) are reborn among the fourth order of ''devas'' and not among the three lower orders, namely the Residential, the Peripatetic and the Stellar ''devas''. Those practising restraint with attachment and restraint-cum-non-restraint are also characterized by right belief. Hence they are reborn in the higher heavens of ''Saudharma Kalpa'' and so on and not among the three lower orders of celestial beings.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=183}} Merit which leads to the highest celestial state such as  ''Sarvārthasiddhi'' is said to be acquired in the ''Bharata'', ''Airāvata'', and ''Videha Kshetra''{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=183}}

== Lifetime ==
1. Minimum lifetime of the Residential ''devas'' is ten thousand years.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=127}}
2. Peripatetic ''devas'' is a little over one ''palyopama''.
3.&amp;nbsp;Stellar ''devas'' same as Peripatetic ''devas''.

'''Eleanor Antin''' (née '''Fineman'''; February 27, 1935) is an American [[performance art]]ist, [[film-maker]], [[installation art]]ist, [[conceptual art]]ist and [[feminist art]]ist.&lt;ref name=Meeker2009/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Eleanor Fineman was born in the [[Bronx]] on February 27, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/antin-eleanor "Eleanor Antin"], Jewish Women's Archive; retrieved February 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents, Sol Fineman and Jeanette Efron, were Polish Jews who had recently immigrated to the United States.&lt;ref name=Meeker2009/&gt;

She attended the Music and Art High School in New York,&lt;ref name=Meeker2009/&gt; [[The New School|New School for Social Research]], and then the [[City College of New York]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-02/entertainment/ca-50055_1_art-world|title=ART : Ever the 'Wicked Little Girl' : Eleanor Antin's works may be on the fringe, but her audience isn't. Her latest alter ego is a demonic little angel.|last=Ollman|first=Leah|date=April 2, 1995|work=LA Times|access-date=February 2, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduating in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/explore-the-era/people/eleanor-antin/|title=Eleanor Antin, Artist|last=|first=|date=|website=The Getty|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There she met [[David Antin]], a poet who would become her husband in 1961.&lt;ref name=Handy1989/&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa.si.edu"/&gt; She studied acting and had some roles, including performing in a staged reading with [[Ossie Davis]] at the first [[NAACP]] convention.&lt;ref name="aaa.si.edu"/&gt; She and her husband moved to San Diego in 1968.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

She taught at the [[University of California at Irvine]] from 1974–79, and from 1979 was professor of visual arts at the [[University of California at San Diego]].&lt;ref name=DWA1997/&gt;

== Career ==
When she began her artistic career in New York, she started off as a painter and later turned to making assemblages, but starting in the 1960s she began to do the conceptual projects that would become her focus. The first was ''Blood of a Poet Box'' (1965-1968), in which she took blood samples from poets and put them on slides. The work, which was inspired by [[Jean Cocteau]]’s film ''Blood of a Poet'', eventually held 100 samples, including blood from [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]],&lt;ref name=Knight1999 /&gt; and is in the collection of the [[Tate Modern]].&lt;ref name="aaa.si.edu"/&gt;

In 1969, she created a portrait, ''Molly Barnes'', out of "a lush lavender bath rug, a noisy electric Lady Schick razor, a patch of spilled talcum powder and a scattering of pink and yellow pills."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: Sourcebook of Artist Writings|edition=Second|last=Stiles|first=Kristine|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|isbn=9780520257184|location=Berkeley|pages=892–894}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Molly Barnes'' was just one of a series of "semantic portraits of people, sometimes real, some-times fictional, [made] out of configurations of brand-new consumer goods" that Antin created.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''100 Boots'' is Antin's best-known [[conceptual art|conceptual work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eleanor Antin profile|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/explore-the-era/people/eleanor-antin|publisher=Pacific Standard Time at the Getty Center|accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this project, she set up 100 boots in various configurations and settings, photographed them, and created 51 postcards of the images that were mailed to hundreds of recipients around the world from 1971-73.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Boots|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/explore-the-era/worksofart/100-boots|publisher=Pacific Standard Time at the Getty Center|accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''100 Boots'' relied on the recipients to remember and construct the boots' adventures, as the postcards were mailed out at intervals ranging from 3 days to 5 weeks "depending upon what [Antin] took to be the 'internal necessities' of the narrative."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It documents the boots in a mock picaresque photo [[diary]], beginning at the [[Pacific Ocean]] and ending in New York City, where their journey was presented in an exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

In a famous performance work of 1972, ''Carving: A Traditional Sculpture'', Antin photographed her naked body at 148 successive stages during a month of crash-dieting.&lt;ref name=Stein1989/&gt; The somber, almost classical work is a staple of early feminist art, according to the New York Times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In ''The Eight Temptations'', 1972, Antin poses in mock histrionic gestures, resisting the temptation to eat [[snack food]]s that would violate her diet. In the 1970s/80s, she created several videos in which she played invented personae, including an Elizabethan-style king, a Romantic-era ballerina, a contemporary black movie star called Eleanora Antinova, and Eleanor Nightingale, a character that is a combination of [[Florence Nightingale]] and the artist herself.&lt;ref name=Knight1999/&gt;

In 1974, Antin described these impersonations as part of her overarching interest in the transformational nature of the self: "I was interested in defining the limits of myself. I consider the usual aids to self-definition—sex, age, talent, time and space—as tyrannical limitations upon my freedom of choice."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

From the 70s until the 90s Antin embodied multiple alter egos in a project that she called "Selves" that implemented through several art forms. This project encompassed  four videos: ''The King'' (1972), ''The Ballerina and the Bum'' (1974), ''The Adventures of a Nurse'' (1976), and ''From the Archives of Modern Art'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/artists/8183|title=Eleanor Antin {{!}} MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Antin completed two large scale photographic series inspired by Roman history and mythology: ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'', 2002, and ''Roman Allegories'', 2005. Her work was profiled in Season Two of the [[PBS]] series [[Art:21]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eleanor Antin|work=Art in the Twenty First Century|url=https://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/eleanor-antin|publisher=Art21, Inc.|accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has had dozens of [[solo exhibition]]s and has been represented in countless group exhibitions, including at the [[Hirshhorn Museum]], the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Los Angeles, the [[Kunsthalle Wien]], and [[documenta]] 12 in Kassel.&lt;ref name="brooklynmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: Feminist Art Base: Eleanor Antin |publisher=Brooklyn Museum|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_art_base/gallery/eleanorantin.php|accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is in the permanent collections of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]], and the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eleanor Antin profile|url=http://visarts.ucsd.edu/faculty/eleanor-antin|publisher=University of California at San Diego|accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work is largely concerned with issues of identity and the role of women in society.&lt;ref name=Stein1989/&gt; "I was determined to present women without pathos or helplessness," she wrote in a feminist artist statement for the Brooklyn Museum.&lt;ref name="brooklynmuseum.org"/&gt;

In a 2009 interview, Antin described her path to becoming an artist: "When I was a kid, I didn't know what kind of artist I was. I knew I was an artist, I just didn't know if I was an actor, I didn't know if I was a writer, I didn't even know if I was a painter. I was fortunate that I grew up as an artist in a time when all the barriers were falling down. It was a time of invention and discovery. I was lucky."&lt;ref name="aaa.si.edu"/&gt;

In 2013, Antin published an autobiographical novel, ''Conversations with Stalin'', about "a young girl's struggle to find her way from her crazy dysfunctional family of first generation Jewish Stalinist immigrants", and "her desperate, endearing, often hilarious quest for art, self, revolution and sex, abetted by a kindly avuncular Stalin dispensing bizarre advice."&lt;ref name=Hoberman2014/&gt;

Medical work was centered in [[Moyobamba]] and [[Cajamarca]]. The first church work was started in 1921. The first church was built in [[Cajamarca]] in 1936 with 600 people present. The work spread to [[Tarapoto]] and [[Chachapoyas, Peru|Chachapoyas]]. But there was shortage of pastors and elders. The first General Assembly was held in 1963 with 5 presbyteries namely the [[Amazonas Region|Amazonas]], Cajamarca, [[Lima]], [[Celendin]] and [[San Martín Province|San Martin]], and the church become independent. The name of the denomination was Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Peru. The church had 3,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;http://recursosteologicos.org/Documents/Mision_Peru_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

American Missionaries, of [[Bible Presbyterian Church]], established another church in 1936. The first General assembly was held in 1970. The name of the denomination was National Presbyterian Church of Peru. In 1983 the church had 11 presbyteries with 8,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=1451&amp;lg=eng&lt;/ref&gt;

These churches were united in 1995 to form the Evangelical Presbyterian and Reformed Church in Peru. In the early 2000s the EPRCP had 140 congregations and 15,000 members in [[Peru]].

The '''Shrine of Fatima Masumeh''' ({{lang-fa|حرم فاطمه معصومه}}) is located in [[Qom]], which is considered by Shia Muslims to be the second most sacred city in Iran after [[Mashhad]].

[[Fatima Masumeh]] was the sister of the eighth [[Imam]] [['Ali al-Rida|Reza]] and the daughter of the seventh Imam [[Musa al-Kadhim]] (Tabari 60). In [[Shia Islam]], women are often revered as saints if they are close relatives to one of the [[Twelver]] Imams. Fatima Masumeh is therefore honored as a saint, and her shrine in Qom is considered one of the most significant Shi'i shrines in Iran. Every year, thousands of Shi'i Muslims travel to Qom to honor Fatima Masumeh and ask her for blessings.

Also buried within the shrine are three daughters of the ninth Twelver Shī‘ah Imām [[Muhammad al-Taqī]].&lt;ref name="site 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacredsites.com/middle_east/iran/qum.htm |title=Qum, Iran |accessdate=12 March 2009 |work=sacredsites.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
The mosque consists of a burial chamber, three courtyards and three large prayer halls, totalling an area of {{convert|38000|m2|abbr=on}}. The three prayer halls are named: ''Tabātabā'ī'', ''Bālā Sar'', and ''A‘dham''.&lt;ref name=Jaffer2003&gt;{{cite book |title=Lady Fatima Masuma (a) of Qum |last=Jaffer |first=Masuma |year=2003 |publisher=Jami'at al-Zahra |location=Qum |url=http://www.al-islam.org/masumaqum/ |isbn=964-438-455-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Modarresi"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.indiasnews.com/details/Qom_Province | title = Today's Top StoriesQom Province | accessdate = 18 December 2006 | publisher = indiasnews.com | quote = Shrine of Hazrat Masoumeh, sister of Imam Reza, one of Iran's holiest places, is in Qom. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081220135703/http://www.indiasnews.com/details/Qom_Province | archivedate = 20 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visiting the Shrine==
[[File:Fatima Masuma Qum Dome.jpg|thumb|The golden dome above the mausoleum]]
Though Shi'i theology formally states that the relatives of the Imams, or [[imamzadehs]], hold a lower status than the Imams, popular Shi'ism still strongly venerates imamzadehs.&lt;ref name=Canby2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Canby|first=Sheila R.|title=Shah 'Abbas: The Remaking of Iran|year=2009|publisher=The British Museum Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Iran, there are many more burial places of the Imams' relatives than there are for the Imams themselves.&lt;ref name=Canby2009/&gt; Imamzadehs are considered to be close to God and religiously pious because of their close relation to Imams.&lt;ref name=Betteridge2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Betteridge|first=Anne H.|title=Everyday Life in the Muslim Middle East|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|pages=276-289|edition=2|editor=Donna Lee Bowen and Evelyn A. Early|chapter=Muslim Women and Shrines in Shiraz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shi'is commonly travel on pilgrimages to shrines of imamzadehs, such as the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh, the sister of the 8th Imam 'Ali al-Rida, in Qom, Iran. Men and women seek cures to ailments, solutions to problems, and forgiveness of sins at these sites.&lt;ref name=Betteridge2002/&gt; Many hadiths, or teachings, are recorded from Shi'i Imams praising the veneration of Fatima Masumeh, and proclaiming that those who make a pilgrimage to her Shrine will "certainly be admitted to heaven."&lt;ref name=Jaffer2003/&gt;

Fatima Masumeh's Shrine in Qom is crowded every day of the year with Shi'i men, women, and children from all around the world. Some stay for hours or days praying at the mosque and circumambulating her tomb. The economy of Qom has become reliant on this pilgrimage for the tourism it brings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Majd|first=Hooman|title=The Ayyatolah Begs to Differ: The Paradox of Modern Iran.|year=2008|publisher=First Anchor Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Qom has remained conservative and traditional to maintain a pious environment for pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khosrokhavar|first=Farhad|title=Gender in Contemporary Iran: Pushing the boundaries|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=99-119|editor=Roksana Bahramitash and Eric Hooglund|chapter=Post-revolutionary Iranian youth: The case of Qom and the new culture of ambivalence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many miracles have been recorded as taking place at this shrine, and they are documented in a special office within the shrine complex. Some are published in the shrines monthly newspaper, the Payam-e Astan.&lt;ref name=Jaffer2003/&gt;

Pilgrims at the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh follow rituals that have been passed down for centuries. Imam [[Ali al-Rida]], Fatima Masumeh's brother, outlined these ritual acts as he described the way he visited her Shrine. The prayer Imam al-Rida dictated to his sister continues to be part of the pilgrimage.&lt;ref name=Canby2009/&gt; Since the Safavid period, additional rituals have been added that are now typical for many Shi'i pilgrimages including ritual washing beforehand, dressing in perfumed clothing, and entering the site with one's right foot.&lt;ref name=Canby2009/&gt;

==History of the Shrine==

===Early history===
Since the beginning of Qom's history in the 7th century, the city has been associated with Shi'ism and set apart from the Sunni caliphate.&lt;ref name=Canby2009/&gt; Many Shi'i hadiths referred to Qom as a "place of refuge for believers," calling it a deeply religious place. After Fatima Masumeh's death in Qom and the construction of her Shrine, scholars began to gather in Qom and the city gained its reputation for religious learning. Today, Qom is still noted for its religious seminaries and organizations.&lt;ref name=Jaffer2003/&gt;

Fatima Masumeh died in Qom in 201 A.H. as she travelled to join her brother, Imam [[Ali al-Rida]] in Khorasan.&lt;ref name=Jaffer2003/&gt; The caravan she travelled in was attacked in Saveh by the Abbasid Sunnis, and 23 of Fatima Masumeh's family and friends were killed (Jaffer). Fatima Masumeh was then poisoned by a woman from the Sunni enemies, fell ill, and asked to be taken to Qom, where she died.&lt;ref name=Jaffer2003/&gt; Fatima Masumeh's host in Qom buried her in his plot of land.&lt;ref name=Canby2009/&gt;

The style of Fatima Masumeh's Shrine has developed over many centuries.&lt;ref name=Allan2012&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=James W.|title=The Art and Architecture of Twelver Shi'ism: Iraq, Iran, and the Indian Sub-Continent|year=2012|publisher=Azimuth Editions|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, her tomb was covered with a bamboo canopy.&lt;ref name=Canby2009/&gt; Fifty years later, this was replaced by a more durable domed building, at the request of the daughter of Imam [[Muhammad at-Taqī]], Sayyida Zaynab.&lt;ref name=Canby2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaffer2003/&gt; The family of Sayyida Zainab later added a further two domes to the Shrine.&lt;ref name=Canby2009/&gt; These architectural projects marked the beginning of female patronage of the tomb of Fatima Masumeh.

=== Safavid period ===
In 1519, [[Tajlu Khanum]], the wife of Shah [[Isma'il I]], led a project to improve the drainage around the Shrine, embellish the Shrine with an [[iwan]] and two minarets, and reconstruct the tomb chamber as a domed octagon. During the [[Safavid dynasty]], the women of this family were very active in embellishing the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh. In times of war, Safavid royal women found refuge in Qom, and likely compared their situation to that of Fatima Masumeh. These women donated beautiful fabrics and other items to the Shrine. [[Shah Abbas I]] of the Safavids did not patronize the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh as much as he did other shrines of Imams, but he did offer books to the Shrine's seminary library.&lt;ref name=Canby2009/&gt; Over the years, many Safavids of royal birth were buried close to the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh.

===Modern history===
[[File:Eid_al-Fitr_prayer,_Fatima_Masuma_Shrine,_Qom,_Iran_2.jpg|thumb|[[Eid al-Fitr]] prayer, Fatima Masuma Shrine, 2017]]
From 1795-1796, [[Fath-Ali Shah Qajar]] converted two Safavid ''sahn'' or courtyards into one large courtyard and, in 1803, fixed the golden dome. In 1883, Amin al-Sultan added the new ''sahn e-jadid'' or "New Court" to the Shrine complex.&lt;ref name=Allan2012/&gt;

During [[Ayatollah Khomeini]]'s 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], Qom was named "the birthplace" of this movement. Khomeini studied in Qom and lived there at the beginning and end of the Revolution. Aspects of the culture of Qom, including the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh, were used to unite the Iranian people over significant historical and mythical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rivzi|first=Kishwar|title=Religious Icon and National Symbol: The Tomb of Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran |journal=Muqarnas |year=2003 |volume=20 |pages=209–224|doi=10.1163/22118993-90000045}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khomeini used images of the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh in posters, money, and stamps created during the Revolution.&lt;ref name=Allan2012/&gt; Khomeini also constructed an addition to the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh and added more space for pilgrims.&lt;ref name=Jaffer2003/&gt; In addition, the tomb of Ayatollah Khomeini utilizes architectural elements that are similar to Fatima Masumeh's Shrine, such as the golden dome.&lt;ref name=Allan2012/&gt; See [[Mausoleum of Khomeini]].

== Career ==

=== Television ===

==== ''Mock the Week'' (2005–2009) ====
{{Main|Mock the Week}}
Boyle was a regular on the BBC panel show ''[[Mock the Week]]'' from its first episode on 5 June 2005 until 17 September 2009. A show in which the panel comment humorously on various news stories from the [[Media of the United Kingdom|British media]], ''Mock the Week'' is hosted by [[Dara Ó Briain]], who in an episode of ''Live at the Apollo'' referred to Boyle as "the dark heart of ''Mock the Week''."&lt;ref name="boyletimesonline"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/comedy/article5037516.ece |title=Is Frankie Boyle the UK's most shocking comic? |publisher=Times Online |date=1 November 2008 |accessdate=28 May 2015 | location=London | first=Stephen | last=Dalton | deadurl=yes | archivedate=15 June 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615134953/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/comedy/article5037516.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his [[black comedy|morbid sense of humour]], which plays on negative images of celebrities, politicians, and society (particularly his home country of Scotland). On 2 October 2009, Boyle announced via the ''Mock the Week''{{'}}s Facebook fan page that he was leaving the show to concentrate on other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/8287297.stm |title=Boyle leaves Mock The Week panel, BBC, 2 October 2009 |publisher=BBC News |date=2 October 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle has since criticised both the show's production team and the [[BBC Trust]]. He claims that the show did not cover enough major news stories, and was too restrictive on his risqué comedy act because the producers and the BBC Trust were afraid of "frightening the horses".&lt;ref name="MSN"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Frankie Boyle slams Mock The Week |url=http://tv.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=150480748&amp;GT1=61503 |work=uk.msn |date=27 October 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is seen in archive footage of ''Mock the Week'' on the 2009 Christmas Special, which aired on 22 December 2009, as a series of "Best Bits and Festive Clips", in a compilation celebrating the show's 100th episode on 5 July 2012 as well as in archive footage on the 2012 Christmas Special, which aired on 27 December 2012.

==== ''Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights'' (2010) ====
{{Main|Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights}}
In October 2009, Boyle piloted a sketch and stand-up show for [[Channel 4]], entitled ''Deal with This, Retards'' to be produced by RDF Scotland subsidiary the [[Comedy Unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker |first=Robin |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/broadcasters/bbc/boyle-quits-mock-the-week/5006386.article |title=Broadcast Now, 2 October 2009 |publisher=Broadcastnow.co.uk |date=2 October 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle mentioned on ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' that the original title of the show had been dropped, due to its offensive nature, and been renamed ''[[Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights|Tramadol Nights]]'' and aired from the end of November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a259760/frankie-boyle-dismisses-comedy-controversy.html|title=Frankie Boyle dismisses comedy controversy|author=Mayer Nissim|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official page launched via Channel 4's official website, which confirmed that the show's full name is ''Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights'' and the series was made up of six episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/frankie-boyles-tramadol-nights |title=Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights |publisher=Channel 4 |date=29 December 2010 |accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle caused controversy on the show with his comments about [[Katie Price]] and [[Dwight Yorke]]'s disabled son Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0028/46729/obb179.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Frankie Boyle's Rehabilitation Programme'' pilot (2011) ====

On 21 August 2011, it was revealed that Channel 4 had given Boyle permission to record a pilot for a topical talk show in October of that year, which would be called ''Frankie Boyle's Rehabilitation Programme'' (despite the controversy surrounding ''Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights''). Channel 4 head of comedy Shane Allen told the press that "it's very much like ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' or ''[[Wogan]]'', but with paedo jokes" and that the show would feature Frankie "in a studio, riffing off the audience a bit with some people challenging what he says".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/aug/21/frankie-boyle-pilot-channel-4 |title=Channel 4 line up return for Frankie Boyle |publisher=The Guardian |date=21 August 2011 |accessdate=17 June 2012 |location=London |first=Patrick |last=Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''The Boyle Variety Performance'' (2012) ====
''The Boyle Variety Performance'' was broadcast on 19 August 2012 and featured Boyle with guests [[Rob Delaney (comedian)|Rob Delaney]], [[Nick Helm]], [[Katherine Ryan]] and [[Tom Stade]]. A few days after the show was broadcast, Boyle attracted criticism after he posted jokes on Twitter about the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/31/frankie-boyle-paralympics-twitter-jokes?newsfeed=true |title=Frankie Boyle Paralympics Twitter jokes prove last straw for Channel 4 |publisher=The Guardian |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2012 |location=London |first=Josh |last=Halliday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Gasping'' (2014) ====
In 2014, Frankie Boyle starred in the short comedy film ''Gasping'' for BBC Scotland, written by [[Greg Hemphill]]. The title refers to an expression in [[Scottish English]], communicative of an irresistible compulsion to do something, such as smoke a cigarette; or, as here, to drink alcohol. The short feature, an at-times-farcical but generally deadpan treatment of a man's attempted recovery from alcoholism.

==== ''Frankie Boyle's Autopsy Series'' (2014–2016) ====
''Frankie Boyle's Referendum Autopsy'' was released on 28 September 2014, and ''Frankie Boyle's Election Autopsy'' was released on 17 May 2015, through [[BBC iPlayer]]. Featuring guests Katherine Ryan and [[Sara Pascoe]], Boyle dissected the [[Scottish independence referendum]], 2014 and [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/20/frankie-boyle-bbc-election-autopsy-comedy-iplayer|title=Frankie Boyle’s Election Autopsy is too hot for TV – so much the better|last=Logan|first=Brian|date=20 May 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Frankie Boyle's American Autopsy'' dissected the buildup and fallout of the United States presidential election, tackling topics such as feminism, entertainment, propaganda, and guns. Special guests include Sara Pascoe, Katherine Ryan, [[Michelle Wolf]], Desiree Burch, and [[Richard Osman]].

==== ''Frankie Boyle's New World Order'' (2017–present) ====
A show similar to his BBC iPlayer exclusive "autopsy" shows, Boyle returned to TV on [[BBC Two]], with his ''[[Frankie Boyle's New World Order]]'', which follows a very similar structure to the aforementioned programmes, where Frankie makes two statements, and discusses them with his guests. The difference is that the studio audience do not vote on if they agree with that statement. The show premiered on 8 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-05-25/bbc2-to-broadcast-new-frankie-boyle-satirical-show-right-after-general-election-polls-close|title=Frankie Boyle' new BBC political comedy to air right after UK Election 2017 polls close|last=Dowell|first=Ben|date=25 May 2017|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sitcom set in a small regional theatre starring [[David Mitchell (comedian)|David Mitchell]] as a happy-go-lucky writer with writer's block written by Frankie Boyle and Steven Dick, broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] on 5 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/blocked/ | title=Blocked |publisher=British Comedy Guide |accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Live shows ===
In October 2007 Boyle embarked on a stand-up tour of Britain, playing over 100 dates and enjoying a sold-out run that was extended through until December 2008. Boyle said that he planned to quit stand-up before he turned 40, had written his final tour and plans to do more television work after this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/07/02/9213/boyle%3A_im_quitting_stand-up |title=Boyle: I'm Quitting Stand up |publisher=Chortle.co.uk |date= |accessdate=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle performed the tour, entitled ''I Would Happily Punch Every One of You in the Face'' between March and December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/Frankie-Boyle-Live-tickets/artist/953249?CAMEFROM=CFC_UK_EV0542_WEBLINK |title=Frankie Boyle Live Tickets |publisher=Ticketmaster |date= |accessdate=7 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:FrankieBoyleLiveDVD.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of his live DVD]] --&gt;

On 21 November 2011, at a "Meet the Comedians" session in the [[Apple Store]], [[Regent Street]] with [[Jimmy Carr]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/meet-comedians-jimmy-carr/id484003108 |title=iTunes – Podcasts – Meet the Comedians: Jimmy Carr and Frankie Boyle by Events at the Apple Store |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=28 November 2011 |accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle announced he was doing another tour entitled ''The Last Days of Sodom'', despite intending ''I Would Happily Punch Every One of You in the Face'' to be his final one. He mentioned the tour will not be as long as its predecessor. His website has stated it will run from July to December 2012 with more dates to be added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frankieboyle.com/tourdates.html |title=Frankie Boyle |publisher=Frankie Boyle |date= |accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tickets went on sale in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/Frankie-Boyle-Live-tickets/artist/33779 |title=Frankie Boyle Live Tickets 2012|publisher=Ticketmaster |date= |accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DVD releases ===
On 10 November 2008, Boyle's first DVD was released,&lt;ref name="boyletimesonline" /&gt; featuring a sell-out stand-up performance given at London's [[Hackney Empire]] and some additional material, including a documentary about the tour, entitled ''Fuck You Scotland'', and some sketches from the [[BBC Three]] comedy ''[[Rush Hour (UK TV series)|Rush Hour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Frankie Boyle Live DVD |titlelink= |year= |others=Brian Klein |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |location= |id= |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD was described by WhatDVD.net as "certainly not one to watch with your grandparents – not unless they are pretty open-minded!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lianne |url=http://www.whatdvd.net/frankie-boyle-live-dvd-review-122.html |title=Frankie Boyle Live DVD Review |publisher=WhatDVD.net |date=13 November 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle has also featured in three DVD compilations of material from ''[[Mock the Week]]''. The compilations, entitled ''Too Hot for TV'', include material deemed too offensive for broadcast on TV and uncut versions of several full episodes. Boyle's second live DVD, ''If I Could Reach Out Through Your TV and Strangle You I Would'', was released on 15 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/12041662/Frankie-Boyle-Live-2-I-Would-Happily-Punch-Every-One-Of-You-In-The-Face/Product.html |title=''Play.com'' – Frankie Boyle Live 2 |publisher=Play.com |date= |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Podcast ===
On 16 July 2009, Boyle's first podcast was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=114749422&amp;blogId=500565493 |title=Frankie's Podcast |publisher=MySpace |date=16 July 2009 |accessdate=30 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=6 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106081646/http://www.myspace.com/frankieboylelive/blog/500565493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled ''Mock the Week Musings'', the podcast is a recording of Boyle testing the material he has written for ''Mock the Week'' to a London audience. Boyle comments on his material throughout and often informs the audience that certain jokes are not going into the show due to their reaction (or lack thereof), and the podcast carries an explicit content warning. The recording includes some audience interaction, with Boyle offering to test some of his new "put-downs" on the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast | url=https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=323684930 | title=Mock The Week Musings | website=[[iTunes]] | publisher=BBC | host=Frankie Boyle | date=16 July 2009 | accessdate =24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2013 and 2015, Boyle, along with Canadian comedian [[Glenn Wool]] hosted a number of editions of a podcast known as Freestyle, which involved Boyle and Wool speaking about topical and controversial news stories, including [[Madeleine McCann]], [[Bill Cosby]], and obscure takes on popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast | title=Freestyle |url=http://frankieboyle.podbean.com/ |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comic book ===
In September 2010, Boyle began publishing his comic strip ''Rex Royd'' in the launch issue of ''[[CLiNT]]'' magazine, co-written with comedian Jim Muir and with artwork by Michael Dowling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=37302 |title=CLINT WEEK: COMEDIAN FRANKIE BOYLE ROCKS "REX ROYD" |publisher=CBR |date=2 March 2012 |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story follows a [[Lex Luthor]]-style newspaper magnate with a super-villain alter-ego. Initially, the strip ran for first four issues of ''CLiNT''. The strip resumed again in November 2011, until the final issue in August 2013, when publisher [[Titan Magazines|Titan]] announced that ''CLiNT'' was ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=47315 |title=Comicbookresources.com |publisher=Comicbookresources.com |date=14 August 2013 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other appearances ===
Boyle appeared as himself in the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned]]'' (2009), in a stand-up routine at Liberty City's Split Sides Comedy Club. He appeared on Real Radio Wales's weekly comedy show ''Comedy Nighthorse'' on 19 October 2011. Boyle writes satire and opinion pieces for the British newspaper [[The Guardian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/frankie-boyle|title=Frankie Boyle|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Boyle has regularly been involved in public controversies due to the acerbic nature of his humour.

=== Rebecca Adlington ===
Boyle managed to attract criticism in August 2008 when complaints were received about comments he made regarding British Olympic swimmer [[Rebecca Adlington]] on ''Mock the Week'', saying that she "looks like someone who's looking at themselves in the back of a [[spoon]]". The BBC ruled that the jokes were indeed "humiliating" and "risked offending the audience", while also calling Boyle "a brilliant member of the team".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8314495.stm |title='Mock' rapped over swimmer jibes |publisher=BBC |date=19 October 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Adlington's agent said that simply admitting mistakes was not enough, saying: "By giving Frankie Boyle a rebuke they fail to discourage others from doing the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8337421.stm |title=Swimmer queries Mock show ruling |publisher=BBC |date=2 November 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adlington later went on to comment on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8575567/Rebecca-Adlington-Im-over-the-Frankie-Boyle-spoon-jibe.html |title=Rebecca Adlington: I'm over the Frankie Boyle spoon jibe |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=20 October 2011 |location=London |first=Anita |last=Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Queen ===
In October 2008, during [[The Russell Brand Show prank telephone calls row|''The Russell Brand Show'' prank telephone calls row]], Boyle found himself in the midst of a scandal when the BBC broadcast a ''Mock the Week'' repeat in which he made a joke about [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]]. Whilst pretending to be the Queen in the "Scenes We'd Like To See" segment of ''Mock The Week'', Boyle said "I am now so old, my pussy is haunted". This caused many to complain about the state that the BBC had come to, with [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[David Davies (Welsh politician)|David Davies]] calling the joke a "disgracefully foul comment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rashid Razaq |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23580712-corporation-attacked-for-offensive-joke-about-the-queen.do |title=Corporation attacked for offensive joke about the Queen |publisher=ThisIsLondon.co.uk |date=31 October 2008 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle was eventually cleared of any misconduct by the BBC Trust, although they called the comment "sexist and ageist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Tara Conlan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/19/frankie-boyle-mock-the-week |title=Frankie Boyle's 'sexist' joke about Queen cleared by BBC Trust |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 October 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Down's syndrome ===
In a performance on his 2010 tour, Boyle interrupted a "long, seemingly semi-improvised skit" about [[Down syndrome]] by challenging a woman in the front row who seemed uncomfortable with the material.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; The audience member explained that her five-year-old daughter had the condition and strongly criticised Boyle's portrayal of people with Down syndrome.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Walker | first = Peter | title = Frankie Boyle meets his match in mother of a child with Down syndrome | newspaper = The Guardian | publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited | date = 8 April 2010  | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/apr/08/frankie-boyle-downs-syndrome  | accessdate =12 April 2010 | location=London | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

=== Palestine and Israel ===
In April 2010, the [[BBC Trust]]'s Editorial Standards Committee apologised for a joke made by Boyle on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] panel show ''[[Political Animal (radio show)|Political Animal]]'' in which he likened the situation in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] to "a cake being punched to pieces by a very angry [[Jewish|Jew]]". Boyle also made another joke where he said that he had "been studying Israeli Army martial arts. I now know 16 ways to kick a Palestinian woman in the back".&lt;ref name="palestinerow"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8650254.stm |title=BBC apologises for Frankie Boyle joke |publisher=BBC |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Boyle published a letter in which he criticised the Trust's "cowardly rebuke of my jokes about Palestine" and reprinted the jokes in question. He then criticised the BBC for not broadcasting a humanitarian appeal during the 2008–2009 [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]], saying that it was "tragic for such a great institution but it is now cravenly afraid of giving offence and vulnerable to any kind of well drilled lobbying." Boyle then said that the situation in Palestine "seems to be, in essence, apartheid", concluding that he had reached this position after watching a documentary about life in Palestine that he said had driven him to tears.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Boyle | first = Frankie | author-link =   | title = Frankie Boyle letter about BBC in full  | newspaper = The Telegraph  | date = 1 May 2010  | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/7660232/Frankie-Boyle-letter-about-BBC-in-full.html  | accessdate =1 May 2010 | location=London  | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Boyle accused BBC television producers of "editing out" comments he made on ''New World Order'' about [[2018 Gaza border protests| Palestinian deaths on the Gaza border]] and his joke about "Israel being an Apartheid state”.&lt;ref name="newworldediting"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/frankie-boyle-new-world-order-antisemitism-bbc-1.464439 |title=Frankie Boyle claims 'Apartheid' Israel jokes were cut from BBC show |publisher=The Jewish Chronichle|date=22 May 2018 |accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harvey Price ===
In December 2010, both [[Katie Price]] (a.k.a. Jordan) and [[Peter Andre]] were said to have been left "absolutely disgusted and sickened" by a joke that was made on ''[[Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights]]'' about Price's heavily disabled son, Harvey. On the show, Boyle said: "Apparently Jordan and Peter Andre are fighting each other over custody of Harvey. Well eventually one of them will lose ... and have to keep him." Then he added: "I have a theory that Jordan married a cage fighter ([[Alex Reid (fighter)|Alex Reid]]) because she needed someone strong enough to stop Harvey from fucking her."&lt;ref name="pricejoke"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Christian Tobin |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a292233/price-andre-sickened-by-frankie-boyle-joke.html |title=Price, Andre "sickened" by Frankie Boyle joke |publisher=[[DigitalSpy]] |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andre's representative also responded to the comments made by Boyle and said "We're all disgusted by these comments. Peter is angry and very upset at Harvey being mocked in this way. Children, especially a disabled youngster, should be off-limits." Both confirmed that they had sought legal action and wrote a complaint to Channel 4 regarding Boyle's jokes with Price saying: "To bully this unbelievably brave child is despicable; to broadcast it is to show a complete and utter lack of judgement. I have asked my lawyers to write to Channel 4."&lt;ref name="pricejoke" /&gt; [[Ofcom]] confirmed that Price issued a complaint and accordingly launched an investigation into the programme.&lt;ref name="tramadolinvestigated"&gt;{{Cite news|author=John Plunkett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/10/frankie-boyle-katie-price |title=Frankie Boyle's Katie Price joke sparks Ofcom investigation |publisher=The Guardian |date=10 December 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, Ofcom ruled Channel 4 had breached broadcasting rules by transmitting the material in question but did not require the network to broadcast an apology saying that it was an "erroneous decision on a matter of editorial judgment on the broadcaster's part". Price criticised the decision not to require a broadcast apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23938327-ofcom-slams-frankie-boyle-jokes-about-katie-prices-disabled-son-harvey.do |title=Ofcom slams Frankie Boyle 'jokes' about Katie Price's disabled son Harvey |publisher=Thisislondon.co.uk |date=4 April 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle discussed the material onstage at a charity gig some months later, saying that the joke was intended to highlight how Price exploited her son, and that he felt the two aspects of Price's media profile, "her disabled son and her sexuality", did not belong together. He rejected comments that the joke may have led to playground bullying, saying that "I find it hard to believe there are kids at that school who would like to slag Harvey, but can't think of an angle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2011/03/22/13005/frankie_boyle_stands_firm_over_harvey_gag |title=Chortle.co.uk |publisher=Chortle.co.uk |date=22 March 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegations of racism and  consequent libel action ===
In July 2011, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' published an article strongly criticizing Boyle which alleged he had been forced to quit ''Mock the Week'' and described him as a "racist comedian". Boyle, in response, sued the ''Mirror'' for libel. In October 2012, a jury found in his favour, ordering the ''Mirror'' to pay him £54,650 in damages, all of which he donated to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title=Frankie Boyle wins more than £50,000 libel damages from Daily Mirror|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/22/frankie-boyle-libel-damages-daily-mirror|accessdate=23 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 October 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Give It Up for Comic Relief'' ===
On 6 March 2013, Boyle caused controversy when he was invited to perform at [[Russell Brand]]'s [[BBC Three]] fundraiser ''Give It Up for Comic Relief'' at [[Wembley Arena]]. He made a series of jokes about Comic Relief itself, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]], [[Oscar Pistorius]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and the [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal]].&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/i-wish-the-queen-had-died-offensive-frankie-boyle-jokes-cut-from-bbc-comic-relief-broadcast-8524030.html|title='I wish the Queen had died': Offensive Frankie Boyle jokes cut from BBC Comic Relief broadcast|work=[[The Independent]]|date=7 March 2013|accessdate=8 April 2013|location=London|first=Daisy|last=Wyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was deemed so distasteful that his entire six-minute performance was cut out of the broadcast version of the 3.5-hour show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/03/07/frankie-boyle-russell-brand-give-it-up-for-comic-relief-_n_2826899.html | title=Frankie Boyle Axed From Russell Brand's 'Give It Up For Comic Relief' Show On BBC Three Over 'Disgusting' Jokes | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=7 March 2013 | accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Boyle supported [[Shaker Aamer]], the last UK resident being held at [[Guantanamo Bay]], by going on a [[hunger strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23389757|title=Frankie Boyle hunger strike in support of Shaker Aamer|work=BBC News|date=20 July 2013|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle is a supporter of the Glasgow-based [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] Football Club.

Boyle's comedy influences include [[Billy Connolly|Sir Billy Connolly]], [[Bill Hicks]] and [[Spike Milligan]]. The fellow Scottish shock comedian [[Jerry Sadowitz]] is often cited as an influence on Boyle, although Boyle himself has discounted this.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Boyle is a supporter of [[Scottish independence]]. When asked "How do you feel about independence?" Frankie replied with "Yes, I think we should be independent. What have we got to lose? A [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory]] government? I'm looking forward to the vote just because it will be a novelty for Scottish people to fill in official forms while still in possession of their own belt and shoelaces. And imagine what Scotland's annual Independence Day celebrations will look like; the fucking D-Day Landings." Boyle revealed via his Twitter account that he votes for the [[Scottish Green Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/comedy/features/306416-what_offends_frankie_boyle|title=What Offends Frankie Boyle?|work=The Skinny|date=4 December 2013|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hinduism in Scotland''' is all aspects of the [[Hindu]] religion in [[Scotland]]. The bulk of Scottish Hindus settled there in the second half of the 20th century. At the time of the 2001 UK Census, 5,600 people identified as Hindu, which equated to 0.1% of the Scottish population and was slightly above the number of Hindus in [[Hinduism in Wales|Wales.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/02/20757/53570 ANALYSIS OF RELIGION IN THE 2001 CENSUS: Summary Report] www.scotland.gov.uk, accessed 3 Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 UK Census, the number of Hindus in Scotland almost tripled to over 16,000 adherents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/testimony/hinduism/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Most Scottish Hindus are of [[India]]n origin, or at least from neighbouring countries, such as [[Sri Lanka]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]]. Many of these came after [[Idi Amin]]'s expulsion from [[Uganda]] in the 1970s, and some also came from [[South Africa]]. There are also a few of [[Indonesia]]n and [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] origin. 

Many of these in turn are from the [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] region of India. Common languages amongst them, other than [[English language|English]] include [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Hindi]], [[Urdu]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Nepali language|Nepali]].

==Temples==
There are several Hindu temples across the country. A temple in the West End of [[Glasgow]], opened in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5194412.stm New Hindu temple opens in Glasgow] BBC News, 19 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was severely damaged by a fire in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/10193284.stm Fire severely damages Hindu temple in Glasgow] news.bbc.co.uk, 30 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]] aka "Hare Krishna" also operates out of [[Lesmahagow]] in [[South Lanarkshire]]. There are also temples in [[Edinburgh]] and [[Dundee]] with plans announced in 2008 for a temple in [[Aberdeen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/7629100.stm Hindu temple planned for Aberdeen] BBC News, 22 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8724">'''Irreligion in New Zealand''' refers to [[atheism]], [[agnosticism]], [[deism]], [[religious scepticism]] and [[secular humanism]] in [[New Zealand]] society. Post-war New Zealand has become a highly [[secular]] country, meaning that religion does not play a major role in the lives of many of the population.

Although New Zealand has no [[established religion]], [[Christianity in New Zealand|Christianity]] has been the majority religious affiliation since [[History of New Zealand#European settlement|European settlement]] in the 19th century. The trend toward [[irreligion]] may indicate increasing [[secularisation]], as well as a rise in non-institutional spiritual belief.

==Demographics==

[[Statistics New Zealand]] gathers information on religious affiliation in the five-yearly [[census]]. Completing a census form is compulsory by law for every person in New Zealand on census night&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/about-census/participation.aspx|title=Participation in the Census|publisher=Statistics New Zealand|accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but respondents are able to object to answering the question of religious affiliation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/methods_and_services/surveys-and-methods/classifications-and-standards/classification-related-stats-standards/religious-affiliation/questionnaire-module.aspx|title=Religious Affiliation Questionnaire Model|publisher=Statistics New Zealand|accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and around 6% do object.&lt;ref name="2006table28"&gt;[http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Publications/Census/2006-reports/quickstats-subject/Culture-Identity/quickstats-about-culture-and-identity-tables.ashx Table 28, 2006 Census Data - QuickStats About Culture and Identity - Tables] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724200044/http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Publications/Census/2006-reports/quickstats-subject/Culture-Identity/quickstats-about-culture-and-identity-tables.ashx |date=2011-07-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The trend shows an increasing proportion of residents in New Zealand declaring no religious affiliation. In the 1991 census, 20.2% were in this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diverse Communities – Exploring the Migrant and Refugee Experience in New Zealand|url=http://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/research/diverse-communities-migrant-experience/migrant-experience-report.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Social Development|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion more than doubled in two decades, reaching 41.9% in the 2013 census.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-culture-identity/religion.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Younger people were more likely to indicate they had no religion; except in the 10-14 age bracket, the majority of people under 35 at the 2013 Census stated they had no religion. More males than females stated they had no religion, particularly among people aged 65 years or over.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-culture-identity/religion.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant debate among sociologists about the interpretation of this trend in census data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Olson | first = William.

The [[International Social Survey Programme]] was conducted in New Zealand by Massey University in 2008. It received mail-responses from around one thousand New Zealanders above the age of 18, surveying issues of religious belief and practice. The results of this survey indicated that 72% of the population believe in God or a higher power, 15% are [[agnostic]], and 13% are [[atheist]] (with a 3% margin of error).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicaddress.net/assets/files/ISSPReligioninNZ09.pdf|title=Religion In New Zealand: International Social Survey Programme|publisher=Massey University|accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by the American Physical Society, religion may die out in New Zealand and eight other Western world countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Religion may become extinct in nine nations, study says| publisher=BBC | date=March 2011| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12811197 | accessdate = January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=A mathematical model of social group competition with application to the growth of religious non-affiliation| journal=Physical Review Letters| volume=107| issue=8| date=January 2011| arxiv=1012.1375| last1= Abrams| first1=Daniel M.| last2= Yaple| first2=Haley A.| last3= Wiener| first3=Richard J.| doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.088701| bibcode=2011PhRvL.107h8701A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Religion set for extinction in NZ, says US study| publisher=The New Zealand Herald | date=March 22, 2011| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10714235 | accessdate = January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If current trends persist, those stating no religion will outnumber those who state a religious affiliation by the 2026 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Atheism and secularism| publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand | author=Carl Walrond | date=December 4, 2012| url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/atheism-and-secularism/3/1| accessdate = January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irreligion in society==

The [[Humanist Society of New Zealand]]  and the [[New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists]] promote a secular view of life without reference to supernatural agencies as one of their aims.

A campaign to create advertisements similar to the [[Atheist Bus Campaign]] in the United Kingdom began a fund-raising drive on 10 December 2009,&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_3149823"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/oddstuff/3149823/Theres-probably-no-God-coming-to-a-bus-near-you |title='There's probably no God' coming to a bus near you |author=Burns, Kelly |date=11 December 2009 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached its initial target of $10,000 in donations within 48 hours, making it one of the most successful atheist campaigns of all time.&lt;ref&gt;NZ Atheist Bus Campaign Blog [http://www.nogod.org.nz/2009/12/10000-and-growing-fast/ $10,000 and growing fast]&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to [[labour migration]] in the 1960s and several waves of political refugees since the 1970s, [[Islam]] has become a visible religion in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicgs.org/publication/the-many-sides-of-muslim-integration-a-german-american-comparison/ "Rauf Ceylan: Muslims in Germany: Religious and Political Challenges and Perspectives in the Diaspora],&lt;/ref&gt; According to a national census conducted in 2011, 1.9% of Germany's population (around 1.5m people) declared themselves as Muslim. However, this is likely to underestimate the true number, given that many respondents may have exercised their right not to state their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Census reveals German population lower than thought|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22727898|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
An estimate made in 2015 calculated that there are 4.4 to 4.7 million Muslims in Germany (5.4–5.7% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Publikationen/WorkingPapers/wp71-zahl-muslime-deutschland.pdf?__blob=publicationFile|Study of BAMF 14.

==Demographics==
{{further|Religion in Germany}}
Islam is the largest [[minority religion]] in the country, with the [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]] confessions being the majority religions. There are between 2.1 and 4.7 million Muslims.&lt;ref name="REMID"&gt;[http://www.remid.de/remid_info_zahlen.htm REMID Data of "Religionswissenschaftlicher Medien- und Informationsdienst"] retrieved 16 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fowid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fowid.de/fileadmin/datenarchiv/Religionszugehoerigkeit/Religionszugehoerigkeit_Bevoelkerung_Deutschland_2014.pdf |title=Religionszugehörigkeit Bevölkerung Deutschland |publisher=Forschungsgruppe Weltanschauungen in Deutschland |date= |accessdate=24 January 2016 |language=de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115132325/http://fowid.de/fileadmin/datenarchiv/Religionszugehoerigkeit/Religionszugehoerigkeit_Bevoelkerung_Deutschland_2014.pdf |archivedate=15 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge (2009).

The large majority of Muslims in Germany are of [[Turkey|Turkish]] origin (63.2%),&lt;ref name="georgetown1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/germany |title=Germany |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by smaller groups from [[Pakistan]], countries of the [[former Yugoslavia]], [[Arab world|Arab countries]], [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Most Muslims live in [[Berlin]] and the larger cities of former [[West Germany]]. However, unlike in most other European countries, sizeable Muslim communities exist in some rural regions of Germany, especially [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Hesse]] and parts of [[Bavaria]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. Owing to the lack of labour immigration before 1989, there are only very few Muslims in the former [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]]. Among the German districts with the highest share of Muslim migrants are [[Groß-Gerau (district)]] and [[Offenbach (district)]] according to migrants data from the census 2011. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kartenseite.wordpress.com/2017/04/05/muslime-in-deutschland-landkreise/ |title=Kartenseite: Muslime in Deutschland - Landkreise |publisher=kartenseite.wordpress.com |date=2017-04-05 |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Muslims in Germany are [[Sunnis]], at 75%. There are [[Shia]] Muslims (7%) and mostly from [[Iran]].{{fact|date=January 2017}} The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] organization comprise a minority of Germany's Muslims, numbering some 35,000 members or a little over 1% of the Muslim population,&lt;ref name="remid.de"&gt;''[http://remid.de/info_zahlen/islam "Mitgliederzahlen: Islam"]'', in: ''Religionswissenschaftlicher Medien- und Informationsdienst|Religionswissenschaftliche Medien- und Informationsdienst e. V. (Abbreviation: REMID)'', Retrieved 24 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and are found in 244 communities&lt;ref name="remid.de"/&gt; as of 2013.

=== Prison population ===
According to the Huffington Post in February 2018 which quired each of the 15 [[States of Germany|state]] justice ministries, 12 300 Muslims are in prison and constitute about 20% of the total 65 000 prison population in Germany which constitutes an over-representation. The highest shares are in city states of [[Bremen]] (29%), [[Hamburg]] (28%) but the share is high also in large states such as [[Hesse|Hessen]] (26%) [[Baden-Württemberg]] (26%). The share is lower in the former East Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.de/entry/muslime-haft_de_5a2a8c24e4b073789f6910f2|title=Allahs Kinder hinter Gittern: Warum in deutschen Gefängnissen so viele Muslime sitzen|date=2018-02-01|work=HuffPost Deutschland|access-date=2018-12-01|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-004-09A, Amin al Husseini und Adolf Hitler.jpg|left|thumb|Haj Amin al-Husseini meeting with Adolf Hitler (28 November 1941).]]
Muslims first moved to Germany as part of the diplomatic, military and economic relations between Germany and the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emz-berlin.de/projekte_e/pj20_1E.htm|title=emz-berlin.de|author=|date=|website=www.emz-berlin.de|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Twenty Muslim soldiers served under [[Frederick William I of Prussia]], at the beginning of the eighteenth century.  In 1745, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] established a unit of Muslims in the Prussian army called the "[[Muslim Riders]]" and consisting mainly of [[Bosniaks]], [[Albanians]] and [[Tatars]].  In 1760 a Bosniak corps was established with about 1,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick the Great's Army Albert Seaton. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gtq3GmjfgacC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=frederick+the+great+army&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mlb-Tvu7KYPT4QSevdCNCA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=frederick%20the%20great%20army&amp;f=false Islam and Muslims in Germany].  Osprey Publishing. {{ISBN|0-85045-151-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1798 a Muslim cemetery was established in Berlin.  The cemetery, which moved in 1866, still exists today.

The German section of the [[World Islamic Congress]] and the Islam Colloquium, the first German Muslim educational institution for children, were established in 1932. At this time there were 3,000 Muslims in Germany, 300 of whom were of German descent.

The Islamic Institut Ma’ahad-ul-Islam was founded in 1927 and is now known under the name "[[:de:Zentralinstitut Islam-Archiv-Deutschland|Zentralinstitut Islam-Archiv-Deutschland]]" (Central Islamic Archive Institute).

The [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]] [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] energetically recruited Muslims for the SS ([[Schutzstaffel]]), the Nazi Party’s elite military command.&lt;ref name="NYT Nazis"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/us/12holocaust.html?_r=2 |title=Declassified Papers Show U.S. Recruited Ex-Nazis |accessdate=2011-01-03 |publisher=New York Times |author=Sam Roberts |date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recruited Muslim volunteers for the German armed forces and was involved in the organization and recruitment of Muslims into several divisions of the [[Waffen SS]] and other units.

After the [[West German]] Government invited [[foreign workers]] ("[[Gastarbeiter]]") in 1961, the figure sharply rose to currently 4.3 million within two decades (most of them Turkish from the rural region of Anatolia in southeast Turkey). They are sometimes called a [[parallel society]] within ethnic Germans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.difu.de/node/5951 "Rauf Ceylan: Immigration and Socio-Spatial Segregation - Opportunities and Risks of Ethnic Self-Organisation],&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Muslims and Islamic institutions were targeted by attacks 950 times, where houses are painted with Nazi symbols, hijab-wearing women are harassed, threatening letters are sent and 33 people were injured. In nearly all cases, the perpetrators were right-wing extremists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article174153118/Innenministerium-Fast-tausend-Angriffe-auf-Muslime-in-nur-einem-Jahr.html|title=Innenministerium: Fast tausend Angriffe auf Muslime in nur einem Jahr|last=WELT|date=2018-03-03|work=DIE WELT|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 a court in Berlin upheld the right the state's neutrality principle by barring a primary school teacher from wearing a headscarf during classes, where the court spokesman stated that children should be free of the influence that can be exerted by religious symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.dw.com/en/germany-berlin-court-backs-headscarf-ban-for-teacher/a-43723157?xtref=http%253A%252F%252Fm.facebook.com%252F|title=Germany: Berlin court backs headscarf ban for teacher {{!}} DW {{!}} 09.05.2018|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study in 2018 by [[Leipzig University]], 56% of Germans sometimes thought the many Muslims made them [[Social alienation|feel like strangers in their own country]], up from 43% in 2014. In 2018, 44% thought immigration by Muslims should be banned, up from 37% in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/auslaenderfeindlichkeit-muslime-studie-rechtsextremismus-1.4199261|title=Die Deutschen werden immer intoleranter|last=Lipkowski|first=Clara|date=2018-11-07|work=sueddeutsche.de|access-date=2018-11-17|last2=(Grafik)|first2=Markus C.

==Controversies==
As elsewhere [[Islam in Western Europe|in Western Europe]], the rapid growth of the Muslim community in Germany has led to social tensions and political controversy, partly connected to [[Islamic extremism]], and more generally due to the perceived difficulties of [[multiculturalism]] and fears of ''[[Überfremdung]]''. &lt;!-- A [[December 2010]] poll by [[Ifop]], published by the [[French newspapers|French newspaper]] [[Le Monde]] in [[January 2011]], said that 42% of the [[Germans|German]] population regard [[Muslims]] in [[Germany]] as a threat to their [[Nation|national identity]], 75% regard Muslims in [[Germany]] as poorly integrated, 67% blamed the "refusal" by Muslims to integrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifop.com/?option=com_publication&amp;type=poll&amp;id=1365%5D%5Bhttp://www.ifop.com/media/poll/1365-1-study_file.pdf%5D,|title=Ifop - Regard croisé France/Allemagne sur l’Islam|author=|date=|website=www.ifop.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This poll has been widely criticized for not being reliable (less than 1000 people polled altought more than 80 millions people in Germany, poll by Internet without interview, biased questions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observatoire-des-sondages.org/L-ennemi-interieur-a-la-une-Le.html][http://observatoire-des-sondages.org/2012-la-campagne-de-desinformation.html],|title=[http://sites.radiofrance.fr/franceinter/chro/edito/?id=99736], [http://www.arretsurimages.net/vite.php?id=10041], [http://lmsi.net/Pour-100-des-musulmans-les][http://www.oumma.com/Pour-100-des-musulmans-les], [https://twitter.com/CarolineFourest/status/22580789287854080][https://twitter.com/CarolineFourest/status/22581160508923904][http://podcast.rmc.fr/channel30/20110105_bourdin_2.mp3#t=300,660][http://www.lepost.fr/article/2011/01/05/2359937_les-musulmans-pas-integres-dans-la-societe-c-est-un-ressenti-de-l-actualite.html|author=|date=|website=observatoire-des-sondages.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

A 2017 study on Jewish perspectives on [[Antisemitism in Germany#Germany|antisemitism in Germany]] by [[Bielefeld University]] found that individuals and groups belonging to the extreme right and extreme left were equally represented as perpetrators of antisemitic harassment and assault, while the largest part of the attacks were committed by Muslim assailants.

===In the education system===
[[File:Kopftuch im Schuldienst Deutschland.png|thumb|German States that have banned teachers from wearing headscarves (red)]]
One such issue concerns the wearing of the [[hijab|head-scarf]] by teachers in schools and universities. The right to practice one's religion, stated by the teachers in question, contradicts in the view of many the [[Separation of church and state|neutral stance of the state towards religion]]. As of 2006, many of the German federal states have introduced legislation banning head-scarves for teachers. It is almost certain that in 2006 these laws will be validated as constitutional.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

In the German federal states with the exception of [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]], lessons of [[religious education]] overseen by the respective religious communities are taught as an elective subject in state schools. It is being discussed whether apart from the Catholic and Protestant (and in a few schools, Jewish) religious education that currently exists, a comparable subject of Islamic religious education should be introduced as a regular part of the curricula. In several states, trials for Islamic religious education are being conducted, while in the states of Hessen, Lower-Saxony and Northrhine-Westphalia, Islamic religious education already is integrated as a regular class. The problem that the cooperation with Islamic organisations is hampered by the fact that none of them can be considered as representative of the whole Muslim community.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

===Construction of mosques and other projects===
The construction of [[mosque]]s is occasionally resisted by [[Islamophobic|anti Muslim]] reactions in the neighbourhoods concerned. For example, in 2007 an attempt by Muslims to build a large mosque in Cologne sparked a [[Cologne mosque controversy|controversy]].&lt;ref name="georgetown2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/germany |title=Germany |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-29}} See drop-down essay on "Religious Freedom in Germany"&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly with the [[Sendlinger Mosque Controversy]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} and the proposed construction of a training academy in Munich, originally called the "[[Centre for Islam in Europe, Munich]]" (ZIE-M), and later the "Munich Forum for Islam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07MUNICH646_a.html|title=Proposed Bavarian Islamic Academy Highlights Challenges of Muslim Integration|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=3 April 2018|via=WikiLeaks PlusD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic Theological Studies===
In 2010, the German Ministry of Education and Research established Islamic Theological Studies as an academic discipline at public universities in order to train teachers for Islamic religious education and Muslim theologians. Since then, Islamic theological departments have been established at several universities, conducting research and teaching on Islam from a theological perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Felix Engelhardt, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/muwo.12168/full "On Insiderism and Muslim Epistemic Communities in the German and US Study of Islam"], The Muslim World No 4, 2016, p. 740-758&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic fundamentalism{{anchor|Fears_of_Islamic_fundamentalism}}===
Concerns of Islamic fundamentalism came to the fore after [[September 11, 2001]], especially with respect to Islamic fundamentalism among second- and third-generation Muslims in Germany - the [[Hamburg cell]], which included [[Mohamed Atta]], was prominent in the planning and execution of the September 11 attacks. Also the various confrontations between Islamic religious law ([[Sharia]]) and the norms of German ''[[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|Grundgesetz]]'' and culture are the subject of intense debate. German critics include both liberals and Christian groups. The former claim that Islamic fundamentalism violates basic fundamental rights whereas the latter maintain that Germany is a state and society grounded in the Christian tradition.

According to a 2007 [[Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community|Federal Ministry of the Interior]] report almost half of all young Muslims in Germany support fundamentalist views. About 12% of Muslims in Germany identified with moral-religious criticism against Western societal values in combination with [[corporal punishment]] up to and including the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/1.490007|title=Studie des Innenministeriums: „Viele junge Muslime gewaltbereit“|work=FAZ.NET|access-date=2018-11-24|language=de|issn=0174-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 poll, 72% of the [[Turks in Germany]] believe that Islam is the only true religion and 46% wish that one day more Muslims live in Germany than Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Liljeberg Research International: [https://d171.keyingress.de/multimedia/document/228.pdf ''Deutsch-Türkische Lebens und Wertewelten 2012''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011112234/https://d171.keyingress.de/multimedia/document/228.pdf |date=11 October 2012 }}, July/August 2012, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Die Welt]]: [https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article108659406/Tuerkische-Migranten-hoffen-auf-muslimische-Mehrheit.html ''Türkische Migranten hoffen auf muslimische Mehrheit''], 17 August 2012, retrieved 23 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Jewish Press]]: [http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/analysis/in-germany-turkish-muslims-hope-for-more-muslims-than-christians/2012/08/27/ ''In Germany, Turkish Muslims Hope for Muslim Majority''], 27 August 2012, retrieved 27 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 10-year survey by the [[University of Bielefeld]], which dealt with different aspects of attitudes to Islam, "distrust" of Islam is widespread in Germany with only 19 percent of Germans believing that Islam is compatible with German culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/why-germans-distrust-islam/a-16536641 Deutsche Welle: "Why Germans distrust Islam" by Ulrike Hummel] January 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2013 study by [[Social Science Research Center Berlin]], two thirds of the Muslims interviewed say that religious rules are more important to them than the laws of the country in which they live, almost 60 percent of the Muslim respondents reject homosexuals as friends; 45 percent think that Jews cannot be trusted; and an equally large group believes that the West is out to destroy Islam (Christian respondents’ answers for comparison: As many as 9 percent are openly anti-Semitic; 13 percent do not want to have homosexuals as friends; and 23 percent think that Muslims aim to destroy Western culture).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wzb.eu/en/press-release/islamic-fundamentalism-is-widely-spread|title=Islamic fundamentalism is widely spread - WZB|author=|date=|website=www.wzb.eu|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Salafism ===
Salafists strive to live exclusively according to the Quran. According to German authorities, Salafism is incompatible with the principles codified in the Constitution of Germany, in particular democracy, the rule of law and a political order based on human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.verfassungsschutz.bayern.de/islamismus/definition/erscheinungsformen/salafismus/index.html|title=Salafismus|website=www.verfassungsschutz.bayern.de|language=de|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution|German security service]], the Salafist movement attracts rising numbers. In 2011 there were an estimated 3800 Salafists in Germany, which rose to 10300 in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/de/arbeitsfelder/af-islamismus-und-islamistischer-terrorismus/was-ist-islamismus/salafistische-bestrebungen|title=Salafistische Bestrebungen Inhalte und Ziele salafistischer Ideologie|last=|first=|date=|website=BfV|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115163049/http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/de/arbeitsfelder/af-islamismus-und-islamistischer-terrorismus/was-ist-islamismus/salafistische-bestrebungen|archive-date=15 January 2018|dead-url=|access-date=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to head of security office [[Hans-Georg Maaßen]], the Salafist scene in Germany is not dominated by any one single individual, but instead a great many persons have to be monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/gewaltbereite-islamisten-erstmals-mehr-als-10-000-salafisten-in-deutschland_id_6863813.html|title=Gewaltbereite Islamisten: Erstmals mehr als 10.000 Salafisten in Deutschland|last=Online|first=FOCUS|work=FOCUS Online|access-date=2018-07-22|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to German [[Federal Agency for Civic Education]], the salafist movement in Germany is centered in the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main|Frankfurt Rhine-Main metropolitan area]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and Berlin. In these areas mosques and charismatic imams are the driving factors behind recruitment to the salafist movement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bpb.de/politik/extremismus/islamismus/268726/orte-der-islamistischen-radikalisierung|title=Orte der islamistischen Radikalisierung {{!}} bpb|last=Jaschke|first=Hans-Gerd|work=bpb.de|access-date=2018-12-01|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the interior minstry of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] reported that the number of mosques with a salafist influence had risen from 30 to 55, which indicated both an actual increase and improved reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rp-online.de/nrw/panorama/nrw-salafisten-agitieren-in-55-moscheen_aid-18340503|title=Verfassungsschutz: Salafisten agitieren in NRW in 55 Moscheen|last=ONLINE|first=RP|work=RP ONLINE|access-date=2018-11-18|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, salafist mosque organisation ''Berliner Fussilet-Moscheeverein'' was banned by authoritiess. Anas Amri, the perpetrator of the [[2016 Berlin truck attack]] was among its visitors. In March 2017 the community organisation ''Deutschsprachige Islamkreis Hildesheim'' was banned as Muslims were being prepared for travelling to the conflict zone in Syria to fight for the Islamic State. These examples show that salafist mosques not only concern themselves with religious matters, but also serious crime and terrorist activities are prepared.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Islamist scene in Germany===
Turkish and Kurdish Islamist groups are also active in Germany, and Turkish and Kurdish Islamists have co-operated in Germany as in the case of the Sauerland terror cell.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;*German Jihad: On the Internationalisation of Islamist Terrorism by Guido Steinberg. Columbia University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist Guido Steinberg stated that many top leaders of Islamist organizations in Turkey fled to Germany in the 2000s, and that the Turkish (Kurdish) Hizbullah has also "left an imprint on Turkish Kurds in Germany."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Also many Kurds from Iraq (there are about 50,000 to 80,000 Iraqi Kurds in Germany) financially supported Kurdish-Islamist groups like  Ansar al Islam.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Many Islamists in Germany are ethnic Kurds (Iraqi and Turkish Kurds) or Turks. Before 2006, the German Islamist scene was dominated by Iraqi Kurds and Palestinians, but since 2006 Kurds and Turks from Turkey are dominant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2016, the German security service estimated that about 24 000 Muslims were part of Islamists movements in Germany, of which 10 000 belonged to the Salafist scene.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2016, 90 mosques were monitored by the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] for their [[Islamism|islamist ideology]]. These were mostly Arabic-language "backyard mosques" where self-appointed imams exhorted their followers to wage jihad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/islamismus-verdacht-verfassungsschutz-beobachtet-etwa-moscheen-in-deutschland-1.2976423|title=Verfassungsschutz beobachtet etwa 90 Moscheen in Deutschland|date=2016|work=sueddeutsche.de|access-date=2018-11-18|language=de|issn=0174-4917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the start of 2017 until April 2018, 80 islamist extremists without German citizenship were deported to their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article176069850/Justiz-Top-Gefaehrder-aus-Hessen-abgeschoben.html|title=Justiz: Top-Gefährder aus Hessen abgeschoben|last=Flade|first=Florian|date=2018-05-04|work=DIE WELT|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, there were 760 islamists in Germany classified as dangerous by [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|police authorities]], of which more than half were on German territory and 153 of the latter were in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/de/bundeskriminalamt-z%C3%A4hlt-760-islamistische-gef%C3%A4hrder/a-43203952|title=Bundeskriminalamt zählt 760 islamistische Gefährder {{!}} DW {{!}} 31.03.2018|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=de|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banning of IHH Germany===
In July 2010, Germany outlawed the [[Internationale Humanitäre Hilfsorganisation e.V.]] (IHH Germany), saying it had used donations to support [[Hamas]], which is considered by the European Union and Germany to be a terrorist organization,&lt;ref name="Hilfsorganisation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3918670,00.html|title=Germany bans group accused of Hamas links|author=|date=7 December 2010|website=ynetnews.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IHH"/&gt; while presenting their activities to donors as humanitarian help. German Interior Minister [[Thomas de Maiziere]] said, "[[Donations]] to so-called social welfare groups belonging to Hamas, such as the millions given by IHH, actually support the terror organization Hamas as a whole."&lt;ref name="Hilfsorganisation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IHH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/germany-outlaws-ihh-over-claimed-hamas-links-1.301483|title=Germany Outlaws Charity Over Alleged Hamas Links|first=|last=DPA|date=12 July 2010|publisher=|accessdate=3 April 2018|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; IHH e.V. was believed by the German Authorities to have collected money in mosques and to have sent $8.3 million to organizations related to Hamas.&lt;ref name="Zaman"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Germany IHH e.V. ban shameful, illegal, says group leader|work=Today's Zaman|date=14 July 2010|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=215989}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religiosity of young Muslims ==
Studies show that while not all Muslims are religious, Muslim youths are markedly more religious than non-Muslim youths. A study comparing Turkish Muslim youths living in Germany and German youth found that the former were more likely to attend religious services regularly (35% versus 14%).&lt;ref name="Gesemann2"&gt;Frank Gesemann. "Die Integration junger Muslime in Deutschland. Interkultureller Dialog - Islam und Gesellschaft Nr. 5 (year of 2006). Friedrich Ebert Stiftung", on p. 9 - the document is written in German&lt;/ref&gt;

41% of young Turkish Muslim boys and 52% of the girls said they prayed "sometimes or regularly"; 64% of boys and 74% of girls said they wanted to teach their children religion.&lt;ref name="Gesemann2"/&gt;

According to a 2012 poll, 25% of the [[Turks in Germany]] believe atheists are inferior human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Liljeberg Research International: [https://d171.keyingress.de/multimedia/document/228.pdf ''Deutsch-Türkische Lebens und Wertewelten 2012''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011112234/https://d171.keyingress.de/multimedia/document/228.pdf |date=11 October 2012 }}, July/August 2012, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Die Welt]]: [https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article108659406/Tuerkische-Migranten-hoffen-auf-muslimische-Mehrheit.html ''Türkische Migranten hoffen auf muslimische Mehrheit''], 17 August 2012, retrieved 23 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jainism]], '''Jinvani''' means the message or the teachings of the Jina (''arihant'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Universal Message of Jainism|date=1998|p=xi-xii|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2FQvAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merinews.com/mobile/article/India/2015/05/19/jaipur-gets-ready-for-shrut-panchami-mahaparva/15906541|title=Jaipur gets ready for Shrut Panchami Mahaparva - merinews Mobile|work=merinews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jainsamaj.org/rpg_site/literature2.php?id=686&amp;cat=42|title=on www.jainsamaj.org ( Jainism, Ahimsa News, Religion, Non-Violence, Culture, Vegetarianism, Meditation, India. )|work=jainsamaj.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made up of two words ''Jina'' ([[Arihant (Jainism)|arihant]]) and ''Vani'' (voice).

[[File:Mezquita de Córdoba desde el aire (Córdoba, España).jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba]], one of the best preserved old mosques in Spain.]]
This is a '''list of former mosques in Spain'''.  It lists former [[Muslim]] [[mosques]] ([[Arabic]]: Masjid, [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: Mezquita) and [[Islamic]] places of worship in [[Spain]]. It lists some but by no means all of the old mosques of Spain. For open, functioning mosques please see [[list of mosques in Spain]]. 

The term '''former mosque''' in this list includes any [[Muslim]] [[mosque]] (building) or site used for Islamic Prayer ([[Salah]]) in [[Spain]] but is not so any longer.  

Most of the former mosques in Spain were built and used as Muslim places of worship during the [[Al-Andalus]] (Muslim Spain) period from 711 AD to 1492 AD when various Muslim [[Moors|Moorish]] kingdoms ruled large parts of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Most of these former mosques and religious buildings were either demolished or converted into churches after the Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula (the [[Reconquista]]).&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;{{cite web |title=5 Most Impressive Historic Mosques in Spain |url=http://historylists.org/architecture/5-most-impressive-historic-mosques-in-spain.html |website=historylists.org |accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list does not include the [[List of former mosques in Portugal|former mosques of Portugal]] that were built during [[Al-Andalus|Al-andalus]] era.

==History==
[[Mosques]] were an integral part of Spanish social, political and cultural spheres during the Muslim rule of Spain (711 - 1492 AD). Subsequently they played an important role in Spanish history for over eight centuries. However, with the exception of the [[Great Mosque of Cordoba]], there is very little documentation or published information available in English language about these old historical mosques of Spain.

There are only estimates about the number of former Spanish mosques. However there seem to have existed several hundreds and possibly even thousands of mosques in Spain. According to one estimate, there were 3,000 mosques, bath and palaces in [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] city alone. This was during the 10th century, when Cordoba was one of the largest cities in the world and had over 250,0000 buildings spread across a area of twenty four miles long and six miles wide. Today these old mosques in Cordoba are lost without a trace with the exception of the [[Great Mosque of Cordoba]] and few other ruins and remains like ''Minaret of San Juan''.&lt;ref name="b1"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Great Mosque of Cordoba: Geometric Analysis |url=http://islamic-arts.org/2011/the-great-mosque-of-cordoba-geometric-analysis/ |website=islamic-arts.org |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At onetime there were 137 mosques in the Medina of [[Granada|Grenada]] when it was the capital city of the [[Emirate of Granada]] (1230-1492).&lt;ref name="b2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Minaret of San Juan De Los Reyes and Mosque of The Conversos |url=http://legadonazari.blogspot.com/2014/06/alminar-de-san-juan-de-los-reyes-y.html |website=legadonazari.blogspot.com |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the Medina (city) of Granada was one of the largest cities in Europe and accepted large number of Muslim refugees expelled from the Christian controlled areas. This doubled its size, and by 1450 made it the largest city in Europe in terms of population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimheritage.com/uploads/Granada.pdf Granada- The Last Refuge of Muslims in Spain] by Salah Zaimeche&lt;/ref&gt; 

Proliferation of mosques was not limited to the large cities. Even small cities and towns had multiple mosques built for the easy and quick access of the faithful to perform their daily five times Islamic prayers ([[Salah]]) in congregation. There were 18 mosques in [[Jerez, Spain|Jerez]] city, of which only the mosque within the fortress of [[Alcazar of Jerez de la Frontera]] survives today.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There were 16 mosques in [[Vélez-Málaga]] (then known as Ballis Medina) during the Nazari [[Emirate of Granada|Granada Emirate]] period.&lt;ref name="b3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mosque of Velez Malaga |url=http://legadonazari.blogspot.com/2013/07/mezquita-de-velez-malaga.html |website=legadonazari.blogspot.com |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronda, Spain|Ronda]] a smaller town had 7 or 8 mosques of which none exist today except a minaret tower of a medium-size mosque.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; About 5 former mosques still exists in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] with the original structures at-least partially preserved as shown in the list below.

|After [[Muslim conquest of Spain]] (710~), the site of former main [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] church of Cordoba was divided and shared between Muslims and Christians for seven decades.

After Christians captured Cordoba in 1236, King Ferdinand III of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] converted the mosque into a cathedral. Later, a cathedral was built at the center of the old mosque, configuring the current Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba. It was the second largest mosque in the world after Mecca Great mosque from the around 9th century, until [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]], [[Istanbul]] was built in 1588. It had a surface area of {{convert|23,400|m2|ha|lk=in}} and accommodated an estimated 32,000 to 40,000 worshipers. Current mosque structure date from 784 to 987.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of former mosques in Spain (with original buildings destroyed)==
This table lists former mosques in Spain with ''no known'' surviving mosque buildings. The original mosques were completely destroyed by people, war or by natural causes like earthquakes. Other structures were built on the site destroying or covering traces of the mosque. The ruins and stone materials of the mosque were often reused to build the new structures. However these sites may still contain undiscovered original structures within the current buildings or un-excavated ruins on the premises.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1617">The '''luang pho phet''' ({{lang-th|หลวงพ่อเพชร}}) is a type of image of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] found in [[Thailand]].  A luang pho phet depicts the Buddha in the ''Diamond [[Lotus Position]].''

==Notable luang pho phet images==
[[File:Luang Pho Phet (Wat Tha Thanon).jpg|thumb|Luang pho phet at Wat Tha Thanon]]
Notable luang pho phet Buddha images include the luang pho phet of [[Uttaradit]] (in Wat Tha Thanon), the luang pho phet of [[Phichit]] (in Wat Tha Luang), and the luang pho phet of [[Nakhon Thai Subdistrict|Nakhon Thai]] (in Wat Na Phra That).  The luang pho phet in Uttaradit is believed to have been constructed between 800 and 900 years ago.&lt;ref name="Chimburi.com"&gt;[http://www.chimburi.com/thai485.htm Wat Tha Thanon temple on Chimburi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==luang pho phet in prayer==

An English translation of a common Pali chant to be said before a luang pho phet image is as follows:&lt;ref name="Wat Pradhātu"&gt;See, e.g., [http://vipassanasangha.free.fr/ChantingBook.pdf Chanting Book of Wat Pradhātu Srī Chomtong Voravihāra]&lt;/ref&gt;
:By body, by speech, and by mind, I will always revere the image named luang pho phet,
:the Buddha statue, working wonders of psychic power.  May I be blessed forevermore.

The text of the chant in Pali is as follows:
:Kāyena vācāya va cetassa vā vajiraü nāma pañimaü iddhi-pāñihāriyakaraü buddha-rūpaü ahaü vandāmi sabbaso; sadā sotthī bhavantu me.

'''''Magic: History, Theory and Practice''''' is a [[Mysticism|mysticism book]] by [[Ernst Schertel]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Magic: History, Theory, Practice|last=Schertel|first=Ernst|publisher=Catalog of the Universal Mind|year=2009|isbn=978-0578024578|location=Boise, Idaho|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally published in Germany in 1923, ''Magic: History / Theory / Practice'' (in its original German edition), was a hardcover book consisting of 154 pages.

Schertel identifies heavily with the "demonic" in ''Magic'', espousing the belief that "communion with the demon" is the most important aspect of magical/religious practice. In addition to this, Schertel also identified the following elements of magic:  

# Ecstasy. The performer must enter an altered mind state of “ecstasy”, “possession” or “somnambulism”, and it is usually achieved by dancing, chanting, hypnosis, intoxication, and even sacrifices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He wrote in the book, “Originally, prophecy meant just “speaking while being delighted with god,” and this already shows that for this kind of magic the amalgamation with the demon, that is to say an ecstasy (trance) was seen as a precondition as much as with every other kind of magic.”Some modern authors believe that it is equivalent to the [[Alpha wave|alpha]] state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Code of the Extraordinary Mind: 10 Unconventional Laws to Redefine Your Life and Succeed On Your Own Terms|last=Lakhiani|first=Vishen|publisher=Rodale Books|year=10 May 2016|isbn=978-1623367084|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Imagination. It is the way through which the performer bring the desired changes into reality. Schertel wrote, “The man with the greatest force of imagination is commanding of the world and creates realities according to his will, instead of being the slave of an unsubstantial, bodiless empiricism.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He thinks that magic is autogenic exertion of power on the basis of imagination, and reality is nothing more than the becoming-an-image of our deepest essential powers, and thus the observation of truth is not a process of “depiction” but of “construction”.
#Body-feeling. The performer is required to develop a kind of “body feeling” through “body exercises”. However, here Schertel is not referring to common muscle-building or physical training nowadays. The two forms of exercises that he recommends are “senual” and “articular”. “The sensual practices stand for a passive listening-into the body and are therefore preferably happening out of a state of relaxation, the articular practices on the other hand represent a violent, almost mechanical pushing and bending of individual joints or of the whole body... These practices are supported by certain breathing methods.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also points out that to increase body feeling, many magicians often perform with loose clothes or even naked.

In 2003 it was revealed that Schertel had sent a dedicated copy of the book to [[Adolf Hitler]].  Hitler read the book and marked several passages.&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, Timothy. [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200305/ryback ''Hitler's Forgotten Library'']. ''[[The Atlantic]]'', May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of sixty-six annotations were made by Hitler in his copy. Eventually the Hitler copy was obtained from the [[John Hay Library]] at [[Brown University]] and the book was translated into English with his annotations added.

Some of the passages marked by Hitler include:
* “False images are necessary for the recognition of truth.”
* “He who does not have the demonic seed within himself will never give birth to a magical world.”
* “Satan is the beginning…”&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, JH. [http://www.prlog.org/10238075-new-translation-of-german-book-links-hitler-to-satanism.html "New Translation of German Book Links Hitler to Satanism"] (press release). PRLog, May 17, 2009. Accessed 28 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Max Stern Art Restitution Project''' was initiated as an effort to locate artworks lost by Dr. [[Max Stern (gallery owner)|Max Stern]] during [[World War II]].

==Background information==
Max Stern was a world-renowned art collector and gallery owner who died in 1987. During World War II, Stern was forced to flee the [[Nazi regime]] and relocate to [[Canada]]. While escaping, he lost his private collection of valued artworks through forced sale and confiscation. After the war, Stern sought [[restitution]] of these works. Unfortunately, he had limited success and only managed to recover several pieces. The majority of his property was never returned.

==The project==
The Max Stern Art Restitution Project was established by the executors and university beneficiaries of the Max Stern Estate. An official announcement outlining the initiation of the project and its goals was made on April 28, 2005. This announcement occurred in [[Quebec]], and was given by Dr. Clarence Epstein of [[Concordia University]].&lt;ref name="Concordia Article"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lecavalier|first=Catherine|title=Concordia Commits to Seeking Restitution of Max Stern's Art Holdings Lost During the Nazi Regime|url=https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/concordia/docs/max-stern/Concordia-Commits-to-Seeking-Restitution.pdf|publisher=Concordia University|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is seeking the [[restitution]] of art pieces originally owned by the late Max Stern. These pieces were either confiscated by the [[Nazi Party]], or sold under duress in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Concordia Article" /&gt; While project members realize that locating missing artwork is a great challenge, they decided that the moral and financial imperatives surrounding the cause make it worth the effort.

[[Concordia University]] has been a leader in the restitution movement, and is working closely with the Art Loss Register in London, the Commission of Looted Art in Europe, and the New York State Holocaust Claims Processing Office. Since Concordia launched its efforts, 250 artworks previously owned by Stern have been identified. These include pieces by [[Jan Brueghel the Younger|Brueghel]], [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]], [[Ludovico Carracci|Carracci]] and [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter|Winterhalter]]. Five works have been located in the [[United States]], [[England]], the [[Netherlands]] or [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="Concordia Article" /&gt;  As artworks are reclaimed and possession is acquired, estate executors plan to loan the pieces to museums and galleries. This decision was made based on Max Stern's ideals, as he was always encouraging art education and passion in [[Canada]] and around the world. Executors and beneficiaries have expressed their wish to avoid using the courts, and instead wish to utilize moral persuasion in convincing institutions and individuals to return works to the appropriate beneficiaries.&lt;ref name="Concordia Article" /&gt;

The Max Stern Art Restitution Project was not initiated only to find missing works. Rather, it was also created as an incentive to motivate governments, museums, collectors and the art trade towards resolving injustices caused by Nazi cultural policies. In order to commence this movement, the restitution project chose to spearhead the ''Auktion 392 ''exhibit.

==''Auktion 392''==
Launched in fall of 2006, ''Auktion 392 ''is a traveling exhibit surrounding the forced sale of Stern paintings in the Lempertz auction house during 1937. This exhibit was created by FOFA gallery coordinator Lynn Beavis and designer Andrew Elvish. It also accompanies the seminal research of Professor Catherine MacKenzie and MA students from Concordia's Department of Art History.&lt;ref name="Auktion Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|last=Uri|first=Ben|title=AUKTION 392 Reclaiming the Galerie Stern, Düsseldorf|url=https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/concordia/docs/max-stern/benUri_press.pdf|publisher=London Jewish Museum of Art|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition outlines the unique story of Max Stern, and the legal issues of art restitution stemming from [[anti-Semitic]] policies during [[World War II]]. There is historical meaning behind the name of this exhibit. In 1935, after Stern had his art trading license withdrawn, he was forced to sell his artworks under extreme duress. The sale was arranged by Lempertz auctioneers in [[Cologne]], and the auction was titled Auktion 392.&lt;ref name="Auktion book"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacKenzie|first=Catherine|title=Auktion 392: Reclaiming the Galerie Stern, Dusseldorf|year=2006|publisher=Concordia University|location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exhibit is extremely valuable to the Max Stern Art Restitution Project, as it raises public awareness of art restitution matters.

==Issues in restitution==
Recovering the missing artwork has been no simple task. There have been several instances where pieces have been located, but a lack of cooperation keeps the works from being acquired. Take, for example, the issue surrounding two artworks originally sold under duress by Stern. The two paintings, ''Market Scene in the Piazza Navona ''and ''Market Scene in the Piazza del Quirinale'', were created by a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Baroque painter]] named Mathijs Naiveu. These paintings were discovered while being auctioned in the Van Ham auction house, which is located in [[Cologne]].&lt;ref name="Second Website Concordia"&gt;{{cite web|last=Churchmuch|first=Tanya|title=German auction house to proceed with sale of Nazi- tainted art despite objections|url=https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/concordia/docs/max-stern/german-auction-house-to-proceed.pdf|publisher=Concordia University|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, 2006, it was requested that the artworks be removed from the upcoming auction. The Stern Estate had been pursuing the paintings for several years, ever since the possessor tried to sell them in [[Amsterdam]]. Unfortunately, the German possessor refused to acknowledge the forced sale that took place during the [[Nazi era]]. Consequently, the Van Ham sale was scheduled to proceed despite the tainted history.&lt;ref name="Second Website Concordia"/&gt;

In order to be reclaimed, each discovered artwork has to run through a legal process which varies depending on its located country. Some pieces present extreme challenges, like the [[Nicolas Neufchatel|Neufchatel]] portrait of Jan van Eversdijck. Upon discovery, this portrait was deemed part of the patrimony of the Illes Beleares province in [[Spain]]. This patrimony made difficult for project members to claim their right of ownership. Fortunately, the painting has since been restituted and is one of the 11 paintings reclaimed by the Max Stern Art Restitution Project. This particular portrait was easy to locate because it was posted on a museum website up until 2006.&lt;ref name="Auktion book" /&gt; Other paintings are much more difficult to find. This difficulty stems from the fact that a large number of Stern's stock was not illustrated, and few of the given titles were likely to have remained over the years. Unfortunately, art galleries and auction houses are not required to provide background information on works of art in their possession. Dealers will often be in possession of the full story behind a specific painting, but choose to suppress this information for business reasons.&lt;ref name="Auktion book" /&gt;

Research conducted has learned that upwards of forty paintings originally owned by Stern have since been re-offered on the market in the last two decades, usually through major auction houses in [[Germany]]. The Stern Estate continues to plead with [[Germany|German]] auction houses, hoping to make them recognize the validity of the estate's ownership regarding looted artworks.&lt;ref name="Third article"&gt;{{cite web|last=Downey|first=Fiona|title=German Auction House refuses to withdraw painting claimed by Stern Estate|url=https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/concordia/docs/max-stern/german-auction-house.pdf|publisher=Concordia University|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Citation style|date=January 2010}}

'''Micrography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]], literally small-writing – "Μικρογραφία"), also called '''microcalligraphy''', is a [[Jew]]ish form of [[calligram]]s developed in the 9th century, with parallels in Christianity and Islam,&lt;ref&gt;[http://expositions.bnf.fr/parole/grand/134.htm Torah, Bible, Coran] (French)&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing minute [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] to form representational, geometric and abstract designs. Colored micrography is especially distinctive because these rare artworks are customarily rendered in black and white.

== Description ==
The artwork is created from text that forms an image when viewed at a distance, creating an interplay between the text and image. The [[photomosaic]], whose tiny individual images form a mosaic when viewed from a distance, is a modern analogue.

== Motivation ==
{{see also|Calligram}}
[[File:Caligrafia arabe pajaro.jpg|thumb|An Arabic [[calligram]] in the form of a peacock.]]
There is a relationship between this form of art, employing both digital and analogic symbols, and the restrictions on images found in the [[Ten commandments#Traditional division and interpretation|second commandment]]. Micrography provides a unique solution to the visual artist who wishes to remain devout in observation of [[Jewish law]], by using only text, not images per se. As similar restrictions exist in certain [[Islam|Muslim]] societies, this solution has been adapted in [[Islamic calligraphy]] to the [[Arabic alphabet]] as well.

'''Mitchell David Kapor''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-Mitch Kapor.ogg|'|k|eɪ|p|ɔːr|}} {{respell|KAY|por}}; born November 1, 1950&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kapor.com/bio/ | title=Mitchell Kapor: Biography |
 publisher=Kapor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.computerhope.com/people/mitchell_kapor.htm | title=Mitchell Kapor}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American entrepreneur best known for his work as an application developer in the early days of the personal computer software industry, later founding [[Lotus Software|Lotus]], where he was instrumental in developing the [[Lotus 1-2-3]] spreadsheet. He left Lotus in 1986. In 1990 with [[John Perry Barlow]] and [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], he co-founded the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and served as its chairman until 1994. In 2003, Kapor became the founding chair of the [[Mozilla Foundation]], creator of the open source web browser [[Firefox]]. Kapor has been an investor in the personal computing industry, and supporter of social causes via Kapor Capital&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kaporcapital.com/ Kapor Capital]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Kapor Center.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kaporcenter.org/ Kapor Center]&lt;/ref&gt; Kapor and his wife, [[Freada Kapor Klein]], invest in social impact tech startups that seek to narrow gaps in opportunity and access for underrepresented communities and attempt to eliminate barriers to full participation across the tech ecosystem. Kapor and Klein take a comprehensive approach to removing barriers in education and the workplace for all and fixing the leaks at every stage of the tech pipeline. Kapor serves on the board of SMASH,&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.smashprogram.org/ SMASH]&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit founded by Klein to help underrepresented scholars hone their [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] knowledge while building the networks and skills for careers in tech and the sciences.&lt;ref name=diversify&gt;{{cite news | title=Oakland’s Kapors spend $40 million to help diversify tech world | url=https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Oakland-s-Kapors-spend-40-million-to-help-6422693.php | first=Joe | last=Garofoli | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=power&gt;{{cite news | title=Tech power couple Mitch Kapor and Freada Kapor Klein give $40 million to make tech industry more diverse | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2015/08/mitch-kapor-freada-tech-diversity-philanthropy-40m.html | first=Jahna | last=Berry | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=power/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Mitchell Kapor seeks to meld business, social good | url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Mitchell-Kapor-seeks-to-meld-business-social-good-4759003.php | first=Caleb | last=Garling | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Kapor was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last= Wall |first=Alix  |authorlink=   |title= Meet the Oakland philanthropists trying to diversify the tech world |publisher=[[J. The Jewish News of Northern California]]|date=November 2, 2017 |url=https://www.jweekly.com/2017/11/02/meet-oakland-philanthropists-trying-diversify-tech-world/  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Brooklyn, New York]], and raised in [[Freeport, New York]] on Long Island, where he graduated from high school in 1967.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;  He received a B.A. from [[Yale College]] in 1971 and studied psychology, linguistics, and computer science in an interdisciplinary major, also attending the Boston-based Beacon College, which had a satellite campus in Washington, D.C. at the time. He began but did not complete a master's degree at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] but later served on the faculty of the [[MIT Media Lab]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley School of Information]].

==Career==
===Lotus===
Lotus was founded in 1982 by partners Mitch Kapor and [[Jonathan Sachs]] with backing from [[Benjamin M. Rosen|Ben Rosen]]. Lotus' first product was presentation software for the [[Apple II]] known as Lotus Executive Briefing System. Kapor founded Lotus after leaving his post as head of development at [[VisiCorp]], the distributors of the [[Visicalc]] [[spreadsheet]], and selling all his rights to VisiPlot and VisiTrend to VisiCorp.

Shortly after Kapor left Visi-Corp, he and Sachs produced an integrated spreadsheet and graphics program. Even though IBM and VisiCorp had a collaboration agreement whereby Visi-Calc was being shipped simultaneously with the PC, Lotus had a clearly superior product. Lotus released [[Lotus 1-2-3]] on January 26, 1983. The name referred to the three ways the product could be used, as a spreadsheet, graphics package, and [[database manager]]. In practice the latter two functions were less often used, but 1-2-3 was the most powerful spreadsheet program available.

Lotus was almost immediately successful, becoming the world's third largest microcomputer software company in 1983 with $53 million in sales in its first year,&lt;ref name="caruso 19840402"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kC4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Company Strategies Boomerang | work=InfoWorld | date=1984-04-02 | last=Caruso | first=Denise | pages=80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to its business plan forecast of $1 million in sales. Jerome Want says:
:Under founder and CEO Mitch Kapor, Lotus was a company with few rules and fewer internal bureaucratic barriers.... Kapor decided that he was no longer suited to running a company, and [in 1986] he replaced himself with [[Jim Manzi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerome H. Want|title=Corporate Culture: Illuminating the Black Hole|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWrelIr4pWsC&amp;pg=PA55|year=2007|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital rights activism===
Kapor was extensively involved in initiatives that created the modern Internet. He co-founded the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] in 1990 and served as its chairman until 1994. EFF defends civil liberties in the digital world and works to ensure that rights and freedoms are enhanced and protected as our use of technology grows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Where Is the Digital Highway Really Heading? | url=https://www.wired.com/1993/03/kapor-on-nii/ | work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date=March 1, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Mitch Kapor: Civilizing Cyberspace | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/civilizing-cyberspace-19930610 | first=Jeff | last=Goodall | work=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=June 10, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Defending liberties in high-tech world | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13718446/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/defending-liberties-high-tech-world/ | first=ANICK | last=JESDANUN | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[MSNBC]] | date=July 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Mitch Kapor Backs Open Source Software For Simplifying Internet TV | url=https://www.informationweek.com/mitch-kapor-backs-open-source-software-for-simplifying-internet-tv/d/d-id/1035796 | first=Antone | last=Gonsalves | work=[[InformationWeek]] | date=September 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kapor attended the first [[Wikimania]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="thewikipediarevolution8"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Lih | first1=Andrew | authorlink=Andrew Lih | title=[[The Wikipedia Revolution: How a Bunch of Nobodies Created the World's Greatest Encyclopedia]] | date=2009 | publisher=Aurum | location=London | isbn=9781845134730 | oclc=280430641 | page=8 | quote=Mitch Kapor, founder of Lotus Development Corporation, made the trip on his own time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investments===
Kapor was the founding investor in [[UUNET]], one of the first and the largest early Internet service provider; of [[RealNetworks|Real Networks]], the Internet’s first streaming media company; and of [[Linden Lab]], maker of the first successful virtual world, [[Second Life]]. He was also founding chair of the [[Commercial Internet eXchange]] (CIX).

In 2003, Kapor became the founding chair of the [[Mozilla Foundation]], creator of the open source web browser [[Firefox]].

Kapor serves on the advisory board of the [[Sunlight Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://sunlightfoundation.com/about/board/  | title=Board and Advisory Board | publisher=[[Sunlight Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, after founder [[Susan P. Crawford]] had joined the Obama administration, Kapor took over chairmanship of [[OneWebDay]] - the "Earth Day for the internet". In 1996, the [[Computer History Museum]] named him a Museum Fellow "for his development of Lotus 1-2-3, the first major software application for the IBM PC."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mitch Kapor 1996 Fellow | url=http://www.computerhistory.org/fellowawards/hall/mitch-kapor/ | publisher=[[Computer History Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the Mitchell Kapor Foundation to support his philanthropic interests in environmental health.

As an active [[angel investor]], Kapor participated in the initial rounds of [[Dropcam]], [[Twilio]], [[Asana (software)|Asana]], Cleanify, and [[Uber]].

===Kapor Center and Kapor Capital===
Kapor founded the Kapor Center in 2000 as an institution focused on tech inclusion and social impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mitchell Kapor Foundation | url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/94-3330604 | publisher=GuideStar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution's mission is to invest in social and financial capital in vital non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Kapors pledge $40 million investment in tech diversity | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/08/04/mitch-kapor-freada-kapor-klein-tech-diversity-40-million-investment-pledge-white-house-demo-day/31069481/ | work=[[USA TODAY]] | date=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As part of the Kapor Center, Kapor Capital is its venture capital arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Company Overview of Kapor Capital | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=112164205 | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The venture capital firm has been investing since 2009, including early angel round investments in Uber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Kapor Capital - Investments | url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kapor-capital/investments/investments_list | publisher=[[TechCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, Kapor Capital has made over 160 investments, primarily in information technology seed stage startups, with a particular focus on diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Who We Are - Kapor Capital | url=http://www.kaporcapital.com/who-we-are/ | website=Kapor Capital}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2016, the Kapor Center for Social Impact, Kapor Capital, and [http://www.smashprogram.org/ SMASH] have been located in the Uptown neighborhood of Oakland, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Kapor Center seeks to diversify tech while promoting Oakland Uptown Neighborhood | url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/kapor-center-seeks-to-diversify-tech-while-promoting-oakland-uptown-neighborhood | website=Fox 2 KTVU | date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversity in technology===
In August 2015, Mitch and Freada announced they would invest $40 million over three years to accelerate their work to make the tech ecosystem more inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/08/04/mitch-kapor-freada-kapor-klein-tech-diversity-40-million-investment-pledge-white-house-demo-day/31069481/ | title=Kapors pledge $40 million investment in tech diversity | first=Jessica | last=Guynn | work=[[USA TODAY]] | date=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=diversify/&gt;&lt;ref name=power/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=40 Diverse People In Tech Who Made Big Moves In 2015 | url=https://techcrunch.com/gallery/40-diverse-people-in-tech-2015/slide/16/ | publisher=[[TechCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his roles at Kapor Capital and Kapor Center, Mitch currently serves on the Board of [http://www.smashprogram.org/ SMASH], whose mission is to enhance equal opportunity in education and the workplace, and sits on the Advisory Board of Generation Investment Management, a firm whose vision is to embed sustainability into the mainstream capital markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Let's Celebrate 2015 as a Year of Progress in Tech Inclusion | url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/12/29/_2015_was_a_year_of_progress_in_tech_inclusion.html | first=Brooke | last=Hunter | work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=December 29, 2015 | issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The (Planet-Saving, Capitalism-Subverting, Surprisingly Lucrative) Investment Secrets of Al Gore | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/11/the-planet-saving-capitalism-subverting-surprisingly-lucrative-investment-secrets-of-al-gore/407857/ | first=JAMES | last=FALLOWS | work=[[The Atlantic]] | date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rama Navami''' ([[Devanagari]]: राम नवमी; [[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|Rāma navamī}}'') is a spring [[Hindu]] festival that celebrates the birthday of god [[Rama]].
He is particularly important to the [[Vaishnavism]] tradition of Hinduism, as the seventh [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=175953 The nine-day festival of Navratri leading up to Sri Rama Navami has bhajans, kirtans and discourses in store for devotees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407143924/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=175953 |date= 7 April 2009 }} ''[[Indian Express]]'', Friday , 31 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is a part of the spring [[Navratri]], and falls on the ninth day of the bright half ([[Paksha|Shukla Paksha]]) in the Hindu calendar month of [[Chaitra]]. This typically occurs in the Gregorian months of March or April every year.&lt;ref name=lochetefeld562&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

The day is marked by Rama Katha recitals, or reading of Rama stories. [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharat]] are considered [[Itihasa]] by Indian traditions.

==Significance==
The festival celebrates the descent of god [[Vishnu]] as Rama avatar, through his birth to King [[Dasharatha]] and Queen [[Kausalya]] in [[Ayodhya]].&lt;ref name=dna8apr2014/&gt;

== Celebrations ==
[[File:Rama Navami 17.jpg|thumb|left|Baby Rama in a cradle at [[Chinawal|Chinawal village]] temple, Maharashtra]]
The day is the ninth and last day of ''Chaitra Navaratri'' (not to be confused with the autumn [[Navratri]]).&lt;ref name=lochetefeld562/&gt; It celebrates the arrival of Vishnu's 7th avatar, god Rama. It is marked by the faithfuls with ''puja'' (devotional worship) such as bhajan and kirtan, by fasting and reading passages about Rama's life. Special cities in the ''[[Ramayana]]'' legends about Rama's life observe major celebrations.&lt;ref name=lochetefeld562/&gt; These include Ayodhya (Uttar Pradesh), Rameshwaram (Tamil Nadu), [[Bhadrachalam]] ([[Telangana]]) and Sitamarhi (Bihar). Some locations organize Rath-yatras (chariot processions), while some celebrate it as the wedding anniversary festival (''Kalyanotsavam'') of Rama and Sita.&lt;ref name=dna8apr2014/&gt;

The Uttaradhi Math and the Mantralaya Raghavender Swamy math worships the Moola Rama idols at their respective Maths on this day  which also marks the aradhana of Kavibdrateertharu. [[Uttaradi Matha]]￼

While the festival is named after Rama, the festival typically includes reverence for Sita, Lakshmana and Hanumana given their importance in Rama's story.&lt;ref name="Rosen2006p212"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Rosen|title=Essential Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WuVG8PxKq_0C&amp;pg=PA212 |year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99006-0|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Vaishnava Hindus observe the festival in [[Hindu temple]]s, some observe it within their homes.&lt;ref name="Melton2011p739"&gt;{{cite book|author=Constance A Jones|editor=J.

In Karnataka, Sri Ramanavami is celebrated by the local Mandali’s (organizations) at some places even on footpaths, dispersing free panaka (jaggery and crushed muskmelon juice) and some food. Additionally, in Bengaluru, Karnataka, the [[Sree Ramaseva Mandali]], R.C.T (R.) Chamrajpet, organizes India’s most prestigious, month long classical music festival. The uniqueness of this 80 years old musical extravaganza is that celebrated Indian classical musicians, irrespective of their religion, from both genres – Carnatic and Hindustani – descend down to offer their musical rendition to Lord Sri Rama and the assembled audience.&lt;ref&gt; [name = http://www.ramanavami.org/about-us/] &lt;/ref&gt; Every year over 2 lakh people attend the 31 days event supported by Government and organisations such as Infosys Foundation.

[[File:A View of Bhadrachalam Gopuram.JPG|thumb|Bhadrachalam temple in [[Telangana]] is one of the major Rama Navami celebration sites.&lt;ref name=dna8apr2014/&gt;]]
In eastern Indian states such as Odisha, Jharkhand, and West Bengal, the Jagannath temples and regional Vaishnava community observe Rama Navami, and treat it as the day when preparations begin for their annual Jagannath [[Ratha Yatra]] in summer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://odishasuntimes.com/2016/01/24/logs-for-trinitys-chariots-arrive-in-odishas-puri-town/ Logs for Trinity’s chariots arrive in Odisha’s Puri town], Odisha Sun Times (24 January 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehitavada.com/Encyc/2016/4/15/All-set-for-grand-Ram-Navami-Shobhayatra.aspx All set for grand Ram Navami Shobhayatra], The Hitavada (15 Apr 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Devotees associated with [[ISKCON]] fast through the daylight hours.&lt;ref name="Melton2011p739"/&gt; A number of ISKCON temples introduced a more prominent celebration of the occasion of the holiday with the view of addressing needs of growing native [[Hindu]] congregation. It is however always was a notable calendar event on the traditional [[Gaurabda]] calendar with a specific additional requirement of fasting by devotees.&lt;ref name=Zaidman2000&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zaidman, N. | year = 2000 | title = The Integration of Indian Immigrants to Temples Run by North Americans | journal = Social Compass | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 205 | url = http://scp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/47/2/205  | accessdate = 1 June 2008 |quote=Another example of a religious enterprise initiated by a board member was the organization of Lord Ramachandra Appearance Day (Sri Ram Navami). | doi = 10.1177/003776800047002005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside India==
Rama Navami is one of the Hindu festivals that is celebrated by the Indian Hindu diaspora with roots in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Andhra pradesh and Tamilnadu. The descendants of Indian [[indentured servants]], for example, who arrived in colonial [[South Africa]] before 1910 to work in British owned plantations and mines, thereafter lived through the South African [[Apartheid]] regime, continued to celebrate Ram Navami by reciting ''[[Ramayana]]'', and by singing [[bhajan]]s of [[Tyagaraja]] and [[Kancherla Gopanna|Bhadrachala Ramdas]]. The tradition continues in contemporary times in the Hindu temples of [[Durban]] every year.&lt;ref&gt;Paula Richman (2008), ''Ways of Celebrating Ram's Birth: Ramayana Week in Durban, South Africa'', Religions Of South Asia, Volume 2 Issue 2, pages 109–133&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[Jamaica]], other [[Caribbean]] countries, [[Mauritius]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and many other countries Hindu descendants of colonial era indentured workers brought by the British government from India have continued to observe Ram Navami along with their other traditional festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Vertovec|title=Hindu Trinidad: Religion, Ethnicity and Socio-Economic Change |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1gYAAAAYAAJ|year=1992|publisher=Macmillan Academic |isbn=978-0-333-53505-9|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also celebrated by Hindus in [[Fiji]], and those Fiji Hindus who have re-migrated elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian A. Hatcher|title=Hinduism in the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdeoCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-04631-6|pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, the largest minority Christian churches in the country are composed of new converts to Protestant and [[nontrinitarianism|non-trinitarian]] Christianity, a combined total up to 38,989 persons (1.3%). Due to the country's ethnic homogeneity, non-Christian religions such as [[Yazidism]] and [[Islam]] have only few adherents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ampop.am/followers-of-different-religions-in-armenia/|title=Կրոնական կազմը Հայաստանում {{!}} Ampop.am|last=Media|first=Ampop|date=2017-12-26|work=Ampop.am|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious demography==
[[File:Tiridates III of Armenia-Baptism.jpg|thumb|right|Baptism of [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]]]]
The country has an area of {{convert|11500|sqmi|km2}} and a population of 3 million. Approximately 98.1 percent of the population is ethnic Armenian. Armenians have a very strong cultural connection to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. About 93% of citizens belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church, an Eastern Christian denomination in communion with the other [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] churches. The Armenian Apostolic Church has its spiritual center at the [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]]. The head of the church is Catholicos [[Karekin II]].

According to the Census of 2011, the composition of people identifying with religions in Armenia is the following: Christianity 2,862,366 (94.8%), of whom 2,797,187 are [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] (92.5%); 29,280 [[Evangelical]]; 13,996 [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Rite]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin Rite]] Catholic; 8,695 [[Jehovah's Witness]]; 7,587 [[Eastern Orthodox]] (Russian, Ukrainian, Georgian, Greek); 2,874 [[Molokan]] (non-Orthodox Russians); 1,733 [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (Nestorian); 733 [[Protestant]]; 241 [[Mormon]]; 23,374 [[Yazidi]] (0.8%); 5,146 [[Hetanism|Pagan]] (0.2%); 812 [[Muslim]]; 5,299 other religions (0.2%); 121,587 no response (4.0%).&lt;ref name=census&gt;{{cite web|title=Armenian Census 2011|url=http://armstat.am/file/article/sv_03_13a_520.pdf|accessdate=25 October 2015|page=7|language=Armenian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yazidis are concentrated primarily in agricultural areas around Mount Aragats, northwest of the capital Yerevan. They live in 19 villages in the [[Aragatsotn Province]], two villages in the [[Armavir Province]], and one village in the [[Ararat Province]]. 

Armenian Catholics live mainly in the northern region, in seven villages in the [[Shirak Province]] and six villages in the [[Lori Province]]. 

[[Molokan|Molokans]] live in 10 villages in the [[Lori Province]], two villages in the [[Shirak Province]], and two villages in the [[Gegharkunik Province]].

Most Jews, [[Mormons]], Baha'is, Eastern Orthodox Christians, and Western Catholic (Latin Rite) Christians reside in the capital Yerevan, which has attracted a greater variety of peoples. Yerevan also has a small community of Muslims, including ethnic [[Kurds]], [[Iran]]ians, and temporary residents from the Middle East. Foreign missionary groups are active in the country.

==Freedom of religion==
{{main|Freedom of religion in Armenia}}

The Constitution as amended in 2005 provides for freedom of religion and the right to practice, choose, or change religious belief. It recognizes "the exclusive mission of the Armenian Church as a national church in the spiritual life, development of the national culture, and preservation of the national identity of the people of Armenia." The law places some restrictions on the religious freedom of religious groups other than the Armenian Church. The Law on Freedom of Conscience establishes the separation of church and state but it grants the Armenian Church official status as the national church.

==Traditional Armenian religions==
===Armenian Apostolic Church===
{{main|Armenian Apostolic Church}}
[[File:Armenian Church Structure.jpg|thumb|right|Procession of Armenian Apostolic priests.]]
According to tradition, Christianity was first introduced to this area by the [[apostles]] [[Bartholomew]] and [[Saint Jude|Thaddeus]] in the 1st century AD. Armenia became the first country to establish Christianity as its state [[religion]] when, in an event traditionally dated to 301 AD, [[St. Gregory the Illuminator]] convinced [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]], the [[Monarch|king]] of Armenia, to [[religious conversion|convert]] to Christianity. Before this, the dominant religion was [[Armenian paganism]], under the theological influence of [[Zoroastrianism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Hetanism===
{{Main|Armenian neopaganism}}
[[File:Hetan initiation ritual (1).png|thumb|Hetan "fire and sword" ritual of initiation at the Temple of Garni of Mihr-Vahagn.]]
Hetanism ([[:wikt:հեթանոսություն|Հեթանոսություն]], ''Hetanosutyun'') is a neo-[[ethnic religion]] movement in Armenia. Adherents call themselves "Hetans" (''Hetanos'' [[:wikt:հեթանոս|հեթանոս]], the Old Armenian biblical term loaned from Greek ἐθνικός "gentile"). The movement traces its origins back to the work of the early-20th-century political philosopher and revolutionary [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] and his doctrine of ''[[tseghakron]]'' (rejuvenation through national religion). In 1991, it was institutionalized by the [[armenology|armenologist]] [[Slak Kakosyan]] into the "Order of the Children of Ari" (''Arordineri Ukht''). The doctrine and mythology of the Hetan movement is codified into a book, the ''Ukhtagirk'', written by Kakosyan himself. The movement is strongly associated to [[Armenian nationalism]]. It finds some support from nationalist political parties of Armenia, particularly the [[Republican Party of Armenia]] and the [[Armenian Aryan Union|Union of Armenian Aryans]]. [[Ashot Navasardyan]], the founder of the Republican Party, which is also the currently leading party of the country, was a Hetan himself, as many other members of the party are.&lt;ref name="Antonyan"&gt;Yulia Antonyan. ''Re-creation of a Religion: Neopaganism in Armenia''. Yerevan State University. This and other papers about Armenian Hetanism are available [https://yerevan.academia.edu/YuliaAntonyan/Papers here].&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the early Christianization of Armenia, very little is known about the historical pre-Christian religion of Armenia. Armenian Neopagans worship the gods of a reconstructed Armenian pantheon: [[Hayk|Haik]], [[Aray]], [[Barsamin]], [[Aralez]], [[Anahit]], [[Mithra|Mihr]], [[Astghik]], [[Nuneh]], [[Tir (god)|Tir]], [[Tsovinar (goddess)|Tsovinar]], [[Amanor]], [[Spandaramet]], [[Gissaneh]], with a particular emphasis on the cult of the [[solar god]] [[Vahagn]]. They have re-consecrated the [[Garni Temple|Temple of Garni]] (a [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic-style]] temple rebuilt in 1975), originally a temple to Mihr, to Vahagn, and they use it for regular worship and as a center of activity.&lt;ref name="Antonyan"/&gt;

[[Hetanism]] is a growing [[ethnic religion|ethnic religious]] ("pagan", often defined "[[neopagan]]") movement. One survey suggest that indigenous Armenian religion is widespread and accepted by the population to the same degree as Christianity is. This may be due to the fact that there is no conflict between the ''Arordineri Ukht'' (the major Hetan organization) and the Armenian Apostolic Church; they coordinate their efforts in preserving Armenian cultural identity and in fighting foreign forces. The ''Arordineri Ukht'' is even supported by the ruling [[Republican Party of Armenia]], which in turn bases its ideology on ''[[tseghakron]]'' (native religion) and on the Hetan sacred book ''Ukhtagirk''. "Fire and sword" rituals of the Hetan tradition are often organized on the site of Apostolic churches and patronized by Apostolic priests.&lt;ref name=2004CSNSsurvey&gt;Karine Ter-Saakian. "[https://iwpr.net/global-voices/armenia-pagan-games Armenia: Pagan Games]". ''CRS'' Issue 247. The Armenian Apostolic Church takes an unusually relaxed view of its pagan competitors, considering its hostility to more recent evangelical groups."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other religions==

===Other Christianities===

====Eastern Orthodoxy====
{{See also|Georgian churches in Armenia}}
According to the Census of 2011, there are 8,587 adherents of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] in Armenia, mainly Russians, Ukrainians, Georgians and Greeks. Russian Orthodox community is centered around [[Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God]] in Yerevan, consecrated in 1912.

====Protestantism====
{{main|Protestantism in Armenia}}
Since the end of the Soviet Union, American Protestant missionaries have been proselytising in the country. The 2011 census counted 29,280 [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] (1% of the population) and 773 mainline [[Protestantism|Protestants]].

====Restorationism====
The [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have estimated their membership at 11,500; the 2011 census found 8,695.&lt;ref name=census/&gt; [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] claims approximately 3,000 adherents in Armenia at the end of 2011; the 2011 census found 241.&lt;ref name=census/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/country/armenia Summary information on church in Armenia]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Catholic Church====
{{main|Armenian Catholic Church}}
The [[Catholic Church]] in Armenia is divided between [[Latin Rite]] parishes (subject to [[Apostolic Administration of the Caucasus]]) and [[Armenian Catholic Church]]'s parishes. The 2011 census counted 13,996 Catholics.

===Yazidism===
{{main|Yazidis in Armenia}}
[[File:Aknalitch, Yezids temple Ziarat - panoramio.jpg|thumb|'''Yazid's temple Ziarat in the village of Aknalich''']]
About 1% of Armenia's population (23,374 as per the 2011 census), mostly ethnic [[Yazidis]] an [[ethno-religious]] group living in the western part of the country, follow [[Yazidism]], one of the [[Yazdânism|Yazdan]] religions. Many Yazidis came to Armenia and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] during the 19th and early 20th centuries to escape religious persecution. Relations between Yazidis and [[Armenians]] are strong.  The world's largest Yazidi temple is constructed in the small village of [[Aknalich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/25/worlds-largest-yazidi-temple-under-construction-in-armenia|title=World's largest Yazidi temple under construction in Armenia|last1=Sherwood|first1=Harriet|date=25 July 2016|website=The Guardian|access-date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judaism ===
{{main|History of the Jews in Armenia}}
Currently there are an estimated 750 Jews in the country, a remnant of a once larger community.  Most left Armenia for [[Israel]] after the collapse of the Soviet Union because of in pursuit of better living standards.  Still, despite the small numbers, high intermarriage rate and relative isolation, a lot of enthusiasm exists to help the community meet its needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsj.org/Armenia.shtml Advocates on Behalf of Jews in Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States, and Eurasia: Armenia and Jews] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522051120/http://www.ncsj.org/Armenia.shtml|date=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
{{main|Islam in Armenia}}
[[File:Erivanmosque.jpg|thumb|Minaret of the Urban Mosque in Erivan]]
[[Azeris]] and [[Kurds]] living in Armenia traditionally practiced [[Islam]], but most Azeris have fled the country due to the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].  In 2009, the Pew Research Center estimated that less than 0.1% of the population, or about 1,000 people, were Muslims. The 18th century [[Blue Mosque, Yerevan|Blue Mosque]] is open for Friday prayers.

Throughout the history Armenians did not convert to Islam in large numbers despite long periods of Muslim rule. During the Arabic conquest, Islam came to the Armenians; however, very few Armenians converted to Islam, since Christians were not required to convert by Muslim law. 

There is, however, a minority of ethnic Armenian Muslims, known as [[Hamshenis]], the vast majority of which live outside of Armenia mostly in [[Turkey]] and [[Russia]]. 

=== Sects ===
Since the early 1990s, foreign missionaries, esoteric and sectarian groups penetrated into Armenia.

==== Baháí Faith ====
{{main|Bahá'í Faith in Armenia}}
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] in Armenia begins with some involvements in the banishments and execution of the [[Báb]],&lt;ref name="Aqasi"&gt;{{Cite book|title=the Bahá’í Encyclopedia Project|last=Quinn|first=Sholeh A.|publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States|year=2009|editor-last=Morrison|editor-first=Gayle|volume=Online|place=|pages=|contribution=Aqasi, Haji Mirza (‘Abbas Iravani)(c. 1783–1849)|id=|contribution-url=http://www.bahai-encyclopedia-project.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=45:aqasi-haji-mirza-abbas-iravani-&amp;catid=37:biography&amp;Itemid=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Founder of the Bábí Faith, viewed by Bahá'ís as a precursor religion.

'''{{nihongo|Rissho University|立正大学|Risshō Daigaku}}''', one of the oldest [[university|universities]] in [[Japan]], was founded in 1580, when a seminary was established as a learning center for young [[monk]]s of the [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren shu]].&lt;ref name="ris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ris.ac.jp/en/about/history.html|title=History : About Rissho Univ. : Rissho University Official Web Site|publisher=ris.ac.jp|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's name came from the Rissho Ankoku Ron, a thesis written by [[Nichiren]], a prominent [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[priest]] of the [[Kamakura period]].&lt;ref name="ris2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ris.ac.jp/en/|title=Welcome to Rissho University Official Web Site|publisher=ris.ac.jp|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rissho University enrolls approximately 11,900 students. It has 14 [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] departments and 6 [[graduate school]] research departments on two separate campuses.

==Campuses==

In the [[Tenrikyo]] religion, the '''Service''' (おつとめ ''Otsutome'') is the most important prayer ritual, along with the [[Sazuke]]. The Service comes in fundamental forms (i.e. the Kagura Service and Teodori) and several variant forms (such as the Morning and Evening Service). The text to the Service is the ''[[Mikagura-uta]],'' one of the three scriptures of Tenrikyo.

==Kagura Service==
The most important Service is the Kagura Service (''Kagura zutome''). This service is the masked dance that is performed around the [[Jiba (Tenrikyo)|Kanrodai]] where [[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]] – located in Tenri City, Japan – is situated.&lt;ref&gt;Morishita, Saburo Shawn. "Teodori: Cosmological Building and Social Consolidation in a Ritual Dance." ''Editrice Pontificia Universita Gregoriana,'' 2001, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hashimoto cites three meanings behind the performance of the Kagura Service–to represent God's creative power [[Tenrikyo creation narrative|at the time of human conception]] and thus inspire humankind to live the [[Joyous Life]], to reconfirm [[Tenrikyo anthropology|humankind's relationship with God and the universe]], and to realize the importance of living by God's original intention for humankind.&lt;ref&gt;Hashimoto, Taketo. 1981. "The Kagura Service—Its Structure and Meaning." ''The Theological Perspectives of Tenrikyo,'' p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance===
[[File:Kagura Service Performers Positions.png|thumb|Illustration of the Kagura Service.]]
The Kagura Service is performed by ten people, five males and five females, who surround the Kanrodai. Each person represents a different divine providence that participated in the creation, wearing a unique ''kagura'' mask and dancing to unique hand movements (see diagram to the right and table below).&lt;ref&gt;Fukaya, ''Words of the Path.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The performers of the Kagura Service are chosen from the inner circle of the administrative staff at Tenrikyo Church Headquarters. The ten performers and the musical instrument players switch roles on a monthly basis. However, the roles of the Shinbashira and his wife remain the same throughout all performances and that is to represent ''Kunitokotachi-no-Mikoto'' and ''Omotari-no-Mikoto'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Morishita, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

The song text for the Kagura Service is exactly the same as that of the Seated Service (the first, second, and third sections of the ''[[Mikagura-uta]]''); the only difference between them is the number of repetitions of the third section. The first section is repeated twenty-one times, the second section is performed only once, and the third section is performed seven times in sets of three, amounting to a total of twenty-one times.&lt;ref&gt;Morishita, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kagura masks===
The ''kagura'' masks were first produced around or before 1874 by Nakayama's brother, Kyosuke Maegawa, but the masks he made have since been lost. However, it is assumed that the later masks preserve the essential features of the original masks since the ''[[Osashizu]]'' instructed followers to model new masks after the original ones.&lt;ref&gt;''A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms,'' p.185.&lt;/ref&gt; The masks currently in use are made of wood, but earlier ones seem to have been made of papier-mâché.&lt;ref&gt;Nakayama, Shozen. ''Hitokoto hanashi sono 3'' and ''Zoku Hitokoto hanashi sono 2.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===
Hashimoto notes that the divine providences of the Kagura Service are oriented to reflect the metaphysical principle of oneness in two (''futatsu hitotsu''), which is the idea that the universe exists by integrating two opposing elements. The opposing elements do not become identical, nor does one element become subsumed by the other; rather, the opposing elements complement each other and retain their distinctive qualities while also creating a more complete entity. Oneness in two is likened to the concept of ''[[Unity of opposites|coincidentia oppositorum]]'' in the Western philosophical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Hashimoto, Taketo. 1981. "The Kagura Service—Its Structure and Meaning." ''The Theological Perspectives of Tenrikyo,'' pp. 185–6.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Kunitokotachi-no-Mikoto,'' the providence of water, and ''Omotari-no-Mikoto,'' the providence of fire, are opposing elements which are placed on opposing sides, north and south respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Hashimoto, Taketo. 1981. "The Kagura Service—Its Structure and Meaning." ''The Theological Perspectives of Tenrikyo,'' p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seated Service==
The Seated Service takes the place of the Kagura Service at places of worship besides Church Headquarters. The Seated Service and Kagura Service use the same text (first, second, and third sections of the Mikagura-uta) and the same instrumentation.

However, unlike the Kagura Service, the Seated Service is performed by six people, three men and three women, sitting in a line facing the shrine and performing the same hand movements as one another.&lt;ref&gt;A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, p.368-9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Seated Service, the third section of the Mikagura-uta is performed ''three'' times in sets of three, which is different from the Kagura Service, where the same section is performed ''seven'' times in sets of three.

The Seated Service embodies "the truth of six fundamental aspects of divine providence," which can be understood to mean the "six fundamental aspects of God's providence during creation" or "six fundamental aspects of God's providence in the human body."&lt;ref&gt;A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, p.368-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teodori==
[[File:Tenrikyo Service dance.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The ''Teodori'' performed at Tenrikyo Church Headquarters.]]

The Teodori refers to the part of the Service that is sung, danced, and played to the text of the Eight Verses of the Yorozuyo and the Twelve Songs, or the fourth and fifth sections of the ''[[Mikagura-uta]].''&lt;ref&gt;''A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms,'' p.427-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

A performance of the Teodori requires six dancers, three males on the left and three females on the right, who form a single line facing the shrine. The six Teodori dancers perform exactly the same hand and foot movements in unison, expressing the meaning of the songs through the dance.&lt;ref&gt;Fukaya, ''Words of the Path.''&lt;/ref&gt; The choreography of the Teodori is called ''Otefuri.'' The Teodori also requires the full set of musical accompaniment: six men's instruments (''[[hyoshigi]]'', ''[[cymbals|chanpon]]'', ''[[gong|surigane]]'', ''[[taiko]]'', ''[[tsuzumi|kotsuzumi]]'', and ''[[fue]]''), three women's instruments (''[[Koto (instrument)|koto]]'', ''[[shamisen]]'', ''[[kokyū]]''), and one or two singers (''jikata'').

==Monthly Service==
[[Image:Montsuki.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tenrikyo service performers wearing traditional [[montsuki]] after a monthly service.]]
The original Japanese term for "Monthly Service" is ''tsukinamisai,'' which translates to "a regular or recurring monthly festival." During the Monthly Service, which is the central [[liturgy]] of a Tenrikyo church, the entire text of the ''[[Mikagura-uta]]'' ("The Songs for the Service") is sung to specific choreography and instrumental accompaniment.

The monthly Service performed at [[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]] is different from Monthly Services performed at other churches due to the [[cosmological]] significance of the spot around which the Headquarters was constructed. The monthly service at Headquarters begins with the Kagura Service followed by the Teodori, and is always performed on the twenty-sixth of each month.

A monthly service at other churches begins with the Seated Service followed by the Teodori, and can be performed at any fixed day of the month determined by each church (e.g. third Sunday, every month on the 8th).&lt;ref&gt;Morishita, Saburo Shawn. "Teodori: Cosmological Building and Social Consolidation in a Ritual Dance." ''Editrice Pontificia Universita Gregoriana,'' 2001, p.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

From late 1888 through the following year, a number of churches were established in various districts, and some of them requested permission to perform the Service when their sanctuaries were completed. In response, the Divine Directions made it clear that the Kagura Service could not be performed anywhere other than at the [[Jiba (Tenrikyo)|Jiba for the Kanrodai]]. The kagura masks were not to be worn—or even merely placed in front of the performers—at local churches, though the use of all the other implements including the musical instruments was allowed. Local churches' monthly services, performed on the days sanctioned by Church Headquarters, include the seated service—which is performed by six people seated on the raised floor performing the same hand movements as those used in the morning and evening services—followed by the Teodori.&lt;ref&gt;Fukaya, ''Words of the Path.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of the twelve monthly services of the year, two of them carry particular significance and are referred to as "grand services" (''taisai,'' "grand festival"). The spring grand service held in January commemorates the withdrawal of the physical life of the foundress (January 26), and the autumn grand service held in October commemorates the founding of Tenrikyo (October 26). However both services are performed in the same manner as the other monthly services.&lt;ref&gt;Morishita, Saburo Shawn. "Teodori: Cosmological Building and Social Consolidation in a Ritual Dance." ''Editrice Pontificia Universita Gregoriana,'' 2001, p.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of a Monthly Service requires a minimum of six dancers (three men and three women), six men's instruments (''[[hyoshigi]]'', ''[[cymbals|chanpon]]'', ''[[gong|surigane]]'', ''[[taiko]]'', ''[[tsuzumi|kotsuzumi]]'', and ''[[fue]]''), three women's instruments (''[[Koto (instrument)|koto]]'', ''[[shamisen]]'', ''[[kokyū]]''), and one or two singers (''jikata'').

===Variations===
The New Year's Service (''gantansai''), held on the first day of the year, is performed exactly in the same manner as a monthly service.&lt;ref&gt;Morishita, Saburo Shawn. "Teodori: Cosmological Building and Social Consolidation in a Ritual Dance." ''Editrice Pontificia Universita Gregoriana,'' 2001, p.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Memorial Service (''mitamasai''), dedicated to ancestors and predecessors of the Tenrikyo faith, is performed at Church Headquarters twice every year, once in the spring and once in the autumn. Memorial Services have also been held to commemorate the passing of Shinbashiras. These services consist of a monthly service like gathering with the performance of the Teodori but not the Kagura Service.&lt;ref&gt;Morishita, Saburo Shawn. "Teodori: Cosmological Building and Social Consolidation in a Ritual Dance." ''Editrice Pontificia Universita Gregoriana,'' 2001, p.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fukaya, ''Words of the Path.'' "The Teodori, the Dance with Hand Movements."&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 26th of each month, a Service called ''Yohaishiki'' is held at churches and missions away from Church Headquarters to coincide with the  Monthly Service at Church Headquarters.

==Morning and Evening Services==
[[Image:Tenrikyo homeshrine.JPG|thumb|right|170px|A follower's shrine]]
The Morning and Evening Services are performed every day at all Tenrikyo places of worship: Church Headquarters, regional churches, mission stations, and fellowships. The times of the morning and evening services at Church Headquarters are based on sunrise and sunset, as are those at other places of worship. During the Morning and Evening Services, the same hand movements and the same sections of the Mikagura-uta are performed the same numbers of times as in the Seated Service. However, the Morning and Evening Services use a reduced set of instruments – ''[[gong|surigane]],'' ''[[cymbals|chanpon]],'' ''[[hyoshigi]],'' counter (''kazutori''), and ''[[taiko]]'' – which are placed next to one another in a line in order of mention from left to right as one faces the altars. Many followers perform their Morning and Evening Services at their homes, often using only their wooden clappers or no musical instrument at all.&lt;ref&gt;A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, p.378.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually after the Morning Service, two songs from the Teodori are practiced.&lt;ref&gt;Morishita, Saburo Shawn. "Teodori: Cosmological Building and Social Consolidation in a Ritual Dance." ''Editrice Pontificia Universita Gregoriana,'' 2001, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations===
Another type of service is the ''onegai zutome'', a prayer service or a petition service. This is a type of service that asks distinctively for God’s intervention for a specific purpose. The most common form of a prayer service is when a community makes an appeal or petition to God to save a person from a particular illness. Other forms of a prayer service is that of asking God that a particular church activity, such as a spiritual retreat, a pilgrimage trip, or even a church association event that involves recreation, goes well. The prayer service is performed together with two instruments on the upper dais – the wooden clappers and the counter – with the other members of the congregation praying from the worship hall.&lt;ref&gt;Morishita, Saburo Shawn. "Teodori: Cosmological Building and Social Consolidation in a Ritual Dance." ''Editrice Pontificia Universita Gregoriana,'' 2001, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service instruments==
[[Image:Tsukinamisai.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Instruments used to perform Otsutome]]
[[File:Tenrikyo-service-music2012.ogg|right|thumb|(audio) Music being performed during a local daily service.]]
Nine musical instruments are employed in the performance of the Monthly Service – ''[[hyoshigi|hyōshigi]]'' (wooden clappers), ''chanpon'' (cymbals), ''[[Kane (instrument)|surigane]]'' (small gong), ''[[taiko]]'' (large drum), ''[[tsuzumi|kotsuzumi]]'' (shoulder drum), ''[[Shinobue|fue]]'' (bamboo flute), ''[[shamisen]]'', ''[[kokyū]]'', and ''[[Koto (musical instrument)|koto]]''. During the Morning and Evening Services the maximum number of instruments is reduced to four – ''hyoshigi'', ''chanpon'', ''surigane'', and ''taiko'' – and a ''kazutori'' (counting implement) is added in order to keep track of the repetitions of ''Mikagura-uta'' Section One, which is performed 21 times.

===Specifying the instruments===
The earliest instrument to be associated with Tenrikyo prayer, even before the Service was composed, is the ''hyoshigi.'' In 1853, Nakayama Miki sent her youngest daughter Kokan to Naniwa (modern-day [[Osaka]]) to do missionary work there. On a street corner Kokan is said to have chanted "Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto! Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto!" to the accompaniment of the ''hyoshigi.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama'', 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, Tsuji Chusaku chanted the same words along with the ''hyoshigi,'' though not to do missionary work as Kokan had done, but to pray for his sister Kura.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama'', 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, several early Tenrikyo followers decided to pay their respects to [[Ōyamato Shrine]] by playing musical instruments, dancing, and chanting "Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto! Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto!" as others had previously done. Unbeknownst to the followers, they were disrupting an important seven-day prayer at the shrine, and the priests from the shrine soon seized the instruments and had the followers detained.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama'', 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The instruments that were seized were a ''taiko,'' two ''[[suzu]]'' (bells), seven ''hyoshigi,'' and a ''tebyoshi.''&lt;ref&gt;Doi, Y. (2013). "Restoration" Reexamined: Through Changes in the Musical Instruments. ''Tenri Journal of Religion, 41,'' 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the historical record and certain ''[[Ofudesaki]]'' verses referring to musical instruments, Nakayama Miki may have specified the nine musical instruments of the Service starting around 1875. Nakayama taught how to play the women's instruments – ''koto'', ''kokyu'', and ''shamisen'' – in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 41,'' 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Service was first performed with the full set of musical instruments on 30 September 1880.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama, Foundress of Tenrikyo,'' 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes made to the instruments===
Ever since Nakayama Miki's passing in 1887, the ''fue,'' ''chanpon,'' ''hyōshigi,'' and ''koto'' have remained unchanged to the present day. However, the other instruments have undergone changes.

In 1888, the first Shinbashira, Nakayama Shinnosuke, went sightseeing at [[Nikkō, Tochigi|Nikkō]] and attended a ''[[gagaku]]'' performance at [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū]]. Influenced by the instruments he saw, he replaced certain Service instruments, which he felt were unimpressive, to their analogues in the ''sanko'' (三鼓, 'three drums') of the ''gagaku'' orchestra – ''[[Tsuri-daiko|gakudaiko]]'', ''[[Shōko (instrument)|gakushōko]]'', and ''[[Kakko (instrument)|kakko]]'':&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 41,'' 41-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The ''taiko'' originally specified was a ''[[shime-daiko]],'' a drum used for [[nagauta]] and other types of Japanese folk music.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 41,'' 38-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''shime-daiko'' was replaced by the ''gakudaiko,'' which is larger and more elaborately decorated.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 41,'' 42-3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''surigane'' originally specified was a two-gong ''surigane,'' a gong that was used by candy vendors at the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 41,'' 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; The two-gong ''surigane'' was replaced by the ''gakushōko.''&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 41,'' 42-3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''kotsuzumi'' was replaced by the ''kakko.''&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 41,'' 42-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, the [[Home Ministry]] issued "Directive No. 12," which called for stricter government control over Tenrikyo's activities. In light of the directive, Tenrikyo officials changed two of the women's instruments:&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 41,'' 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The ''shamisen'' was replaced by a modified form of the [[biwa|''satsumabiwa'']], which was made to resemble the ''shamisen'' and to have three strings like the ''shamisen.'' This instrument was nicknamed the ''tenribiwa.''&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 41,'' 44-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''kokyū'' was replaced by a modified form of the [[Ichigenkin|''yakumogoto'']], which was bowed instead of plucked in order to imitate the frictive sound of the ''kokyu.'' This instrument was nicknamed the ''hatsusegoto.''&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 41,'' 44-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the fiftieth anniversary of Nakayama Miki's death in 1936, followers decided to revert as much as possible to the instruments that she had originally taught her followers. The ''kotsuzumi,'' ''shamisen,'' and ''kokyū'' were restored, while the ''taiko'' and ''surigane'' continue to resemble their gagaku counterparts. No major changes have been made to the instruments since 1936.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenri Journal of Religion, 41,'' 45-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gagaku===
Though ''[[gagaku]]'' is not performed during the Service proper, it is sometimes performed during the offering ritual and the prayer ritual which precede the Service. ''Gagaku'' became a part of Tenrikyo's ceremonies because of Tenrikyo's early association with Shinto. The first time ''gagaku'' was associated with Tenrikyo's ceremonies was in 1888 during the observation of Nakayama Miki's first anniversary of her death.&lt;ref&gt;Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion (1997). Gagaku. In ''Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten.'' (pp. 188). Tenri, Japan: Tenrikyō Dōyūsha.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mikagura-uta==
{{see also|Mikagura-uta}}
The earliest account of the Service occurs in the year 1863, when follower Chusaku Tsuji prayed for the recovery of his sister's insanity. Nakayama taught Tsuji and other followers at the time to chant the divine name, "Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto! Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto!" while beating the ''[[hyoshigi]]'' (wooden clappers). The length of the service was determined by burning an entire incense stick.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama, Foundress of Tenrikyo,'' p. 36-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Place for the Service, which might be regarded as a sanctuary, was not built until 1864, some twenty-six years after Tenrikyo's founding in 1838.

In the autumn of 1866, Nakayama taught the first section of the Mikagura-uta, along with the melody and hand movements. This section was originally worded, 
:あしきはらいたすけたまい / てんりわうのみこと ''Ashiki harai, tasuke tamae, / Tenri-O-no-Mikoto.''
::Sweep away evils and save us, / [[Tenri-O-no-Mikoto]].

In January 1867, Nakayama composed Songs One, Two, and Three of the Mikagura-uta. By August, she wrote the rest of the Twelve Songs (十二下り目), completing the fifth section of the Mikagura-uta. Over the next three years, She devoted her time to adapting melodies and dance movements to these songs as well as teaching them to her followers. An account of how Nakayama began to instruct the followers in the melody and dance of the Service goes:&lt;ref&gt;''A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms,'' p.382-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When the sacred songs of twelve chapters were completed, Oyasama told her attendants: "These are the songs for the Service. Try singing them to the best tune you can find." Each of them sang to his own tune. After listening to it, Oyasama said, "Thank you for your singing, but none of them will do. You should sing them this way." She sang loudly Herself. Then She told her attendants: "These are the songs of truth. So you must dance to the truth. Try dancing the best way you can." Each of them arranged the dance and showed it to Oyasama. Afterward, She said: "Thank you for your dancing, but no one danced to the truth. You should dance in this way. You should not just dance. You should dance the truth." So saying, She stood up and performed the dance movements Herself in order to teach the attendants. In this way, Oyasama Herself taught the singing and the dancing after having all the attendants try on their own" (''Anecdotes of Oyasama,'' #18)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1869, Nakayama started the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'' (one of Tenrikyo's three scriptures), which explained the significance of the Service as the basis for salvation.

In 1870 she taught her followers the second section of the Mikagura-uta, which begins,
:ちよとはなしかみのいふこときいてくれ ''Choto hanashi Kami no yu koto kiite kure...''
::Just a word: Listen to what God says...

In the same year, Nakayama composed the fourth section of the Mikagura-uta, the Eight Verses of the Yorozuyo, and taught it to her followers. Then in 1874, the kagura masks, completed some time previously, were collected by Nakayama.

Several events transpired in 1875. In that year, Nakayama identified the Jiba, the precise spot where, according to the Tenrikyo's creation story, humankind was conceived 900,099,999 years before the founding of the teaching on October 26, 1838. Nakayama taught the third section of the Mikagura-uta, completing the entire set of songs for the Service as initially composed. This section was initially worded,
:あしきはらいたすけたまい / いちれつすますかんろふだい ''Ashiki harai, tasuke tamae, / Ichiretsu sumasu Kanrodai.''
::Sweep away evils and save us, / The Kanrodai which purifies all humankind equally.

Also in the same year she taught the hand movements for eleven different services to address specific issues.

In 1877, she began to teach the stringed instruments for the service. She also urged her followers to perform the service. It was on the lunar calendar date of 26 August 1880 that the service was performed for the first time with the full set of instruments, it might be said that this marked the provisional completion of the followers' implementation of what oyasama had taught about the service.

In 1881, the bottom two layers of the stone Kanrodai, which was to serve as the center for the Service, were completed. The following year, however, those layers were confiscated by the police. In the wake of this incident, Oyasama made alterations in the wording of the first and third sections of the Mikagura-uta, though she made no change to the hand movements:

:あしきをはらうてたすけたまえ / てんりわうのみこと ''Ashiki o harote tasuke tamae, / Tenri-O-no-Mikoto.''
::Sweeping away evils, please save us, / Tenri-O-no-Mikoto.

:あしきをはらうてたすけせきこむ / いちれつすましてかんろだい ''Ashiki o harote, tasuke sekikomu / Ichiretsu sumashite Kanrodai.
::Sweeping away evils, hasten to save us. / All humankind equally purified, / The Kanrodai.

==Eleven different Services==
In addition to the Services already mentioned, Nakayama taught eleven different Services (''juichi-tori no tsutome'' 十一通りのつとめ) to her followers for specific purposes.&lt;ref&gt;The Life of Oyasama, Chapter Five.&lt;/ref&gt; Each Service has a unique set of words and hand movements performed in place of [[Mikagura-uta#Section One|Section One from the Songs for the Kagura]]. Shozen Nakayama, the second Shinbashira (spiritual and administrative leader of Tenrikyo), has suggested three categories for these Services:

*Services associated with the human body: Service for Safe Childbirth, Service against Smallpox, Service for Conception of a Child, Service to Cure Cripples
*Services associated with crops: Service of Fertilizer, Service for Germination, Service against Insect Pests, Service for Rain, Service for Cessation of Rain, Service for Harvest
*Service to settle circumstances: Service against Rebellion

Only the Service for Safe Childbirth and Service for Germination are still performed today. The only other Services that have supporting evidence indicating they were ever conducted at all are the Service against Smallpox, the Service for Fertilizer, and the Service for Rain.

'''Shery''' (or '''Sheri''') is the name of an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian official who lived in the [[Old Kingdom]], in the Fourth Dynasty.

==Sources==
Shery is known from his [[mastaba]] at [[Saqqara]] that was found and partly recorded in the nineteenth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Auguste Mariette: ''Les mastabas des l' ancient empire''. p. 92-94 ([http://www.gizapyramids.org/pdf%20library/mariette_mastabas.pdf online]).&lt;/ref&gt; His wife was called [[Khentetek]]; a second woman appearing in his tomb decoration was called Inet and may have been a second wife (or mother?). Shery held the title “Overseer of all wab-priests of king [[Seth-Peribsen|Peribsen]] in the [[necropolis]] of king [[Senedj]]”, “Great One of the Ten of Upper Egypt” and “God´s Servant of Senedj”. Senedj´s name is written in [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|archaic]] form and set in a cartouche, which is an [[anachronism]], since the cartouche itself was not yet used until the end of [[Third Dynasty of Egypt|3rd dynasty]] under king [[Huni]].&lt;ref&gt;Auguste Mariette: ''Les mastabas de l’Ancien Empire''. Paris 1885, page 92–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner Kaiser: ''Zur Nennung von Sened und Peribsen in Sakkara'', In: ''Göttinger Miszellen'', no. 122, (1991), page 49–55.&lt;/ref&gt; As the latter king is little known, the titles given to Shery are of special importance. The inscription for Shery suggests to Egyptologists, such as [[Wolfgang Helck]], that Peribsen died during the reign of Senedj and that the relationship between the two kings was a peaceful one.

==Plot==
The series chronicles the lives of a close-knit, Irish-American [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] [[Catholicism|Catholic]] family whose matriarch takes their reputation in the community very seriously. In the pilot episode, their perfect image is shattered when each family member has a secret revealed to the community: middle child Kenny is gay, oldest child Jimmy is anorexic, youngest child Shannon is running a money scam and might be atheist, and parents Eileen and Pat are no longer in love and wish to divorce. Subsequent episodes explore the new family dynamic as Pat and Eileen separate and everyone reconciles Kenny's sexuality with their faith.

==Controversies==
===News of the series' pickup===

The news of the series' pick-up attracted attention and controversy before its debut. On May 12, 2015, the day it was announced that the series had been added to the ABC network schedule, [[Christian right]] groups such as the [[American Family Association]] and the [[Family Research Council]] called for a boycott and petitioned to prevent the series from airing. They also cited Savage's views on religion, sexuality, and [[same-sex marriage]], which they believed had been infused into the series due to it being based on his life, but Savage claimed that the concept went in a different direction since he was not involved in the writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/conservative-groups-vow-to-quash-dan-savages-abc-sitcom-pilot/ |title=Conservative Groups Vow to Quash Dan Savage's ABC Sitcom Pilot |website=Mediaite |date=April 10, 2015 |last=Nguyen |first=Tina |access-date=February 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bisexual joke===
The second-season episode "The Real Acceptance" featured a joke regarding bisexuals, in which Kenny, who is openly gay, compared being bisexual to having "webbed toes" or "money problems". Bisexual actress [[Sara Ramirez]], who played the bisexual character [[Callie Torres]] on ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', criticized [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and the series, finding the joke offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://deadline.com/2017/02/sara-ramirez-abc-the-real-oneals-bisexual-joke-1201914471/| title=Sara Ramirez Blasts ABC &amp; 'The Real O'Neals' For Bisexual Joke|first=Amanda |last=N'Duka|date=February 16, 2017 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]| accessdate= February 23, 2017|archivedate= February 18, 2017| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170218071818/http://deadline.com/2017/02/sara-ramirez-abc-the-real-oneals-bisexual-joke-1201914471/ | deadurl =no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before founding Animals as Leaders, he was the guitarist for the technical metalcore band Reflux.&lt;ref name="WCP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/music/2009/02/09/qa-animals-as-leaders/|last=Allyn|first=Bobby|title=Q&amp;A: Animals as Leaders|work=[[Washington City Paper]]|accessdate=2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has recorded and released four albums with Animals as Leaders: a [[Animals as Leaders (album)|self-titled debut]], ''[[Weightless (Animals as Leaders album)|Weightless]]'', ''[[The Joy of Motion]]'' and their most recent album, ''[[The Madness of Many]]''.  Guitar World ranks Abasi at #97 on their list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of all time.

==Life and career==

===Background===
Born in Washington D.C. to Nigerian immigrants to the United States,&lt;ref name="noisecreep.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noisecreep.com/animals-as-leaders-tosin-abasi-first-generation-american/ | title=Animals as leaders Tosin Abasi First Generation American}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abasi's first name "Oluwatosin" means "God is worthy to be served" in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourbabynamer.com/meaning-of-Oluwatosin.html|title=Oluwatosin|website=Baby Namer|accessdate=December 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, Abdul Abasi, is a former drill sergeant in the [[United States military]] and is currently a fashion designer.

Abasi is a mainly self-taught guitarist. He first picked up a guitar at his friend's house, simply strumming it and making up basic [[Lick (music)|licks]] on the spot. At this time he was being exposed to some music through learning the clarinet in elementary school. He later began to rent [[Glam metal|hair metal]] guitarists' instructional video tapes from his local music store, saying that some "were videos you did not want to be caught watching" due to racy material in certain tapes (e.g. women in bikinis).&lt;ref name="YouTube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMv8739BtiA|title=Guitar Power ep. 1 featuring Tosin Abasi|work=YouTube|accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abasi said that when he decided to learn the guitar, his father was "totally liberal about the whole thing and encouraging and proud" and in fact, bought him his first guitar. However his mother initially held a more conservative outlook. Tosin said in an interview, “My mom definitely represents more of the traditional immigrant mentality of education and conventional channels being way more important than a creative endeavor".&lt;ref name="noisecreep.com"/&gt;

===Early career===
He was the guitarist for the Silver Spring, Maryland-based metal band PSI. He joined Reflux in the early to mid-2000s.  During a Reflux show, [[Prosthetic Records]] noticed his skill and offered him a record deal as a solo artist. At first, he refused, saying he didn't feel comfortable with his skill level to write his own record.&lt;ref name=WCP/&gt; Afterwards, Abasi enrolled at the Atlanta Institute of Music. After graduating, he contacted Prosthetic Records asking if the offer still held.&lt;ref name="GEdge"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guitaredge.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=509:tosin-abasi-8-string-animal&amp;catid=45:interviews&amp;Itemid=66 |title=Tosin Abasi: 8-String Animal |work=Guitar Edge |first=Elliott |last=Politte |accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then formed his "solo" project, [[Animals as Leaders]], the name loosely being derived from the book ''[[Ishmael (novel)|Ishmael]]''.&lt;ref name="WCP"/&gt;

===Success with Animals as Leaders and onward===
In 2009, he recorded the first Animals as Leaders release with [[Misha Mansoor]] (of [[Periphery (band)|Periphery]]), who produced and recorded the album with Tosin, as well as programming the drums. Javier Reyes and [[Navene Koperweis]] were enlisted on rhythm guitar and drums, respectively, after the completion of the album, turning the project into a full touring band.&lt;ref name="GEdge"/&gt; He also toured with the band [[Born of Osiris]] as a stand-in guitarist for former member Matt Pantelis whilst they were auditioning for a permanent replacement.

In 2011, Tosin started putting together material for a new band, T.R.A.M., consisting of his Animals As Leaders bandmate Javier Reyes, Suicidal Tendencies drummer Eric Moore, and former [[The Mars Volta]] wind instrumentalist [[Adrián Terrazas-González]]. "T.R.A.M." stands for Terrazas, Reyes, Abasi, Moore. In mid-March 2011, T.R.A.M. played their first show at [[Sxsw|South by Southwest]], a multi-day music festival in Austin, Texas. Tosin explained that he formed T.R.A.M. as a trio consisting of himself, Javier and Adrian as an outlet for some ideas he had written which he felt did not fit with Animals as Leaders. Eric Moore was not added into the line-up until the recording phase of the album, and wrote and performed all the drums on the album within a few weeks.

Animals as Leaders released their second album, entitled "Weightless", on November 8, 2011.  Abasi was reportedly meeting with [[Misha Mansoor]] again in late 2012, and it was reported that a new Animals as Leaders album was in the works, due to be released in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/peripherys-misha-mansoor-working-new-animals-leaders-album |title=Periphery's Misha Mansoor Working on New Animals as Leaders Album |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At NAMM 2013, Tosin Abasi's signature guitar, the Ibanez TAM 100, was revealed. This guitar is based upon the [[Ibanez RG2228]] model, which he had been using for some years, and contains his signature [[DiMarzio]] Ionizer pickups.

On March 19, 2014, the [[Animals As Leaders]]' album ''[[The Joy of Motion]]'' was made available for streaming, via YouTube. On March 24, 2014, the album was released in Europe, March 25 in North America and on March 28 in Australia and New Zealand by Sumerian Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2014/03/19/stream-new-animals-leaders-album-joy-motion-right-now/|title=Stream the New Animals as Leaders Album The Joy of Motion Right Now!|work=MetalSucks|accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was met with widely positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/animals-as-leaders-the-joy-of-motion-review-596556|title=Animals As Leaders - The Joy Of Motion review|author=Chris Bird (Total Guitar)|publisher=Musicradar.com|accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/61502/Animals-as-Leaders-The-Joy-of-Motion/|title=Review: Animals As Leaders - The Joy of Motion - Sputnikmusic|publisher=Sputnikmusic.com|accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, Tosin appeared in the first episode of Guitar Power, a web-series sponsored by D'Addario String and Rolling Stone Magazine.&lt;ref name="YouTube"/&gt;

As of March 2014, he was on tour with Animals As Leaders. In October 2014, it was revealed that Abasi would join [[Joe Satriani]], [[Guthrie Govan]], and [[Mike Keneally]] on the [[G3 (tour)|G4 tour]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="G3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guitarworld.com/joe-satriani-announces-2015-g4-experience-featuring-guthrie-govan-tosin-abasi-mike-keneally-and-more-video | title=Joe Satriani Announces 2015 G4 Experience Featuring Guthrie Govan, Tosin Abasi, Mike Keneally and More — Video | publisher=''[[Guitar World]]'' | date=October 28, 2014 | accessdate=January 12, 2015 | author=Fanelli, Damian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April and May 2016, Abasi joined [[Nuno Bettencourt]], [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], [[Steve Vai]], and [[Zakk Wylde]], as part of the [[Generation Axe]] tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://generationaxe.com/| title=Generation Axe| accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supergroup later reprised their tour in 2017 in Asia, and North America once more in 2018.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12042">The '''Tzadikim Nistarim''' ({{lang-he-n|צַדִיקִים נִסתָּרים}}, "hidden righteous ones") or '''Lamed Vav Tzadikim''' ({{lang-he-n|ל"ו צַדִיקִים}},&lt;span style="color:white"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;"36 righteous ones"), often abbreviated to ''Lamed Vav(niks)'',{{ref label|Note1|a|a}} refers to '''36 righteous people''', a notion rooted within the more [[Kabbalah|mystical]] dimensions of [[Judaism]]. The singular form is '''Tzadik Nistar''' ({{lang-he-n|צַדִיק נִסתָר}}).

==Origins==
The source is the [[Talmud]] itself, explained as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a mystical concept, the number 36 is even more intriguing. It is said that at all times there are 36 special people in the world, and that were it not for them, all of them, if even one of them was missing, the world would come to an end. The two Hebrew letters for 36 are the ''lamed'', which is 30, and the ''vav'', which is 6. Therefore, these 36 are referred to as the ''Lamed-Vav Tzadikim''. This widely-held belief, this most unusual Jewish concept is based on a Talmudic statement to the effect that in every generation 36 righteous "greet the [[Shekhinah]]", the Divine Presence (Tractate Sanhedrin 97b; Tractate Sukkah 45b).&lt;ref name="Zwerin_YKKN02"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.americanet.com/Sinai/resources/sermons/Zwerin_YKKN02.html|title = The 36 - Who Are They? |last = Zwerin|first = Rabbi Raymond A.|date = September 15, 2002 |publisher = americanet.com|accessdate = 3 August 2010|location = Temple Sinai, Denver|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030118221508/http://americanet.com/Sinai/resources/sermons/Zwerin_YKKN02.html|archivedate = January 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Their purpose==

Mystical [[Hasidic Judaism]] as well as other segments of [[Judaism]] believe that there exist 36 righteous people whose role in life is to justify the purpose of humankind in the eyes of God. Jewish tradition holds that their identities are unknown to each other and that, if one of them comes to a realization of their true purpose, they would never admit it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Lamed-Vav Tzaddikim'' are also called the ''Nistarim'' ("concealed ones"). In our folk tales, they emerge from their self-imposed concealment and, by the mystic powers, which they possess, they succeed in averting the threatened disasters of a people persecuted by the enemies that surround them. They return to their anonymity as soon as their task is accomplished, 'concealing' themselves once again in a Jewish community wherein they are relatively unknown. The ''lamed-vavniks'', scattered as they are throughout the [[Diaspora]], have no acquaintance with one another. On very rare occasions, one of them is 'discovered' by accident, in which case the secret of their identity must not be disclosed. The lamed-vavniks do not themselves know that they are one of the 36. In fact, tradition has it that should a person claim to be one of the 36, that is proof positive that they are certainly not one. Since the 36 are each exemplars of ''anavah'', ("humility"), having such a virtue would preclude against one’s self-proclamation of being among the special righteous. The 36 are simply too humble to believe that they are one of the 36.&lt;ref name="Zwerin_YKKN02"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Lamedvavniks''==

''Lamedvavnik'' ({{lang-yi|לאַמעדוואָווניק}}), is the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] term for one of the 36 humble righteous ones or ''[[Tzadik]]im'' mentioned in [[kabbalah]] or Jewish mysticism. According to this teaching, at any given time there are at least 36 holy persons in the world who are ''Tzadikim''. These holy people are hidden; i.e., nobody knows who they are. According to some versions of the story, they themselves may not know who they are. For the sake of these 36 hidden saints, God preserves the world even if the rest of humanity has degenerated to the level of total barbarism. This is similar to the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], where God told [[Abraham]] that he would spare the city of Sodom if there was a quorum of at least 10 righteous men. Since nobody knows who the ''Lamedvavniks'' are, not even themselves, every Jew should act ''as if'' he or she might be one of them; i.e., lead a holy and humble life and pray for the sake of fellow human beings. It is also said that one of these 36 could potentially be the [[Jewish Messiah]] if the world is ready for them to reveal themselves. Otherwise, they live and die as an ordinary person. Whether the person knows they are the potential Messiah is debated.

The term ''lamedvavnik'' is derived from the Hebrew letters ''Lamed'' (L) and ''Vav'' (V), whose numerical value (see [[Gematria]]) adds up to 36. The "nik" at the end is a [[Russian language|Russian]] or Yiddish suffix indicating "a person who..." (As in "[[Beatnik]]"; in English, this would be something like calling them "The Thirty-Six'''ers'''".) The number 36 is twice 18. In [[gematria]] (a form of Jewish [[numerology]]), the number 18 stands for "life", because the Hebrew letters that spell [[chai (symbol)|''chai'']], meaning "living", add up to 18. Because 36 = 2×18, it represents "two lives".

In some Hasidic stories, disciples consider their [[Rebbe]]s and other religious figures to be among the ''Lamedvavniks''. It is also possible for a ''Lamedvavnik'' to reveal themselves as such, although that rarely happens—a ''Lamedvavnik'''s status as an exemplar of humility would preclude it. More often, it is the disciples who speculate.

These beliefs are articulated in the works of [[Max Brod]], and some (like [[Jorge Luis Borges]]) believe the concept to have originated in the [[Book of Genesis]] 18:26:
{{quotation|And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Gen|18:26|JPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Notes==
* {{note label|Note1|a|a}} In [[Hebrew numerals]], 30 is ''lamed'' ({{lang-he-n|ל}}), and 6 is ''vav'' ({{lang-he-n|ו}}). The number 36 is written {{lang-he-n|ל"ו}}.

In the second season of ''Touch'', Jake and other people who have special gifts are referred to as members of the 36; throughout the episodes they are exploited for their capabilities and are hunted down by one who believes they hold too much power. The final episode features consideration of the Kabbalah and the mystical roots of the legend of the 36.

'''Victor Henry Anderson''' (May 21, 1917 – September 20, 2001) was an American [[Wicca]]n priest and poet. He was a founding member of the [[Feri Tradition]], a form of the [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] [[new religious movement]] of Wicca which was established in [[California]] during the 1960s.{{efn|In his study of Wicca, [[Pagan studies]] scholar Ethan Doyle White characterized Feri as a "Wiccan" tradition.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=46}} However, some practitioners of modern Pagan Witchcraft restrict the term "Wicca" to [[British Traditional Wicca]], in which case Feri would not be classified as "Wicca"; this exclusionary definition of the term has been described as "unsuitable for academic purposes".{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=161}} Feri has thus been characterized as one form of Wicca which is nevertheless distinct from others, such as British Traditional Wicca, [[Dianic Wicca]], and [[Stregheria]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=162}} }} Much of his poetry was religious in nature, being devoted to Feri deities.

Born in [[Clayton, New Mexico]], to a working-class family, Anderson was left visually impaired during childhood. His family regularly moved around within the United States during his early years, with Anderson claiming that encounters with Mexican, Hawaiian, and Haitian migrants led to him gaining an early understanding of these various cultures' magical practices. The family eventually settled in [[Oregon]], and Anderson later claimed that it was here that he was initiated into a tradition of witchcraft by an African woman. He later claimed that, in 1932, he joined a magico-religious group known as the Harpy Coven which was based in [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]] and which dissolved in the 1940s. According to his description, the group was devoted to a god and goddess, Setan and [[Lilith]], and were influenced by both American folk magic and [[Huna (New Age)|Huna]].

In 1944, he married Cora Cremeans in [[Bend, Oregon]], and, inspired by the writings of English Wiccan [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], they founded the Mahaelani Coven, gaining followers of what became known as the Feri tradition. One of their first initiates was [[Gwydion Pendderwen]], who was a significant influence on the development of the tradition, and who introduced elements from [[Alexandrian Wicca]] in to it. Anderson was a professional [[accordion]] player and wrote poetry for various American Pagan magazines. In 1970, he published his first book of poetry, ''Thorns of the Blood Rose'', which contained devotional religious poetry dedicated to the Goddess; it won the Clover International Poetry Competition Award in 1975. Anderson continued to promote the Feri tradition until his death, at which point April Niino was appointed as the new Grandmaster of the tradition.

Anderson was born on May 21, 1917 at the Buffalo Horn Ranch in [[Clayton, New Mexico]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rabinovitch|1y=2002|1p=7|2a1=Blackthorn|2y=2003|3a1=Kelly|3y=2011|3p=41}} His parents were Hilbart Alexander Anderson (1883–1952) and  Mary Frances Anderson (née Smith, 1886–1973).{{sfnm|1a1=Rabinovitch|1y=2002|1p=7|2p=Wallworth|2y=2015}} Regarding his ethnic ancestry, he later stated that "I am mostly Irish and Spanish with some Native American, including Polynesian".{{sfn|Anderson|Anderson|2012|p=43}} He also claimed that his maternal great-grandmother had been one of the [[Blue Fugates]], a community living in [[Appalachia]] whose skin had a blueish coloration due to [[methemoglobinemia]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=46}} Anderson became almost completely blind when he was two years old, either because of an accident or untreated [[diabetes]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rabinovitch|1y=2002|1p=7|2a1=Blackthorn|2y=2003|3a1=Adler|3y=2006|3p=75|4a1=Clifton|4y=2006|4p=130|5a1=Kelly|5y=2011|5p=41|6a1=Doyle White|6y=2016|6p=46}} By 1920, the family were living in [[Burkburnett]], [[Wichita County, Texas|Wichita County]], [[Texas]], where a sister, Elsie Glenan Anderson, was born in February.{{sfn|Wallworth|2015}} Here, Hilbart worked as a floor worker on some of the many oil rigs in the town.{{sfn|Wallworth|2015}} From there they moved to [[Albuquerque]], New Mexico, where they were recorded as living in the 1923&amp;ndash;24 directory, and where Anderson later claimed that he had made many friends among Mexican migrant children.{{sfn|Wallworth|2015}} Anderson's later wife claimed that he was also instructed in how to use his [[Etheric plane|etheric]] vision by "Mexican Witches" during childhood.{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=30}} The family next moved to [[Olustee, Oklahoma|Olustee]], [[Oklahoma]], where Hilbart's brother resided.{{sfn|Wallworth|2015}}

[[File:Clayton, New Mexico (1904).jpg|350px|left|thumb|Anderson was born in Clayton, New Mexico, in the early 20th century (pictured)]]

After several months in Oklahoma they proceeded to the area around [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]], [[Oregon]], where Anderson claimed to have befriended Hawaiian and Haitian migrant families who were working as fruit pickers.{{sfn|Wallworth|2015}} Anderson often claimed that he had been instructed in the magical practices of Hawaiian [[Kahuna]] and [[Haitian Vodou]],{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=122}} with his later wife referring to him as both "one of the last Kahuna" and "a priest of Voudou".{{sfn|Anderson|1994|pp=20, 21}} He claimed to have been instructed in Vodou by Haitians who were working in southern Oregon.{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}} While living in that state he attended a school for the blind,{{sfnm|1a1=Rabinovitch|1y=2002|1p=7|2a1=Clifton|2y=2006|2p=130}} although despite this was largely self-educated.{{sfn|Rabinovitch|2002|p=7}} The family moved around the state in the coming years; in August 1928 they were living in [[Pinehurst, Oregon|Pinehurst]], where Hilbert was recorded as working as an engineer at a lumber mill in the 1930 census.{{sfn|Wallworth|2015}} By the 1940 census, the family were recorded as living in East Phoenix, Jackson county, Oregon, with Higbert adding that he had also been living there in 1935. At this point, Hilbert was working as a millwright and Mary as a trained nurse.{{sfn|Wallworth|2015}} In 1942 they were recorded as living in Ashland, and it was here that they attended the [[First Baptist Church (Ashland, Oregon)|First Baptist Church]], before relocating to Bend prior to 1944.{{sfn|Wallworth|2015}}

Anderson claimed to be initiated into a tradition of witchcraft in 1926 by a woman "of the Fairy race",{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}} whom he elsewhere referred to as "a priestess from Africa".{{sfn|Wallworth|2015}}
Anderson informed the journalist [[Margot Adler]] that when he was nine years old he encountered a small old woman sitting in the centre of a circle containing brass bowls of herbs. He alleged that he instinctively stripped naked and that she then sexually initiated him into a witchcraft tradition, during which he had a vision of a goddess and a horned god.{{sfnm|1a1=Adler|1y=2006|1p=75|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2pp=47&amp;ndash;48}} After the vision, he claimed that they sat in the circle and she instructed him in the magical use of the various herbs, after which he was washed in butter, oil, and salt, before putting his clothes on and returning home.{{sfn|Adler|2006|pp=75&amp;ndash;76}} The [[Pagan studies]] scholar Ethan Doyle White described this as being "difficult to accept as a literal account", but suggested that Anderson may have undergone a significant spiritual experience with an older woman in 1926, which was subsequently "embellished into the later tale" that he told Adler.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=47}} A woman who knew Anderson, Cornelia Benavidez, later stated that "He says that he became friends with a woman in the circus who was a fire dancer and when she got older worked the stands. She somehow joined the circus in South Africa and made her way to the US. When he first met her she was 60 years old and he was a nine-year-old boy. He knew her for 15 years".{{sfn|Wallworth|2015}} Researcher WIlliam Wallworth provided potential supporting evidence for this claim when he noted that a number of the circuses that performed in Oregon during the 1920s and 1930s had Africans in their travelling retinues.{{sfnm|1a1=Wallworth|1y=2015|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=205}}

===The Harpy Coven: 1932&amp;ndash;1943===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="According to the picture ascertained by Voigt and supplemented by an open letter issued by Victor in 1991, the [Harpy] coven eclectically mixed American folk magic with [[Huna (New Age)|Huna]] &amp;ndash; a [[New Thought]] philosophy partly based in traditional Hawaiian religion &amp;ndash; and venerated a god known as Setan as well as a goddess known as Lilith in both indoor and outdoor rituals organized according to the phases of the moon."|source=— Religious studies scholar Ethan Doyle White{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=47}} }}

Anderson claimed that in 1932 he was initiated into a witchcraft group in Ashland that he called the Harpy Coven,{{sfnm|1a1=Kelly|1y=2007|1p=49|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=47}} although remains the only source testifying to the group's existence.{{sfn|Clifton|2006|p=129}} Research into the coven was later conducted by Valerie Voigt, the coordinator of the Pagan, Occult, and Witchcraft Special Interest Group of the United States branch of [[Mensa International|Mensa]], who was also one of Anderson's students and who asked him about the group.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelly|1y=1991|1p=21|2a1=Kelly|2y=2011|2p=42|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=47}} According to her claims, the group were led by two figures, known as Maybelle "Cardea" Warren and Jerome Warren,{{sfnm|1a1=Kelly|1y=1991|1p=21|2a1=Kelly|2y=2007|2p=50|3a1=Kelly|3y=2011|3p=42}} with other members being Jim Murdoch, Patricia Fern, Tom C. ("Arven"), and Ruth D., the latter of whom was a preacher's wife.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelly|1y=1991|1p=21|2a1=Kelly|2y=2007|2p=50|3a1=Kelly|3y=2011|3p=42}} As related by Voigt, most of them had been immigrants from the Southern states, mainly from [[Alabama]].{{sfn|Kelly|2011|p=42}}

According to Voigt, the coven placed an emphasis on practical magic rather than worship, theology, ethics, or ritual, and were eclectic in their practices, mixing [[Huna (New Age)|Huna]] with forms of American folk magic.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelly|1y=1991|1p=21|2a1=Kelly|2y=2007|2p=50|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=47}} She noted that they did not worship a goddess but held to a belief in a god who was opposed to the God of Christianity.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelly|1y=1991|1p=22|2a1=Kelly|2y=2007|2p=50}} Moreover she claimed that they met together for both outdoor and indoor meetings, according to the phases of the moon.{{sfn|Kelly|2011|p=42}} According to Voigt's account, Anderson also claimed that on occasion, the coven used a naked woman as their [[altar]],{{sfn|Kelly|2011|p=42}} and that the group disbanded after [[World War II]] broke out.{{sfn|Kelly|2011|p=43}}

After the Pagan studies scholar [[Aidan A. Kelly]] published a summary of Voigt's research, Anderson released an open letter dated to August 21, 1991, refuting many of Kelly's claims and referring to it as "the stupid drivel of those who have only a shallow grasp of their alleged research."{{sfn|Anderson|1991}} He stated that contrary to Kelly's assertions, the Harpy Coven had worshiped a goddess, who was known as [[Lilith]], and that "we did not think of her as merely the Goddess, but as God Herself".{{sfn|Anderson|1991}}
He added that the coven also venerated a consort of the Goddess, who was known as Setan, but "although the Goddess tells us that away from the sweet influence of her love, he is the most terrible of all spirits, he is not the fallen angel or 'Satan' of Christianity or Islam".{{sfn|Anderson|1991}} Kelly later stated that the Harpy Coven might "have been self-trained or may have descended from an earlier person or group".{{sfn|Kelly|2011|p=42}}

==Later life: 1944&amp;ndash;2001==

Anderson met Cora Ann Cremeans in [[Bend, Oregon]], in 1944; they married three days later, on 3 May, claiming that they had encountered each other before in the [[astral projection|astral]] realm.{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1994|1p=1|2a1=Rabinovitch|2y=2002|2p=7|3a1=Blackthorn|3y=2003|4a1=Doyle White|4y=2016|4p=47}} Born in [[Nyota, Alabama]], in January 1915, Cora had been exposed to folk magical practices from childhood;{{sfnm|1a1=Blackthorn|1y=2003|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=47}} reputedly, her Irish grandfather was a "root doctor" who was known among locals as the "[[druid]]".{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}} The Andersons claimed that one of their first acts after their marriage was the erection of an [[altar]].{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}} The following year, a son was born, and they named him Victor Elon, with the latter being the Hebrew word for [[oak]]; Cora claimed that she had received the name in a dream.{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1994|1p=2|2a1=Blackthorn|2y=2003|4a1=Doyle White|4y=2016|4p=47}} After the birth, a ritual was held to dedicate the infant to the Goddess.{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=2}} In 1948, the family moved to [[Niles, California]], later that year purchasing a home in [[San Leandro]].{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1994|1p=3|2a1=Blackthorn|2y=2003|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=47}} There, Anderson became a member of the Alameda Lodge of the [[Fraternal Order of Eagles]], and he subsequently remained so for forty years.{{sfn|Schutte|2002}} Victor earned his living as a musician, playing the [[accordion]] at events,{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1994|1p=1|2a1=Rabinovitch|2y=2002|2pp=7&amp;ndash;8|3a1=Blackthorn|3y=2003}} while Cora worked as a hospital cook.{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}} It has been claimed that Anderson could speak Hawaiian, Spanish, Creole, Greek, Italian, and Gothic.{{sfn|Rabinovitch|2002|p=7}}

In the mid-1950s Victor and Cora read ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'', a 1954 book by English Wiccan [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]],{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}} with Cora claiming that Victor corresponded with Gardner for a time.{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=4}} The Pagan studies scholar [[Chas S. Clifton]] has suggested that the Andersons used Gardner's work as a "style guide" for the development of their own tradition of modern Pagan witchcraft.{{sfn|Clifton|2006|p=132}} Similarly, Kelly stated that the Andersons' tradition "began to more and more resemble that of the Gardnerians" as the couple learned more about the latter, adopting elements from it.{{sfn|Kelly|2011|p=43}}
Anderson was in correspondence with the Italian-American Wiccan [[Leo Martello]], who encouraged Anderson to found his own coven.{{sfnm|1a1=Blackthorn|1y=2003|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=47}} Circa 1960, the Andersons founded a coven, naming it Mahaelani, after the Hawaiian word for the full moon.{{sfnm|1a1=Blackthorn|1y=2003|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=47}} Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Andersons initiated a number of individuals into the coven.{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}} One of these was [[Gwydion Pendderwen]], a friend of their son who shared their interest in [[Western esotericism|the esoteric]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blackthorn|1y=2003|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=47}} Pendderwen contributed to the development of what came to be known as the Feri tradition, with some members of the lineage viewing him as its co-founder.{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}} Pendderwen noted that he had first met the family when, aged thirteen, he got into a fight with Victor Elon, although the two later became friends.{{sfn|Clifton|2006|p=130}} Pendderwen was particularly influenced by [[Welsh mythology]], and on a visit to Britain he spent time with the [[Alexandrian Wicca]]ns [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] and [[Stewart Farrar]], subsequently introducing various Alexandrian elements into Feri Wicca.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=47}} In the early 1970s, the Andersons established a new coven with Pendderwen and his initiate, [[Alison Harlow]].{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}} After Pendderwen married, his wife also joined this coven, although it disbanded in 1974.{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}}

===Anderson's teaching===

Over the next four decades, the Andersons would initiate between twenty-five and thirty people into their tradition.{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}}
Anderson has been described as one of the "founding teachers" and the "seminal voice" of the Feri tradition,{{sfn|Rabinovitch|2002|p=7}} although &amp;ndash; according to Feri initiate Storm Faerywolf &amp;ndash; he preferred to refer to himself as "Grand Master and a fairy chief".{{sfn|Faerywolf|2012}} The original word that the Andersons used for their tradition was ''Vicia'', "pronounced as in Italian."{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1994|1pp=4&amp;ndash;5|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=48}} She added that "the name Fairy became accidentally attached to our tradition because Victor so often mentioned that word in speaking of nature spirits and Celtic magic".{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1994|1p=6|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=48}} Early initiates alternately spelled the name of the tradition as ''Fairy'', ''Faery'', or ''Faerie'', although Anderson began using the spelling ''Feri'' during the 1990s to differentiate it from other witchcraft traditions of the same name; not all practitioners followed his example.{{sfnm|1a1=Blackthorn|1y=2003|2a1=Faerywolf|2y=2012|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=48}} Cora claimed that ''Feri'' was the word's original spelling, adding that it meant "the things of magic".{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=5}} Anderson also referred to his form of Wicca as the ''Pictish'' tradition.{{sfn|Anderson|Anderson|2012|p=4}} In their writing, the Andersons mixed terminology adopted from Huna, Gardnerian Wicca, and Voodoo, believing that all reflected the same underlying magico-religious tradition.{{sfn|Clifton|2006|p=131}} It drew heavily upon the [[Huna (New Age)|huna]] system developed by [[Max Freedom Long]].{{sfn|Clifton|2006|pp=130&amp;ndash;131}} According to one Feri initiate, Corvia Blackthorn:

:"The Andersons' teaching method was very informal. There were no classes in an academic sense, only conversations and the occasional ritual, usually followed by a home-cooked meal. Discussions with Victor were non-linear and overflowing with information. Someone once aptly remarked that talking to Victor was like to trying to drink from a fire hose. Often the connecting threads and underlying patterns in the information didn't become apparent until later on. There was also a non-verbal component to Victor's teaching. He was a true shaman, and had the ability to shift the consciousness of his students on a level well below the surface of conversation."{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}}

According to Kelly:

:"Studying with Victor presented some unusual problems. He demanded as much respect as any working-class grandfather might. One could ask for clarification, but to even hint that one disagreed with him, or worse yet, to contradict him, would result in an immediate and permanent order to leave. One was tempted to ask such forbidden questions because Victor lived in mythic time and was totally uninterested in other people's concepts of logic or consistency&amp;nbsp;... Another student told me that when Victor read a new book and believed it was true, then he considered it to have always been true and would rethink his history accordingly."{{sfnm|1a1=Kelly|1y=2011|1p=41|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=48}}

According to one initiate, Jim Schuette, Anderson was "a taskmaster. He took pride in testing his students."{{sfn|Schuette|2012|p=vii}}
One of those initiated into the Anderson's Feri tradition was [[Starhawk]],{{sfnm|1a1=Adler|1y=2006|1p=124|2a1=Berger|2y=2005|2p=38|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=60}} who incorporated ideas from the Feri tradition when creating [[Reclaiming]].{{sfnm|Adler|2006|p=122|2a1=Berger|2y=2005|2pp=48&amp;ndash;49}} She also included aspects from it in her 1979 book, ''[[The Spiral Dance]]'', including mention of the Iron and Pearl Pentagram and the three souls, all of which originated within Feri Wicca.{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}}
Another prominent initiate was Gabriel Carillo (Caradoc ap Cador), who in the late 1970s developed a written body of Feri teachings, and began offering paid classes in the tradition in the 1980s, generating the Bloodrose lineage; doing so generated controversy among Feri initiates, with critics believing that it was morally wrong to charge for teaching.{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}}

===Poetry and final years===

{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=
:"To Triple Mari of the moon we pray
:And offer our devotions in the night,
:For broken hearts who dare not dream by day
:Shall find a refuge when Her healing light
:Illuminates the city of our sins."|source="Mari of the Moon", poem by Anderson.{{sfn|Anderson|2013|p=55}}}}

In 1970 Anderson privately published ''Thorns of the Blood Rose'', which contained poems that he had authored over the previous 25 years.{{sfnm|1a1=Rabinovitch|1y=2002|1p=7|2a1=Blackthorn|2y=2003|3a1=Clifton|3y=2006|3p=131}} He stated that "every poem is a love letter to the Goddess".{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}} Money to publish the book had come from Cora's savings, with sales barely covering the costs of publication, so a second printing was not possible at that time.{{sfn|Pendderwen|2013|p=vi}}
In 1975, this book received the Clover International Poetry Competition Award,{{sfn|Schutte|2002}} and in 1980 it was republished by Pendderwen, who also put some of Anderson's poems to music for his own 1975 album, ''Songs for the Old Religion''.{{sfn|Clifton|2006|p=131}} Anderson also contributed work to Pagan magazines like ''Witch Eye'', ''Green Egg'', and ''Nemeton''.{{sfn|Schutte|2002}} Anderson had assembled a group of poems to be published as a second book, released posthumously as ''Lilith's Garden'' in 2005.{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}}

To honor her fiftieth wedding anniversary, in 1994 Cora authored a book titled ''Fifty Years in the Feri Tradition'', deeming it a tribute to her husband.{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=1}} It has been termed "the definitive written work on Feri thealogy and thought".{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}} In 1998, Cora suffered a stroke and was left largely bedridden by its effects.{{sfn|Schuette|2012|p=viii}}

At the time of his death, he was still running a coven, which was known as Nostos or Blue Circle.{{sfn|Rabinovitch|2002|p=7}} He died at his home on September 20, 2001.{{sfn|Schutte|2002}} He was survived by his wife, son, and various grandchildren and great-grandchildren.{{sfnm|1a1=Schutte|1y=2002|2a1=Rabinovitch|2y=2002|2p=8}} Cora then appointed a woman named Anaar, or April Niino, to be the new Grandmaster of the Feri tradition in summer 2003.{{sfnm|1a1=Faerywolf|1y=2012|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=48}} The tradition itself survived, with various publications appearing that discussed the practice of magic from a Feri perspective.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=48}}

==Teachings==

{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote="Victor has been accused of making up the pantheon of Feri Gods, Guardians and spirits. He has told everyone again and again that he did not learn all he knows from others verbatim. He certainly did learn much from the people of his tradition, but he is a shaman and priest in his own right. I have personally witnessed his communication with our Gods".|source=Cora Anderson, 1994.{{sfn|Anderson|1994|pp=19&amp;ndash;20}}}}

Anderson's Feri Wicca tradition theistically revolved around a Goddess, who was named ''Mari'' after [[Mari (goddess)|the Basque folkloric character]].{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1a2=Anderson|1y=2012|1p=9|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=47}} In Feri theology, Mari was accompanied by a male consort, a [[Horned God]] named Krom.{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1a2=Anderson|1y=2012|1p=9|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=47}} Krom was also viewed as a union of two separate entities, the Divine Twins.{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1994|1p=7|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=48}} Cora claimed that the Goddess had created these Twins, "not because she had to have male help, but because in her divine lust she desired them".{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=8}}
According to Anderson, the name ''Mari'' meant "mother of water",{{sfn|Anderson|Anderson|2012|p=48}} and he described both Mari and Krom as having been the deity names of "the tiny dark aborigines of Scotland, Ireland, and the ancient British Isles".{{sfn|Anderson|Anderson|2012|p=41}} The God was also referred to as ''[[Melek Taus]]''.{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=8}} He stressed the view that these deities were real entities, rather than [[Jungian archetypes]], the latter being a view that had been espoused by other Pagans.{{sfn|Anderson|Anderson|2012|p=53}}

Systems of morality in Feri revolved largely around the idea of ''[[kala (Hawaiian concept)|kala]]''; Cora stated that this term was borrowed from the [[Hawaiian language]] and that it meant "keep[ing] oneself clean and bright and free from complexes within and without".{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=113}}
Cora stated that the Feri tradition had "a code of honor and sexual morality which is as tough and demanding as the [[Bushido]] of Japan and of [[Shinto]]".{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=9}} She added that while Christian missionaries would understand Feri as a "sex cult", "we do not behave like a bunch of slavering mad dogs in heat".{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=11}} Initiation into Feri was a sexual act, and according to Cora "in initiation you literally marry the Goddess, her dual consort and the Gods, whether you are male or female".{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1994|1p=13|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=101}} It involved a male priest giving the female initiate the names of the God and Goddess upon orgasm.{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=12}} If the female initiate was already betrothed to another, or did otherwise not wish to have intercourse with the priest, then a ritual known as the Intentions of the Heart took place. In this, her next sexual act with another person would be considered her initiation.{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1994|1pp=12&amp;ndash;13|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=103}} When a female initiated a male, there was a similarly sexual component although according to Cora, "there are some important differences".{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1994|1p=13|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=103}}

The Andersons taught that there were three parts of the [[soul]],{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1994|1p=15|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=146}} with Doyle White believing that they had adopted this belief from those of Hawaii.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|pp=48, 146}} Cora stated that the first part of the soul inhabited "the etheric body or double", surrounding and penetrating the physical body, extending about 2&amp;nbsp;cm from human flesh and colored either "a misty blue-gray" or "a lovely electric pink".{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=16}} According to her, the second part of the soul inhabited the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] and extended 8 to 9 inches from the physical body.{{sfn|Anderson|1994|pp=17&amp;ndash;18}} She believed that the third part of the soul was "the Godself" and lived in the top of the aura, appearing as a blue, white or gold ball of light.{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=18}} The Andersons also expressed a belief in [[reincarnation]], believing that the allocation of one's future births were organized by [[karma]].{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=44}} They taught that between incarnations, a soul could travel to one of nine etheric globes surrounding the Earth,{{sfn|Anderson|1994|pp=51&amp;ndash;52}} in which existed "well-defined classes of nature spirits" which included [[gnome]]s, [[sylph]]s, [[undine]]s, and [[Salamanders in folklore and legend|salamanders]].{{sfn|Anderson|1994|pp=57&amp;ndash;61}}

Cora described Feri as the "direct survival of old Stone Age religion",{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1994|1p=12|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=82}} reflecting a trend within the Wiccan community for retaining faith in the [[witch-cult hypothesis]] long after it was academically discredited by historians.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=82}} The Andersons believed that the Witchcraft religion had emerged in Africa and been spread throughout the world, believing that Feri Wicca was essentially the same as [[Sami shamanism|Sami indigenous religion]], Voudou, and [[Santeria]].{{sfn|Anderson|1994|pp=26&amp;ndash;28}} She believed that the ritual tools of "the Craft" were "very much alike throughout the world in both time and place".{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=21}} She listed the ritual tools as an [[athame]] "to raise or focus power", a binding cord for use in "ritual liberation and unbinding", as well as a [[scourge]] "to raise power", although the latter was never used to whip human beings.{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1994|1p=21|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=48}} A chalice is used in rituals, symbolizing "the yoni female receptacle of the life force", with an accompanying stone or wax phallus which is sometimes dipped into the chalice during rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1994|1p=22|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=48}} A stone or wooden egg "honors the cosmic egg which God held in her womb".{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1994|1p=23|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=48}} Cora stated that in their rituals "power is raised and used in magic operations for the good of our human race, our ecology, or for necessary martial purposes".{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=25}}

According to Adler, Anderson had "a very poetic way of looking at the world".{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=122}} Alison Harlow had informed her that Anderson's claims about his origins often changed,{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=122}} with Doyle White commenting that "Anderson believed that the telling of spiritual 'truths' through stories was more important than factual accounts of the past".{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=47}}
Anderson described Feri witchcraft as "a devotional science", and his wife called him "an [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] of the occult".{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}} Cora claimed that the couple were "scientists in the truest sense".{{sfn|Anderson|1994|p=19}}
Adler noted that some of the "hallmarks" of the Feri tradition were its "shamanic practices and sexual mysticism".{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=122}} It only involved one initiation.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=123}} There is no set book of liturgy in the tradition, with teachings being passed down orally.{{sfn|Blackthorn|2003}}
Practitioner Storm Faerywolf noted that "the Feri tradition is less about specific practices and more about energetic experience".{{sfn|Faerywolf|2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5774">'''Vladimir Slepian''', a.k.a. '''Eric Pid''' ({{lang-ru|Владимир Слепян / Эрик Пид}}; 1930 – 7 July 1998) is a [[France|French]] artist and writer of [[Russia]]n-[[Jew]]ish origin.

==Biography==
Son of a repressed and executed Soviet functionary, Vladimir Slepian was born in [[Prague]] and resided in [[Leningrad]] before moving to [[Moscow]]. He began his university studies in mathematics, continuing as a student of fine art. In 1956 Slepian moved to Moscow. He attended the Picasso exhibition at the [[Pushkin Museum]] and presented his paintings to [[David Burliuk]], who was then staying at [[Hotel Moskva (Moscow)|Hotel Moskva]]. Burliuk inspired Slepian to look towards the way [[Jackson Pollock]] deposited paint on canvas with broad, lunging, spontaneous gestures. Slepian’s style evolved towards [[happening]] and [[performance art]]. He devoted several years to [[action painting]]. On one occasion, Slepian conducted a séance of simultaneous painting in collaboration with [[Yuri Zlotnikov]]. They suspended a bedsheet in the middle of a room and each of them painted one side of it whilst following the actions of his partner on the other side through the translucent fabric. Slepian created abstract paintings using a gas torch and paint dispensed out of a pump. He is said to have worked on a canvas a few kilometers long, by pouring paint on it from a truck. Slepian also made a pilgrimage to [[Nazım Hikmet]], who assured him and his friends that modern art will prevail over political oppression. In 1957 Paris' Right Bank Galerie Daniel Cordier mounted an anonymous exhibition of paintings by Vladimir Slepian, smuggled out of Moscow by its owner.

Vladimir Slepian emigrated to [[France]] in 1958, by way of [[Poland]]. In 1960 he conducted a performance of “transfinite painting” ("трансфинитная живопись") in Paris. Slepian sprinted along a roll of paper a hundred meters long, depositing paint in a manner that recalled calligraphy. Slepian competed with [[Georges Mathieu]], by creating a picture in ninety seconds. He is said to have turned a road into an action painting by throwing paint onto it whilst riding a motorcycle. In 1963, Slepian gave up painting, resolving to concentrate on writing. He founded a successful translation bureau, explaining his ambition as using his intelligence to put others to work for his benefit, whilst enjoying idleness. His business operated successfully until its manager quit in a protest against Slepian’s despotism.

In his only published French text, a short story ''Fils de chien'', Vladimir Slepian writes of a man who decides to become a dog. He transforms himself one limb and one organ at a time, mapping the effects of the canine body across a human form in a kind of diagramming. Since dogs are quadrupeds, he ties shoes to his hands and feet. When his paws prevent him from lacing the fourth shoe, he uses his mouth, which becomes a dog's snout. This metamorphosis almost succeeds, until the hero comes to the dog’s tail, for which he can find no analogue among human limbs. For him to involve his sexual organ in this transmogrification would tear him away from the society that he has begun to flee. Who would he be, if his identity could not be inferred from his anatomy? The story ends with a descent into childhood memories of the protagonist's mother. It appeared in n° 7 of the ''[[Revue Minuit]]'' alongside texts by [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Robert Pinget]], and [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]]. It served as inspiration for discussion by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]''.

Several years later, Vladimir Slepian renamed himself Eric Pid. He explained his new French name as an anagram of the blind king Oedipus, alluding to blindness at the etymological origins of his Russian family name. In his later years, Slepian succeeded at having his dramatic text staged as an interpolation in ''[[A quand Agamemnon ?]]'', an adaptation of [[Aeschylus]]’ ''[[Agamemnon]]'' by Philippe Brunet and Demodocos, a band of young artists specialized in classical theatre, performed in French, Latin and/or ancient Greek. He went around Paris, distributing framed photographs of this performance for wall display at restaurants. On 7 July 1998, Slepian collapsed on a sidewalk at [[Saint-Germain des Prés]]. The cause of his death is variously reported as [[hunger]] and a [[Myocardial infarction|cardiac crisis]]. He was buried as an [[indigent]], at the state’s expense.

Vladimir Slepian’s life served as inspiration for Viktor Atemian, the protagonist of 2007 feature film ''L’Homme qui marche'' by [[Aurélia Georges]].

The film released worldwide on 15 August 2007. Upon release, the film was a blockbuster at the box office .these was the hat trick hit of this combination of [[N. T. Rama Rao Jr.|Jr.Ntr]] and [[S. S. Rajamouli|SS.Rajamouli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatandhra.com/viewnews.php?id=2154&amp;cat=1&amp;scat=4|title=Box-Office: 'Yamadonga' Topped and Rest Dropped|publisher=greatandhra|accessdate=19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was also later dubbed into Hindi as ''Lok Parlok'' in 2008.

==Plot==
Raja ([[Jr. NTR]]), an orphan boy, is a thief. Mahi ([[Priyamani]]), young girl, falls in love with him. Raja manipulates her by gaining her sympathy. She gives him a necklace, which he throws away because it is worthless; however, it always comes back to him. Ten years later, Mahi's family treats her like a slave while they enjoy the money her grandfather left behind. Mahi waits for her "prince" to come rescue her. Raja is still a conman, but when he enters into debt of Dhanalakshmi ([[Mamta Mohandas]]), a pretty not-so-innocent lender, he flees.  Meanwhile, Mahi's family want Mahi out of the way so they can inherit all of her money.  They hire someone to kill her, only to find out that in the event of Mahi's death, all the money goes to charity. Raja reaches Yamaloka. He creates confusion in Yamaloka by stealing the Yamapasam since one in possession of Yamapasam becomes the King of Hell. Raja promises festivals and parties and to make Hell better than Heaven. Yama contests his claim. Narada ([[Naresh (actor)|Naresh]]) enters the scene and proposes an election. Both Yama and Raja agree. Yama, along with Chitragupta ([[Brahmanandam]]), tries to get the Yamapasam, but fails. Raja wins the elections; however, Yama angrily calls him a human. Raja decides to use the Yamapasam to make Yama a human; however, the plan backfires when Yama ends up with the Yamapasam.  After regaining power, Yama sends Raja back to earth. Raja finds out the cruelty that Mahi has suffered and decides to fight back against her cruel family.  Raja steals a whip and thrashes her family with it, forcing them to become servants. Raja gets drunk and insults Yama again. This time, Yama decides that he and Chitragupta will enter Bhulokam (Earth). Yama disguises himself as Dhanalakshmi, and Chitragupta acts like her father. Yama attempts to create havoc in Raja's life. Raja finds out that Yama is on earth and decides to cleverly fight back. Soon, Raja finds himself fighting against the people who originally killed him. Yama sends his death whip after him and Raja tries to run from it. Soon, Raja and Yama meet face to face in an abandoned temple. Yama is there to collect Raja's soul. Raja begs for a few more minutes of life and apologizes to Yama for his sins and all he has said and done. Yama becomes sympathetic, but regretfully informs him that he cannot call back the death whip. Raja fights his enemies and is close to death, when suddenly, the chain that followed him his whole life was revealed to have been blessed by Lord Vishnu himself, and it saves Raja's life. Raja and Mahi decide to live together and get married. The movie ends with Yama being caught by his wife ([[Kushboo]]).

[[Oneindia.in]] described as "The film is a visual treat for all ages and classes. Rajamouli has done an excellent job molding NTR Jr's character in the film much like his grandfather's and also for bringing NTR back on the screen in an animated form. NTR Jr's overall performance and his dialogue delivery are a joy to watch. Mohanbabu playing 'Yama' once again proved to be the versatile actor that he is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/telugu/reviews/2007/yamadonga-review-160807-1.html|title=Yamadonga – Review|publisher=[[Oneindia.in]]|accessdate=16 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sify]] gave an "average" verdict explained "This socio-fantasy film works, thanks to the new look of NTR and enigmatic performance of Mohan Babu. The songs and background score of MM Keeravani, the technical aspects and entertainer quotient in the first half make the film watchable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/yamadonga-review-telugu-14510898.html|title=Yamadonga Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; jeevi of [http://www.idlebrain.com idlebrain] gave 3/5 stars said "First half of the film is entertaining. The second half should have been better. The plus points of the film are Mohan Babu, NTR, sets, cinematography and music. On the flip side, the screenplay of the film is not gripping in second half (after NTR returns to earth). The runtime of the film is pretty lengthy (3.05 hours)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/movie/archive/mr-yamadonga.html|title=Yamadonga|publisher=idlebrain|accessdate=15 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===

It completed a 100-day run in 92 centres and become one of the top Telugu films of the 2007 and gave NTR Jr. a massive success after his previous blockbuster Simhadri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/dec/19sli3.htm|title=Top five Telugu films of 2007|publisher=Rediff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word '''Yid''' ({{IPAc-en|'|j|i:|d}}; {{lang-yi|ייִד}}){{clarify|date=November 2010}} is a [[slang]] [[Jewish ethnonym]] of [[Yiddish]] origin. Its usage may be controversial in modern [[English language]]. It is not usually considered offensive when pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|iː|d}} (rhyming with ''deed''), the way Yiddish speakers say it, though some may deem the word offensive nonetheless. When pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɪ|d}} (rhyming with ''did'') by non-Jews, it is commonly intended as a [[pejorative]] term. It is used as a derogatory [[epithet]] by [[antisemitism|antisemites]] along with, and as an alternative to, the English word 'Jew'.&lt;ref name=kpearson&gt;[http://kpearson.faculty.tcnj.edu/Dictionary/yid.htm Kim Pearson's ''Rhetoric of Race''] by Eric Wolarsky. [[The College of New Jersey]]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810143754/http://kpearson.faculty.tcnj.edu/Dictionary/yid.htm |date=2007-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Image:Page from Yiddish-Hebrew-Latin-German dictionary by Elijah Levita.jpg|thumb|250px|A page from [[Elia Levita]]'s [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]-[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]-[[Latin language|Latin]]-[[German language|German]] dictionary (16th century) contains a list of nations, including an entry for Jew: {{lang-he|יְהוּדִי}} {{lang-yi|יוּד}} {{lang-de|Iud}} {{lang-la|Iudaeus}}]]

The term ''Yid'' has its origins in the [[Middle High German]] word ''{{lang|de|Jüde}}'' (the contemporary [[German language|German]] word is ''{{lang|de|Jude}}'').

[[Leo Rosten]] provides the following [[etymology]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;From the [[German language|German]]: Jude: 'Jew.' And 'Jude' is a truncated form of Yehuda, which was the name given to the [[Israelite|Jewish Commonwealth]] in the period of the [[Second Temple]]. That name, in turn, was derived from the name of one of [[Jacob]]'s sons, Yehuda ([[Judah (Bible)|Judah]], in [[English language|English]]), whose descendants constituted one of the [[tribes of Israel]] and who settled in that portion of [[Canaan]] from [[Jerusalem]] south to [[Kadesh-Barnea]] (50 miles south of [[Beersheba]]) and from [[Jericho]] westwards to the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Leo Rosten]]: ''[[The Joys of Yiddish]]'', 1968. Cited in [http://kpearson.faculty.tcnj.edu/Dictionary/yid.htm Kim Pearson's ''Rhetoric of Race''] by Eric Wolarsky. [[The College of New Jersey]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
The earliest mention of the word ''Yid'' in print was in ''[[The Slang Dictionary]]'' published by [[John Camden Hotten]] in 1874. Hotten noted that "The Jews use these terms very frequently."&lt;ref name=kpearson/&gt;

After [[World War II]], most examples of the word ''Yid'' are found in the writing of Jewish authors. These occurrences are usually either attempts to accurately portray antisemitic speech, or as [[self-deprecation|self-deprecating]] [[Jewish humor]]. In his 1968 bestseller ''[[The Joys of Yiddish]]'', Leo Rosten offers a number of anecdotes from the "[[Borscht Belt]]" to illustrate such usage.&lt;ref name=kpearson/&gt;

==Usage in Yiddish==
In Yiddish, the word "Yid" {{lang-yi|ייד}} is neutral or even complimentary, and in [[Ashkenazi]] Yiddish-speaking circles it is frequently used to mean simply "fellow," "chap," "buddy," "mate," etc., with no expressed emphasis on Jewishness (although this may be implied by the intra-Jewish context). Plural is {{lang|yi|יידן}} {{IPA|[jidn]}}.

In Yiddish, a polite way to address a fellow Jew whose name one does not know is ''Reb Yid,'' meaning "Sir." The Yiddish words ''yidish'' or ''yiddisher'' (from Middle High German ''jüdisch'') is an adjective derived from the noun ''Yid,'' and thus means "[[Jewish]]".

==Usage in European football==
{{main|Tottenham Hotspur F.C.#Support}}

Some Jewish and non-Jewish fans of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.]] adopted "Yid" (or "Yiddo") as a [[nickname]] and "Yiddo, Yiddo!" as a [[battle cry]] and often identify themselves as "Yid Army". While such usage remains controversial, for the majority of Tottenham supporters it is used with pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1244371097227 |title=JPost &amp;#124; French-language news from Israel, the Middle East &amp; the Jewish World |publisher=Fr.jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jewish Tottenham supporters use it with a political consciousness of the club as a bastion against racism and antisemitism. Fans of other clubs use the term as a pejorative because it is perceived that many Tottenham Hotspur fans are Jewish. This following started in the 1890s and 1900s when the club was the team of choice for "East-enders" – including large numbers of Jewish immigrants – who could easily get cheap buses and trams to Tottenham, heading north along the road later designated the A10.  East-end Jews have mostly moved to the north and east London suburbs and Herts and Essex, but support for Tottenham Hotspur continues to run in families (a famous example is [[Alan Sugar]]).  For visiting teams' supporters the Jewish connection continues to be bolstered by the large numbers of – easily identifiable – [[Haredi]] Orthodox Jews living in the South Tottenham and Stamford Hill areas; but in practice there is no evidence of Haredi Jews attending football matches. Nevertheless, it is not necessary to be Haredi to be Jewish, and Spurs still has a strong Jewish fanbase.
