The  '''Accident Towing Services Act 2007''' (the Act) is a law enacted by the Parliament of the [[Victoria (Australia)|State of Victoria]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=Act&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/atsa2007246.txt/cgi-bin/download.cgi/download/au/legis/vic/consol_act/atsa2007246.txt Accident Towing Services Act 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act is the prime [[statute]] [[Regulation|regulating]] the vehicle [[towing]] industry which provides towing and recovery services for light and heavy [[road vehicle]]s across Victoria.  It is predominately founded on [[safety]] and [[consumer protection]] sentiments.  The Act continued economic controls over the industry and contains occupational regulation characteristics.   The style of the underlying regulatory scheme varies in parts and represents a blend which is prescriptive in some parts and performance and process-based in others.

The Accident Towing Services Act was the first dedicated [[statute]] regulating Victoria's towing industry and replaced provisions in the former [[Transport Act 1983]].&lt;ref&gt;This Act has since been renamed.  It has carried the title [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]] since 1 July 2010 by virtue of changes made by the [[Transport Integration Act 2010]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act generally strengthened the scheme of regulation for accident towing activity in Victoria and, at the same time, deregulated trade towing industry controls.  In essence, towing vehicles damaged in a [[road accident]] and the individuals working in that sector are subject to tight controls while trade towing activities such as breakdown towing have few controls.

The Accident Towing Services Act was passed by the [[Victorian Parliament]] on 17 July 2007 and commenced on 1 January 2009.  The Act was developed as part of the [[Transport Legislation Review]] conducted by the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]] and is aimed at promoting the safe, efficient and timely provision of towing and related services particularly following road accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act forms part of the [[transport]] [[policy]] and [[legislation]] framework in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] headed by the [[Transport Integration Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport Integration Act 2010]] - see paragraph (a) in the definition of "transport legislation" in section 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the application of the Accident Towing Services is subject to the overarching transport system vision, transport system objectives and decision-making principles set out in the [[Transport Integration Act]].

The responsible [[Victorian Government]] [[Minister (government)|Minister]] for the Accident Towing Services Act is the Minister for Roads.

== Objectives ==
The stated objective of the Accident Towing Services Act is twofold.  First, the Act seeks to promote the safe, efficient and timely provision of accident towing and related services.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 4(a).&lt;/ref&gt;  Second, the Act seeks to ensure that the persons who provide accident towing services are of appropriate character.

The Act is also aimed at ensuring that the persons in the industry are technically competent to provide accident towing services.  The statute also requires that those persons act with integrity and in a manner that is safe, timely and efficient when providing the services.  Emphasis is also placed on the need for regard to be had to vulnerable persons in recognition of the shock and trauma that typically afflicts persons involved in road accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 4(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outline ==
The scheme in the  Accident Towing Services Act broadly sets economic, occupational and general [[consumer protection]] controls over the accident towing industry in Victoria.

First, the statute enables maximum numbers of accident towing vehicles to be set across the State through licensing controls and also facilitates the orderly allocation of [[tow trucks]] to road accident sites.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Second, the Act sets minimum standards on the character of industry participants and regulates the behaviour of the participants once they enter the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, Parts 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The framework of offences in the Act broadly seeks to give practical effect to the "[[chain of responsibility]]" concept in the accident towing sector.&lt;ref&gt;The [[chain of responsibility]] concept emanated from the heavy vehicle sector in [[Australia]].  The concept has since been taken further  in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and extended in a modified form to the rail safety, [[bus]] safety, [[marine (ocean)|marine]] safety, taxi and accident [[towing]] sectors.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept seeks to identify the industry parties who are in a sufficient position of control over risks, in this case potentially unsafe and unethical conduct following road accidents, and to allocate responsibility through [[law]] accordingly in order to deter and punish those behaviours in the interest of a safe, clean and efficient industry.

The behavioural controls in the Act cover a wide range of activities and practices including the systematic allocation of [[tow trucks]] to accident sites in "controlled areas"&lt;ref&gt;See the section on controlled areas below.&lt;/ref&gt; and conduct at road accident sites and during post accident repair work.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, Part 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme was broadly prompted by [[consumer protection]] sentiment, in particular, the recognition of the vulnerability of road accident victims.  Care was evident during the development of the scheme to maintain and enhance existing character standards in the accident towing sector due to behavioural issues in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in the past including the infiltration of criminal elements into some areas of the industry and resultant "[[predatory towing]]" activities.

=== Summary ===
In broad terms, the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/atsa2007246.txt/cgi-bin/download.cgi/download/au/legis/vic/consol_act/atsa2007246.txt Accident Towing Services Act] regulates the accident towing industry in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] by -

* establishing a licensing scheme for tow trucks which provide accident towing services&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act, Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
* requiring the accreditation of operators of accident towing service businesses and managers of the depots from which accident tow trucks operate&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act,  Part 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* requiring the accreditation of accident tow truck drivers&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act, Part 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
* establishing requirements and protections relating to the storage and repair of motor vehicles following road accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act, Part 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parts ==
The  Accident Towing Services Act is divided into eight parts -  
# Preliminary
# Requirements as to tow trucks
# Industry accreditation
# Driver accreditation
# General accident towing and related operations
# Enforcement
# Codes of Practice
# Miscellaneous

== Coverage ==
The  Accident Towing Services Act regulates the accident towing services sector in Victoria.  The statute defines the sector as the service of operating tow trucks for the purposes of towing vehicles to places following road accidents or towing for the purposes of clearing road accident scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act, section 3, definition of "accident towing service".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Licensing ==

=== Operators ===
Part 4 of the  Accident Towing Services Act establishes a licensing scheme for accident tow trucks.  The Act makes it an offence for a person to operate a tow truck for accident towing purposes unless the person who provides the service has a "regular tow truck licence".&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the person must operate the truck from a depot specified in the licence and must hold a towing operator accreditation.  The tow truck must  be registered and be capable of being used for towing services activity.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drivers ===
It is an offence under the Act for a person to drive an unlicensed accident tow truck or a tow truck that is inacapable of being used in accident towing work (for example, a tow truck cannot be incapable of towing generally or incapable of towing a vehicle which has a gross vehicle mass of less than 4 tonnes&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 8.&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Licensing offences - accident scenes ===
Prohibitions exist in the  Act against tow trucks attending accident scenes unless the vehicle is licensed.  The offence does not apply if the vehicle attends for the purposes of salvage work only and will not therefore be involved in the act of towing the vehicle from the road accident scene.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Issue of licences ===

==== Decision to issue ====
The  Act positions [[VicRoads]] as the prime agency able to issue both regular and heavy accident towing licences.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, Part 2, Division 2.&lt;/ref&gt;   However, authorisation to issue licences must be obtained first from the Minister who is conferred with power by the Act to authorise the issuing of regular tow truck licences for particular areas of the State.  The Minister can only make such an authorisation if she or she considers it to be in the public interest having regard to any increase in the need for tow trucks in the relevant area.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 14(2)(a).&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, the authorisation can be made if the licences are to replace existing licences&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 14(2)(b).&lt;/ref&gt; or exceptional circumstances justify the issue of new licences.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 14(2)(c).&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar tests apply to the Minister's decision about the numbers of heavy tow truck licences which are to be made available.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Special rules apply to the issue of regular and heavy tow truck licences used for the provision of accident towing services on the [[CityLink]] and [[EastLink (Melbourne)|EastLink]] toll roads.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, sections 14 and 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ministerial authorisations for the issue of licences must be published in the Government Gazette and must specify the number of licences to be issued.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Issuing process ====
Management of the tow truck licensing process under the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/atsa2007246.txt/cgi-bin/download.cgi/download/au/legis/vic/consol_act/atsa2007246.txt Act] is the responsibility of [[VicRoads]], Victoria's prime road management and safety agency.  [[VicRoads]] is required to issue a public notice advising of the towing licences to be issued, list the procedures to be followed, and state whether the price is to be determined by fixed price or tender and provide other details.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section  17.&lt;/ref&gt;   Designated procedures apply during the issuing process.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, sections 18 to 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tow truck operation offences ====
Part 2 of the Act provides a number of criminal offences relating to the operation of accident tow trucks. The offences include -

* failure to take care in driving or operating a tow truck including losing or damaging a motor vehicle or its contents&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
* leaving a tow truck standing at a road accident site in a manner or for a time which obstructs the road for an unnecessary period&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
* permitting or allowing a person other than a tow truck driver from travelling in a damaged motor vehicle which is being towed by a tow truck from a road accident scene.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Victoria Police]] and [[VicRoads|VicRoads']] authorised officers are given power under the Act to direct a person to leave a restricted road accident site area (an area within a 500-metre radius of an accident damaged vehicle) if the person is causing an unwarranted obstruction to traffic, hindering efforts to attend to any injured persons or damaged property or is otherwise hindering or obstructing the orderly towing of a motor vehicle from a road accident site.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 41(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  A direction may be given to a tow truck driver, the holder of a tow truck licence or a person engaged in vehicle repair work or persons acting on behalf of those persons.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 41(2) to (4).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an offence to fail to comply with a direction.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 41(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other relevant provisions ====
[[VicRoads]] is empowered under the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/atsa2007246.txt/cgi-bin/download.cgi/download/au/legis/vic/consol_act/atsa2007246.txt Act] to attach conditions to the tow truck licences it issues.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Breach of a condition is an offence.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  A tow truck licence is specified to be the property of the holder of the licence.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 28(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, licence holders are prohibited from assigning or renting the licence to another person.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 28(2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Licences are, however, able to be transferred&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 29.&lt;/ref&gt; to other persons whereupon special procedural requirements apply.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, sections 30 to 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act provides capacity for VicRoads to cancel or suspend tow truck licences if operators fail to comply with licence conditions or do not comply with a provision of the Act or other relevant Acts such as the Road Safety Act 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 32 and 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accreditation ==

=== Industry management ===
Part 3 of the Accident Towing Services Act makes provision for an accreditation scheme for management participants in the accident towing industry.  A person must not conduct an accident towing service business or be the manager of an accident towing depot unless the person holds an accredtitation issued by [[VicRoads]].&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Part 3 contains provisions relating to the mechanics of these schemes including VicRoads' powers to issue accreditation.  The Part also contains a scheme which seeks to regulate character requirements as part of the accreditation process particularly through the specification of a range of criminal offences which, if they form part of an applicant's background, can result in mandatory or discretionary refusal of accreditation by VicRoads.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 66 - 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Part also enables VicRoads to attach conditions to an accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 72.&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition, the Part confers power on the Minister to set service standards to be met by holders of accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  The standards may cover matters such as complaints handling and the provision of information to VicRoads relating to complaints.

The Part also contains power for [[VicRoads]] to take disciplinary action against an accredited person if VicRoads is satisfied that the person has contravened the Act, committed a listed offence, contravened a condition of a tow truck licence or an accreditation or if the action is appropriate having regard to the objective of accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  The disciplinary action that may be taken by VicRoads includes suspension or cancellation of accreditation, a direction that the person must undergo training or at the giving of a warning.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal]] is given power by the Act to review decisions made by VicRoads under Part 3 including in relation to refusal of accreditation and cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, Part 3, Division 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tow truck drivers and trainees ===

==== Drivers ====
Part 4 of the Accident Towing Services Act contains provision for a tow truck driver accreditation scheme.  The scheme is similar to the scheme set out in Part 3 for management participants in the accident towing industry.  For example, it is an offence for a person to drive an accident tow truck or to accompany the driver of an accident tow truck unless the person holds an accreditation issued by [[VicRoads]].&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  Power exists in the Part for VicRoads to suspend a tow truck driver accreditation without a show cause process if VicRoads believes on reasonable grounds that the action is in the [[public interest]].&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trainees ====
Provision is also made under Part 4 of the Act for VicRoads to issue a tow truck driver trainee permit, a permission which enables a person to accompany a tow truck driver for the purposes of being trained as a driver or to gain knowledge of the towing industry.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, Part 4, Division 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other key provisions ==
Part 5 of the Act contains a range of provisions which are integral to the accident towing regulation scheme.

=== Authority to tow ===
A tow truck driver is prohibited from towing a vehicle from a road accident scene unless the driver has obtained an authorisation to tow that vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 142.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strict conditions apply to the issue and carriage of an authority to tow.  The driver is obliged to tow the vehicle to the place specified in the authority.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Offences at accident scenes ===
Conduct at accident scenes is tightly regulated by the Act.  For example, any person at an accident scene or at any time between the time the vehicle is towed from an accident scene and the time when the vehicle is first stored must not tout or solicit for the business of repairing the vehicle or offer or seek to reach an agreement about a quotation or the repair of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 147.&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons are also prohibited from touting or soliciting for the towing or storage of a damaged vehicle at an accident site or attempting to reach an agreement in respect of such matters.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Storage and repair of damaged vehicles ===
The storage and repair of vehicles damaged in road accidents is tightly controlled by the Act.

==== Storage ====
The vehicle must be towed to the place specified in the authority to tow and be stored in a secure area.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 150.&lt;/ref&gt;   Tow truck licence holders are required to provide a written notice stating the charges which apply to the storage of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons are prohibited by the Act from receiving payment to obtain repair work or as payment for hand over of an accident damaged motor vehicle to another person for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Repair ====
The Act also contains a number of obligations on vehicle repairers.  A person must not commence or carry our repair work on an accident damaged motor vehicle without approval in writing.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 153(1).&lt;/ref&gt;   If work commences without authority the person conducting the work is unable to take legal action to commence any sum or charge relating to the work or any quote prepared in relation to the work.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 153(2)(a) and (b).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also gives owners of damaged motor vehicles the benefit of a ''[[Cooling-off period (consumer rights)|cooling off period]]'' in recognition that they may have made an arrangement for repair of the vehicle following an accident without the opportunity to think clearly about the matter due to trauma or shock.   The owner of the vehicle is therefore given three working days after signing an agreement to repair an accident damaged motor vehicle to terminate that agreement&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 154.&lt;/ref&gt; and without the owner being liable for costs.

The Act also makes it clear that the owner of an accident damaged motor vehicle is not liable for repairs to the vehicle which are conducted at a place other than that nominated in the authority to tow.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 155.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, it is an offence for a person in control of the place where an accident damaged motor vehicle was towed to refuse to release a vehicle or to frustrate or obstruct its release.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 156.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is, however, a defence if the vehicle owner authorised work on the vehicle and towing or storage charges are outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 156(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

Special requirements apply to repairers in relation to accident towing services in a controlled area.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, Part 5, Division 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  A repairier cannot begin a quote for repairs without confirming details with the allocation body.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 158.&lt;/ref&gt;   Other paperwork requirements are also set out in the Act in relation to repairs relating to tows in the controlled area.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, sections 159 - 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controlled and self-management areas ==

=== Controlled areas ===
The strictest controls in the Accident Towing Services Act affect the capacity of accident tow  trucks to operate in particular areas apply in relation to "''controlled areas''", basically most of the areas of the cities of [[Melbourne]] and [[Geelong]] where behavioural problems in the industry have been greatest in the past.

[[VicRoads]] is given power under the Act to declare controlled areas for the purposes of the Act&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and to appoint a person or body to act as the allocation body for those areas.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  A licence holder and driver commits an offence if the persons attend an accident scene in a controlled area or tow or attempt to tow a damaged vehicle unless the allocation body has authorised attendance at the accident scene and the towing activity.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each accident tow truck licence entitles the holder of the licence to one place on the roster if a specified depot is attached to the licence.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  A roster entitlement is not able to be transferred to another operator.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-management areas ===
The areas of Victoria outside of the controlled areas are called self-management areas.  Licence holders are unable to attend accidents in self-management areas and conduct tows in those areas unless authorised under the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 51.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[VicRoads]] is given power under the Act to declare self-management areas for the purposes of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enforcement ==
Enforcement-related provisions supporting the Accident Towing Services Act scheme are set out in Part 6 of the Act.  The Act can be enforced by officers of the [[Victoria Police]] and authorised officers appointed by [[VicRoads]].  The enforcement scheme centres on provisions enabling the appointment of authorised officers, the conferral of certain coercive powers and the availability of a range of administrative and court-based sanctions.

=== Key elements ===
The key elements of the enforcement scheme are - 
* power for VicRoads to appoint authorised officers to enforce the Act&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, Part 6, Division 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
* a demerits points scheme applying to industry participants including accredited persons such as licence holders and drivers&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, Part 6, Division 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* power for officers to service infringement notices&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 173.&lt;/ref&gt;
* powers for officers to serve improvement notices&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, Part 6, Division 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* coercive powers such as powers to require name and address details, the capacity to enter and search tow trucks, power to require production of identification, entry or search of premises including without warrant, power to obtain search and power to seize of things including documents, equipment and goods&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, Part 6, Divisions 5 - 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* powers to initiate [[Prosecutor|prosecutions]] for breaches of the Act&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Codes of practice ==
Part 7 of the Act makes provision for the Minister to approve codes of practice for the purpose of providing practical guidance under the Act.  Compliance with a codes of practice can act as a safe harbour for persons in the towing industry although failure to comply with a provision in a code does not create any criminal or civil liability.&lt;ref&gt;Accident Towing Services Act 2007, section 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Miscellaneous ==

== Responsible regulator ==
{{See also|Transport Integration Act}}
The responsible regulator for the application, administration and enforcement of the Accident Towing Services Act in Victoria and therefore for the regulation of the accident towing industry is the Roads Corporation or [[VicRoads]].  VicRoads took over this responsibility from the Victorian Taxi Directorate, a business unit located in the office of the [[Director of Public Transport]] attached to the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]], in late 2006 during the final stages of the development of the Act proposal.  The transfer of responsibility occurred after the creation of a new Ministry of Roads and Ports which separated those portfolios from the former Transport Ministry (a separate Ministry of Public Transport was also created at this time).

== Development ==
{{See also|Transport Legislation Review}}
The development of the proposal for the Accident Towing Services was managed by the former Department of Infrastructure in Victoria.  The successor to the Department of Infrastructure in transport matters was the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]].  The Department managed the project as part of its broader [[Transport Legislation Review]].

The Department held a series of workshops with Victoria's towing industry and issued discussion papers outlining the broad policy features of a proposed new regulatory scheme.  The papers raised a series of concerns about the former towing industry framework and aspects of the industry's performance including concerns about under regulation and over regulation in particular areas.  Comments were requested from [[industry]] parties and other interested stakeholders.  Comments received from [[industry]], [[government]] and other stakeholders resulted in the refinement of the proposal prior to its approval by the Victorian Government and presentation to Parliament as proposed legislation.

Ultimately, the proposals for a new regulatory scheme were introduced to the [[Victorian Parliament]] as proposed [[legislation]] in mid April 2007.

== Parliamentary approval ==

=== Introduction ===
The Accident Towing Services Bill was introduced into the [[lower house]] of the [[Victorian Parliament]], the [[Legislative Assembly]], as the Accident Towing Services Bill.  The responsible [[Minister (government)|Minister]] for the proposal was the then Minister for Roads and Ports, the Hon [[Tim Pallas]] MP.

==== Context ====
The Minister moved the [[second reading]] of the Accident Towing Services on 19 April 2007.  The Minister set the context for the Bill in his speech in support as follows -

::"The Government has reviewed the existing towing services framework a number of times in recent years and has concluded that retaining the existing regulatory framework is essential to address the unique problems in the industry and to protect accident victims and benefit road users. The reviews involved extensive consultation with stakeholders.  Also, over the last two years there has been ongoing consultation with industry stakeholders on a proposal for an improved regulatory framework for the industry and a new stand-alone accident towing services statute. ....the Government is committed to retaining the existing regulatory framework, which has been effective for over 20 years.  Therefore, the substantive provisions of the ... Transport Act 1983 relating to accident towing are largely retained by the Bill, but in an improved and modernised form.&lt;ref name="Hansard, 2007"&gt;[[Parliament of Victoria]], Hansard, [[Legislative Assembly]], 19 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;"

==== Main changes ====
The speech also contained an observation on the main change brought about by the new regulatory scheme -

::"The Bill introduces one important addition to the existing regulatory framework for accident towing -- industry accreditation. This initiative is aimed at improving existing industry performance. A person who wants to undertake a role within the industry either as an accident towing operator, depot manager or tow-truck driver will be required to obtain accreditation from VicRoads to perform the activities associated with that role. The purpose of the accreditation scheme is to provide assurance about a person's ability and credentials to perform that role. It will be an offence to undertake the activities without the appropriate accreditation. An operator will continue to be required to hold a licence for each tow truck being used to operate an accident towing business.&lt;ref name="Hansard, 2007"/&gt;"

==== Strengthening of existing regulation ====
The Minister also made observations about the strengthening of existing regulatory requirements provided for in the Bill -

::"The existing probity requirements in the Transport Act for accident towing licences and tow-truck driver authorities have been transferred to the new accreditation schemes thus ensuring that there is no reduction of these standards in the industry. Accreditation will help provide assurance that accident towing operators and depot managers are of suitable character and can meet service standards for complaints handling and (that) tow-truck drivers are of suitable character and are competent to tow damaged motor vehicles away from crash scenes.&lt;ref name="Hansard, 2007"/&gt;"

==== Responsibilities of industry participants ====
Reflections were contained in the speech about the responsibilities owed by industry participants to vulnerable road accident victims -

::"The roles performed in the accident towing industry are positions of considerable responsibility and the safety, trust and convenience of those involved in road accidents are imperative. The probity check will, for example, help to protect crash victims who are in a vulnerable state and who may get a lift home in a tow truck from the unacceptable risk of falling prey to a driver who has previously committed a serious criminal offence. It will also help protect accident victims from having their motor vehicle or possessions being mistreated at the depot by operators or depot managers.&lt;ref name="Hansard, 2007"/&gt;"

==== Deregulation of the trade towing sector ====
The Minister also commented in the following terms about the deregulation of the trade towing sector provided in the Bill -

::"Finally, the Bill removes the regulation of trade towing, which encompasses breakdown, clear away zones and non-accident tows. This is consistent with the position in other major States. The Government has found that there is no case for regulation of this sector as the trade towing market is already highly competitive and consumers are able to make an informed choice of trade towing services. This can be clearly contrasted with the accident towing services market. Further, licensing of trade towing is currently 'as of right', attracting nominal fees, thus ensuring that there is no capacity for the licensing authority to refuse a licence. Deregulation will remove unnecessary costs to trade towing businesses and the initiative demonstrates again that the government is fully committed to removing excessive red tape and unnecessary regulation on business.&lt;ref name="Hansard, 2007"/&gt; "

==== Connection to policy objectives ====
The Minister commented that -

::"[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is the national leader in best practice regulation. Examples include our ''''Third Wave of National Reform'''' proposal at the [[Council of Australian Governments]] and our ongoing commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on business. The Bill provides further evidence of this, by regulating only to the extent necessary to address market failures in accident towing and to provide wider public benefits such as protecting accident victims and improving road safety and traffic management. It also removes the regulation of trade towing, which is no longer necessary in a competitive market, thus reducing existing industry compliance costs in that sector."

::"The Bill is the most significant initiative in accident towing control since the industry was first regulated. It is also a further essential step in the broader reform and modernisation of transport legislation in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and, in particular, the restructuring and improvement of the Transport Act, using the best contemporary process and [[performance-based regulation]] and compliance techniques. It again demonstrates ... continuing determination to protect vulnerable accident victims and improve road safety and traffic management for all road users by pursuing best-quality reform to correct market failures.&lt;ref name="Hansard, 2007"/&gt;"

==== Conclusion ====
The Minister concluded his speech in support of the Accident Towing Services Bill by observing that -

::""This Bill establishes Victoria's first stand-alone Accident Towing Services Act and provides a modern and secure platform for better performance in the towing industry. It continues and improves on a proven regulatory framework which has brought criminal and undesirable practices in the industry under control, and which has also protected crash victims and helped enable road accidents scenes to be cleared safely and efficiently in the interests of road safety and congestion management.  The Bill also seeks to improve the performance of the industry by introducing a targeted accreditation scheme to ensure that complaints systems are introduced, thereby encouraging accident towing participants to become more focused on providing better customer service. The Bill also enables [[VicRoads]] to determine whether service quality is an issue that should be addressed, and to enforce the regulatory framework more effectively. Accreditation is introduced with minimal compliance costs to the industry and modest increased monitoring costs for Government.

The '''administration of justice''' is the process by which the [[legal system]] of a government is executed. The presumed goal of such administration is to provide [[justice]] for all those accessing the legal system. The phrase is also used commonly to describe a University degree (as in: a BA in Administration of Justice), which can be a prerequisite for a job in law enforcement or government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohlone.edu/instr/adminjustice/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807231503/http://ohlone.edu/instr/adminjustice/ |archivedate=2016-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In ''Attorney General for New South Wales v Love'', the appellant argued that section 24 of the Act 9 Geo 4 c 83 did not have the effect applying the [[Nullum Tempus Act]] (9 Geo 3 c 16) (1768) to [[New South Wales]]. Counsel for the appellant said that ''Whicker v Hume''&lt;ref&gt;Whicker v Hume (1858) 7 HL 124&lt;/ref&gt; decided that section 24 referred not to laws generally, but only to laws as to modes of procedure, and that the Nullum Tempus Act did not deal merely with procedure. The Lord Chancellor said that the Act 9 Geo 4 c 83 ''prima facie'' "applied the Nullum Tempus Act to the Colony in question as much as if it had re-enacted it for that Colony." He then said:

{{Blockquote|Sect. 24 of that Act provides "that all the laws and statutes in force within the realm of England at the passing of this Act" (that is to say, the year 1828) "shall be applied in the administration of justice in the courts of New South Wales," and it is sought by construction to limit the words "all laws and statutes" by introducing into the section the words "having relation to procedure" or some equivalent expression. At least that is the only intelligible mode in which the argument can be supported, because the words which do occur in the section - "in the administration of justice" - would certainly include a limitation of the time within which actions can be brought, and their Lordships are of the opinion that the language of the section cannot be limited so as to exclude the statute, which for the reasons pointed out by the learned judges were and are so important in the administration of justice in the Colony.&lt;ref&gt;Attorney General for New South Wales v Love [1898] AC 679 at 685, [[Privy Council|PC]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Canada==
[[Section 92(14) of the Constitution Act, 1867]], also known as the administration of justice power, grants the provincial legislatures of Canada the authority to legislate on:
:14. The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts.

===Ontario===
Section 1 of the Administration of Justice Act (RSO 1990 c A6) provides:

{{Blockquote|In this Act, "administration of justice" means the provision, maintenance and operation of,
:(a) the courts of justice of the Province of Ontario,
:(b) land registry offices,
:(c) jails, and
:(d) the offices of coroners and Crown Attorneys,
for the performance of their functions, including any functions delegated to such courts, institutions or offices or any official thereof by or under any Act; (“administration de la justice”)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90a06 Digitised copy]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This provision was previously section 1 of the Administration of Justice Act (RSO 1980 c 6),&lt;ref&gt;(1982) 37 Ontario Reports 246 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xj9SAQAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was previously section 1 of Administration of Justice Act (RSO 1970 c 6),&lt;ref&gt;(1995) Ontario Reports 387 and 389 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kEJSAQAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was previously section 1 of Administration of Justice Act 1968 (SO 1968 c 1) (17 Eliz 2 c 1).&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Law Reform Commission. Report on Section 16 of the Mortgages Act. 1970. p 143 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BPlKAQAAIAAJ]. (1979) Ontario Reports 285 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TEFSAQAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; Queen's printer copies of the Statutes of the Province of Ontario 1968 describe this provision as "new".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/statutesofprovin1968onta Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; This statute replaced the Administration of Justice Expenses Act (RSO 1960 c 5).

==Republic of Ireland==
"Offence against the administration of justice" is defined by [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0027/sec0007.html section 7] of the [[Criminal Procedure Act 2010]].

==United Kingdom==
In England, the administration of justice is a [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|prerogative]] of the [[Crown of the United Kingdom|Crown]]. It may be exercised only through duly-appointed [[Judiciary of England and Wales|judges]] and [[Courts of England and Wales|courts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]]. ''[[A First Book of English Law]]''. Fourth Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1960. Page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following matters and things pertain to the administration of justice: the organisation of the courts; the prerogative of justice, the [[prerogative of mercy]], and any prerogative power to create new courts; [[nolle prosequi]]; the appointment, tenure and immunity of judges; the immunity of other participants in legal proceedings; [[contempt of court]]; the composition and availability of juries, any requirement that their verdict be unanimous, and the allowances they receive; the branches of the legal profession; and the provision of [[legal aid]] and advice.&lt;ref&gt;O. Hood Phillips. ''A First Book of English Law''. Fourth Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1960. Chapter 2. (These matters and things are discussed by the author  in a chapter titled "The Administration of Justice").&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration of justice is an act which is normally associated with the carrying on of the business of government. When a government does that act, it is thereby exercising its sovereignty. It would accordingly be a violation of British sovereignty for a foreign government to do that act in British territory without authorisation.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, Sir Arnold Duncan. Legal Effects of War. Second Edition. Cambridge University Press. 1944. Page 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 2 of the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]] authorises foreign service courts to exercise their jurisdiction in the United Kingdom.

There are [[offences against the administration of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Card, Richard. [[Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law]]. Twelfth Edition. Butterworths. 1992. {{ISBN|0 406 00086 7}}. Chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone's Statutes on Criminal Law: 2004-2005. Fourteenth Edition. Part XIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purpose of section 54 of the [[Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996]], the following are administration of justice offences:
*The offence of [[perverting the course of justice]]
*The offence under section 51(1) of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]
*An offence of aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring, suborning or inciting another person to commit an offence under section 1 of the [[Perjury Act 1911]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/25/section/54 section 54(6)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The offence of perverting the course of justice has been referred to as "interfering with the administration of justice" and as "obstructing the administration of justice".&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. Offences relating to the Administration of Justice. Working Paper No 62. HMSO. 1975. Paragraph 10 at page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 6(c) of the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]] provides that nothing in the foregoing provisions of that Act restricts liability for contempt of court in respect of conduct intended to impede or prejudice the administration of justice.

An [[arrestable offence]], other than one specified in Schedule 5 to the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], was [[serious arrestable offence|serious]] for the purposes of that Act if it led to, or was intended or likely to lead to, amongst other things, serious interference with the administration of justice. An arrestable offence which consisted of making a threat was serious for the purposes of that Act if carrying out the threat would be likely to lead to, amongst other things, serious interference with the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/116/enacted sections 116(1) to (4) and (6)(b)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In any legal proceedings held in public, the court may, where it appears to be necessary for avoiding a substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in those proceedings, or in any other proceedings pending or imminent, order that the publication of any report of the proceedings, or any part of the proceedings, be postponed for such period as the court thinks necessary for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]], section 4(2). Where in proceedings for any offence which is an administration of justice offence for the purposes of section 54 of the [[Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996]] it appears to the court that there is a possibility that (by virtue of that section) proceedings may be taken against a person for an offence of which he has been acquitted, section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 applies as if those proceedings were pending or imminent: The Contempt of Court Act 1981, section 4(2A).&lt;/ref&gt;

Information which is not exempt information by virtue of section 30 of the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] is exempt information if its disclosure under that Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/section/31 section 31(1)(c)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration was adopted by the nations of the [[Americas]] at the Ninth [[International Conference of American States]] in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], in April 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American declaration of the rights and duties of man|url=https://www.cidh.oas.org/Basicos/English/Basic2.American%20Declaration.htm|website=Inter-American Commission on Human Right|access-date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where we can find most of its travaux préparatoires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Paúl|first=Álvaro|date=2017|title=Los trabajos preparatorios de la Declaración Americana de los Derechos y Deberes del Hombre y el origen remoto de la Corte Interamericana|url=https://biblio.juridicas.unam.mx/bjv/detalle-libro/4660-los-trabajos-preparatorios-de-la-declaracion-americana-de-los-derechos-y-deberes-del-hombre-y-el-origen-remoto-de-la-corte-interamericana|location=Mexico|publisher=Instituto de Investigaciones Jurídicas UNAM|page=1|isbn=978-607-02-9613-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same meeting that adopted the [[Charter of the Organization of American States]] and thereby created the [[Organization of American States|OAS]].

Chapter One of the Declaration sets forth a catalogue of [[civil and political rights]] to be enjoyed by the citizens of the signatory nations, together with additional [[economic, social, and cultural rights]] due to them. As a corollary, its second chapter contains a list of corresponding duties. As explained in the preamble:&lt;br&gt;
:"The fulfillment of duty by each individual is a prerequisite to the rights of all. Rights and duties are interrelated in every social and political activity of man. While rights exalt individual liberty, duties express the dignity of that liberty."

Although strictly speaking a declaration is not a [[soft law|legally binding]] treaty, the [[jurisprudence]] of both the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] and the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] holds it to be a source of binding international obligations for the OAS's member states. While largely superseded in the current practice of the inter-American human rights system by the more elaborate provisions of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (in force since 18 July 1978), the terms of the Declaration are still enforced with respect to those states that have not ratified the Convention, such as [[Cuba]], [[United States]], and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/dil/treaties_B-32_American_Convention_on_Human_Rights_sign.htm|title=:: Multilateral Treaties &gt; Department of International Law  &gt; OAS ::|website=www.oas.org|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Insolvency}}

'''Australian insolvency law''' regulates the position of companies which are in financial distress and are unable to pay or provide for all of their debts or other obligations, and matters ancillary to and arising from financial distress. The law in this area is principally governed by the [[Corporations Act 2001]]. Under [[Law of Australia|Australian law]], the term [[insolvency]] is usually used with reference to companies, and [[bankruptcy]] is used in relation to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsymes.com.au/articles/A-Guide-to-Bankruptcy-Laws|title=A Guide to Bankruptcy Laws|publisher=Fox Symes|date=|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insolvency law in Australia tries to seek an equitable balance between the competing interests of [[debtor]]s, [[creditor]]s and the wider community when debtors are unable to meet their financial obligations. The aim of the legislative provisions is to provide:&lt;ref name=Swaab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/australia/x/79816/Insolvency+Bankruptcy/An+Introduction+To+Insolvency+Law+Part+One|title=Australia: An Introduction To Insolvency Law - Part One|publisher=Mondaq|author=Swaab Attorneys|date=18 May 2009|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an orderly and fair procedure to handle the affairs of insolvent companies;
* to ensure a ''[[pari passu]]'' equal distribution of the assets amongst creditors;
* to ensure claims against the insolvent company are resolved with the minimum of delay and expense;
* to rehabilitate financially distressed companies and businesses where viable;
* to engage with key stakeholders in the resolution of insolvency issues; and
* providing for the examination of insolvent companies and their representatives, and the reasons for their failure.

==Insolvency==

A company, partnership, or trust with multiple trustees, is legally insolvent if it is not able to pay its their debts, as and when they become due and payable.&lt;ref name=95A&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|95A}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Solvency and insolvency are defined so as to be mutually exclusive.&lt;ref name=95A /&gt;

The common law has also established various indicators of insolvency. These indicators include amongst others:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSC|123|2003|litigants=ASIC v Plymin, Elliott &amp; Harrison |courtname=[[Supreme Court of Victoria|Supreme Court]] (Vic)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Continuing losses;
* Liquidity ratios below 1;
* Overdue commonwealth and state taxes;
* Poor relationship with bank or other financial institution culminating in an inability to borrow further funds;
* An inability to raise further equity capital; and
* Suppliers placing the company on COD or otherwise demanding ransom payments for continual supply.

===Presumptions of insolvency===

In certain circumstances a debtor may be [[presumption|presumed]] to be insolvent without the need to actually prove financial insolvency. A company will be presumed to be insolvent if, during or after the three months preceding the day on which an application was made for the winding-up of the company, any one of the following six situations occurs.&lt;ref name=459C&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459C}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# the company failed to comply with a [[Australian insolvency law#Statutory demands|statutory demand]];
# execution process issued on a judgment in favour of a creditor was returned wholly or partly unsatisfied;
# in relation to a [[floating charge]]:
## a [[receivership|receiver]] was appointed;
## an order was made for the appointment of a receiver;
## a person assumed control of company property; or
## a person was appointed to enter into possession or assume control of company property.

===Statutory demands===

A popular way for a creditor to prove that a company is insolvent is to serve a statutory demand pursuant to section 459E of the Corporations Act.&lt;ref name=Swaab /&gt; Issuing and serving a statutory demand is a relatively simple and inexpensive process when compared against proving actual financial insolvency. Statutory demands are regulated by Part 5.4, Divisions 2 and 3 of the Corporations Act, and the Courts require that the regime be strictly adhered to. Because a company will irrebuttably be presumed to insolvent where a statutory demand is not complied with, the Court requires creditors to ensure that demands are expressed in clear, accurate and unambiguous terms. Even a small error may result in the statutory demand being set aside by the Court. The statute specifies the form of the demand, and requires that the demand must:&lt;ref name=459E&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459E}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# state the debt claimed, or if the demand relates to two or more debts it must specify the total amount of the debts;
# require the debtor company to pay the debt within 21 days;
# must be in writing in the prescribed form (Form 509H&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iknow.cch.com.au/#!/document/atagUio2142696sl395085116/corporations-regulations-form-509h-creditor-s-statutory-demand-for-payment-of-debt|title=Corporations Regulations Form 509H Creditor’s statutory demand for payment of debt|publisher=CCH iKnow|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;); and
# must be signed by or on behalf of the creditor.

====Requirements====

In relation to the debt to which the demand relates:
* the debt must be due and payable - it cannot be contingent, prospective or unliquidated;
* a creditor may not serve a demand at the same time as taking proceedings against the debtors company's directors in relation to the same alleged debt as this would constitute an abuse of process;
The demand must be served on the company by leaving it at its registered office, sending it by post to that office, or delivering a copy of the demand personally to the director of the company.

Upon being served with a valid demand, the debtor may either pay the debt, or secure or compound the debt to the creditor's reasonable satisfaction. Failure to do so within 21 days (unless an extension is granted) will mean that insolvency of the debtor is presumed and the creditor may use that presumption in order to make a winding-up application to the Court.

====Setting aside a statutory demand====

A debtor company can also apply to set aside a statutory demand on various grounds. These include:
* where there is a genuine dispute about the existence of the debt;&lt;ref name=459H1a&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459H}}(1)(a).&lt;/ref&gt;
* where the company has an [[set-off (law)|offsetting claim]];&lt;ref name=459H1b&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459H}}(1)(b).&lt;/ref&gt;
* where there is a defect in the demand and substantial injustice will be caused;&lt;ref name=459J1a&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459J}}(1)(a). &lt;/ref&gt; and/or
* where there is some other reason why the demand should be set aside.&lt;ref name=459J1b&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459J}}(1)(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Genuine Dispute =====
Various cases in Australia have decided what a genuine dispute is, and is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://debtrecoveryqld.com.au/setting-aside-statutory-demand/|title=Setting Aside a Statutory Demand in Australia|last=|first=|date=2018-04-15|work=Debt Recovery Qld|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A genuine dispute should:

# Show a plausible contention requiring investigation;&lt;ref name="Eyota"&gt;''Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd'' (1994) 12 [[Australian Company and Security Reports|ACSR]] 785 {{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=12%20ACLC%20669 |title=LawCite}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Be bona fide, genuine and real;&lt;ref name="Eyota"/&gt;
# Be in good faith and show a prima facie plausibility;&lt;ref name="TR Admin"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|VSCA|70|2008|litigants=TR Administration Pty Ltd v Frank Marchetti &amp; Sons Pty Ltd |date=5 May 2008 |courtname=[[Victorian Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (Vic)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Truly exist in fact, and contain a serious question to be tried;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCA|618|1993|litigants=Scanhill Pty Ltd v Century 21 Australasia Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1993) 47 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 451 |date=15 December 1993 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Be something more than mere bluster or mere assertion;&lt;ref&gt;''Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Ltd'' (1993) 11 [[Australian Company and Security Reports|ACSR]] 601 {{Cite web|url=https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=11+ACSR+601|title=LawCite}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Be a claim that may have some substance;&lt;ref name="Chadwick Ind"&gt;''Chadwick Industries (South Coast) Pty Ltd v Condensing Vaporisers Pty Ltd'' (1994) 13 [[Australian Company and Security Reports|ACSR]] 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Have a sufficient degree of cogency to be arguable;&lt;ref name="Cgi Info"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|NSWSC|728|2003|litigants=Cgi Information Systems v Apra Consulting Pty Ltd |date=8 August 2003 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of NSW|Supreme Court]] (NSW)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Have objective existence;&lt;ref name="TR Admin"/&gt; and
# Have sufficient factual particularity.&lt;ref name="TR Admin"/&gt;

A genuine dispute should not:

# Be spurious, hypothetical, illusory or misconceived;&lt;ref name="Eyota"/&gt;
# Be plainly vexatious or frivolous;&lt;ref name="Chadwick Ind" /&gt;
# Be so devoid of substance that no further investigation is warranted;&lt;ref name="Cgi Info" /&gt;
# Be merely spurious claim, bluster or assertion;&lt;ref name="TR Admin" /&gt; and
# Be merely fanciful or futile.&lt;ref name="TR Admin" /&gt;

===== Offsetting Claim =====
You may also set aside a statutory demand if you have an offsetting claim.&lt;ref name="459H1b" /&gt;

Section 459H(1)(b) of the ''Corporations Act 2001'' (Cth)&lt;ref name="s459H"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459H}} Determination of application where there is a dispute or offsetting claim.&lt;/ref&gt; says:

''(1) This section applies where, on an application under section 459G, the Court is satisfied…''

''(b) that the company has an offsetting claim.''

Then goes on to define an offsetting claim to mean:

''“offsetting claim” means a genuine claim that the company has against the respondent by way of counterclaim, set-off or cross-demand (even if it does not arise out of the same transaction or circumstances as a debt to which the demand relates).''

This means that any claim that you have against the person/company issuing the demand, can be used to set aside the demand.  Especially if the offsetting claim means that the offset total of the demand drops below the statutory minimum.

===== Defect in the Demand Causing Substantial Injustice =====
A statutory demand can also be set aside pursuant to section 459J(1)(a)&lt;ref name="s459J"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459J}}Setting aside demand on other grounds.&lt;/ref&gt; if ''because of a defect in the demand, substantial injustice will be caused unless the demand is set aside.''

Section 9 of the ''Corporations Act''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|9}} Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; defines the word “'''''defect'''''” to mean:

''“defect“, in relation to a statutory demand, includes:''

''(a)  an irregularity; and''

''(b)  a misstatement of an amount or total; and''

''(c)  a misdescription of a debt or other matter; and''

''(d)  a misdescription of a person or entity.''

However, a simple defect is not enough to allow the demand to be set aside, it must cause substantial injustice.

There are a number of cases in Australia which have decided what a defect in a demand which will cause substantial injustice is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://debtrecoveryqld.com.au/setting-aside-statutory-demand-complete-guide/|title=Setting Aside Statutory Demand|last=|first=|date=2018-05-20|work=Debt Recovery Qld|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some examples of this are:

* Misstatement of a Debt, Amount, or Total;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|NSWSC|1406|2007|litigants=LSI Australia v LSI Holdings |date=6 December 2007 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of NSW|Supreme Court]] (NSW)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|NSWSC|1139|2005|litigants=Condor Asset Management Ltd v Excelsior Eastern Ltd |date=10 November 2005 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of NSW|Supreme Court]] (NSW)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Incorrect Interest Calculation;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCA|589|1993|litigants=Topfelt Pty Limited v State Bank of New South Wales Limited |parallelcite=(1993) 47 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 226 |date=7 December 1993 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Defect in the Names of the Parties;&lt;ref&gt;''Re Macro Constructions Pty Ltd'' [1994] 2 Qd R 31&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''Scandon Pty Ltd v Dome Supplies Pty Ltd'' (1995) 17 [[Australian Company and Security Reports|ACSR]] 662&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also cases in Australia which have decided that certain defects in the demand do not cause substantial injustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://debtrecoveryqld.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Setting-Aside-Statutory-Demand-Free-eBook.pdf|title=Setting Aside a Statutory Demand|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some examples are:

==== Effect ====
If a company fails to satisfy a statutory demand, or have it set aside, then it is presumed to be insolvent.&lt;ref name="459C" /&gt; The company requires leave of the court to before it can challenge the debt in opposing an application to wind up the company.&lt;ref name="459s"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459S}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the presumption is that the company has to prove that it is solvent.&lt;ref name="459C" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|728|1999|litigants=Ace Contractors &amp; Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Pty Ltd |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bankruptcy Term===

On the 19th October 2017 The Australian Federal Parliament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017B00235/Explanatory%20Memorandum/Text|title= Bankruptcy Amendment (Enterprise Incentives) Bill 2017|date= October 19, 2017|website= [[Parliament of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a bill is to reduce the period of bankruptcy from three years to one year.

==Liquidation==

{{Main|Liquidation}}

[[Liquidation]] is the process whereby the assets of a company are collected and realised by a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]], and the proceeds are subsequently applied to discharge all relevant debts and liabilities in accordance with the priorities set by law. Any balance which may remain after paying the costs and expenses of winding-up is then distributed among the members according to their respective rights and interests.

A company may be wound up on either a voluntary basis or on a compulsory basis.

===Types of liquidation===

There are three different types of winding-up:
* members' voluntary winding-up
* creditors' voluntary winding-up
* compulsory winding-up

====Members' voluntary winding-up====

A members' voluntary winding-up is not technically an insolvency process. It is a voluntary liquidation entered into by the members where the company is not insolvent. The process is initiated by a [[special resolution]] of the company,&lt;ref name=s491&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|491}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the creditors have no direct involvement and are repaid in full. The directors are required to give a declaration as to the solvency of the company which must be filed with the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] (ASIC).

Where a liquidator who is appointed pursuant to a members' voluntary winding-up subsequently determines that the company is in fact insolvent in his opinion (contrary to the solvency declaration made by the [[board of directors]]), then the liquidator must either (a) apply to the Court for the company to be wound-up on an insolvent basis, (b) appoint an [[administration (law)|administrator]] to the company, or (c) convene a meeting of creditors. If a meeting of the creditors is convened, then from the time of the meeting the winding-up will be treated as a [[Australian insolvency law#Creditors' voluntary winding-up|creditors' voluntary winding-up]].

====Creditors' voluntary winding-up====

A creditors' voluntary winding-up is also initiated by the members but (in contrast to a members' voluntary winding-up) where it has been determined that the company is insolvent. The process normally occurs where the [[board of directors]] has determined that the company is insolvent and then recommended to the members that it be wound up. However, [[Australian insolvency law#Members' voluntary winding-up|as noted above]], it may also be initiated by a liquidator was originally appointed pursuant to members voluntary winding-up where the liquidator has subsequently formed the opinion that the company is actually insolvent.

====Compulsory winding-up====

A compulsory liquidation is usually the result of an action taken by one or more creditors of an insolvent company. Compulsory liquidation is a statutory procedure which enables a person to apply to the Court for an order that the affairs of a company be wound-up. A number of different people have ''[[locus standi]]'' to initiate compulsory liquidation proceedings, including not only the company's creditors (who are the most common applicants), but also the company itself, the company's members, the liquidator, ASIC and (in respect of a general insurance company) the [[Australian Prudential Regulation Authority]] (APRA). But in most cases compulsory liquidation will normally be commenced by one or more creditors.

===Commencement of winding-up proceedings===

In a compulsory winding up, the day on which the relevant Court order is made will constitute the date of the commencement of the winding up. The date on which the application to wind up the company was filed is called the ''relation-back day''.
Whether the liquidation process is initiated by an order of the Court or through a creditors' voluntary winding up, a liquidator will be appointed to administer the winding up of the affairs of the company.

===The liquidator===

{{Main|Liquidator (law)}}

The liquidator is the principal officer of the company who is appointed to conduct the winding-up process. Where the company is insolvent, the liquidation will invariable be an accountant who is an insolvency professional.

====Appointment====

In a compulsory winding up the Court will appoint the liquidator to the company. Generally it will act upon the nomination of the party making the application. In a voluntary winding up, the liquidator will be appointed by the members or creditors of a company. Liquidators are required to be members of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia]] or [[CPA Australia]]. They must be an independent person and be seen to be fully independent.

====Role of the liquidator====

The liquidator's role has been described as a hybrid role with elements of fiduciary trustee, agent, officer of the corporation and in some instances officer of the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|1384|1996|litigants=Sydloq Pty Ltd v TG Kotselas Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1996) 65 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 234 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The liquidator owes [[fiduciary]] duties to the company, its creditors and members. The liquidator is required to act honestly, fairly and impartially at all times, and must avoid any [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]].

Liquidators should exercise their powers and discharge their duties with the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise if they were a director or officer of a corporation if the corporation's circumstances and occupied the office held by, and had the same responsibilities within the corporation as, the director or officer.

Upon the appointment of the liquidator, all of the powers of the directors are suspended and the company itself will cease to carry on business except to the extent that the liquidator believes it will assist the beneficial disposal of the business. The liquidator will take over operation of the company and can deal with the property of the company.   
The functions of the liquidator are to:
* wind-up the affairs of the company;
* ascertain and recover the property of the company;
* to distribute the company's assets equitably among its creditors; and
* to examine the circumstances which precipitated the liquidation and which may reveal improper dispositions of property and criminal offences.

====Duties of the liquidator====

Liquidators are subject to a number of duties, including [[fiduciary duty|fiduciary duties]] to the company itself. In relation to the administration of the liquidation the statutory duties of the liquidator include:
* To ascertain and take possession of all the assets of the company. The liquidator is empowered to take into custody all property which the company is or appears to be entitled to.
* To preserve the assets of the company by taking an inventory, insuring the assets, investing funds wisely and defending any claims initiated against the company to recover assets or claim for damages;
* A duty to liquidate and realise the value of the assets for the benefit of the company;
* A duty to report and investigate on the affairs of the company, including settling a list of contributories and ascertaining the liabilities of the company;
* Administrative duties which require certain documents to be lodged with governmental bodies, and the keeping of accurate accounts and records of all matters relating to the liquidation.

===Company property===

The liquidator is entitled to all the assets belonging to the company at the commencement of the winding up. But:
* the liquidator is not entitled to property which is subject to a valid [[security interest]], or which is held on [[trust law|trust]] for another person;
* the liquidator is not entitled to goods in the company's possession that the company holds as [[bailment|bailee]]&lt;ref&gt;Subject to any claim the company may have to a [[lien]] over the goods.&lt;/ref&gt; or which are subject to a valid [[retention of title clause]]; and
* aside from current assets, the liquidator can also recover property or money from other persons, or seek to enhance the pool of estates by pursuing claims on behalf of the company.

Any property of the company which is disposed of after the deemed commencement of winding-up (other than by the liquidator in the exercise of his or her powers) is [[void (law)|void]] unless validated by the Court.&lt;ref name=s468&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|468}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collateral for security====

Any property of the company which is subject to a valid security interest is not considered part of the insolvent estate, and the insolvency process does not prevent a secured creditor from enforcing their rights over the relevant collateral.&lt;ref name=s471C&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|471C}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Onerous property====

The liquidator also has power to disclaim any onerous property or contracts of the company in liquidation with the leave of the Court.&lt;ref name=s568&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|568}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Any damages due to a counterparty to a contract which has been disclaimed may be proved as a debt in the winding-up.

===Claims===

Any creditor wishing to make a claim with respect to a debt due from the company must formally make and prove the claim in accordance with the regulations.&lt;ref name=s553D&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|553D}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[secured creditor]] will not normally make a claim in the liquidation unless there is a shortfall in the collateral provided by the insolvent company.&lt;ref name=s554E&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|554E}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if a secured creditor wishes to do so, it may release its [[security interest|security]], and claim in the winding-up for the full amount.&lt;ref name=s554E /&gt;

====Insolvency set-off====

Where there are mutual debts between the company and any of its creditors when the company goes into winding-up then those debts will [[set-off (law)|set-off]].&lt;ref name=s553C&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|553C}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However a creditor is not entitled to claim the benefit of insolvency set-off if, at the time of giving or receiving credit to or from the company, the creditor had notice of the fact that the company was insolvent. Mutual debts are only capable of being set-off if each party is the beneficial owner of each debt (set-off is not available where the debt is owed to one person as agent for another, or where the debt has been assigned or secured in favour of a third party).

====Priority of claims====

Where any of the assets of the company are subject to a valid [[security interest]] (not being a floating charge), those claims will normally be enforced against the assets outside of (and in priority to) the liquidation process. The priority of unsecured claims to the assets of the company in a liquidation is regulated by section 556 of the Corporations Act.&lt;ref name=s556&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|556}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The rules are very detailed, but broadly they provide that:
# Properly incurred liquidation expenses are paid out first; followed by
# If the Court so order, the costs of the winding-up application;
# Any claims of an administrator to be indemnified;
# Expenses properly incurred by any "relevant authority" (as defined);
# Deferred expenses;
# Wages, superannuation contributions and superannuation guarantee charges;
# Claims for injury compensation;
# Amounts due because of an industrial instrument;
# Retrenchment payments payable to employees; and then
# Ordinary unsecured creditors.

All ordinary unsecured creditors ranks equally between themselves,&lt;ref name=s555&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|555}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and within each rank of [[Preferential creditor|preferred creditors]], the preferred creditors rank equally.&lt;ref name=s559&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|559}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the relevant provisions: &lt;br /&gt;
"''Deferred expenses''" means, broadly, the fees and expenses properly incurred by a relevant authority.&lt;br /&gt;
"''Relevant authority''" means a liquidator or provisional liquidator, administrator or administrator of a deed of company arrangement.&lt;br /&gt;
"''Retrenchment payment''" means an amount payable to the employee by virtue of an industrial instrument in respect of the termination of the employee's employment by the company. &lt;br /&gt;
"''Industrial instrument''" is defined in section 9&lt;ref&gt;{{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the statute as (a) a contract of employment; or (b) a law, award, determination or agreement relating to terms or conditions of employment.

==Restructuring options==

If the company is potentially salvageable with a realistic prospect of surviving its [[financial distress|financial difficulties]], a company may seek to enter into a non-liquidation arrangement. The two principal types are voluntary administration and deeds of company arrangement. These forms of administration are considered when the debtor company is insolvent or likely to become insolvent. Unlike receivership (which is usually initiated by a [[secured creditor]]) these two forms of administration are normally initiated by the company itself.

Voluntary administrations and deeds of company arrangement are regulated under Part 5.3A of the Corporations Act. The purpose is to provide for the business, property and affairs of an insolvent company to be administered in a way that:
# maximises the chances of the company, or as much as possible of its business, continuing in existence; or
# if it is not possible for the company or business to survive as a going concern, would result in a better return for the company's creditors and members than would result from an immediate winding up of the company.

===Voluntary administration===

{{Main|Administration (law)}}

Voluntary administration commences from the time when an administrator is appointed,&lt;ref name=s437A&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|437A}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and usually ends either upon the execution by the company of a deed of company arrangement or a resolution by the creditors that the company should be wound up.

An administrator may be appointed by:
* the company;&lt;ref name=s436A&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|436A}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* a liquidator or provisional liquidator;&lt;ref name=s436B&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|436B}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or
* a chargee of the whole, or substantially the whole, of the company's property where the company is not already being wound up.&lt;ref name=s436A/&gt;
Upon their appointment an administrator is obliged to lodge a notice of appointment with ASIC in order to provide notification that the company is under external administration. The administrator must also publish a notice of appointment in a newspaper. Once an administrator is appointed, any use of the company's name must be followed by the words "(Administrator Appointed)".

Where the company is to survive as a going concern the aim of the voluntary administration process is the entering into of a deed of company arrangement. If a deed of company arrangement is executed it will lead to another administration, governed by the terms of the deed of company arrangement . Although both administrations are dealt with under the same part of the statute, the two are actually separate processes.

====The administrator====

An administrator must be a registered liquidator who gives consent in writing to accept their appointment. Various persons are disqualified from acting as a company's administrator, including creditors with an interest in the company over $5000, a director, secretary or employee of the company, a director, secretary or employee of a company that is a mortgagee to the company's property, or an auditor of the company.

The core role of the administrator is outlined in the legislation.&lt;ref name=s437A /&gt; Whilst a company is under administration, the administrator:
# has control of the company's business, property and affairs; and
# may carry on that business and manage that property and those affairs; and
# may terminate or dispose of all or part of that business, and may dispose of any of that property; and
# may perform any function, and exercise any powers, that the company or any of its officers could perform or exercise if the company were not under administration.

The administrator is also required to investigate the affairs of the company and consider any possible causes of action and report to creditors. As soon as practicable after the administration of a company begins, the administrator must:&lt;ref name=s438A&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|438A}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# investigate the company's business, property, affairs and financial circumstances; and
# form an opinion about each of the following matters:
## whether it would be in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to execute a deed of company arrangement;
## whether it would be in the creditors' interests for the administration to end;
## whether it would be in the creditors' interests for the company to be wound up.

In carrying out these tasks the administrator acts as agent of the company.&lt;ref name=s437B&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|437B}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the administrator has broad powers to deal with the company's property and carry on the company's business. The administrator is also entitled to the company's books and the officers of the company have an obligation to hand over any books in their possession. The directors are also required to provide the administrator with a statement about the company's business, property, affairs and financial circumstances within one week of the administrator being appointed, and must assist the administrator whenever reasonably required.

====Effect of voluntary administration====

The principal effects of voluntary administration are:
* the company's business, property and affairs come under the control of the administrator:&lt;ref name=s437A /&gt;
* the company's officers lose the right to use their authority and can only exercise that authority with the written approval of the administrator;
* the appointment of an administrator leads to a [[Moratorium (law)|statutory moratorium]] meaning that legal proceedings, winding-up proceedings and execution against company property cannot be commenced or continued by creditors without written consent of the administrator or leave of the Court;
* the retention of the company's employees is ultimately within the administrator's discretion, and the administrator may terminate employees without incurring any personal liability;
* contracts with a company under administration are not automatically terminated - the appointment of an administrator does not reflect an intention on the part of the company to repudiate contracts already entered into, nor does it necessarily constitute a breach or repudiation of a continuing contract. This will however, depend upon the terms of the particular contract. Unlike a liquidator, an administrator does not have any statutory power to disclaim onerous contracts;
* while the company is in administration, the owner or lessor of property that is used or occupied by, or is in the possession of, the company cannot take possession of that property or otherwise recover it - except where a supplier of perishable property is entitled to recover those goods under section 441G or where the owner/lessor can obtain the administrator's written consent or the leave of the Court under;&lt;ref name=s440C&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|440C}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* creditors who have supplied goods to a company pursuant to a contract which includes a retention of title clause, and the company then goes into administration, are often unable to recover the goods because of the restriction of section 440C provided the company is using the goods;
* where property is being used or occupied by the company in administration, but belongs to someone else, the administrator is only able to dispose of it in the ordinary course of business with the consent of the owner or with leave of the Court:&lt;ref name=s440C /&gt;
** creditors are required to obtain leave of the Court to enforce guarantees against directors, their spouses, de facto spouses or their relatives;&lt;ref name=s440J&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|440J}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and
** during the period of administration, the administrator controls all financial and other dealings of the company.

If the administrator, in good faith, makes a payment or enters into a transaction, that act is valid and effectual for the purposes of the Corporations Act and cannot be set aside in a subsequent winding up of the company.&lt;ref name=s451C&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|451C}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deeds of company arrangement===

A deed of company arrangement is also a type of administration. But unlike a [[scheme of arrangement]] it is not a standalone process. A deed of company arrangement is broadly a compromise agreement entered into between the company and its creditors that follows on from a voluntary administration, much like a [[company voluntary arrangement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/insolvency/insolvency-for-employees/employees-deed-of-company-arrangement/|title=What is a deed of company arrangement?|publisher=ASIC|date=|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a deed of company arrangement is agreed to by creditors, it will normally result in a successful financial restructuring of the company. Alternatively, less commonly, the deed of company arrangement sometimes simply operates as a way to maximise the benefits of the creditors over the short term. During the operation of the deed of company arrangement a company normally continues to trade, however any debts incurred after the execution of the deed of company arrangement are not covered by the deed, and are treated as expenses of the administration process.

An administrator of the deed of company arrangement must be appointed, and this will usually be the former administrator from the voluntary administration continuing in office. The Corporations Act permits a great deal flexibility in relation to the deed of company arrangement. The deed of company arrangement may involve a simple moratorium for a fixed period, or a composition of creditors' claims whereby creditors agree to accept a [[cram down]], or a plan to pay creditors in deferred instalments, or some combination of these things.

====Advantages====

The main aim of a deed of company arrangement is to try and produce a better outcome for all parties than would result upon a liquidation. There are a number of advantages which can potentially arise from a consensual deed of company arrangement.&lt;ref name=Swaab /&gt; The principal advantage for the company is normally that it can continue to trade during the deed of company arrangement period and may be able to survive its financial difficulties. In addition, for the company and its directors:
* the officers will not be seen as officers of a company that is in liquidation;
* creditors of the company will no longer place pressure for payment on the company;
* because the company is not in liquidation, [[insolvent trading]] claims against the directors cannot be commenced;
* the company may be able to carry forward tax benefits as deductions against any future earnings; and
* the company may redevelop its business during the deed of company arrangement period.
The primary benefit for the company's creditors is that there is a potential for a better dividend than what the creditors would otherwise receive if the company were to be broken up and wound-up by a liquidator. Other potential advantages of a deed of company arrangement for the company's creditors are:
* a dividend under a deed of company arrangement may be received more quickly than if the company was being wound up, and third parties may be willing to contribute funds to the company which would not otherwise be available;
* the directors, related companies and some creditors may be willing to defer or waive their claims under a deed of company arrangement, increasing the funds available to the deed of company arrangement creditors;
* the creditors of a company may elect to retain the company as a customer;
* deed of company arrangement administrators can be selected based on relevant industry experience; and
* the administrator of a deed of company arrangement will not have the power to seek recovery with respect to [[Australian insolvency law#Avoidance of transactions|voidable transactions]].

====Effect of a deed of company arrangement====

Once a deed of company arrangement is executed, the administration of the company ends and the moratorium restrictions that apply to creditors come to an end and are replaced by the deed of company arrangement's moratorium provisions.

The deed of company arrangement binds the deed administrator, the company and its officers and the members of the company and releases the company from its debts to the extent provided by the deed of company arrangement. If a creditor fails to lodge a proof of debt in the administration of a deed of company arrangement, that creditor may be prevented from participating in any distribution of the fund created by deed of company arrangement.

The company is bound by the terms of the deed of company arrangement throughout the term of its operation.&lt;ref name=s444D&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|444D}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The company will also be required to change all public documents by inserting the words "(Subject To A Deed Of Company Arrangement)" after its name. In exceptional circumstances the Court may order that this requirement may be dispensed with.&lt;ref name=s447A&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|447A}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the voluntary administration of the company ends and the deed of company arrangement comes into effect, and the powers of the directors are resurrected. However, the deed of company arrangement binds the directors of the company. The deed of company arrangement also binds all creditors in so far as they possess any claims arising before the effective date referred to in the deed of company arrangement. Creditor's claims are normally compromised to some degree under the terms of a deed of company arrangement in order to preserve the company as a [[going concern]]. Accordingly, a creditor who is bound by a deed of company arrangement will be unable to subsequently apply for a winding-up order against the company in respect of those claims.

[[Secured creditor]]s can continue to deal with their own security and are generally not bound by the terms of a deed of company arrangement unless they have expressly consented to it.

==Avoidance of transactions==

The liquidator of a company may in some cases seek to claw back the benefit of transactions which the company undertook during the "twilight period" prior to the commencement of the winding-up. These are generally referred to as "voidable transactions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/DeakinLawRw/1995/3.pdf|title=Challenging fraudulent transactions and unfair loans as voidable pre-liquidation transactions|author=Andrew Keay}} (1995) 2(1) Deakin Law Review 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the division is to protect "the interests of unsecured creditors which might otherwise be prejudiced by a company disposing of assets or incurring liabilities or entering into unrealistic loans shortly before winding up".

There are several different types of voidable transactions:&lt;ref name=s588FE&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588FE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Unfair preference]]s&lt;ref name=s588FA&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588FA}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[undervalue transaction|Uncommercial transactions]];&lt;ref name=s588FB&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588FB}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fraudulent transactions;&lt;ref name=s588FE5&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588FE(5).|publisher=AUSTLII|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unfair loans;&lt;ref name=s588FD&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588FD}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Unreasonable director-related transactions.&lt;ref name=s588FDA&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588FDA}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfair preferences and uncommercial transactions are collectively referred to as "insolvent transactions" because of the requirement that the company must have been insolvent and the time they were entered into, or caused the company to become insolvent.

===Insolvent transactions===

Insolvent transactions are transactions entered into by a company whilst insolvent, or transactions entered into by the company the result of which caused the company to become insolvent. An insolvent transaction may be voidable when one of the following conditions apply:
# It was entered into during the 6-month period immediately before the relation back day or during the period between the relation back day and the winding up;
# it was an uncommercial transaction entered into during 2 years prior to relation back day;
# it was a related entity transaction during the 4-year period prior to the relation back day;
# it involved a situation where the company was a party to an unfair preference or uncommercial transaction in order to defeat, delay or interfere with the rights of any or all of its creditors and the transaction was entered into during the ten years immediately prior to the relation back day.

There are two categories of insolvent transactions: unfair preferences,&lt;ref name=s588FA /&gt; and uncommercial transactions.&lt;ref name=s588FB /&gt;

====Unfair preference====
A transaction is an unfair preference if the company and the creditor are parties to the transaction and the transaction results in the creditor receiving from the company, in relation to an unsecured debt owed to the creditor, a greater amount than it would have received in relation to the debt in a winding up of the company. 
The liquidator will be required to prove the various elements in order to retrieve the monies paid out by the company. These include that:&lt;ref name=s588FA /&gt;
# there was a transaction between the company and a creditor;
# the transaction was an insolvent transaction (that is the company was insolvent at the time of the transaction or the transaction caused the company to become insolvent);
# the transaction occurred within six months of the relation back date or within four years of the relation back date if the transaction is with a related entity; and
# the creditor received more than it would have in a winding-up of the company.

If a transaction is held to constitute an unfair preference, the recipient will be required to repay the benefit received from the company to the liquidator for general distribution to all creditors.

====Uncommercial transactions====

An uncommercial transaction is an insolvent transaction (that is the company was insolvent at the time of the transaction or the transaction caused the company to become insolvent) that a reasonable person in the place of the company would not have entered into, taking into account:&lt;ref name=s588FB /&gt;
* the relevant benefits and the detriments to the company; and
* the respective benefits to the other parties involved and any other relevant matter.

It is not necessary for the liquidator to demonstrate that the transaction was between the company and a creditor. The transaction can be between the company and any party. An uncommercial transaction can be voided if it was entered into during the 2 years prior to the relation-back day, or 4 years prior to the relation-back day if a related entity is a party to the transaction.

====Fraudulent transactions====

Where it is not possible to categorise transactions as unfair preferences or uncommercial transactions, they may still be voidable even if entered into outside of the time periods usually applied to such transactions. This will be the case where transactions were entered into by the company for the purpose of defeating, delaying or interfering with the rights of creditors during the 10 years prior to the relation back day.&lt;ref name=s588FE5 /&gt;

===Unfair loans===

A liquidator may seek to avoid an unfair loan where the loan or loans were subject to interest or charges that are extortionate.&lt;ref name=s588FD /&gt; In determining whether a loan is unfair, the Court will look at such things as the risk assumed by the company in lending, the value of any security in respect of the loan and the term of the loan. The unfair loan provisions do not require that the transaction be an insolvent transaction.

===Unreasonable director-related transactions===

A liquidator may seek to reclaim unreasonable payments made by companies to directors prior to liquidation, for example, by way of an excessive bonus. This provision extends to payments made to "close associates" of any director, conveyances, transfers, other dispositions of property, the issue of securities, and the incurring of an obligation to enter into these obligations.&lt;ref name=s588FDA /&gt;

A transaction will be deemed an unreasonable director-related transaction if a reasonable person in the company's circumstances would not have entered into the transaction.

===Defences===

The Court may not make an order against a party where it would materially prejudice a right or interest of a person who is able to bring themselves within the protective provision. Where the person defending the liquidator's claim was not a party to the voidable transaction, the protective provision requires that they must prove that they did not receive a benefit as a result of the transaction, or if a benefit was received, that it was received in [[good faith]] and at the time there was no reasonable grounds for suspecting company insolvent. But if the person defending the liquidator's claim was a party to the voidable transaction then they must prove:&lt;ref name=s588FGB&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588FGB}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# that they became a party to the transaction in good faith;
# that at the time they became a party to the transaction, they had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the company was insolvent at that time or would become insolvent;
# that a reasonable person in the recipient's circumstances would have had no such grounds for so suspecting; and
# that valuable consideration was provided or that they changed their position in reliance on the transaction.

==Director liability==

The liquidator also has a duty to investigate the company's officers and to determine whether there may be any liability for anything done by them prior to the company going into liquidation. Where the directors or officers have been guilty of either insolvent trading or misfeasance, this may provide the basis for financial claims against them, which the liquidator can use to swell the assets available for distribution to the creditors.

The Corporations Act codifies several duties into sections 180 to 183 of the statute.

|}

===Insolvent trading===
{{Main|Trading whilst insolvent}}

A director of an insolvent company may be personally liable for insolvent trading if: &lt;ref name=s588G&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588G}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# he or she was director of the company at the time when the company incurred a debt;
# the company was insolvent at the time when the debt was incurred, or became insolvent as a result of the incurring of the debt;
# there were reasonable grounds for believing that the company was insolvent or would become insolvent; and
# a reasonable person in the position of a director in the company's circumstances would have been aware of the company's insolvency.

If a director is found to be in breach, then they may also be subject to a civil penalty application by ASIC. ASIC may also seek compensation orders on behalf of the creditors in addition to the liquidator.

===Common law duties===

The breach of [[common law]] [[Board of directors#Duties|directors' duties]] may enable a liquidator to recover property from a director, or may give the liquidator a right to an account of profits. If a director removes or misuses company property, this would ordinarily be a breach of their duty of good faith, and may render the transaction [[voidable]]. Accordingly, the liquidator may attempt to recover the property from the director, who is deemed to hold it on [[constructive trust]] for the company. A director who breaches the duty to use reasonable care and diligence may also be liable for damages if the company suffered loss as a result of the breach.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd]]'' [1983] Ch 258&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil penalties===

A person who contravenes duties set out in sections 180-183 of the Corporations Act may also be made subject to a civil penalty order of up to AU$200,000 upon the application of ASIC. The success rate of ASIC when seeking civil penalties is extremely high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=789116067090117098117107108092011010100085029034061049102013104014084117066126082110057122057000109057009023082124083076089124033036011060059098097126068079067110091051040022022015117082126005124013111074007108096026094082090066083104082111120098&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;TYPE=2|title=The Use of Civil Sanctions for Breaches of Corporate Law|publisher=[[Monash University]]|author=Michelle Welsh|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director may be ordered to pay compensation to the company in addition if the Court is satisfied that the corporation has suffered some loss as a result of the director's breach.

===Criminal liability===

Officers of a company who breach sections 180-183 of the Corporations Act may also be [[criminal law|criminally liable]] if: &lt;ref name=s184&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|184}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

# directors use the information that they receive dishonestly with either the intention of gaining an advantage or causing the company to suffer a detriment, or acting recklessly as to whether they might gain an advantage or cause the company a detriment.

'''The Bridgewater Four''' is the collective name given to the four men who were tried and found guilty of killing 13-year-old [[Newspaper delivery|paperboy]] Carl Bridgewater, who was shot in the head at close range near [[Stourbridge]], England, in 1978.  

In February 1997, after almost two decades of imprisonment, their convictions were overturned on technical grounds and the three surviving defendants were released; the fourth defendant had died in prison two years into his sentence. Bridgewater's murder remains officially unsolved.

The investigations were carried out by the [[West Midlands Serious Crime Squad]].&lt;ref name="bridgewaterfour"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lockley |first1=Mike |title=Vincent Hickey had called for murder case to be reopened |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/bridgewater-four-vincent-hickey-called-11465902 |website=Birmingham Live |accessdate=14 July 2018 |date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
Carl Bridgewater (2 January 1965 – 19 September 1978) was shot dead on 19 September 1978 at Yew Tree Farm near [[Stourbridge]], [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], while delivering a newspaper to the house. The occupants of the house – elderly cousins Mary Poole and Fred Jones – were not home at the time.&lt;ref name="onthisday"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/20/newsid_2524000/2524697.stm|title=

==Conviction and sentencing==
The Bridgewater Four were Patrick Molloy, James Robinson and cousins Michael Hickey and Vincent Hickey.

They came to the attention of police working on the murder investigation following further serious crimes later in 1978. On 24 November, Robinson, Hickey and an unidentified third man carried out an armed robbery at a [[Tesco]] supermarket on the [[Castle Vale]] estate in [[Birmingham]]. Hickey and Robinson raided the safe while the third man held several terrified shoppers at bay with a gun. When the manager tried to intervene a shot was fired over his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Murder at the Farm |author=Paul Foot |page=46 |isbn=0-7472-5870-8 |publisher=Headline Review |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six days later, Robinson and the Hickey brothers robbed an elderly couple at Chapel Farm, [[Romsley, Worcestershire|Romsley]], near [[Halesowen]]. Vincent Hickey stayed in the car while Robinson and Michael Hickey charged into the house wearing balaclavas, brandishing a shotgun and shouting for money. The victims of this robbery displayed great courage but the robbers got away with £200. Robinson took the lead, hitting one of the victims with the gun but not firing it.&lt;ref&gt;Foot p38, p46&lt;/ref&gt;

Molloy was the first to be arrested. During questioning which also covered Carl's murder, Molloy told police that he had been in an upstairs bedroom at Yew Tree Farm while robbing the house when he heard a gunshot downstairs. Shortly afterwards, the other three men were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2952463.stm |work=BBC News |title=Miscarriage of justice |date=16 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All denied committing [[murder in English law|murder]], but three of them were convicted of murder at [[Stafford]] [[Crown Court]] on 9 November 1979. The fourth, Molloy, was found guilty of [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]]. They were sentenced on 12 November.

James Robinson (aged 45) and Vincent Hickey (aged 25) were both sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] with a recommended minimum term of 25 years, which would have kept them behind bars until at least 2004 and the ages of 70 and 50 respectively. Michael Hickey (aged 18) was sentenced to be detained indefinitely [[at Her Majesty's pleasure]], though it was anticipated he would serve a shorter sentence than the two others convicted of murder due to his age. Patrick Molloy (aged 51) received a 12-year prison sentence on the manslaughter charge, but he died of a [[heart attack]] in prison two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/vincent-hickey-i-want-justice-for-carl-234477 |journal=Birmingham Mail |title=Vincent Hickey: I want justice for Carl Bridgewater's family 
|date=14 September 2008 |first=Anuji |last=Varma |accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case quashed==
An appeal in March 1989 was rejected,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3636902/Who-REALLY-killed-Carl-Bridgewater-Murder-young-paperboy-40-years-ago-remains-one-country-s-terrible-unsolved-murders-mystery-finally-SOLVED.html Carl Bridgewater]&lt;/ref&gt; but on 21 February 1997, the latest in a number of appeals finally saw the men's convictions overturned, after the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] ruled that the trial had been unfair, due to certain areas of evidence fabricated by police in order to persuade the now-deceased Molloy to make a confession. However, the Appeal Judges noted that in the light of Vincent Hickey's confessions to being present at the farm where Bridgewater was shot dead "we consider that there remains evidence on which a reasonable jury properly directed could convict." &lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;David Graves, "Bridgewater Four convictions quashed", ''Daily Telegraph'' 31 July 1997. ([https://web.archive.org/web/20021019064235/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1997%2F07%2F31%2Fnbri31.html Archived] web.archive.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, in the light of the judgment, the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] had decided not to apply for a retrial involving Vincent Hickey in the public interest nor proceed with an outstanding armed robbery charge against him. Hickey said, "My conviction has been quashed, so I am absolved and as far as I'm concerned that's the end of it."&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

The campaign to free and absolve the four men was led by Michael Hickey's mother, Ann Whelan, and campaigning journalist [[Paul Foot (journalist)|Paul Foot]]. Preparations were made for a case against four police officers in the Staffordshire force on charges of fabricating evidence, but the case was dropped in December 1998.

In a ruling condemned as "sick" by prison campaigners, the Court of Appeal agreed with a Home Office-appointed assessor that the cousins Michael and Vincent Hickey should lose a quarter of loss-of-earnings compensation for their free food and accommodation inside. This has set a precedent which is still being used by the Home Office.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Tibbetts, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1424354/Bridgewater-case-pair-appeal-over-prison-board-and-lodging.html "Bridgewater case pair appeal over prison 'board and lodging'"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 12 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson died on 30 August 2007 of [[lung cancer]] at the age of 73.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary - Jim Robinson|first=Melanie|last=McFadyean|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/sep/26/guardianobituaries.prisonsandprobation|accessdate=2012-03-13|location=London|date=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bert Spencer==
Over the years, convicted murderer Bert Spencer (born 1940) has been mentioned in the media as a possible suspect for the murder. Spencer, a uniformed ambulance driver who worked at [[Corbett Hospital]] in [[Stourbridge]] lived in [[Wordsley]] and was a very close neighbour of Carl (living only five doors away). He was investigated by police in the immediate aftermath of the murder, not least because he drove a blue [[Vauxhall Viva (1963–1979)|Vauxhall Viva]] - the same type of car which had been seen at the farm on the afternoon of the murder. Witnesses also said that the driver of the car was a uniformed man. Spencer had a shotgun licence and was regularly allowed to shoot at Yew Tree Farm. However, he was eliminated from police inquiries within a few months after the arrest of the four other suspects. Shortly afterwards, Spencer shot dead 70-year-old Hubert Wilkes at neighbouring Holloway Farm. Like Carl, Hubert Wilkes had been shot while sitting on a sofa. Spencer was jailed for life in 1980 and served 15 years before being paroled in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/IS+THIS+CARL'S+KILLER%3F%3B+asks+ex-Mirrorman+PAUL+FOOT+who+has...-a061105837|title=IS THIS CARL'S KILLER?; asks ex-Mirrorman PAUL FOOT who has campaigned for the release of the four men since they were first convicted.|work=thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spencer is featured in a book, ''Scapegoat for Murder: The Truth About the Killing of Carl Bridgewater'' (D&amp;B Publishing), written by true crime author, Simon W. Golding. The author invited [[criminologist]] [[David Wilson (criminologist)|Professor David Wilson]] to interview Spencer, and in June 2016, [[Channel 4]] screened a television documentary, ''Interview with a Murderer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Howard, David (director), Wilson, David (presenter) |date=2016 |title=Interview with a Murderer |medium=television documentary |language= |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/interview-with-a-murderer/on-demand/62882-001 |access-date= |format= |time= |location=United Kingdom |publisher=Channel 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Daily Telegraph review [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/06/12/interview-with-a-murderer-this-fascinating-duel-made-for-extraor/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Guardian review [https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/19/week-in-tv-interview-murderer-born-on-same-day-gogglesprogs-mum-bert-spender-david-wilson-murder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Evening Standard review [https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/interview-with-a-murderer-channel-4-criminologist-david-wilson-speaks-to-bert-spencer-suspected-of-a3269041.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the "interview of the year", Spencer's daughter revealed that she felt that her father was indeed at Yew Tree Farm on the day of Carl's killing "and possibly saw something". An ambulance station secretary (who was also a friend) who had provided the "cast iron" alibi that he had been "at work all day", admitted that she could not be sure that Spencer had not left at some point. Prof. Wilson, in his final meeting with Spencer, told him that he saw through Spencer's "kindly old grandfather schtick", adding that a [[ P-scan test]] indicated Spencer was a manipulative and callous psychopath.&lt;ref&gt;The Times - Monday June 2016, "Times 2" page 10&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary concluded with Prof. Wilson interviewing Spencer's former wife, who had not spoken publicly before. She said that the day after Carl's murder, Spencer told her he was disposing of his shotgun. She added that, Spencer having chosen to revive the issue to protest his innocence, it seemed likely that the police would reopen the case.&lt;ref&gt;The Times - Monday June 2016, "Times 2"page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4458">'''AB 1471''' or '''AB 1471 Crime Gun Identification Act of 2007''' is legislation passed by the California State Senate on September 6, 2007, and then by the California State Assembly on September 10, 2007, with votes of 21–17 and 43–29 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;"Microstamping Legislation Approved by California State Legislature." Coalition to Stop Gun Violence Press Release. 10 September 2007.[http://www.csgv.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=muLYJ7MMKrH&amp;b=2768811&amp;ct=4406131] Press Release&lt;/ref&gt;

It was then signed into law by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on October 13, 2007, becoming the first legislation of its kind to enact [[microstamping]] of firearms. Its implementation was then placed on hold.&lt;ref&gt;"Governor Schwarzenegger Signs Historic Crime-Fighting Legislation Into Law." Coalition To Stop Gun Violence Press Release. 14 October 2007 [http://www.csgv.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=muLYJ7MMKrH&amp;b=2768811&amp;ct=4515013] Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; The hold was lifted in 2013.

California's "unsafe firearm" laws, which include AB 1471, do not apply to any firearms used or purchased by any law enforcement agency.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. P.C. § 12125(b)(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

AB 1471 changes California definitions of "unsafe handgun" and also requires that:

"7) Commencing January 1, 2010, for all semiautomatic pistols that
are not already listed on the roster pursuant to Section 12131, it
is not designed and equipped with a microscopic array of characters
that identify the make, model, and serial number of the pistol,
etched or otherwise imprinted in two or more places on the interior
surface or internal working parts of the pistol, and that are
transferred by imprinting on each cartridge case when the firearm is
fired, provided that the Department of Justice certifies that the
technology used to create the imprint is available to more than one
manufacturer unencumbered by any patent restrictions. The Attorney
General may also approve a method of equal or greater reliability and
effectiveness in identifying the specific serial number of a firearm
from spent cartridge casings discharged by that firearm than that
which is set forth in this paragraph, to be thereafter required as
otherwise set forth by this paragraph where the Attorney General
certifies that this new method is also unencumbered by any patent
restrictions."&lt;ref&gt;California Legislation "Crime Gun Identification Act of 2007" AB 1471. [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1451-1500/ab_1471_bill_20070711_amended_sen_v96.html Legislation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Implementation of AB 1471 is currently on hold pending investigations into the feasibility of microstamping and patent encumberment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate= 2010-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Calguns Foundation, a gun rights group, paid to extend the lapsing patent on the technology to further delay the law from taking effect. Gene Hoffman, chairman of the group said, "It was a lot cheaper to keep the patent in force than to litigate over the issues." Hoffman added that he believed the law amounted to a gun ban in California. Todd Lizotte, the engineer who developed the technology, said he wanted the patents to lapse and the technology to be in the public domain. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On May 17, 2013, California Attorney General [[Kamala Harris]] announced that micro-stamping had cleared all technological and patenting hurdles and would be required on newly sold semiautomatics, effective immediately. However, handguns already approved for sale but lacking this technology may still be sold as long as they remain on the Roster of Not Unsafe Handguns.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Gun-control-Cartridge-ID-law-to-take-effect-4527165.php&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2412">A '''citizen legislature''' is a [[Legislature|legislative chamber]] made up primarily of citizens who have a full-time occupation besides being a legislator. Such citizen legislatures can be found on the state level, as in some [[U.S.]] states, or on the national level as in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="urlMiliz-Parlamentswissinfo.ch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/ger/die-legislative-ist-ein-miliz-parlament/162442 |title=Die Legislative ist ein Miliz-Parlament - SWI swissinfo.ch |format= |work= |accessdate=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislatures in the U.S. considered to be citizen legislatures include [[Idaho]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/about/citizenlegislature.htm Idaho State Legislature - Idaho's Citizen Legislature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Mexico]], [[North Carolina]], [[Oregon]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.or.us/ Oregon State Legislature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110195651/http://www.leg.state.or.us/ |date=January 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Utah]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://le.utah.gov/code/CONST/htm/00I06_001600.htm Utah Constitution - Article VI, Section 16 - Duration of sessions.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://legisweb.state.wy.us/leginfo/guide98.htm Citizen's Guide to the Legislature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Many other states in the US, by contrast, have a [[professional legislature]]. [[James Madison]] wrote in Federalist No. 62 that "It is not possible that an assembly of men called for the most part from pursuits of a private nature, continued in appointment for a short time, and led by no permanent motive to devote intervals of public occupation to a study of the laws, the affairs, and the comprehensive interests of their country, should, if left wholly to themselves, escape a variety of important errors in the exercise of their legislative trust."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa62.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11304">{{Cleanup|date=April 2009|reason=Reads like it was written a decade ago by [[WP:NOR|one person]] who is writing [[WP:NOTTEXTBOOK|in a textbook]] with different style guidelines [[WP:MOS|than Wikipedia's]] and which lacks a [[WP:NPOV|neutrality]] policy entirely.}}
'''Claims adjuster''' (claim adjuster), or '''claims handler''' (claim handler), investigates [[insurance claim]]s by interviewing the claimant and witnesses, consulting police and hospital records, and inspecting property damage to determine the extent of the company's liability.&lt;ref&gt;US Dept of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition, Claims Adjusters, Appraisers, Examiners, and Investigators&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[the Caribbean]] and [[New Zealand]] the term '''loss adjuster''' is used. Other claims adjusters who represent policyholders may aid in the preparation of an insurance claim.

In the United States, a claims adjuster's duties typically extend to include the following elements:
* Verify an insurance policy exists for the insured person and/or property. In general, these are written by the policy-holding insurance company.
* Risk(s) of loss(es), or damages to property, culminating in the loss of property and or bodily injury. 
* After completing the above investigations, evaluate the covered injuries and/or damages that have been determined according to the coverage grants.
* Negotiate a settlement according to the applicable law(s), and identify coverages for which the insured is covered, following best insurance practices.

A Claims adjuster or Public Adjuster does not, and should not, engage in the practice of law.  While adjusting the claim does mean applying the loss circumstances to the insured's policy, it does not account for if and when there becomes ''an issue of coverage'', which is a matter and practice of Law, and should only be engaged by a properly licensed attorney. 

In casualty insurance the main type of coverages include but may not be limited to the following:

* First party auto and other than auto coverages (sometimes referred to collision and comprehensive coverages) there are numerous types of first party insurance coverages for any kind of [[risk of loss]] or damages.
* Third party liability for property damage of others property and bodily injury. (in law terms these are "tort" claims)

== Classes ==
*Claim service representatives (employed by the insurance company, or an independent adjusting company).

In the two first instances, and the fourth, the adjuster operates on behalf of the insurer.

Adjusters may handle "property claims" involving damage to buildings and structures, or "liability claims" involving personal injuries or third-person property damage from liability situations, such as motor vehicle accidents, slip and falls, dog bites, or alleged negligent behavior. Some adjusters handle both types of claims and are known as "Multi-Line" adjusters. Also "All Lines Adjusters" may handle "any" type of claim already identified and also include professional liability, Hospital Professional Liability, Excess Liability, Physicians and Surgeons Liability, Aircraft Liability/Hull, Inland Marine, Ocean Marine, Boiler and Machinery, as well as various types of Bond Losses.

For a percentage of the settlement amount, [[Public adjuster]]s work exclusively for the policyholder. This means there should be no inherent conflict of interest when it comes to advocating on the policyholder's behalf to the insurance company.

An independent adjuster could be working for multiple insurance companies or self-insured entities. If licensed by state authority they represent pinnacle of property loss knowledge in their field; whether it be residential, vehicular, marine, etc.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

An adjuster will frequently verify that coverage applies through an insurance policy, investigate [[legal liability|liability]] for the damages caused, and make [[Damages|compensation]] to the injured person based on their emotional or physical property damages.

Specific duties include:
*Notifying the insurer of a covered loss as defined under the policy of insurance
*Responding to [[claim (legal)|claim]]s in a timely manner
*Filing paperwork
*Communicating with policy holders
*Investigate liability
*Assess [[property damage|damages]]
*Research, detail and substantiate each aspect of the claim, including building damage, contents, and extra living expense claims.
*Prepare a detailed damages report based on monthly updated insurance cost software for the purpose of making an offer of settlement to the insured.
*If needed for specialty cost coding, negotiate with product/service providers on time and cost of repairs for the purpose of making an offer of settlement to the insured.
*Ensuring accurate procedures
*Protect the interest of the insurance company the adjuster represents, when dealing with claimants.
*Computer skills with a high degree of proficiency.

Some states now require adjusters disclose to claimants whose interest specifically independent, staff and [[public adjuster]] represent, before they proceed with the policyholder.

Always check your local chapter of Licensed Public insurance adjusters, or state agency, in order qualify an adjuster is properly licensed and in good standing. Some of the state chapters are AAPIA and NAPIA. In Florida, the chapter is FAPIA.

IEA conducts certified online classes for people. The Insurance Institute of America also provides training leading to professional designations. Some states accept the Associate of Claims designation, and will waive the licensing examination, and grant a license by the state insurance commission. Some insurance carriers, and independent adjusting companies provide in house training certified by the state insurance commission. They must be pre-approved by the licensing division. An adjuster license is issued to those that pass the requirements.

==Education==
{{advertisement|date=November 2017}}
Many insurance companies prefer their claims adjusters to have a 4-year [[Bachelor's degree|college degree]] preferably in business related fields. In the past, high school graduates have become claims adjusters by promotion from within the claims department. Since there are no college majors for claims adjusters, many states require a state certification in order to practice as an adjuster. States also require that a certain number of continuing education credits for claims adjusters are earned each year in order to maintain their license. This continuing education is achieved by attending seminars and online training from different claim adjuster educational resources. There are also professional designations that have become prevalent among claims adjusters; for example, The American Institute for Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters awards the [[CPCU|Chartered Property and Casualty Underwriter (CPCU)]] designation to experienced underwriters.

Florida is one of the few states in the United States that has created specific designations for the licensing of insurance claims adjusters. The Accredited Claims Adjuster Designation, created by statute in coordination with Polk State College in 2002, allows an individual to obtain the Florida All Lines Independent or Company license, without taking the state licensing exam.

In some instances, such as with collapse insurance, courts have been involved in order to predicate a reasonable understanding of the guidelines of the policy in question. The meaning of terms such as "collapse" have undergone rigorous constitutional assessment.&lt;ref&gt;What Constitutes a Collapse Under A Property Insurance Policy? The Brief. Vol. 29, No. 2 (Winter 2000). American Bar Association. [http://www.rkmc.com/What_Constitutes_a_Collapse_under_a_Property_Insurance_Policy.htm Robins, Kaplan, Miller &amp; Ciresi, LLP]&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to some ambiguity between what the law says and what is enforceable by modern mandates. The idea of "Structural Integrity" may not always be a universally understood term, but several articles have been published on the topic&lt;ref name="adj_int"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.adjustersinternational.com/AdjustingToday/ATfullinfo.cfm?pdfID=52  |title= Insurance Coverage For Collapse - How It Has Changed and Why |accessdate= 2010-08-11 |publisher= Adjusters International }}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests the field is evolving toward a continuity in terminology. For those interested in the claims adjustment field, in-depth study of legal principle is a necessity.

Most states require licensed adjusters to continue their education through a "continuing education" requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdi.state.tx.us/licensing/contineduc/agent/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125202721/http://www.tdi.state.tx.us/licensing/contineduc/agent/index.html |archivedate=2010-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida requires 24 hours of CE every two years.&lt;ref name="FAPIA"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fapia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9:continuing-education-update&amp;catid=11:general-news&amp;Itemid=6 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723123951/http://www.fapia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9%3Acontinuing-education-update&amp;catid=11%3Ageneral-news&amp;Itemid=6 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2011-07-23 |title= Florida Public Adjuster Continuing Education Update |accessdate= 2009-09-28 |publisher= FAPIA |df=  }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Working conditions===
Claims adjusters work long hours including work nights and weekends. Their work is appointment based and must revolve around the needs of clients.&lt;ref name="CA_BOE_OOH" /&gt;

Staff adjusters are those who work for a specific insurance company and may either have a teams often enjoy this type of work as it allows them to work and travel together to different parts of the country. Adjusters should become familiar with the reimbursement rules for each company with whom they work and track all expenses used in the line of work.

Computer skills are essential, including keyboard skills. Most insurance companies store all documentation digitally. A digital camera is highly useful in documenting claims visually. Estimates, including auto and property losses, are prepared on computers connected to a corporate network. [[Laptop|Laptop computers]], [[Mobile phone|pad]], and other technologies make claims adjusting easier and consume less time. However, claims adjusting also requires a level of physical strength and stamina.

Property adjusters, for example, are often required to operate a 50-pound ladder and must stand, walk, kneel, crawl, and perform other physical demands as they investigate damaged property.&lt;ref name="CA_BOE_OOH"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos125.htm |title= Claims Adjusters, Appraisers, Examiners, and Investigators |accessdate= 2008-06-19 |date= 2007-12-12 |work= Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition |publisher= Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S.  Department of Labor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Commonwealth citizen}}

In general, a '''Commonwealth citizen''' is a citizen of a member state of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. This designation is given legal effect in the nationality laws of some Commonwealth countries, and Commonwealth citizens may enjoy some privileges in the [[United Kingdom]] and, less commonly, other member states. Each Commonwealth country determines what special rights, if any, are accorded to citizens of other Commonwealth countries. The status is most significant in British law and has little effect in many other Commonwealth countries, such as Australia.

In [[British nationality law]], a Commonwealth citizen is a person who is either a [[British citizen]], [[Indian citizen]], [[British Overseas citizen]], [[British subject]], [[British National (Overseas)]] or a national of a country listed in Schedule 3 of the [[British Nationality Act 1981]] (see below). Under the law, [[British protected person]]s are not Commonwealth citizens. The list of countries in Schedule 3 at any time may not accurately reflect the countries actually within the Commonwealth at that time. For example, when [[Fiji]] left the Commonwealth in 1987 and 1990, its name was not removed from Schedule 3. This may have happened because the British Government at the time wished to avoid the consequences of Fijian citizens in the United Kingdom suddenly losing the benefits of Commonwealth citizenship.

In the United Kingdom, Commonwealth citizens (together with Irish citizens and British protected persons) are in law considered not to be "foreign" or "aliens", although British protected persons do not have all the civic rights that are enjoyed by Commonwealth and Irish citizens. This reasoning has not carried over to some other Commonwealth countries – for example, in the [[High Court of Australia]] case of ''[[Sue v Hill]]'', other Commonwealth countries were held to be foreign powers, while in ''Nolan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs'', the nationals of other Commonwealth realms were held to be 'aliens'. In the United Kingdom, Commonwealth and Irish citizens enjoy the same civic rights as British citizens, namely:
* the right to vote in all elections (i.e., parliamentary, local, referendum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/649517/EU-referendum-2016-Voting-Voters-Allowed-British-Irish-Commonwealth-Citizens-European |}}&lt;/ref&gt; and European&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curia.europa.eu/en/actu/communiques/cp06/aff/cp060070en.pdf |format=PDF|title=Judgments of the Court in Cases C-145/04 and C-300/04 – Kingdom of Spain v United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland |publisher=The Court of Justice of the European Communities |date=12 September 2006 |accessdate=18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; elections) as long as they have [[Elections in the United Kingdom#Registration procedure|registered to vote]] (they must possess valid [[leave to enter]]/remain or [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|not require such leave]] on the date of their electoral registration application&lt;ref&gt;Representation of the People Act 1983, Section 4(6)&lt;/ref&gt;).
* the right, unless otherwise disqualified, to stand for election to the [[British House of Commons]] as long as they possess [[indefinite leave to remain]] or [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|do '''not''' require leave]] under the [[Immigration Act 1971]] to enter or remain in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[[Electoral Administration Act 2006]], Section 18&lt;/ref&gt;
* the right, if a qualifying peer or bishop, to sit in the [[House of Lords]].
* eligibility to hold public office (e.g., as a judge, magistrate, minister, police constable, member of the armed forces, etc.).

The disabilities of Commonwealth citizens who are not British citizens are few but, in the case of immigration control, very important. Commonwealth citizens (including British nationals who are not British citizens) who do not have the right of abode are subject to immigration control, including control on the right to work and carry out business. In addition, Commonwealth citizens who are not British citizens may not be engaged in certain sensitive occupations, e.g., in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], in the intelligence services, and some positions within the armed forces.

Nevertheless, under the United Kingdom's immigration arrangements Commonwealth citizens enjoy certain advantages:
* Commonwealth citizens born before 1 January 1983 may by virtue of having a parent born in the United Kingdom and Islands have the [[right of abode]] therein – such persons are exempt from all immigration control.
* Commonwealth citizens with a grandparent born in the United Kingdom and Islands may be admitted for up to five years on this basis, and thereafter be granted [[indefinite leave to remain]].
* Commonwealth citizens between the ages of 18 and 30 were eligible to be admitted for a "[[working holiday]]" for up to two years. This has since been replaced with the more restrictive Youth Mobility Scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/workingintheuk/tier5/youthmobilityscheme/ |title=UK Border Agency &amp;#124; Youth mobility scheme |publisher=Ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk |date=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now open only to youth of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and Monaco).
* Commonwealth citizens, unlike other non-[[European Economic Area]] nationals, may not be required to register with the police while living in the United Kingdom.

==Applicable countries under UK nationality law==

Countries whose citizens are Commonwealth citizens under Schedule 3 of the [[British Nationality Act 1981]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61 Schedule 3 : Countries whose citizens are Commonwealth citizens], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61 British Nationality Act 1981 (c. 61)], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk legislation.gov.uk].&lt;/ref&gt; although the list may not reflect the actual current membership in the Commonwealth, are as follows:

[[Maldives]] left the Commonwealth on 13 October 2016 and was removed from the schedule on 12 May 2017 by virtue of The British Nationality (Maldives) Order 2017.

==Privileges of Commonwealth citizens in other countries==
Although the rights and privileges (if any) for non-national Commonwealth citizens differ from country to country, a number of Commonwealth countries grant them more privileges than 'aliens' (i.e. non-Commonwealth foreign nationals), but not the full privileges enjoyed by the country's own nationals.

===Right to vote===
{{See also|Right of foreigners to vote}}
The following Commonwealth countries allow citizens from other Commonwealth countries to vote:
* {{flagcountry|Antigua and Barbuda}}. The Representation of the People (Amendment) Act (2002) permits Commonwealth citizens who have lived in Antigua and Barbuda for at least 3 years to register to vote in the constituency where they have resided for at least 1 month.
* {{flagcountry|Australia}}. Australia has abolished the status of [[British subject]] with effect from 26 January 1984. However, British subjects and Commonwealth citizens (excluding South African citizens) and Irish citizens who were on the federal electoral roll on 25 January 1984 can vote.

====British Overseas Territories====
The following Overseas Territories of the United Kingdom allow citizens from Commonwealth countries to vote:
* {{flagcountry|Bermuda}}. Non-Bermudian Commonwealth citizens who were registered to vote on 1 May 1976 are eligible to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.gov.bm/voting-faq.html Bermuda Parliamentary Registry: Voter Eligibility] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310104243/http://www.elections.gov.bm/voting-faq.html |date=10 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flagcountry|Gibraltar}}. Commonwealth citizens are eligible to vote in [[elections to the European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/7/section/16 European Parliament (Representation) Act 2003, Section 16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/articles/2004-05o.pdf European Parliamentary Elections Act 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Commonwealth citizens who used to live in Gibraltar but have moved elsewhere can register as an 'overseas elector' and vote in [[elections to the European Parliament]] provided that they were on the Register of Electors in Gibraltar within the past 15 years (the 15 years period begins when they no longer appeared in the Register of Electors, not the date they moved abroad). If they moved abroad before the age of 18, they can still qualify for registration as an 'overseas elector' in [[elections to the European Parliament]], with the 15 years period calculated from the date their parent(s)/guardian ceased to appear in the Register of Electors in Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/293/schedule/4/made The European Parliamentary Elections Regulations 2004, Schedule 4, Paragraph 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{flagcountry|Cayman Islands}}. The Cayman Islands is not a member of the Commonwealth as it is a British Overseas Territory and not a sovereign state. Commonwealth citizens who are not [[British Overseas Territories Citizen]]s by virtue of their connection to the Cayman Islands can still vote if on 31 January 1988 they were resident and on the electoral roll in the Islands, and either had a parent born in the Cayman Islands or was ordinarily resident in the Cayman Islands for 7 out of the 9 years preceding registration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionsoffice.ky/cms/registration-process/45-qualifications-disqualifications-of-an-elector Cayman Islands Elections Office: Qualifications and Disqualifications of an Elector] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719023437/http://www.electionsoffice.ky/cms/registration-process/45-qualifications-disqualifications-of-an-elector |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration benefits===

Some Commonwealth countries offer visa-free entry for short visits made by Commonwealth citizens. Some Commonwealth countries continue to allow Commonwealth citizens from other countries to become nationals/local citizens by ''registration'' rather than ''naturalisation'', upon preferential terms, e.g. with a shorter required period of residency, although this practice has been discontinued in some countries such as [[New Zealand nationality law#Historical provisions - 1949 to 1977|New Zealand]] and [[Maltese nationality law#Naturalisation as a Maltese citizen|Malta]].

In March 2013, it was announced by Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister, Ambassador Olugbenga Ashiru, that a visa free regime is being contemplated by Commonwealth countries for its members to strengthen trade and investment among member nations. As a prelude to accomplishing this, the council of ministers is to present a proposal for the exemption of holders of official and diplomatic passports from visa requirements at the next Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, CHOGOM, scheduled to hold in Colombo, Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name = "Commonwealth Plans Visa Free Regime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationng.com/2013/03/commonwealth-plans-visa-free-regime-for-member-states.html |title=Commonwealth Plans Visa Free Regime For Member States |publisher=Informationng.com |date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Commonwealth plans Visa-Free Policy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdayonline.com/NG/index.php/news/284-breaking-news/52582-commonwealth-plans-visa-free-policy-to-boost-trade-investment-among-member-states |title=Commonwealth plans visa-free policy to boost trade, investment among member states |publisher=Businessdayonline.com |date=5 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308054219/http://www.businessdayonline.com/NG/index.php/news/284-breaking-news/52582-commonwealth-plans-visa-free-policy-to-boost-trade-investment-among-member-states |archivedate=8 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement came in the wake of a meeting between Ashiru and the Secretary General of the Commonwealth, Kamalesh Sharma, in Abuja. At the meeting Ashiru and Sharma discussed proposals to make the Commonwealth more relevant to its citizens across the globe including ways the Commonwealth could ease free movement across member countries, strengthen institutions, enhance education, create job opportunities, facilitate development and enhance the living standard of the citizens across the countries of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name = "Commonwealth Plans Visa Free Regime" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Commonwealth plans Visa-Free Policy" /&gt;

Ashiru said, "We also discussed the issue of free movement to promote people to people contact within the Commonwealth. In the past, it used to be that holders of Commonwealth passports could travel within the Commonwealth countries easily without having to go and queue for visas. We are now thinking for ways to ensure that we bring back this old tradition of the Commonwealth. Already, the council of ministers have recommended for approval at the next CHOGOM meeting in Colombo the exemption of holders of official and diplomatic passports within the Commonwealth from the requirement of a visa if they are travelling within the Commonwealth."&lt;ref name = "Commonwealth Plans Visa Free Regime" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Commonwealth plans Visa-Free Policy" /&gt;

When approved, he said, other categories of professionals and businessmen would be recommended for similar privileges.&lt;ref name = "Commonwealth Plans Visa Free Regime" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Commonwealth plans Visa-Free Policy" /&gt;

===Other rights===
* The right to work in any position (including the civil service) in some instances, except for certain specific positions (e.g. defence, [[Governor-General]] or President, Prime Minister).
* Eligibility to serve in the armed forces of certain countries.
* Eligibility for the [[Commonwealth Scholarship]].

==Consular assistance==
{{See also|Consular assistance}}
In foreign (i.e. non-Commonwealth) countries, the British embassy or consulate is traditionally responsible for Commonwealth citizens whose governments are not represented in the country concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/224126/FCOBritsAbroadA4_0713xx.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019062503/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/224126/FCOBritsAbroadA4_0713xx.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few Commonwealth governments have made alternative arrangements to share the burden, such as the [[Canada-Australia Consular Services Sharing Agreement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
|url=http://www.voyage.gc.ca/laws_lois/australia-canada-australie-eng.asp
|title=Canada-Australia Consular Services Sharing Agreement
|publisher=Government of Canada
|accessdate=14 December 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence for Canadian and Australian citizens, the British embassy or consulate only provides assistance if neither country is represented. In return, there are a few Australian consulates that are responsible for British nationals because there is no British consulate there. Some Commonwealth governments, such as Singapore and [[Tanzania]], have opted not to receive consular assistance from the United Kingdom.

In other Commonwealth countries, British [[High Commission]]s accept no responsibility for unrepresented Commonwealth citizens, who should look to the host Commonwealth government for quasi-consular assistance. Canadian and Australian citizens are still able to seek consular assistance from each other's high commissions. Additionally, Canadian citizens can seek consular assistance at any British embassy or high commission where Canada is not represented.

===Commonwealth citizen travel documents===

Commonwealth citizens outside the UK are eligible to apply for a [[British emergency passport|British emergency travel document]] if they need to travel urgently and their passport has been lost/stolen/expired (as long as the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|FCO]] has cleared this with the government of the Commonwealth citizen's home country).&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121212135632/http://centralcontent.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/central-content-pdfs/5619320/etd-leaflet.pdf Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office: The new UK Emergency Passport]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a British embassy or consulate in a foreign country is required to provide a replacement passport to a Commonwealth citizen whose government is unrepresented in that country, it will issue a British passport with the nationality of the holder marked as "Commonwealth citizen".&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5325">The '''Composers, Authors and Publishers Association of Canada''' ({{lang-fr|'''Association des compositeurs, auteurs et éditeurs du Canada Ltée'''}}) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[copyright collective]] for the right to communicate with the public and publicly perform musical works. CAPAC administered these rights on behalf of its members (composers, lyricists, songwriters, and their publishers) and those of affiliated international organizations by licensing the use of their music in Canada.&lt;ref name="Designs1957"&gt;{{cite book|author=Canada. Royal Commission on Patents, Copyright, Trade Marks and Industrial Designs|title=Report on copyright|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jN5DAQAAIAAJ|year=1957|publisher=E. Cloutier, Queen's printer|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Royalties were paid to the music creators after administration costs were deducted to pay for the operation of CAPAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YfkiAQAAMAAJ|date=September 1974|publisher=Billboard Publications|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CAPAC was established as a subsidiary of Great Britain's [[Performing Rights Society]] (PRS) under the name the '''Canadian Performing Rights Society''' (CPRS) in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0000603 "CAPAC"]. ''[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Its initial purpose was to administer the royalties of composers, lyricists and music publishers whose creations were performed in Canada, be they native Canadians or foreigners. The [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] bought partial ownership of the CPRS in 1930. In 1945 CPRS became CAPAC through the [[Supplementary Letters Patent]]. 

CAPAC developed a schedule under which broadcasters and cinema owners paid royalties for each playing of CAPAC music,&lt;ref name=bill&gt;{{cite book|title=On New Canada Logging System|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6AYjAQAAMAAJ|date=October 1950|publisher=Billboard Publications|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; while live music venues were required to purchase music performance licenses.&lt;ref name="Pitman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Pitman|title=Louis Applebaum: A Passion for Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3y9YKq2RoDUC&amp;pg=PA217|date=1 October 2002|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-55002-985-7|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royalties were also collected when music was used in advertisements.&lt;ref name="HowellVincent1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert G. Howell|author2=Linda Vincent|author3=Michael D. Manson|title=Intellectual property law: cases and materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0llnxbjL4sC|year=1999|publisher=E. Montgomery|isbn=978-1-55239-009-2|page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 CPAC changed its method of assessment from logging individual performances to collecting a percentage of revenues.&lt;ref name=bill /&gt; Over the next few years the organization came into conflict with the Canadian Association of Broadcasters as well as a number of private supper clubs, who objected to paying the royalties and license fees assessed by CAPAC.&lt;ref name="Inc.1953"&gt;{{cite book|title=CAPAC Seen Winning Rate Fight vs CAB|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA14%7Cdate%3D10+January+1953%7Cpublisher%3DNielsen+Business+Media%2C+Inc.%7Cpage%3D14%7Cid%3D%7B%7BISSN%7C00062510%7D%7D%7D%7D%3C%2Fref%3E|date=10 January 1953|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=14–|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the issue was in the courts, both the stations and the clubs were enjoined from playing any CAPAC music unless they paid a percentage of their revenue to CAPAC.&lt;ref name="Inc.1952"&gt;{{cite book|title=CAPC and CAB reach agreement|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jx4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA17|date=24 May 1952|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=17–|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inc.1953" /&gt; In 1955 the Supreme Court ruled that radio stations could decide either to pay 1% of their revenue to CAPAC or refrain from using CAPAC music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supreme Court Favors CAPAC in Copyright Fight|work=Broadcasting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdJDAQAAIAAJ|volume=47|date=October 1954|publisher=Broadcasting Publications.|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radio Daily-television Daily|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tMRAQAAMAAJ|year=1956|publisher=Radio Daily Corporation|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1976 CAPAC had about 6,000 members and revenue of about $10 million.&lt;ref name="Inc.1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pSQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT59|date=6 November 1976|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=59|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the organization merged with the [[Performing Rights Organization of Canada Limited]] to form the [[Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada]].&lt;ref name="Pitman2002" /&gt;

Under this test, the product is considered defective if a reasonable consumer would find it defective.  As an example, a reasonable consumer might find exposed blades on a lawnmower, without plastic guards that could be installed for pennies, to be defective because the risk of not having the plastic guards is higher than the costs of installing those guards.  

The test is mostly applied to non-complex products about which consumers might have expectations.  For example, the consumer might not have specific safety expectations about the design of landing gear on an airplane except for the fact that they do not expect to crash while taking the plane.

A closely related test is [[risk-utility test]]. Traditionally, the risk-utility test was used for design defects, while the consumer expectation test was applied to manufacturing defects.  However, some jurisdictions apply the consumer expectation test to design defects as well.  ''See'' Calles v. Scripto-Tokai Corp., 2007 WL 495315 (Ill. Feb. 16, 2007). 

Official definition of consumer expectation test: An unreasonably dangerous product is one that is dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community of its characteristics. 

This test is commonly applied in product liability cases in the United States. 

In the European Union, the European Council Directive on General Product Safety 2001/95/EC states (at Article 3(f)) that the conformance of a product to a general safety requirement shall be assessed taking into account "reasonable customer expectations regarding safety" (amongst other considerations).

The '''Crown Proceedings Act 1947''' (c. 44) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that allowed, for the first time, [[civil action]]s against [[the Crown]] to be brought in the same way as against any other party. The Act also reasserted the [[common law]] doctrine of [[Crown privilege]] but by making it, for the first time, [[justiciable]] paved the way for the development of the modern law of [[public interest immunity]].

The Act received the [[royal assent]] on 31 July 1947 but did not fully come into force until 1 January 1948.&lt;ref&gt;SI1947/2527, art.1&lt;/ref&gt;

There remain significant differences between [[Crown proceedings]] and claims between private parties, especially as to enforcement of judgments.

==Background==
Before the Act, the Crown could not be [[lawsuit|sue]]d in contract. However, as it was seen to be desirable that Crown contractors could obtain redress, they would otherwise be inhibited from taking on such work, so a [[petition of right]] came to be used in such situations, especially after the [[Petitions of Right Act 1860]] simplified the process.&lt;ref name="BnE"&gt;Bradley &amp; Ewing (2003) ''pp''700-701&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the petition could be heard by the courts, it had to be endorsed with the words ''[[fiat justitia]]'' on the advice of the [[Home Secretary]] and [[Attorney-General]].&lt;ref name="BnE"/&gt;

Similarly, the Crown could not be sued in [[tort]]. The usual remedy was for the complainant to sue the public servant responsible for the injury. A famous example was the case of ''[[Entick v Carrington]]''. The Crown usually indemnified the servant against any [[damages]].

[[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] called for equality between Crown and subjects in a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] motion in 1828 but it was to be a further century before the proposal was realised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Statesmen of Science | author=Crowther, J. G. | location=London | year=1965 | publisher=Cresset Press | pages=65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Government departments came up with a range of pragmatic devices to mitigate some of the effects of Crown immunity,&lt;ref&gt;TT Arvind 'Restraining the State through Tort? The Crown Proceedings Act in Retrospect' in TT Arvind and Jenny Steele (eds.), ''Tort Law and the Legislature'' (Hart 2013), pp. 415-8.&lt;/ref&gt; and although these left many problems unaddressed, many lawyers and politicians believed that the law generally struck a good balance.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind 2013, pp. 406-10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 a Crown Proceedings Committee was established, following a campaign by the legal profession which was also supported by the Law Officers of the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind 2013, pp. 420-1&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee was chaired by [[Lord Hewart]]. The Committee was deeply divided on the question of whether the Crown should be made liable in tort, but was instructed by the Lord Chancellor to draft a bill on the basis that it was desirable, leaving the political question to be decided by the Government once the bill had been prepared.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind 2013, pp. 422-423&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee produced a draft [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] in 1927. However, little was done to progress it through Parliament due to opposition within the Government (primarily from Admiralty and [[Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham|Viscount Hailsham]].)&lt;ref&gt;Arvind 2013, pp. 424-425&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, there was adverse criticism of the state of affairs from the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]&lt;ref&gt;''Adams v. Naylor'' [1946] AC 543&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]].&lt;ref name="street"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Royster v. Cavey'' [1947] KB 204&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also political pressure on the Labour government from the trade unions, who feared that Crown immunity would severely affect the rights of workers in nationalised industries.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind 2013, pp. 426&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lord Chancellor, Lord Jowitt, also believed that it was politically important to demonstrate that the Labour government was committed to maintaining the rights of citizens against the State.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind 2013, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;  The result was that the Act was made a priority, and passed through Parliament in 1947 with little controversy and to general acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind 2013, p. 427&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Act==

===Actions allowed===
Section 1 of the Act allows claims, for which a petition of right would previously have been demanded, to be brought in the courts directly as against any other defendant. However, a petition and ''fiat'' still appear to be necessary for personal claims against the monarch.&lt;ref name="BnE"/&gt;

Section 2 renders the Crown liable as though it were a [[natural person]] for:
*[[Tort]]s committed by its [[servants and agents]];
*[[British labour law|Common law duties of an employer to its servants and agents]]; and
*[[Occupiers' liability|Common law duties as an owner or occupier of property]].

Section 2(2) provides that the Crown is liable for [[breach of statutory duty]] so long as the statute binds both the Crown and private persons.

Section 3 provides for the protection of [[patent]]s, registered [[trade mark]]s, [[design right]]s and [[copyright]]s from breach by Crown servants.

===Limitations===
Section 2(5) exempts the Crown from liability for any person exercising "responsibilities of a judicial nature". This means, for example, that a claim under the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] may not be brought against the Crown with respect to judicial decisions, unless it is brought within a right of appeal according to Section 9 of that Act.

Section 10 exempted the Crown from actions for death or [[personal injury]] caused by members of the [[British Armed Forces]] to other members of the British Armed Forces. This section was suspended by the [[Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act 1987]], sections 1 and 2 with a power for the [[Secretary of State for Defence]] to revive it when "necessary and expedient".&lt;ref&gt;Bradley &amp; Ewing (2003) ''p.''758-759&lt;/ref&gt; There was some retrospective litigation after the 1987 Act in which a declaration was made under the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], section 4 that such immunity was compatible with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], article 6(1).&lt;ref&gt;''Matthews v. Ministry of Defence'' [2002] All ER (D) 137 (Jan)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crown privilege and Public Interest Immunity===
Section 28 gave the courts, for the first time, the power to order [[discovery (law)|disclosure]] of documents by the Crown and require the Crown to answer [[requests for further information]]. This new power is subject to important qualifications in s.28(2) including the proviso that the Crown can resist disclosure where this could be “injurious to the public interest”. This reasserted the traditional doctrine of Crown privilege but also made the issue justiciable, ultimately giving rise to the doctrine of [[public-interest immunity]].

===Proceedings abolished===
Apart from [[petitions of right]], the Act abolished several ancient [[writ]]s and procedures:&lt;ref&gt;Ss.21, 23/ Sch.1&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Latin information]]s and [[English information]]s;
*Writs of ''[[capias ad respondendum]]'', ''[[subpoena ad respondendum]]'' and [[writ of appraisement|writs of appraisement]];
*Writs of ''[[scire facias]]'';
*Proceedings for the determination of any issue upon a [[writ of extent]] or of ''[[diem clausit extremum]]'';
*Writs of [[summons]] under Part V of the [[Crown Suits Act 1865]];
*Proceedings against the Crown by way of ''[[monstrans de droit]]''.

==Amendments since royal assent==
Sections 5 to 8 originally covered [[Admiralty law|Admiralty]] claims but these sections were repealed and replaced by provisions under the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1995]].

Section 9 originally excluded claims arising from the operations of the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|Post Office]], including telegraphic and telephone services, other than the loss or damage of a registered letter. These provisions were repealed and replaced by the [[Post Office Act 1969]].&lt;ref&gt;c. 48, Sch. 11 Pt. II&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The [[fragging]] '''deaths of Phillip Esposito and Louis Allen''' occurred on June 7, 2005, at [[Forward Operating Base Danger]] in [[Tikrit]], [[Iraq]].  [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Phillip Esposito and [[First Lieutenant]] Louis Allen, from a [[New York Army National Guard]] unit of the [[United States]] [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]], were mortally wounded in Esposito's office by a [[Claymore mine]] and died.

Military investigators determined that the mine was deliberately placed in the window and detonated to kill Esposito and Allen. [[Staff Sergeant]] Alberto B. Martinez, who was in the officers' unit, was charged with two counts of [[premeditated murder]]. In 2006, two years before the trial, Martinez volunteered in a [[plea bargain]] to plead guilty to murder in exchange for a [[life sentence without parole]]; Lt. Gen. [[John Vines]], commander of the Army’s [[18th Airborne Corps]] and the [[convening authority]], rejected the deal. In the court martial, Martinez was acquitted on December 4, 2008 at [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]].

The case was one of only two publicly known alleged [[fragging]] incidents among American forces during the [[Iraq War]] and the only one to take place in Iraq, in contrast to numerous incidents among United States forces during the [[Vietnam War]] of the 1960s and early 70s. In April 2005, Sergeant [[Hasan Akbar case|Hasan Karim Akbar]] was convicted on charges of [[premeditated murder]] and sentenced to death for the first incident, which took place in March 2003 in [[Kuwait]]. 

==Attack==
On the evening of June 7, 2005, Captain Phillip Esposito, 30, and First Lieutenant Louis Allen, 34, were playing the board game ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]'' in Esposito's office in the Water Palace building on the United States Forward Operating Base (FOB) Danger in [[Tikrit, Iraq]]. The officers were from the Headquarters and Headquarters Company of the [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]], a [[New York Army National Guard]] unit from [[Troy, New York]]; it was deployed to Iraq in support of American operations in the [[Iraq War]]. Esposito was the company commander and had been stationed in Iraq about six months. Allen was the company's new operations officer; he had arrived in the unit just four days before.&lt;ref name="hearing"/&gt;

At 10 p.m., a [[M18A1 Claymore mine]] placed next to the window of Esposito's office exploded, blasting 700 steel ball bearings into the office space and fatally wounding the two officers.&lt;ref name="zuc2widows"&gt;{{cite web

==Victims==
*Philip Esposito, a [[project manager]] for [[Smith Barney]] in [[Manhattan]], lived in [[Suffern, New York]] with his wife and 18-month-old daughter. He was a graduate of the [[United States Military Academy at West Point]].&lt;ref name="zuc2widows"/&gt; More than 500 people attended his funeral on June 16, 2005 after his body was returned home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Focus on Martinez==
[[File:SSG Alberto B Martinez.jpg|thumbnail|right|In 2005, Army prosecutors accused Staff Sergeant Alberto B. Martinez of Schaghticoke, New York, (above), of murdering Captain Phillip Esposito and First Lieutenant Louis Allen. An XVIII Airborne Corps court-martial subsequently acquitted Martinez of all charges on December 4th, 2008.]]
Military investigators initially thought that the two officers were killed by an [[insurgent]] mortar or rocket attack. When they determined that the blast was deliberately caused by a hand-placed explosive device, they began looking for suspects. Learning that Staff Sergeant Alberto B. Martinez, 37, had made numerous threats against Esposito, and based on their investigation, they arrested and charged him with two counts of premeditated murder. This happened the same week in June that Esposito and Allen were buried in their home towns.&lt;ref name="FOBdanger"&gt;{{cite web

From [[Schaghticoke (town), New York|Schaghticoke, New York]] near [[Troy, New York|Troy]], Martinez is married with two children.&lt;ref name="FOBdanger"/&gt; He had joined the National Guard in 1990 and been assigned to Iraq in 2004.&lt;ref name="FOBdanger"/&gt;  He was serving as the supply sergeant of the unit headed by Esposito and Allen.&lt;ref name="zuc2widows"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vonZiel"/&gt;

Esposito and Martinez had come into conflict before arriving in Tikrit in April 2004, as Esposito tried to bring the sergeant in line.&lt;ref name="FOBdanger"/&gt; Martinez was later described in court "as a poorly disciplined and foul-mouthed guardsman who needed a special waiver to qualify for duty."&lt;ref name="zuc2widows"/&gt; Witnesses testified that Martinez "could not account for hundreds of thousands of dollars in missing equipment."&lt;ref name="zuc2widows"/&gt; Esposito eventually restricted Martinez from going into the supply area without an escort.&lt;ref name="zuc2widows"/&gt; Martinez feared Esposito would get him kicked out of the Guard, costing him $2,859 in monthly pay.&lt;ref name="zuc2widows"/&gt;

Witnesses later testified that Martinez had openly threatened to kill Esposito. The captain  had already disciplined Martinez for poor job performance; he had also initiated proceedings that might have resulted in Martinez being discharged from the military or removed from his full-time Guard position.&lt;ref name="vonZiel"/&gt; Esposito was considered the target of the attack, as Allen had arrived in the unit in Tikrit only days before.&lt;ref name="FOBdanger"/&gt; Witnesses placed Martinez in the vicinity of the Water Palace shortly after the explosion.&lt;ref name="zuc2widows"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vonZiel"/&gt;

==Proceeding to trial==
In October and November 2005, the military held an [[Article 32 hearing]], similar to a [[grand jury]] hearing, in [[Kuwait]] rather than Tikrit, in order to allow the wives of Martinez, Esposito and Allen to attend; all three did. In addition, the Army arranged for transmission of an audio link of the two-day proceedings to [[West Point]] to allow other family members in the area to follow them.&lt;ref name="hearing"/&gt;

Nine witnesses testified. Colonel Patrick Reinert recommended a general [[court-martial]] for Martinez on murder charges based on the evidence presented.&lt;ref name="hearing"&gt;{{cite web

In early 2006 Martinez learned of additional evidence against him. This included testimony from a soldier who said she had given Martinez Claymore mines and grenades shortly before the killings. On April 3, 2006, he [[Plea bargain|volunteered to plead guilty]] to murder in exchange for a life sentence with the possibility of [[parole]] after 10 years. But, Lieutenant General [[John Vines]], commander of the [[XVIII Airborne Corps (United States)|XVIII Airborne Corps]] and [[convening authority]] over the legal proceedings, rejected the plea agreement. Vines sent the case to court-martial under two counts of premeditated murder, Article 118 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]].&lt;ref name="vonZiel"&gt;{{cite web

In April 2007 the defense asked for more time to prepare its case and presented the judge with four motions. In addition to the charges of premeditated murder, at the time Martinez was charged with one count each of wrongful possession of a privately owned firearm, unexploded ordnance, and alcohol. The other charge against him was for wrongfully giving government property, in this case printers and copiers, to an Iraqi national. One of the defense motions was to sever the murder charges from the others. The case was scheduled to go to trial in August 2007.&lt;ref name="defTime"&gt;[http://www.militarytimes.com/news/2007/04/army_fragger_Martinez_070418w/ Staff, "Defense for alleged fragger asks for more time"], ''[[Military Times]]'', 18 April 2007, accessed 15 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, the defense asked the judge to dismiss the murder charges, because of what they alleged was the prosecutor trying to influence a witness who could help the defense. The judge refused the request.&lt;ref name="APjudge"&gt;{{cite web

The court-martial was held at [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]], beginning in October 2008, with Colonel Stephen Henley sitting as the trial judge. During the trial, Sergeant Sandra Pelton, a 42nd Division cook, testified for the prosecution that Martinez twice mentioned [[fragging]] when he came through her dining facility a few days before the explosion. On one occasion when Pelton asked Martinez how he was doing, he made a noise simulating an explosion and said, "Frag him, frag. I mean it."&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite web

Martinez's defense team countered that the Army's evidence against Martinez was circumstantial, and prosecution witnesses' testimonies were inconsistent. The defense team also presented evidence that Martinez was not the only soldier in the unit with a grudge against Esposito.  After two days of deliberations, the jury acquitted Martinez on December 4, 2008. In the military, a two-thirds vote by the jury is needed for conviction. The prosecutor in the case speculated that some jurors' known opposition to the death penalty may have influenced their votes for acquittal.&lt;ref name="vonZiel" /&gt;

==Acquittal and honorable discharge==
Soon after his acquittal, Martinez received an honorable discharge from the National Guard. Publicly, Martinez "proclaimed his innocence and a sense of vindication."&lt;ref name="vonZiel" /&gt; Military prosecutors repeated their belief in Martinez's guilt.&lt;ref name="vonZiel" /&gt;

In 2009, a report in ''The New York Times'' revealed that Martinez had offered in 2006 to plead guilty to 2nd-degree murder in an attempted plea bargain that was ultimately rejected by the government.&lt;ref name="vonZiel" /&gt; Martinez's guilty plea offer was signed by his two Army defense lawyers who were permitted by Army regulations to sign the plea offer only if they believed at the time that Martinez committed the crime. Subsequent debate was twofold: one question arose over whether the government's pursuit of the [[death penalty]] may lead defendants to plead to crimes they have not committed in order to avoid death as a punishment. Another question focused on the alleged inflexibility of the military's punishment scheme, as the government had apparently rejected Martinez's 2006 plea on the grounds that Martinez would have been eligible for parole within 10 years if sentenced to life, even after pleading guilty to 2nd-degree murder in the slaying of the two officers.&lt;ref name="vonZiel" /&gt;

In 2009, Barbara Allen initiated an effort to compel the Army to award the [[Purple Heart]] to her husband for his slaying. Allen unsuccessfully petitioned the Military Awards Board and the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] for a hearing on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.armytimes.com/story/military/2015/11/09/slain-soldiers-wife-renews-fight-purple-heart/75473066/|title=slain-soldiers-wife-renews-fight-purple-heart|last=Times|first=Army|website=Army Times|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2017, the Army has denied her request, citing the lack of a "nexus to enemy action" that would merit an awarding of the medal. Allen also wrote a memoir&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/barbara-allen/front-toward-enemy/|title=Front Toward Enemy by Barbara Allen {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; about her experiences in the face of her husband's death, Martinez's court-martial, and his acquittal. 

On January 22, 2017, Alberto Martinez died in Florida of unspecified causes. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://m.timesunion.com/local/article/Ex-Schaghticoke-soldier-acquitted-of-2005-10886965.php|title=Alberto Martinez, soldier acquitted of killing superiors, dies|newspaper=Times Union|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The case was one of only two publicly known instances of U.S. Army [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] soldiers charged with intentionally killing superior officers during the Iraq war, and the only one to occur in Iraq.

To date, the Army has not publicly identified or charged any other individual in Esposito and Allen's slaying.&lt;ref name="vonZiel" /&gt;

A '''dignitary tort''' is type of [[intentional tort]] where the cause of action is being subjected to certain kinds of indignities.{{sfn|Goldberg|Sebok|Zipursky|2004}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}} Historically, this category of torts was often covered by the old [[England|English]] writ of trespass ''[[vi et armis]]''.

Historically, the primary dignitary torts were [[Battery (tort)|battery]], [[assault (tort)|assault]], and [[false imprisonment]], as each claimed harm to a person's human [[dignity]]. A cause of action could be brought for battery, for example, even if no injury was done to the plaintiff, so long as the contact would be offensive to a reasonable person. Under modern jurisprudence the category of dignitary torts is more closely associated with secondary dignitary torts, most notably [[defamation]] (slander and libel), [[false light]], [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]], [[invasion of privacy]], and [[alienation of affections]]. In some jurisdictions, the phrase is limited to those torts which do not require physical injury or threat of physical injury, limiting the class to only those secondary incidents.

The only non-intentional act classified as a dignitary tort is [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]], although this is also sometimes classified as simply another form of [[negligence]].

[[File:Proikosymfono Kastoria 1905.JPG|thumb|Dower agreement (Proikosymfono) before wedding at Kastoria, Greece, (1905). Source: Folkloric Museum of Kastoria]]

'''Dower''' is a provision accorded by law, but traditionally by a husband or his family, to a wife for her support in the event that she should become  [[widow]]ed. It was [[settlement (law)|settled]] on the bride (being gifted into [[trust instrument|trust]]) by agreement at the time of the wedding, or as provided by law.

The dower grew out of the Germanic practice of [[bride price]] ([[Old English]] ''weotuma''), which was given over to a bride's family well in advance for arranging the marriage, but during the early Middle Ages, was given directly to the bride instead. However, in popular parlance, the term may be used for a [[life interest]] in property settled by a husband on his wife at any time, not just at the wedding. The verb [[wikt:dower#Verb|''to dower'']] is sometimes used''.''

In popular usage, the term ''dower'' may be confused with:
*A ''[[dowager]]'' is a widow (who may receive her dower). The term is especially used of a noble or royal widow who no longer occupies the position she held during the marriage. For example, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] was technically the [[dowager queen]] after the death of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] (though she was referred to by the more informal title "[[Queen Mother]]"), and [[Princess Lilian, Duchess of Halland|Princess Lilian]] was the Dowager Duchess of Halland in [[heraldry|heraldic]] parlance. Such a dowager will receive the income from her dower property. (The term "[[Empress dowager|Empress Dowager]]", in Chinese history, has a different meaning.)
*Property brought to the marriage by the bride is called a ''[[dowry]]''.  But the word ''dower'' has been used since [[Chaucer]] (''[[The Clerk's Tale]]'') in the sense of ''dowry'', and is recognized as a definition of ''dower'' in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].
*Property made over to the bride's family at the time of the wedding is a ''[[bride price]]''. This property does not pass to the bride herself.

==Meaning==
Being for the widow and being accorded by law, dower differs essentially from a conventional marriage portion such as the [[England|English]] [[dowry]] (cf.  [[Roman law|Roman]] ''dos'', [[Byzantine law|Byzantine]] ''proíx'', [[France|French]] ''dot'', Dutch ''bruidsschat'', [[Germany|German]] ''Mitgift'').

The bride received a right to certain property from the bridegroom or his family. It was intended to ensure her livelihood in widowhood, and it was to be kept separate and in the wife's possession.

Dower is the gift given by the groom to the bride, customarily on the morning after the wedding, though all dowerings from the man to his fiancée, either during the betrothal period, or wedding, or afterwards, even as late as in the testamentary dowering, are understood as dowers if specifically intended for the maintenance of the widow.

Dower was a property arrangement for marriage first used in early medieval German cultures, and the Catholic Church drove its adoption into other countries, in order to improve the wife's security by this ''additional'' benefit. The practice of dower was prevalent in those parts of Europe influenced by [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[Scandinavia]]n culture, such as Sweden, Germany, Normandy and successor states of the Langobardian kingdom.

The husband was legally prevented from using the wife's dower — as contrasted with her [[dowry]], which was brought to the marriage by the bride and used by both spouses. This often meant that the woman's legal representative, usually a male relative, became guardian or [[executor]] of the dower, to ensure that it was not squandered.

Usually, the wife was free from kin limitations to use (and bequeath) her dower to whatever and whomever she pleased. It may have become the property of her next marriage, been given to an ecclesiastical institution, or been inherited by her children from other relationships than that from which she received it.

==Types==
In English legal history, there were originally five kinds of dower:&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Dower |volume=8|page=457|first=Harold Spencer|last=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone (2009), The Commentaries of Sir William Blackstone, Knight, on the Laws, Constitution of England; {{ISBN|978-1-60442-719-6}}; pages 105-111&lt;/ref&gt; (1) ''ad ostium ecclesiae'', or at the church porch; (2) ''ex assensu patris''; (3) ''de la plus belle''; (4) at common law; (5) by custom.

# ''Dower ad ostium ecclesiae'', was the closest to modern meaning of dower. It was the property secured by law, in bride's name at the church porch (where marriages used to take place). This was optional. Dower wasn't the same as bride price; rather, it was legal assignment of movable or fixed property that became the bride's property. 
# ''Dower de la plus belle'' was a hereditary conveyance of tenure by [[knight-service|knight service]]. It was abolished in 1660, by the act which did away with old tenures.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
# ''Dower ex assensu patris'', was the dower given to the bride by the father of the bridegroom. This became obsolete long before it was formally abolished (in the United Kingdom, for example, by the Dower Act 1834).
# At common law, dower was of a very different nature. It was a legal declaration of a wife's right to property, while the husband lived, which he would manage; which would transfer to the wife's children when they were born; and which would secure her livelihood were she widowed. A dower at common law was not liable for the husband's debts — which became controversial after many tried to use it to shield their property from the collection of debts. The Dower Acts of 19th century abolished this.
# Dower by custom was an attempt to recognize the rules of dower customary at each manor and in each region. Customary dowers were also abolished in the 19th century, and replaced with uniform inheritance laws.

==History==

===Roman era===
Dower is thought to have been suggested by the bride price which [[Tacitus]] found to be usual among the [[Germans]]. This bride price he terms ''dos'', but contrasts it with the ''dos'' (dowry) of the Roman law, which was a gift on the part of the wife to the husband, while in [[Germany]] the gift was made by the husband to the wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Larousse|Larousse]], ''[[Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle|Grand dictionnaire universel]]'', Paris, 1870, s.v. ''Douaire''&lt;/ref&gt; There was indeed in the Roman law what was termed ''donatio propter nuptias'', a gift from the family of the husband, but this was only required if the ''dos'' were brought on the part of the wife. So too in the special instance of a widow (herself poor and undowried) of a husband rich at the time of his death, an ordinance of the Christian [[Emperor Justinian]] secured her the right to a part of her husband's property, of which no disposition of his could deprive her.

===Establishment in Western Europe===
[[File:Cordelia's Portion.jpg|240px|thumb|right|"Thy truth, then, be thy dower". [[King Lear]]]]

The general establishment of the principle of dower in the customary law of [[Western Europe]], according to [[Henry James Sumner Maine|Maine]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry James Sumner Maine|Maine]], ''[[Ancient Law]]'', 3rd American edition, [[New York City]], 1887, 218&lt;/ref&gt; is to be traced to the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] (no evidence of this whatsoever dower payments evolved from Germanic custom of paying a brideprice, which over centuries morphed into the bridegift, was in place long before the church became seriously involved in marriage practice), and to be included perhaps among its most arduous triumphs. Dower is an outcome of the ecclesiastical practice of exacting from the husband at marriage a promise to endow his wife, a promise retained in form even now in the marriage ritual of the [[Established Church]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]], ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', II, 134, note p.&lt;/ref&gt; Dower is mentioned in an ordinance of [[King Philip Augustus]] of [[France]] (1214), and in the almost contemporaneous [[Magna Carta]] (1215); but it seems to have already become customary law in [[Normandy]], [[Sicily]], and [[Naples]], as well as in England. The object of both ordinance and charter was to regulate the amount of the dower where this was not the subject of voluntary arrangement, dower by English law consisting of a wife's life estate in one-third of the lands of the husband "of which any issue which she might have had might by possibility have been heir".&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, ''op. cit.'', 131&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and other Common Law Countries===
There is judicial authority of the year 1310 for the proposition that dower was favoured by law,&lt;ref&gt;[[Year Books]] of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], London, 1905, Vol. III, 189&lt;/ref&gt; and at a less remote period it was said to be with life and liberty one of three things which "the law favoreth". In England in the late 18th century, it became common for men to hold land with a trust that prevented their wives' acquiring dower.  Accordingly, the English statute, the [[Fines and Recoveries Act 1833]] was passed to impair the inviolability of dower by empowering husbands to cut off by deed or will their wives from dower. Wives married before the Act still had (in certain cases) to acknowledge the deed before a commissioner to bar their right to dower in property which their husband sold.  This was simpler than the previous procedure, which had required a [[Fine of lands|fine]] to be levied in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], a [[legal fiction|fictitious proceeding]], by which she and her husband formally remitted their right to the property to the purchaser.

In English law, dower was one third of the lands [[seisin|seised]] in fee by the husband during the marriage. However, in the early modern period, it was common for a wife to bar her right to dower in advance under a marriage settlement, under which she agreed to take instead a [[jointure]], that is a particular interest in her husband's property, either a particular share, or a life interest in a particular part of the land, or an annuity.  This was often part of an arrangement by which she gave up her property to her husband in exchange for her jointure, which would accordingly be greater than a third.  Strictly dower was only available from land that her husband owned, but a life tenant under a settlement was often given power to appoint a [[jointure]] for his wife.  The wife would retain her right to dower (if not barred by a settlement) even if her husband sold the property; however this right could also be barred by a fictitious court proceeding known as levying a fine.  The widow of a [[copyhold]]er was usually provided for by the custom of the [[manorialism|manor]] with [[freebench]], an equivalent right to dower, but often (but not necessarily) a half, rather than a third.

===Scotland===
Under [[Scots law]], the part of the estate that cannot be denied to a surviving wife is referred to as [[jus relictae]].

===United States===
It was the law of dower unimpaired by statute, which according to the [[United States|American]] commentator [[Chancellor Kent]] has been "with some modifications everywhere adopted as part of the municipal jurisprudence of the [[United States]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Commentaries on [[Law of the United States|American Law]]'', IV, 36&lt;/ref&gt; However, dower was never received under Louisianan law and has been expressly abolished in most states and territories. Where it still remains, dower has been heavily modified by statute, is no longer automatically applied, and largely superseded by other forms of marital property arrangements ([[elective share]], [[community property]]).

==Relationship to religious profession==
During the pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] period, a man who became a monk and made his religious profession in England was deemed civilly dead, "dead in law" ;&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, ''op. cit.'', Bk. II, 121&lt;/ref&gt; consequently his heirs inherited his land forthwith as though he had died a natural death. Assignment of dower in his hand would nevertheless be postponed until the natural death of such a man, for only by his wife's consent could a married man be legally professed in religion, and she was not allowed by her consent to exchange her husband for dower. After the Reformation and the enactment of the English statute of 11 and 12 [[William III of England|William III]], prohibiting "papists" from inheriting or purchasing lands, a [[Roman Catholic]] widow was not held to be debarred of dower, for dower accruing by operation of law was deemed to be not within the prohibitions of the statute. By a curious disability of old English law a [[Jewish]] widow born in England would be debarred of dower in land which her husband, he having been an Englishman of the same faith and becoming converted after marriage, should purchase, if she herself remained unconverted.

==Modern status==
{{disputed|section|date=October 2016}}
Of dower (''douaire'') as it existed in the old French law no trace is to be found in the existing law of France. But brought to [[Canada]] from the mother country in pre-Revolutionary times, customary dower accruing by operation of law is yet recognized in the law of the former French province of [[Quebec]]. The civil death which by English law seems to have applied to men only, might be by the French law incurred by women taking perpetual religious vows. Therefore, a widow entering into religion would lose her dower, although in some regions she was allowed to retain a moderate income.&lt;ref&gt;See Larousse, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; And now by the law of Quebec a widow joining certain religious orders of the province is deemed civilly dead and undoubtedly would suffer loss of dower.

==Morganatic marriage: a post-medieval application==
Some well-born persons have been prone to marry an ineligible spouse. Particularly in European countries where the equal birth of spouses (''Ebenbürtigkeit'') was an important condition to marriages of dynasts of reigning houses and high nobility, the old matrimonial and contractual law provision of dowering was taken into a new use by institutionalizing the [[morganatic marriage]]. Marriage being morganatical prevents the passage of the husband's titles and privileges to the wife and any children born of the marriage.

''Morganatic'', from the [[Latin]] phrase ''matrimonium ad morganaticam'', refers to the dower (Latin: ''morganaticum'', German: ''Morgengabe'', Swedish: ''morgongåva'' ). When a marriage contract is made that the bride and the children of the marriage will not receive anything else (than the dower) from the bridegroom or from his inheritance or patrimony or from his clan, that sort of marriage was dubbed as "marriage with only the dower and no other inheritance", i.e. ''matrimonium ad morganaticum''.

Neither the bride nor any children of the marriage has any right on the groom's titles, rights, or entailed property. The children are considered legitimate on other counts and the prohibition of [[polygamy|bigamy]] applies.

The practice of "only-doweried" is close to [[pre-nuptial contract]]s excluding the spouse from property, though children are usually not affected by prenuptials, whereas they certainly were by morganatical marriage.

Morganatic marriage contained an agreement that the wife and the children born of the marriage will not receive anything further than what was agreed in pre-nuptials, and in some cases may have been zero, or something nominal. Separate nobility titles were given to morganatic wives of dynasts of reigning houses, but it sometimes included no true property. This sort of dower was far from the original purpose of the bride receiving a settled property from the bridegroom's clan, in order to ensure her livelihood in widowhood.

The practice of morganatic marriage was most common in historical [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states]], where equality of birth between the spouses was considered an important principle among the reigning houses and high nobility. Morganatic marriage has not been and is not possible in jurisdictions that do not allow sufficient freedom of contracting, as it is an agreement containing that pre-emptive limitation to the inheritance and property rights of the wife and the children. Marriages have never been considered morganatic in any part of the [[United Kingdom]].

==In Islam==
{{main|Mahr}}
The payment from the groom to the bride is a mandatory condition for all valid [[Nikah|Muslim marriages]]: a man must pay mahr (donatio propter nuptias in Latin) to his bride. It is the duty of the husband to pay as stated in the Qu'ran (Sura Al-Nisaa’ verses 4 and 20–24), although often his family may assist, and by agreement can be in promissory form, i.e. in the event the husband pronounces [[Divorce (Islamic)|talaq]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamswomen.com/marriage/fiqh_of_marriage_6.php|title=Islams Women - Fiqh of Marriage - Dowry|publisher=islamswomen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a gift which the bride has to agree on. The mahr can be any value as long as it is agreed upon by both parties. When the groom gives his bride the mahr, it becomes her property.

If the mahr was in promissory form then upon [[Islamic divorce|divorce]], the mahr becomes payable if the husband initiated the divorce ([[Divorce (Islamic)|talaq]]). If it was previously paid a woman is entitled to keep her mahr. However, if the woman initiates the divorce (in the procedure called [[khula]]), the circumstances of the breakup become relevant. If the divorce is sought for cause; meaning, in an Islamic context, her husband's abuse, illness, impotence, or infidelity, the woman is generally considered to have the right to keep the mahr; however, if the divorce is not sought for a generally accepted cause, the husband may request its return.

The amount promised or paid to the bride forms part of her personal property and is of assistance to her in times of financial need, such as a divorce or desertion by the husband. While the mahr is usually in the form of cash, it may also be a house or viable business that is put in her name and can be run and owned entirely by her if she so chooses.

==In the Bahá'í Faith==
According to the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]]'s most holy book, the dower is paid from the groom to the bride. The dower, if the husband lives in a city, is nineteen [http://bahai-library.com/writings/bahaullah/aqdas/glossary.html#Mithqal mithqáls] (approx. 2.2 [[troy ounce]]s) of pure gold, or, if the husband lives outside a city, the same amount in silver.

'''European competition law''' is the [[competition law]] in use within the European Union. It promotes the maintenance of competition within the  [[European Single Market]] by regulating anti-competitive conduct by companies to ensure that they do not create [[cartels]] and [[monopolies]] that would damage the interests of society. 

European competition law today derives mostly from articles [[Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|101]] to 109 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (TFEU), as well as a series of Regulations and Directives. Four main policy areas include:

*[[Cartel]]s, or control of [[collusion]] and other [[anti-competitive practices]], under article 101 TFEU.
*[[Monopoly|Market dominance]], or preventing the abuse of firms' [[Dominant market position|dominant market positions]] under article 102 TFEU.
*[[Mergers and acquisitions|Mergers]], control of proposed mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures involving companies that have a certain, defined amount of turnover in the EU, according to the [[European Union merger law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0139:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 32004R0139 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[State aid]], control of direct and indirect aid given by [[Member state of the European Union|Member States of the European Union]] to companies under [[TFEU]] article 107.

Primary authority for applying competition law within the [[European Union]] rests with [[European Commission]] and its Directorate General for Competition, although state aids in some sectors, such as agriculture, are handled by other Directorates General. The Directorates can mandate that improperly-given state aid be repaid, as was the case in 2012 with [[Malev Hungarian Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-01-09/hungary-s-malev-airline-ordered-by-eu-to-repay-state-support.html|title=Terms of Service Violation|website=www.businessweek.com|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading [[European Court of Justice|ECJ]] cases on competition law include ''[[Consten SaRL and Grundig GmbH v Commission|Consten &amp; Grundig v Commission]]'' and ''[[United Brands Company v Commission of the European Communities|United Brands v Commission]]''.

==History==
{{See also|History of competition law}}
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=right|quote="people of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary."|source=[[A Smith]], ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations/Book_I/Chapter_10 Book I, ch 10]}}
One of the paramount aims of the founding fathers of the European Community - statesmen around [[Jean Monnet]] and [[Robert Schuman]] - was the establishment of a Single Market. To achieve this, a compatible, transparent and fairly standardised regulatory framework for Competition Law had to be created. The constitutive legislative act was Council Regulation 17/62&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31962R0017:EN:NOT |title=EEC Council: Regulation No 17: First Regulation implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now superseded). The wording of Reg 17/62 was developed in a pre ''Van Gend en Loos'' period in EC legal evolution, when the supremacy of EC law was not yet fully established. To avoid different interpretations of EC Competition Law, which could vary from one national court to the next, the Commission was made to assume the role of central enforcement authority.

The first major decision under Article 101 (then Article 85) was taken by the Commission in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31964D0566:EN:NOT 64/566/CEE: Décision de la Commission, du 23 septembre 1964, relative à une procédure au titre de l'article 85 du traité (IV-A/00004-03344 «Grundig-Consten»)] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that [[Grundig]], a German manufacturer of household appliances, acted illegally in granting exclusive dealership rights to its French subsidiary. In ''Consten &amp; Grundig'' [1966] the [[European Court of Justice]] upheld the Commission's decision, expanded the definition of measures affecting trade to include "potential effects" {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}, and generally anchored its key position in Competition Law enforcement alongside the Commission. Subsequent enforcement of Art 101 of the TFEU Treaty (combating anti-competitive business agreements) by the two institutions has generally been regarded as effective. Yet some analysts assert that the Commission's [[monopoly]] policy (the enforcement of Art 102) has been "largely ineffective",&lt;ref&gt;See, Cini &amp; McGowan&lt;/ref&gt; because of the resistance of individual Member State governments that sought to shield their most salient national companies from legal challenges. The Commission also received criticism from the academic quarters. For instance, Valentine Korah, an eminent legal analyst in the field, argued that the Commission was too strict in its application of EC Competition rules and often ignored the dynamics of [[Corporate behaviour|company behaviour]], which, in her opinion, could actually be beneficial to consumers and to the quality of available goods in some cases.

Nonetheless, the arrangements in place worked fairly well until the mid-1980s, when it became clear that with the passage of time, as the European economy steadily grew in size and anti-competitive activities and market practices became more complex in nature, the Commission would eventually be unable to deal with its workload.&lt;ref&gt;See Gerber &amp; Cassinis&lt;/ref&gt; The central dominance of the [[Directorate-General for Competition (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Competition]] has been challenged by the rapid growth and sophistication of the National Competition Authorities (NCAs) and by increased criticism from the European courts with respect to procedure, interpretation and economic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;See Wallace &amp; Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; These problems have been magnified by the increasingly unmanageable workload of the centralised corporate notification system. A further reason why a reform of the old Regulation 17/62 was needed, was the looming enlargement of the EU, by which its membership was to expand to [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|25 by 2004]] and [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|27 by 2007]]. Given the still developing nature of the [[Transition economy|east-central European new market economies]], the already inundated Commission anticipated a further significant increase in its workload.

To all these challenges, the Commission has responded with a strategy to decentralise the implementation of the Competition rules through the so-called [[Modernisation Regulation]]. EU Council Regulation 1/2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R0001:EN:NOT |title=Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; places National Competition Authorities and Member State national courts at the heart of the enforcement of Arts 101 &amp; 102. Decentralised enforcement has for long been the usual way for other EC rules, Reg 1/2003 finally extended this to Competition Law as well. The Commission still retained an important role in the enforcement mechanism, as the co-ordinating force in the newly created [[European Competition Network]] (ECN). This Network, made up of the national bodies plus the Commission, manages the flow of information between NCAs and maintains the coherence and integrity of the system. At the time, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti hailed this regulation as one that will 'revolutionise' the enforcement of Arts 101 &amp; 102. Since May 2004, all NCAs and national courts are empowered to fully apply the Competition provisions of the EC Treaty. In its 2005 report, the [[OECD]] lauded the modernisation effort as promising, and noted that decentralisation helps to redirect resources so the DG Competition can concentrate on complex, Community-wide investigations. Yet most recent developments shed doubt on the efficacy of the new arrangements. For instance, on 20 December 2006, the Commission publicly backed down from 'unbundling' French (EdF) and German ([[E.ON]]) energy giants, facing tough opposition from Member State governments. Another legal battle is currently ongoing over the E.ON-Endesa merger, where the Commission has been trying to enforce the free movement of capital, while Spain firmly protects its perceived national interests. It remains to be seen whether NCAs will be willing to challenge their own national 'champion companies' under EC Competition Law, or whether patriotic feelings prevail.

==Mergers and monopolisation==
{{main article|TFEU article 102}}

===Scope of competition law===

Because the logic of competition is most appropriate for private enterprise, the core of EU competition regulation targets profit making corporations. This said, regulation necessarily extends further and in the [[TFEU]], both articles 101 and 102 use the ambiguous concept of "undertaking" to delimit competition law's reach. This uncomfortable English word, which is essentially a literal translation of the German word "Unternehmen", was discussed in ''[[Höfner and Elser v Macrotron GmbH]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1991] ECR I-1979 ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61990J0041:EN:NOT C-41/90])&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Court of Justice]] described "undertaking" to mean any person (natural or legal) "engaged in an economic activity", which potentially included state run enterprises in cases where they pursued economic activities like a private business. This included a state run employment agency, where it attempted to make money but was not in a position to meet demand. By contrast, in ''[[FENIN v Commission]]'', public services which were run on the basis of "solidarity" for a "social purpose" were said to be outside the scope of competition law.&lt;ref&gt;[2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Self-employed people, who are in business on their own account, will be classed as undertakings, but employees are wholly excluded. Following the same principle that was laid down by the US [[Clayton Act 1914]], they are by their "very nature the opposite of the independent exercise of an economic or commercial activity".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Albany International BV]]'' (1999) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996C0067:EN:NOT], per AG Jacobs&lt;/ref&gt; This means that trade unions cannot be regarded as subject to competition law, because their central objective is to remedy the [[inequality of bargaining power]] that exists in dealing with employers who are generally organised in a corporate form.

===Mergers and acquisitions===
{{Clist mergers}}
{{main article|European Union merger law}}
Under the authority of Article 102 TFEU, the European Commission became able not only to regulate the behaviour of large firms it claims abuse their dominant positions or [[market power]], but also the possibility of firms gaining the position within the [[market structure]] that enables them to behave abusively in the first place. The [[Merger Regulation]] (EC) No 139/2004 deals with mergers that have a "Community dimension" and lays out a procedure whereby all "concentrations" (i.e. mergers, acquisitions, takeovers) between undertakings are subject to approval by the European Commission.

A merger or acquisition involves, from a competition law perspective, the concentration of economic power in the hands of fewer than before. In the European Union, under the Merger Regulation 139/2004. This is known as the "ECMR", and the authority for the Commission to pass this regulation is found under Art. 103 TFEU. Competition law requires that firms proposing to merge gain authorisation from the relevant government authority, or simply go ahead but face the prospect of [[demerger]] should the concentration later be found to lessen competition.

The central provision under EU law asks whether a concentration ''would'' if it went ahead "significantly impede effective competition... in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position..."&lt;ref&gt;Art. 2(3) Reg. 129/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Under article 3(1), a concentration means a "change of control on a lasting basis results from (a) the merger of two or more previously independent undertakings... (b) the acquisition... if direct or indirect control of the whole or parts of one or more other undertakings."&lt;ref&gt;[[Merger Regulation]] (EC) No 139/2004, art 3(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

This usually means that one firm buys out the [[share (finance)|share]]s of another. The reasons for oversight of economic concentrations by the state are the same as the reasons to restrict firms who abuse a position of dominance, only that regulation of mergers and acquisitions attempts to deal with the problem before it arises, ''ex ante'' prevention of creating dominant firms. In the case of ''[[Gencor Ltd v Commission]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1999) T-102/96, [1999] ECR II-753&lt;/ref&gt; the EU [[Court of First Instance]] wrote merger control is there "...to avoid the establishment of market structures which may create or strengthen a dominant position and not need to control directly possible abuses of dominant positions."

What amounts to a substantial lessening of, or significant impediment to competition is usually answered through empirical study. The market shares of the merging companies can be assessed and added, although this kind of analysis only gives rise to presumptions, not conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;see, for instance para 17, ''Guidelines on the assessment of horizontal mergers'' (2004/C 31/03)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Herfindahl index|Herfindahl-Hirschman Index]] is used to calculate the "density" of the market, or what concentration exists. Aside from the maths, it is important to consider the product in question and the rate of technical innovation in the market.&lt;ref&gt;''[[France v Commission]]'' (1998) C-68/94, [1998] ECR I-1375, para. 219&lt;/ref&gt; A further problem of collective dominance, or [[oligopoly]] through "economic links"&lt;ref&gt;''Italian Flat Glass'' [1992] ECR ii-1403&lt;/ref&gt; can arise, whereby the new market becomes more conducive to [[collusion]]. It is relevant how transparent a market is, because a more concentrated structure could mean firms can co-ordinate their behaviour more easily, whether firms can deploy deterrents and whether firms are safe from a reaction by their competitors and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Airtours plc v Commission]]'' (2002) T-342/99, [2002] ECR II-2585, para 62&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of new firms to the market, and any barriers that they might encounter should be considered.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mannesmann, Vallourec and Ilva]]'' [1994] CMLR 529, OJ L102 21 April 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain exceptions exist, by which a firm whose conduct may be ''prima facie'' anti-competitive can be sanctioned under the reference to "technical and economic progress" in Art. 2 of the ECMR.&lt;ref&gt;see the argument put forth in Hovenkamp H (1999) ''Federal Antitrust Policy: The Law of Competition and Its Practice'', 2nd Ed, West Group, St. Paul, Minnesota. Unlike the authorities however, the courts take a dim view of the efficiencies defence.&lt;/ref&gt; Another defence might be that a firm being taken over is about to fail or go insolvent, and taking it over does not diminish the competitive state any more than what would happen anyway.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kali und Salz AG v Commission]]'' [1975] ECR 499&lt;/ref&gt; Mergers vertically in the market are rarely of concern, although in ''AOL/Time Warner''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time Warner/AOL]]'' [2002] 4 CMLR 454, OJ L268&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Commission]] required that a joint venture with a competitor [[Bertelsmann]] be ceased beforehand. The EU authorities have also focussed lately on the effect of [[conglomerate merger]]s, where companies acquire a large portfolio of related products, though without necessarily dominant shares in any individual market.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Guinness/Grand Metropolitan]]'' [1997] 5 CMLR 760, OJ L288; Many in the US are scathing of this approach, see W. J. Kolasky, ‘Conglomerate Mergers and Range Effects: It's a long way from Chicago to Brussels’ 9 November 2001, Address before George Mason University Symposium Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse of dominance===
{{Clist dominance}}
Article 102 is aimed at preventing undertakings that have a dominant market position from abusing that position to the detriment of consumers. It provides that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the common market or in a substantial part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market insofar as it may affect trade between Member States.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This can mean,
&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions; 
(b) limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers;

(c) applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage; 
(d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The provision aims to protect competition and promote consumer welfare by preventing firms from abusing dominant market positions. This objective has been emphasised by EU institutions and officials on numerous occasions – for example, it was stated as such during the judgement in ''Deutsche Telekom v Commission'',&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Case C-280/08 P Deutsche Telekom v Commission [2010] ECR I-9555&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the former Commissioner for Competition, Neelie Kroes, also specified in 2005 that: “First, it is competition, and not competitors, that is to be protected. Second, ultimately the aim is to avoid consumer harm”.&lt;ref&gt;SPEECH/05/537, 23 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the European Commission published its ''Guidance on Article [102] Enforcement Priorities'', &lt;ref&gt; Guidance on the Commission’s enforcement priorities in applying Article 82 TFEU to abusive exclusionary conduct by dominant undertakings OJ [2009] C 45/7&lt;/ref&gt; which details the body's aims when applying Article 102, reiterating that the ultimate goal is the protection of the competitive process and the concomitant consumer benefits that are derived from it.&lt;ref&gt; Ibid. paras. [5-6]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding these stated objectives, Article 102 is quite controversial and has been much scrutinised.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber, David J., The Future of Article 82: Dissecting the Conflict (August 2007). European Competition Law Annual 2007: A Reformed Approach to Article 82 EC (Claus-Dieter Ehlermann and Mel Marquis eds.), 2008; Chicago-Kent College of Law Research Paper. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2159343&lt;/ref&gt; In large part, this stems from the fact that the provision applies only where dominance is present; meaning a firm that is not in a dominant market position could legitimately pursue competitive practices – such as bundling – that would otherwise constitute abuse if committed by a dominant firm. That is not to suggest that it is unlawful for a firm to hold a dominant position; rather, it is the ''abuse'' of that position that is the concern of Article 102 – as was stated in ''Michelin v Commission''&lt;ref&gt;Case 322/81 Michelin v Commission [1983] ECR 3461&lt;/ref&gt; a dominant firm has a: “special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair undistorted competition”.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, para. [57]&lt;/ref&gt;

In applying Article 102, the Commission must consider two points. Firstly, it is necessary to show that an undertaking holds a dominant position in the relevant market and, secondly, there must be an analysis of the undertaking's behaviour to ascertain whether it is abusive. Determining dominance is often a question of whether a firm behaves "to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors, customers and ultimately of its consumer."&lt;ref&gt;''[[United Brands Company v Commission of the European Communities|United Brands v Commission]]'' (1978) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61976J0027:EN:NOT C-27/76], [1978] ECR 207&lt;/ref&gt; Under EU law, very large market shares raise a presumption that a firm is dominant,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co AG v Commission]]''(1979) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61976J0085:EN:NOT C-85/76], [1979] ECR 461&lt;/ref&gt; which may be rebuttable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[AKZO]]'' (1991) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61986J0062:EN:NOT ]&lt;/ref&gt; If a firm has a dominant position, because it has beyond a 39.7% market share&lt;ref&gt;This was the lowest yet market share of a "dominant" firm, in ''[[BA/Virgin]]'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt; then there is "a special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair competition on the common market"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Michelin]]'' [1983]&lt;/ref&gt; Same as with collusive conduct, market shares are determined with reference to the particular market in which the firm and product in question is sold.

With regard to abuse, it is possible to identify three different forms that the EU Commission and Courts have recognised.&lt;ref&gt; Whish, R. and Bailey, D. (2015). Competition law. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 212-213&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, there are ''exploitative'' abuses, whereby a dominant firm abuses its market position to exploit consumers – for example by reducing output and increasing the price of its goods or services.&lt;ref&gt;Gal, Michal S., Abuse of Dominance - Exploitative Abuses (March 10, 2015). in HANDBOOK ON EUROPEAN COMPETITION LAW (Lianos and Geradin eds., Edward Elgar, 2013), Chapter 9, pp. 385-422 . Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2576042&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, there are ''exclusionary'' abuses, involving behaviour by a dominant firm which is aimed at, or has the effect of, preventing the development of competition by excluding competitors.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Alison and Lovdahl Gormsen, Liza, Abuse of Dominance: Exclusionary Pricing Abuses (January 1, 2013). I Lianos and D Geradin, Handbook on European Competition Law: Substantive Aspects (Edward Elgar, 2013). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2395165&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, there exists a possible third category of ''single market'' abuse, which concerns behaviour that is harmful to the principles of the single market more broadly, such as the impeding of parallel imports or limiting of intra-brand competition.&lt;ref&gt;Case 226/84 British Leyland v Commission [1986] ECR 3263&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is no rigid demarcation between these three types, Article 102 has most frequently been applied to forms of conduct falling under the heading of exclusionary abuse. Generally, this is because exploitative abuses are perceived to be less invidious than exclusionary abuses because the former can easily be remedied by competitors provided there are no barriers to market entry, whilst the latter require more authoritative intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Lang. J – ‘How Can the Problems of Exclusionary Abuses under Article 102 TFEU be Resolved?’ [2012] 37 E.L. Rev. 136-155&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the Commission's ''Guidance'' explicitly recognises the distinction between the different types of abusive conduct and states that the Guidance is limited to examples of exclusionary abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Guidance para. [7]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, much of the jurisprudence of Article 102 concerns behaviour which can be categorised as exclusionary.

The Article does not contain an explicit definition of what amounts to abusive conduct and the courts have made clear that the types of abusive conduct in which a dominant firm may engage is not closed.&lt;ref&gt;Case 6/72 Continental Can v Commission [1973] ECR 215&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible to discern a general meaning of the term from the jurisprudence of the EU courts. In ''Hoffman-La Roche'',&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Case 85/76 Hoffman-La Roche v Commission [1979] ECR 461&lt;/ref&gt; it was specified that dominant firms must refrain from ‘methods different from those which condition normal competition’.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid. at para [91]&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of ‘normal’ competition has developed into the idea of ‘competition on the merits’,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; which states that competitive practices leading to the marginalisation of inefficient competitors will be permissible so long as it is within the realm of normal, or on the merit, competitive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Case C-209/10 Post Danmark EU:C: 2012:172, at para. [22]&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission provides examples of normal, positive, competitive behaviour as offering lower prices, better quality products and a wider choice of new and improved goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Guidance para. [5]&lt;/ref&gt; From this, it can be inferred that behaviour that is abnormal – or not ‘on the merits’ – and therefore amounting to abuse, includes such infractions as margin squeezing, refusals to supply and the misleading of patent authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, D. and Whish, R. (2015). Competition law (8th Edition). Oxford University Press, pp. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of the types of conduct held by the EU Courts to constitute abuse include:
* Exclusive dealing agreements&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
Whereby a customer is required to purchase all or most of a particular type of good or service from a dominant supplier and is prevented from buying from others.
* Granting of exclusivity rebates&lt;ref&gt;Case T-286/09 Intel v Commission EU:T:2014:547&lt;/ref&gt;
Purported loyalty schemes that are equivalent in effect to exclusive dealing agreements.
* Tying&lt;ref&gt;Case T-201/04 Microsoft Corpn v Commission [2007] ECR II-3601&lt;/ref&gt;
Tying one product to the sale of another, thereby restricting consumer choice.
* Bundling&lt;ref&gt;De Poste-La Poste OJ [2002] L 61/32&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar to tying, whereby a supplier will only supply its products in a bundle with one or more other products.
* Margin squeezing&lt;ref&gt; Case C-280/08 P Deutsche Telekom v Commission [2010] ECR I-9555&lt;/ref&gt;
Vertical practices that have the effect of excluding downstream competitors.
* Refusing to license intellectual property rights&lt;ref&gt; Case 24/67 Parke, Davis &amp; Co v Probel [1968] ECR 55&lt;/ref&gt;
Whereby a dominant firm holding patented rights refuses to licence those rights to others.
* Refusal to supply&lt;ref&gt; Case 6/73 Commercial Solvents v Commission [1974] ECR 223&lt;/ref&gt;
Refusing to supply a competitor with a good or service, often in a bid to drive them out of the market.
* Predatory pricing&lt;ref&gt; Case T-340/03 France Telecom SA v Commission (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
Where a dominant firm deliberately reduces prices to loss-making levels in order to force competitors out of the market. 
* Price discrimination&lt;ref&gt; Case T-288/97 Irish Sugar plc v Commission [1999]&lt;/ref&gt;
Arbitrarily charging some market participants higher prices that are unconnected to the actual costs of supplying the goods or services.

Whilst there are no statutory defences under Article 102, the Court of Justice has stressed that a dominant firm may seek to justify behaviour that would otherwise constitute abuse, either by arguing that the behaviour is objectively justifiable or by showing that any resulting negative consequences are outweighed by the greater efficiencies it promotes.&lt;ref&gt;Case C-209/10 Post Danmark v Commission EU:C:2012:172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friederiszick, Hans Wolfgang and Gratz, Linda, Dominant and Efficient – On the Relevance of Efficiencies in Abuse of Dominance Cases (December 19, 2012). ESMT White Paper No. WP-12-01. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2191492 pp.23-30&lt;/ref&gt;
In order for behaviour to be objectively justifiable, the conduct in question must be proportionate&lt;ref&gt;Loewenthal ‘The Defence of “Objective Justification” in the Application of Article 82 EC’ (2005) 28 World Competition 455&lt;/ref&gt; and would have to be based on factors external to the dominant undertaking's control&lt;ref&gt;Guidance, para [29]&lt;/ref&gt; – such as health or safety considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Case T-30/89 Hilti AG v Commission [1991] ECR II-1439&lt;/ref&gt; To substantiate a claim on efficiency grounds, the Commission's ''Guidance'' states that four cumulative conditions must be satisfied:&lt;ref&gt;Guidance, para [30]&lt;/ref&gt;
# The efficiencies would have to be realised, or be likely to be realised, as a result of the conduct;
# The conduct would have to be indispensable to the realisation of those efficiencies;
# The efficiencies would have to outweigh any negative effects on competition and consumer welfare; And
# The conduct must not eliminate all effective competition.
If an abuse of dominance is established, the Commission has the power, pursuant to Article 23 of Regulation 1/2003,&lt;ref&gt;OJ [2003] L 1/1&lt;/ref&gt; to impose a fine and to order the dominant undertaking to cease and desist from the unlawful conduct in question. Additionally, though yet to be imposed, Article 7 of Regulation 1/2003&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; permits the Commission, where proportionate and necessary, to order the divestiture of an undertaking's assets.

==Cartels and collusion==
{{main article|TFEU article 101}}
Possibly the least contentious function of competition law is to control [[cartels]] among private businesses. Any "undertaking" is regulated, and this concept embraces ''de facto'' economic units, or enterprises, regardless of whether they are a single corporation, or a group of multiple companies linked through ownership or contract.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Viho BV v Commission]]'' (1995) Case C-73/95, [1995] ECR I-5457&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cartels===
{{Clist collusion}}
{{see also|Cartel|Sherman Act 1890}}
To violate [[TFEU]] article 101, undertakings must then have formed an agreement, developed a "concerted practice", or, within an association, taken a decision. Like [[US antitrust]], this just means all the same thing;&lt;ref&gt;''Van Landewyck'' (1980) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61978C0209:EN:NOT], per AG Reischl, there is no need to distinguish an agreement from a concerted practice, because they are merely convenient labels&lt;/ref&gt; any kind of dealing or contact, or a "meeting of the minds" between parties. Covered therefore is a whole range of behaviour from a strong handshaken, written or verbal agreement to a supplier sending invoices with directions not to export to its retailer who gives "tacit acquiescence" to the conduct.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sandoz Prodotti Farmaceutica SpA v Commission]]'' (1990) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61987J0277:EN:NOT]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 101(1) prohibits,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between member states and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This includes both horizontal (e.g. between retailers) and vertical (e.g. between retailers and suppliers) agreements, effectively outlawing the operation of [[cartels]] within the EU. Article 101 has been construed very widely to include both informal agreements (gentlemen's agreements) and concerted practices where firms tend to raise or lower prices at the same time without having physically agreed to do so. However, a coincidental increase in prices will not in itself prove a concerted practice, there must also be evidence that the parties involved were aware that their behaviour may prejudice the normal operation of the competition within the common market. This latter subjective requirement of knowledge is not, in principle, necessary in respect of agreements. As far as agreements are concerned the mere anticompetitive effect is sufficient to make it illegal even if the parties were unaware of it or did not intend such effect to take place.

===Exemptions===
Exemptions to Article 101 behaviour fall into three categories. Firstly, Article 101(3) creates an exemption for practices beneficial to consumers, e.g., by facilitating technological advances, but without restricting all competition in the area. In practice the Commission gave very few official exemptions and a new system for dealing with them is currently under review. Secondly, the Commission agreed to exempt 'Agreements of minor importance' (except those fixing sale prices) from Article 101. This exemption applies to small companies, together holding no more than 10% of the relevant market. In this situation as with Article 102 (see below), market definition is a crucial, but often highly difficult, matter to resolve. Thirdly, the Commission has also introduced a collection of block exemptions for different contract types. These include a list of contract permitted terms and a list of banned terms in these exemptions.

===European enforcement===
{{see also|European Commission|Enforcement of European competition law}}
The task of tracking down and punishing those in breach of competition law has been entrusted to the European Commission, which receives its powers under Article 105 TFEU. Under this Article, the European Commission is charged with the duty of ensuring the application of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU and of investigating suspected infringements of these Articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paul Craig and Gráinne de Burca|title=EU LAW, Tect, Cases and Materials|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1064}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission and national competition authorities have wide on-site investigation powers. Article 105 TFEU grants extensive investigative powers including the notorious power to carry out dawn raids on the premises of suspected undertakings and private homes and vehicles.

There are many ways in which the European Commission could become aware of a potential violation: 
The European Commission may carry out investigation or inspections, for which it is empowered to request information from governments, competent authorities of Member States, and undertakings. The Commission also provides a ''leniency policy'', under which companies that whistle blow over the anti-competition policies of cartels are treated leniently and may obtain either total immunity or a reduction in fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/cartels/leniency/leniency.html|title=About the cartel leniency policy - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases, parties have sought to resist the taking of certain documents during an inspection based on the argument that those documents are covered by legal professional privilege between lawyer and client. The ECJ held that such a privilege was recognised by EC law to a limited extent at least.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=''[[Australian Mining and Smelting Europe Ltd v Commission]]'', ECR 1575|year=1982|volume=Case 155/79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Commission also could become aware of a potential competition violation through the complaint from an aggrieved party. In addition, Member States and any natural or legal person are entitled to make a complaint if they have a legitimate interest.

Article 101 (2) TFEU considers any undertaking found in breach of Article 101 TFEU to be null and void and that agreements cannot be legally enforced. In addition, the European Commission may impose a fine pursuant to Article 23 of Regulation 1/2003. These fines are not fixed and can extend into millions of Euros, up to a maximum of 10% of the total worldwide turnover of each of the undertakings participating in the infringement, although there may be a decrease in case of cooperation and increase in case of recidivism. Fines of up to 5% of the average daily turnover may also be levied for every day an undertaking fails to comply with Commission requirements. The gravity and duration of the infringement are to be taken into account in determining the amount of the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paul Craig and Gráinne de Burca|title=EU LAW, Text, Cases and Materials|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1074}}&lt;/ref&gt; This uncertainty acts as a powerful deterrent and ensures that companies are unable to undertake a cost/benefit analysis before breaching competition law.&lt;br /&gt;
 
The Commission guideline on the method of setting fines imposed pursuant to Article 23 (2) (a) of Regulation 1/2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines on the method of setting fines imposed pursuant to Article 23(2)(a) of Regulation No 1/2003|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2006:210:0002:0005:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  uses a two-step methodology:

* The Commission first defines a basic amount of the fine for each involved undertaking or association of undertakings; and then
* Adjusts the basic amount according to the individual circumstances upwards or downwards.

The basic amount relates, inter alia, to the proportion of the value of the sales depending on the degree of the gravity of the infringement. In this regard, Article 5 of the aforementioned guideline states, that
:"To achieve these objectives, it is appropriate for the Commission to refer to the value of the sales of goods or services to which the infringement relates as a basis for setting the fine. The duration of the infringement should also play a significant role in the setting of the fine. It necessarily affects the potential consequences of the infringements on the market. It is therefore considered important that the fine should also reflect the number of years during which an undertaking participated in the infringement."

In a second step, this basic amount may be adjusted on grounds of recidivism or leniency. In the latter case, immunity from fines may be granted to the company who submits evidence first to the European Commission which enables it to carry out an investigation and/or to find an infringement of Article 101 TFEU.

The highest cartel fine which was ever imposed was related to a cartel consisting of four car glass producers. The companies Asahi, Pilkington, Saint-Gobain and Soliver were fined over €1.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illegal car glass cartel receives record fines |url=http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/press/frontpage/12a112008_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1998 and early 2003 those companies had discussed target prices, market sharing and customer allocation in a series of meetings and other illicit contacts. In this case, the European Commission started its investigation based on an anonymous "tip".

Another negative consequence for the companies involved in cartel cases may be the adverse publicity which may damage the company's reputation.

Questions of reform have circulated around whether to introduce US style treble damages as added deterrent against competition law violaters. The recent Modernisation Regulation 1/2003 has meant that the European Commission no longer has a monopoly on enforcement, and that private parties may bring suits in national courts. Hence, there has been debate over the legitimacy of private damages actions in traditions that shy from imposing punitive measures in civil actions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

According to the Court of Justice of the European Union, any citizen or business who suffers harm as a result of a breach of the European Union competition rules (Articles 101 and 102 TFEU) should be able to obtain reparation from the party who caused the harm. However, despite this requirement under European law to establish an effective legal framework enabling victims to exercise their right to compensation, victims of European Union competition law infringements to date very often do not obtain reparation for the harm suffered. The amount of compensation that these victims are foregoing is in the range of several billion Euros a year. Therefore, the European Commission has taken a number steps since 2004 to stimulate the debate on that topic and elicit feedback from stakeholders on a number of possible options which could facilitate antitrust damages actions. Based on the outcomes of several public consultations, the Commission has suggested specific policy choices and measures in a White Paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actions for damages|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/actionsdamages/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the European Parliament and European Council issued a joint directive on 'certain rules governing actions for damages under national law for infringements of the competition law provisions of the Members States and of the European Union'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Antitrust Damages Directive 2014/104/EU|url=https://www.carteldamageclaims.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/EU-Damages-Directive-2014_104_EU.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

;Sector inquiry
A special instrument of the European Commission is the so-called sector inquiry in accordance with Art. 17 of Regulation 1/2003.&lt;br /&gt;
 
Article 17 (1) first paragraph of Council Regulation 1/2003 reads:
:"Where the trend of trade between Member States, the rigidity of prices or other circumstances suggest that competition may be restricted or distorted within the common market, the Commission may conduct its inquiry into a particular sector of the economy or into a particular type of agreements across various sectors. In the course of that inquiry, the Commission may request the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned to supply information necessary for giving effect to Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty (now Art. 101 and 102 TFEU) and may carry out any inspections necessary for that purpose."

In case of sector inquiries, the European Commission follows its reasonable suspicion that the competition in a particular industry sector or solely related to a certain type of contract which is used in various industry sectors is prevented, restricted or distorted within the common market. Thus, in this case not a specific violation is investigated. Nevertheless, the European Commission has almost all avenues of investigation at its disposal, which it may use to investigate and track down violations of competition law. The European Commission may decide to start a sector inquiry when a market does not seem to be working as well as it should. This might be suggested by evidence such as limited trade between Member States, lack of new entrants on the market, the rigidity of prices, or other circumstances suggest that competition may be restricted or distorted within the common market. In the course of the inquiry, the Commission may request that firms - undertakings or associations of undertakings - concerned supply information (for example, price information). This information is used by the European Commission to assess whether it needs to open specific investigations into intervene to ensure the respect of EU rules on restrictive agreements and abuse of dominant position (Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).

There has been an increased use of this tool in the recent years, as it is not possible any more for companies to register a cartel or agreement which might be in breach of competition law with the European Commission, but the companies are responsible themselves for assessing whether their agreements constitute a violation of European Union Competition Law (self assessment).

Traditionally, agreements had, subject to certain exceptions, to be notified to the European Commission, and the Commission had a monopoly over the application of Article 101 TFEU (former Article 81 (3) EG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paul Craig and Gráinne de Burca|title=EU LAW, Text, Cases and Materials|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the European Commission did not have the resources to deal with all the agreements notified, notification was abolished.&lt;br /&gt;
 
One of the most spectacular sector inquiry was the pharmaceutical sector inquiry which took place in 2008 and 2009 in which the European Commission used dawn raids from the beginning. The European Commission launched a sector inquiry into EU pharmaceuticals markets under the European Competition rules because information relating to innovative and generic medicines suggested that competition may be restricted or distorted. The inquiry related to the period 2000 to 2007 and involved investigation of a sample of 219 medicines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry Preliminary Report (DG Competition Staff Working Paper) |url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/pharmaceuticals/inquiry/preliminary_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taking into account that sector inquiries are a tool under European Competition law, the inquiry's main focus was company behaviour. The inquiry therefore concentrated on those practices which companies may use to block or delay generic competition as well as to block or delay the development of competing originator drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Communication from the Commission - Executive Summary of the Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry Report |url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/pharmaceuticals/inquiry/communication_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following sectors have also been subject of a sector inquiry:

* Financial Services
* Energy
* Local Loop
* Leased Lines
* Roaming
* Media

;Leniency policy
The leniency policy&lt;ref&gt;see DGCOMP's page on [http://ec.europa.eu/competition/cartels/legislation/leniency_legislation.html Leniency legislation (immunity from fines and reduction of fines in cartel cases)]&lt;/ref&gt; consists in abstaining from prosecuting firms that, being party to a cartel, inform the [[European Commission|Commission]] of its existence. The leniency policy was first applied in 2002.

The ''Commission Notice on Immunity from fines and reduction of fines in cartel cases''&lt;ref&gt;see, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52006XC1208(04):EN:NOT Commission Notice on Immunity from fines and reduction of fines in cartel cases]&lt;/ref&gt; guarantees [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]] and penalty reductions to firms who co-operate with the Commission in detecting cartels.

&lt;blockquote&gt;II.A, §8:&lt;br/&gt;The Commission will ''grant immunity'' from any fine which would otherwise have been imposed to an ''undertaking disclosing its participation in an alleged cartel'' affecting the Community if that undertaking is the '''first to submit information''' and evidence which in the Commission's view will enable it to:&lt;br/&gt;
(a) carry out a targeted inspection in connection with the alleged cartel; or&lt;br/&gt;
(b) find an infringement of Article 81 EC in connection with the alleged cartel.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The mechanism is straightforward. The first firm to acknowledge their crime and inform the Commission will receive complete immunity, that is, no fine will be applied. Co-operation with the Commission will also be gratified with reductions in the fines, in the following way:&lt;ref&gt;see, DGCOMP's [http://ec.europa.eu/competition/cartels/leniency/leniency.html European Commission &gt; Competition &gt; Cartels &gt; Leniency]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The first firm to denounce existence of a [[cartel]] receives [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] from prosecution.
*If the firm is not the first to denounce its existence, it gets a 50% reduction in fines.
*If the firm co-operates with the Commission, acknowledging its culpability, it gets a 10% reduction in fines.
*If, once the investigation is opened, the firm gives additional information, it gets a 20-30% reduction in fines.

This policy has been of great success as it has increased cartel detection to such an extent that nowadays most cartel investigations are started according to the leniency policy. The purpose of a sliding scale in fine reductions is to encourage a "race to confess" among cartel members. In cross border or international investigations, cartel members are often at pains to inform not only the EU Commission, but also National Competition Authorities (e.g. the [[Office of Fair Trading]] and the ''[[Bundeskartellamt]]'') and authorities across the globe.

===National authorities===
;United Kingdom
{{main article|Office of Fair Trading|Competition Commission}}
Following the introduction of the Enterprise Act 2002 the Office of Fair Trading&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/ |title=Office of Fair Trading |publisher=Oft.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was responsible for enforcing competition law (enshrined in The Competition Act 1998) in the UK. These powers are shared with concurrent sectoral regulators such as Ofgem in energy, Ofcom in telecoms, the ORR in rail and Ofwat in water. The OFT was replaced by the [[Competition and Markets Authority]] (CMA), established on 1 April 2014, combining many of the functions of the OFT and the Competition Commission (CC).

It was first established in 1958 and comes under the authority of the Federal Ministry of the Economy and Technology. Its headquarters are in the former West German capital, Bonn and its president is Andreas Mundt, who has a staff of 300 people. Today it administers [[competition law]] in Germany, and is one of the leading national competition authorities in Europe.

;Poland
{{main article|Office of Competition and Consumer Protection}}
The Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK) was established in 1990 as the Antimonopoly Office. In 1989, on the verge of a political breakthrough, when the economy was based on the free market mechanisms, an Act on counteracting monopolistic practices was passed on 24 February 1990. It constituted an important element of the market reform programme. The structure of the economy, inherited from the central planning system, was characterised with a high level of monopolisation, which could significantly limit the success of the economic transformation. In this situation, promotion of competition and counteracting the anti-market behaviours of the monopolists was especially significant. Therefore, the Antimonopoly Office - AO (Urząd Antymonopolowy - UA) was appointed under this act, and commenced its operation in May once the Council of Ministers passed the charter. Also its first regional offices commenced operations in that very same year.

Right now the Office works under the name Office of Competition and Consumer Protection and bases its activities on the newly enacted Act on the Protection of Competition and Consumers from 2007.

===International cooperation===
{{See also|World Trade Organization|International Competition Network}}
[[File:WTO members and observers.svg|right|thumb|There is considerable controversy among [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] members, in green, whether competition law should form part of the agreements]]
Chapter 5 of the post war [[Havana Charter]] contained an Antitrust code&lt;ref&gt;see a speech by Wood, ''The Internationalisation of Antitrust Law: Options for the Future'' 3 February 1995, at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/speeches/future.txt&lt;/ref&gt; but this was never incorporated into the WTO's forerunner, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] 1947. [[Office of Fair Trading]] Director and Professor Richard Whish wrote sceptically that it "seems unlikely at the current stage of its development that the WTO will metamorphose into a global competition authority."&lt;ref&gt;Whish (2003) p. 448&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, at the ongoing [[Doha round]] of trade talks for the [[World Trade Organization]], discussion includes the prospect of competition law enforcement moving up to a global level. While it is incapable of enforcement itself, the newly established [[International Competition Network]]&lt;ref&gt;see, http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (ICN) is a way for national authorities to coordinate their own enforcement activities.

==State policy==

===Public services===
{{see also|Public economics|UK public service law|US public service law}}
Article 106(2) of the TFEU states that nothing in the rules can be used to obstruct a member state's right to deliver public services, but that otherwise public enterprises must play by the same rules on collusion and abuse of dominance as everyone else.

Services of general economic interest is more technical term for what are commonly called [[public services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-17570-2_8|title=Neue Wohnungsgemeinnützigkeit|last=Kuhnert|first=Jan|last2=Leps|first2=Olof|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden|isbn=9783658175696|pages=213–258|language=de|doi=10.1007/978-3-658-17570-2_8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement under the European Treaties was meant to preserve Europe's social character and institutions. Article 86 refers first of all to "undertakings", which has been defined to restrict the scope of competition law's application. In ''[[Cisal]]''&lt;ref&gt;C-218/00 ''[[Cisal di Battistello Venanzio and C. Sas v Instituto nazionale per l'assicurazione contro gli infortuni sul lavoro]]'' (''[[INAIL]]'') [2002] ECR I-691, para 31-45&lt;/ref&gt; a managing director challenged the state's compulsory workplace accident and disease insurance scheme. This was run by a body known as "''[[Istituto nazionale per l'assicurazione contro gli infortuni sul lavoro|INAIL]]''". The ECJ held that the competition laws in this instance were not applicable. "Undertaking" was a term that should be reserved for entities that carried on some kind of economic activity. ''[[INAIL]]'' operated according to the principle of [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]], because for example, contributions from high paid workers subsidise the low paid workers.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cisal]]'', para 42&lt;/ref&gt; Their activities therefore fall outside competition law's scope.

The substance of Article 106(2) also makes clear that competition law will be applied generally, but not where public services being provided might be obstructed. An example is shown in the ‘’Ambulanz Gloeckner’’ case.&lt;ref&gt;C-475/99 ''[[Ambulanz Gloeckner v Landkreis Suedwestpfalz]]'' [2001] ECR I-8089, para 52-65&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Rheinland Pfalz]], Germany, ambulances were provided exclusively by a company that also had the right to provide some non-emergency transport. The rationale was that ambulances were not profitable, not the other transport forms were, so the company was allowed to set profits of one sector off to the other, the alternative being higher taxation. The ECJ held that this was legitimate, clarfiying that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"the extension of the medical aid organisations’ exclusive rights to the non-emergency transport sector does indeed enable them to discharge their general-interest task of providing emergency transport in conditions of economic equilibrium. The possibility that would be open to private operators to concentrate, in the non-emergency sector, on more profitable journeys could affect the degree of economic viability of the service provided and, consequently, jeopardise the quality and reliability of that service."&lt;ref&gt;''Ambulanz Gloeckner'', para 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ECJ did however insist that demand on the "subsidising" market must be met by the state's regime. In other words, the state is always under a duty to ensure efficient service. Political concern for the maintenance of a social European economy was expressed during the drafting of the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], where a new Article 16 was inserted. This affirms, "the place occupied by services of general economic interest in the shared values of the Union as well as their role in promoting social and territorial cohesion." The ongoing debate is at what point the delicate line between the market and public services ought to be drawn.

EU Member states must not allow or assist businesses ("undertakings" in EU jargon) to infringe European Union competition law.&lt;ref&gt;see, C-311/85 ''[[Vereniging van Vlaamse Reisbureaus v ASBL Sociale Dienst van de Plaatselijke en Gewestelijke Overheidsdiensten]]'' [1987] ECR 3801, where a Belgian Royal decree incorporated a travel agent association code of conduct, which prohibited discounts (i.e. [[Price fixing|fixed prices]])&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[European Union]] is made up of independent [[Member state of the European Union|member states]], both competition policy and the creation of the European [[single market]] could be rendered ineffective were member states free to support national companies as they saw fit. A 2013 [[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas]] report lists some of the artifices used by participants to skirt the state aid rules on procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civitas.org.uk/economy/EUStateAidProcurement.pdf|title=civitias.org.uk: "Gamekeeper or poacher? Britain and the application of State aid and procurement policy in the European Union" (Garskarth) March 2013|publisher=|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Companies affected by article 106 may be state owned or privately owned companies which are given special rights such as near or total monopoly to provide a certain service. The leading case in 1991, ''[[Régie des Télegraphes et des Téléphones v GB-Inno-BM]]'',&lt;ref&gt;C-18/88, [1991] ECR 5941&lt;/ref&gt; which involved a small telephone equipment maker, GB and the Belgian state telephone provider, RTT, which had the exclusive power to grant approved phones to connect to the telephone network. GB was selling its phones, which were unapproved by RTT, and at lower prices than RTT sold theirs. RTT sued them, demanding that GB inform customers that their phones were unapproved. GB argued that the special rights enjoyed by RTT under Belgian law infringed Article 86, and the case went to the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ). The ECJ held that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"To entrust to an undertaking which markets telephone equipment the task of drawing up specifications for such equipment, of monitoring their application and granting type-approval in respect thereof is tantamount to conferring on it the power to determine at will which equipment can be connected to the public network and thus gives it an obvious advantage over its competitors which is inimical to the equality of chances of traders, without which the existence of an undistorted system of competition cannot be guaranteed. Such a restriction on competition cannot be regarded as justified by a public service of general economic interest..."&lt;ref&gt;para 25, ''[[RTT v GB]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ECJ recommended that the Belgian government have an independent body to approve phone specifications,&lt;ref&gt;para 26&lt;/ref&gt; because it was wrong to have the state company both making phones and setting standards. RTT's market was opened to competition. An interesting aspect of the case was that the ECJ interpreted the effect of RTT's exclusive power as an "abuse" of its dominant position,&lt;ref&gt;paragraphs 23 and 24&lt;/ref&gt; so no abusive "action" as such by RTT needed to take place. The issue was further considered in ''[[Albany International]]''&lt;ref&gt;C-67/96 ''[[Albany International BV v Stichting Bedrijfspensioenfonds Textielindustrie]]'' [1999] ECR I-5751&lt;/ref&gt; Albany was a textile company, which found a cheap pension provider for its employees. It refused to pay contributions to the "Textile Trade Industry Fund", which the state had given the exclusive right to. Albany argued that the scheme was contrary to EU Competition law. The ECJ ruled that the scheme infringed then Article 86(1), as "undertakings are unable to entrust the management of such a pension scheme to a single insurer and the resulting restriction of competition derives directly from the exclusive right conferred on the sectoral pension fund."&lt;ref&gt;''Albany'' [1999] ECR I-5751, para 97&lt;/ref&gt; But the scheme was justified under then Article 86(2), being a service of general economic interest.

===Procurement===
{{main article|Government procurement in the European Union}}

===State aid===
{{see also|State aid}}
Article 107 TFEU, similar to Article 101 TFEU, lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition, but has the power to approve exceptions for specific projects addressing natural disasters or regional development. The general definition of State Aid is set out in Article 107(1) of the TFEU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF |title=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Measures which fall within the definition of State Aid are unlawful unless provided under an exemption or notified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateaidlaw.com/index.php?q=what-is |title=A not-for-profit resource |publisher=State Aid Law |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For there to be State Aid under Article 107(1) of the TFEU each of the following must be present:
* There is the transfer of [[Member State]] resources;
* Which creates a selective advantage for one or more business undertakings;
* That has the potential to distort trade between in the relevant business market; and
* Affects trade between the Member States.

Where all of these criteria are met, State Aid is present and the support shall be unlawful unless provided under a European Commission exemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateaidlaw.com/index.php?q=present |title=A not-for-profit resource |publisher=State Aid Law |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[European Commission]] applies a number of exemptions which enable aid to be lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/legislation/legislation.html |title=European Commission - Competition |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commission]] will also approve State Aid cases under the notification procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/legislation/forms.html |title=European Commission - Competition |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the European Defense Agency deals with challenges to a "Level Playing Field for European Defence Industries: the Role of Ownership and Public Aid Practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/documents/Level_Playing_Field_Study|title=eda.europa.eu: "Level Playing Field for European Defence Industries: the Role of Ownership and Public Aid Practices" (2009)|publisher=|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State Aid law is an important issue for all public sector organisations and recipients of public sector support in the [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateaidlaw.com/index.php?q=why |title=A not-for-profit resource |publisher=State Aid Law |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; because unlawful aid can be clawed back with compound interest.

There is some scepticism about the effectiveness of competition law in achieving economic progress and its interference with the provision of public services. France's former president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] has called for the reference in the preamble to the [[Treaty of the European Union]] to the goal of "free and undistorted competition" to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;''Removal of competition clause causes dismay'', Tobias Buck and Bertrand Benoit, [[Financial Times]] p.6 June 23rd 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Though competition law itself would have remained unchanged, other goals of the preamble—which include "full employment" and "social progress"—carry the perception of greater specificity, and as being ends in themselves, while "free competition" is merely a means.

===Liberalisation===
{{see also|Liberalisation}}
The EU [[liberalisation]] programme entails a broadening of sector regulation, and extending [[competition law]] to previously state monopolised industries. The EU has also introduced positive integration measures to liberalise the internal market. There has at times been a tension between introduction of competition and the maintenance of universal and high quality service.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers (2006) p.1145&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Corbeau'' case,&lt;ref&gt;C-320/91 ''Corbeau'' [1993] ECR I-2533&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Corbeau had wanted to operate a rapid delivery service for post, which infringed the Belgian Regie des Postes' exclusive right to operate all services. The ECJ held the legislation would be contrary to Article 86 where it was excessive and unnecessary to guarantee the provision of services of general economic interest. It pointed out however that the postal regime (as was the case in most countries) allowed the post office to "offset less profitable sectors against the profitable sectors" of post operations. To provide universal service, a restriction of competition could be justified. The court went on to say,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"to authorise individual undertakings to compete with the holder of the exclusive rights in the sectors of their choice corresponding to those rights would make it possible for them to concentrate on the economically profitable operations and to offer more advantageous tariffs than those adopted by the holders of the exclusive rights since, unlike the latter, they are not bound for economic reasons to offset losses in the unprofitable sectors against profits in the more profitable sectors."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This meant a core of economic sectors in postal services could be reserved for financing the state industry. This was followed by the [[Postal Services Directive]] 97/67/EC,&lt;ref&gt;OJ L15/14, amended by Directive 2002/39/EC of 10 June 2003, OJ 2002 L176/21&lt;/ref&gt; which required Member States to "ensure that users enjoy the right to a universal service involving the permanent provision of a postal service... at all points in their territory."&lt;ref&gt;Directive 97/67/EC Art. 3(1)&lt;/ref&gt; This means once a working day deliveries and pick-ups, and that services that could be reserved for state monopolies include "clearance, sorting, transport and delivery of items of domestic correspondence and incoming cross-border correspondence".&lt;ref&gt;Directive 97/67/EC Art. 7(1)&lt;/ref&gt; For countries that had not liberalised postal services in any measure, the directive contained provisions to gradually open up to competition. It was intended to strike a balance between competition and continued quality service.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Directive 97/67/EC]] Praemble, "the reconciliation of the furtherance of the gradual, controlled liberalisation of the postal market and that of a durable guarantee of the provision of universal service."&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Deutsche Post'' decision&lt;ref&gt;OJ 2001 L125/27&lt;/ref&gt; the Commission took strong enforcement action. [[Deutsche Post]] was accused of [[predatory pricing]] in the business parcel delivery sector (i.e. not one of the services "reserved" under the directive) by the private firm [[United Parcel Service|UPS]]. The Commission ordered the structural separation of the normal postal services from business deliveries by Deutsche Post.&lt;ref&gt;see also, T-175/99 ''[[UPS Europe v Commission]]'' [2002] ECR II-1915, para 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
{{main article|Competition law theory}}
[[File:Monopoly-surpluses.svg|thumb|right|The economist's depiction of [[deadweight loss]] to efficiency that monopolies cause]]
Article 101 TFEU's goals are unclear. There are two main schools of thought. The predominant view is that only consumer welfare considerations are relevant there.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52010XC0330(02):EN:NOT Commission's Article 101(3) Guidelines], the Court of First Instance's recent Glaxo Case and certain academic works, such as Okeoghene Odudu, ''The boundaries of EC competition law: the scope of article 81'' (OUP 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; However, a recent book argues that this position is erroneous and that other Member State and European Union public policy goals (such as public health and the environment) should also be considered there.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Townley, ''Article 81 EC and Public Policy'' (Hart 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; If this argument is correct then it could have a profound effect on the outcome of cases&lt;ref&gt;The ECJ's judgement in the ''Glaxo'' case is eagerly awaited, for example.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Modernisation process as a whole.

The theory behind mergers is that transaction costs can be reduced compared to operating on an open market through bilateral contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coase |first=Ronald H. |authorlink=Ronald H. Coase |date=November 1937 |title=The Nature of the Firm |journal=Economica |volume=4 |issue=16 |pages=386–405 |url=http://www.cerna.ensmp.fr/Enseignement/CoursEcoIndus/SupportsdeCours/COASE.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=10 February 2007 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113063048/http://www.cerna.ensmp.fr/Enseignement/CoursEcoIndus/SupportsdeCours/COASE.pdf |archivedate=13 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations can increase [[economies of scale]] and scope. However, often firms take advantage of their increase in market power, their increased market share and decreased number of competitors, which can have a knock on effect on the deal that consumers get. Merger control is about predicting what the market might be like, not knowing and making a judgment.

The '''Fishery Limits Act 1976''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (1977 c. 86) in order to implement the extension of fishing waters under the [[European Community]]'s [[Common Fisheries Policy]] into British law.

The Act extended the fishing limits from {{convert|12|nmi|lk=on}} to {{convert|200|nmi}} and was in force with the members of the EEC and nine other countries. [[Iceland]], with whom the [[United Kingdom]] had clashed over fishing rights in the so-called "[[Cod War]]", was not included due to separate negotiations with the EEC.

{{short description|bishop}}
'''Guillaume Besaucèle''' (Saissac, 3 September 1712{{snd}}Carcassonne, 4 February 1801) was an ecclesiastic who was constitutional [[Diocese of Aude|bishop of Aude]] from 1791 to 1801.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tableau des Evêques constitutionnels de France de 1791 à 1801 classés dans l'ordre des Métropoles établi d'après le décret de l'Assemblée constituante|author=Église constitutionnelle|date=1827|publisher=Méquignon-Havard|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=fsT2yXyAtPIC|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Besaucèle had been Dean of the Chapter of Carcassone before the Revolution. He was consecrated at Toulouse by Archbishop Antoine-Pascal-Hyacinthe Sermet of the Haute-Garonne on 15 May 1791.  He was 78 years old.  {{cite book|author=Paul Pisani|title=Répertoire biographique de l'épiscopat constitutionnel (1791-1802).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAQ9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA434|year=1907|publisher=A. Picard et fils|location=Paris|language=French |pages=371–374 and 457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Guillaume Besaucèle was pastor of Limousis before becoming the vicar general of Armand Bazin de Bezons, bishop of Carcassonne clearly Jansenist, then canon and finally dean of the chapter of the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Pisani, Biographical Directory of the Constitutional Episcopate (1791–1802), A. Picard &amp; Fils, (Paris, 1907), p.  371-374.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], he pronounced for the Civil Constitution of the clergy to mark his opposition to the former bishop [[Jean Auguste of Chastenet de Puységur]] and at the age of 79, he was elected constitutional bishop of the diocese of Aude, established by the revolutionary government, which partially included the diocese of Narbonne and four former bishoprics of [[Carcassonne]], Alet, [[Saint-Papoul]] and [[Mirepoix, Ariège|Mirepoix]]. To avoid too long a trip, he was crowned in [[Toulouse]] on 15 May 1791. The episcopal see is first fixed in the old metropolitan church of Narbonne. The new elect, despite his age, undertakes a general visit of his diocese which includes no less than 567 parishes. He realized only 3/4 of his program during the suppression of the cults in 1793. He is not worried during the Terror and resumes his functions in February 1795 while fixing however his residence in Carcassonne which he estimates more Central. He adheres to the encyclicals and sends deputies to the Council of 1797.

He had difficulties in leading his vast [[diocese]] and he sets up separate administrations for the four [[bishopric]]s that compose him and is surrounded by 22 [[vicar]]s general. In 1797 he suffered a stroke and on 17 July 1797 at the meeting of a synod of the Southern Metropolis and it becomes clear that he is better able to administer his diocese. The metropolitan imposes on him a coadjutor in the person of Louis Belmas, the priest of Castelnaudary whom he crowned 26 October 1800.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dcarc.html Diocese of Carcassonne et Narbonne].&lt;/ref&gt;

The old bishop died on 4 February 1801. He was buried in the cemetery of the city of Carcassonne in the same tomb as Bishop de Bezons.

The '''Heritage Property Act''' is a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] [[statute]] which allows for the preservation of [[cultural heritage]] properties, [[archaeological site]]s and [[Paleontology|palaeontological sites]] in the province of [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="Act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Property Act|url=http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/English/Statutes/Statutes/H2-2.pdf|work=Publications Centre - Legislation|publisher=Government of Saskatchewan|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural heritage properties==

The Act offers two types of protection:

===Provincial Heritage Properties===
Provincial Heritage Properties are provincially significant places designated by the Minister of Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport.  As of March 2013, there are 50 such sites in Saskatchewan.  Once designated, the property's heritage character-defining elements cannot be altered without the written consent from the Minister, and the site is also eligible for financial assistance from the Saskatchewan Heritage Foundation towards its preservation or restoration.&lt;ref name="CHP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage|url=http://www.tpcs.gov.sk.ca/Designation|work=Designating a Heritage Property|publisher=Parks, Culture and Sport|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal Heritage Properties===
Locally  or regionally significant places can be designated by a [[List of cities in Saskatchewan|city]], [[List of towns in Saskatchewan|town]], [[List of villages in Saskatchewan|village]] or [[List of rural municipalities in Saskatchewan|rural municipality]].  Designation legally protects the property and makes it eligible for financial assistance from the Saskatchewan Heritage Foundation.  There are over 750 Municipal Heritage Properties in the province.&lt;ref name="CHP"/&gt;

The Act also permits municipalities to designate Municipal Heritage Conservation Districts, [[Historic district|larger areas]] whose heritage value lies in their overall area character rather than in individual properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating community heritage programs: A guide for municipalities|url=http://www.tpcs.gov.sk.ca/HeritageProgramsGuide|publisher=Saskatchewan Ministry of Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological and palaeontological sites==

The Act protects [[Archaeology in Saskatchewan|archaeological and palaeontological sites and objects in Saskatchewan]].  In particular, every archaeological or palaeontological object found in, or taken from, land in Saskatchewan is deemed to be the property of the [[Monarchy in Saskatchewan|Crown]], and no person may disturb or dislocate such objects without a valid permit issued under the Act.&lt;ref name="Act"/&gt;

Also protected are Sites of Special Interest, consisting of [[First Nations]] or [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] sites which the Act defines as properties containing any [[Pictogram|pictographs]], [[petroglyph]]s, human skeletal material, burial objects, burial places or mounds, boulder effigies or medicine wheels.  No one may destroy, deface, excavate or alter such sites.&lt;ref name="Act"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archaeological Heritage: Sites of a Special Nature|url=http://www.tpcs.gov.sk.ca/SSNvisitorguide|publisher=Government of Saskatchewan|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other provisions==

The Act also provides for:&lt;ref name="Act"/&gt;
*the establishment of the Saskatchewan Heritage Foundation, a provincial agency whose primary mandate is to provide financial support to heritage projects within the province;
*the establishment of the [[Geographic names board|Saskatchewan Geographic Names Program]];
*the issuance of temporary stop orders requiring a person to cease an activity for up to 60 days where that activity that is likely to result in damage or destruction to any heritage property; 
*the voluntary registration of heritage [[easement]]s and [[Covenant (law)|covenants]], pursuant to which a landowner agrees to terms and conditions with the province, a municipality or any other heritage organization approved by the Minister ensuring the protection of the heritage property; and

'''[[Intellectual property]]''' (IP) consists of four kinds: [[patent]], [[trademark]], [[copyright]], and [[trade secret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bramson|first=R.S.|date=1981|title=Intellectual property as collateral — patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights.|url=|journal=The Business Lawyer|volume=36|pages=1567-1604|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to understand these areas and use them correctly, a person needs to be trained and educated. That training may be delivered through various types of resources, including webinars, college courses, webpages, and books. Intellectual property education should teach the individual what these areas are, what aspects of the law apply to them, and how to understand normal situations which might arise regarding those specific area.  Because of its importance, intellectual property education should be available to people of all age groups and education levels. Because intellectual property laws are specific to each country, training on the topic is also specific to each country.

Copyright protects original expression of ideas in different forms, but not the ideas themselves. The goal of copyright law is to encourage individual and business entities to produce original work by rewarding them with exclusive rights for their benefits, which is subject to time and statutory exceptions.

As outlined in the United States Copyright Office's guide, [https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf Circular 1: Copyright Basics]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;United States Copyright Office, Library of Congress. (2017).  ''Copyright Basics'' (Circular 1). Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;, a work is given copyright protection once it is fixed within a tangible medium, which includes "written works, musical works, dramatic works, pantomimes and choreographic works, pictorial works, graphic works, sculptural works, motion pictures and other audiovisual works, sound recordings, and architectural works." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The copyright protection given to the work provides the owner of the work with specific rights including the right to reproduce the work, the right to create a derivative work, the right to perform the work, the right to display the work, and the right to distribute copies of the work. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Governing Laws of Copyright ==

=== Constitution ===
United States copyrights law is based in U.S. Constitution, which authorizes Congress to provide authors with certain exclusive rights in their writings for a limited period of time.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/10617&lt;/nowiki&gt; U.S.C.A. § 106&lt;/ref&gt; The "writings" is a broad term, which means any work of original expression in any form or medium, including literary, artistic, musical and etc.. "Authors" is also a broad term, which includes all creators of works.

=== Copyright Act of 1976 ===
Copyright law is primarily governed by federal statute and the current controlling statute is Copyright Act of 1976, as amended.[https://www.copyright.gov/title17/title17.pdf] Under the [[Supremacy Clause|Supremacy Clause of Constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const. art. 6, cl. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;, with few exceptions, the Copyright Act of 1976 preempts state law.

=== Regulations ===
The US Copyright Office administers copyrights authorized by the Copyright Act, whose functions include rulemaking, regulate copyright registration, administering statutory and compulsory licenses. It also provides legal and regulatory background information as well as procedural guidance on its [https://copyright.gov/ website].

=== TEACH Act ===
The federal [[TEACH Act]] (Technology, Education, and Copyright Harmonization Act of 2002) was signed in November 2002, and governs the use of copyrighted materials in online learning environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://copyright.cornell.edu/teach-act|title=New Copyright Legislation (TEACH Act) {{!}} Copyright Information Center|website=copyright.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TEACH Act eases some of the rules put in place by the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://er.educause.edu/articles/2006/1/managing-intellectual-property-for-distance-learning|title=Managing Intellectual Property for Distance Learning|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities, including the University of Washington,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/uwcopy/Copyright_Law/TEACH_Act/|title=UW Copyright Connection : TEACH Act : TEACH Act|website=depts.washington.edu|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide information about compliance with the TEACH Act, often related to the use of [[Learning management system|learning management systems]]

=== State Law ===
Though the Copyright Act preempts state law, state law covers the issues which is outside the scope of Copyright Act, such as works of authorship that have not been expressed in a tangible medium(outside of scope of "[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102 fixed in any tangible medium of expression]"&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 102(a)&lt;/ref&gt;), right not equivalent to any of the "[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106 exclusive rights]"&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 106&lt;/ref&gt;, etc..

=== International Copyright Treaties ===
International copyright treaties between U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions is enforceable in U.S. territory under the Supremacy Clause, including: [[Berne Convention|The Berne Convention]], [[Universal Copyright Convention|The Universal Copyright Convention]], [[WIPO Copyright Treaty|The WIPO Copyright Treaty]], [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty|The WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]], [[Geneva Phonograms Convention|The Geneva Phonograms Convention]] and [[TRIPS Agreement|TRIPS]]. While their specific terms are different, two fundamental rules govern each member under each treaty: member countries must meet certain minimum standards for copyright protection in their local law and provide reciprocal treatment to copyright owners in other member jurisdictions. The copyright law provided by each jurisdiction is based on its own national laws.

== Popular Topics ==

=== Fair Use ===
[[Fair use]] is one important topic in Copyright and Intellectual Property Education. Fair use law allows for limited use of copyrighted materials without seeking and/or acquiring copyright clearance from the copyright owner. There are four factors of fair use: (1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount or portion used of the work, and (4) the effect of the use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/461034081|title=Copyright and cultural institutions: Guidelines for digitization for U.S. libraries, archives, and museums|last=Hirtle|first=Peter, B.|date=|publisher=Cornell University Library|others=Hudson, Emily., &amp; Kenyon, Andrew T.|year=2009|isbn=9780935995107|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|pages=|oclc=461034081}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Faculty, staff, and students may find a [https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics/fair-use/fair-use-checklist.html#Fair%20Use%20Checklist Fair Use Checklist] helpful when determining whether or not their use of a material would fall under fair use. Columbia University Libraries' [https://copyright.columbia.edu/index.html Copyright Advisory Services] provides their own [https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics/fair-use/fair-use-checklist.html#Fair%20Use%20Checklist Fair Use Checklist] and information about fair use law, as well as other information regarding copyright&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://copyright.columbia.edu/index.html|title=Copyright Advisory Services|last=|first=|date=|website=Columbia University Libraries|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

For further clarification on Fair Use and how to determine if a person's use falls under that exception, Stanford University has a [https://fairuse.stanford.edu/charts-and-tools/ Charts and Tools] section on their website. This website includes links to codes of best practices - including the Center for Media &amp; Social Impact's [http://cmsimpact.org/code/code-best-practices-fair-use-media-literacy-education/ Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Media Literacy Education], a [http://dirc.vraweb.org/ Digital Image Rights Computator] to help a user discover if an image they wish to use is copyrighted, and a [http://navigator.carolon.net/ Copyright Navigator] that provides basic information on how copyright law works. Each of the links on the website equips a user with enough resources to determine if their use of a copyrighted material falls under the protection of Fair Use.

The legislative intent for fair use in Section 107 in Copyright Act is stated as following: "the bill endorses the purpose and general scope of the judicial doctrine of fair use, but there is no disposition to freeze the doctrine in the statute, especially during a period of rapid technological change. Beyond a very broad statutory explanation of what fair use is and some of the criteria applicable to it, the courts must be free to adapt the doctrine to particular situations on a case-by-case basis. Section 107 is intended to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair use, not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any way."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://law.resource.org/pub/us/works/aba/ibr/H.Rep.94-1476.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; H.R. REP. 94-1476, 66, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5680&lt;/ref&gt;  It means courts have broad discretion to decide fair use application. U.S. Copyright Office creates a [https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html Fair Use Index] which summarizes the newest case law development in fair use. 

=== Public Domain ===
[[Public Domain]] is another important concept in Copyright and Intellectual Property Education. If a work is in public domain - i.e., if its copyright has expired, been lost, or was never given - that work may be used by anyone. In order to help determine if a work is in Public Domain, Cornell University provides a [https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain Public Domain Flow Chart] to help users identify if a work is protected by copyright law. Stanford University Libraries' guide, [https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/ Welcome to the Public Domain], also provides in-depth information that can help users identify how a work enters the public domain based on the date it was published. For example, within the United States, all works that were created prior to 1923 are currently within the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford University Libraries (2018). Copyright &amp; Fair Use: Welcome to the Public Domain. ''Stanford University''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In order to further understand copyright and public domain, the [https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809 Copy This Podcast] provides listeners with a brief history of Copyright Law and Public Domain. Each podcast is approximately twelve minutes long and covers topics such as "[https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809/pop-culture-and-the-public-domain Pop Culture and the Public Domain]," "[https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809/you-use-it-more-than-you-realize Fair Use: You Use It More Than You Realize]," and "[https://soundcloud.com/user-864134809/notice-and-takedown-leave-it-be Notice and Takedown: Leave it Be]." Each of these podcasts features experts and scholars of copyright law and can provide users with information about how to navigate the world of copyright. 

=== Orphan Works ===
[[Orphan work|Orphan works]], or works where the creator or rightsholder is unable to be determined, are an important current topic in copyright law. There is currently no legislation in the United States place to fully address this issue, though progress has been made specifically for music with the [[Music Modernization Act]] in 2018. 

After the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], copyright holders were no longer required to register copyrighted works, which benefited copyright holders by simplifying the process to obtain and maintain copyright protection, but in turn complicated the process for potential users of copyrighted material to determine ownership over certain works as the central register for copyrighted materials was no longer deemed necessary. This made any usage of copyrighted materials outside of fair use a violation of copyright, but did not take into account the drastic changes of access and dissemination that would soon occur due to digitization and the internet. 

In 2006 the U.S. Copyright Office held a study and released a report on orphan works&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/orphan/orphan-report.pdf|title=Report on Orphan Works|last=A Report of the Register of Copyrights|first=|date=January 2006|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The main conclusion was that new legislation was needed to address this issue, and that clearly delineated steps need to be identified for potential users of such works, as well as protocols set in place for when an author comes forward. 

Another report, ‘Orphan Works and Mass Digitization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/orphan/reports/orphan-works2015.pdf|title=Orphan Works and Mass Digitization|last=A Report of the Register of Copyrights|first=|date=June 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;’ was completed in 2012 with particular focus on how how efforts to preserve copyrighted material needed to be balanced with reasonable access to the work. This report laid out the prospective changes needed to alter the outdated legislation and better serve current informational needs. 

It is also important to note that in 2013, the UK passed a copyright act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/copyright-orphan-works|title=Guidance: Copyright: orphan works|last=Intellectual Property Office|first=|date=May 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that permitted usage of orphan works as long as a diligent effort was made and certain conditions were met, such as filing a ‘notice of use’ for the work.

==Cases==
In the [[Cassis de Dijon Case]], the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled the German laws prohibiting sales of liquors with alcohol percentages between 15% and 25% conflicted with [[EU laws]]. This ruling confirmed that [[EU law]] has [[wikt:primacy|primacy]] over [[member-state law]].&lt;ref&gt;EUabc – Cassis de Djion case: http://en.euabc.com/word/140&lt;/ref&gt;
When the [[treaties]] are unclear, they leave room for the Court to interpret them in different ways. When [[EU treaties]] are negotiated, it is difficult to get all governments to agree on a clear set of laws. In order to get a compromise, governments agree to leave a decision on an issue to the Court. &lt;ref&gt; Bache, Ian and Stephen George (2006). Politics in the European Union, 2nd ed., Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
The Court can only practice [[judicial activism]] to the extent the EU Governments leave room for interpretation in the [[treaties]].&lt;ref&gt;Moravcsik, A. (2002) ‘In defense of the democratic deficit: reassessing legitimacy in the European Union’ Journal of Common Market Studies. Vol 40, Issue 4 &lt;/ref&gt;
The Court makes important rulings that set the agenda for further [[EU integration]], but it cannot happen without the consensual support of the [[member-states]].&lt;ref&gt;Moravcsik, A. (2002) ‘In defense of the democratic deficit: reassessing legitimacy in the European Union’ Journal of Common Market Studies. Vol 40, Issue 4 &lt;/ref&gt;
The most recent case of [[judicial activism]] of the [[European Court of Justice]] is the [[Metock case]] which determined that the strict [[Denmark|Danish]] and [[Irish immigration laws]] conflict with [[EU laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Metock case brings down Danish immigration laws http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/3457&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lisbon Treaty==
In the [[Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty]] many issues not directly related to the treaty, such as [[abortion]] were included in the debate because of worries that the [[Lisbon Treaty]] will enable the [[European Court of Justice]] to make activist rulings in these areas.
After the rejection of the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in Ireland, the [[Irish Government]] received concessions from the rest of the [[member states of the European Union]] to make written guarantees that the EU will under no circumstances interfere with Irish abortion, taxation or military neutrality. &lt;ref&gt;Irish secure concessions on Lisbon Treaty: http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2008/12/irish-secure-concessions-on-lisbon-treaty/63409.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ireland]] voted on the [[Lisbon Treaty]] a second time in 2009, with a 67.13% majority voting Yes to the treaty.

The '''Legitimacy Act 1926''' was an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The purpose of the Legitimacy Act 1926 was to amend the law relating to children born out of wedlock.

==Act==
The fundamental principle of the Legitimacy Act 1926 is exposed in article 1(2):  
"''Nothing in this Act shall operate to legitimate a person whose father or mother was married to a third person when the illegitimate person was born''."
The Act allowed children to be legitimised by the subsequent marriage of their parents, provided that neither parent had been married to a third party at the time of the birth. In those circumstances, the legitimised birth was re-entered in the birth indexes for that year (sometimes many years after the original birth). The original entry would be annotated to refer to the new entry.

The act was modified by the [[Legitimacy Act 1959]], which extended it to children whose parent(s) had been married to somebody else when they were born.

'''Ms. JD''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit, nonpartisan organization&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidestar.org/pqShowGsReport.do?partner=networkforgood&amp;ein=20-5112363 Guidestar Organization Report]&lt;/ref&gt; that promotes women in the [[legal profession]] and provides an online forum for dialogue and [[social network|networking]] among women lawyers and law students in all arenas of the legal profession. Ms. JD was created in 2006, by women law students from 12 [[law schools]] from around the [[United States]].   Ms. JD's mission is to reinforce and expand the representation of women in [[law school]] and the [[legal profession]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ms-jd.org/about Ms. JD Mission Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Ms. JD disseminates information and fosters dialogue about and for women in the law.   In addition, Ms. JD provides summer [[scholarships]] to law students working in government or public interest positions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tourolawcso.blogspot.com/2008/05/ms-jd-2008-summer-scholarship.html Ms. JD 2008 Summer Scholarship], Touro Law Center Career Services Office, May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; sponsors writing contests that expand the dialogue about key issues affecting women lawyers,&lt;ref&gt;Project for Attorney Retention. [http://lawyersworklife.blogspot.com/2008/04/par-and-ms-jd-announce-essay-contest.html PAR and Ms. JD Announce Essay Contest Winners], April 1, 2008. Accessed June 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and organizes conferences and networking events for women lawyers and law students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.yale.edu/news/4750.htm Yale Law Women Host “Legally Female” Conference; Dean Koh Gives Opening Remarks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908054724/http://www.law.yale.edu/news/4750.htm |date=2008-09-08 }}, Yale Law School Website, February 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Through its online website, Ms. JD explores the work of female attorneys, provides networking opportunities, offers critical analysis of relevant news, and discussions for women about their chosen fields of law. Ms. JD also spotlights women in the law and explores women-friendly practices across a spectrum of legal institutions.

==History==
Though women comprise approximately half of the student body of American law schools, they represent only 17% of partners at major law firms and less than a quarter of tenured law professors. Similarly, on the national level, we have had only one female U.S. Attorney General, three female Secretaries of State, three women Supreme Court Justices, and one acting Solicitor General.  Concerned by the rates at which women opt out of the legal profession, the lack of representation of women in the highest courts and echelons of the legal community, and the role of gender in the progression of many women's legal careers,&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Alison. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1117023#PaperDownload Women Lawyers Blog for Workplace Equality: Blogging as a Feminist Legal Method], March 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; a group of female law students from [[UC Berkeley]], [[Cornell]], [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], [[Harvard]], [[NYU]], [[Stanford]], [[UCLA]], [[UT Austin]], the [[University of Chicago]], the [[University of Michigan]], the [[University of Virginia]], and [[Yale Law School]] came together and created Ms. JD in March 2006 at a two-day conference hosted by [[Stanford Law School]]. In 2006, Ms. JD incorporated in the state of [[California]] and received [[501(c)(3)]] charitable status from the [[Internal Revenue Service]].  On March 31, 2007, Ms. JD publicly launched its website at a national conference co-hosted by Yale Law Women and hosted at [[Yale Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, Nora. [http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/20504 "Panel Heralds New ‘Ms. J.D.’ Web log"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905003729/http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/20504 |date=2008-09-05 }}, ''Yale Daily News'', April 07, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Women's Law School Coalition (WLSC) merged with Ms. JD in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Birnbaum, Jeffrey.

==NWLSO==
In April 2008, Ms. JD launched the National Women Law Students' Organization (NWLSO) in [[New York City]] with representatives from more than 70 law schools in 33 states represented.&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, Molly. "Work/Life Balance Blog [http://www.abajournal.com/news/work_life_balance_blog_ms_jd_morphs_into_natl_law_student_org/ ‘Ms. JD’ Spawns Nat’l Law Student Org."], ''ABA Journal'', April 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Keynote remarks were provided by Chief [[Judge]] [[Judith Kaye]] of the [[New York Court of Appeals]]; [[Barbara Babcock]], the first female professor at [[Stanford Law School]]; and [[Dahlia Lithwick]], senior editor and legal correspondent for [[Slate.com]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Abigail. [http://www.usd.edu/law/08WILnwlso.pdf Conference Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613024345/http://www.usd.edu/law/08WILnwlso.pdf |date=2008-06-13 }}, University of South Dakota School of Law, 2008. ''See also'' [http://www.pace.edu/page.cfm?doc_id=30713 Pace Law School Sends Delegates to National Women Law Students Leadership Summit], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

NWLSO connects women law students across the country to identify common goals and share knowledge and support with one another and sponsor networking and informational events across the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16147">The '''National Building Code of Canada''' is the [[model building code]] of [[Canada]]. It is issued by [[National Research Council Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/publications/codes_centre/2010_national_building_code.html NRC Website]&lt;/ref&gt; As a model code, it has no legal status until it is adopted by a jurisdiction that regulates construction.

==History==
The [[Constitution of Canada]] includes the regulation of building construction as a provincial responsibility. In a few cases, municipalities have been given the historic right of writing their own [[building code]]. In the early years of regulating building construction, this caused a patchwork of building codes across Canada.

In 1941, the federal government of Canada published the first National Building Code. This was adopted by the various provinces and municipalities in Canada during the next 20 years.

On 1 August 1947, the '''Division of Building Research''', later named the '''Institute for Research in Construction''' (NRC-IRC), was established to provide a research service to the construction industry and to help ensure affordable and safe housing for a growing population of Canadians. Its founding head was [[Robert Legget]]. The new organization was also given the mandate to lead the development of the National Building Code of Canada. Since then, NRC-IRC has grown to encompass emergent areas of research in support of the Canadian construction sector.&lt;ref name=irc&gt;[http://archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/ibp/irc.html archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca: "NRC Institute for Research in Construction"]&lt;/ref&gt; Early photographs of activities are available in the archives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dr-dn.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/browse/images/?al=Division+of+Building+Research&amp;cn=nrcarchivesphotographs dr-dn.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca: "Pictures: Division of Building Research"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Northern Research Program''' was housed at the Division of Building Research over the period from 1950 to 1986,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgs.ca/archival-records.php cgs.ca: "Information and Location for Archival Records"]&lt;/ref&gt; and information gleaned from the '''Building Materials Section''' in [[York Redoubt]] made its way into the Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.mun.ca/cdm/ref/collection/sjcarew/id/459 collections.mun.ca: "National Research Council of Canada, Division of Building Research, Building Materials Section"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1960, there has been a revised document about every five years up to 1995. The 2000 edition of the building code was supposed to be an objective or performance-based building. However, this took considerably longer to write than foreseen and the next edition of the National Building Code of Canada was not published until 2005.  The 2010 National Model Construction Codes was published on 29 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/ibp/irc/ci/v15no3/1.html nrc-cnrc.gc.ca: ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129044618/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/ibp/irc/ci/v15no3/1.html |date=November 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Building Code of Canada 2010 incorporates energy efficiency requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/publications/codes_centre/2010_national_building_code.html nrc-cnrc.gc.ca: "National Building Code of Canada 2010"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first National Farm Building Code of Canada (NFBC) was first published in 1960. The Model National Energy Codes for Buildings and Houses were first published in 1997.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

The Historical National Construction Codes on-line in PDF format is a single collection provided by the NRC of the English and French editions of all Code documents published between 1941 and 1998.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/publications/codes_centre/historical_codes.html nrc-cnrc.gc.ca: "Historical Editions of the National Construction Codes (1941-1998)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On behalf of the Canadian Commission on Building and Fire Codes (CCBFC) the National Research Council (NRC) Canadian Codes Center publishes national model codes documents that set out minimum requirements relating to their scope and objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/advisory/codes_centre_index.html nrc-cnrc.gc.ca: "Canadian Codes Centre"]&lt;/ref&gt; These include the National Building Code, the National Fire Code, the National Plumbing Code, the National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings (NECB) and other documents. The [[Canadian Standards Association]] (CSA) publishes other model codes that address electrical, gas and elevator systems.

Requirements on the specification of structural wood products and wood building systems is set forth in the National Building Code which is concerned with health, safety, accessibility and the protection of buildings from fire or structural damage. The Code applies mainly to new construction, but also aspects of demolition, relocation, renovation and change of building use. The current NBCC was published in 2015, and is usually updated on a five-year cycle. The next update is expected in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cwc.ca/design-with-wood/building-code/ cwc.ca: "Building Code - Canada’s National Code System"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
The National Building Code is the model building code that forms the basis for all of the provincial building codes.  Some jurisdictions create their own code based on the National Building Code, other jurisdictions have adopted the National Building often with supplementary laws or regulations to the requirements in the National Building Code.

===Alberta===
By agreement with the National Research Council of Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca National Research Council of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alberta]] is committed to using the National Building Code of Canada as its base document with changes and modifications to suit Alberta needs in regulating the design, construction, alteration, change of use and demolition of buildings.

The Alberta Building Code 2006 was established by the Building Technical Council, a

===British Columbia===
The [[British Columbia]] Building Code&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bccodes.ca/building-code.aspx?vid=QPLEGALEZE:bccodes_2012_view bccodes.ca: "BC Building Code 2012"]&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the core concepts of the National Building Code with some variations specific to the province. The Code applies throughout British Columbia, except for some Federal lands and the City of Vancouver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.housing.gov.bc.ca/building/code_questions/index.htm#01 housing.gov.bc.ca: "Ask a Building Code Question"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Code is published by Crown Publications.

====Vancouver====
Under the [[Vancouver Building Bylaw]], [[Vancouver]] has developed its own building code based on the National Building Code.

===Ontario===
The [[Ontario]] Building Code&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_060350_e.htm e-laws.gov.on.ca: "O. Reg. 350/06: BUILDING COD under Building Code Act, 1992, S.O. 1992, c. 23"]&lt;/ref&gt; is administered by the Building and Development Branch of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page7393.aspx mah.gov.on.ca: "Ontario Building Code"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the enactment of the first Ontario Building Code Act in 1974, individual municipalities were responsible for developing their own building codes, resulting in a fragmented and potentially confusing regulatory environment. The introduction of a provincial Building Code Act and a provincial Building Code addressed this problem by providing for uniform construction standards across Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page9263.aspx mah.gov.on.ca: "About Ontario’s Building Code"]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of Jan. 1, 2012 the benchmark requirements for energy efficiency regarding houses and large buildings was enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page9715.aspx?DateTime=634608476400000000&amp;PageMode=View CodeNews Issue No. 201]&lt;/ref&gt; Updated compliance paths for energy efficiency requirements in large buildings are set out in Supplementary Standard SB-10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=9227 Supplementary Standard SB-10]&lt;/ref&gt; Residential buildings intended for occupancy on a continuing basis during the winter months must meet the performance levels specified in Supplementary Standard SB-12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Asset9372.aspx?method=1 mah.gov.on.ca: "Supplementary Standard SB-12"]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 1, 2012 the Ontario Building Code was amended to address the issue of balcony glass breaking on newly constructed buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page9962.aspx?DateTime=634758940800000000&amp;PageMode=View mah.gov.on.ca: "CodeNews Issue No. 204 - Glass Guards"]&lt;/ref&gt; The new amendment, Supplementary Standard SB-13, "Glass in Guards"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=9717 mah.gov.on.ca: "Supplementary Standard SB-13, 'Glass in Guards'"]&lt;/ref&gt; is intended to help minimize the likelihood that balcony glass will break on newly constructed buildings and help reduce the chance of broken pieces falling to the ground below if balcony glass does break.

===Quebec===
The Building Act provides for the adoption of a Construction Code and a Safety Code for buildings, equipment intended for use by the public, and electric, plumbing, and pressure installations as well as installations intended to use, store, or distribute gas. Whereas the Construction Code applies to plan and estimate designers (architects, engineers, technologists) and contractors, the Safety Code is intended for owners of buildings, equipment, and facilities.

These two codes are adopted chapter by chapter and are progressively replacing the seven laws and thirty-odd regulations that were previously in effect. The goal of this process is, obviously, to simplify regulations, but also to better define the responsibilities of owners and construction professionals.

In force since November 7, 2000. The ''Code de construction du Québec''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rbq.gouv.qc.ca/en/laws-regulations-and-codes/construction-code-and-safety-code.html rbq.gouv.qc.ca: "Construction Code and Safety Code"]&lt;/ref&gt; Consisting of the National Construction Code – 2005, amended and includes Part 10 for existing buildings.

The Quebec ''Code de Construction'' is not compulsory in the province. Municipalities have the option of adopting the code of their choice, with or without modifications. In fact, many municipalities do not have any building code officially in effect.

For example, since 2013 the ''Régie du bâtiment du Québec'' has adopted a new code (Bill 122) that requires all owners of buildings that are 5 storeys and higher which are older than 1958 to conduct a facade inspection of the building by an engineer. This code is exclusive to the province.

===Other provinces===
[[Prince Edward Island]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.pe.ca/law/statutes/pdf/p-24.pdf gov.pe.ca: "CHAPTER P-24 - PROVINCIAL BUILDING CODE ACT"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nova Scotia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/statutes/buildcod.htm gov.ns.ca: dead link]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembly.nl.ca/legislation/sr/regulations/rc961140.htm: "CONSOLIDATED NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR REGULATION 1140/96"]&lt;/ref&gt; have legislation enforcing the current version of the National Building Code of Canada. [[Manitoba]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/b093e.php: "The Buildings and Mobile Homes Act"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Brunswick]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.gnb.ca/en/ShowPdf/cr/2002-45.pdf: "NEW BRUNSWICK REGULATION 2002-45"]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saskatchewan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sboa.sk.ca/ sboa.sk.ca: "About SBOA"]&lt;/ref&gt; have adopted the 2010 National Building Code as regulations under provincial acts.

===Federal jurisdiction===
For most construction under federal jurisdiction the National Building Code of Canada is the applicable Code.  Property under federal jurisdiction includes military bases, federal government land and airports. First Nations land (as defined by the Indian Act - land set aside for the exclusive use of First Nations) may choose to adopt the National Building &amp; Fire Codes through a Band Resolution or By Law, however the National Building and Fire codes are not legally enforceable.

==Content==
The intent of the Building Code is to detail the minimum provisions acceptable to maintain the safety of buildings, with specific regard to public health, fire protection, accessibility and structural sufficiency. It is not a textbook for building design. The Building Code concerns [[construction]], [[renovation]], and [[demolition]]. It also covers change of use projects where the change would result in increased hazard and/or maintenance and operation in the existing building. The Code sets out technical requirements for the aforementioned project types and does not pertain to existing buildings.

The 1995 National Building Code is split into 9 parts.
*Part 1 Scope and Definitions
*Part 2 General Requirements
*Part 3 Fire Protection, Occupant Safety and Accessibility
*Part 4 Structural Design
*Part 5 Environmental Separation
*Part 6 Heating, Ventilating and Air-conditioning
*Part 7 Plumbing Services
*Part 8 Safety Measures at Construction and Demolition Sites
*Part 9 Housing and Small Buildings

Part 1 gives the definitions and describes how the building code is applied. Houses and certain other small buildings (less than 3 storeys high and 600&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) are considered "Part 9 Buildings" and Part 9 drives the majority of the code requirements, with references to other parts where the scope of Part 9 is exceeded. Larger buildings are considered "Part 3 buildings" and parts 1 through 8 apply. Part 3 is the largest and most complicated part of the building code. It is intended to be used by engineers and architects. Part 9 is very prescriptive and is intended to be able to be applied by [[general contractor|contractor]]s.

The building code also references hundreds of other construction documents that are legally incorporated by reference and thus part of the enforceable code. This includes many design, material testing, installation and commissioning documents that are produced by a number of private organizations. Most prominent among these are the [[Canadian Electrical Code]], Underwriters Laboratories of Canada&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ulc.ca/ Underwriters Laboratories of Canada (ULC)]&lt;/ref&gt; a subsidiary of [[Underwriters Laboratories]], documents on [[burglar alarm|fire alarm]] design, and a number of [[National Fire Protection Association]] documents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2541">The '''Newborns’ and Mothers’ Health Protection Act of 1996''' is a piece of [[legislation]] relating to the coverage of [[maternity]] by [[health insurance]] plans in the [[United States of America]]. It was signed into law on September 26, 1996 and requires plans that offer maternity coverage to pay for at least a 48-hour hospital stay following childbirth (96-hour stay in the case of a [[caesarean section]]). 

== Provisions of the Act ==
This law was effective for group health plans for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1998. 

On October 27, 1998, the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]], in conjunction with the Departments of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury]] and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services]], published interim regulations clarifying issues arising under the Newborns’ Act. The changes made by the regulations are effective for group health plans for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1999. 
 
The Act and its regulations provide that health plans and insurance issuers may not restrict a mother’s or newborn’s benefits for a hospital length of stay that is connected to childbirth to less than 48 hours following a vaginal delivery or 96 hours following a delivery by caesarean section. However, the attending medical provider (who may be a physician or nurse midwife) may decide, after consulting with the mother, to discharge the mother or newborn child earlier. The Act, and its regulations, prohibit incentives (either positive or negative) that could encourage less than the minimum protections under the Act as described above. 
 
A mother cannot be encouraged to accept less than the minimum protections available to her under the Act and an attending provider cannot be induced to discharge a mother or newborn earlier than 48 or 96 hours after delivery. The type of coverage provided by the plan (insured or self-insured) and state law will determine whether the Act applies to a mother’s or newborn’s coverage. The Act provisions always apply to coverage that is self-insured. All group health plans that provide maternity or newborn infant coverage must include a statement in their summary plan description (SPD) advising individuals of the Act's requirements.

Ouster clauses seek to exclude courts from reviewing actions and decisions of the [[executive (government)|executive branch of government]].]]
{{Administrative law}}

An '''ouster clause''' or '''privative clause''' is, in countries with [[common law]] legal systems, a clause or provision included in a piece of [[legislation]] by a [[legislature|legislative body]] to exclude [[judicial review]] of acts and decisions of the [[executive (government)|executive]] by stripping the courts of their supervisory judicial function. According to the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]], one of the important functions of the [[judiciary]] is to keep the executive in check by ensuring that its acts comply with the law, including, where applicable, the [[constitution]]. Ouster clauses prevent courts from carrying out this function, but may be justified on the ground that they preserve the powers of the executive and promote the finality of its acts and decisions.

Ouster clauses may be divided into two species&amp;nbsp;– total ouster clauses and partial ouster clauses. In the United Kingdom, the effectiveness of total ouster clauses is fairly limited. In the case of ''[[Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission|Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Committee]]'' (1968), the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held that ouster clauses cannot prevent the courts from examining an executive decision that, due to an error of law, is a nullity. Subsequent cases held that ''Anisminic'' had abolished the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law. Thus, although prior to ''Anisminic'' an ouster clause was effective in preventing judicial review where only a non-jurisdictional error of law was involved, following that case ouster clauses do not prevent courts from dealing with both jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law, except in a number of limited situations.

The [[High Court of Australia]] has held that the [[Constitution of Australia]] restricts the ability of legislatures to insulate administrative tribunals from judicial review using privative clauses. Similarly, in India ouster clauses are almost always ineffective because judicial review is regarded as part of the [[basic structure doctrine|basic structure]] of the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] that cannot be excluded. The position in Singapore is unclear. Two cases decided after ''Anisminic'' have maintained the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law, and it is not yet known whether the courts will eventually adopt the legal position in the United Kingdom. The [[Chief Justice of Singapore]], [[Chan Sek Keong]], suggested in a 2010 lecture that ouster clauses may be inconsistent with Article 93 of the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]], which vests judicial power in the courts, and may thus be void. However, he emphasized that he was not expressing a concluded view on the matter.

In contrast with total ouster clauses, courts in the United Kingdom have affirmed the validity of partial ouster clauses that specify a time period after which aggrieved persons can no longer apply to court for a remedy.

==Background==
[[File:Red and green traffic signals, Stamford Road, Singapore - 20111210.jpg|thumb|upright|Traffic signals along [[Stamford Road]], Singapore. The effectiveness of an ouster clause may depend on whether a particular jurisdiction adopts the red-light or green-light theory of [[administrative law]].]]

According to the [[A. V. Dicey|Diceyan]] model of [[separation of powers]], the executive of a state governs according to a framework of general rules in society established by the legislature, and the judiciary ensures that the executive acts within the confines of these rules through [[judicial review]].&lt;ref name="Leyland 5"&gt;{{citation|author=Peter Leyland|author2=Gordon Anthony|chapter=Introduction, Theory and History|title=Textbook on Administrative Law|edition=6th|location=Oxford; New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|pages=1–16 at 5|isbn=978-0-19-921776-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, under both [[constitutional law|constitutional]] and [[administrative law]], the courts possess supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power. When carrying out [[judicial review#Judicial review of administrative acts|judicial review of administrative action]], the court scrutinizes the legality and not the substantive merits of an act or decision made by a public authority under the three broad headings of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service|link=Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service|court=UKHL|year=1983|num=6|parallelcite=[1985] A.C. 374 at 410|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In jurisdictions which have a written constitution, the courts also [[judicial review#Judicial review of primary legislation|assess the constitutionality of legislation]], executive actions and governmental policy. Therefore, part of the role of the judiciary is to ensure that public authorities act lawfully and to serve as a check and balance on the government's power. However, the legislature may attempt to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts by the inclusion of ouster clauses in the statutes empowering public authorities to act and make decisions. These ouster clauses may be total or partial.&lt;ref name="Leyland 392"&gt;{{citation|author=Peter Leyland|author2=Gordon Anthony|chapter=Express and Implied Limits on Judicial Review: Ouster and Time Limit Clauses, the Prerogative Power, Public Interest Immunity|url=http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/extracts/9780199217762_leyland.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GVZ0nNUg|archivedate=10 May 2013|title=Textbook on Administrative Law|edition=6th|location=Oxford; New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|pages=392–437 at 392|isbn=978-0-19-921776-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are some examples of ouster clauses:
*'''Singapore'''. Section 47 of the Industrial Relations Act:&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Industrial Relations Act|cap=136|ed=2004}} (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; "(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, an award shall be final and conclusive. (2) No award or decision or order of a Court or the President or a referee shall be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called in question in any court and shall not be subject to any Quashing Order, Prohibiting Order, Mandatory Order or injunction in any court on any account."
*'''United Kingdom'''. Section 4(4) of the Foreign Compensation Act:&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Compensation Act 1950 ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/14/12/contents 1950 c. 12], UK). Section 4(4) has since been [[repeal]]ed.&lt;/ref&gt; "The determination by the Commission of any application made to them under this Act shall not be called into question in any court of law."

If an ouster clause achieves its desired effect in preventing the courts from exercising judicial review, it will serve as a clear signal to the decision-maker that it may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage.&lt;ref name="Leyland 392"/&gt; However, ouster clauses have traditionally been viewed with suspicion by the courts.&lt;ref name="Gilmore"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Medical Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Gilmore|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1957|num=1|parallelcite=[1957] 1 Q.B. 574|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 19th-century ''[[laissez-faire]]'' theory championed by [[A. V. Dicey]], which [[Carol Harlow]] and Richard Rawlings termed as the "red-light approach" in their 1984 book ''Law and Administration'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Carol Harlow|author2=Richard Rawlings|title=Law and Administration|location=London|publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0-297-78239-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; there should be a deep-rooted suspicion of governmental power and a desire to minimize the encroachment of the state on the rights of the individuals.&lt;ref name="Leyland 5"/&gt; Therefore, the executive, which is envisaged as capable of arbitrary encroachment on the rights of individual citizens, is subjected to political control by Parliament and to legal control by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Harlow &amp; Rawlings, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other end of the spectrum, there is the green-light approach derived from the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] school of thought associated with legal philosophers such as [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. The green-light approach regards state involvement as an effective means to facilitate the delivery of communitarian goals.&lt;ref&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, "Introduction, Theory and History", p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, ouster clauses are regarded as useful devices to keep a conservatively inclined judiciary at bay. One such communitarian goal achieved by ouster clauses is that it results in consistency and finality in the implementation of policy considerations by encouraging specialist bodies to act as adjudicators in certain areas of administration.&lt;ref name="Leyland 393"&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, "Express and Implied Limits on Judicial Review", p.&amp;nbsp;393.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Total ouster clauses==
===In the United Kingdom===
Total ouster clauses, also known as finality clauses, seek to completely exclude the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts. In the United Kingdom, before the seminal decision of ''[[Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission|Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission]]'' (1968),&lt;ref name="Anisminic"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Committee|link=Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission|court=UKHL|year=1968|num=6|parallelcite=[1969] 2 A.C. 147|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the law drew a distinction between situations where the public body was acting within the powers conferred on it by law but committed an error of law (a "non-jurisdictional error of law"), and situations where the commission of the error of law meant that the public body did not in fact have power to act (a "jurisdictional error of law"). In the former situation, a total ouster clause precluded the courts from exercising their supervisory function and issuing any [[prerogative writ|prerogative orders]] to quash the erroneous action. The courts could only step in if the error of law affected the jurisdiction of the public body to act, for example, if the public body erroneously interpreted the scope of the powers conferred upon it, and thus made a decision which it had no power to make.&lt;ref name="Leyland 393"/&gt;

In ''R. v. Medical Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Gilmore'' (1957),&lt;ref name="Gilmore"/&gt; the legality of the total ouster clause in section 36(3) of the [[National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946]]&lt;ref&gt;[[National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946]] (9 &amp; 10 Geo. VI, c. 62, UK).&lt;/ref&gt; was doubted by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]], which issued a ''[[certiorari]]'' against the Medical Appeal Tribunal for an error of law on the face of the record. [[Lord Justice of Appeal]] [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Alfred Denning]] stated that the words "any decision of a claim or question ... shall be final" only excluded an appeal but not judicial review:&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Gilmore'', p. 583.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I find it very well settled that the remedy by ''certiorari'' is never to be taken away by any statute except by the most clear and explicit words. The word "final" is not enough. That only means "without appeal." It does not mean "without recourse to ''certiorari''." It makes the decision final on the facts, but not final on the law. Notwithstanding that the decision is by a statute made "final," ''certiorari'' can still issue for excess of jurisdiction or for error of law on the face of the record.}}

In ''Anisminic'', the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] effectively held that any error of law made by a public body will render its decision a nullity, and an ouster clause does not oust the courts' jurisdiction in judicial review unless it clearly states so.&lt;ref&gt;''Anisminic'', p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[list of tribunals in the United Kingdom#Foreign Compensation Commission|Foreign Compensation Commission]] had misinterpreted certain [[delegated legislation|subsidiary legislation]], with the effect that almost all claims for foreign compensation would be defeated. Their Lordships held that this misconstruction of the legislation rendered the decision ''[[ultra vires]]'', and since the Parliament could not have intended for the ouster clause to protect an ''ultra vires'' determination, judicial review was not precluded. Though ''Anisminic'' did not expressly abolish the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law, in ''R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page'' (1992)&lt;ref name=Page&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page|court=UKHL|year=1992|num=12|parallelcite=[1993] A.C. 682|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords noted that:&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Page'', p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[T]he decision in [''Anisminic''] rendered obsolete the distinction between errors of law on the face of the record and other errors of law by extending the doctrine of ''ultra vires''. Thenceforward it was to be taken that Parliament had only conferred the decision-making power on the basis that it was to be exercised on the correct legal basis: a misdirection in law in making the decision therefore rendered the decision ultra vires.}}

Thus, in [[English law]] all errors of law are now to be considered as jurisdictional and ''ultra vires'' in a broad sense of the term. This implies that ouster clauses should not be effective against any error of law. The ''Anisminic'' principle was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] in ''R. (on the application of Cart) v. Upper Tribunal'' (2011)&lt;ref name=Cart&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. (on the application of Cart) v. Upper Tribunal|court=UKSC|year=2011|num=28|parallelcite=[2012] 1 A.C. 663|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so that the [[rule of law]] is promoted, among other reasons. Since it is practically immaterial to the victim of an error of law whether it is a jurisdictional error or otherwise, it would be manifestly unjust if judicial review was precluded when a non-jurisdictional error was egregious and obvious, but allowed for a small jurisdictional error.&lt;ref&gt;''Cart'', p. 142, para. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exceptions====
Though the scope of judicial review has been expanded considerably following ''Anisminic'', there are still a number of exceptions where total ouster clauses preclude courts from exercising their supervisory function in a judicial review.

=====Courts of law=====
The ''Anisminic'' principle applies only to public bodies exercising executive functions, over which the courts can exercise their supervisory role and have the power to decide [[question of law|questions of law]]. However, superior courts do not have any supervisory function in relation to inferior courts of law, because Parliament is deemed to have intended that such courts are to be final arbiters of questions of law. Whether the decision of a court of law is final and not subject to judicial review depends on a construction of the statute defining the jurisdiction and powers of the court. In ''Re Racal Communications Ltd.'' (1980),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Re Racal Communications Ltd.|court=UKHL|year=1980|num=5|parallelcite=[1981] A.C. 374|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] noted that if a statute provides that the court's decision should be final and conclusive, the "subtle distinctions formerly drawn between errors of law which go to jurisdiction and errors of law which do not" survive. Hence, any non-jurisdictional errors of law made by a court can be only corrected by appeal if the statute provides for it.&lt;ref&gt;''Racal'', pp. 382–383.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Internal regulations=====
It was held in ''ex parte Page''&lt;ref name="Page"/&gt; that if a decision-maker is applying some "domestic law" or internal regulations instead of a general law of the land, then an ouster clause is effective in excluding judicial review unless the decision-maker acts outside his or her jurisdiction (that is, he or she has no power to enter into the adjudication of the dispute), abuses power, or acts in breach of [[natural justice]]. In the case, the House of Lords held that a university [[visitor]] (overseer) appointed by the founder of a charitable institution to regulate its internal affairs has exclusive jurisdiction to decide disputes arising under the domestic law of the university that has been laid down by the founder in the constitutive documents establishing the university.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Page'', p. 702.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Comprehensive tribunal system to correct errors of law=====
[[File:Field House, London, UK - 20130627-06.JPG|thumb|Field House at 15 Bream's Buildings, London, where the [[Upper Tribunal]] is based. In a 2011 judgment, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]] held that not all decisions of the Upper Tribunal are subject to judicial review.]]

Another exception can be found in the ''Cart''&lt;ref name=Cart/&gt; judgment. [[John Dyson, Lord Dyson|Lord Dyson]] emphasized that "the scope of judicial review should be no more (as well as no less) than is proportionate and necessary for the maintaining of the rule of law".&lt;ref&gt;''Cart'', p. 145, para. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; On the facts of the case, he found it was neither proportionate nor necessary for the maintenance of the rule of law to require unrestricted judicial review. By enacting the [[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]] ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/15/contents 2007 c. 15], UK).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] had rationalized the system of administrative tribunals and had created the [[Upper Tribunal]] to hear appeals from lower tribunals, thus avoiding the ordinary courts from being overwhelmed by judicial review applications. As the system of tribunals provided ample opportunity for the correction of errors of law, this substantive policy reason precluded the need for all decisions of the Upper Tribunal to be subject to judicial review. Thus, judicial review would only be permitted from an Upper Tribunal decision if it would "raise some important point of principle or practice" or there was "some other compelling reason".&lt;ref&gt;''Cart'', pp. 145–148, paras. 123–133 (the quoted phrases are from p. 147, para. 129).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other jurisdictions===
As the United Kingdom does not have a written [[constitution]] and observes the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty|parliamentary supremacy]], the courts there could not render an ouster clause ineffective due to inconsistency with a constitutional provision, but instead excluded its application in some cases under the [[common law]] doctrine of the rule of law. However, in jurisdictions with a written constitution and hence constitutional supremacy, the courts can exclude the application of ouster clauses by pronouncing that the provision is unconstitutional and thus null and void.

====Australia====
The [[High Court of Australia]] has shown resistance to privative clauses, holding that the ability of legislatures to insulate administrative tribunals from judicial review by means of such clauses is restricted by the [[Constitution of Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Richard Walter Pty. Ltd.|court=HCA|year=1995|num=23|parallelcite=(1995) 183 C.L.R. 168 at 194|courtname=auto}}; {{cite AustLII|litigants=Re Refugee Review Tribunal, ex parte Aala|court=HCA|year=2000|num=57|parallelcite=(2000) 204 C.L.R. 82|courtname=H.C.|juris=Australia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly section&amp;nbsp;75(v) which states: "In all matters&amp;nbsp;... in which a writ of [[Mandamus]] or [[writ of prohibition|prohibition]] or an [[injunction]] is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth&amp;nbsp;... the High Court shall have [[original jurisdiction]]." There is a further presumption in construing privative clauses that Parliament did not intend to limit access to the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Hockey. v. Yellend|court=HCA|year=1984|num=72|parallelcite=(1984) 157 C.L.R. 124|courtname=H.C.|juris=Australia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the High Court decision ''R. v. Hickman, ex parte Fox'' (1945),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=R. v. Hickman, ex parte Fox|court=HCA|year=1945|num=53|parallelcite=(1945) 70 C.L.R. 598|courtname=H.C.|juris=Australia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Owen Dixon]] said:&lt;ref name="Fox 615"&gt;''Ex parte Fox'', p. 615.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|They [privative clauses] are not interpreted as meaning to set at large the courts or other judicial bodies to whose decision they relate. Such a clause is interpreted as meaning that no decision which is in fact given by the body concerned shall be invalidated on the ground that it has not conformed to the requirements governing its proceedings or the exercise of its authority or has not confined its acts within the limits laid down by the instrument giving it authority, provided always that its decision is a bona fide attempt to exercise its power, that it relates to the subject matter of the legislation, and that it is reasonably capable of reference to the power given to the body.}}

Thus, a privative clause does not prevent the High Court from exercising judicial review if an authority has failed to exercise power in a ''bona fide'' manner, or if the action taken or decision made is irrelevant to the subject manner of the legislation or does not come within the power conferred on the authority.&lt;ref name="Fox 615"/&gt; While a statutory clause will be inconsistent with section&amp;nbsp;75(v) if it purports to prevent the Court from determining whether a Commonwealth officer has engaged "in unlawful or unauthorized conduct" or acted "on the basis that an invalid decision is valid and enforceable",&lt;ref name="Richard Walter 6"&gt;''Richard Walter Pty. Ltd.'', para.&amp;nbsp;6 (Justices [[William Deane]] and [[Mary Gaudron]]).&lt;/ref&gt; a clause will not be unconstitutional if it has the effect of altering the procedural or substantive law that the Court must apply&lt;ref name="Richard Walter 6"/&gt; to ensure that "the impugned decision or conduct is in fact valid or lawful".&lt;ref&gt;''Richard Walter Pty. Ltd.'', para.&amp;nbsp;3 (Justices Deane and Gaudron).&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
[[File:Supreme Court of India - 200705 (edited).jpg|thumb|The [[Supreme Court of India]] held in a 1980 case that [[judicial review]] is part of the [[basic structure doctrine|basic structure]] of the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]]]]

India embraces the [[basic structure doctrine]], which states that the basic structure or features of the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] may not be amended. Judicial review has been regarded as a basic feature since the case of ''[[Minerva Mills v. Union of India]]'' (1980),&lt;ref name="Minerva"&gt;{{cite LIIofIndia|litigants=Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India|link=Minerva Mills v. Union of India|court=INSC|year=1980|num=141|parallelcite=A.I.R. 1980 S.C. 1789, 1981 (1) S.C.R. 206|courtname=auto}}, affirmed by {{cite LIIofIndia|litigants=S. P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India|court=INSC|year=1986|num=261|parallelcite=A.I.R. 1987 S.C. 386 at 441|courtname=S.C.|juris=India}}, and {{cite LIIofIndia|litigants=|link=S. R. Bommai v. Union of India|court=INSC|year=1994|num=173|parallelcite=A.I.R. 1994 S.C. 1918 at paras. 200 and 255|courtname=S.C.|juris=India}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] expressing the following view:&lt;ref&gt;''Minerva Mills'', 1981 (1) S.C.R. at p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The power of the judicial review is an integral part of our constitutional system and without it, there will be no Government of Laws and the rule of law would become a teasing illusion and a promise of unreality. If there is one feature of our Constitution which, more than any other, is basic and fundamental to the maintenance of democracy and the rule of law, it is the power of judicial review and it is unquestionably a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.}}

The Parliament's "power to destroy is not a power to amend",&lt;ref&gt;''Minerva Mills'', 1981 (1) S.C.R. at p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; and hence the power of judicial review may not be abrogated either by the ordinary process of legislation or through the procedure of constitutional amendment. Therefore, it might be argued that ouster clauses, which are intended to make decisions by public authorities and other decision-makers final and unchallengeable before the courts, should be held void and ineffective as they deprive the aggrieved party of an avenue of seeking judicial review. However, it was held in ''A. B. C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. v. A. P. Agencies, Salem'' (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LIIofIndia|litigants=A. B. C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. v. A. P. Agencies, Salem|court=INSC|year=1989|num=85|parallelcite=A.I.R. 1989 S.C. 1239, 1989 (2) S.C.R. 1|courtname=S.C.|juris=India}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that where there are two or more courts with jurisdiction over a matter, and an ouster clause merely limits the jurisdiction to one particular court, the ouster clause is valid as the aggrieved party is still left with an avenue to proceed with his or her claim:&lt;ref&gt;''A. B. C. Laminart'', 1989 (2) S.C.R. at p. 12. See also {{citation|author=Rosy Kumar|title=A Question of Jurisdiction|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jurisdiction-issue-consumer-protection-and-trade-practices/1/165951.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230041354/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/jurisdiction-issue-consumer-protection-and-trade-practices/1/165951.html|archivedate=30 December 2011|magazine=[[India Today]]|date=26 December 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[W]here such an ouster clause occurs, it is pertinent to see whether there is ouster of jurisdiction of other Courts. When the clause is clear, unambiguous and specific accepted notions of contract would bind the parties and unless the absence of [[meeting of the minds|ad idem]] can be shown, the other Courts should avoid exercising jurisdiction. As regards construction of the ouster clause when words like 'alone', 'only', 'exclusive' and the like have been used there may be no difficulty. ... In such a case mention of one thing may imply exclusion of another.}}

====Singapore====
{{Main|Exclusion of judicial review in Singapore law}}
[[File:Old and New Supreme Courts.jpg|thumb|The new and old [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] buildings in Singapore. The effectiveness of ouster clauses in this jurisdiction is still unclear.]]

In Singapore, the state of the law regarding the effectiveness of ouster clauses is still unclear. Whereas in the United Kingdom the courts have abolished the distinction between non-jurisdictional and jurisdictional errors of law and affirmed that in general ouster clauses are ineffective against errors of law, Singapore cases seem to adopt the traditional pre-''Anisminic'' approach. The distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law and the effectiveness of ouster clauses against non-jurisdictional errors of law is exemplified by the cases of ''Re Application by Yee Yut Ee'' (1978),&lt;ref&gt;''Re Application by Yee Yut Ee'' [1977–1978] S.L.R.(R.) [''Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)''] 490, [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Stansfield Business International Pte. Ltd. v. Minister for Manpower'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;''Stansfield Business International Pte. Ltd. v. Minister of Manpower'' [1999] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 866, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Yee Yut Ee'', the High Court neither expressly rejected nor affirmed the abolition of the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law in ''Anisminic'' and its effect on the effectiveness of ouster clauses. Instead, the Court cited UK authorities holding that ouster clauses are ineffective when there has been an absence of jurisdiction&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Hurst, ex parte Smith'' [1960] 2 Q.B. 133 at 142, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] (England and Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; or an excess of jurisdiction on the part of the decision-maker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Medical Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Gilmore|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1957|num=1|parallelcite=[1957] 1 Q.B. 574 at 586|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was the legal position prior to ''Anisminic''.&lt;ref&gt;''Yee Yut Ee'', p. 495, para. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Court did refer to ''Anisminic'', it did so only to observe that the House of Lords had held the ouster clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could not be considered a real determination and had no effect at all. Ultimately, the Court quashed the order made by the Industrial Arbitration Court because it contained an error of law which had caused that court to exceed its jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;''Yee Yut Ee'', pp. 496–497, paras. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Stansfield'', an employee of the plaintiff alleged that he had been [[unfair dismissal|dismissed from his employment without just cause]], and made representations to the [[Ministry of Manpower (Singapore)|Minister of Manpower]] to be reinstated. The Minister agreed with the employee and recommended that the plaintiff provide him with monetary compensation. Even though section&amp;nbsp;14(5) of the Employment Act&lt;ref&gt;Employment Act (Cap. 91, 1996 Rev. Ed.), now {{Singapore legislation|cap=91|ed=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that any decision of the Minister is "final and conclusive, and shall not be challenged in any court of law", the plaintiff challenged the decision by applying to the High Court for judicial review by way of ''certiorari''.&lt;ref&gt;''Stansfield'', p. 873, paras. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of its judgment, the Court cited the following passage from ''South East Asia Fire Bricks Sdn. Bhd. v. Non-Metallic Mineral Products Manufacturing Employees Union'' (1980):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=South East Asia Fire Bricks Sdn. Bhd. v. Non-Metallic Mineral Products Manufacturing Employees Union|court=UKPC|year=1980|num=21|format=1|parallelcite=[1981] A.C. 363 at 370|courtname=auto|juris=Malaysia}}, cited in ''Stansfield'', p. 874, para. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[W]hen words in a statute oust the power of the High Court to review decisions of an inferior tribunal by ''certiorari'', they must be construed strictly... they will not have the effect of ousting that power if the inferior tribunal has acted without jurisdiction or "if it has done or failed to do something in the course of the inquiry which is of such a nature that its decision is a nullity": ''per'' Lord Reid at p.&amp;nbsp;171 [of ''Anisminic'']. But if the inferior tribunal has merely made an error of law which does not affect its jurisdiction, and if its decision is not a nullity for some reason such as breach of the rules of natural justice, then the ouster will be effective.}}

It is presently not known whether Singapore courts will eventually adopt the current legal position in the United Kingdom. [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] [[Chan Sek Keong]] observed during a 2010 lecture that what the High Court said about ''Anisminic'' in ''Stansfield'' was ''[[obiter dictum|obiter dicta]]'' because the actual decision was "based on a breach of natural justice and not the doctrine of error of law".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Chan Sek Keong|authorlink=Chan Sek Keong|title=Judicial Review – From Angst to Empathy: A Lecture to Singapore Management University Second Year Law Students|url=http://www.sal.org.sg/digitallibrary/Lists/SAL%20Journal/Attachments/516/%282010%29%2022%20SAcLJ%20469-489_Chan%20CJ.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63bXAGCt7|archivedate=1 December 2011|journal=Singapore Academy of Law Journal|date=September 2010|volume=22|pages=469–489 at 476, para. 17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court had concluded that the ouster clause was ineffective in preventing judicial review of the Minister's decision, as the plaintiff had not been given a fair opportunity to present its case with knowledge of the opponent's allegations.&lt;ref&gt;''Stansfield'', pp. 875–877, paras. 26–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice Chan also advanced an academic argument that ouster clauses might be viewed as being contrary to Article 93 of the [[Constitution of Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|ed=1985|rep=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which vests the judicial power of Singapore in the courts, because ouster clauses strip the [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] of its supervisory jurisdiction over inferior tribunals and other public authorities. If the argument that the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts cannot be ousted holds, there is no need to distinguish between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law. However, he made it clear that he was not expressing an opinion on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, p. 477, para. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Indian example, it might be argued that judicial review is a basic feature of the Constitution and cannot be removed through the use of ouster clauses. However, the basic features doctrine was rejected by the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] in ''[[Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs]]'' (1989).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs#High Court judgment|Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs]]'' [1989] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 461 at 479, para. 47, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; On appeal, the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] found it unnecessary to rule on whether the position taken by the High Court is correct or not.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs#Court of Appeal judgment|Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs]]'' [1990] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 347 at 367–368, para. 44, [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial ouster clauses==
Unlike a total ouster clause which seeks to preclude judicial review entirely, a partial ouster clause specifies a restricted period of time after which no remedy will be available. However, if the issue of whether a public authority has acted in [[bad faith]] arises, the authority's act or decision is not immune to judicial review notwithstanding the lapse of time.&lt;ref&gt;Leyland &amp; Anthony, "Express and Implied Limits on Judicial Review", pp.&amp;nbsp;399–402.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United Kingdom===
In ''Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council'' (1956),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council|court=UKHL|year=1956|num=2|parallelcite=[1956] A.C. 736|courtname=H.L.|juris=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Lords concluded by a majority that it could not impugn a partial ouster clause because, according to [[Gavin Simonds, 1st Viscount Simonds|Viscount Simonds]], "plain words must be given their plain meaning", regardless of an allegation of fraud on the part of the public authority.&lt;ref&gt;''Smith'', p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt; The consequences of such a narrow approach were recognized in the [[dissenting opinion|dissenting judgement]] by [[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]], in which he doubted whether an ouster clause could protect an order that had been obtained by corrupt or fraudulent means from being questioned in court. He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;''Smith'', p. 765.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In every class of case that I can think of the courts have always held that general words are not to be read as enabling a deliberate wrongdoer to take advantage of his own dishonesty.}}

The decision in ''Anisminic'', which held that total ouster clauses do not safeguard decisions affected by errors of law from judicial review, poses a challenge to the judgment in ''Smith'', but the latter was affirmed by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in ''R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Ostler'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Ostler|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1976|num=6|parallelcite=[1977] Q.B. 122|courtname=C.A.|juris=England and Wales}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held that a distinction could be drawn between a total ouster clause and a partial ouster such as the one in question, which gave the applicants six weeks to challenge the decision. Lord Denning, the [[Master of the Rolls]], explained that the rationale for upholding time limit clauses is that it is in the public interest to promote certainty of the executive's actions. If the courts were to allow plaintiffs to come to them for remedies long after the time limit for doing so has expired, the acts or decisions of authorities would be held up or delayed.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Ostler'', pp. 128–130 and 133.&lt;/ref&gt; As Lord Justice of Appeal Michael Mann explained in ''R. v. Cornwall County Council, ex parte Huntington'' (1992):&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Cornwall County Council, ex parte Huntington'' [1992] 3 All E.R. 566 at 575, [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] (England and Wales), cited with approval by Lord Justice of Appeal [[Simon Brown, Baron Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood|Simon Brown]] in ''R. v. Cornwall County Council, ex parte Huntington'' [1994] 1 All E.R. 694 at 698, C.A. (England and Wales).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The intention of Parliament when it uses an ''Anisminic'' clause is that questions as to validity are not excluded. When paragraphs such as those considered in ''ex p. Ostler'' are used, then the legislative intention is that questions as to invalidity may be raised on the specified grounds in the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner, but that otherwise the jurisdiction of the court is excluded in the interests of certainty.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14263">'''Price controls''' are governmental restrictions on the prices that can be charged for goods and services in a market. The intent behind implementing such controls can stem from the desire to maintain affordability of goods even  during shortages, and to slow inflation, or, alternatively, to ensure a minimum income for providers of certain goods or a [[minimum wage]]. There are two primary forms of price control, a [[price ceiling]], the maximum price that can be charged, and a [[price floor]], the minimum price that can be charged.

Historically, price controls have often been imposed as part of a larger [[incomes policy]] package also employing [[wage]] controls and other regulatory elements.

Although price controls are sometimes used by governments, economists usually agree that price controls don't accomplish what they are intended to do and are generally to be avoided.&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt; For example, nearly three-quarters of economists surveyed disagreed with the statement, "Wage-price controls are a useful policy option in the control of inflation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Alston|first1=Richard M.|last2=Kearl|first2=J.R.|last3=Vaughan|first3=Michael B.|publisher=[[American Economic Review]]|volume=82|issue=2|pages=203–209|url=http://www.weber.edu/wsuimages/AcademicAffairs/ProvostItems/global.pdf|title=Is There a Consensus Among Economists in the 1990's?|date=May 1992|accessdate=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]] tried to [[Edict on Maximum Prices|set maximum prices]] for all commodities in the late 3rd century AD but with little success.

In early 14th century, the [[Delhi Sultanate]] ruler [[Alauddin Khalji]] instituted [[market reforms of Alauddin Khalji|several market reforms]], which included price-fixing for a wide range of goods, including grains, cloth, slaves and animals. However, a few months after his death, these measures were revoked by his son [[Qutb ud din Mubarak Shah|Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Banarsi Prasad Saksena |author-link=Banarsi Prasad Saksena |chapter=The Khaljis: Alauddin Khalji |editor=Mohammad Habib and Khaliq Ahmad Nizami |title=A Comprehensive History of India: The Delhi Sultanat (A.D. 1206-1526) |volume=5 |edition=Second |year=1992 |orig-year=1970 |publisher=The Indian History Congress / People's Publishing House |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_9cmAQAAMAAJ |oclc=31870180 |page=429 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], [[General maximum|the Law of the Maximum]] set price limits on the sale of food and other staples.

Governments in [[planned economy|planned economies]] typically control prices on most or all goods but have not sustained high economic performance and have been almost entirely replaced by [[mixed economies]].

Price controls have also been used in modern times in less-planned economies, such as [[rent control]].&lt;ref name="concise"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Rockoff |first1=Hugh |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor=[[David R.

===Postwar===
[[Incomes policy|Wage controls]] have been tried in many countries to reduce [[inflation]], seldom successfully.  Modern neoclassical economic theory supports the alternative remedy of reducing the money supply and proposes that [[monetary inflation]] is caused by too much [[money creation]] by the [[central bank]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

====United Kingdom====
The [[National Board for Prices and Incomes]] was created by the government of [[Harold Wilson]] in 1965 in an attempt to solve the problem of inflation in the British economy by managing wages and prices. The [[Prices and Incomes Act 1966]] c. 33 affected UK labour law, regarding wage levels and price policies. It allowed the government to begin a process to scrutinise rising levels of wages (then around 8% per year) by initiating reports and inquiries and ultimately giving orders for a standstill. The objective was to control inflation. It proved unpopular after the 1960s.

====United States====
In the United States, price controls have been enacted several times: During World War I and World War II, and by President Nixon.  The first time price controls were enacted nationally was in 1906 as a part of the [[Hepburn Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=44McCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT92 Theodore the Great: Conservative Crusader], p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, States have sometimes chosen to implement their own control policies.

In the 1860s, several midwestern states of the United States, namely Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois, enacted a series of laws called the [[Granger Laws]], primarily to regulate rising fare prices of railroad and grain elevator companies.

[[California]] controls the prices of [[electricity]] within the state, which conservative economist [[Thomas Sowell]] blames for the occasional electricity shortages the state experiences.&lt;ref name="sowell"&gt;

| accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] stepped in and set [[price ceiling|price caps]] for each [[megawatt]] of power bought after lifting the caps to avoid [[rolling blackout]]s six months previously.&lt;ref name="sfgate"/&gt;

The state of [[Hawaii]] briefly introduced a cap on the wholesale price of [[gasoline]] (the [[Gas Cap Law]]) in an effort to fight "[[price gouging]]" in that state in 2005. Because it was widely seen as too soft and ineffective, it was repealed shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt; the well of natal&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The primary criticism leveled against price controls is that by keeping prices artificially low, demand is increased to the point where supply can not keep up, leading to shortages in the price-controlled product.&lt;ref name="Wessels"&gt;Walter J. Wessels, ''Economics'' (2000), pp. 232–33.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Lactantius]] wrote that [[Diocletian]] "by various taxes he had made all things exceedingly expensive, attempted by a law to limit their prices. Then much blood [of merchants] was shed for trifles, men were afraid to offer anything for sale, and the scarcity became more excessive and grievous than ever. Until, in the end, the [price limit] law, after having proved destructive to many people, was from mere necessity abolished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf07.iii.v.vii.html|title=On the Deaths of the Persecutors|author=[[Lactantius]]|work=ca. 300|chapter=CHAP. VII. |publisher=Calvin College |edition=Christian Classics Ethereal Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with Diocletian's [[Edict on Maximum Prices]], shortages lead to [[black market]]s where prices for the same good exceed those of an uncontrolled market.&lt;ref name="Wessels"/&gt; Furthermore, once controls are removed, prices will immediately increase, which can temporarily shock the economic system.&lt;ref name="Wessels"/&gt;

A classic example of how price controls cause shortages was during the [[1973 world oil market chronology|Arab oil embargo between October 19, 1973 and March 17, 1974]]. Long lines of cars and trucks quickly appeared at retail gas stations in the U.S. and some stations closed because of a shortage of fuel at the low price set by the [[U.S. Cost of Living Council]]. The fixed price was below what the market would otherwise bear and, as a result, the inventory disappeared. It made no difference whether prices were voluntarily or involuntarily posted below the market clearing price. Scarcity resulted in either case. Price controls fail to achieve their proximate aim, which is to reduce prices paid by retail consumers, but such controls do manage to reduce supply.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor and Van Doren, pp. 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Sowell, ''Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One'' (2008), pp. 7–9, 112–13, {{ISBN|0-465-00345-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel prize]] winner [[Milton Friedman]] said "We economists don't know much, but we do know how to create a shortage. If you want to create a shortage of tomatoes, for example, just pass a law that retailers can't sell tomatoes for more than two cents per pound. Instantly you'll have a tomato shortage. It's the same with oil or gas."&lt;ref&gt;"Controls blamed for U.S. energy woes", ''Los Angeles Times'', February 13, 1977, Milton Friedman press conference in Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Secretary of the Treasury]], [[George Shultz]], enacting Nixon's "New Economic Policy," lifted price controls that had begun in 1971 (part of the [[Nixon Shock]]). This lifting of price controls resulted in a rapid increase in prices. Price freezes were re-established five months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/about/history/Pages/gpschultz.aspx |title=George P. Shultz (1972–1974) |publisher=Treasury.gov |date=2010-11-20 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Stagflation]] was eventually ended in the United States when the Federal Reserve under chairman [[Paul Volcker]] raised interest rates to unusually high levels.  This successfully ended high inflation but caused a recession that ended in the early 1980s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4518">The '''Proposed British Bill of Rights''' is a proposal of the [[Second Cameron ministry|Conservative Government]], included in their [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 election]] manifesto, to replace the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] with a new piece of primary legislation. 

==Background==
Prior to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], Conservative [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|party leader]] [[David Cameron]] proposed replacing the Human Rights Act with a new "British Bill of Rights". After forming a [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition]] with the Liberal Democrats, these plans were shelved and reinstated only after the Conservative party won an overall majority in the 2015 general election. Prime Minister David Cameron then vowed to put right what he termed the "complete mess" of Britain's human rights laws, on the 800th anniversary of the passage of the [[Magna Carta]] by the [[Kingdom of England]], one of the predecessor states to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33134338|title=David Cameron: I'll fix human rights 'mess'|author=|date=|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions have arisen between those on the [[Right-wing politics|political right]] in the UK, and the [[European Court of Human Rights]], over issues such as prisoner voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11645432/A-British-Bill-of-Rights-should-let-some-prisoners-vote.html|title=Rupert Myers: A British Bill of Rights should let some prisoners vote|work=The Telegraph|first=Rupert|last=Myers|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from the Human Rights Act==
Specific details on the specific legislation at this point are unknown, due to sparse information being published as of yet, however, some proposed differences between current legislation and a "British Bill of Rights", have already been made apparent, due to the way in which the [[Westminster system]] operates.

Currently, in order to change the text of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], there must be broad to unanimous agreement between [[Member states of the Council of Europe|member states]] of the [[Council of Europe]]. With a "British Bill of Rights", however, rights would be set forth by the UK parliament or by another body directly on its behalf, operating under the principle of [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary sovereignty]]. The ability to alter what constitutes a "right" would thus ultimately rest with the current parliament of the time.

As a result of this difference, the European Convention on Human Rights and the case law of the European Court of Human Rights would no longer be directly enforceable before domestic courts. However, the UK would remain bound under international law by the Convention.

Moreover, the Convention provides that its provisions are minimum standards, that a member party can enact laws granting rights.   Thus, a British Bill of Rights must reflect all the provisions of the ECHR.  Ultimately, any person who had exhausted domestic remedy could refer their case to the European Court which has obtained before and since the enactment of the HRA 1998.   

The proposals for the Bill of Rights appear not to include denunciation of the ECHR, only repeal of the HRA 1998 which incorporated c1-12 and 14 of the ECHR.   This would mean that, taking the previous paragraph into account, people in the UK would access their basic ECHR rights via the proposed Bill and the courts' interpretation of the Bill and its relationship to the ECHR.    Denunciation would not free the UK from the provisions of the ECHR in that any matter which occurred prior to the date of denunciation would remain within the jurisdiction of the Court of the ECHR as provided by the Convention.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3750">California voters passed '''Proposition 103''' on [[United States presidential election, 1988|November 8, 1988]]. It in effect made insurance companies require "prior approval" from the [[California Department of Insurance]] before implementing property and casualty insurance rates. It passed with 51% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt; Ralph Nader (2004). In Pursuit of Justice: Collected Writings 2000-2003. Seven Stories Press. pp. 240–. {{ISBN|978-1-58322-629-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure expanded the Department's responsibility for enforcement to include: [[property insurance]], [[automobile insurance]], [[life insurance]] and other types of casualty coverage. Proposition 103 made the [[California Insurance Commissioner]] an [[elected official|elected position]] (previously being a governor-appointed position).&lt;ref&gt;Fredrick C. Harris; Robert C. Lieberman (30 June 2013). Beyond Discrimination: Racial Inequality in a Post-Racist Era. Russell Sage Foundation. pp. 280–. {{ISBN|978-1-61044-817-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballot measure required insurers "roll back" their rates 20 percent. Proposition 103 devised a process enabling consumer participation in the setting of insurance rates, and allowed consumer "intervenors" witness fees and expenses in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;J. David Cummins (23 June 2004). Deregulating Property-Liability Insurance: Restoring Competition and Increasing Market Efficiency. Brookings Institution Press. pp. 196–. {{ISBN|978-0-8157-9841-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurance regulation==
Insurance types regulated by Proposition 103 are: Personal automobile, dwelling fire, earthquake, homeowners, inland marine, and umbrella; Commercial aircraft, automobile, boiler and machinery, burglary and theft, business owners, earthquake, farm owners, some fidelity, fire, glass, inland marine, medical malpractice, miscellaneous, multi-peril, other liability, professional liability, special multi-peril, umbrella, and coverage under the [[Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dergler |first1=Jon |title=Insurers Question California Commissioner’s Authority to Make Comp Writers Report Federal Tax Savings |url=https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2018/07/02/494057.htm |website=Insurance Journal |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the California Insurance Commissioner, Proposition 103 "has saved consumers billions" since being implemented, specifically a $4.29 billion per year dividend. It also claims "alifornians spent 0.3% less on auto insurance in 2010 than they spent in 1989, while the nation spent 43.3% more".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Information Sheet: Proposition 103 Intervenor Process |url=http://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/150-other-prog/01-intervenor/info.cfm |website=insurance.ca.gov |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Daniels |first1=Jeff |title=Why California's big fire losses this year won't mean massive insurance rate hikes in 2018 |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/07/californias-big-fire-losses-in-2017-wont-mean-huge-insurance-hikes-in-2018.html |website=CNBC |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intervenors==
Investigatory and regulatory hearings are open to intervenors. Members of the public or organizations can observe or may attend the hearing and request to be heard, submit written comments or present live testimony. Attorney fees can be reimbursed when written comments are submitted that "make a substantial contribution within the time frame in the notice".&lt;ref&gt;Impact Analysis of Weighting Auto Rating Factors to Comply with Proposition 103.

'''Reality Check Network''' was a [[diskmag]] [[warez]] magazine that existed from November 18, 1995 to Summer 1997 with two breaks in Spring 1996 and Winter 1996/1997.

With origins as a promotional magazine for the [[Legacy (warez)|Legacy]] group, it evolved into a general magazine describing various aspects of the [[warez scene]]. It contained interviews with key group leaders and described gossip and fights in the warez world. They would list each period's various releases, [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] and [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] courier MB totals, and up-to-date [[.nfo|NFO]] files for each group. This was during a period when private Internet accounts were becoming widespread in the United States and increasingly in [[Europe]] and the Internet-based warez scene was expanding rapidly. They also had an open [[IRC]] channel #rcn where people would gossip about the activities of various groups under the watch of the magazine's chief editor Rebel Chicken.

Its front-end and graphical design were considered excellent and based on efficient assembly code. The magazine also sometimes embedded small games like space shooters into the code. As the magazine became more sophisticated in its graphics, its size in kilobytes grew, but until close to its end fit onto a single floppy disk.

It was controversial for its frank discussion of government busts and its indirect involvement in various feuds. Although it was frequently criticized for this and other various reasons, most groups interacted with it because of its popularity.

{{about|the legal concept|a rebuttal used in informal logic|Counterargument}}

In [[law]], '''rebuttal''' is a form of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] that is presented to contradict or nullify other evidence that has been presented by an adverse party. By analogy the same term is used in [[politics]] and [[Public administration|public affairs]] to refer to the informal process by which statements, designed to refute or negate specific arguments put forward by opponents, are deployed in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url        = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/rebuttal
 |title      = Rebuttal
 |website    = www.thefreedictionary.com
 |accessdate = May 9, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, special rules apply to rebuttal; rebuttal evidence or rebuttal [[witness]]es must be confined solely to the subject matter of the evidence rebutted.  New evidence on other subjects may not be brought in rebuttal.  However, rebuttal is one of the few vehicles whereby a party may introduce surprise evidence or witnesses. The basic process is as follows:  both sides of a controversy are obliged to declare in advance of trial what witnesses they plan to call, and what each witness is expected to testify to. When either a [[plaintiff]] (or [[prosecutor]]) or [[defendant]] brings direct evidence or [[testimony]] which was not anticipated, the other side may be granted a specific opportunity to rebut it.  In rebuttal, the rebutting party may generally bring witnesses and evidence which were never before declared, so long as they serve to rebut the prior evidence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12720">The '''regulation of science''' refers to use of law, or other ruling, by [[academic]] or [[government]]al bodies to allow or restrict [[science]] from performing certain practices, or researching certain scientific areas. It is a [[bioethics|bioethical]] issue related to other practices such as [[abortion]] and [[euthanasia]]; and areas of research such as [[stem-cell research]] and [[cloning]] synthetic biology.

Science could be regulated by [[legislation]] if seen as harmful (such as euthanasia), [[immoral]] (such as abortion), or dangerous. For these reasons it is closely related to [[religion]], [[culture]] and [[society]].

==United States of America==

=== Biomedical Research ===
Unjust events such as the [[Jim (horse)|St. Louis tragedy]] or the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]] have prompted regulations in biomedical research. Over the years, regulations have extended to animal welfare and research misconduct. The federal government also monitors the production and sale of the results of biomedical research such as drugs and biopharmaceuticals. The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] and the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] oversee the implementation of these regulations.

The [[Dickey–Wicker Amendment]] prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from using appropriated funds for the creation of human embryos for research purposes or for research in which human embryos are destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/dickey-wicker-amendment-1996 |title=Dickey-Wicker Amendment, 1996 |last=Kearl |first=Megan |date=August 27, 2010 |website= |publisher=Embryo Project at Arizona State University |access-date=November 25, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Human Subject Research ====
The issue of experimentation on human subjects gained prominence after World War II and the revelation of atrocities committed in the name of science. In the United States, the 1962 [[Kefauver Harris Amendment|Kefauver-Harris amendments]] to the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] included for the first time a requirement for informed consent of participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peltzman|first=Sam|date=Sep–Oct 1973|title=An Evaluation of Consumer Protection Legislation: The 1962 Drug Amendments|url=|journal=The Journal of Political Economy|volume= 81| issue =  5.|pages=1051–91|via=|doi=10.1086/260107}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, a policy statement by the U.S Surgeon General required that all human subject research go through independent prior review.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.nih.gov/about/timelines_laws_human.html|title=Office of History, National Institutes of Health - Timeline of Laws Related to the Protection of Human Subjects|website=history.nih.gov|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Research Act of 1974 institutionalized this review process by requiring that research centers establish [[Institutional review board|Institutional Review Boards]] (IRBs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silberman, Sam and Katherine Kahn|first=|date=December 2011|title=Burdens on Research Imposed by Institutional Review Boards: The State of the Evidence and Its Implications for Regulatory Reform|jstor=23073390|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume= 89| issue =  4|pages=599–627|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universities, hospitals, and other research institutions set up these IRBs to review all the research done at the institution. These boards, generally composed of both scientific peers from the institution and lay persons, are tasked with assessing the risks and benefits associated with the use of human subjects, in addition to the adequacy of the protection and consent of the participants. The IRBs can approve research proposals, make modifications, or disapprove them entirely. Research projects cannot receive federal funding without approval from an IRB. Noncompliance can also induce sanctions from the institution, such as revoked access to facilities and subjects, suspension, and dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arthur M. Dula, Marshall J. Breger, Robert F. Boruch, Eldon Sutton, LeRoy Walters and Gary A. Ahrens|first=|date=Summer 1979|title=Government Regulation of Scientific Research|jstor=29761683|journal=Jurimetrics|volume= 19| issue =  4|pages= 299, 301–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Research Act]] of 1974 also set up the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, which produced the Belmont Report (Report on Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research) in 1979. This report established a moral framework for the regulation of research involving human subjects.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Animal Welfare ====
The [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966]] set standards of treatment of animals in research experiments. It requires all research facilities to register with the USDA and allows officials to conduct unannounced facility inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalwelfare/sa_awa/ct_awa_inspections|title=Animal Welfare Act Inspections|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Department of Agriculture|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Health Research Extension Act of 1985 requires that all research facilities using animals establish [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]]s (IACUCs) to evaluate twice a year the institutions' activities involving animals. The IACUCs report to the NIH [[Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare]] annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/guidebook.pdf|title=Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Guidebook|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Research Misconduct ====
The Health Research Extension Act of 1985 led to the establishment of the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) within the Department of Health and Human Services. ORI is responsible for reviewing research misconduct allegations and developing policies to improve the responsible conduct of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ori.hhs.gov/about-ori|title=About ORI {{!}} ORI - The Office of Research Integrity|website=ori.hhs.gov|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Commercialization ====
Two divisions of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) are in charge of monitoring the production and sale of drugs. The [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] (CDER) is responsible for reviewing new drug applications and requires clinical trials as proof of effectiveness. The [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research]] (CBER) is responsible for implementing federal regulations of [[biopharmaceutical]]s such as vaccines, blood components, gene therapies, etc. They approve new drugs on the basis of safety and effectiveness, and issue licenses, which allow companies to market their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CBER/default.htm|title=About the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)|last=Research|first=Center for Biologics Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear Energy Research ===
Nuclear energy is historically linked to issues of national security. From 1942 to 1946, nuclear research was controlled by the military, which conducted research in secrecy. In 1946, the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946|Atomic Energy Act]] handed over control to civilians, although the government retained a tight monopoly over nuclear energy. The 1954 amendment to this act enabled private industry to pursue non-military applications of nuclear research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunlavey|first=Dean C.|date=January 1957|title=Government Regulation of Atomic Industry|jstor=3310313|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume= 105| issue =  3|pages= 295–373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Energy Reorganization Act of 1974|Energy Reorganization Act]] of 1974 established the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC), in charge of licensing and safety. The Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents raised concerns and public apprehension over the safety of nuclear power. As a result, the NRC strengthened safety regulations for nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of Nuclear Regulation, 1946–2009|last=J. Samuel Walker and Thomas R. Wellock|first=|publisher=U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission|year=September 2010|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching ===
Science education is a controversial subject in the United States. Several states banned the teaching of evolution in the 20th century, most notably the state of Tennessee with the [[Butler Act]] of 1925. It was followed by the [[Scopes Trial]], in which the state of Tennessee accused Scopes, a high school teacher, of teaching evolution. Although he was found guilty and fined, the trial showed declining public support for Fundamentalists. The Scopes Trial had an important impact in the larger creation versus evolution debate. In the following decades, the term "evolution" was omitted in many biology textbooks, even when the text discusses it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Judith V. Grabiner and Peter D. Miller|first=|date=September 1974|title=Effects of the Scopes Trial|jstor=1738991|journal=Science, New Series|volume= 185| issue =  4154|pages= 832–837}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bans on teaching evolution were overturned by a Supreme Court ruling in [[Epperson v. Arkansas]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Randy|date=Nov–Dec 1998|title=Creationism in the United States: III. The Ban on the Teaching of Evolution Reaches the U.S. Supreme Court|jstor=4450576|journal=The American Biology Teacher|volume= 60| issue =  9|pages= 650–661|doi=10.2307/4450576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2001, there has been a resurgence of anti-evolution bills, one of which, the [[Louisiana Science Education Act]], was passed. This Act allows public schools to use supplementary material that is critical of the scientific theories such as evolution and global warming in science classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2008/06/louisiana-passes-first-antievolution-academic-freedom-law/|title=Louisiana passes first antievolution "academic freedom" law|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. government and state legislatures have also enacted regulations promoting science education. The [[National Defense Education Act]] of 1958 was passed soon after the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1 and linked education with issues of national security. This law provided funding for scholarships and science programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Defense-Education-Act|title=National Defense Education Act (NDEA) {{!}} United States [1958]|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, 26 state governments worked together to produce the [[Next Generation Science Standards]], which sets expectations for [[K–12]] science education.

== International Regulations ==
The [[Nuremberg Code]] was written as part of the trials of Nazi doctors after World War II. It introduced ten ethical principles regarding human experimentation, the first of which requires informed consent from human subjects. It also states that experimentation on humans must be necessary to society, be preceded by studies on animals, and protect subjects from injury, disability and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shuster|first=Evelyne|date=1997-11-13|title=Fifty Years Later: The Significance of the Nuremberg Code|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199711133372006|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=337|issue=20|pages=1436–1440|doi=10.1056/NEJM199711133372006|issn=0028-4793|pmid=9358142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nuremberg Code was very influential in shaping regulations of scientific research across the world. For example, the [[Declaration of Helsinki|Helsinki Declaration]] of 1964 was developed by the World Medical Association and establishes ethical principles for the medical community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/|title=WMA - The World Medical Association-WMA Declaration of Helsinki – Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects|website=www.wma.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|text=a [[reprise]], or with a [[wikt:reappraisal|reappraisal]]}}
A '''reprisal''' is a limited and deliberate violation of [[international law]] to punish another [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] state that has already broken them.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Josef Partsch: Self-Preservation. EPIL IV (2000), pages 380-383&lt;/ref&gt; Reprisals in the [[Law of war|laws of war]] are extremely limited, as they commonly breach the rights of [[non-combatant]]s, an action outlawed by the [[Geneva Conventions]]. It is not to be confused with [[retorsion]]s, as these constitute unfriendly acts generally permitted by international law.

==Etymology==
The word came from French, where it originally meant "act of taking back", for example, raiding back the equivalent of cattle lost to an enemy raid.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=reprisal reprisal (n.)] etymonline.com. Retrieved December 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law==
Reprisals refer to acts which are illegal if taken alone, but become legal when adopted by one state in retaliation for the commission of an earlier illegal act by another state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule145&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-reprisals are generally not allowed.

An example of reprisal is the [[Naulila]] dispute between [[Portugal]] and [[Germany]] in October 1914. After three Germans were mistakenly killed in Naulila on the border of the then-Portuguese colony of [[Angola]] (in a manner that did not violate international law),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/January-February-2003/scene_giry_janfeb2003.msp&lt;/ref&gt; Germany carried out a military raid on Naulila, destroying property in retaliation. A claim for compensation was brought by Portugal. The tribunal emphasized that before reprisals could be legally undertaken, a number of conditions had to be satisfied:
*There had to be a previous act by the other party that violated international law.
*Reprisals had to be preceded by an unsatisfied demand for reparation or compliance with the violated international law.
*There must be proportionality between the offence and reprisal.
The German claim that it had acted lawfully was rejected on all three grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Law (6th edn)|last=Shaw|first=Malcolm|authorlink=Malcolm Shaw|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-72814-0|page=1129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1945, as a result of the general prohibition on use of force imposed by Article 2(4) of the [[United Nations Charter]], armed reprisals in time of peace are no longer legal, but the possibility remains of non-armed reprisals (also known as [[countermeasure]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Public International Law (7th edn)|last=Brownlie|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Brownlie|year=2008|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-921770-0|page=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as belligerent reprisals during hostilities when the law of international armed conflict (LOIAC) is violated.&lt;ref name=loiac&gt;{{cite book|title=The Conduct of Hostilities under the Law of International Armed Conflict|last=Dinstein|first=Yôrām|authorlink=Yoram Dinstein|year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-54227-8|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a88YJ7MuaMoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+conduct+of+hostilities+under+the+law+of+international+armed+conflict#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of belligerent reprisals, apart from the three factors in the Naulila case, a warning must also be issued beforehand; once the other party has stopped violation of LOIAC, belligerent reprisals must also be terminated; and the decision to engage in belligerent reprisals must be taken by a competent authority.&lt;ref name=loiac/&gt; All four Geneva Conventions prohibit reprisals against, respectively, battlefield casualties, [[Shipwreck|shipwreck survivors]], [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], and protected persons ([[civilian]] or [[military]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule146|title=Customary IHL - Rule 146.

An additional 1977 protocol extends this to cover historic monuments, works of art, and places of worship.

The '''Road Traffic Act 1934''' was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] introduced by the [[Secretary of State for Transport|Minister of Transport]], [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]]. The Act was made in a year in which there had been a record numbers of road casualties.&lt;ref name=DM&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1247543/How-Thirties-saw-Britain-fall-love-car--nation-road-hogs.html|title=How the Thirties saw Britain fall in love with the car... and become a nation of road hogs|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=2010-02-25|location=London|first=Juliet|last=Gardiner|date=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
The [[Locomotive Acts]] of the late 1800s had placed heavy restrictions of speeds of "locomotives". Under pressure from an emerging motor industry and growing enthusiasm for motor cars the [[Locomotives on Highways Act 1896]] had reduced the restrictions and increased speed limits. Speed limits were again raised by the [[Motor Car Act 1903]] which also introduced requirements for registration of vehicles and for driving licenses as well as new safety legislation. The [[Road Traffic Act 1930]] had controversially removed all speed limits for motorcars in a year with record 7,305 road fatalities&lt;ref group="n" name=DfT2008Table2&gt;[[#Dft2008a|Department for Transport (2008)]], p. 106 table 2&lt;/ref&gt; since which the levels of fatalities had increased to 7,343 deaths and 231,603 injuries. Half the deaths were of pedestrians, and of these three-quarters occurred in built-up areas. [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Hore-Belisha]] spoke of this as "mass murder" and he was nearly killed shortly after his appointment during a public-relations exercise to demonstrate how to use the new "[[Zebra crossing|uncontrolled crossings]]" when a car sped through the crossing without stopping.&lt;ref name=DM/&gt; The [[Living Streets (UK)|Pedestrian's Association]] had been set up in 1929 to [[advocate]] on behalf of pedestrians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livingstreets.org.uk/who-we-are/our-organisation|title=Living Streets|publisher=Living Streets|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[The Automobile Association|Automobile Association]] and [[Royal Automobile Club]] resisting further legislation. The [[Salter Report]] which had been commissioned by the government was published in 1933 and recommended changes to the funding of both road and rail transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1933/feb/07/rail-and-road-conference-recommendations|title=RAIL AND ROAD CONFERENCE (RECOMMENDATIONS).|work=Hansard|accessdate=2010-05-04|date=1933-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clauses==
The Act:
*Reintroduced a speed limit for cars, of 30mph in built-up areas, reversing the removal of speed limits only 4 years earlier by the [[Road Traffic Act 1930]].
*The [[United Kingdom driving test|UK driving test]] was made compulsory for all new drivers from 1 June 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsa.gov.uk/Category.asp?cat=343|title=History of the British driving test|publisher=Driving Standards Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Strengthened legislation relating to insurance for drivers.&lt;ref name=Law&gt;{{cite book|title=The law of motor insurance|page=7,8|isbn=978-0-421-83930-4|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[Belisha beacon]], named after the Transport Minister, was introduced to clearly identify crossings. The 30&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit in urban areas remains the most common speed limit (as of 2015).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17542">'''Search and Seizure''' is a procedure used in many [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[common law]] legal systems by which [[police]] or other authorities and their agents, who, suspecting that a [[crime]] has been committed, commence a search of a person's property and [[confiscate]] any relevant evidence found in connection to the crime.
[[File:vehicle drug search australia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Dareton, New South Wales|Dareton]] police search the vehicle of a suspected drug smuggler in Wentworth, in the state of New South Wales, Australia, near the border with Victoria]]

Some countries have certain provisions in their [[constitution]]s that provide the public with the right to be free from "unreasonable searches and seizures". This right is generally based on the premise that everyone is entitled to a reasonable [[right to privacy]].

Though specific interpretation may vary, this right can often require [[law enforcement]] to obtain a [[search warrant]] or consent of the owner before engaging in any form of search and seizure. In cases where evidence is seized in a search, that evidence might be rejected by court procedures, such as with a [[motion to suppress]] the evidence under the [[exclusionary rule]].

==Italy==
In [[Italy]] protection from search and seizure is enshrined in Article 14 of the [[Italian Constitution|Constitution]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution|url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The home is inviolable.
Home inspections, searches, or seizures shall not be admissible save in the cases and manners complying with measures to safeguard personal liberty. Controls and inspections for reason of public health and safety, or for economic and fiscal purposes, shall be regulated by appropriate laws."

==New Zealand==
{{main|Unreasonable search and seizure in New Zealand}}

The right to be free from unreasonable [[search and seizure]] is well recognised by the international human rights community.&lt;ref&gt;International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, Art 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 21 of the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]] (NZBoRA 1990) incorporates this right into [[Law of New Zealand|New Zealand law]], stating that: "Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, whether of the person, property, or correspondence or otherwise."

While the NZBORA 1990 establishes the overall right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure the [[Search and Surveillance Act 2012]] provides the statutory framework for the practical application of the law in this area in New Zealand.

== United Kingdom ==
Historically, [[English law|English common law]] made use of a number of different types of legal [[writ]]s to effect seizures for various reasons. For example, a writ of ''[[arrestandis bonis ne dissipentur]]'' provided for the seizure of goods when it was found likely they would not be properly cared for during a court case to settle ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0187&amp;id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&amp;isize=M|title=History of Science: Cyclopædia, or, An universal dictionary of arts and sciences - Arboreus - artery|last=|first=|date=|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writ of ''[[attachiamenta bonorum]]'' allowed for the seizure of [[personal property]] to recover a debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0210&amp;q1=Attachiamenta|title=History of Science: Cyclopædia, or, An universal dictionary of arts and sciences - Attachiamenta - azymus|last=|first=|date=|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{main|Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution}}
The [[Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution]] states that:
{{quote|"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html |title=U.S. Const. amend. IV |work=Official Bill of Rights in the National Archives|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration|U.S. National Archives]]|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The text of the amendment is brief, and most of the law determining what constitutes an unlawful search and seizure is found in court rulings. The brief definitions of the terms "search" and "seizure" was concisely summarized in ''[[United States v. Jacobsen]]'', which said that the Fourth Amendment:
{{quote|"protects two types of expectations, one involving 'searches', the other 'seizures'.  A ''search'' occurs when an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable is infringed.  A ''seizure'' of property occurs where there is some meaningful interference with an individual's possessory interests in that property."&lt;ref&gt;''Jacobson v. United States'', {{ussc|466|109|1984|pin=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Warrant requirement===
The general rule under the [[United States Constitution]] is that a valid warrant is required for a search.&lt;ref name="warrant"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Are Your Fourth Amendment Rights|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/fires/fourth_amendment.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=11 September 2017|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, several exceptions to this rule, based on the language of the fourth amendment that the people are to be "secure ... against unreasonable searches and seizures".

For instance, the owner of the property in question may [[Consent searches|consent to the search]].  The consent must be voluntary, but there is no clear test to determine whether or not it is; rather, a court will consider the "[[totality of the circumstances]]" in assessing whether consent was voluntary. Police officers are ''not'' technically required to advise a suspect that he may refuse, however this policy depends on the specific rules of the department. There are also some circumstances in which a third party who has equal control, i.e. common authority, over the property may consent to a search. Another example of unreasonable search and seizure is in the court case [[Mapp V. Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapp v. Ohio, 367 US 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (1961)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=589965672959279882|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an individual does not possess a "[[reasonable expectation of privacy]]" that society is willing to acknowledge in a particular piece of property, any interference by the government with regard to that property is not considered a search for Fourth Amendment purposes, and a warrant is never required. For example, courts have found that a person does not possess a reasonable expectation of privacy in information transferred to a third party, such as writing on the outside of an envelope sent through the mail or left for pick-up in an area where others might view it. While that does not mean that the person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of that envelope, the Court has held that one does not possess a reasonable expectation of privacy that society is willing to acknowledge in the contents of garbage left outside the [[curtilage]] of a home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkins|first1=Richard G.|title=Defining the reasonable expectation of privacy: an emerging tripartite analysis|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|date=1987|volume=40|page=1077|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/vanlr40&amp;div=48&amp;id=&amp;page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DEA_Operation_Reciprocity_-_money_seizure.png|thumb|[[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] investigators found $5.6 million hidden in a ceiling compartment of a truck during a seizure (Operations Reciprocity, 1997)]]
There is also a lowered expectation of privacy inside of motor vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sklansky|first1=David A.|title=Traffic stops, minority motorists, and the future of the Fourth Amendment|journal=The Supreme Court Review|date=1 January 1997|volume=1997|page=271|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1355&amp;context=facpubs|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, it has also been held that, "The word 'automobile' is not a talisman in whose presence the Fourth Amendment fades away and disappears.” Coolidge v. New Hampshire &lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/443/case.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exceptions to the warrant requirement===
Courts have also established an "[[exigent circumstances]]" exception to the warrant requirement.&lt;ref name="warrant"/&gt; "Exigent circumstances" simply means that the officers must act quickly. Typically, this is because police have a reasonable belief that evidence is in imminent danger of being removed or destroyed, but there is still a [[probable cause]] requirement. Exigent circumstances may also exist where there is a continuing danger, or where officers have a reasonable belief that people in need of assistance are present. This includes when the police are in 'hot pursuit of a fleeing felon.' In this circumstance, so long as there is [[probable cause]], police may follow the suspect into a residence and seize any evidence in plain view.

Certain limited searches are also allowed during an investigatory stop or incident to an arrest. These searches may be referenced as refined searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heder|first1=Bill O.|title=The Development of Search and Seizure Law in Public Schools|journal=Brigham Young University Education and Law Journal|date=1999|page=71|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/byuelj1999&amp;div=16&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the interpretations of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] are binding on all federal courts interpreting the U.S. Constitution, there is some variance in the specifics from state to state, for two reasons.  First, if an issue has not been decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, then a lower court makes a ruling of "first impression" on the issue, and sometimes two different lower courts will reach different interpretations. Second, virtually all state constitutions also contain provisions regarding search and seizure.  Those provisions cannot reduce the protections offered by the U.S. Constitution, but they can provide additional protections such that a search deemed "reasonable" under the U.S. Constitution might nonetheless be unreasonable under the law of a particular state.

===Violation of the warrant requirement===
There are several areas of analysis that courts use to determine whether a search has encroached upon constitutional protections. Only those searches that meet with certainty each of the minimal measured requirements of the following four doctrines are likely to stand unchallenged in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitebread |first=Charles H.|date=2000|title=Criminal Procedure: An Analysis of Cases and Concepts. / Edition 5''|url= http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/criminal-procedure-charles-h-whitebread/1101184310;jsessionid=A6DD7B0FFFD244604D03C7EAC2CD2D80.prodny_store02-atgap10?ean=2901599411575&amp;pcta=u&amp;st=PLA&amp;sid=BNB_DRS_Core%20Shopping%20Textbooks_00000000&amp;2sid=Google_&amp;sourceId=PLGoP62414|location= MN |publisher= Foundation Press/ West Academic|page=1019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those qualifying doctrines are reasonableness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Regina v Smith |vol=4 |reporter=AER |opinion=289 |pinpoint= |court= |year=2000 |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldjudgmt/jd000727/smith-1.htm |quote=[sub-citing Camplin and Bedder:] the concept of the "reasonable man" has never been more than a way of explaining the law to a jury; an anthropomorphic image to convey to them, with a suitable degree of vividness, the legal principle that even under provocation, people must conform to an objective standard of behaviour that society is entitled to expect }}&lt;/ref&gt; probable cause&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brinegar v.

Uscourts.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; and particularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gryzlo |first=Joseph P.|title=A Balancing Act: Fourth Amendment Protections and the Reasonable Scope of Government Investigatory Access to E-Mail Accounts.|year=2016|publisher=John's L|page=495}}&lt;/ref&gt; While police judgment just before or during the course of a search or arrest usually provides the factors that determine reasonableness, matters of probable cause, judicial authority, and particularity requirements are commonly met through police procedures that are overseen by a court judge or magistrate prior to any search or arrest being conducted. Probable cause requires an acceptable degree of justified suspicion. Particularity requirements are spelled out in the constitution text itself. Law enforcement compliance with those requirements is scrutinized prior to the issuance of a warrant being granted or denied by an officiating judicial authority.&lt;ref name="uscourts.gov"/&gt;

====Exclusionary rule====
The primary remedy in illegal search cases is known as the "[[exclusionary rule]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loewenthal|first1=Milton A.|title=Evaluating the Exclusionary Rule in Search and Seizure|journal=Anglo-American Law Review|date=1 October 1980|volume=9|issue=4|page=238|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/147377958000900403?journalCode=clwa|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that any evidence obtained through an illegal search is excluded and cannot be used against the defendant at his or her trial. There are some narrow exceptions to this rule.  For instance, if police officers acted in good faith—perhaps pursuant to a warrant that turned out to be invalid, but that the officers had believed valid at the time of the search—evidence may be admitted.

===Administrative searches===
In corporate and [[administrative law]], there has been an evolution of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] interpretation in favor of stronger government in regards to investigatory power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Primus|first1=Eve B.|title=Disentangling Administrative Searches|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=March 2011|volume=111|issue=2|jstor=29777196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Donald D., and Howard R. Whitcomb, ''The legal foundations of public administration'' (Lanham, Md: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers), 122.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Federal Trade Commission v. American Tobacco Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;''Federal Trade Commission v. American Tobacco Co.'', {{ussc|264|298|1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the FTC, while having been granted a broad subpoena power, did not have the right to a general "[[fishing expedition]]" into the private papers, to search both relevant and irrelevant, hoping that something would come up. [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Justice Holmes]] ruled that this would go against "the spirit and the letter" of the Fourth Amendment.

In the 1946 case of ''Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling'',&lt;ref&gt;''Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling'', {{ussc|327|186|1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was a distinction made between a "figurative or constructive search" and an actual search and seizure. The court held that constructive searches are limited by the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], where actual search and seizure requires a [[search warrant|warrant]] based on “[[probable cause]]”. In the case of a [[constructive search]] where the records and papers sought are of corporate character, the court held that the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] does not apply, since [[corporations]] are not entitled to all the constitutional protections created in order to protect the rights of private individuals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2591">A '''[[seneschal]]''' (''siniscallus'', Vulgar or old Frankish Latin, also ''dapifer'') was an officer of an aristocratic household assigned to manage the domestic affairs of the lord.  During the course of the twelfth century, the seneschalship also became an office of military command.

==Power of the Angevin Seneschals==
The seneschal came also to act as a business manager, coordinating between the receivers of various landholdings and the chamber, camera or treasury, and the chancellory or chapel.  When the [[Count of Anjou|counts of Anjou]] began acquiring large territorial holdings outside of their traditional patrimony, their rule became more and more absentee.  With the rule of [[Henry II of England]], the office of seneschal had become almost vice-regal.  The seneschals of Anjou, like those appointed in [[Normandy]], [[Poitou]], and [[Gascony]] had custody of demesne fortresses, the regional treasuries, and presidency of the highest court of regional custom.  Although there is no direct evidence that an Exchequer court of Anjou existed, traces of a Poitevin Exchequer and detailed records of the Gascon Exchequers during the reign of [[Henry III of England]] would indicate that there most likely was a functioning exchequer, probably at [[Chinon]] which served as the central treasury and chief stronghold of Anjou, [[Maine]], and [[Touraine]].

==Seneschals Appointed by the Angevin Kings of England==
* [[Stephen of Tours]] or Marçay, knight ({{lang-la|miles}}) of Tours (appointed no later than 1160, served until 1189 when he was imprisoned for fiscal mismanagement)
* Payen de Rochefort, lord of Rochefort-sur-Loire (1189–1190)
* [[Stephen of Tours]] (restored, 1190–1196)
* [[Robert of Thornham]] (1196–1199), English knight, eventual lord of [[Mulgres]] ([[Mulgrave Castle]]), his nephew Thomas de Furnes was castellan of Angers in 1199
* [[Aimery VII, viscount of Thouars|Aimery VII]], [[viscount of Thouars]] (1199–1200)
* [[William des Roches]], lord of Sable, (1200–1202)
* [[Brice the Chamberlain]] (1202–1203)

==Capetian Seneschals of Anjou==
* William des Roches, (1199–1200, 1204–1222)
* [[Amauri I de Craon]], lord of Craon and Sable (1222–1226)
the office continued down the male line of the Craon family

The '''Supreme Court Reports''' (S.C.R.) is the official [[reporter (law)|reporter]] of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. Since the creation of the Supreme Court, all of its decisions have been published in the Reports, in both English and French. The first volume was published in 1877 containing the first case ever heard by the Supreme Court, ''[[Kelly v. Sullivan]]''. 

Initially, the reports were identified from 1 to 64, but from 1923 they have been identified by their year of publication. By 1975 the reporter started putting out two volumes a year, which increased to between 3 and 4 by 1990. Volumes from 1983 and later are also available in electronic format, hosted by [[LexUM]] at the [[Université de Montréal]].

{{Cite bailii|litigants='''Trustee of FC Jones and Son (a firm) v Jones''' |year=1996 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=1324}} is an [[English unjust enrichment law]] case, concerning to what extent enrichment of the defendant must be at the expense of the claimant.

==Facts==
Mr Jones transferred £11,700 in cheques from his [[potato]] growing firm’s [[bank account]] to Mrs Jones. The firm became insolvent, which vested the account retrospectively into the [[trustee in bankruptcy]]. Mrs Jones bought potato [[Futures contract|futures]], and earned £50,760. This was put into an account with Raphael &amp; Sons plc. The [[Official Receiver]] claimed that under the [[Bankruptcy Act 1914]] sections 37 and 38, the money belonged to it. Mrs Jones claimed it was hers, but the sum was paid into court.

==Judgment==
[[Peter Millett, Baron Millett|Millett LJ]] held the trustee in bankruptcy could recover everything. From the date of the act of bankruptcy, all money in the bankrupts’ joint accounts belonged to the trustee in bankruptcy. Mr Jones had no title to the money paid out, and could therefore not pass title to Mrs Jones. Equity had no role. The deposit of the trustee’s money under the contract’s terms with the commodity broker belonged to the trustee.

Significantly in Jones it was indicated that a [[fiduciary|fiduciary relationship]] was no longer an exclusive precondition for the use of [[tracing (law)|equitable tracing]], the fiduciary character of the defendant's receipt was expressly negatived.

[[File:Baldknobbersrr.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bald Knobbers]], an 1880s vigilante group from [[Missouri]], wearing crude "[[blackface]]" masks typical of the [[post-Reconstruction]] era in the United States &amp;ndash; as portrayed in the 1919 film, ''The Shepherd of the Hills''.]]
A '''vigilante''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|v|ɪ|dʒ|ɪ|ˈ|l|æ|n|t|i|}}, {{IPAc-en||ˌ|v|ɪ|dʒ|ɪ|ˈ|l|æ|n|t|eɪ|}}; {{IPA-es|bixiˈlante|lang}}; {{IPA-pt|viʒiˈlɐ̃t(ɨ)|lang}}, {{IPA-pt|viʒiˈlɐ̃tʃi|}}) is a [[civilian]] or organization acting in a [[law enforcement]] capacity (or in the pursuit of self-perceived justice) without legal authority.

==Vigilante conduct==

"Vigilante justice" is often rationalized by the concept that proper legal forms of criminal punishment are either nonexistent, insufficient, or inefficient. Vigilantes normally see the government as ineffective in enforcing the law; such individuals often claim to justify their actions as a fulfillment of the wishes of the community.

Persons alleged to be escaping the law or above the law are sometimes the victims of vigilantism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csvr.org.za/papers/papvtp1.htm |title="As for Violent Crime that's our Daily Bread": Vigilante violence during South Africa's period of transition |first1=Bronwyn |last1=Harris |date=May 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203104624/http://www.csvr.org.za/papers/papvtp1.htm |archivedate=2007-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vigilante conduct involves varied degrees of violence. Vigilantes could assault targets verbally and/or physically, damage and/or vandalize property, or even murder individuals.

In a number of cases, vigilantism has involved targets with mistaken identities.

==History==
Vigilantism and the vigilante ethos existed long before the word ''vigilante'' was introduced into the English language. There are conceptual and psychological parallels between the [[Dark Age]] and medieval [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] custom of [[private war]] or [[Feud|vendetta]] and the modern vigilante philosophy.

Elements of the concept of vigilantism can be found in the Biblical account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 34 of the abduction and rape (or, by some interpretations, seduction) of [[Dinah]], the daughter of [[Jacob]], in the [[Canaan]]ite city of [[Shechem]] by the eponymous son of the ruler, and the violent reaction of her brothers [[Simeon (Hebrew Bible)|Simeon]] and [[Levi]], who slew all of the males of the city in revenge, rescued their sister and plundered Shechem. When Jacob protested that their actions might bring trouble upon him and his family, the brothers replied "Should he [i.e., Shechem] treat our sister as a harlot?"

Similarly, in {{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 13}}, [[Absalom]] kills [[Amnon]] after [[King David]], their father, fails to punish Amnon for raping [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]], their sister.

Recourse to personal vengeance and [[dueling]] was considered a class privilege of the sword-bearing aristocracy before the formation of the modern centralized liberal-bureaucratic nation-state (see [[Marc Bloch]], trans. L. A. Manyon, ''Feudal Society'', Vol. I, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;127). In addition, sociologists{{Who|date=July 2015}} have posited a complex legal and ethical interrelationship between vigilante acts and [[rebellion]] and [[tyrannicide]].

In the [[western culture|Western]] literary and cultural tradition, characteristics of ''vigilantism'' have often been vested in folkloric heroes and legendary [[outlaw]]s (e.g., [[Robin Hood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6OZHSrJCRAC&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;dq=%22robin+hood%22+vigilantism#PPA316,M1|title=A Great Effusion of Blood?: Interpreting Medieval Violence|author=Mark D. Meyerson, Daniel Thiery|date=2004-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Vigilantism in literature, folklore and legend is connected to the fundamental issues of dissatisfied morality, injustice, the failures of authority and the ethical adequacy of legitimate governance.

During medieval times, punishment of felons was sometimes exercised by such [[secret societies]] as the courts of the [[Vehm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Germany: Die Feme | publisher = Time | date = Oct 16, 1944 | url = http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,885763-1,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[cf.]] the medieval Sardinian ''Gamurra'' later become ''Barracelli'', the Sicilian [[Vendicatori]] and the [[Beati Paoli]]), a type of early vigilante organization, which became extremely powerful in Westphalian Germany during the 15th century.

===Colonial era in America===
Formally-defined vigilantism arose in the early American colonies.

*Established the mid-18th century, for instance, the [[Regulator movement]] of American colonial times was composed of citizen volunteers of the [[frontier]] who opposed [[official misconduct]] and [[extrajudicial]]ly punished banditry as well as protected colonists from indigenous Americans' enforcement of border control.

===India===
{{see also|Moral police}}
In India, vigilante refers to when a group metes out [[Law of India|extralegal]] punishment to alleged lawbreakers. [[Vigilantism]] is also referred to as "mob justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===19th century===
{{Globalize|section|date=August 2015}}
As boom-towns, or mining towns in California because of the Gold Rush, started appearing towards the 1850s, vigilantes started taking justice into their own hands because these towns did not have any established forms of government. These people would assault accused thieves, rapists and murderers. When they assaulted these thieves, they would steal their gold and give it to the accuser. Other than reports and newspapers, there are not many records of vigilantes. Few names or groups are known.

[[File:Great Hanging at Gainesville, Texas - 1862.jpg|thumb|right|"Great Hanging at Gainesville", 1862]]

Later in the United States, vigilante groups arose in poorly governed frontier areas where criminals preyed upon the citizenry with impunity.&lt;ref&gt;

* [[Los Angeles]] and the bordering counties experienced outbursts of vigilantism from the early 1850s as many of the criminals driven out of San Francisco and the [[Gold Country]] expanded into the less-populated "Cow Counties" of [[Southern California]], making the city and nearby countryside a dangerous place for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote=The homicide rate between 1847 and 1870 averaged 158 per 100,000 (13 murders per year), which was 10 to 20 times the annual murder rates for New York City during the same period |first=Eric |last=Monkkonen |title=Western Homicide: The Case of Los Angeles, 1830–1870 |journal=Pacific Historical Review |volume=74 |year=2005 |issue=4 |pages=603–618 [p. 609] |doi=10.1525/phr.2005.74.4.603 |jstor= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Bleeding Kansas]] during the run-up to the [[American Civil War]], the [[Sacking of Lawrence]] in May 1856 by a posse (or, in some accounts, a mob) led by the local sheriff—who justified their destruction of the town founded by anti-slavery activists on the grounds that it was a hotbed of rebellion against the official pro-slavery territorial government—was answered just days later by the midnight [[Pottawatomie massacre]] of five pro-slavery settlers by anti-slavery activists commanded by [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], citing the dead men's alleged involvement in the attack on Lawrence and other attacks on anti-slavery forces.

* In October 1862 in northern Texas, several [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionist]] sympathizers were arrested and taken to [[Gainesville, Texas]] for trial on charges of treason and insurrection.  Seven were tried and hung, and 14 were hung without trial.  A few weeks later, Unionist sympathizers were hung without trial across northern Texas.  Known as the "[[Great Hanging at Gainesville]]", it may have been the deadliest act of vigilante violence in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Under the Rebel Flag: Life in Texas During the Civil War | publisher = Texas State Library and Archives Commission | year = 2011 | url = https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/civilwar/dissent.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From late December 1863 to 1864 the [[Montana Vigilantes]] were formed by citizens of [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]], [[Virginia City, Montana|Virginia City]] and nearby [[Nevada City, Montana|Nevada City]] to fight lawlessness in the gold mining region of Montana. Over the next month, 21 men were hanged, including, on January 10, 1864, [[Henry Plummer]] the sheriff of Bannack, who was also the leader of a major gang of highwaymen. The last man hanged by the vigilantes may have done nothing more than express an opinion that several of those hanged previously had been innocent.
* In 1865, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] was formed in Pulaski, Tennessee by a group of six Confederate War veterans.  The KKK or "Klan" sought to use extralegal force to resist [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] South of the United States. The KKK became a leading agent of [[Racism|racist]] and [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] violence in the United States.

* Active in 1883–1889, the [[Bald Knobbers]] (or "Baldknobbers") were masked men who retaliated against invading [[:wikt:marauder|marauder]]s and drove out outlaws in [[Taney County, Missouri]].
* In [[New Orleans]] on [[March 14, 1891 lynchings|March 14, 1891]], a mob of vigilantes [[March 14, 1891 lynchings|stormed a jailhouse and lynched]] the [[Italian people|Italian]] immigrants imprisoned inside. Amid rising [[anti-Italianism]], the impoverished Italian and [[Sicily|Sicilian]] immigrants in the jailhouse had been blanketly and summarily rounded up and charged baselessly on suspicion of [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] involvement and involvement in the murder of [[David Hennessy]]. When the Italian immigrants were acquitted, a lynch mob forcibly entered the jail, executing and hanging the Italians. Later, in [[Tallulah, Louisiana]] in 1899, three [[Italian-American]] immigrant shopkeepers were lynched because they had given equal status in their shops to [[African Americans|black]] customers. A vigilante mob ultimately hanged five Italian-Americans during the incident: the three Italian shopkeepers and two Italian bystanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= The Italian Americans |first= Allon |last= Schoener |publisher= Macmillan Publishing Company |year= 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* In March 1898, the "101" of [[Skagway, Alaska]] posted handbills and held meetings trying to free the town of a bunco gang known as the "Soap Gang" under the control of the infamous [[Soapy Smith]]. Four months after its creation the 101 shot and killed Soapy in a [[shootout on Juneau Wharf]].

[[File:Xdccpacks.gif|thumb|A list of packs available from an XDCC bot]]

'''XDCC''' ('''Xabi DCC''' or '''eXtended DCC''') is a computer [[file sharing]] method which uses the [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC) network as a host service.

== History ==
Limitations in the original [[Direct Client-to-Client|DCC protocol]] prevented the transfers of very large files, or groups of files. XDCC was developed to allow batching of files together, and requesting/sending those files to others.&lt;ref name="Securing"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sachs, Marcus |author2=Piccard, Paul |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZU95ZdQ908C&amp;pg=PA387#v=onepage&amp;f=false |title=Securing IM and P2P Applications for the Enterprise |publisher=Syngress |page=387|isbn=978-1-59749-017-7 |accessdate=2013-04-09|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

XDCC was initially a [[Script (computer programming)|script]] written in 1994 for [[ircII]]&lt;ref name="the book of irc"&gt;{{cite book | last = Charalabidis | first = Alex | title = The Book of IRC: The Ultimate Guide to Internet Relay Chat | edition = 1st | date = 1999-12-15 | publisher = [[No Starch Press]] | location = [[San Francisco, California]] | isbn = 1-886411-29-8 | pages = 219&amp;nbsp;– 220 | chapter = DCC: File Servers and XDCC }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://xa.bi/ Xabi]. This script extends the ircII DCC command. Now XDCC refers to [[IRC bot]]s running [[file sharing]] programs in general.&lt;ref name="steal this file sharing book"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wang | first = Wallace | title = Steal this File Sharing Book | edition = 1st | date = 2004-10-25 | publisher = [[No Starch Press]] | location = [[San Francisco, California]] | isbn = 1-59327-050-X | page = 66 | chapter = Instant Messaging and Online Chat Rooms: Downloading files from IRC }}&lt;/ref&gt; XDCC bots serve one or more usually large files for download using the [[Direct Client-to-Client|DCC protocol]]. Though XDCC is commonly employed in distributing illegal content, such as [[warez]] releases of software, music, and movies, it can also be used in legal ways.

== Features ==

Unlike [[peer-to-peer]] transfers, XDCC servers are often hosted on connections with very high upstream bandwidth, sometimes in excess of 100 Mbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nipponsei.minglong.org/packlist/archive/|title=Nipponsei - Music Fresh From Japan|publisher=|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] servers are also running on the XDCC servers to facilitate uploading of materials to them. Many XDCC servers run on security compromised computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~bukys/host/tonikgin/EduHacking.html|title=XDCC|publisher=|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

Since browser-based IRC scripts are not compatible with the DCC protocol, users need to install a program such as mIRC on their computer. In order to receive files, the software has to be properly configured, otherwise downloads will be rejected by the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theloadguru.com/how-to-configure-mirc/|title=How To Configure mIRC For Downloading|work=The Load Guru|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To use XDCC, one can send a private message (query) or send a [[Client-To-Client Protocol|CTCP]] command to a bot, using an [[IRC]] client. The user can ask a bot what files it has by private messaging "xdcc list" to the bot. However, this feature is often disabled as to not attract too much attention. When a user wants to download a packet or file from a bot, the user would type something such as "xdcc send #&lt;pack number&gt;" to the bot. The bot will either start sending the user the packet or the bot will place the user in a queue, and force the user to wait their turn. Some channels have special rules, for example requiring the user to join a second channel within a certain amount of time after starting the download to avoid interruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theloadguru.com/mirc-guide-troubleshooting/|title=How To Download With mIRC: Troubleshooting|work=The Load Guru|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Addons exist, such as XDCCKlipper (for mIRC) which listen to adverts listed in a channel by the bots and save them to a separate window to facilitate easier browsing and allow users to view the status of a bot (speed, queues, slots etc.).

== Search engines ==

A number of search engines exist, indexing the IRC / XDCC network very much like sites such as [[The Pirate Bay]] does for torrents.

Currently active indexers include:
