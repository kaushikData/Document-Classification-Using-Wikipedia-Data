A '''bankruptcy remote''' [[company (law)|company]] is a company  within a [[corporate group]] whose [[bankruptcy]] has as little economic impact as possible on other entities within the group. A bankruptcy remote company is often a [[single-purpose entity]].

In practice, due to the concept of [[limited liability]], most companies in developed [[legal system]]s will be ''de facto'' bankruptcy remote from other members of the group (except in limited circumstances where [[creditor]]s are permitted to [[piercing the corporate veil|pierce the corporate veil]]).  However, in financial structuring, references to bankruptcy remoteness usually imply additional steps being taken to protect group members from attendant liability, such as by using an [[orphan structure]] to remove the legal ownership of the bankruptcy remote vehicle from the group, whilst retaining the economic benefits of it.  Such structures are used where the vehicle's activities may give liability to the group as a whole, for example, under certain [[environmental protection]] legislation, or in relation to [[tax]] liabilities in certain countries.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2011}}
A '''beth din''' ({{lang-he-n|בית דין}} ''Bet Din'', "house of judgement" {{IPA-he|bet ˈdin|}}, &lt;small&gt;Ashkenazic:&lt;/small&gt; '''''beis din''''') is a [[rabbi]]nical [[court]] of [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ginzberg|first1=Louis|title=Bet Din|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3189-bet-din|website=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=1 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072627/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3189-bet-din|archivedate=3 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient times, it was the building block of the legal system in the Biblical [[Land of Israel]]. Today, it is invested with legal powers in a number of religious matters ('''''din Torah''''', "matter of litigation", plural '''''dinei Torah''''') both in [[Israel]] and in Jewish communities in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]], where its judgments hold varying degrees of authority (depending upon the jurisdiction and subject matter) in matters specifically related to Jewish religious life.

== Antiquity and historical value ==
[[meforshim|Commentators]] point out that the first suggestion in the [[Torah]] that the ruler divest his legal powers and delegate his power of judgment to lower courts was made by [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]] to [[Moses]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|18:14–26|HE}}). This situation was formalised later when God gave the explicit command to "establish judges and officers in your gates" ([[Deuteronomy]] {{bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|16:18|HE}}).

There were three types of courts ([[Mishnah]], [[Talmud|tractate]] ''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]]'' 1:1-4 and 1:6):
* The [[Sanhedrin]], the grand central court on the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]], numbering 71
*Smaller courts of 23, called a Sanhedrin Ketana ("small Sanhedrin"). These courts could pass the [[corporal punishment (Judaism)|death verdict]]. These existed on two levels, the one higher in standing than the other:
**The [[Capital (political)|main cities]] of the [[Tribes of Israel|tribes]], had a court of 23
**All towns of a minimum size (either 120 or 230 people) had to have a court of 23, which was under the jurisdiction of the tribal court
*The smallest court of three was found in villages with a population of less than 120 people. Any smaller court (including a court of three laymen) could not pass binding verdicts and only dealt with monetary matters.

[[File:Tomb of Judah II and his Beth Din ap 004.jpg|thumb|Tomb of [[Judah II]] from the third century.]]
Participation in these courts required the classical ''[[semicha]]'', the transmission of judicial authority in an unbroken line down from Moses. Since the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE, or at the latest the abolition of the position of [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]] in 425 CE, the transmission of ''semicha'' has been suspended. Attempts in the 16th century to reinstate the ''semicha'' were unsuccessful; [[Yosef Karo|Rabbi Yosef Karo]] was one of the recipients of this ''semicha''.

The Mishnah and [[Talmud]] distinguish between ritual or criminal matters and monetary matters (''issurim'' and ''mamonoth'') and impose different regulations for them, with criminal cases generally having much more stringent limitations. Courts ruled in both kinds of cases. Any question that could not be resolved by a smaller court was passed up to a higher court. If the Sanhedrin was still uncertain, divine opinion was sought through the ''[[Urim and Thummim|Urim ve-Tumim]]'' (the parchment in the High Priest's breastplate, which was inscribed with the [[The names of God in Judaism|Name of God]] and could give supernatural clues).

Given the suspension of ''semicha'', any beth din existing in medieval or modern times is in theory a court of laymen, acting as arbitrators.  In practice they are given greater powers than this by the local ''takkanot ha-kahal'' (community regulations), and are generally composed of experienced rabbis.  Modern training institutes, especially in Israel, confer a qualification of ''dayan'' (religious judge) which is superior to the normal rabbinical qualification.

Even though normally an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] beth din requires a minimum of three Jews knowledgeable and observant of [[Halakha]] (Jewish Law), in new communities and exigencies, providing a thorough search has proved unfruitful, ''halakhah'' provides that even one Orthodox Jew can establish a beth din, since every Orthodox community is required to establish its own beth din.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

== Present situation ==
[[File:Kosher BethDin.jpg|thumb|[[Kosher foods|Kosher meal]] approved by the Beth din of [[Johannesburg]]]]

In [[Orthodox Judaism]], a ''beth din'' consists of three observant [[Jew]]ish men, at least one of whom is widely knowledgeable in Jewish law ([[halakha]]), to be capable of instructing the other members in any matters of halakha relevant to the case being heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Conversion.html|title=Conversion to Judaism|author=|date=|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304220922/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Conversion.html|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In progressive communities, women may serve on the ''beth din'' as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/jewish-law/committee-jewish-law-and-standards/hoshen-mishpat#testimony Rabbinical Assembly Responsa on Testimony] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128022934/http://rabbinicalassembly.org/jewish-law/committee-jewish-law-and-standards/hoshen-mishpat |date=2012-01-28 }} Retrieved 1-17-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, a permanent ''beth din'' will consist of three rabbis, while a ''beth din'' for an occasional matter (such as handling religious vows) need not consist of rabbis. A ''beth din'' which handles cases involving complex monetary issues or large community organizations requires "judges" (''dayanim'', singular: ''dayan''), who require an additional ''[[semicha]]'' (''yadin yadin'') which enables them to participate in such a ''beth din'' and adjudicate complex cases involving highly technical points of law.

A ''Beth Din'' is required or preferred for the following matters:
* ''[[Get (divorce document)|Get]] (divorce document), along with dealing with husbands who refuse to give their wives one.
* ''[[Kosher]]'' certification of restaurants and food manufacturers (''[[Hechsher]]'').
* Examination of [[shochet]]im and the control of the [[shechita]] inspectors
* [[Conversion to Judaism|Conversions to Judaism]] with at least one member of the court being a [[rabbi]] who is an expert on the laws of conversion.
* Supervising the building and maintenance of a ''[[mikvah]]''.
* Determination of "personal status" (i.e. whether someone is a [[Who is a Jew?|Jew according to ''halakha'']]).
* The authorization and supervision of [[mohel]]im.
* Questions relating to [[Jewish bereavement|burial practices and mourning]].

A ''beth din'' is sometimes used within the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Jewish community to resolve civil disputes, with the [[Shulkhan Arukh]]&lt;ref&gt;Choshen Mishpat 26.&lt;/ref&gt; calling for civil cases being resolved by religious instead of secular courts (''arka'oth''). Modern Western societies increasingly permit civil disputes to be resolved by private [[arbitration]], enabling religious Jews to enter into agreements providing for  arbitration by a particular ''beth din'' in the event of a dispute. By this device, the rules, procedures, and judgment of the ''beth din'' are accepted and can be enforced by secular courts in the same manner as those of a secular arbitration association. For example, in a 2018 decision, the Court of Appeal in Ontario, Canada, enforced an arbitration decision by the New York rabbinical court tribunal Beth Din (or Bais Din) of Mechon L’Hoyroa, in Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canlii.ca/t/hszrj|title=Popack v. Lipszyc, 2018 ONCA 635|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawtimesnews.com/author/anita-balakrishnan/oca-upholds-us-rabbinical-courts-award-16024/|title=OCA upholds U.S. rabbinical court’s award - Law Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the decisions of religious courts cannot be binding without the prior agreement of both parties, and will otherwise act only as mediation. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} &lt;!--More here--&gt;

== Officers of a beth din ==
A large ''beth din'' may have the following officers:

*'''[[Av Beth Din]]''' ({{Hebrew|אב בית דין}}, literally "Chief of the Court", abbreviated {{Hebrew|אב"ד}} / ABD) is the most senior [[jurist]] who may join in the [[adjudication]] of cases or advise the presiding ''dayanim''. The ''av beth din'' will usually be a highly respected ''[[rabbi]]'' and ''[[posek]]'', who can give [[responsa]]. Traditionally, the salaried [[rabbi]] of the local Jewish community served as the ''av beth din''
*'''Rosh Beth Din''' ({{Hebrew|ראש בית דין}}, literally "Head of the Court", abbreviated {{Hebrew|רב"ד}}) is equivalent to a [[chief justice]]. He will be the senior member of a three-judge panel. In smaller courts the ''av beth din'' also serves as the ''rosh''.
*'''Dayan''' ({{Hebrew|דיין}}, rabbinic judge, plural: dayanim) sits and adjudicates cases. A rabbinic judge may directly question and [[cross-examine]] [[witness]]es.
*'''Chaver Beth Din''' ({{Hebrew|חבר בית דין}} Friend of the Court, [[Amicus curiae]]) is an internal adviser to the court. He may bring specialised expertise to the ''beth din''. Often a ''chaver'' will be a ''dayan'' with training in secular law or science who can share his experience and perspectives with the court. For example, some ''battei din'' that deal with issues of [[Shechita|''shechiṭṭah'']] may have a ''chaver'' who is knowledgeable about [[veterinary medicine]] or [[meat science]] to assist the court as an [[expert witness]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4313">'''The Brazilian resolution''' was presented to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] of [[United Nations|the United Nations]] in 2003.
The resolution covered [[human rights]] and [[sexual orientation]]. E/CN.4/2003/L.92*
It came under the Commission on Human Rights, fifty-ninth session, item 17 on the agenda.

Discussion of the resolution was postponed in 2004 because it was felt that it would not be passed.  A formal [[UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]] was discussed in the General Assembly on 18 December 2008.

==The draft resolution==

The draft resolution was backed by [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

The resolution reaffirmed the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]], the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. It affirmed the equal and [[inalienable rights]] of all people, that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms the principle of the inadmissibility of discrimination, and that [[human rights education]] is a key to changing attitudes and behaviour and to promoting [[Respect diversity|respect for diversity]] in societies.

==Resolution==

{{Tort law}}

The [[tort]] of '''breach of confidence''' is, in [[Law of the United States|United States law]], a [[common law]] tort that protects private information that is conveyed in confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.inbrief.co.uk/contract-law/breach-of-confidence/|title=Breach of confidence|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A claim for breach of confidence typically requires the information to be of a confidential nature, which was communicated in confidence and was disclosed to the detriment of the claimant.

Establishing a breach of confidentiality depends on proving the existence and breach of a duty of confidentiality. Courts in the US look at the nature of the relationship between the parties. Most commonly, breach of confidentiality applies to the patient-physician relationship but it can also apply to relationships involving banks, hospitals, and insurance companies and many others.

There is no tort of breach of confidence in other common law jurisdictions such as the [[United Kingdom]] or [[Australia]], however, there is an [[Breach of confidence in English law|equitable doctrine of breach of confidence]].

The '''Children and Young Persons Act&amp;nbsp;1933''' (23&amp;nbsp;&amp; 24 Geo.5&amp;nbsp;c.12) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. It consolidated all existing child protection legislation for [[England and Wales]] into one act.  It was preceded by the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1920]] and the [[Children Act 1908]].  It is modified by the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1963]], the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1969]] and the [[Children and Young Persons Act 2008]].

== Content ==

The Children and Young Persons Act 1933 raised the minimum age for execution to&amp;nbsp;eighteen, raised the [[age of criminal responsibility]] from seven to&amp;nbsp;eight, included guidelines on the employment of school-age children, set a minimum working age of fourteen, and made it illegal for adults to sell cigarettes or other tobacco products to children. The act is worded to ensure that adults and not children are responsible for enforcing it.

== History ==

The act was passed a year after the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1932|Children and Young Persons Act&amp;nbsp;1932]] broadened the powers of juvenile courts and introduced supervision orders for children at risk.

Some sections of the act concerning the employment of children are still in force today.

S39. and 49 of the Act remains in everyday use in order to protect the identity of juvenile defendants appearing in Courts in England and Wales.

==Section 39 and 49: information for journalists==

Sections 39 and 49 are used to protect the identity of children and young people who appear in court as witnesses, victims and suspects. Journalists may not give the following about the accused:

*Their name
*Address
*School
*Still or moving image; or
*Any particulars likely to lead to the identification of any person aged under 18 concerned in the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanna|first=Mark|title=McNae's Essential Law for Journalists 21st Edition|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19960869-0|pages=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
The differences between the sections are that Section 39 is discretionary, but section 49 is automatically given in the youth courts. However, it can be waived in the following circumstances:

* If it is counterproductive to the defence of the accused. For example, they need people to come forward to say the accused was at a meeting in London when the crime was committed in Liverpool. Also, if the accused is using a defence of mistaken identity.
* If the police need to trace someone who is accused of an offence that warrants a sentence of 14 years imprisonment or more, the press can publish and broadcast details. There is an unofficial defence to the [[Contempt of Court]] Act 1981 that allows for police appeals, which will not be prosecuted if done in reasonable terms.
* If it is in the [[public interest]] to identify them, as a warning to others who may commit a similar offence. Especially if an [[ASBO]] has been issued to the convicted offender, as the publicity is essential to its enforcement. However, it is worth noting that ASBOs are being abolished, as of 2010.

These only apply once proceedings are activated by an arrest or a summons issued.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43174">[[File:Eirene Ploutos Glyptothek Munich 219 n1.jpg|thumb|The Greek goddess [[Eirene (goddess)|Eirene]], personification of peace, holds [[Plutos]], the god of wealth, in her arms (Roman copy of a statue by [[Cephisodotus the Elder|Cephisodotus]]; [[Athens]] c. 370 BC]]
The idea of the '''Common Peace''' (Κοινὴ Εἰρήνη, ''Koinē Eirēnē'') was one of the most influential concepts of 4th century BC Greek political thought, along with the idea of [[Panhellenism]]. The term described both the concept of a desirable, permanent peace between the Greek city-states ([[polis|poleis]]) and a sort of [[peace treaty]] which fulfilled the three fundamental criteria of this concept: it had to include all the Greek city-states, it had to recognise the [[autonomy]] and equality of all city states without regard for their military power, and it had to be intended to remain in force permanently.

The advocates of the Common Peace saw it as a way to end the endemic warfare which engulfed the Greek ''poleis'' from the outbreak of the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431 BC. From the [[Peace of Antalcidas|King's Peace]] of 387/6 BC down to the foundation of the [[League of Corinth]] in 338 BC, the idea of the Common Peace influenced all peace treaties between Greek ''poleis''. In the end, however, it turned out that only a strong [[hegemony|hegemonic power]] could maintain a comprehensive peace for long. In modern times, the concept has been revived and in the 20th century, the principle of the Common Peace was a foundation stone of international organisations like the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]].

== The idea of the Common Peace ==
The idea of the Common Peace developed out of older ideas which had gradually taken form in the political interactions of the 5th century BC in Greece. Its temporary enforcement however owes less to the realisation of the need for a permanent peace, than to the fact that it seemed to serve the interests of several successive hegemonic powers. The history of the Common Peace is therefore not only part of the [[history of ideas]], but also of the diplomatic history of Greece in the decades between the Peloponnesian War and the arrival of king [[Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Alexander the Great]].

=== Development of the term===
[[File:Helmed Hoplite Sparta.JPG|thumb|Spartan [[hoplite]]]]
The [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''Eirene'', which originally only signified a 'state of peace', developed the related meaning of 'peace agreement' at the beginning of the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Diekhoff, ''Friedensreden'', p. 379–391&lt;/ref&gt; This was a consequence of a change in attitudes to war and peace more generally. Already in the 5th century BC, wars between Greek ''poleis'' were ended with treaties, which were known as ''spondai'' (σπονδαί), ''synthekai'' (συνθήκαι) or ''dialyseis polemou'' (διάλυσεις πολέμου). All these terms ultimately only indicated a truce or temporary break from war.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, ''Koine Eirene'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; But as a result of the unending warfare from the middle of that century, the idea gradually developed that a state of peace rather than war should be the normal state of international affairs. This is reflected in the increased prominence of the term ''Eirene'' and in its use as a term for peace treaties.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Diodorus]], XV.5.1 and XV.38.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'Common Peace' was first used in 391 BC, in reference to the failed negotiations between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]] to end the [[Corinthian War]]. The Athenian politician [[Andocides]] advised his fellow citizens in a speech for the acceptance of a settlement which he called ''koine eirene''.&lt;ref&gt;Andokides, ''Orations'' III.17&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly the term had already come into general parlance before this, but this speech is the first attestation. The first treaty in which the terms ''eirene'' and ''koine eirene'' were actually used was the 'King's Peace' imposed by the Spartans and [[Achaemenids|Persians]] in 387/6 BC. The phrase ''koine eirene'' only appears in an official document for the first time in the peace treaty made after the [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]] in 362 BC.

Generally, the term ''koine eirene'' is only sparsely attested in contemporary sources. Authors like [[Isocrates]], [[Demosthenes]] and [[Xenophon]] do not use it at all. But they do refer to its essential characteristics for each of the peace treaties which the 1st century BC historian [[Diodorus]] consistently refers to as a ''koine eirene''. The fact that Diodorus based his account of the period from 386 to 361 on the contemporary author [[Ephorus]] makes it very likely that the term was in general use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, ''Koine Eirene'', S. 11–13&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears in mid-4th century BC inscription from [[Argos]], known as the [[Reply to the Satraps]], whose exact date and circumstances are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;''IG'' IV 556&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Characteristics ===
In the speech of Andocides and the provisions of the King's Peace&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'' V.1.31&lt;/ref&gt; two characteristics are revealed which were new for peace treaties at this time. One of these was that all Greek ''poleis'' (with a few exceptions) were to be autonomous. The other was that each of these draft treaties were sent to all ''poleis''. Peace is therefore no longer presented as a bilateral agreement between two formerly hostile ''poleis'' or leagues, but as a multilateral treaty, which would also encompass all the parties that were not involved in the conflict, as far as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Jehne, ''Koine Eirene'', pp. 39 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third characteristic is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the absence of set time limit. In the 5th century, it was the norm for peace treaties to have a specified period of validity. The [[Thirty Years' Peace]] of 446/5 BC between Athens and Sparta was named for the period of time it was expected to last. The [[Peace of Nicias]] of 421 BC was meant to last for fifty years, while treaties with a set period of one hundred years were practically intended to last forever. This derives from the idea that peace was not being made between the states as such, but rather between their populations, and thus the longest possible period of time that a treaty could last was the lifetime of a single generation - which could only make agreements for itself, not its descendants. By contrast, a ''koine eirene'' was in principle designed to endure forever.&lt;ref&gt;Jehne, ''Koine Eirene'', p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was not actually explicitly stated in the treaties, it is clear from the internal logic of the autonomy clauses, since an independence with chronological limits would not be independence.

==== Multilaterality ====
The bilateral peace treaties of the 5th century BC between Athens and Sparta largely ignored the interests of other parties - including their own allies, who were not even consulted. Even the treaty of 404 BC, which ended the Peloponnesian War and was in practice a diktat from the Spartan side, was formally a treaty between Sparta and Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Baltrusch: ''Symmachie'', pp. 23 f.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not contain any terms regarding the allies of Athens in the [[Delian League]] and was actually concluded despite the opposition of the Spartans' allies. The treaty therefore entirely reflects the conditions and ideas of the 5th century, in which there were only two major hegemonic powers in Greece, to which all other ''poleis'' were subordinated.
[[File:Pericles Pio-Clementino Inv269 n3.jpg|thumb|Bust of Pericles]]
The idea of a multilateral panhellenic agreement was not actually new, however. After the defeat of [[Persian Wars|Xerxes' invasion]], a general peace had been concluded in 481, although it was temporary. In 450 BC, [[Pericles]] is reported to have desired to convene a general peace conference in Athens. It is reported that the refusal of the Spartans to participate on account of their fear of Athenian hegemony meant that it never actually took place. Apart from some multilateral treaties between individual ''poleis'' in [[Sicily]] and [[Ionia]], the religious association of the [[Amphictyonic League]] was the only multilateral agreement of ancient Greece which was enduring and significant. The Amphictyonic oath forswore the destruction of member states in war or the removal of their water. ''Poleis'' that broke this oath would themselves be threatened with destruction. This might be a forerunner of the ''koine eirene''.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, ''Koine eirene'', pp. 3–6 &amp; Ehrenberg, ''Staat'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

That it became ever more common to make peace treaties on the basis of a ''koine eirene'' after 387 BC had a practical aspect. The successive hegemonial powers were not individual ''poleis'', but several opposing ''poleis'' or leagues of roughly equal strength. With them, peace was only possible if all agreed together. For the general acceptance of such a multilateral agreement, the autonomy clause was the first requirement.

==== Autonomy clause ====
The Greek term ''autonomia'' signified the right and ability of the citizens of a ''polis'' to use their own legal system or ''nomos'' (νόμος) and to be free from all submission to other ''poleis''.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, ''Staat'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''polis'' had become the characteristic form of the state in Greece, there was an unwritten law in their relationships with one another that each of them - even the most insignificant ones - should be autonomous. The only exceptions to this were the small cities of [[Attica]] and [[Laconia]], which hadlong been completely integrated into the Athenian and Spartan ''poleis''. It was a source of substantial tension in the 4th century, when the [[Thebans]] attempted to incorporate the cities of [[Boeotia]] into a single ''polis'' in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, ''Koine eirene'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Persian Wars, however, the willingness to form leagues, called ''koina'' or ''symmachiai'' under the leadership of a hegemonic power or ''hegemon'' increased. These were entered into voluntarily, so that the principle of autonomy was theoretically not infringed. But as the Persian threat declined in significance, it seemed that the Athenians wished to convert the Delian League which they controlled into a naval empire which they ruled. Thus the Athenians violated the foundations of ''autonomia'': the freedom of ''poleis'' to live under their own political systems, to be free of [[garrison]]s, [[cleruchy|cleruchies]], external legal jurisdiction, and tribute. The introduction of ''phoros'' (φόρος, i.e. contributions for military purposes), the relocation of league's treasury from [[Delos]] to Athens and the forced introduction of [[Athenian democracy|democratic]] constitutions based on the Athenian model in some members of the league all seemed to violate the principle of ''autonomia''.

The Spartans, whose [[Peloponnesian League]] was comparatively loosely organised, began to use the demand for ''autonomia'' as a diplomatic means to weaken the Athenian league from the middle of the 5th century BC. The took up the complaints of the Athenians' allies as their own: during and after the Peloponnesian War, the Spartans presented themselves as the protectors of the freedom of all Greek states. Thus the autonomy clause was not only a key component of every Common Peace because smaller ''poleis'' saw it as a way to ensure their independence,&lt;ref&gt;Pistorius, ''Hegemoniestreben'', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; but also and more importantly because larger powers could use it to advance their own interests.

==Development of the Common Peace==
Whether a peace agreement was a Common Peace or not is uncertain for some treaties. In the following, a wide definition is used in order to make the development of the idea of the Common Peace clear. Criteria for inclusion are the autonomy clause and the permission for all Greek poleis to join, regardless of whether that option was actually taken up.

=== Failed peace of 391 BC===
In 392/1 BC, in the course of the [[Corinthian War]], Sparta submitted an initial peace offer to the [[Achaemenid|Persian]] [[satrap]] of [[Lydia]], [[Tiribazus]]. The Spartans were under pressure to extract themselves from their hopeless war in [[Asia Minor]] and simultaneously reassert their military supremacy in mainland Greece. For this it was necessary, firstly, to concede Persian control of the Greek cities of [[Ionia]], and, secondly, to end the Persians' alliances with the Greek opponents of Sparta, especially Athens. Simultaneously, the [[Great King]] needed to be convinced that no new Greek power would form in the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean]] which might challenge Persian control of the Ionian cities.

The agreement that would solve all these problems was that Sparta and Persia would guarantee the autonomy of all Greek states (exceptthose in Asia Minor). The Spartans would then have been able to point to the protection of a generally recognised principle as the outcome of the war. At the same time, this would allow the Spartans to split the Greek world into a number of weak individual states, ensuring the Spartan hegemony and satisfying the Persian desire for security. The Greek city-states naturally rejected the treaty out of hand. The Persian king [[Artaxerxes II]] was also inclined to reject it. He recalled Tiribazus and replaced him with a new satrap, [[Struthas]], who strengthened the Persian alliance with Athens.

A few months later, the Spartans attempted to come to terms with their Greek enemies in a conference in their own city. Once more, they made the autonomy principle the basis of any agreement, this time with concessions to Athens and Thebes. The Athenians would have retained the islands of [[Lemnos]], [[Imbros]], and [[Skyros]], while the Thebans' possession of [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]] would have been recognised.

It was during these negotiations that the formula of a 'Common Peace' for all Greeks was first used. The Athenian orator Andocides used it in a speech, in which he vainly urged his countrymen to accept the Spartan offer:
{{quote|Consider this too, Athenians: right now you are negotiating peace and freedom common to all the Greeks and causing everyone to share control over everything.|Andokides, ''On the Peace'' 17}}
Andokides makes a distinction between treaties and a real peace. He invoked the panhellenic ideal, while idealising the project of the common peace. As he did this, however, he omitted the fact that the Ionian cities for whose freedom Athens had gone to war with Persia some hundred years earlier, would be abandoned as a result of this treaty. In the end the Athenians rejected the treaty because of this (and because after their alliance with [[Struthas]], they believed they were in a stronger position).

===Peace of Antalcidas===
[[File:Xenophon.jpg|thumb|150px|Xenophon]]
{{main|Peace of Antalcidas}}
The successes of the Athenian fleet in 390 BC, however, led to a reevaluation at the Persian court, which did not want the Athenians to get too strong. Struthas was replaced two years later by his predecessor [[Tiribazus]], who negotiated a peace with the Spartan envoy [[Antalcidas]]. The resulting agreement, known as the 'Peace of Antalcidas' or the 'King's Peace' essentially accepted the Spartan proposals of 392/1. The most important terms were the inclusion of all Greek states and the guarantee of their freedom and autonomy. Only the Ionian cities, [[Cyprus]] and [[Clazomenae]], which remained under Persian control, and the three aforementioned islands under Athenian rule were excluded. The Athenians had to surrender all other possessions and the dissolution of all leagues was the unavoidable consequence of the treaty. The key passage comes from [[Xenophon]], whose [[Hellenica]] is the most important source for this period:
{{quote|Artaxerxes the king thinks it is just that the cities in Asia be his as well as the islands of Clazomenae and Cyprus, but that all the Greek cities great and small should be allowed to be autonomous, except for Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros, which should be Athenian, as of old. And if anybody does not accept this peace, I will go to war against them, with those who want these things, on foot and by sea, with ships and with money.|Xenophon, ''Hellenica'' 5.1.31}}

Most scholars see the Peace of Antalcidas as the first example of a common peace. [[Hermann Bengtson]] viewed the common peace as a side-effect of the treaty, which was originally only a decree of the Great King (from which it derives its name).&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, ''Griechische Geschichte.'' p.&amp;nbsp;271.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spartans were appointed as guardians (''prostatai'') of the peace, with the power to interpret and enforce its provisions. All the Greek states swore to abide by this decree at Sparta - in light of the Great King's threat to go to war with anyone who refused to do so. This fact and the aforementioned exceptions show that a common peace was not fully achieved. Nor would one be achieved subsequently. While the autonomy and the inclusion of all cities was guaranteed, they were entirely dependent on the interests of those same powers which initiated and guaranteed the common peace.

Artaxerxes did not intend to provide Greece with an enduring peace, but to divide and weaken it politically. The Spartans displayed a desire for peace, but also a wish to ensure their own hegemony. The Spartan interpretation of autonomy required the dissolution of all leagues except their own [[Peloponnesian League]],&lt;ref&gt;On the problem of the definition of autonomy, see Pistorius, ''Hegemoniestreben'', pp. 165–167&lt;/ref&gt; since this was not unified or centrally organised, but instead was a system of bilateral treaties which the Spartans had made with each individual member. In the Spartan view, bilateral treaties between individual states were not included in the ban on leagues controlled by a hegemonic power, although in practice this is exactly what the Peloponnesian League was.

Therefore, the Spartans remained the strongest military power in Greece. Under the pretext of protecting the autonomy principle, they maintained a hegemonic position over the next few years which greatly abused the autonomy of other states, such as the [[Chalcidian League]] and the city of [[Mantinea]].

=== The Common Peace of 375 BC ===
In 382 BC, the Spartans seized the [[Cadmea]], the citadel of Thebes, whose increasing strength was a thorn in their side. This act costed them the rest of their credit as protectors of autonomy and led to the [[Boeotian War]] with the Thebans and their Athenian allies. In the course of this, in spring 377 BC, the [[Second Athenian Confederacy]] was established. This league represented a violation of the clauses of the Peace of Antalcidas. But it is possible that a majority of the Aegean islands and coastal states now saw Athens as a better advocate of the principle of autonomy, as a result of their support for the Thebans. The league treaty was explicitly concluded:
{{quote|for the good fortune of the Athenians and the allies of the Athenians: so that the Spartans shall allow the Greeks 10 to be free and autonomous and to live at peace, possessing securely all their own (territory), &lt;nowiki&gt;[[and so that [the peace and the friendship which the Greeks] and the King [swore] shall be in force [and endure] in accordance with the 15 agreements]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Rhodes &amp; Osborne, ''Greek Historical Inscriptions 404-323 BC'' (2007), no 22.}}

The Athenians had thus taken clever advantage of the situation and the restoration of the naval confederacy clearly brought with it the undertaking to maintain the King's Peace. It had taken less than thirty years of Spartan hegemony to reverse attitudes on the Athenian empire. The first league had been presented as a threat to autonomy, but the second was claimed to be its protector. In order to prevent the Athenians from reassuming a hegemonic position, the new league was organised in accordance with the principles of the common peace. This is a sign that these principles were generally accepted by this time.

When the war with Sparta stagnated in 375 BC, the a willingness to make peace developed in Sparta and Athens. The Spartans could no longer hope for a victory and the Athenians had achieved their goals: the freedom of Thebes from Spartan control and the recognition of the sea league as compatible with the terms of the Peace of Antalcidas. [[Diodorus]] reports an embassy of the Great King came to secure a renewal of the peace, since the Persians needed peace in Greece in order to free the mercenaries up for a war they wanted to undertake in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus 15.38.1&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek states accepted the agreement and the Common Peace was renewed.

At this point, the Common Peace was extended in one respect: as already foreseen in the terms of the Second Athenian Confederacy, it was required that all foreign garrisons be removed from all cities. This was directed particularly at the Spartans who had garrisons in some south [[Boeotia]]n cities, such as [[Thespiae]] (actually at their request, as protection against the Thebans). The Thebans were thus the main beneficiaries of the Common Peace of 375. The Spartans had begun the war on the same grounds that the Athenians now wished to end it: to prevent the further growth of Theban power. However, in the end the departure of the Spartan troops on the pretext of the autonomy principle left the Thebans with a free hand in Boeotia. Even so, the Athenians were clearly on the winning side: their success lay in the recognition of a new confederacy. Neither the Spartans nor the Persians could do anything about this, as they had done ten years earlier.

Despite the Persian diplomatic involvement, the Common Peace of 375 can be seen as the first which derived principally from Greek initiative and in which all parties were of roughly equal strength and thus received equal terms. For the first time, a peaceful system seemed to be possible without enforcement by a hegemonic power.

=== Failed negotiations of 371 BC ===
Two opposing political groups had already developed in Athens before the treaty of 375 BC: one sought an agreement with Sparta, the other a strengthening of the alliance with Thebes. However, the anti-Spartan forces over-estimated Athens' position after the peace and supported a democratic insurgency against the government of the island of [[Corcyra]], which was allied with Sparta. Thus the Spartans, who were anything but satisfied with the result of the preceding clashes, already had grounds to go back to war a year and a half after the peace. At the same time, the situation was further complicated by the fact that Thebes destroyed the city of [[Plataea]] in 374/3 BC, which had an ancient alliance with Athens and had also been allied with Sparta since 380 BC. The Spartans therefore sent troops to [[Phokis]], to threaten Thebes and undo the failures of the preceding years. Thus, 371 BC once more saw the outbreak of a general conflict.

In Athens, however, the moderate politicians considered the best outcome for their city to lie in a policy of neutrality and proposed a new common peace. To support Thebes would decisively strengthen their position. Support of Sparta, on the other hand, would have alarmed their allies, who say them as a threat to their right to autonomy. Further factors were also relevant: if the Spartans refused the proposed league, the Athenians would have been forced to fight two wars at once. Therefore, the Athenians decided to overlook the fate of Plataea and invited the Thebans to a peace conference in Sparta. The Spartans were even more willing to make peace now, since their actions in Phocis had been unsuccessful. Threatening Thebes thus became unlikely, but the Spartans did not consider themselves to be in any danger.

The common peace which was now proposed at the initiative of the Athenians, again saw critical innovation. The Athenian interpretation of autonomy prevailed and according to Xenophon, the Spartans committed to removing all their [[harmost]]s from cities of the peace.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 6.18–19&lt;/ref&gt; This was a difficult situation, since after 375 BC, only the cities in the Peloponnese (Sparta's chief area of influence) were relevant. Even more important for the continued development of idea of peace were rules which provided for all sides to demobilise their troops and fleets and which allowed the treaty partners to help one another in the event of an attack. The final clause, which did not impose a duty to help, was included at Athenian request. They intended to use it later to maintain the possibility of holding the balance of power between the other two powers.

Considered in isolation, this peace treaty could be taken as a skilled piece of Athenian diplomacy. But since it never actually came into effect, it can only be speculated whether it could have formed the basis of an enduring peace. After all, the treaty partners had taken account of the idea that sufficient force needed to be made available for use against potential treaty breakers in order to maintain the peace. In the Peace of Antalcidas, this had been accomplished by the threat of the Great King. In an agreement between free states, it had to be an agreement to oppose an attack on a treaty partner together.

At the planned swearing of the treaty, however, a serious rift arose between Thebes and Sparta. The Theban envoys had initially sworn to the agreement in the name of their own city and allowed that name to be placed on the treaty. But the next day, they demanded that the name of Thebes be replaced with that of the [[Boeotian League]], since they claimed to be entitled to represent it. The Spartans categorically rejected this, since in their view the Boeotian cities ought to be autonomous. The split led to war and only twenty days later, the [[Battle of Leuctra]] took place, which proved to be the first Spartan defeat in open battle and decisively altered the balance of power in Greece in Thebes' favour.

[[File:Griechenland 371-362.jpg|thumb|400px|Greece during the [[Theban Hegemony]], 371–362 BC.]]

After the battle, military activity ceased. At first, the Thebans undertook no further military action against the Spartans, who eventually sent troops to the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] to ward off any chance of a Theban attack on the Peloponnese. In this situation, the Athenians seized the initiative and called a peace conference, at which they could swear to the common peace once more and negotiate a new treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 6.5.2-3&lt;/ref&gt; This was motivated by the desire to prevent further increase in Theban power. An innovation in this new peace treaty was that the possibility of aiding a treaty partner in attacking a disturber of the peace was transformed into a duty. This was a logical development of the previous failed peace and was found at the start of all future common peace treaties. Some researchers see the second treaty of 371 as the foundation of a military alliance (''symmachia''), as a result of this duty to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Ernst Mayer in the review of Hampl, ''Staatsverträge'', in [[Zeitschrift der Savigny-Stiftung für Rechtsgeschichte|Zeitschrift für Rechtsgeschichte]], Romanische Abteilung 59 (1938), pp. 598–606&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spartans joined this new agreement immediately for their own sake. Their neighbours, the [[Elis|Eleans]] had already sought to take advantage of the defeat of Sparta in the meanwhile and they refused to recognise the autonomy of some of their border cities, which they had given up in 399 BC under Spartan compulsion, but had retaken after Leuctra.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 6.5.3&lt;/ref&gt; Fatally, the Thebans did not agree to the treaty, since a common peace was inconsistent with their ambitions for their newly won hegemony. H. Bengtson saw this common peace as nothing more than an Athenian "gesture against Thebes, without practical value."&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, ''Geschichte'', p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

If the idea of the Common Peace had any chance to be based on equal rights for all states, it was in the short period between 375 BC and the Battle of Leuctra. Only then were there three Greek powers of roughly equal strength such that the strongest could be controlled by an alliance of the other two. Before and after this there was a clearly dominant hegemonic power (first Sparta, then Thebes) which either sought to use the common peace for their own purposes or rejected it altogether. Both approaches led to further military conflict. With the failure of the negotiations of 371 BC, the concept of the common peace largely lost credence as part of a practical policy.

===Peace treaties of 368 and 366 BC ===
In the year after Leuctra, the Thebans clearly established their hegemony. Through a campaign into the Peloponnese, they established the independence of the [[Messenians]], who had been ruled by the Spartans for centuries, and supported the establishment of the [[Arcadian League]]. A further war against an alliance of Sparta, Athens and [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]] proved inconclusive. Thus in 369/8 BC, all the Greek states responded to the call to meet in a peace conference at [[Delphi]], issued by [[Ariobarzanes of Phrygia|Ariobarzanes]], the satrap of [[Phrygia]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, Hellenica 7.1.27&lt;/ref&gt; However, the negotiations foundered in the face of the Spartans' refusal to accept Messenian independence - a position which was supported by the Athenians and by the Persian representative, Philiscus. Since Ariobarzanes went into rebellion against the Great King a little later, it is not entirely clear whether he was acting on the king's orders or in accordance with his own interests.&lt;ref&gt;See Ryder, ''Koine Eirene'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of further clashes, [[Dionysius II of Syracuse]] withdrew his aid from the Spartans, leading them to turn to the Persians for assistance once more. Thus, in 367/6 BC, Greek envoyse to the court of the Great king engaged in what the ancient historian [[Karl Julius Beloch]] referred to as the ''Wettkriechen'' (wager-creep), in which the Theban [[Pelopidas]] was ultimately successful. The Persians now recognised Thebes as the organising power in Greece in the same way that they had recognised Sparta in the King's Peace twenty years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ryder |first=T. T. B. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1957 |month= |title=The Supposed Common Peace of 366/5 BC |journal=The Classical Quarterly |volume=7 |issue=3/4 |pages=199–205 |doi=10.1017/S0009838800015275|quote= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |jstor= 637462 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henceforth, the Messenians were to be independent from Sparta and [[Amphipolis]] from Athens, while the [[Elis|Eleans]] were granted the neighbouring area of [[Triphylia]]. Furthermore, all armies and the fleet of the Athenians were to be reduced in size.

This attempt at a common peace was rejected by Sparta and Athens. The Thebans did not manage to enthuse other city-states with the agreement either. These two attempts at a common peace under Theban hegemony represent a return to the idea of peace presented in 387 BC: the Persians attempted to use the influence of a Greek hegemonic power to force a common peace. That both attempts, unlike the King's Peace, were rejected is a result of the fact that the Great King had lost power as a peacebroker, as a result of the revolt of Ariobarzanes and other satraps. The most important reason for the course of events, however, may have been the experiences of the Greek cities with Paris after the King's Peace.

=== The Common Peace of 362 ===
Due to the growing Theban pressure on Athens (such as the seizure of [[Oropus]] in 366 BC), the Athenians became hostile once more, especially when actual help from their allies failed to materialise. None of the Greek states were able to gain full dominance in the following years. The conflict arising from the split in the Arkadian League also remained unresolved. This culminated in 362 BC with the [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]], in which the Spartans, Athenians and their allies faced down the Thebans and their allies. After the battle, in which the foremost Theban commander [[Epaminondas]] was killed, both sides considered themselves the victors and again concluded a common peace.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus 15.89.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time, the agreement was reached neither at the instigation of one of more leading powers, nor as a result of the power of the Persian king. In this and in the refusal of the Greek states to support the [[Great Satraps' Revolt]] against the Persian king in Asia Minor, many scholars have seen a positive element.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Taeger, ''Friede'', pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt; According to this viewpoint, the Greeks had managed to control themselves and establish a peace on their own. The opposing view is that the basis of this new common peace was simply the military and economic exhaustion of all parties, which also made an intervention in Asia Minor completely unthinkable.&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, ''Geschichte'', S. 385 f.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The terms of the agreement particularly indicate that they arose from widespread war weariness and a desire to make peace as quickly as possible. They allowed each state to hold whatever they actually possessed at the time when the treaty was concluded. Territorial conflicts were not resolved at all - they no longer even posed an obstacle to agreement. The Arcadian League remained split into a northern and a southern half and the Messenians continued to be independent. Since half the land owned by the Spartans lay within Messenia, they did not accede to this common peace, but they were in no condition to carry on the war.

=== The Common Peace as the basis of the League of Corinth ===
[[File:Demosthenes2.jpg|thumb|Demosthenes]]
{{main|League of Corinth}}
After Mantinea, Greek politics continued along the same lines as before. When conflict with the rising power of [[Philip II of Macedon]] became more intense in the 350s, the idea of the Common Peace was revived once more. Philip first made the suggestion of replacing the [[Peace of Philocrates]] which had ended the [[Third Sacred War]] with a common peace. In the next few years, [[Demosthenes]] and other advocates of a decidedly anti-Macedonian approach gained preeminence in Athens. They rejected the proposal and called for war against Philip of Macedon. In 340/39 BC, the Athenians successfully brought together an alliance of Greek states, but their forces were decisively defeated by Philip at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] in 338 BC.

The Macedonians reacted harshly only against the Thebans, wishing instead to take advantage of the power of Athens and the other states by means of a league. The treaty establishing this league contained an express ban on interfering in the constitutions of other states by force (essentially an autonomy clause) and general bans on conflict and piracy for the first time, as well as a guarantee of free navigation. Only the Spartans refused to join this league. The other states were to send representatives, who would meet in a [[synedrion]] (council). They then entered into a personal alliance with Philip II, making him the Hegemon of the League.

Theoretically, the freedom and autonomy of the Greek state were thus assured. In practice, however, the general ban on conflict marked a striking limitation on independence. In addition, the Macedonians retained garrisons in the [[Cadmea]] of Thebes, the [[Acrocorinth]], and at [[Chalcis]] - ostensibly to maintain the common peace.

The League of Corinth therefore marked the end of the Common Peace as the foundation for full equality between states and linked the idea of peace strongly with the guarantee of a hegemonic power once more. The alliance and the common peace were interlinked in the league treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, ''Staat'', pp. 146 &amp; 322&amp;nbsp;f.&lt;/ref&gt; The Panhellenic idea of a unified Greece and a campaign of vengeance against Persia were enabled by this Common Peace.

==Reasons for failure==
With 'autonomy and freedom' the Greek states at the beginning of the fourth century found a formula for a inclusive peace system which was acceptable to all sides. After 387 BC no peace was possible without it, even if the individual attempts only held for a few years each. However, the principles of the common peace also found their way into league treaties, such as the Second Athenian Sea League and the League of Corinth. A major opportunity for the development of a true Common Peace lay in the fact that the peace idea proved flexible enough to be developed further in this way.

Scholars like [[Bengtson]] take the view that the Greek city states did not have enough time before the establishment of the Macedonian hegemony, to fully adopt the Common Peace as an instrument of peace and as the foundations of a new order in the Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, ''Geschichte'', S. 255&lt;/ref&gt; The best chance for an enduring peace on the basis of equality between city states was probably missed with the failure of the Common Peace of 371 BC. Nine years later, after the Battle of Mantinea, a Common Peace was seen only as a compromise solution. The revival of the concept by Philip of Macedon was undertaken only in the interests of Macedonian power, as it had previously been used to support the interests of Persia, Sparta, Athens, and Thebes.

A major aspect of the failure of the Common Peace lay in the formulation of the concept itself, especially the broad interpretation of the autonomy clause.&lt;ref&gt;Ebenda, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; The mutual control of Greek states by one another was only possible at the beginning of the fourth century. The idea that any limitations of the ability to wage war were restrictions on freedom and autonomy made any system of peace almost certain to fail.

The leaders of the city-states were aware that good will alone was not enough to guarantee a Common Peace. Depending on the political situation, they developed mechanisms of enforcement to prevent disturbances of the peace. They gradually came to the conclusion that a common peace on the basis of equal rights for all states was only possible if all participants were to immediately come to the aid of any member of the alliance under attack. This assumed a roughly equal balance of power between the Greek states, which actually only existed for a short period between 375 BC and the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC. Before and after these dates, a Common Peace would only have had a chance if a strong guaranteeing power was prepared to provide military support to the agreement as necessary.

==Afterlife==
The principles of the Common Peace developed by the Greeks in the fourth century BC, only developed once more in Europe in the 17th century when they became the basis for enduring peace agreements and systems. Thus, the [[Peace of Westphalia]] was the first European peace agreement in modern times to be based on priniciples of the equality of sovereign states and on the inviolability of their internal affairs - that is, on the idea of autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, ''Krieg''; S. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|Perpetual Peace]]'' of 1795, [[Immanuel Kant]] went one step further. He advocated not only the principle of non-intervention, but also called for a ''Volkerbund'' (People's league). In order to end the lawless natural situation between states, this would establish a federal relationship between them, in a manner similar to the common peace proposed after the Battle of Leuctra.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, ''Frieden'', pp 19 &amp; 30 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's ideas were appealed to in the twentieth century by the founders of the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]].

{{Conflict of laws}}
{{Family law}}

'''Conflict of marriage laws''' is the [[conflict of laws]] with respect to [[marriage]] in different jurisdictions. When marriage-related issues arise between couples with diverse backgrounds, questions as to which legal systems and norms should be applied to the relationship naturally follow with various potentially applicable systems frequently conflicting with one another.

==The choice of law==
The standard [[choice of law]] rules for adjudicating on issues relating to marriage represent a balance between the various public policies of the laws involved:

===Status and capacity===
[[status (law)|Status]] and [[capacity (law)|capacity]] are defined by the personal laws of the parties, namely:

* the ''[[lex domicilii]]'' or law of the [[domicile (law)|domicile]] in [[common law]] states, and
* either the ''[[lex patriae]]'' or law of [[nationality]], or law of [[habitual residence]] in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] states).

The personal laws will usually define status [[in rem]] so that it is recognised wherever the individual may travel subject only to significant public policy limits. Hence, for example, as an aspect of ''[[parens patriae]]'', a state will define the age at which a person may marry. If such a limitation could simply be [[evasion (law)|evaded]] by the young person traveling abroad on a holiday to a country with a lower age limit, this would clearly breach the policy of the "parental" state. The same principle would apply to an adult who wished to create a [[polygamous]] marriage or to evade a restriction on [[consanguinity]]. In [[Family Law]] as opposed to [[contract (conflict)|the Law of Contract]], there is also a strong case for legal capacity to be universally enforced to limit to ability of individuals to evade normally mandatory rules. The claims of the ''[[lex loci celebrationis]]'' to apply are weak given that the significance of the location may be no more than the convenience of their laws to those wishing to marry.

===Validity of the marriage===
# The form of the marriage is governed by the ''lex loci celebrationis'' or the law of the place where the marriage was celebrated or occurred, and is usually considered definitive on whether the ceremony or legal recognition has been effective to create the relationship of marriage and marital rights (see [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]]).
# The validity of the marriage is governed by the capacity of the parties to marry each other. Capacity to become a spouse is usually governed by the domicile of the parties. Thus for example, a 13-year-old does not have the capacity to marry in England, but does have that capacity in Nigeria (Northern Muslim Community). Likewise, in Canada no person can be "sanctioned" to have multiple spouses.

===''Lex fori''===
The ''[[lex fori]],'' or proper jurisdiction to adjudicate legal disputes, will usually be the state where the spouses have sought to make their matrimonial home. This state will usually have a clear and direct interest in the applications of its policies to regulate the nature of relationships permitted to confer the status of husband and wife within their territorial boundaries. It may also attempt to regulate the behavior of those who wish to cohabit within their territory although this may contravene [[privacy]] rights.

===Religion===
Where worshippers wish to marry according to the tenets of their religion, the state must decide whether that ceremony will be effective to create a valid marriage. For example, the government may decide whether a clergy has sufficient authority to declare marriage or whether a civil ceremony will be required. Alternatively, certain governments only consider a civil marriage celebration as legally binding and regard the religious ceremony as a "confirmation" of the civil marriage.

In [[Islam]], marriage is a contract between the bride and groom (or their proxies) known as a ''[[nikah]]''. Some Islamic couples only go through a ''nikah'' ceremony and do not register the marriage with the civil authorities or go through a civil ceremony. When such a relationship breaks down, the wife is left without state protection{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} that would normally be available if the marriage had been registered according to civil law. The situation is exacerbated if the husband refuses to grant a [[talaq (conflict)|talaq]] and also refuses to make any provision. In states where there is no [[Sharia]] Court, the affected individuals' only recourse would be to the local civil courts, but [[jurisdiction]] would be difficult to invoke except under the [[parens patriae]] provisions to protect the [[best interests]] of any children. As to transnational marriages, there is no reason in principle why religious ceremonies effective under the ''lex loci celebrationis'' should not create marriages recognized as valid everywhere.

===Custom===
In many states, culturally separate communities have retained their own traditions. A developing modern state had to determine whether it should recognize such traditions as it was establishing a centralized system of law. In [[South Africa]], for example, the ''Recognition of Customary Marriages Act'' 1999 retrospectively recognizes as valid all customary marriages so long as they are registered. Further, s2(3) of the Act provides that, if a person has entered into more than one customary law marriage, all valid marriages entered into before the commencement of the Act, are recognized. The Act similarly recognizes all customary marriages entered into after the commencement of the Act where the High Court approves a written contract regulating the future matrimonial property systems for marriages (both present and prospective spouses must be joined in the application).

Such measure represented a major shift, because custom marriages were often potentially or actually polygamous as against public policy, and were not recognized under the new law. The government reversed the position, as it realized that it was impossible to enforce the prohibition against polygamy and wives usually consented.

Where a state has produced a formal body of law to control recognition, this will establish a general framework under which international recognition can be managed. Where there is no formal rule within the ''lex loci celebrationis'', a forum court could hear expert evidence on whether the marriage would be accepted as effective (see the public policy of ''favor matrimonii'' which creates a [[rebuttable presumption]] in favor of the validity of any marriage) but it will be difficult for the parties to justify their failure to comply with the local laws that unambiguously would have created a valid marriage.

===Common law===
In some states, the legal acceptability of [[common law marriage]] is very limited. Some couples, whether because there are no local formalities relevant to them or because they have strongly held prejudices against compliance with the local forms, decide to create a marriage either by a simple public exchange of vows (''per verbis inter praesentes''), or by habit and repute. Because the need for conformity between states requires respect for the legal systems, it is now very difficult to identify states with no local system for the celebration and registration of marriages, and even more difficult for the courts of one state to justify a decision to support the prejudices of two of its citizens against the laws of the second state. However, other states permit informal marriages to acquire legal status and, where this happens, there is no reason in principle why international recognition should not follow.

Canada allows married persons to retain multiple spouses in legally recognized family law, but only in one province. Saskatchewan utilizes S.51 of their Family Property Act to "sanction and assist in the creation" of polygamous unions. To date, that province has only allowed married women to become spouses in family property law of single men; however their Family Law Act and case laws are the only statutes and references in North America where a legal jurisdiction promotes polygamy. Common law marriages in Canada have been referred to for over forty years as a form of marriage or "conjugal union". Since 1999, Saskatchewan has allowed married persons to have more than one "simultaneous" conjugal union in family property law.

===Government registration===
In some countries, the registration of a marriage means that it cannot later be declared invalid, since it has been accepted by the government. In Taiwan, which follows a variation of the Napoleonic Code (received by way of Japan), the presumption is that each country maintains a central registry of its citizens, including their marital status. If a Taiwan citizen marries in another country, however, this information may not find its way into the records. Many thousands of ROC soldiers who came to Taiwan in 1949 left behind wives in mainland China, but married local Taiwanese women. Since the two polities did not share records, the result was a pattern of legally recognized second marriages, despite the ban on polygamy by both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Today, foreigners wishing to marry Taiwan citizens must present letters from their countries' representative offices testifying that they are not already married. (Of course a determined bigamist might marry in some third country.) In the case of countries which lack centralized family records (such as the USA), a notarized affidavit is accepted.

==The age of marriage==
Different minimum age requirements also can lead to problems in mutual recognition of marriages. A marriage of young children is in some countries deemed to be against the ordre public, minimum ages for recognition are sometimes set (which may vary from the minimum ages for marriage itself). For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], the Immigration Rules 1986 were introduced to bar persons under the age of 16 from entering the UK in reliance upon their [[status (law)|status]] as a spouse. Nevertheless, for other purposes, such marriages will be recognized as valid so long as the parties had the relevant capacity under their personal laws and the ceremony was effective under the ''lex loci celebrationis'' to create a valid marriage.

==Consent==
In Western cultures, other than the age of consent, the issue of consent is also considered of fundamental importance and, if it is not freely given, it can prevent a valid marriage from ever coming into existence: see [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]]. In Canada, "common law marriages" do not require consent to be recognized and often a stipulated "passage of time in eligible cohabitation" is the only requisite to becoming a formally recognized "marriage". The "capacity to marry" includes the fundamental ''a priori'' reasoning that both persons must not be married to others (the exception is Saskatchewan Canada).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The only stipulation to this rule of thumb is that both partners must be eligible to marry in the first place.  In Islamic law, a ''nikah'' contract is not valid if the parties do not consent, although there are differences in juristic opinion about exactly how the consent can be manifested. This supposed lack of clarity has led some Western cultures to question the general morality of "arranged marriages", often stigmatizing the system as being open to abuse and sometimes leading to forced marriages. In the English case of ''Szechter v Szechter'', Sir Jocelyn Simon P. said that for duress to vitiate a valid marriage, it must be proved that:

* the will of one of the parties had been overborne by a genuine and reasonably held fear;
* this fear was caused by a threat of immediate danger for which the party was not himself or herself responsible, usually amounting to a threat of physical or fatal injury, or false imprisonment.

The test requiring an immediate danger never matched the practical realities facing individuals where the consequences of a refusal to marry might not be immediate, but nevertheless serious. In ''Hirani v Hirani'' (1982) 4 FLR 332, the Court of Appeal considered the case of a nineteen-year-old Hindu woman who was dating a Muslim man. Her parents told the petitioner that unless she married a Hindu of their choosing, she would be ostracized socially from her family and left to fend for herself. Under the circumstances, the Court agreed that the petitioner had acted without full consent in marrying her parents' choice of husband. Thus, it is for the courts of all countries to strike a balance between well-intentioned parental authority to arrange marriages in the face of a reluctant child, and unreasonable threats that would overbear the will of any reasonable person, while maintaining the trust of local communities whose cultures have included arranged marriages for centuries. As to transnational recognition, it will be difficult to disturb the validity of the marriage if no complaint of coercion was made around the time the ceremony was performed in the ''lex loci celebrationis'' or immediately the parties entered the state where proceedings were commenced. It would be more usual to use the local divorce system to terminate the relationship.

==Consanguinity==
In Christian cultures, the Biblical proscriptions contained in Leviticus 18 v6–18, are used as the basis for restricting marriage between persons who are deemed to be too closely related to each other. More generally, the restrictions fall into two classes (and based on Old Testament laws):

* where the parties are related by blood ([[consanguinity]]); or
* where parties are related by marriage ([[Affinity (law)|affinity]]).

Several exceptions have been described for various Biblical figures, incestuous relationships such as Abraham and Sarah,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+20:11-12&amp;version=31|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 20:11-12 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nachor and Melcha,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11:26-29;&amp;version=31|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 11:26-29 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lot and his Daughters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+19:31-36;&amp;version=31|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 19:31-36 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Amram and Jochebed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+6:19-20;&amp;version=31|title=Bible Gateway passage: Exodus 6:19-20 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limitations based on consanguinity derive from a policy of practical [[eugenics]] and reflect the increased possibility that such marriages will produce children with a genetic defect due to the limitations on their combined gene pool. The limitations based on affinity, by contrast, are predominantly legal and social in origin. The rules relating to affinity reflect the need to minimise the prospects of familial jealousies and dysfunction by preventing the intermarriage of people already related by marriage. Difficult questions arise on whether an adopted child may marry his or her adoptive parents, or the natural children of the adoptive parents. No matter what legislative decisions are taken, there will always be citizens who wish to evade the application of the law. There will be no problem if they relocate and establish a matrimonial home in a state that allows their marriage. But any attempt to evade such laws by going through a ceremony in a state that permits the marriage and then returning to the original state (which will usually be their state of domicile, nationality or habitual residence) will fail, and may even expose the couple to the risk of prosecution for [[incest]] or an equivalent offense.

==Polygamy==
Polygamy may be [[polygyny]] (one man having more than one wife at the same time) or [[polyandry]] (one woman having more than one husband at the same time) and it has been practiced sparsely throughout history in almost all cultures and sanctioned by various religions where necessary to meet population or economic needs. For example, when disease, war or famine has reduced populations, the taking of several wives has been the solution to restoring population. In some economically poor areas where infant mortality is high but children are a vital source of labor to maintain the earning capacity of the family, polygamy provides more children. Some states have defined marriage as the union of one man to one woman "to the exclusion of all others" and, in some cases, have criminalized [[bigamy]] or, as in [[Canada]], have made polygamy an offense under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]. Under section 293(a) of the Canadian Criminal Code, everyone who enters into any form of polygamy or any "conjugal union with more than one person at a time" is guilty of an offense, and under s. 293(b), there is a separate offense for any person who "celebrates, assists or is a party to a rite that sanctions a polygamous marriage".&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states refer to the current religious practices within their territories as the test for legal acceptability: for example, the ''Marriage Law 1974'' (no. 1/74) in [[Indonesia]] does not prohibit polygamy for those religions that allow it (i.e. Islam, [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]]), but permits it with the consent of the existing wife or wives if:

* there is proof of sufficient financial capacity to maintain all spouses and children;
* there are safeguards that husband will treat his wives and children equally; and
* a court is satisfied that there are valid reasons for wishing to contract a polygamous marriage (e.g., that the existing wife is infertile, has an incurable disease, etc.).

The converse is to be found in the [[halakhah]] and the [[Talmud]] where the general principle is that, "a woman cannot be the wife of two [men]" (Kid. 7a and Rashi). For a wife, the term ''kiddushin'' implies her exclusive dedication to her husband and there can be no ''kiddushin'' between her and another man while the first ''kiddushin'' subsists. Any purported marriage to another man is thus formally invalid but, nevertheless, requires a ''get'' to terminate it. A married man may celebrate a second marriage (and any others) unless he has specifically undertaken to his first wife, e.g., in the ''ketubbah'', not to do so, or monogamy is the local custom. Thus, [[Ashkenazic]] Jews who live in Christian nations accepted a ''takkanah'' (a [[rabbi]]nic law not deriving from the Talmud) banning polygamy in c. 1000 CE, while [[Sephardic]] Jews who live in Islamic societies have not followed this law.

===Actually polygamous===
At the time a secular court considers the validity of this marriage, there are already multiple spouses. In English law, for example, §2 Immigration Act 1988 prohibits certain polygamous wives from exercising their [[right of abode]] with the result that any application from such a wife has to be considered in accordance with paragraphs 278 to 280 of the [[Immigration Rules]], which contain provisions to restrict settlement in most cases to one wife. But, for less controversial purposes, most states are willing to recognise actually polygamous marriages as valid so long as the parties had the capacity to enter into such relationships and the ceremonies were effective under the ''lex loci celebrationis''. In '''Canada''', Ontario province recognizes polygamous marriages if they occurred in a foreign country whom Canada recognizes as permitting polygamy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Same-sex marriage==

In a Chinese conception of marriage, a marriage is defined as being a relationship in which unions of various surnames are established in order to increase the lines of succession and property values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDN-WdK_OoUC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=|title=The Chinese Family System|first=Sing Ging|last=Su|date=1 August 2008|publisher=BiblioBazaar|accessdate=19 February 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most countries in 2015, do not recognize marriage between two people of the same sex.

In the late 20th century, rites of marriage for same-sex couples without legal recognition became increasingly common. The first law providing for marriage of people of the same sex in modern times was enacted in 2001 in the [[Netherlands]]. {{As of|2017|05|02}}, same-sex marriage is legally recognized (nationwide or in some parts) in the following countries: [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]], [[Same-sex marriage in Colombia|Colombia]], [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]],&lt;ref group="nb" name="Denmark"&gt;Including [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark proper]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Greenland|Greenland]].

Some tribal jurisdictions do not recognize same-sex marriage. In the United States, Congress (not the federal courts) has legal authority over Indian country. Thus, unless Congress passes a law regarding same-sex marriage for Indian tribes, federally recognized American Indian tribes have the legal right to form their own marriage laws.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]].

In 21 countries worldwide and in several US Counties and/or Cities, a same-sex couple can be legally partnered in a [[civil union]], [[domestic partnership]] or [[registered partnership]]. Couples in these unions or partnerships are afforded rights and obligations similar to, but not identical to, those of a married couple.

On the issue of [[legal aspects of transsexualism|transsexualism]], the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in ''Goodwin v UK'' and ''I v UK'' (July 2002) concluded that there is no justification for barring a transsexual from enjoying the right to marry. In ''Bellinger v Bellinger'' [2003] UKHL 21, (2003) Times, 11 April the English courts held that the non-recognition of change of gender for the purposes of marriage in s 11(c) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 was incompatible with Convention rights. But the House of Lords did not consider that the issues raised in the case were suitable for determination by courts and left the matter for Parliament, which has now enacted the [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] and matches the majority of European states in permitting marriage in the adoptive gender role. The same rights may be allowed in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and some other states.

{{Politics of Ecuador}}

The '''Constitutional Tribunal of Ecuador''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] Tribunal Constitucional del Ecuador) is the highest court in [[Ecuador]] dealing with constitutional issues. It was created as part of Ecuador's 1996 constitutional reform package. It is composed of nine [[magistrates]].

The Constitutional Tribunal has been affected by Ecuador's recent political crises. In 2005, President [[Lucio Gutiérrez]] manipulated his party's modest advantage in [[National Congress of Ecuador|Congress]] to replace numerous justices, including eight of nine members of the Constitutional Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Ecuador faces institutional crisis | publisher=[[Transparency International]] | date = February 2005 | url = http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2005/crisis_ecuador1 | accessdate = 2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Tribunal was involved in a confrontation with newly elected President [[Rafael Correa]]. On March 9, the Tribunal warned Correa that he would be acting illegally if he ignored its eventual ruling on the constitutionality of a national referendum. Correa responded that the Tribunal was "dominated by the political parties" and that it had no authority to act on the issue.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] on 18 and 19 December 2005. Voters were asked whether they approved of a  proposed new [[Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|constitution]]. It was approved by 84% of voters, with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006|first elections]] held under the new constitution in 2006.

==Background==
The constitution was approved by the [[Senate (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|Senate]] and  [[National Assembly (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|National Assembly]] after being agreed by all factions involved in the [[Second Congo War]]. It was then required to be put to a referendum.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4546535.stm New DR Congo constitution backed] BBC News, 14 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; If approved, it would replace a transitional constitution in place since 2002.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;

==Proposed constitution==
The new constitution introduced a two-term limit on the presidency and a minimum age of 30 for presidential candidates (reduced from 35),&lt;ref name=BBC3&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4534794.stm Q&amp;A: DR Congo vote] BBC News, 16 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the incumbent President [[Joseph Kabila]] to run for office.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; It also granted citizenship to all ethnic groups present in the country at the time of independence in 1960 and increased the number of [[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|provinces]] from 10 to 26, as well as guaranteeing free primary education.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;

==Conduct==
The referendum was originally scheduled to be held on 17 December, but ran into a second day due to issues with heavy rain and incomplete voter rolls.&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt; Observers from the [[European Union]] said the poll was "largely free and fair" and that the atmosphere at the time of the referendum was peaceful.&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4544918.stm DR Congo 'backs new constitution'] BBC New, 21 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7710">The '''doctrine of parity''' was used to justify agricultural [[price controls]] in the United States beginning in the 1920s. It was the belief that farming should be as profitable as it was between 1909 and 1914, an era of high food prices and farm prosperity. The doctrine sought to restore the "terms of trade" enjoyed by farmers in those years. It was highly controversial, since critics argued it ignored changes in agricultural productivity and set an artificial standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boulding|first=K.E.|title=Economic Analysis and Agricultural Policy|journal=Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science|date=August 1947|volume=13|series=3|pages=439–440|jstor=137769}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Defining Moment: The Great Depression and the American Economy in the Twentieth Century|year=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|author=Libecap, Gary D.|editor1=Michael Bordo |editor2=Claudia Goldin |editor3=Eugene White |url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c6893.pdf?new_window=1|page=185|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine developed in the 1920s as food prices declined after the First World War. The first attempt at instituting the parity doctrine was the [[McNary-Haugen Bill]], vetoed by President [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1928. Farming prices decreased further during the [[Great Depression]], leading to parity-seeking [[New Deal]] era legislation, such as the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933]].&lt;ref&gt;Libecap, pg. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Political pressure to enforce parity declined after the 1940s and 1950s as commodity prices rose. However, New Deal programs remained in place, and agricultural price regulations were still regularly introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Libecap, pg. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background: the "Golden Age" of farming==

American farm commodity prices rose throughout the 19th century. Even when occasional declines and farmer complaints occurred, like in the mid-1880s, the federal government only intervened through tariffs, anti-trust laws, and small measures to spur demand. There was no conscious effort to bring prices to an “ideal” level. In the early 1910s, commodity prices rose even further, and by 1914, farm prices were at their highest level in a century. The prosperous 5-10 year period before 1914 is often referred to as the “Golden Age” of agriculture, and the relative price level of this time would set the standard for “parity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bean|first=L.H.|author2=P.H. Bollinger|title=The Base Period for Parity Prices|journal=Journal of Farm Economics|date=Feb 1939|volume=21|issue=1|pages=253|jstor=1230643}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Libecap, pg. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

America’s involvement in the [[First World War]] in 1917 spurred the first large-scale federal intervention in the farm commodities market. Out of wartime necessity, the government allowed executive regulation of agricultural production and requisitioned food supplies. This wartime intervention, though not implemented with the intention of aiding farmers, would lay the foundation for later regulations. After the war, prices declined; 1921 saw a particularly sharp drop. During this period, the first organized farm lobbies were created.&lt;ref&gt;Libecap, pg.186&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parity efforts before 1933==

As political pressure rose, the McNary-Haugen Bill was introduced in Congress in January 1924. The bill would control US agriculture prices by having the federal government purchase excess supply. A fund of $200 million would be created for such a purpose. The target prices would be computed monthly by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], and would be real-price equivalents of those in the 1905-1914 period. The bill passed Congress in 1928, but was vetoed by President [[Calvin Coolidge]].&lt;ref&gt;Libecap, pg.188&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the political pressure, 1924-1929 farm commodity prices were, on average, only 5 percent lower than in the 1909-1914 parity period. In 1929-1933, however, farm prices declined much further. Between 1919 and 1933, wholesale agricultural prices declined by 67 percent, with most of this drop occurring after 1929. In 1930 alone, farm commodity prices declined by 37 percent. The Hoover administration passed the Agricultural Marketing Act in 1929, which introduced limited supply controls, but the price decline continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Regulated Economy: A Historical Approach to Political Economy|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|author1=Elizabeth Hoffman  |author2=Gary Libecap |lastauthoramp=yes |editor1=Claudia Goldin |editor2=Gary Libecap |url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c6576.pdf?new_window=1|page=189|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fausold|first=Martin|title=President Hoover's Farm Policies 1929-1933|journal=Agricultural History|date=April 1977|volume=51|issue=2|pages=372|jstor=3741165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The New Deal==

In light of this decline, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] passed  the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933. This plan imposed acreage limitations on farmers in return for federal benefit payments. By limiting supply, the Act explicitly sought to raise prices and reestablish the relative purchasing power of farmers that had prevailed from 1909 to 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Libecap, pg. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

These efforts did raise prices; but by 1938 the farm commodity price ratio was still at only 77 percent of pre-war parity. In 1940, agricultural prices were only 65 percent of 1929 prices. Throughout 1940, the ratio of agricultural prices to general prices remained well below that of the 1909&amp;ndash;1914 era.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman and Libecap, pg. 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bean and Bollinger, pg. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1940 the priorities of the federal government shifted to wartime needs. Civilian demand was no longer incentivized, and supply was stimulated. Following the war, however, New-Deal-era programs continued, and parity prices were continually recalculated throughout the following decades. After 1948, parity-prices were linked to the relationships among farm and nonfarm prices during the most recent 10-year period, rather than only on the 1909&amp;ndash;1914 benchmark, thereby adjusting for changes in relative productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Libecap, pg. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowers|first=Douglas|author2=Wayne Rasmussen|author3=Gladys Baker|title=History of Agricultural Price-Support and Adjustment Programs, 1933-84|journal=Agriculture Information Bulletin No. 485|date=Dec 1984|pages=18|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/aib485/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The doctrine of parity was politically controversial, particularly in the 1930s and 1940s. Proponents believed the period from 1909 to 1914 had represented a desirable "dynamic" equilibrium between the industrial and manufacturing sectors of the economy. They pointed to the era's low unemployment and industrial stability. The departure from this ideal was blamed on World War I's massive distortions.&lt;ref&gt;Bean and Bollinger, pg. 253-254&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics countered that the parity doctrine was based on political, not economic, arguments. They said it ignored changes in relative productivity. For instance, if productivity in agriculture (relative to the 1909&amp;ndash;1914 base period) rose faster than in industry, the parity price would be too high, and ''vice versa''. They argued the relative price structure of one period would quickly become obsolete as technology progresses at different paces in each economic sector.&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, pg. 439&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Singer]] ([[Princeton University]] and [[University of Melbourne]] professor and pioneer of the [[animal liberation movement]]) has long argued that, if it is possible to survive and be healthy without eating meat, fish, [[Dairy product|dairy]], or [[Egg (food)|eggs]], one ought to choose that option instead of causing unnecessary harm to animals. In ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'', Singer argued that, because non-human animals feel, they should be treated according to [[utilitarianism|utilitarian ethics]]. Singer's work has since been widely built upon by philosophers, both those who agree&lt;ref name="Hodder &amp; Stoughton"&gt;[[Mark Rowlands]] (2013). ''Animal rights: All that matters''. [http://www.allthatmattersbooks.com/book/animal-rights-all-that-matters Hodder &amp; Stoughton]&lt;/ref&gt; and those who do not,&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Scruton]] (2006) ''Animal rights and wrongs'' [http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/animal-rights-and-wrongs-9781441199157/ Bloomsbury Publishing]&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been applied by animal rights advocates&lt;ref&gt;Sue Donaldson &amp; [[Will Kymlicka]]. (2011). ''Zoopolis: A political theory of animal rights''. [https://www.amazon.com/Zoopolis-Political-Theory-Animal-Rights/dp/0199599661 Oxford University Press].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by ethical vegetarians and [[Veganism|vegans]].

Ethical vegetarians say that the reasons for not hurting or killing animals are similar to the reasons for not hurting or killing humans. They argue that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be justified in extreme circumstances; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is not justifiable. Some ethicists have added that humans, unlike other animals, are morally conscious of their behavior and have a choice; this is why there are laws governing human behavior, and why it is subject to moral standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why the Naive Argument against Moral Vegetarianism Really is Naive|journal=Environmental Values|year=2001|pages=103–112|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.3197/096327101129340769|author=David Benatar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical vegetarian concerns have become more widespread in developed countries, particularly because of the spread of factory farming, more open and graphic documentation of what human meat-eating entails for the animal,&lt;ref&gt;Eisnitz, G. A. (2009). ''Slaughterhouse: The shocking story of greed, neglect, and inhumane treatment inside the US meat industry''. [http://www.meat.org.uk/slaught.html Prometheus Books]. Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; and environmental consciousness. Some proponents of meat-eating argue that the current mass demand for meat has to be satisfied with a mass-production system, regardless of the welfare of animals. Less radical proponents argue that practices like well-managed [[Free range|free-range]] rearing and the consumption of hunted animals, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could satisfy the demand for mass-produced meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pluhar | first1 = E.

Some have described unequal treatment of humans and animals as a form of [[speciesism]] such as [[anthropocentrism]] or human-centeredness. [[Val Plumwood]] (1993, 1996) has argued that anthropocentrism plays a role in green theory that is analogous to [[androcentrism]] in feminist theory and [[ethnocentrism]] in anti-racist theory. Plumwood calls human-centredness "anthropocentrism" to emphasize this parallel. By analogy with [[racism]] and [[sexism]], [[Melanie Joy]] has dubbed meat-eating "[[carnism]]". The [[animal rights movement]] seeks an end to the rigid moral and legal distinction drawn between human and non-human animals, an end to the status of animals as property, and an end to their use in the [[animal testing|research]], food, [[Fur farming|clothing]], and entertainment industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animalsarenotobjects.ca|title=Manifesto for the Evolution of Animals’ Legal Status in the Civil Code of Quebec|author=|date=|website=animalsarenotobjects.ca|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140621194408/http://animalsarenotobjects.ca/|archive-date=21 June 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10771361/Pets-no-longer-just-part-of-furniture-in-France.html "Pets no longer just part of furniture in France"]. ''The Telegraph''. 16 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Singer, in his ethical philosophy of [[personism|what it is to be a "person"]], argues that [[livestock]] animals feel enough to deserve better treatment than they receive. Many thinkers have questioned the morality not only of the double standard underlying speciesism but also the double standard underlying the fact that people support treatment of cows, pigs, and chickens that they would never allow with pet dogs, cats, or birds.&lt;ref name="Hodder &amp; Stoughton"/&gt;

Jay Bost, [[Agroecology|agroecologist]] and winner of ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} essay contest on the ethics of eating meat, summarized his argument in the following way: "eating meat raised in specific circumstances is ethical; eating meat raised in other circumstances is unethical" in regard to environmental usage. He proposes that if "ethical is defined as living in the most ecologically benign way, then in fairly specific circumstances, of which each eater must educate himself, eating meat is ethical." The specific circumstances he mentions include using animals to cycle nutrients and convert sun to food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bost|first=Jay|title=Give Thanks for Meat|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/magazine/the-ethicist-contest-winner-give-thanks-for-meat.html?_r=1&amp;|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethicists like [[Tom Regan]] and Peter Singer define "ethical" in terms of [[suffering]] rather than [[ecology]]. [[Mark Rowlands]] argues that the real determinant of whether it is ethical to cause suffering is whether there is any ''vital need'' to cause it; if not, then causing it is unethical.&lt;ref name="Hodder &amp; Stoughton"/&gt;

[[Ethology|Ethologist]] [[Jane Goodall]] stated in the 2009 book ''The Inner World of Farm Animals'' that "farm animals feel pleasure and sadness, excitement and resentment, depression, fear and pain. They are much more sensitive and intelligent than we ever imagined."&lt;ref&gt;Goodall J (April 2009), ''The Inner World of Farm Animals''. Stewart, Tabori and Chang.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a group of well known [[neuroscientist]]s&lt;ref&gt;May 2013. "Here Come the Animals". ''Psychology Tomorrow Magazine''. Retrieved 8 November 2014 from http://www.psychologytomorrowmagazine.com/animal-consciousness-jeff-warren/&lt;/ref&gt; stated in the "Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness in Non-Human Animals" that all mammals and birds (such as farm animals), and other animals, possess the neurological substrates that generate consciousness and are able to experience affective states.&lt;ref&gt;Low P, Panksepp J, Reiss D, Edelman D, Van Swinderen B, Koch C (July 2012). "The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugene Linden (author)|Eugene Linden]], author of ''The Parrot's Lament'', suggests that many examples of animal behavior and intelligence seem to indicate both emotion and a level of consciousness that we would normally ascribe only to our own species.

Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] counters:

{{quote|Consciousness requires a certain kind of informational organization that does not seem to be "hard-wired" in humans, but is instilled by human culture. Moreover, consciousness is not a black-or-white, all-or-nothing type of phenomenon, as is often assumed. The differences between humans and other species are so great that speculations about animal consciousness seem ungrounded. Many authors simply assume that an animal like a bat has a point of view, but there seems to be little interest in exploring the details involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Dennett|first= Daniel C|date= 1995|title= Animal consciousness: what matters and why|url= http://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/dennett_anim_csness.html|journal= [[Social Research]]|publisher= |volume= 62|issue= 3|pages= |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosophers [[Peter Singer]] (Princeton), [[Jeff McMahan (philosopher)|Jeff McMahan]] (Oxford) and others also counter that the issue is not one of consciousness, but of [[sentience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMahan|first1=Jeff|title=The Ethics of Killing|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pain===
{{main|Pain in animals}}
{{See also|Pain in invertebrates}}
A related argument revolves around non-human organisms' ability to feel pain. If animals could be shown to suffer, as humans do, then many of the arguments against human suffering could be extended to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carter | first1 = Alan | year = 2005 | title = Animals, Pain and Morality | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Philosophy | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 17–22 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-5930.2005.00289.x | pmid=15948329}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such reaction is [[transmarginal inhibition]], a phenomenon observed in humans and some animals akin to [[mental breakdown]].

As noted by John Webster (emeritus professor of [[animal husbandry]] at the [[University of Bristol]]):
{{quote|People have assumed that intelligence is linked to the ability to suffer and that because animals have smaller brains they suffer less than humans. That is a pathetic piece of logic, sentient animals have the capacity to experience pleasure and are motivated to seek it, you only have to watch how cows and lambs both seek and enjoy pleasure when they lie with their heads raised to the sun on a perfect English summer's day. Just like humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1502933,00.html "The secret life of moody cows"], John Webster.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Influences on views of animal consciousness ===

When people choose to do things about which they are ambivalent and which they would have difficulty justifying, they experience a state of [[cognitive dissonance]], which can lead to [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]], [[denial]], or even [[self-deception]]. For example, a 2011 experiment found that, when the harm that their meat-eating causes animals is explicitly brought to people's attention, they tend to rate those animals as possessing fewer mental capacities compared to when the harm is not brought to their attention. This is especially evident when people expect to eat meat in the near future. Such denial makes it less uncomfortable for people to eat animals. The data suggest that people who consume meat go to great lengths to try to resolve these moral inconsistencies between their beliefs and behaviour by adjusting their beliefs about what animals are capable of feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Bastian|first= Brock|last2= Loughnan|first2= Steve|last3= Haslam|first3= Nick|last4= Radke|first4= Helena R.

Some people choose to be vegetarian or vegan for environmental reasons.

According to a 2006 report by LEAD ''[[Livestock's Long Shadow]]'', "the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global."&lt;ref name=Livestock&gt;{{Citation |last= Steinfeld|first= Henning|last2= Gerber|first2= Pierre|last3= Wassenaar|first3= Tom|last4= Castel|first4= Vincent|last5= Rosales|first5= Mauricio|last6= de Haan|first6= Cees|year= 2006|title= Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options|publisher= FAO|publication-place= Rome|page= |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/climatechange/doc/FAO%20report%20executive%20summary.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The livestock sector is probably the largest source of water pollution (due to animal wastes, fertilizers, and pesticides), contributing to [[eutrophication]], human health problems, and the emergence of [[Antibiotics#Resistance|antibiotic resistance]].

There are also environmentalist arguments in favor of the morality of eating meat. One such line of argument holds that sentience and individual welfare are less important to morality than the greater ecological good. Following environmentalist [[Aldo Leopold]]'s principle that the sole criterion for morality is preserving the "integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community", this position asserts that sustainable hunting and animal agriculture are environmentally healthy and therefore good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Callicott|first1=J.

==Religious traditions of eating meat==
{{Main|Vegetarianism and religion}}

[[Hinduism]] holds vegetarianism as an ideal for three reasons: the principle of nonviolence ([[ahimsa]]) applied to animals; the intention to offer only "pure" (vegetarian) or [[sattva|sattvic]] food to a deity and then to receive it back as [[prasad]]; and the conviction that an insentient diet is beneficial for a healthy body and mind and that non-vegetarian food is detrimental for the mind and for spiritual development. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] vegetarianism has similar strictures against hurting animals. The actual practices of Hindus and Buddhists vary according to their community and according to regional traditions. [[Jain vegetarianism|Jains]] are especially rigorous about not harming sentient organisms.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

[[Sharia|Islamic Law]] and [[Judaism]] have dietary guidelines called [[Halal]] and [[Kashrut]], respectively. In Judaism, meat that may be consumed according to ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) is termed ''[[kosher]]''; meat that is not compliant with Jewish law is called ''[[treif]]''. Causing unnecessary pain to animals is prohibited by the principle of [[tza'ar ba'alei chayim]]. While it is neither required nor prohibited for Jews to eat meat, a number of medieval scholars of Judaism, such as [[Joseph Albo]] and [[Isaac Arama]], regard [[Jewish vegetarianism|vegetarianism]] as a moral ideal.

In [[Christianity]] as practised by members of [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Greek Catholic Church]], and others, it is prohibited to eat meat in times of [[fasting]]. Rules of fasting also vary. There are also [[Christian vegetarianism|Christian monastic orders that practice vegetarianism]].

==Criticisms and responses==

===Morals===
It has been argued that a [[moral community]] requires all participants to be able to make moral decisions, but animals are incapable of making moral choices (e.g., a tiger would not refrain from eating a human because it was morally wrong; it would decide whether to attack based on its survival needs, as dictated by hunger). Thus, some opponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that the analogy between killing animals and killing people is misleading.&lt;ref name="Hsiao" /&gt; For example, Hsiao (2015) compares the moral severity of harming animals to that of picking a flower or introducing [[malware]] into a computer.&lt;ref name=Hsiao&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hsiao|first1=Timothy|title=In Defense of Eating Meat|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics|date=2015|volume=28|pages=277–291|doi=10.1007/s10806-015-9534-2|url=https://www.academia.edu/6986943/In_Defense_of_Eating_Meat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that humans are capable of culture, innovation, and the [[wikt:sublimation|sublimation]] of instinct in order to act in an ethical manner while animals are not, and so are unequal to humans on a moral level. This does not excuse cruelty, but it implies animals are not morally equivalent to humans and do not possess the rights a human has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/anim-eth/#SH2b |title=Animals and Ethics |publisher=University of Tennessee |date=2 August 2013 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise definition of a moral community is not simple, but Hsiao defines membership by the ability to know one's own good and that of other members, and to be able to grasp this in the abstract. He claims that non-human animals do not meet this standard.&lt;ref name="Hsiao" /&gt;

[[Benjamin Franklin]] describes his conversion to vegetarianism in chapter one of his autobiography, but then he describes why he (periodically) ceased vegetarianism in his later life:
{{quote|...in my first voyage from Boston...our people set about catching cod, and hauled up a great many. Hitherto I had stuck to my resolution of not eating animal food... But I had formerly been a great lover of fish, and, when this came hot out of the frying-pan, it smelt admirably well. I balanc'd some time between principle and inclination, till I recollected that, when the fish were opened, I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then thought I, "If you eat one another, I don't see why we mayn't eat you." So I din'd upon cod very heartily, and continued to eat with other people, returning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet. So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlyamerica.com/lives/franklin/chapt4/ |title=The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin - Chapter 4 |publisher=Earlyamerica.com |date=27 February 2007 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Various programs operate in the US that promote the notion that animals raised for food can be treated humanely. Some spokespeople for the factory farming industry argue that the animals are better off in total confinement. For example, according to F J "Sonny" Faison, president of Carroll's Foods:
{{quote|They're in state-of-the-art confinement facilities. The conditions that we keep these animals in are much more humane than when they were out in the field. Today they're in housing that is environmentally controlled in many respects. And the feed is right there for them all the time, and water, fresh water. They're looked after in some of the best conditions, because the healthier and [more] content that animal, the better it grows. So we're very interested in their well-being up to an extent.&lt;ref name=Scully255&gt;Scully, Matthew. ''Dominion'', St. Martin's Griffin, 2002, pp. 255–256.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response, animal welfare advocates ask for evidence that any factory-bred animal is better off caged than free.&lt;ref&gt;Matheny, G., &amp; Leahy, C. (2007). [http://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Farm-Animal-Welfare-Legislation-and-Trade.pdf Farm-animal welfare, legislation, and trade]. ''Law and contemporary problems'', 325-358.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Farm Sanctuary]] argue that commodifying and [[Animal slaughter|slaughtering animals]] is incompatible with the definition of "humane".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spot.humaneresearch.org/content/truth-behind-labels-farm-animal-welfare-standards-and-labeling-practices The Truth Behind The Labels: Farm Animal Welfare Standards and Labeling Practices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106041409/http://spot.humaneresearch.org/content/truth-behind-labels-farm-animal-welfare-standards-and-labeling-practices |date=6 January 2014 }} Farm Sanctuary&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Animal ethics|Animal ethicists]] such as [[Gary Francione]] have argued that reducing animal suffering is not enough; it needs to be made [[animal law|illegal]] and [[abolitionism (animal rights)|abolished]].

===Non-chordates===
Peter Singer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=Animal Liberation, A New Ethics for our Treatment of Animals|year=1975|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out that the ethical argument for vegetarianism may not apply to all non-vegetarian food. For example, any arguments against causing pain to animals would not apply to animals that do not feel pain. It has also often been noted that, while it takes a lot more grain to feed some animals such as cows for human consumption than it takes to feed a human directly, not all animals consume land plants (or other animals that consume land plants). For example, [[oyster]]s consume underwater plankton and algae. In 2010, Christopher Cox wrote:

{{quote|Biologically, oysters are not in the plant kingdom, but when it comes to [[ethical eating]], they are almost indistinguishable from plants. Oyster farms account for 95 percent of all oyster consumption and have a minimal negative impact on their ecosystems; there are even nonprofit projects devoted to cultivating oysters as a way to improve water quality. Since so many oysters are farmed, there's little danger of overfishing. No forests are cleared for oysters, no fertilizer is needed, and no grain goes to waste to feed them—they have a diet of plankton, which is about as close to the bottom of the food chain as you can get. Oyster cultivation also avoids many of the negative side effects of plant agriculture: There are no bees needed to pollinate oysters, no pesticides required to kill off other insects, and for the most part, oyster farms operate without the collateral damage of accidentally killing other animals during harvesting.&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2010/04/consider_the_oyster.html "It's OK for vegans to eat oysters"], Christopher Cox, 2010, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cox went on to suggest that oysters would be acceptable to eat, even by strict ethical criteria, if they did not feel: "while you could give them the benefit of the doubt, you could also say that unless some new evidence of a capacity for pain emerges, the doubt is so slight that there is no good reason for avoiding eating sustainably produced oysters." Cox has added that, although he believes in some of the ethical reasons for vegetarianism, he is not strictly a vegan or even a vegetarian because he consumes oysters.

===Animal and plant pain===
Critics of ethical vegetarianism say that there is no agreement on where to draw the line between organisms that can and cannot feel. Justin Leiber, a philosophy professor at [[Oxford University]], writes that:
{{quote|[[Montaigne]] is ecumenical in this respect, claiming consciousness for spiders and ants, and even writing of our duties to trees and plants. Singer and [[Samuel Clarke|Clarke]] agree in denying consciousness to sponges. Singer locates the distinction somewhere between the shrimp and the oyster. He, with rather considerable convenience for one who is thundering hard accusations at others, slides by the case of insects and spiders and bacteria, they pace Montaigne, apparently and rather conveniently do not feel pain. The intrepid Midgley, on the other hand, seems willing to speculate about the subjective experience of tapeworms ...[[Thomas Nagel|Nagel]] ... appears to draw the line at flounders and wasps, though more recently he speaks of the inner life of cockroaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leiber | first1 = Justin | year = 1988 | title = 'Cartesian Linguistics?' | url = | journal = Philosophia | volume = 118 | issue = | pages = 309–46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are also some who argue that, although only suffering animals feel anguish, plants, like all organisms, have evolved mechanisms for survival. No living organism can be described as "wanting" to die for another organism's sustenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/science/22angi.html?_r=0|title=Sorry, Vegans: Brussels Sprouts Like to Live, Too|publisher=New York Times|author=Natalie Angier|date=21 December 2009|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article written for ''The New York Times'', Carol Kaesuk Yoon argues that:

{{quote|When a plant is wounded, its body immediately kicks into protection mode. It releases a bouquet of volatile chemicals, which in some cases have been shown to induce neighboring plants to pre-emptively step up their own chemical defenses and in other cases to lure in predators of the beasts that may be causing the damage to the plants. Inside the plant, repair systems are engaged and defenses are mounted, the molecular details of which scientists are still working out, but which involve signaling molecules coursing through the body to rally the cellular troops, even the enlisting of the genome itself, which begins churning out defense-related proteins ... If you think about it, though, why would we expect any organism to lie down and die for our dinner? Organisms have evolved to do everything in their power to avoid being extinguished. How long would any lineage be likely to last if its members effectively didn't care if you killed them?&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/science/15food.html?pagewanted=all "No Face, but Plants Like Life Too"], Carol Kaesuk Yoon, ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Animals killed in crop harvesting===
Steven Davis, a professor of [[animal science]] at [[Oregon State University]], argues that the least harm principle does not require giving up all meat. Davis states that a diet containing beef from grass-fed ruminants such as cattle would kill fewer animals than a vegetarian diet, particularly when one takes into account animals killed by agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002888,00.html |title= Should we all be vegetarians? |date= 2 July 2002|accessdate=14 June 2010 | work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This conclusion has been criticized by [[Jason Gaverick Matheny]] (founder of [[in vitro meat|''in vitro'' meat]] organization [[New Harvest]]) because it calculates the number of animals killed per acre (instead of per consumer). Matheny says that, when the numbers are adjusted, Davis' argument shows veganism as perpetrating the least harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1026354906892|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics|last=Matheny|first=G|volume=16|issue=5|pages=505–511|title=Least Harm: A Defense of Vegetarianism from Steven Davis's Omnivorous Proposal|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis' argument has also been criticized by Andy Lamey for being based on only two studies that may not represent commercial agricultural practices. When differentiating between animals killed by farm machinery and those killed by other animals, he says that the studies again show veganism to do the "least harm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamey |first=Andy |year=2007 |title=Food Fight!

==Non-meat products==
[[File:Indiapoultry.JPG|thumb|Egg-laying chickens in [[battery cage]]s]]
One of the main differences between a vegan and a [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|typical vegetarian diet]] is the avoidance of both eggs and dairy products such as milk, cheese, butter, and yogurt. [[Veganism#Ethical veganism|Ethical vegans]] do not consume dairy or eggs because they believe their production causes animal suffering or premature death.&lt;ref name=marcus&gt;{{cite book|title=Vegan: The New Ethics of Eating|author=Erik Marcus|year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hHjqs43t8oC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To produce milk from [[dairy cattle]], most calves are separated from their mothers soon after birth and fed milk replacement in order to retain the cows' milk for human consumption.&lt;ref name=milk&gt;{{cite web|title=Dairy Cows &amp; Welfare |author=[[Vegetarian Society]]|date=|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal welfare advocates point out that this breaks the natural bond between the mother and her calf.&lt;ref name=milk /&gt; Unwanted male calves are either slaughtered at birth or sent for veal production.&lt;ref name=milk /&gt; To prolong [[lactation]], dairy cows are almost permanently kept pregnant through [[artificial insemination]].&lt;ref name=milk /&gt; Although cows' natural life expectancy is about twenty years,&lt;ref name=marcus /&gt; after about five years the cows' milk production has dropped; they are then considered "spent" and are sent to slaughter for meat and [[leather]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vache à lait : dix mythes de l’industrie laitière|date=2013|publisher=Editions Stanké, Québec|url=http://livres.edesaulniers.com/?product=vache-a-lait-dix-mythes-de-lindustrie-laitiere|author=Desaulniers, Élise|authorlink=Élise Desaulniers|accessdate=19 May 2014|language=French|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061132/http://livres.edesaulniers.com/?product=vache-a-lait-dix-mythes-de-lindustrie-laitiere|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23439">'''Extradition law in the United States''' is the formal process by which a fugitive found in the [[United States]] is surrendered to another country or state for trial or punishment. For foreign countries, the process is regulated by treaty and conducted between the [[federal government of the United States]] and the government of a foreign country. The process is considerably different from interstate or intrastate extradition. [[Florida]], [[Alaska]], and [[Hawaii]] do not extradite for a misdemeanor conviction that was convicted in the US, as of 2010. Some felonies are an exception in American law such as a crime that is violent in nature, or a sexual offense, or felony [[driving while intoxicated]]; they will entail extradition from all states in the United States. Theft charges and small drug crimes are the exception; for instance, if a minor crime is committed in Florida, a person apprehended in [[Idaho]] will not be extradited back to the original crime's jurisdiction. Federal charges are governed by US federal law and most states, with the exceptions of [[South Carolina]] and [[Missouri]], have adopted the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act. In practice, Florida, Alaska, and Hawaii typically do not extradite if the crime in question is not a felony because of the associated costs of transporting the suspect and the housing fees that must be paid to the jurisdiction in which he is held until transported.

==Interstate extradition==
The [[Extradition Clause]] in the [[US Constitution]] requires states, upon demand of another state, to deliver a fugitive from justice who has committed a "[[treason]], [[felony]] or other [[crime]]" to the state from which the fugitive has fled. {{usc|18|3182}} sets the process by which an executive of a state, district, or territory of the United States must arrest and turn over a fugitive from another state, district, or territory.

For a person to be extradited interstate, {{usc|18|3182}} requires:

* An executive authority demand of the jurisdiction to which a person that is a fugitive from justice has fled.
* The requesting executive must also produce a copy of an [[indictment]] found or an [[affidavit]] made before a [[magistrate]] of any state or territory. The document must charge the fugitive demanded with having committed treason, felony, or other crime, and it must be certified as authentic by the governor or chief magistrate of the state or territory from where the person so charged has fled.
* The executive receiving the request must then cause the fugitive to be arrested and secure and to notify the requesting executive authority or agent to receive the fugitive.
* An agent of the executive of the state demanding extradition must appear to receive the prisoner, which must occur within 30 days from time of arrest, or the prisoner may be released. Some states allow longer waiting periods, of up to 90 days.
* Cases of [[kidnapping]] by a parent to another state see automatic involvement by the [[US Marshals Service]].

In ''[[Kentucky v. Dennison]]'',&lt;ref&gt;65 U.S. (24 How.) 66 (1860)&lt;/ref&gt; decided in 1860, the Supreme Court held that, although the governor of the asylum state had a constitutional duty to return a fugitive to the demanding state, the federal courts had no authority to enforce this duty. As a result, for more than 100 years, the governor of one state was deemed to have discretion on whether or not he/she would comply with another state's request for extradition.

In a 1987 case, ''[[Puerto Rico v. Branstad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;483 U.S. 219 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; the Court overruled ''Dennison'', and held that the governor of the asylum state has no discretion in performing his or her duty to extradite, whether that duty arises under the [[Extradition Clause]] of the Constitution or under the [[Extradition Act]] ({{usc|18|3182}}), and that a federal court may enforce the governor's duty to return the fugitive to the demanding state.&lt;ref&gt;See also, Alabama ex rel. its ''Governor &amp; Attorney General v. Engler'', 85 F.3d 1205 (6th Cir. 1996) (Governor of Michigan directed to return a fugitive to Alabama)&lt;/ref&gt; There are only four grounds upon which the Governor of the asylum state may deny another state’s request for extradition: (1) the extradition documents facially are not in order; (2) the person has not been charged with a crime in the demanding state; (3) the person is not the person named in the extradition documents; or (4) the person is not a fugitive.&lt;ref&gt;85 F.3d at 1208.&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be at least one additional exception: if the fugitive is under sentence in the asylum state, he need not be extradited until his punishment in the asylum state is completed.&lt;ref&gt;See People ex rel. Focarile ex rel. ''McNeil v. Goord'', 12 Misc. 3d 981, 819 N.Y.S.2d 815 (Sup. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extradition from the United States ===
Generally under United States law (18 U.S.C. § 3184), extradition may be granted only pursuant to a treaty.&lt;ref name="9-15.100" /&gt; Some countries grant extradition without a treaty, but every such country requires an offer of reciprocity when extradition is accorded in the absence of a treaty.&lt;ref name="9-15.100" /&gt; Further, the 1996 amendments to 18 U.S.C. 3181 and 3184 permit the United States to extradite, without regard to the existence of a treaty, persons (other than citizens, nationals or permanent residents of the United States) who have committed crimes of violence against nationals of the United States in foreign countries.&lt;ref name="9-15.100" /&gt;

All extradition treaties in force require foreign requests for extradition to be submitted through diplomatic channels, usually from the country's embassy in Washington to the Department of State.&lt;ref name="crm00612"&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00612.htm |chapter=Criminal Resource Manual: 612 Role of the Department of State in Foreign Extradition Requests |others=Title 9: [[United States Department of Justice Criminal Division|Criminal Division]] |title=[[United States Attorneys' Manual]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] |location=Washington, D.C. |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many treaties also require that requests for provisional arrest be submitted through diplomatic channels, although some permit provisional arrest requests to be sent directly to the Department of Justice.&lt;ref name="crm00612" /&gt; The Department of State reviews foreign extradition demands to identify any potential foreign policy problems and to ensure that there is a treaty in force between the United States and the country making the request, that the crime or crimes are extraditable offenses, and that the supporting documents are properly certified in accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 3190.&lt;ref name="crm00612" /&gt; If the request is in proper order, an attorney in the State Department's Office of the Legal Adviser prepares a certificate attesting to the existence of the treaty,  that the crime or crimes are extraditable offenses, and that the supporting documents are properly certified in accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 3190, and forwards it with the original request to the Justice Department's Office of International Affairs ("OIA").&lt;ref name="crm00612" /&gt;

Once the OIA receives a foreign extradition request, it reviews the request for sufficiency and forwards sufficient requests to the United States Attorney's Office for the judicial district in which the fugitive is located.&lt;ref name="9-15.700"&gt;{{cite web|title=9-15.700 International Extradition and Related Matters: Foreign Extradition Requests|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/15mcrm.htm#9-15.700|work=[[United States Attorneys' Manual]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] |accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Attorney's office then obtains a warrant, and the fugitive is arrested and brought before the magistrate judge or the US district judge.&lt;ref name="9-15.700" /&gt; The government opposes bond in extradition cases.&lt;ref name="9-15.700" /&gt; Unless the fugitive waives his or her right to a hearing, the court will hold a hearing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3184 to determine whether the fugitive is extraditable.&lt;ref name="9-15.700" /&gt;  If the court finds the fugitive to be extraditable, it enters an order of extraditability and certifies the record to the Secretary of State, who decides whether to surrender the fugitive to the requesting government.&lt;ref name="9-15.700" /&gt; OIA notifies the foreign government and arranges for the transfer of the fugitive to the agents appointed by the requesting country to receive him or her. Although the order following the extradition hearing is not appealable (by either the fugitive or the government), the fugitive may petition for a writ of habeas corpus as soon as the order is issued.&lt;ref name="9-15.700" /&gt;  The district court's decision on the writ is subject to appeal, and the extradition may be stayed if the court so orders.&lt;ref name="9-15.700" /&gt;

==== Habeas corpus in international extradition ====
Habeas corpus is a legal procedure initiated by an individual to test the legality of his detention by the government.&lt;ref&gt;28 U.S.C. § 2241 et. seq.&lt;/ref&gt;  To benefit from habeas corpus, the affected person, or someone on his behalf, must file a petition for relief before a court with jurisdiction.  The procedure is contained in 28 U.S.C. § 2241 et. seq.  When the habeas petition contests the decision of an extradition magistrate, the individual must argue that his detention and surrender to a foreign country violates the United States Constitution, the applicable extradition treaty, or a federal statute.&lt;ref&gt;See M. Cherif Bassiouni, International Extradition 933-44 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;         

Because orders of extradition cannot be appealed,&lt;ref&gt;''Collins v. Miller'', 252 U.S. 364, 369 (1920)("proceeding before a committing magistrate in international extradition is not subject to correction by appeal."); ''In re Mackin'', 668 F.2d 122, 127-28 (2nd Cir. 1981)(citing over a dozen cases supporting such proposition).&lt;/ref&gt; the only means for an individual to have them reviewed is to file a request for a writ of habeas corpus.  The government, on the other hand, may renew its request if the original one is denied.&lt;ref&gt;''Collins v. Loisel'', 262 U.S. 426, 429 (1923) (double jeopardy not applicable to extradition orders); ''Brown v. Allen'', 344 U.S. 443, 458 (1953) (res judicata not applicable to habeas proceedings).&lt;/ref&gt;  Habeas corpus review by a district court is generally available whenever an individual "is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States",&lt;ref&gt;28 U.S.C. § 2241(c)(3).&lt;/ref&gt; and is provided for several different types of detention in addition to extradition, such as detention after a criminal conviction, and for military purposes.  As part of its habeas review, the court will normally accept the factual findings of the extradition magistrate,&lt;ref&gt;''Ornelas v. Ruiz'', 161 U.S. 502, 509 (1896) (factual findings reviewed for clear error); ''Ordinola v. Hackman'', 478 F.3d 588, 599 (4th Cir. 2007)(factual findings by extradition magistrate deserve deference by habeas court).  But see Artemio Rivera, "The Consideration of Factual Issues in Extradition Habeas", 83 ''U. Cin. L. Rev.'' 809 (2015) for a discussion of the proper scope of habeas corpus in international extradition, and a criticism of the standard of review for factual issues.&lt;/ref&gt; while legal issues are considered anew.&lt;ref&gt;''Sacirbey v. Guccione'', 589 F.3d 52, 63 (2nd Cir. 2009); ''Noriega v. Pastrana'', 564 F.3d 1290, 1294 (11th Cir. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  

The scope of review of a writ of habeas corpus in extradition is meant to be limited.&lt;ref&gt;''Terliden v. Ames'', 184 U.S. 270, 278 (1902) ("The settled rule is that the writ of habeas corpus cannot perform the office of a writ of error...").&lt;/ref&gt; It is settled to cover at least inquiries on whether: (1) the extradition magistrate acquired jurisdiction over the individual and the matter; (2) the crime for which extradition is sought is included within the treaty as an extraditable offense, and (3) whether there is probable cause to commit the relator to trial.&lt;ref&gt;''Ornelas v. Ruiz'', 161 U.S. 502, 508-09 (1896); ''Fernandez v. Phillips'', 268 U.S. 311, 312 (1925).&lt;/ref&gt;  Many courts, however, have adopted an "expanded" scope of habeas review that additionally considers issues about the violation of constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;See ''In re Burt'', 737 F.2d 1477 (7th Cir. 1984); ''Plaster v. United States'', 720 F.2d 340 (4th Cir. 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;        

Petitioners in extradition cases may contest the legality of their detention though a habeas proceeding by arguing, for example, that the extradition treaty is not in force,&lt;ref&gt;''Noriega v. Pastrana'', 564 F.3d 1290, 1295 (11th Cir. 2009)("[t]he issue of whether the treaty of extradition has no force because another treaty or law prevents its operation" is a fundamental one reviewable through a writ of habeas corpus.)&lt;/ref&gt; that the alleged crime constitutes political behavior subject to exception,&lt;ref&gt;''Quinn v. Robinson'', 783 F.2d 776,786-87 (9th Cir. 1986); ''Eain v. Wilkes'', 641 F.2d 504, 520 (7th Cir. 1981). &lt;/ref&gt; that the determination of extraditability by the magistrate has not been made according to the requirements of the applicable United States statutes and treaty,&lt;ref&gt;See 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (c)(3) (habeas review available when the prisoner is "in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States."); ''Skaftouros v. United States'', 667 F.3d 144, 158 (2nd Cir. 2011) ("despite the narrow scope of habeas review in the extradition context, it is nevertheless our duty to ensure that the applicable provisions of the treaty and the governing American statutes are complied with.").&lt;/ref&gt; that the extradition procedure does not comply with the Constitution,&lt;ref&gt;''In re Burt'', 737 F.2d 1477, 1484 (7th Cir. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; and that the relator has not been formally charged.&lt;ref&gt;''Sacirbey v. Guccione'', 589 F.3d 52, 64 n. 16 (2nd Cir. 2009).   &lt;/ref&gt;   

Even though the decision of the extradition magistrate cannot be appealed, the habeas corpus determination by the district court is subject to appeal to the corresponding circuit court.  Thereafter, review may be sought through certiorari to the Supreme Court.

=== Extradition to the United States ===
The federal structure of the United States can pose particular problems with respect to extraditions when the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] and the power of foreign relations are held at different levels of the federal hierarchy. For instance, in the United States, most criminal prosecutions occur at the state level, and most foreign relations occur at the federal level. In fact, under the [[United States Constitution]], foreign countries may not have official treaty relations with sub-national units such as individual states; rather, they may have treaty relations only with the federal government. As a result, a state that wishes to prosecute an individual located in a foreign country must direct its extradition request through the federal government, which will negotiate the extradition with the foreign country. However, due to the constraints of federalism, any conditions on the extradition accepted by the federal government—such as not to impose the death penalty—are not binding on individual states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The U.S. Justice System: An Encyclopedia |editor-first=Steven Harmon |editor-last=Wilson |page=527 |year=2012 |location=Santa Barbara, Cal. |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=978-1-59884-304-0 |oclc=773670169 |lccn=2011041731 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOJvVJv2YlAC&amp;pg=PA527#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote=The political structure of countries, such as the federal structure of the United States, can bring about an additional difficulty in extradition proceedings, inasmuch as the governments of foreign nations have official relations only with the federal governments, not with the governments of a country's constituent states. It is not always clear whether an extradition agreement with the federal government is also binding to the states when a matter of state jurisdiction is involved.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ''[[Soering v. United Kingdom]]'', the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the [[United Kingdom]] was not permitted under its treaty obligations to extradite an individual to the United States, because the United States' federal government was constitutionally unable to offer binding assurances that the death penalty would not be sought in [[Virginia]] courts. Ultimately, the Commonwealth of Virginia itself had to offer assurances to the federal government, which passed those assurances on to the United Kingdom, which extradited the individual to the United States.

Additional problems can arise due to differing criteria for crimes. For instance, in the United States, crossing state lines is a prerequisite for certain federal crimes (otherwise crimes such as [[murder]] are handled by state governments except in certain circumstances such as the killing of a federal official).{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} This transportation clause is absent from the laws of many countries. Extradition treaties or subsequent diplomatic correspondence often include language providing that such criteria should not be taken into account when checking if the crime is one in the country from which extradition should apply.

To clarify the above point, if a person in the United States crosses the borders of the United States to go to another country, then that person has crossed a federal border, and federal law would apply in addition to state law. Crossing state lines (within the U.S.) in committing a crime could also create federal jurisdiction. In addition, travel by airplane in the United States subjects one to federal law, as all airports are subject to federal jurisdiction.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

It is unlawful for U.S. citizens to enter or exit the United States without a valid U.S. passport or [[Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative]]–compliant passport-replacement document, or without an exception or waiver.&lt;ref name="revocations"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Passport Revocations or Denials on the Ground of National Security and Foreign Policy |first=Evelyn |last=Capassakis |journal=[[Fordham Law Review|Fordham L.

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:MMU logo.png|thumb|200px|[[Manchester Metropolitan University]] is the qualification awarding institution]] --&gt;

The '''Graduate Diploma in English and Hong Kong Law''' ('''GDEHKL''') is a [[Hong Kong]] [[graduate diploma]] programme that allows students that did not take [[law]] as an [[undergraduate degree]] (i.e. "non-law students") to "convert" to law, before going onto a [[professional qualification]] course and ultimately legal training. 

The GDEHKL is a localised mutation of the [[Common Professional Examination]] of [[England and Wales]] (CPE), or Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL).  It is jointly offered by the [[University of Hong Kong]]'s School of Professional and Continuing Education ([[HKU SPACE]]) as the course operator, and [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] as the qualification awarding institution. The completion of the course qualifies students to proceed to legal training courses in Hong Kong and England &amp; Wales or to many LL.M. programmes.&lt;ref&gt;http://hkuspace.hku.hk/prog/cpe&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates of the GDEHKL include Judge Anthea Pang Po-kam of the Court of First Instance of the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201311/14/P201311140251.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The GDEHKL is the only law programme in Hong Kong  which substantially satisfies both the requirements for entry into the [[Postgraduate Certificate in Laws]] (PCLL) for those who intend to practice law in [[Hong Kong]], and also the requirements for entry into the [[Legal Practice Course]] (LPC) and the English [[Bar Professional Training Course]] (BPTC) for those who intend to practice in [[England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;http://hkuspace.hku.hk/prog/cpe&lt;/ref&gt; The GDEHKL is recognised by the Standing Committee on Legal Education and Training as demonstrating competence in the three Top-up Subjects on Hong Kong law required for entry to the PCLL.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcea.com.hk/newrequirement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates of the GDEHKL who continue on to take the additional MMU LLB year after the CPE will have passed all necessary law subjects required for PCLL eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://hkuspace.hku.hk/prog/llb-mmu&lt;/ref&gt;

The GDEHKL is an exempted course under a Hong Kong law known as the Non-Local Higher and Professional Education (Regulation) Ordinance,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/edu-system/postsecondary/non-local-higher-professional-edu/course/exempted-course.html&lt;/ref&gt; which states that it is a matter of discretion for individual employers to recognize any qualification to which this course may lead.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/edu-system/postsecondary/non-local-higher-professional-edu/info-for-student/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2985">The '''Harrison Tweed Award''' was created in 1956 to recognize the extraordinary achievements of state and local bar associations that develop or significantly expand projects or programs to increase access to civil legal services for poor persons or criminal defense services for indigents. This award is given annually by the [[American Bar Association]]'s (ABA) Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants and the [[National Legal Aid &amp; Defender Association]], is presented during the ABA Annual Meeting at a joint luncheon of the National Conference of Bar Presidents, National Association of Bar Executives and National Conference of Bar Foundations. The award is named for [[Harrison Tweed]], past president of [[Sarah Lawrence College]].

1953 • [[Governor of New York|New York State Governor]] [[Thomas E. Dewey]], and the state legislature formed the temporary Tweed Commission (named after its chair, lawyer Harrison Tweed) to conduct public and private hearings regarding the post-[[World War II]] court situation; such as overall caseload volumes that had grown to the point where court delay was becoming a major problem and procedural reform was necessary.

1955 • The Legislature created the Judicial Conference to allow for periodic meetings of judges to discuss problems and established the Office of State Administrator; their functions were merely advisory but allowed the permanent examination of court operations.

1958 • The Tweed Commission Report proposed reform through centralization of court administration, simplification of court structure, and continued supervision of the courts by the Judicial Conference and the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division]].

1962 • A new Judiciary Article for the [[Constitution of New York|State Constitution]], implementing many of the Tweed Commission recommendations, was approved by the Legislature and the voters; this article created the "Unified Court System," established the various trial courts, established the Administrative Board of the Judicial Conference (the Chief Judge of the Court of the Appellate Division), and conferred on the Appellate Divisions various administrative powers.

'''NOTE''': Tweed fellow family members included [[Simeon Eben Baldwin]], [[Governor of Connecticut|Connecticut Governor]] and cofounder, American Bar Association; and [[Roger Nash Baldwin]], cofounder and the first executive director, American Civil Liberties Union ([[ACLU]]).

[[File:Vilnius Ban.jpg|thumb|''Herem'' placed on the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] by the [[Vilna Gaon]] in 1781.]]
'''''Herem''''' ({{Lang-he-n|חֵרֶם}}, also Romanized ''chērem, ḥērem'') is the highest ecclesiastical censure in the [[Jews|Jewish community]]. It is the total exclusion of a person from the Jewish community. It is a form of [[shunning]] and is similar to ''vitandus'' "[[excommunication]]" in the [[Catholic Church]]. Cognate terms in other Semitic languages include the [[Arabic]] terms ''[[haram|ḥarām]]'' "forbidden, taboo, off-limits, or immoral" and haram "set apart, sanctuary", and the [[Ge'ez]] word ''ʿirm'' "accursed".

Arguably the most famous case of a herem is that of [[Baruch Spinoza]], the seventeenth century philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Judaism |first1=Sara E. |last1=Karesh |first2=Mitchell M. |last2=Hurvitz |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2cCZBDm8F8C&amp;pg=PA205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Essential Agus: The Writings of Jacob B. Agus |first=Jacob Bernard |last=Agus |page=252 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bM4yCnxubukC&amp;pg=PA252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other famous subjects of a herem were early Russian communists [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]]. Sometime in 1918, while Ukraine was under German occupation, the [[rabbi]]s of [[Odessa]] pronounced herem against Trotsky, Zinoviev, and other Jewish [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] leaders in the synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;Zinoviev cynically referred to this in his eulogy of Uritsky (the chief of the Petrograd Cheka, assassinated on August 30, 1918):{{quote|When we read that in Odessa, under [[Skoropadsky family|Skoropadsky]], the rabbis assembled in special council, and there these representatives of the rich Jews, officially, before the entire world, excommunicated from the Jewish community such Jews as Trotsky and me, your obedient servant, and others - no single hair of any of us has turned gray because of grief"|Zinoviev, Sochineniia, 16:224, quoted in Bezbozhnik [The godless], no. 20 (12 September 1938).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==

Although developed from the [[Bible|Biblical]] ban, excommunication, as employed by the rabbis during [[Talmud|Talmudic times]] and during the Middle Ages, became a rabbinic institution, the object of which was to preserve Jewish solidarity. A system of laws was gradually developed by rabbis, by means of which this power was limited, so that it became one of the modes of legal punishment by rabbinic courts. While it did not entirely lose its arbitrary character, since individuals were allowed to pronounce the ban of excommunication on particular occasions, it became chiefly a legal measure resorted to by a judicial court for certain prescribed offenses.

== Etymology and cognate terms ==

The three terms ''herem'' "censure, excommunication", [[herem (war or property)|the devotion of enemies by annihilation]]" in the [[Tanakh]], and [[herem (priestly gift)|the devotion of property]] to a [[kohen]], are all three variant English [[transliteration]]s of the same Hebrew noun. This noun comes from the [[semitic root]] [[Ḥ-R-M]].

There is also a [[homonym]] ''herem'' "fisherman's net", which appears nine times in the [[Masoretic Text]] of the Tanakh, that has no etymological connection to ''herem''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brown Driver Briggs]] ''Hebrew Lexicon,'' entries ''herem'' 1, ''herem'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Talmudic usage of ''herem'' for excommunication can be distinguished from the usage of ''herem'' described in the Tanakh in the time of [[Joshua]] and the early Hebrew monarchy, which was the practice of consecration by total annihilation&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124494788&amp;ps=cprs&lt;/ref&gt; at the command of God carried out against peoples such as the [[Midian]]ites, the [[Amalek#Amalekites in the Hebrew Bible|Amalekites]], and the entire population of [[Jericho]]. The neglect of [[Saul]] to carry out such a command as delivered by [[Samuel]] resulted in the selection of [[David]] as his replacement.

== Offenses ==
The Talmud speaks of twenty-four offenses that, in theory, were punishable by a form of ''[[Niddah#Etymology and usage|niddui]]'' or temporary excommunication. [[Maimonides]] (as well as later authorities) enumerates the twenty-four as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910980/jewish/Talmud-Torah-Chapter-Six.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
# insulting a learned man, even after his death;
# insulting a messenger of the court;
# calling a fellow Jew a "slave";
# refusing to appear before the court at the appointed time;
# dealing lightly with any of the [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic]] or Mosaic precepts;
# refusing to abide by a decision of the court;
# keeping in one's possession an animal or an object that may prove injurious to others, such as a savage dog or a broken ladder;
# selling one's real estate to a non-Jew without assuming the responsibility for any injury that the non-Jew may cause his neighbors;
# testifying against one's Jewish neighbor in a non-Jewish court, and thereby causing that neighbor to lose money which he would not have lost had the case been decided in a Jewish court;
# a kohen [[shechita|shochet]] (butcher)&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliezer ben Joel HaLevi|Raaviah]] to Chullin chap. 1225, [[Meir of Rothenburg]] responsa 7 (mossad horav kook vol. 2 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; who refuses to give the [[foreleg, cheeks and maw ]] of [[kashrut|kosher-slaughtered]] livestock to another Kohen;
# violating the second day of a holiday, even though its observance is only a custom;
# performing work on the afternoon of the day preceding Passover;
# taking the name of God in vain;
# causing others to profane the name of God;
# causing others to eat holy meat outside of Jerusalem;
# making calculations for the calendar, and establishing festivals accordingly, outside of Israel;
# putting a stumbling-block in the way of the blind, that is to say, tempting another to sin ([[Lifnei iver]]);
# preventing the community from performing some religious act;
# selling forbidden ("[[terefah]]") meat as permitted meat ("kosher");
# failure by a shochet to show his knife to the rabbi for examination;
# purposely bringing oneself to erection;
# engaging in business with one's divorced wife that will lead them to come into contact with each other;
# being made the subject of scandal (in the case of a rabbi);
# declaring an unjustified excommunication.

== The niddui ==

The ''[[niddui]]'' ({{Lang-he|נידוי}}) ban was usually imposed for a period of seven days (in Israel thirty days). If inflicted on account of money matters, the offender was first publicly warned ("hatra'ah") three times, on Monday, Thursday, and Monday successively, at the regular service in the synagogue. During the period of niddui, no one except the members of his immediate household was permitted to associate with the offender, or to sit within four cubits of him, or to eat in his company. He was expected to go into mourning and to refrain from bathing, cutting his hair, and wearing shoes, and he had to observe all the laws that pertained to a mourner. He could not be counted in the [[minyan|quorum for the performance of a public religious function]]. If he died, a stone was placed on his hearse, and the relatives were not obliged to observe the ceremonies customary at the death of a kinsman, such as the tearing of garments, [[Bereavement in Judaism|etc.]].

It was in the power of the court to lessen or increase the severity of the niddui. The court might even reduce or increase the number of days, forbid all intercourse with the offender, and exclude his children from the schools and his wife from the synagogue, until he became humbled and willing to repent and obey the court's mandates. According to one opinion, the apprehension that the offender might leave the Jewish fold on account of the severity of the excommunication did not prevent the court from adding [[rigor]] to its punishments so as to maintain its dignity and authority ([[Shulkhan Arukh]], [[Yoreh De'ah]], 334, 1, [[Moses Isserles|Rama's]] [[Gloss (transliteration)|gloss]], citing ''[[Alexander Susslein|Sefer Agudah]]''). This opinion is vehemently contested by the [[David HaLevi Segal|Taz]] (ibid.), who cites earlier authorities of the same opinion ([[Solomon Luria|Maharshal]]; [[Meir of Rothenburg|Maharam]]; [[Judah ben Eliezer ha-Levi Minz|Mahari Mintz]]) and presents proof of his position from the Talmud. Additionally, the Taz notes that his edition of the ''Sefer Agudah'' does not contain the cited position.

== The herem ==

If the offense was in reference to monetary matters, or if the punishment was inflicted by an individual, the laws were more lenient, the chief punishment being that men might not associate with the offender. At the expiration of the period the ban was raised by the court. If, however, the excommunicate showed no sign of penitence or remorse, the niddui might be renewed once and again, and finally the "herem," the most rigorous form of excommunication, might be pronounced. This extended for an indefinite period, and no one was permitted to teach the offender or work for him, or benefit him in any way, except when he was in need of the bare necessities of life.

== The nezifah ==

A milder form than either niddui or herem was the "nezifah" ban. (In modern Hebrew, "nezifah" generally means "a dressing-down" or "reading (someone) the riot act", i.e., a stern verbal rebuke.) This ban generally only lasted one day. During this time the offender dared not appear before him whom he had displeased. He had to retire to his house, speak little, refrain from business and pleasure, and manifest his regret and remorse. He was not required, however, to separate himself from society, nor was he obliged to apologize to the man whom he had insulted; for his conduct on the day of nezifah was sufficient apology. But when a scholar or prominent man actually pronounced the formal niddui on one who had slighted him, all the laws of niddui applied. This procedure was, however, much discouraged by the sages, so that it was a matter of proper pride for a rabbi to be able to say that he had never pronounced the ban of excommunication. Maimonides concludes with these words the chapter on the laws of excommunication:(''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', Talmud Torah, vii. 13).

: "Although the power is given to the scholar to excommunicate a man who has slighted him, it is not praiseworthy for him to employ this means too frequently. He should rather shut his ears to the words of the ignorant and pay no attention to them, as Solomon, in his wisdom, said, 'Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken' (Eccl. vii. 21). This was the custom of the early pious men, who would not answer when they heard themselves insulted, but would forgive the insolent. . . . But this humility should be practised only when the insult occurs in private; when the scholar is publicly insulted, he dares not forgive; and if he forgive he should be punished, for then it is an insult to the Torah that he must revenge until the offender humbly apologizes"

== Since the Jewish Enlightenment ==

Except in rare cases in the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] and Hasidic communities, ''herem'' stopped existing after the [[Haskalah]], when local Jewish communities lost their political autonomy, and Jews were integrated into the gentile nations in which they lived.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In 1918, the Rabbinical Council of [[Odessa]], declared ''herem'' on [[Leon Trotsky]] and several other Jewish [[Bolsheviks]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

In 1945, rabbi [[Mordecai Kaplan]], the founder of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] (a Jewish religious movement that seeks to divorce Judaism from belief in a personal deity), was formally excommunicated by the Haredi [[Union of Orthodox Rabbis]] (''Agudath HaRabonim'').{{cn|date=September 2018}}

In 2004, the [[High Court of South Africa]] upheld a herem against a [[Johannesburg]] businessman because he refused to pay his former wife [[alimony]] as ordered by a [[beth din]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.roylaw.co.za/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.article&amp;pageID=6218762&amp;ArticleID=7315629 |title=Judge upholds Jewish excommunication right |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060115010952/http://www.roylaw.co.za/Index.cfm?fuseaction=home.article&amp;pageID=6218762&amp;ArticleID=7315629 |archive-date=15 January 2006 |author=Estelle Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5765/noach/asa.htm South African Court |title=Upholds Beis Din Cheirem |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226113051/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5765/noach/asa.htm |archive-date=26 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A herem against members of [[Neturei Karta]] who attended the [[International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust]] was declared by numerous Haredi religious leaders, including the leaders of the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] and [[Chabad]] Hassidic groups.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

'''''Hughes v. Fetter''''', 341 U.S. 609 (1951), is a [[Supreme Court case]] involving the [[Conflict of laws in the United States|conflict of laws]] between states.

==Facts==
Harold Hughes, a resident of [[Wisconsin]], was killed in an [[automobile accident]] while driving in [[Illinois]]. The other driver, Fetter, was also a Wisconsin resident, and Fetter's insurance company was also located in Wisconsin. The administrator of Hughes' estate filed a [[wrongful death claim]] in Wisconsin state court, alleging that the death was caused by [[negligence]] on Fetter's part.&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;William L. Reynolds, William M. Richman, ''The Full Faith and Credit Clause: A Reference Guide to the United States '' (2005), p. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the administrator's action was filed in Wisconsin, and the defendants were a Wisconsin resident and a Wisconsin-based insurance company, the suit was based on the Illinois wrongful death statute. The trial court granted [[summary judgment]] on the merits to the defendants, holding that the [[public policy]] of Wisconsin, which had a "door-closing" statute with respect to wrongful death actions, which expressly limited the courts to compensating deaths occurring in Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="Reynolds"/&gt; This was affirmed by the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]], and the administrator then filed a petition for certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, asserting that the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] required the Wisconsin courts to apply Illinois law.

==Decision==
The U.S. Supreme Court reversed, holding that because Wisconsin's statutory policy would exclude the Illinois cause of action, the public policy asserted violated the national policy of giving Full Faith and Credit to the laws of other states. The Court found that the Illinois wrongful death statute is a "public act", and that Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each state to the "public acts" of every other state. The Court noted that Wisconsin enforced wrongful death suits under its own law, and therefore evinced no strong public policy against such claims that would justify excluding them from its courts.&lt;ref name="Reynolds"/&gt;

A [[dissenting opinion]] by Justice Frankfurter, joined by three other justices, argued that states should be able to close their courts to foreign causes of action where there is a reasonable basis to do so. Frankurter believed there was such a basis here, because the suit could have been brought in Illinois, and because there were substantial differences in the wrongful death laws of the two states.

The Court was unclear about what the objectionable discrimination really was, between the imposition of the law of another state, or the fact that the case involved an accident in another state. It has been noted that the Court also "allowed for an indeterminate exception to the ''Hughes'' rule" in circumstances "when the forum did have an antipathy to the foreign claim".&lt;ref name="Reynolds"/&gt;

==Impact==
''Hughes'' is considered the leading case on the constitutionality of door-closing statutes.&lt;ref name="Reynolds"/&gt;

The '''Irish Music Rights Organisation''' (IMRO) is a national organisation that administers the performing right in copyright music in Ireland on behalf of its members (who are songwriters, composers and music publishers) and on behalf of the songwriters, composers and music publishers of the international overseas societies that are affiliated to it.

A public performance of copyright music takes place when that music is used anywhere outside of the domestic environment.

IMRO´s function is to collect and distribute royalties arising from the public performance of copyright works. IMRO is a not-for-profit organisation.

Music users such as broadcasters, venues and businesses must pay for their use of copyright music by way of a blanket licence fee. IMRO collects these monies and distributes them to the songwriters, composers and music publishers who created the songs. The monies earned by copyright owners in this way are known as public performance royalties.

      <comment>Amend 'preference' (which may be arbitrary) for 'discretion' (which in English is the term usually used for an exercise in principled legal judgment).</comment>

'''''{{transl|ar|DIN|Istiḥsan}}''''' ([[Arabic]]: {{wikt-lang|ar|اِسْتِحْسَان}}) is an Arabic term for juristic discretion. In its literal sense it means "to consider something good". [[Muslim]] scholars may use it to express their preference for particular judgements in  [[Sharia|Islamic law]] over other possibilities. It is one of the principles of legal thought underlying scholarly interpretation or [[ijtihad]].

A number of disputes existed amongst the classical jurists over this principle with the Hanafite jurists adopting this as a secondary source. Contemporary proponents of [[liberal movements within Islam]] have used ''istihsan'' and the similar idea of ''[[istislah]]'' (Arabic for "to deem proper") as ethical principles to favour feminist and reformist interpretations of the [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah]], thus looking to reform [[Sharia|Islamic law]].

==Etymology==
''{{transl|ar|DIN|Istiḥsan}}'' ({{lang|ar|استحسان}} {{IPA-ar|istiħsaːn|}}) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word derived from the word ''al-husn'' ({{lang|ar|الحسن}}) which means good which is the opposite meaning of ''al-qubh'' ({{lang|ar|القبح}}) which means bad. The word ''{{transl|ar|DIN|istiḥsan}}'' is used to express "decorating or improving or considering something good".&lt;ref&gt;Mohd Hafiz Jamaludin and Ahmad Hidayat Buang "[http://www.dakwah.unisnu.ac.id/asset/webadmin/js/kcfinder/upload/files/Vol%201,%20No%201%20(2013)%20International%20Journal%20Of%20Nusantara%20Islam.pdf Syariah Courts in Malaysia and the Development of Islamic Jurisprudence: The Study of Istihsan]" International Journal of Nusantara Islam 1, no. 1 (2014): 2.{{ISSN|2252-5904}}. {{DOI| 10.15575/ijni.v1i1.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also applies to mean something towards which one is inclined or which one prefers, even if it is not approved by others.&lt;ref&gt;Nyazee, Islamic Jurisprudence, 2000, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;
Technically it has been defined in several ways by Muslim jurists:
* Bazdawi defines it as moving away from the implications of an analogy to an analogy that is stronger than it.&lt;ref name="Bazdawi"&gt;al-Bazdawi, Usul al-Bazdawi&lt;/ref&gt;
* Al-Halwani defines it as giving up an analogy for a stronger evidence from the [[Quran]], [[Sunnah]] or [[ijma]].&lt;ref name="Bazdawi"/&gt;
* The Maliki jurist, Ibn al-Arabi defines it as sacrificing some of the implications of an evidence by way of exception.&lt;ref name="Bazdawi"/&gt;
* Al-Karkhi defines Istihsan as follows: Istihsan is when one takes a decision on a certain case different from that on which similar cases have been decided on the basis of its precedents, for a reason which is stronger than one found in similar cases and which requires departure from those cases.&lt;ref&gt;Saim Kayadibi, ''Doctrine of Istihsan (Juristic Preference) in Islamic Law'', (Konya: Tablet Kitabevi, 2007), 104. {{ISBN|978-975-6346-79-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Istihsan==
A number of categorisations have been employed by the jurists:
* Istihsan through the text ([[Nass (Islam)|nass]])
* Istihsan on the basis of consensus ([[ijma]])
* Istihsan on the basis of what is good ([[maruf (Islam)|maruf]])
* Istihsan on the basis of necessity ([[darurah]])
* Istihsan on the basis of benefit ([[Maslahah]])
* Istihsan on the basis of analogy ([[qiyas khafi]])

==Examples of Istihsan==
The following comprise classical examples for this principle:
* Abu Hanifah stated that the one who eats out of forgetfulness whilst fasting should repeat the fast - however he moves away from this by the evidence of a narration that allows the fast to stand.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Abd al-Aziz al-Bukhari, Kash al-Asrar, Vol 4,7&lt;/ref&gt;
* Analogy requires that the manufacturing contract with advance payment be prohibited on the basis of analogy - however this is made permissible according to [[ijma]].
* Analogy requires that pure water be used for ablution so wells in which dirt or carcasses of animals have fallen would be prohibited for use according to strict analogy. Necessity exceptionalises this and permits the use of this water provided formal cleaning methods are applied first.

==Criticisms==
[[Al-Shafi'i]] viewed the practice of juristic preference as a heretical usurping [[God in Islam|God]]'s sole right as the legislator of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Shafi'i]], [[Kitab al-Umm]], vol. 7, pg. 309-320. [[Cairo]] Dar al-fikr, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged that this criticism revolves more around the linguistic meaning of the term rather than its technical meaning,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; though modern scholarship regards Shafi'is comments as a direct criticism of the technical meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard G. Weiss]], ''The Search for God's Law: Islamic Jurisprudence in the Writings of Sayf al-Din al-Amidi'', pg. 672. [[Salt Lake City]]: [[University of Utah Press]], 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malik ibn Anas]] is noted to have been asked about binding divorce. When he delivered his response, a disciple of his quickly reached for a tablet to make note of this ruling. Upon realizing what his disciple was doing, Malik asked him to stop, remarking that his opinion could change before nightfall.&lt;ref&gt;Virani, Shafique N. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarakhsi points out that some jurists have criticised Istihsan on the grounds that the analogy is being given up for personal opinion, something prohibited in Islam. He refutes this understanding as incomprehensible, as no jurist would give up an authority for something that lacked evidence.&lt;ref&gt;al-Sarakhsi, Kitab al-Usul&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jakarta Charter''' was a  document drawn up by members of the Indonesian [[Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence]] in June 1945 that subsequently formed the basis of the preamble to the [[Constitution of Indonesia]]. It included an obligation for Muslims to abide by [[Shariah law]].

==Background==
In March 1945, the Japanese military authority in Java during the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]] established the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (''Badan Penyelidik Usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan'' (BPUPK)) to decide on key issues related to the future independent state, including its constitution. There was a clear division on the committee between those who wanted a secular state and those who wanted a greater role for Islam.  On 1 June, the last day of the first session, nationalist and future Indonesian president [[Sukarno]] made a speech outlining the [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] - the five principles that would form the ideological basis of the new state. A sub-committee of eight members, the ''panitia kecil'' (small committee), was set up with Sukarno as chairman to discuss the issues that had emerged.{{sfn|Elson|2009|p=112}}

==The drawing up of the document==
In the recess between the two BPUPK sessions, at the urging of future president [[Sukarno]], 38 members met and decided to task a committee of nine members, the ''Panitia Sembilan'', with starting to draft the constitution.{{sfn|Elson|2010|p=26}}  These members, and their affiliations were:{{sfn|Tim Penyusun|2009|p=112}}{{sfn|Anshari|1976|p=38}}

* Sukarno (secular Muslim nationalist)
* [[Mohammad Hatta]] (secular Muslim nationalist)
* [[Alexander Andries Maramis|A.A. Maramis]] (secular Christian nationalist)
* [[Abikoesno Tjokrosoejoso]] (Muslim nationalist, former leader of the [[Indonesian Islamic Union Party]] (PSII))
* [[Abdoel Kahar Moezakir]] (Muslim nationalist, leading member of [[Muhammadiyah]])
* [[Agus Salim]] (Muslim nationalist, former leader of [[Sarekat Islam]])
* [[Achmad Soebardjo]] (secular Muslim nationalist)
* [[Wahid Hasjim]] (Muslim nationalist, leader of [[Nahdlatul Ulama]])
* [[Mohammad Yamin]] (secular Muslim nationalist)

Over the course of the afternoon of 22 June, the nine men produced a preamble for the constitution that included Sukarno's Pancasila philosophy, but added the seven words in Indonesian (''dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariat Islam bagi pemeluknya''){{sfn|Nasution|1995|p=460}}  that placed an obligation on Muslims to abide by Islamic law.{{sfn|Elson|2009|p=112}} Mohammad Yamin, who played a dominant role in the wording, named the preamble the Jakarta Charter.{{sfn|Elson|2009|p=113}}

==Text of the document==

{{quotation|Whereas independence is a genuine right of all nations and any form of foreign occupation should thus be erased from the earth as it is not in conformity with humanity and justice,

Whereas the struggle of the Indonesian independence movement has reached the blissful point of leading the Indonesian people safely and well before the monumental gate of an independent Indonesian State which shall be free, united, sovereign, just and prosperous,

By the grace of Almighty Allah and urged by the lofty aspiration to exist as a free nation,

Now therefore, the people of Indonesia declare herewith their independence,

Pursuant to which, in order to form a Government of the State of Indonesia that shall protect the whole people of Indonesia and the entire homeland of Indonesia, and in order to advance general prosperity, to develop the nation's intellectual life, and to contribute to the implementation of a world order based on freedom, lasting peace and social justice, Indonesia's National Independence shall be laid down in a Constitution of the State of Indonesia, which is to be established as the State of the Republic of Indonesia with sovereignty of the people and based on the belief in the One and Only God, with the obligation to abide by Islamic law for adherents of Islam, on just and civilized humanity, on the unity of Indonesia and on democratic rule that is guided by the strength of wisdom resulting from deliberation / representation, so as to realize social justice for all the people of Indonesia.

==Subsequent developments==
On 17 August 1945, Sukarno [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|declared Indonesian independence]]. The following day, the [[Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence]] (PPKI), which had been established with Japanese permission on 7 August, was due to meet. Hatta in particular and Sukarno were both worried that the obligation on Muslims would alienate non-Muslims. Before the meeting, Hatta met with Muslim leaders and managed to persuade them to agree to the removal of the seven words "for the sake of national unity".{{sfn|Elson|2009|p=120}} The PPKI then met and elected Sukarno and Hatta president and vice-president respectively.{{sfn|Kahin|1952|p=127}} It then discussed the draft constitution, including the preamble. Hatta spoke in favour of removing the seven words, and Balinese delegate, I Gusti Ktut Puja, suggested replacing the Arabic word "Allah" with the Indonesian word for God ("Tuhan"). This was accepted, but for some reason when the constitution was officially published, this change was not made.{{sfn|Elson|2009|p=121}} Following further discussion, the constitution was approved.{{sfn|Butt &amp; Lindsey |2012|p=168}}

When the 1945 constitution was replaced by the [[United States of Indonesia]] [[Federal Constitution of 1949]], and this in turn replaced by the [[Provisional Constitution of 1950]], there were no attempts to include the seven words in the preambles, despite their similarity to 1945 version.{{sfn|Elson|2009|p=130}} However, in 1959, the [[Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia]], which had been set up to produce a permanent constitution, reached deadlock as the [[Islamist]] fraction wanted a greater role for Islam, but like the other factions, did not have enough support to win the two-thirds majority to push through its proposals. The Islamist faction supported the government's proposal to return to the 1945 Constitution on condition that the obligation on Muslims be re-inserted in the preamble. The nationalist faction voted this down, and in response, the Islamist faction vetoed the reintroduction of the 1945 Constitution. On 9 July 1959, Sukarno issued a [[President Sukarno's 1959 Decree|decree]] dissolving the assembly and  reinstating the original constitution, but without the seven words the Islamists wanted. To placate them, Sukarno stated that his decree relied on the Jakarta Charter, which had inspired the 1945 Constitution and which was an "inseparable" part of it, but was not a legal part of it.{{sfn|Indrayana |2008|p=16-17}}{{sfn|Ricklefs|2008|p=417}}

There were two further attempts to revive the Jakarta Charter. In the 1968 special session of the [[People's Consultative Assembly|Provisional People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPR), Parmusi, a new Islamist party, called for it to have legal force, but the proposal was voted down.{{sfn|Ricklefs|2008|p=461}} In 2002, during the MPR session that passed the final amendments to the constitutions, a number of small Islamic parties with the support of Vice-president [[Hamzah Haz]] tried again, this time by amending the Article 29 of the constitution to make shariah law obligatory on Muslims, but they were resoundingly defeated.{{sfn|Butt &amp; Lindsey |2012|p=168}}{{sfn|Ricklefs|2008|p=551}}

{{homicide}}
 
A '''lust murder''' is a [[homicide]] in which the offender searches for erotic satisfaction by killing someone. ''Lust murder'' is synonymous with the [[paraphilic]] term '''erotophonophilia''', which is [[sexual arousal]] or gratification contingent on the death of a human being. The phrase "lust killing" stems from the original work of [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] in his 1898 discussion of [[sexual sadism|sadistic]] homicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Homicide: A Psychiatric Perspective|last = Malmquist|first = Carl P.|publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc.|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, this type of crime is manifested either by murder during [[sexual activity]], by [[Mutilation|mutilating]] the [[sexual organ]]s or areas of the victim's body, or by murder and mutilation. The mutilation of the victim may include [[Disembowelment|evisceration]], displacement of the sexual organs, or both.&lt;ref name="aggrawal"&gt;{{cite book | first=Anil | last=Aggrawal | coauthors= | title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices | publisher=[[CRC Press]] | location=Boca Raton | year=2009 | isbn=1-4200-4308-0 |url=http://crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781420043082}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mutilation usually takes place postmortem.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010" /&gt; Although the killing sequence may include an act of sexual intercourse, sexual intercourse does not always occur, and other types of sexual acts may be part of the homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Homicide: A Psychiatric Perspective|last = Malmquist|first = Carl P.|publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc.|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Characteristics==
Lust murder sometimes includes activities such as removing clothing from the body, posing and propping of the body in different positions (generally sexual ones), insertion of objects into bodily orifices, [[Cannibalism|anthropophagy]] (the consumption of human blood and/or flesh) and [[necrophilia]] (the performing of sex acts on a human corpse).

Most cases of lust murder involve male perpetrators, although accounts of female lust murderers do exist.&lt;ref name="Female_Lust_Kill"&gt;{{cite news|title=When Women Kill Together. |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1613/is_1_16/ai_n29335603/ |work=The Forensic Examiner |publisher=American College of Forensic Examiners Institute (ACFEI) |date=2007-03-22 |accessdate=2009-08-08 |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829110653/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1613/is_1_16/ai_n29335603/ |archivedate=2010-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, lust murder is a phenomenon most common among [[serial killers]]. These offenders have made a connection between murder and sexual gratification. When this type of offender chooses a victim there must be something about that victim that the offender finds sexually attractive. This attractive trait might be common among all of the offender's victims and is called the offender's Ideal Victim Type (IVT). There might be many potential targets that an offender passes by because they do not meet their IVT. Once the offender has found a victim who is ideal, they might engage in stalking or other predatory behaviors before acting out their fantasy on their victim. Fantasies are a key component in lust murders and can never be completely fulfilled. The lust killer will have a fantasy that continues to evolve over time and becomes increasingly violent as they struggle to fulfill it.&lt;ref name="Holmes &amp; Holmes"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Ronald | last1=Holmes | first2= Stephen | last2=Holmes | title=Serial Murder (3rd edition) | publisher=[[Sage Publications]] | location=Thousand Oaks, CA | year=2010 | pages=107–121 |isbn=978-1-4129-7442-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most critical component in the psychological development of a serial killer is violent fantasy, especially in the lust murderer.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010"&gt;Hickey, Eric W. (2010). Serial Murderers and Their Victims (5th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasies accompany "intrusive thoughts about killing someone that are associated with other distressing [[psychopathological]] processes".&lt;ref&gt;Crabb, Peter B. (2000). The Material Culture of Homicidal Fantasies. Aggressive Behavior, 26, 225-234&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasies can never be completely fulfilled; sometimes the experience of killing can generate new fantasies of violence, creating a repetitive cycle. The purpose of fantasy is total control of the victim, whereas a [[sexual assault]] can be used as a vehicle for control. Sexual [[torture]] becomes a tool to degrade, humiliate, and subjugate the victim.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010"/&gt; Often victims are selected by the killer to stand as a proxy, resulting from childhood trauma. Fantasies may be fueled by pornography and facilitated by alcohol or other causes.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2010"/&gt; Typically, fantasies involve one or several forms of [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref name="Holmes &amp; Holmes"/&gt;

The term ''lust murder'' is also used in a related, but slightly different sense, to refer to an individual who gains ''[[sexual arousal]]'' from the act of committing murder, or has persistent ''[[sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]]'' of committing murder, even if the murder itself does not involve the genital mutilation or other aforementioned characteristics. As such, it is a type of [[paraphilia]].

Although the dynamic of violent fantasy in lust murders is understood, an individual's violence fantasy alone is not enough to determine if an individual has or has not engaged in lust murder. Moreover, to conclude that an individual is the murderer because they have drawn multitudes of violent images is overreaching.&lt;ref&gt;Perri, Frank S. and Lichtenwald, Terrance G. (2009). “[http://www.all-about-forensic-psychology.com/support-files/criminal-profiling.pdf When Worlds Collide: Criminal Investigative Analysis, Forensic Psychology And the Timothy Masters Case].” Forensic Examiner, 18:2 NCJ # 226972&lt;/ref&gt; The Perri and Lichtenwald article illustrates the critical importance of homicide detectives employing the Criminal Investigative Analysis model developed by Roy Hazelwood FBI (ret.), profiler and one of the top researchers in the field of lust murders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4570">A '''ministerial decree''' or '''ministerial order''' is a [[decree]] by a [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]]. With a ministerial decree the administrative department is delegated the task to impose a formal judgement or mandate. Ministerial decrees are usually imposed under the authority of the department's chief minister, secretary or administrator.

== Belgium ==
In [[Belgium]], a ministerial decree ({{lang-nl|ministerieel besluit}}, {{lang-fr|arrêté ministériel}}) is a decision of a minister of the [[Belgian Federal Government|federal government]]. The [[Constitution of Belgium|Belgian Constitution]] stipulates that the [[Monarchy of Belgium|King of Belgium]], in practice the federal government as a whole, is responsible for the execution of laws adopted by the federal parliament. This is done by [[Royal order (Belgium)|royal order]]. For more detailed measures, the minister responsible can act alone by ministerial order. Ministerial orders must be published in the [[Belgian Official Journal]] before they can enter into force.

== Canada ==
[[File:Asian Long-horned Beetle Regulated Area Notice.jpg|thumb|A sign from the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] advising residents of a ministerial order in effect for the area. A similar sign in French may be seen in the background of the photo.]]
In Canada, a ministerial order ({{lang-fr|arrêté ministériel}}) is a decision made by a [[Minister of the Crown]], that does not necessitate the approval of the Cabinet, or the [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]] in Council/[[Governor General of Canada]].&lt;ref name=Canmin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/navigating-government-ministerial-orders|title=Navigating Government: Ministerial Orders|last=Kleiss|first=Karen|work=Edmonton Journal|date=5 September 2012|publisher=Postmedia Inc.|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operations surrounding ministerial orders differs between the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] and the governments of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces of Canada]]. For instance, in [[Alberta]], ministerial orders are not automatically made public.&lt;ref name=Canmin/&gt;

== Spain ==
In [[Spain]], a ministerial decree ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''orden ministerial'') is a [[regulation]] issued by any of the government ministries. In the legal hierarchy, it sits below a ''Real Decreto del Presidente del Gobierno'' (Royal Decree of the [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]]) and a ''Real Decreto del Consejo de Ministros'' (Royal Decree of the [[Council of Ministers (Spain)|Council of Ministers]]). Ministerial decrees are produced not only by ministers in affairs relating to their own departments, but also by delegate commissions formed to deal with matters that affect several ministries.

== United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom a ministerial decree is known as a "ministerial order." Until 2013 there was only one example, the Competition and Service (Utilities) Act 1992 (Commencement No. 1) Order 1992.&lt;ref name="UKMinOrd"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukmo UK Ministerial Orders]. Legislation.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whatdotheyknow"&gt;{{Whatdotheyknow.com|http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/uk_ministerial_orders#incoming-275455|email re UK Ministerial Orders|113280|[[National Archives]]|20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The order was made under powers contained in section 56(2) of the [[Competition and Service (Utilities) Act 1992]], which allowed the Secretary of State to provide for the commencement of the [[Act of Parliament|Act]] "by order". However, presumably due to an oversight in the drafting process, the Act did not provide for such an order to be made by [[statutory instrument]] as defined by the [[Statutory Instruments Act 1946]].&lt;ref name="whatdotheyknow"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; No other commencement orders have been made under the relevant powers, and until 2013 this remained the only "ministerial order" in existence.&lt;ref name="whatdotheyknow"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the ministerial order became a more common type of legislation, as it was used 27 times that year, under the [[Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009]]; such continued in 2016.&lt;ref name="UKMinOrd"/&gt; In 2015, The Sewerage Undertakers (Information) (Revocation) Direction 2015&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukmo/2015/1/contents/created The Sewerage Undertakers (Information) (Revocation) Direction 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; was given under section 202 of the [[Water Industry Act 1991]].

In June 2007 the Office of the [[Premier of Mpumalanga|Premier of the Mpumalanga province]] in South Africa leaked a draft '''Mpumalanga Witchcraft Suppression Bill of 2007'''.&lt;ref name=SAWitches /&gt;

Unlike the ''[[Witchcraft Suppression Act of 1957]]'' (which was directed against [[witch-hunting]]), the proposed Witchcraft Control Act would explicitly acknowledge the existence of witchcraft and criminalise it.

Drafting of the Bill was suspended the following year following opposition from  [[Sangoma|traditional healers]] and [[Neopaganism in South Africa|Neopagans]]  which also led to a review of existing national witchcraft legislation by the [[South African Law Reform Commission]].

==Background==

Despite the ongoing existence of the national ''[[Witchcraft Suppression Act, 1957|Witchcraft Suppression Act of 1957]]''&lt;ref name=WSA&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1957-003.pdf Witchcraft Suppression Act 3 of 1957]&lt;/ref&gt; based on colonial witchcraft legislation, which criminalises the "pretence of witchcraft" and accusations of witchcraft, violent [[witch-hunt]]s have persisted in rural areas of South Africa. Various legislative reforms have been proposed to try and address this complex problem.

The principal tenets of the [[African National Congress|ANC]]'s 1994 National Health Plan with respect to traditional healers include the right of access to traditional practitioners as part of their cultural heritage and belief system and the control of traditional practitioners by a recognised and accepted body so that harmful practices can be eliminated and the profession promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A National Health Plan for South Africa|publisher=anc.org.za|date=30 May 1994|url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ultimately led to the national ''Traditional Health Practitioners Act of 2007''&lt;ref name=THPA&gt;[http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=77788 Traditional Health Practitioners Act 22 of 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; which the [[Department of Health (South Africa)|National Department of Health]] only started to implement in December 2011 under pressure from frustrated traditional healers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shonisani|first=Tshifhiwa|title=Healers threaten poll boycott|publisher=citizen.co.za|date=13 May 2011|url=http://www.citizen.co.za/citizen/content/en/citizen/local-news?oid=194122&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=334&amp;Healers-threaten--poll-boycott|accessdate=16 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521074002/http://www.citizen.co.za/citizen/content/en/citizen/local-news?oid=194122&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=334&amp;Healers-threaten--poll-boycott|archivedate=21 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice of Nominations of Members of the Interim Traditional Health Practitioners Council of South Africa: Traditional Health Practitioners Act, 2007 (Act No. 22 of 2007)|url=http://www.doh.gov.za/docs/forms/2011/nomination_frm.pdf|publisher=doh.gov.za|accessdate=17 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105110602/http://www.doh.gov.za/docs/forms/2011/nomination_frm.pdf|archivedate=5 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 the Minister of Safety and Security of the [[Limpopo|Northern Province]] commissioned the Commission of Enquiry into Witchcraft Violence and Ritual Murder in the Northern Province of the Republic of South Africa chaired by Professor Victor Ralushai. The Committee proposed a new national ''Witchcraft Control Act'' including penalties for practising, or pretending to practise, witchcraft and also recommended new legislation to regulate traditional healers. Unlike the ''Witchcraft Suppression Act of 1957'', the proposed ''Witchcraft Control Act'' would explicitly acknowledge the existence of witchcraft and criminalise it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harnischfeger|first=Johannes|title=Witchcraft and the State in South Africa|url=http://www.africana.ru/biblio/afrocentrism/12_Harnischfeger.htm|publisher=africana.ru|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Niehaus|first=Isak|title=Witchcraft, power, and politics: exploring the occult in the South African lowveld|publisher=David Philip|location=Cape Town|year=2001|isbn=9780745315638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashforth|first=Adam|title=Witchcraft, Violence, and Democracy in South Africa|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2005|isbn=9780226029733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ralushai Commission defined a witch as follows in their report: 

{{quote|The English word witch is gender specific and confined to women only. The male equivalent is wizard. The Sesotho word moloi (pl. baloi) is derived from the verb loya, which means to bewitch and is attributed to those people who, through sheer malice, either consciously or subconsciously, employ magical means to inflict all manner of evil on their fellow human beings. They destroy property, bring disease or misfortune and cause death, often entirely without provocation to satisfy their inherent craving for evil doing. The Tsivenda word for witchcraft is vhuloi. The Nguni equivalent is ukuthakatha (verb) and umthakathi (noun). African terminology referring to witches or wizards is gender neutral (Minnaar et al 1998.)|Report of the Ralushai Commission of Inquiry into Witchcraft Violence and Ritual Murder in the Northern Province&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious discrimination in the new South Africa?|publisher=vuya.net|date=24 July 2006|url=http://www.vuya.net/node/1133|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Testifying before a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] amnesty hearing in July 1999 about his knowledge about witchcraft matters and other related issues, Professor Ralushai defined a witch as follows when requested to do so by practising attorney Patrick Ndou: 

{{quote|A witch is supposed to be a person who is endowed with powers of causing illness or ill luck or death to the person that he wants to destroy.|Professor V N Ralushai|Truth and Reconciliation Commission Amnesty Hearing, Thohoyandou 12 July 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Truth and Reconciliation Commission Amnesty Hearing, Thohoyandou 12 July 1999|publisher=justice.gov.za|date=12 July 1999|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/amntrans/1999/99071214_tho_990712th.htm|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1998 the [[Commission for Gender Equality]] issued the ''Thohoyandou Declaration on Ending Witchcraft Violence'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Commission on Gender Equality|title=The Thohoyandou Declaration on Ending Witchcraft Violence|publisher=vuya.net|date=September 1998|url=http://www.vuya.net/?q=node/1828|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommending urgent legislative reform to mitigate harmful witchcraft practices and violent witch hunts including new legislation to regulate the practices and conduct of traditional healers.

The draft ''Mpumalanga Witchcraft Suppression Bill of 2007'' expanded on the ''Witchcraft Suppression Act of 1957'', defining witchcraft as harmful magic and attempting to regulate the conduct of traditional healers in [[Mpumalanga]].

==Mandate==

The Mpumalanga Department of Local Government was mandated by the Provincial Executive Council to draft a Bill to address the high level of violence in the province caused by allegations of witchcraft.&lt;ref name=suspension&gt;{{cite web|last=Department of Local Government and Housing, Mpumalanga Provincial Government|title=Mpumalanga province suspends the drafting of the provincial Witchcraft Suppression Bill of 2007|publisher=info.gov.za|date=24 June 2008|url=http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/2008/08062412451002.htm|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bill was mentioned in the 2007/08 Budget speech for the Mpumalanga Provincial Government's Department of Local Government and Housing delivered on 31 May 2007: 

{{quote|I am sure that you are all aware that the province is drafting the Mpumalanga Witchcraft Suppression Bill. The purpose of the bill is to suppress Acts of witchcraft including naming and pointing of any body as a wizard or witch. To deal with the violence associated with allegations of witchcraft and deal with killings including ritual killing associated with witchcraft and empowering Traditional leaders to deal with witchcraft aspects.|Honourable MEC C Mashego-Dlamini|Mpumalanga Local Government and Housing Prov Budget Vote, 2007/08&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mpumalanga Provincial Government|title=Mashego-Dlamini: Mpumalanga Local Government and Housing Prov Budget Vote, 2007/08|publisher=polity.org.za|date=31 May 2007|url=http://www.polity.org.za/article/mashegodlamini-mpumalanga-local-government-and-housing-prov-budget-vote-200708-31052007-2007-05-31|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Opposition to the Bill==

In July 2007 members of organisations representing [[Neopaganism in South Africa|Neopagans]] and traditional healers met with officials of the Mpumalanga Provincial Government's Department of Local Government and Housing to discuss their concerns about the Bill from very different cultural viewpoints.&lt;ref name=Healers&gt;{{cite news|last=Hlatshwayo|first=Riot|title=Healers, pagans oppose new witchcraft bill|publisher=sowetanlive.co.za|date=18 July 2007|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/sowetan/archive/2007/07/18/healers-pagans-oppose-new-witchcraft-bill|accessdate=15 October 2012}} "The Traditional Health Organisation (THO) and the South African Pagan Council (SAPC) opposed the bill.

Pagans who self-identify as [[Witchcraft (contemporary)|Witches]], albeit in a contemporary Western sense, objected to the unconstitutional suppression of their religious beliefs and practices and the negative stereotype of witchcraft in the Bill:&lt;ref name=SAWitches&gt;{{cite web|last=Leff|first=Damon|title=S.A.

Traditional healers objected to an ''[[Sangoma|inyanga]]'', a local term for a traditional healer, and ''[[muti]]'', a local term for medicine, being associated with harmful practices and traditional healers effectively being labelled as witches, the witch term having strong negative connotations in an Afrocentric context:&lt;ref name=Healers /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bewitched /&gt;

On 24 June 2008 the Mpumalanga Provincial Government issued a statement that they had suspended drafting of the Bill until further notice after consultation with different stakeholders.&lt;ref name=suspension /&gt;

==South African Law Reform Commission review of witchcraft legislation==

The South African Pagan Rights Alliance first approached the South African Law Reform Commission regarding the constitutionality of the ''Witchcraft Suppression Act of 1957'' in February 2007, prior to the leaking of the Mpumalanga Bill. The South African Law Reform Commission subsequently received further submissions from the South African Pagan Rights Alliance and the Traditional Healers Organization requesting the investigation of the constitutionality of both the ''Witchcraft Suppression Act of 1957'' and the ''Mpumalanga Witchcraft Suppression Bill of 2007''. On 23 March 2010 the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development approved a South African Law Reform Commission project to review witchcraft legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sapra Appeal for legislative reform|publisher=vuya.net|date=10 July 2007|url=http://www.vuya.net/node/2677|accessdate=17 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121220043355/http://www.vuya.net/node/2677|archivedate=20 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Department of Justice and Constitutional Development|title=Current Investigations: Progress Report; Project 135: Review of witchcraft legislation|publisher=justice.gov.za|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/salrc/progress.htm|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions''' ('''OSFI'''; {{lang-fr|Bureau du surintendant des institutions financières}}) is an [[Structure of the Canadian federal government|independent agency]] of the [[Government of Canada]] reporting to the [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] created "to contribute to public confidence in the Canadian financial system". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/O-2.7/253439.html|title=Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the sole regulator of banks, and the primary regulator of insurance companies, trust companies, loan companies and pension plans in Canada.

The current Superintendent is Jeremy Rudin, appointed in June 2014. He replaced [[Julie Dickson]], who retired. The term of the appointment is seven years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/new-osfi-head/article19163329/ "Jeremy Rudin to replace Julie Dickson as head of OSFI", by Tara Perkins and Kevin Carmichael, ''Globe and Mail'', June 13, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; 
== Mandate ==
The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) was created to contribute to public confidence in the Canadian financial system. 

OSFI's role is to:

* Supervise institutions and pension plans to determine whether they are in sound financial condition and meeting minimum plan funding requirements respectively, and are complying with their governing law and supervisory requirements; 
* Promptly advise institutions and plans in the event there are material deficiencies and take or require management, boards or plan administrators to take necessary corrective measures expeditiously; 
* Advance and administer a regulatory framework that promotes the adoption of policies and procedures designed to control and manage risk; 
* Monitor and evaluate system-wide or sectoral issues that may impact institutions negatively. 

OSFI’s legislation has due regard to the need to allow institutions to compete effectively and take reasonable risks. The legislation also recognizes that management, boards of directors and plan administrators are ultimately responsible and that financial institutions and pension plans can fail. 

The Office of the Chief Actuary, which is part of OSFI, provides actuarial services to the Government of Canada.

== History ==
Late 1800s – establishment of the Office of the Superintendent of Insurance (OSI), which subsequently became the Department of Insurance (DOI). The DOI was responsible for overseeing federally licensed life insurance companies, property and casualty insurance companies, trust and loan companies and pension plans, and for providing actuarial services to the government. 

1925 – the Office of the Inspector General of Banks was established in response to the Home Bank failure and was responsible for regulating Canada's chartered banks. 

Early 1930s – [[Royal Commission on Banking and Currency]] reviewed banking and currency issues in the Canadian financial system. 

Early 1960s – Porter Royal Commission reviewed structural and operational issues affecting the financial system and financial institutions in Canada. The Commission's report concluded the financial system was sound, but developments had moved beyond the current state of laws and regulatory practices. Porter argued the public could not be insulated from loss in dealing with public institutions and markets. The Commission called for a system that would provide for adequate disclosure and that would set high standards of self-regulation, backed by strong government supervision and powers to enforce proper practices. 

1967 – the Minister of Finance introduced legislation to establish the [[Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (CDIC) to ensure the safety of small deposits and bring about a gradual improvement in the minimum financial standard of deposit-taking institutions in Canada. In 1983, legislative amendments extended CDIC's mandate to include assisting to maintain public confidence and stability in the financial system. 

Mid-1980s – increased international competition and the failure of two Canadian banks and the subsequent enquiry into these failures by the Honourable Willard Z. Estey highlighted the need to ensure a sound approach to handling the risks associated with the financial marketplace. 

July 1987 – to ensure a coordinated approach to supervision and a modern regulatory framework for Canada's financial system, and acting on the recommendations of the Estey commission, the government proclaimed the Financial Institutions and Deposit Insurance Amendment Act and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act. This latter Act joined the Department of Insurance and the Office of the Inspector General of Banks to form OSFI, which was given the powers to supervise and regulate all federally regulated financial institutions. 

May 1996 – Bill C-15 receives Royal Assent. This new legislation clarifies OSFI's prime responsibilities as helping to minimize losses to depositors, policy holders, and pension plan members and to maintain public confidence in the Canadian financial system. Preventing failure of financial institutions is not part of OSFI's mandate; however, promoting sound business practices helps reduce the risk that financial institutions will fail. The mandate stresses the importance of early intervention to achieve OSFI's objectives and establishes the basis for OSFI's mission, objectives, priorities and strategies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1568">'''Ovoferrin''' was a [[Patent medicine|tonic]] originally produced in the [[United States]] by A.C. Barnes Company&lt;ref name=barnes/&gt; of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref name=zonite/&gt; and later by [[Zonite Products Corporation]], which acquired A.C. Barnes Company in 1929.&lt;ref name=barnes&gt;''Inquiring Investor'', [[Wall Street Journal]], November 29, 1930, pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The product grossed approximately $400,000 annually in 1929.&lt;ref name=zonite&gt;''Zonite Capital Plan Approved'', Wall Street Journal, July 12, 1929, pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Ovoferrin and [[Argyrol]] continued to be exclusively manufactured by A.C.

On January 2, 1946 Ovoferrin and Argyrol were assigned to [[Erwin, Wasey &amp; Company]], a [[New York City|New York]] based advertising agency.&lt;ref&gt;''Advertising News and Notes'', [[New York Times]], October 10, 1945, pg. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical composition==

Ovoferrin's manufacturer described its makeup as being neutral in reaction. A tablespoon was stated to be equivalent to a single grain of elementary [[iron]]. When [[potassium ferrocyanide]] is added to Ovorferrin no change is observed. However the addition of [[hydrochloric acid]] to Ovoferrin produces a well-known color and precipitate of [[Prussian blue]]. This indicates that hydrochloric acid changes Ovoferrin, producing an [[inorganic]]
iron.&lt;ref&gt;''American Druggist and Pharmaceutical Record'', American Druggist Publishing Company, 1904, pg. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Polity (disambiguation)}}

A '''polity''' is any kind of political entity. It is a group of people who are collectively united by a self-reflected cohesive force such as [[Identity (social science)|identity]], who have a capacity to mobilize [[resource]]s, and are organized by some form of [[institutionalization|institutionalized]] [[hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Yale, &amp; [[Richard W. Mansbach]] (1996) "Polities: Authority, Identities, and Change", Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'']]

==Overview==
A polity can be manifested in many different forms, such as a [[state (polity)|state]], an [[empire]], an [[international organization]], a [[political organization]] and other identifiable, resource-manipulating organizational structures. A polity, like a state, does not need to be a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] unit. The most preeminent polities today are [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian]] states and [[nation-state]]s, commonly referred to as "[[nation]]s".

It therefore encapsulates a vast multitude of organizations, many of which form the fundamental apparatus of contemporary states such as their subordinate [[civil authorities|civil]] and [[local government]] authorities.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''Black's Law Dictionary'', 4th ed., West Publishing Co., (1968), and ''Uricich v. Kolesar'', 54 Ohio App. 309, 7 N.E. 2d 413.&lt;/ref&gt; Polities do not need to be in control of any geographic areas, as not all political entities and [[government]]s have controlled the resources of one fixed geographic area. The historical [[nomadic empire|Steppe Empires]] originating from the [[Eurasian Steppe]] are the most prominent example of non-[[sedentism|sedentary]] polities. These polities differ from ''states'' because of their lack of a fixed, defined territory. ''Empires'' also differ from ''states'' in that their territories are not statically defined or permanently fixed, and consequently that their body politic was also dynamic and fluid.

It is useful, then, to think of a polity as a political community. A polity can be defined either as a faction within a larger (usually state) entity or, at different times, as the entity itself. Kurds in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], for example, are parts of their own separate and distinct polity. They are also, though, members of the sovereign state of Iraq which is itself a polity, albeit one which is much less specific and, as a result, much less cohesive. It is therefore possible for an individual to belong to more than one polity at a time.

[[Thomas Hobbes]] was a highly significant figure in the [[concept]]ualisation of polities, and in particular of states. Hobbes considered notions of the state and the [[body politic]] in his most notable work, ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', (1651); http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/hobbes; accessed 25 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In previous centuries, ''body politic'' was also understood to mean "the physical person of the sovereign:" [[emperor]], [[monarch|king]] or [[dictator]] in monarchies and despotisms, and the electorate in republics. As many polities have become more democratic in the last few centuries the body politic, where sovereignty is bestowed, has grown to a much greater size than simply the ruling elite, such as the [[monarchy]]. In present times, it may also refer to the representation of a group, such as ones drawn along ethnic or gender lines. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}} [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinets]] in [[liberal democracy|liberal]] [[Democracy|democracies]] are chosen to represent the body politic.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

{{Prerogative writs}}
In British and American [[common law]], '''''quo warranto''''' ([[Latin language|Medieval Latin]] for "by what warrant?") is a [[prerogative writ]] requiring the person to whom it is directed to show what authority they have for exercising some right, power, or [[exclusive right|franchise]] they claim to hold.

==Early history==
With the spread of royal justice in the 12th and 13th centuries, private franchises and liberties were increasingly called upon to uphold the king's peace: to act against "malefactors and peace breakers, so that it may appear that you are a lover of our peace".&lt;ref&gt;Henry III, 1237, in [[Helen Cam]] ''Law-finders and Law-makers'' (London 1962) p. 38-9.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1218 onwards,&lt;ref&gt;Helen Cam ''Law-finders and Law-makers'' (London 1962) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; royal [[Eyre (legal term)|Eyres]] also began using the old [[writ]] of ''quo warranto'' – a court order to show proof of authority, as for example (literally) "By what warrant are you the sheriff?" – to investigate the origins of such franchises.&lt;ref&gt;S. H. Steinberg (ed.), ''A New Dictionary of British History'' (London 1963) p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; An inquest of 1255 began examining such liberties nationwide;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Cam, ''Law-finders and Law-makers'' (London 1962) pp. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; and the same enquiry was taken up again by King [[Edward I of England]] in 1278, when he decreed in the [[Statute of Gloucester]] that "We must find out what is ours, and due to us, and others what is theirs, and due to them".&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Tanner ed., ''The Cambridge Medieval History Vol VII'' (C 1932), p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

From one point of view this can be seen as an attempt to investigate and recover royal lands, rights, and franchises in [[England]],&lt;ref name=Clanchy3&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; in particular those lost during the reign of his father, [[King Henry III of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | page = 74 | last = Harris | first = Nicholas |author2=[[Charles Purton Cooper]]  | title = Public Records | year = 1831 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |isbn=978-1-85285-137-8 |page=88 |last=Carpenter |first=David A. |title=The reign of Henry III | year = 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From another, it was less of an attack on franchises as a clarification of them: in [[Hilda Johnstone]]'s words, "Edward's aim, it is clear, was from the first not abolition but definition".&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Tanner ed., ''The Cambridge Medieval History Vol VII'' (C 1932) p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar ambiguity surrounds the role of the justices that, from 1278 to 1294, Edward dispatched throughout the [[Kingdom of England]] to inquire "by what warrant" English lords claimed their liberties and exercised jurisdiction, including the right to hold a court and collect its profits. Some of the justices demanded written proof in the form of charters, others accepted a plea of "Immemorial tenure";&lt;ref&gt;Helen Cam ''Law-finders and Law-makers'' (London 1962) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; and resistance{{citeneeded|date=September 2017}} and the unrecorded nature of many grants meant that eventually, by the Statute of Quo Warranto (1290), the principle was generally accepted that those rights peacefully exercised since 1189 – the beginning of the reign of Richard I, which is the legal definition in England of the phrase "[[time immemorial]]"&lt;ref name=Clanchy3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clanchy152&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'', p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; – were legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;S. H. Steinberg (ed.), ''A New Dictionary of British History'' (London 1963), p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Publication===
The ''Quo warranto'' pleas from the reigns of Edward I, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] and [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] were published by the [[Record Commission]] in 1818.

==Later developments==
The most famous historical instance of ''quo warranto'' was the action taken against the [[Corporation of London]] by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1683.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Informations (criminal and quo warranto) mandamus and prohibition|series=American law series|first=John|last=Shortt|publisher=C. H. Edson and company|year=1888 |page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPE_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King's Bench]] adjudged the charter and franchises of the City of London to be forfeited to the Crown, though this judgment was reversed by the [[London, Quo Warranto Judgment Reversed Act 1689]] shortly after the [[Glorious Revolution]].

But the remodelling of the City of London was only part of a wider remodelling of some forty chartered parliamentary boroughs by the Crown&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Plumb, ''The Growth of Political Stability in England'' (London 1986) pp. 55-6.&lt;/ref&gt; – a policy taken up again in 1688 by [[James II of England|James II]], when some thirty-five new charters were issued after quo warranto produced the surrender of the old ones.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ashley, ''The Glorious Revolution'' (London 1966) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; This Quo Warranto remodelling or 'dissolution' of the parliamentary corporations gave point to the claim by [[William III of England|William III]] that "our expedition is intended for no other design but to have a free and lawful parliament assembled", and underpinned the charge in the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] that James had been "violating the freedom of election by members to serve in parliament".&lt;ref&gt;M. Ashley, ''The Glorious Revolution'' (London 1966) pp. 205–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quo warranto today==

In the [[United States]] today, ''quo warranto'' usually arises in a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] case as a [[plaintiff]]'s claim (and thus a "[[cause of action]]" instead of a writ) that some governmental or corporate official was not validly elected to that office or is wrongfully exercising powers beyond (or ''[[ultra vires]]'') those authorized by statute or by the corporation's charter.

In some jurisdictions that have enacted [[judicial review]] statutes, the prerogative writ of ''quo warranto'' has been abolished. This includes [[Queensland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/jra1991158/s42.html Sn 42 Abolition of quo warranto], ''Judicial Review Act 1991'', Queensland Consolidated Acts.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sca1970183/s12.html Sn 12 Quo Warranto] ''Supreme Court Act 1970'', New South Wales Consolidated Acts.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Race Equality Directive''' [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32000L0043 2000/43/EC] is an Act of the [[European Union]], concerning [[European labour law]]. It implements the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnic origin]]. Since the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] came into force in 1999, new EC laws, or Directives, have been enacted in the area of anti-discrimination, and this Directive complements other Directives on gender and age, disability, religion and sexual orientation.

==Overview==
The principle rules laid down are as follows:

# Implements the principle of equal treatment between people irrespective of racial or ethnic origin.
# Gives protection against discrimination in employment and training, education, social protection (including social security and healthcare), social advantages, membership and involvement in organisations of workers and employers and access to goods and services, including housing.
# Contains definitions of direct and indirect discrimination and harassment and prohibits the instruction to discriminate and [[victimisation]].
# Allows for positive action measures to be taken, in order to ensure full equality in practice.
# Gives victims of discrimination a right to make a complaint through a judicial or administrative procedure, associated with appropriate penalties for those who discriminate.
# Allows for limited exceptions to the principle of equal treatment, for example in cases where a difference in treatment on the ground of race or ethnic origin constitutes a genuine occupational requirement.
# Shares the burden of proof between the complainant and the respondent in civil and administrative cases, so that once an alleged victim establishes facts from which it may be presumed that there has been discrimination, it is for the respondent to prove that there has been no breach of the equal treatment principle.
# Provides for the establishment in each Member State of an organisation to promote equal treatment and provide independent assistance to victims of racial discrimination.

'''''San-nakji''''' ({{Korean|hangul=산낙지|labels=no}}) is a variety of ''[[Hoe (food)|hoe]]'' (raw dish) made with [[Octopus minor|long arm octopus]] (''Octopus minor''), a small octopus species called ''nakji'' in Korean and is sometimes translated into "baby octopus" due to its relatively small size compared to the [[Enteroctopus dofleini|giant octopus]] (''Enteroctopus dofleini'').&lt;ref name="SKLD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stdweb2.korean.go.kr/search/View.jsp?idx=11991|title=san-nakji|website=[[Standard Korean Language Dictionary]]|publisher=[[National Institute of Korean Language]]|language=ko|script-title=ko:산낙지|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The octopuses are most commonly killed before being cut into small pieces and served, with the nerve activity in the octopus' tentacles making the pieces move posthumously on the plate whilst served.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/korean-restaurant-live-octopus-dish-animal-rights-activists-squirming-article-1.444306|title=Korean restaurant's live Octopus dish has animal rights activists squirming|last=Rosen|first=Daniel Edward|date=4 May 2010|work=[[New York Daily News]]|access-date=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2017/05/123_65910.html|title=Clash of culture?

==Eating==
Because the suction cups on the arm pieces are still active when the dish is served, special care should be taken when eating sannakji. The active suction cups can cause swallowed pieces of arm to stick to the mouth or throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food/food-features/Eight-controversial-foods-from-around-the-world/articleshow/47564867.cms|title=Eight controversial foods from around the world|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can also present a choking hazard for some people, particularly if they are intoxicated. 

==Language difference==
[[North–South differences in the Korean language|Vocabularies in the two Koreas differ]] on ''nakji'': South Koreans call ''[[Octopus minor]]'', a small kind of octopus (often mistranslated as "baby octopus") ''nakji'', while North Koreans call a [[squid]] ''nakji'' (''nakchi'' in [[McCune–Reischauer]] romanization).

==Prevalence==
''Sannakji'' is served in [[Korean restaurant]]s that serve sliced raw fish,  but it  also can be found at bars as a snack to accompany alcoholic beverages, such as [[soju]]. 

==Health hazard==
Consuming ''sannakji'' is potentially dangerous due to [[Choking|choking hazard]]. Because the cephalopod's limbs contain neurons, the extremities continue to move and the suction cups along its tentacles maintain their gripping power that might attach to one's throat, even after getting detached from the body and dosed with sesame oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2014-03-19/most-dangerous-foods|title=The Most Dangerous Foods in the World|work=Condé Nast Traveler|access-date=2018-01-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several incidents of choking on ''Sannakji'' have been reported, such as a 2008 incident in [[Gwangju]].&lt;ref&gt; [[Yonhap News]] 2008-01-21  [http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0001931575 광주서 산낙지 먹다 기도막힌 사고 잇따라]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scotland Act 2012''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It sets out amendments to the [[Scotland Act 1998]], with the aim of [[devolving]] further powers to [[Scotland]] in accordance with the recommendations of the Calman Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Kenneth, "Implementing the Financial Powers in the Scotland Act 2012", Scottish Parliamentary Review, Vol. I, No. 2 (Jan, 2014) [Edinburgh: Blacket Avenue Press]&lt;/ref&gt; It received Royal Assent in 2012.

==Main Provisions==
The Act gave extra powers to the Scottish Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|year=2012|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/11/contents/enacted|title=Scotland Act 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably:

* The ability to raise or lower [[Scottish income tax|income tax]] by up to 10p in the pound. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|year=2012|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/11/part/3/crossheading/scottish-rate-of-income-tax/enacted|title=Scotland Act 2012, Scottish rate of income tax}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Devolving [[Land and Buildings Transaction Tax|stamp duty]] and [[Scottish Landfill Tax|landfill tax]] to [[Scotland]].
* The Scottish Parliament will have the ability to borrow up to £5 billion.
* Legislative control over [[Driving under the influence|drink driving limits]]
* Creation of [[Revenue Scotland]], a tax authority for Scottish devolved taxes while [[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]] still collects taxes that are not devolved to Scotland

==Calman Commission==
{{main|Commission on Scottish Devolution}}
The proposed legislation was based on the final report of the [[Calman Commission]], which was established by an opposition Labour Party [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] in the [[Scottish Parliament]] in December 2007, against the wishes of the [[Scottish National Party]] [[minority government]].

Professor [[Jim Gallagher (civil servant)|Jim Gallagher]], the civil servant who drafted the Bill, was appointed to advise the [[Scotland Bill Committee of the Scottish Parliament]], convened by [[Wendy Alexander]], whose Parliamentary motion started the whole Calman process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/politics/professor-who-drew-up-bill-to-advise-on-scrutiny-1.1073556|title=Professor who drew up Bill to advise on scrutiny|last=Dinwoodie|first=Robbie|date=10 December 2010|work=The Herald|accessdate=13 December 2010|location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passage==
The Bill was presented to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]], [[Michael Moore (UK politician)|Michael Moore]], on [[St Andrew's Day]] (30 November), 2010, and received an unopposed second reading on 27 January 2012.
 
The [[UK government]] stated that it would not pass the bill unless it had obtained a legislative consent motion from the [[Scottish Parliament]],&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-16194465|title=MSPs 'unable to recommend' Scotland Bill plan|date=15 December 2011|work=BBC News Scotland|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Parliament of the United Kingdom could have passed the Bill in any case.&lt;ref&gt;S. MacNab, [http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/scotland_bill_parties_split_as_snp_threatens_to_block_transfer_of_powers_1_2012089 "Scotland Bill: Parties split as SNP threatens to block transfer of powers"], The Scotsman, (16 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The governing [[Scottish National Party]] indicated that it planned to block the bill.&lt;ref name="Jones1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/politics/Peter-Jones-Scotland39s-future-in.6847209.jp|title=Before May, it was assumed that even if the SNP opposed them, the unionist parties would have voted them through the Scottish Parliament. Of course, thanks to the SNP winning a majority, they now no longer have the power to do that. Indeed, the SNP has the power to block the transfer of powers. Last week's meeting of the Scottish Parliament committee examining the Scotland Bill's provisions made it pretty clear that the SNP is preparing the ground to do exactly that.|last=Jones|first=Peter|date=4 October 2011|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=4 October 2011|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/scotland/article3260200.ece|title=Scotland Bill stalls as SNP clashes with Westminster|last=Jones|first=Peter|author2=Macleod, Angus |date=16 December 2011|work=The Times|accessdate=16 December 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a deal was reached between the two governments on 21 March 2012,&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-17458231 "Holyrood to be given new income tax and borrowing powers"]. ''BBC News Online'', (21 March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; the Scottish Parliament unanimously passed a legislative consent motion in respect of the Bill on 18 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-17747502 "MSPs endorse new Holyrood powers under Scotland Bill"], ''BBC News Online'', (18 April 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction and analysis==
The Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore, described the legislation as the largest transfer of fiscal powers from central Government since the [[Treaty of Union|creation of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://breakingnews.heraldscotland.com/breaking-news/?mode=article&amp;site=hs&amp;id=N0403941296156340260A|title=Commons clears transfer of powers|date=28 January 2011|work=The Herald|accessdate=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Scottish National Party supported some parts of the Bill as introduced, it opposed others. In particular, it considered that the income tax proposals were flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scotland-bill-parties-split-as-snp-threatens-to-block-transfer-of-powers-1-2012089 |title=Scotland Bill: Parties split as SNP threatens to block transfer of powers}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the SNP agreed to support the Bill, after the proposals to return certain powers were dropped,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-17747502|title=MSPs endorse new Holyrood powers under Scotland Bill|publisher=BBC|date=18 April 2012|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and agreement was reached that the details of the income tax changes would be subject to approval by MSPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/political-news/msps-approve-scotland-bill.17318480|title=MSPs approve Scotland Bill|publisher=The Herald|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Bill received legislative consent from the Scottish Parliament, the [[Cabinet Secretary for Parliamentary Business and Government Strategy]], [[Bruce Crawford]], [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] argued that, although the Bill would not harm Scottish interests, it represented a missed opportunity and had been overtaken by events, in particular the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2011|return of an SNP majority government]] in 2011 and the consequent [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|independence referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stornowaygazette.co.uk/news/scottish-headlines/msps-back-holyrood-powers-boost-1-2239982# "MSPs back Holyrood powers boost"], ''Stornoway Gazette'', (18 April 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a proposal to amend section 57(2) of the [[Scotland Act 1998]], which provides that the [[Lord Advocate]], as a member of the [[Scottish Executive]], has no power to do anything in contravention of the European Convention rights.  Given that, alongside being the adviser to and representative of the Scottish Government in Scots law, the Lord Advocate is head of the system of criminal prosecution in Scotland and every prosecution in a Scottish court proceeds with his/her authority, this provision effectively allows any human rights issue raised in any criminal proceedings in Scotland effectively to be appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]] as a constitutional "devolution issue".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawscot.org.uk/news/press-releases/2011/february/news_20110228 The Law Society of Scotland, news statement]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court consists of two Supreme Court judges from Scotland and 10 judges from other parts of the United Kingdom.  When hearing appeals the Supreme Court sits with a bench of at least five judges, so even if both Scottish judges are present for a Scottish appeal, the majority of the bench will be judges who may not be especially well versed in Scots law and criminal procedure.  According to [[David Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead|Lord Hope of Craighead]], the Deputy President of the Supreme Court, non-Scottish judges will in practice defer to their Scottish colleagues in Scottish cases, and often simply concur with judgements written by the Scottish judges.  However, the situation is seen by some, including the [[Scottish Government]], as undermining the status of the [[High Court of Justiciary]] as the final court of appeal in criminal matters in Scots law, and even of undermining the integrity of Scots law.  The [[Advocate General for Scotland]] asked an expert group, chaired by [[Sir David Edward]], to consider this issue and make recommendations, which led to the amendments to the Scotland Bill proposed by the UK Government.  The Scottish Government remains concerned that the amendments may not fully address the issue, particularly as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court in [[Fraser v HM Advocate]], and appointed their own expert group, chaired by [[Lord McCluskey]], to consider the matter and report back.

'''The Anglo-Oriental  Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade''', generally known by the somewhat shorter name of '''Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade''' ('''SSOT'''), was a British lobbying group in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, opposed to the [[Opium#Prohibition and conflict in China|opium trade]].

==History==

In 1874 a group of Quaker businessmen offered a £200 prize for the best essay on the British opium trade. The winner, [[Frederick Storrs-Turner|Rev. Frederick Storrs-Turner]], announced his intent to set up a society to oppose the trade, and at a meeting in November of that year the Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade was formed. Rev. Storrs-Turner became the society's secretary, and the funds for its foundation were provided by [[Quaker]] and industrialist [[Pease family (Darlington)|Edward Pease]] (1834–1880) (brother of [[Sir Joseph Pease, 1st Baronet|Sir Joseph Pease]], who was later to be president of the society).&lt;ref name="Schwarz1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Bill Schwarz]]|title=The Expansion of England: Race, Ethnicity and Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p18OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA241|accessdate=28 May 2012|date=6 March 1996|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-06025-7|pages=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janin1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hunt Janin|title=The India-China Opium Trade in the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LK12iessxcwC&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=23 May 2012|date=1 October 1999|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-0715-6|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first president was [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|the Earl of Shaftsbury]], although he was not elected to the post until 1880.&lt;ref name="Coats1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.W.

The society quickly became a focal point for the anti-opium movement. Initially, it campaigned on two fronts: lobbying for the British Government to cease its military and diplomatic pressures on China to allow opium imports&lt;ref name="Lodwick1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen L. Lodwick|title=Crusaders Against Opium: Protestant Missionaries in China, 1874-1917|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gT42B-69owoC&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=23 May 2012|year=1996|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-1924-3|pages=55–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; and removing direct government involvement in the trade in India.&lt;ref name="Coats1995"/&gt; After the [[Chefoo Convention]] of 1876, when the British Government ceased to pressurise China into allowing opium imports, the Society turned its attention to the Indian production of opium, advocating total prohibition in India except for medical use.&lt;ref name="Coats1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chouvy2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre-Arnaud Chouvy|title=Opium: Uncovering the Politics of the Poppy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGl4TN_qIsgC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=23 May 2012|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05134-8|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Society commanded considerable support in China, partly as a result of its connections to Quaker missions and partly due to the diplomatic efforts of the Society's secretary, Joseph Gundry Alexander (1848-1918),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaker.org.uk/search-catalogue J.G. Alexander's writings are listed in the catalogue of the Religious Society of Friends, London]&lt;/ref&gt; who travelled to China in 1894 and met with many government representatives there to discuss the opium issue. As a result of his report, the Society adopted the view that Chinese condemnation of the opium trade was widespread, a belief at odds with that of the British public.&lt;ref name="Lodwick1996"/&gt; Like many similar organisations, the Society was composed largely of upper- and middle-class politicians, landowners and clergy, and its aims were largely irrelevant to the majority of the British working population.&lt;ref name="Gerritsen2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan-Willem Gerritsen|title=The Control of Fuddle and Flash: A Sociological History of the Regulation of Alcohol and Opiates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5T2UzjucWjYC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=23 May 2012|year=2000|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11640-5|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its large Quaker membership, the Society often had a religious tone to its meetings, with prayers and discussion of Biblical content being common. Other Christian organisations, such as the Church of England, were also active in the anti-opium movement. Whilst there were agnostic crusaders against the trade, such as [[John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn|John Morley]], this religious sentiment was seized upon by the pro-opium movement, who dismissed the Society's message as histrionic "hellfire and brimstone" preaching.&lt;ref name="Lodwick1996"/&gt;

In his capacity as the Society's president, Sir Joseph Pease attempted to pass a motion in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1891 to declare the opium trade "morally indefensible" and remove Government support for it. The motion failed to pass (despite majority support in the House) due to an amendment calling for compensation to India, but it brought the anti-opium campaign into the public eye and increased opposition to the trade.&lt;ref name="Lodwick1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TraverGaylord1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold Traver|author2=Mark S. Gaylord|title=Drugs, Law, and the State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_1AaddjrJkC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=23 May 2012|year=1992|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-56000-082-2|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society's campaigning resulted in the creation of a [[Royal Commission on Opium]], but although a member of the Society ([[Arthur Pease (MP)|Arthur Pease]]) was on the Commission, its findings were firmly in favour of the trade.&lt;ref name="Tiedemann2009"/&gt; As a result, the aims of the anti-opium movement were set back considerably; it was fifteen years before the issue was again debated in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumler|first=Alan|title=The Chinese and Opium under the Republic: Worse Than Floods and Wild Beasts|year=2007|publisher=[[State University of New York]]|isbn=978-0-7914-6953-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfAKoolkV-wC|accessdate=21 August 2011|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, the motion proposed by Pease in 1891 was once again put before Parliament. This time it was successful, and in response the Chinese passed laws prohibiting the manufacture of opium. The Society disbanded in 1917, having achieved its goals when the British finally ended the opium trade between India and China in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crusaders Against Opium: Protestant Missionaries in China, 1874-1917.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19192678.html|publisher=International Bulletin of Missionary Research via [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required)|accessdate=24 May 2012|date=January 1, 1997|author=Dunch, Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The society published a regular newspaper, ''The Friend of China'', which appeared, on average, eight times each year and was circulated both in the United Kingdom and among missionary communities in China. Rev. Storrs-Turner was the editor. It also published books condemning the opium trade, such as [[Joshua Rowntree]]'s ''The Imperial Drug Trade'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www02.us.archive.org/details/cu31924023283389 ''The imperial drug trade.''(1906 edition), available online]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Benjamin Broomhall]] ''The Truth About Opium Smoking''.&lt;ref name="Lodwick1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/truthaboutopiums00broo#page/n3/mode/2up Benjamin Broomhall ''The Truth About Opium Smoking'' available online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13020">A '''status of forces agreement''' ('''SOFA''') is an agreement between a host country and a foreign nation stationing military forces in that country. SOFAs are often included, along with other types of military agreements, as part of a comprehensive security arrangement. A SOFA does not constitute a security arrangement; it establishes the rights and privileges of foreign personnel present in a host country in support of the larger security arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;R. Chuck Mason, [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL34531.pdf Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA): What Is It, and How Might One Be Utilized In Iraq?], March 15, 2012, Congressional Research Service.&lt;/ref&gt; Under international law a status of forces agreement differs from [[military occupation]].

==Agreements==
While the [[United States military]] has the largest foreign presence and therefore accounts for most SOFAs, the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Australia]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]], and many other nations also station military forces abroad and negotiate SOFAs with their host countries. In the past, the [[Soviet Union]] had SOFAs with most of its [[satellite state]]s. While most of the United States' SOFAs are public, some remain classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Terms of operation===
A SOFA is intended to clarify the terms under which the foreign military is allowed to operate. Typically, purely military operational issues such as the locations of bases and access to facilities are covered by separate agreements. A SOFA is more concerned with the legal issues associated with military individuals and property. This may include issues such as entry and exit into the country, tax liabilities, postal services, or employment terms for host-country nationals, but the most contentious issues are civil and criminal jurisdiction over bases and personnel. For civil matters, SOFAs provide for how civil damages caused by the forces will be determined and paid. Criminal issues vary, but the typical provision in U.S. SOFAs is that U.S. courts will have jurisdiction over crimes committed either by a servicemember against another servicemember or by a servicemember as part of his or her military duty, but the host nation retains jurisdiction over other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Host nation concerns===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2008}}

In many host nations, especially those with a large foreign military presence such as [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]], the SOFA can become a major political issue following crimes allegedly committed by servicemembers. This is especially true when the incidents involve crimes such as [[robbery]], [[murder]], [[manslaughter]] or sex crimes, especially when the charge is defined differently in the two nations. For example, in 2002 in South Korea, a U.S. military [[Armoured vehicle-launched bridge|AVLB]] bridge-laying vehicle on the way to the base camp after a training exercise accidentally killed two girls. Under the SOFA, a United States military [[court martial]] tried the soldiers involved. The panel found the act to be an accident and acquitted the service members of negligent homicide, citing no criminal [[Intention (criminal law)|intent]] or [[Criminal negligence|negligence]]. The U.S. military accepted responsibility for the incident and paid civil damages. This resulted in widespread outrage in South Korea, demands that the soldiers be retried in a South Korean court, the airing of a wide variety of conspiracy theories, and a backlash against the local expatriate community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

As of 2011, American military authorities are allowing South Korea to charge and prosecute American soldiers in South Korean courts. After three brutal rapes and an arson case in 2011, convictions in South Korean courts occurred. The soldiers are, or will soon be, jailed in South Korean facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url= http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/korea-based-u-s-soldier-gets-3-years-in-prison-for-rape-conviction-1.168182

|year=2011 
|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Soon after the rapes and other instances, the peninsula wide military curfew was reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url= http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/curfew-put-in-place-for-all-u-s-troops-in-south-korea-1.157192

|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most crimes by servicemembers against local civilians occur off duty,{{fact|date=September 2018}} and in accordance with the particular SOFA are considered subject to local jurisdiction. Details of the SOFAs can still prompt issues. In Japan, for example, the SOFA includes the provision that service members are not turned over to the local authorities until they are charged in a court.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.niraikanai.wwma.net/pages/archive/sofa.html U.S.-Japan Status of forces Agreement, 19 January 1960]'' (Article XVII, Section 5c)&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of cases, local officials have complained that this impedes their ability to question suspects and investigate the crime. American officials allege that the Japanese police use coercive interrogation tactics and are concerned more with attaining a high conviction rate than finding "justice". American authorities also note the difference in police investigation powers, as well as the judiciary. No lawyer can be present in investigation discussions in Japan, though a translator is provided, and no mention made of an equivalent to America's [[Miranda rights]]. Another issue is the lack of jury trials in Japan, previous to 2009 all trials were decided by a judge or panel of judges. Currently, Japan uses a [[Juries in Japan|lay judge]] system in some criminal trials. For these reasons American authorities insist that service members be tried in military tribunals and reject article 98 of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Giampiero Buonomo, ''L'impossibilità (giuridica) degli accordi bilaterali per sottrarsi alla giurisdizione'', Diritto e giustizia online, 12/9/2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political issues===
The political issue of SOFAs is complicated by the fact that many host countries have mixed feelings about foreign bases on their soil, and demands to renegotiate the SOFA are often combined with calls for foreign troops to leave entirely. Issues of different national customs can arise – while the U.S. and host countries generally agree on what constitutes a crime, many U.S. observers feel that host country justice systems grant a much weaker set of protections to the accused than the U.S. and that the host country's courts can be subject to popular pressure to deliver a guilty verdict; furthermore, that American servicemembers ordered to a foreign posting should not be forced to give up the rights they are afforded under the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. On the other hand, host country observers, having no local counterpart to the Bill of Rights, often feel that this is an irrelevant excuse for demanding special treatment, and resembles the [[Extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] agreements demanded by Western countries during colonialism. One host country where such sentiment is widespread, South Korea, itself has forces in [[Kyrgyzstan]] and has negotiated a SOFA that confers total immunity to its servicemembers from prosecution by Kyrgyz authorities for any crime whatsoever, something far in excess of the privileges many South Koreans object to in their nation's SOFA with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

To many U.S. observers, the fact that most accused criminals eventually end up being tried in a local court and found guilty proves that the system is working; to some host country observers, it reinforces the perception that the SOFA protects the guilty and makes the exceptions more glaring.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

'''Third Country National''' ('''TCN''') is a term often used in the context of [[Human migration|migration]], referring to individuals who are in transit and/or applying for visas in countries that are not their country of origin (i.e. country of transit), in order to go to destination countries that is likewise not their country of origin. In the [[European Union]], the term is often used, together with "[[foreign national]]" and "non-EU foreign national", to refer to individuals who are neither from the EU country in which they are currently living or staying, nor from other [[member states of the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/thirdcountrynationals.htm Definition of "Third Country National"] on the [[Eurofound]] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of employment, the term is often used to designate "an employee working temporarily in an assignment country, who is neither a national of the assignment country nor of the country in which the corporate headquarters is located."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/614567-1.html "Strategic employment of third country nationals: keys to sustaining the transformation of HR functions"], by Calvin Reynolds, ''All Business'', 1 March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, it is often used to describe individuals of other nationalities hired by a government or government sanctioned contractor who represent neither the contracting government nor the host country or area of operations. This is most often those performing on government contracts in the role of a [[private military contractor]].  The term can also be used to describe [[foreign worker]]s employed by private industry and citizens in a country such as [[Kuwait]] in which it is common to outsource work to non-citizens.

== Refugees ==
According to [[IRIN]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Unlike refugees who are protected by international conventions, third-country nationals (TCNs), who neither belong to the country of refuge or the one they fled, are not covered by any global rights conventions. It is often up to their governments to look after them and arrange for their repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Use of the term in the US ==
Generally speaking, the US government classifies contract personnel under one of three headings:
*Ex-pat - those personnel who are of the same nationality as the contracting government. (In Iraq, foreign nationals working as a member of a US contractor are regarded as Ex-pats)
*TCN or Third Country National – those personnel of a separate nationality to both the contracting government and the AO or "Area of operations".
*HCN's (Host country nationals), LN's (Local Nationals), Indigs (Indigenous Personnel) – those personnel who are indigenous to the area of operations.
Examples of this hierarchy are as follows:

Contract personnel being used by the US government to fight the global war on terror in Iraq consist of Expats, namely those personnel of US citizenship that represent a private military contractor being contracted by the US Government, Indigenous Iraqi and Kurdish personnel and TCNs such as  are currently being employed by many of the Private Military Contracting Firms currently under contract.

[[Image:Third Country National in Iraq.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A TCN living on a US military base near Fallujah, Iraq]]TCNs such as have been employed by the United States military (through contractors) for operations in the Middle East for many years. The accommodations, security, and treatment of TCNs can vary greatly from the way that U.S. and multinational coalition personnel are treated. Their contracts often require them to work for four years continuously without a break to return to their home countries. Many TCN contractors have also been lured by preemployment deals that have guaranteed them the job as long as they give a percentage of their pay to an 'employment agent' or 'representative'. TCN housing compounds are generally in less secure areas outside of the main base.  As a result, many TCNs in such high-risk areas have been injured or killed, however most military installations will provide life-saving medical care as required.

Since April 2006, the Pentagon now demands that contractors fight labor trafficking and low quality working conditions in Iraq endured by tens of thousands of low-paid south Asians working under US-funded contracts in Iraq.

In an April 19 memorandum&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidphinney.com/pages/TCN%20Memo%2004-19-20061.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; to all Pentagon contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Joint Contracting Command demands that the widespread practice of taking away workers passports come to end. Contractors engaging in the practice, states the memo, must immediately "cease and desist."

"All passports will be returned to employees by 1 May 06. This requirement will be flowed down to each of your subcontractors performing work in this theater."

Despite the Pentagon crackdown, civilian contractors still report problems of poor working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/story/57974/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of the term in Europe ==
{{Schengen Agreement Labelled Map 2|300px}}
{{Supranational European Bodies|size=upright=1.2|align=left}}
In Europe, the word ''third country national'' is often used for any person who is not a [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizen of the European Union]] within the meaning of Art. 20(1) of [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|TFEU]] and who is not a person enjoying the [[Citizens’ Rights Directive|European Union right to free movement]], as defined in Art. 2(5) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/399 (Schengen Borders Code).

Some European regulations deal with  ''third country national'', for instance:
*    Art. 3(1) of Directive 2008/115/EC (Return Directive)
*    Art. 2(6) of Regulation (EU) 2016/399 (Schengen Borders Code)

Depending on the used definition, people from NO, IS, LI ([[European Economic Area]]) and CH might be considered as  ''third country national''  or non ''third country national''.&lt;ref&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/content/third-country-national_en&lt;/ref&gt;

While EU nationals might have a right to cross internal borders, such right might be more limited for TCN.

[[File:Harvested grapes and barley.jpg|thumb|350px|Harvested grapes in basket and reaped barley]]
The '''tithe''' is specifically mentioned in the Books of [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]]. The tithe system was organized in a seven-year cycle, the seventh-year corresponding to the ''[[Shemittah]]''-cycle in which year tithes were broken-off, and in every third and sixth-year of this cycle the [[Second tithe]] replaced with the [[Poor tithe|Poor man's tithe]]. These tithes were in reality more like taxes for the people of Israel and were mandatory, not optional giving. This tithe was distributed locally "within thy gates" ({{sourcetext|source=Bible (King James)|book=Deuteronomy|chapter=14|verse=28}}) to support the Levites and assist the poor. Every year, ''[[First Fruits|Bikkurim]]'', ''[[Terumah]]'', ''Ma'aser Rishon'' and ''Terumat Ma'aser'' were separated from the grain, wine and oil ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:22|JP}}). Initially, the commandment to separate tithes from one's produce only applied when the entire nation of Israel had settled in the [[Land of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hil. Terumot'' 1:26)&lt;/ref&gt; The Returnees from the [[Babylonian exile]] who had resettled the country were a Jewish minority, and who, although they were not obligated to tithe their produce, put themselves under a voluntary bind to do so, and which practice became obligatory upon all.&lt;ref&gt;In accordance with [[Midrash Rabba]], ''Ruth Rabba'' 4:7, "Three things did the terrestrial [[Beit din|Court]] enact and the celestial Court agreed with them, which are these: To greet a person by employing [God's] Name, [to give juridical legitimacy to] the [[Megillat Esther|scroll of Esther]], and [to require the separation of] tithes. Tithes, from whence [did they base its legitimacy]? For Rabbi Berakhia said in the name of [Rabbi] Krispa, 'By the neglect of heave-offerings and tithes they were exiled.' Shimon bar Abba said in Rabbi Yohanan's name that since they were exiled they were exempt [from the obligation of tithing], but they, of their own volition, put themselves under the obligation, etc."&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
==Terumah (Heave-offering)==
{{main article|Terumah}}
The first obligation that was incumbent upon an Israelite or Jew was to separate from his harvested grain ([[wheat]], [[barley]], [[spelt]], etc.), wine (including unpressed grapes) and oil (including unpressed olives) the one-fiftieth portion of these products&lt;ref&gt;Mordecai Yehudah Leib Sachs and Yosef Qafih (ed), ''Perush Shishah Sidrei Mishnah'' (A Commentary on the Six Orders of the Mishnah), s.v. Tractate ''Ma'aser Rishon'', appended at the end of the book: ''The Six Orders of the Mishnah: with the Commentaries of the Rishonim'', vol. 2, pub. El ha-Meqorot: Jerusalem 1955, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; (or one-fortieth, if he were a man of generosity; and one-sixtieth if he were stingy) and to give the same to a [[Kohen]], who, in turn, would eat such fruits in a state of [[Ritual washing in Judaism|ritual cleanness]], in accordance with a biblical command, ''"...and let him not eat of the holy things, until he bathes his flesh in water. And when the sun goes down down, he will be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things because it is his food"'' ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|22:6|JP}}). This obligation was contingent upon the fact that such fruits grew in the Land of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hil. Terumot'' 1:1)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Rabbis made it an obligation to do the same for all fruits and vegetables grown in the Land of Israel, and not only to such fruits as grain, grapes and olives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hil. Terumot'' 2:6)&lt;/ref&gt; With the destruction of the Temple and the cessation of ritual purity, the obligation to separate the ''Terumah'' continued unabated, although it was no longer given to a priest of Aaron's lineage, since bodily defilement was now pervasive. The general practice after the Temple's destruction was to separate the ''Terumah'' from all fruits and vegetables by removing even the slightest portion thereof, and to immediately discard it by burial or some other means of disposal (since it can no longer be eaten in the current state of ritual uncleanness, and those doing so would make themselves liable to [[Kareth|extirpation]]).

==First tithe==
{{main article|First tithe}}
The ''first tithe'' is giving of one tenth of the remaining agricultural produce (after removing from the produce the standard ''[[Terumah]]'') to the [[Levite]] (or Aaronic [[Kohen|priests]]). Historically, during the [[First Temple]] period, the first tithe was given to the [[Levite]]s.  Approximately at the beginning of the [[Second Temple]] construction, [[Ezra]] and his [[Beth din]] implemented its giving to the kohanim.&lt;ref&gt;The Talmud [[Adin Steinsaltz]] 1992 "Yet if a priest has first tithe in his possession, he need not give it to a Levite. Ezra penalized the Levites of his generation because they did not return to Eretz Israel with him, and he decreed that first tithe should be given to ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Restoration: Old Testament, Jewish, and Christian perspectives '' p329 James M. Scott - 2001 "One says that the Levites were punished because they did not come up to the Land of Israel during Ezra's days. The other says that the first tithe was given to the priests, so that they would have food when they were in a state of ..."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Monier22.JPG|thumb|''Tithing in the Temple'' by [[Pierre Monier]]]]
The Levites, also known as the Tribe of Levi, were descendants of [[Levi]]. They were assistants to the Aaronic [[Kohen|priests]] (who were the children of [[Aaron]] and, therefore, a subset of the Tribe of Levi) and did not own or inherit a territorial [[Property|patrimony]] ({{sourcetext|source=Bible (King James)|book=Numbers|chapter=18|verse=21|range=-28}}). Their function in society was that of temple functionaries, teachers and trusted civil servants who supervised the weights and scales and witnessed agreements. The goods donated from the other Israeli tribes were their source of sustenance. They received from "all Israel" a tithe of food or livestock for support, and in turn would set aside a tenth portion of that tithe (known as the ''[[Terumat hamaaser]]'') for the Aaronic priests.

==Second tithe==
{{main article|Second tithe}}
Unlike other offerings which were restricted to consumption within the [[tabernacle]], the ''[[second tithe]]'' could be consumed anywhere within the [[Walls of Jerusalem#Pre-Israelite city|Walls of Jerusalem]]. On years one, two, four and five of the ''Shemittah''-cycle, God commanded the [[Children of Israel]] to take a second tithe that was to be brought to the place of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:23|JP}}). The owner of the produce was to separate and bring 1/10 of his finished produce to the [[Old City of Jerusalem]], after separating ''Terumah'' and the [[first tithe]], but if the family lived too far from Jerusalem, the tithe could be redeemed upon coins ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:24-25|JP}}). Then, the Bible required the owner of the redeemed coins to spend the tithe "to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine or other fermented drink, or anything you wish" ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:26|JP}}). Implicit in the commandment was an obligation to spend the coins on items meant for human consumption.

==Poor man's tithe==
{{main article|Poor tithe}}
In years three and six of the ''Shemittah''-cycle the Israelites set aside the (second) tithe instead as the ''[[poor tithe]]'', and it was given to the strangers, orphans, and widows.

==''Terumat maaser''==
{{main article|Terumat hamaaser}}
''[[Terumat hamaaser]]'' was given by the Levite to the [[Kohen]], and was one-tenth of what the Levite had received of the [[First tithe|First-tithe]]. It is alluded to in the Hebrew Bible under the words, "a tithe (tenth) of the tithe" ({{bibleverse||Numbers|18:26|JP}}). It, too, was considered ''Terumah'', and was eaten by priests in a state of ritual cleanness. Today, the ''Terumat maaser'' is discarded because of general uncleanness, just as the ''Terumah'' is now discarded.

==''Demai''==
{{main article|Demai}}
'''Demai''' ([[Mishnaic Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|דמאי}}) is a [[Halakhic]] term meaning "dubious," referring to agricultural produce, the owner of which was not trusted with regard to the correct separation of the tithes assigned to the Levites, although the ''terumah'' (the part designated unto priests) was believed to have been separated from such fruits. In such "dubious" cases, all that was necessary was to separate the [[Terumat hamaaser|one-tenth portion]] due to the priests from the [[First tithe|First Tithe]] given to the Levites, being the 1/100th part of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Mordecai Yehudah Leib Sachs (ed), ''Perush Shishah Sidrei Mishnah'' (A Commentary on the Six Orders of the Mishnah), vol. 2, appended at the end of the book: ''The Six Orders of the Mishnah: with the Commentaries of the Rishonim'', p. 3b [6], pub. ''El ha-Meqorot'': Jerusalem 1955; ''Mishnah - with Maimonides' Commentary'' (ed. [[Yosef Qafih]]), vol. 1, [[Mossad Harav Kook]]: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. ''Demai'' 1:1, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second tithe|Second Tithe]] is also removed (redeemed) from the fruit in such cases of doubt.&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with Maimonides' Commentary'' (ed. [[Yosef Qafih]]), vol. 1, [[Mossad Harav Kook]]: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. ''Demai'' 1:1, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Places that require tithing==
The criterion for determining what places require the tithing of produce is any place within the country that was held by the Returnees from the [[Babylonian exile]], as defined in the "[[Baraita of the Boundaries]]" of the Land of Israel;&lt;ref&gt;''Ha-Radbaz'' (Commentary of Rabbi David ben Zimra), on Maimonides' [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hil. Terumot'' 1:8), who cites the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], Tractate ''Shevi'it'', ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; although today the land might be held by a different entity, or else worked by non-Jews, produce grown in those places would still require the separation of tithes when they come into the hand of an Israelite or Jew.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hil. Terumot'' 1:10)&lt;/ref&gt;

Tithes are broken-off during the [[Shmita|Sabbatical year]] (such as when the ground lies fallow), during which year, all fruits, grains and vegetables that are grown of themselves in that year are considered free and ownerless property. For example, whatever lands were held by those returning from the [[Babylonian exile]] at the time of [[Ezra the Scribe|Ezra]] are forbidden to be ploughed and sown by any Jew during the Seventh year, and even if gentiles were to plough such land and sow it, the produce would be forbidden unto Jews to eat.&lt;ref&gt;Mordecai Yehudah Leib Sachs and [[Yosef Qafih]] (ed), ''Perush Shishah Sidrei Mishnah'' (A Commentary on the Six Orders of the Mishnah), s.v. Tractate ''Shevi'it'', ch. 6, appended at the end of the book: ''The Six Orders of the Mishnah: with the Commentaries of the Rishonim'', vol. 1, pub. El ha-Meqorot: Jerusalem 1955, p. 49 [25]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the extension of such lands held by the people of Israel who departed Egypt and who entered the [[Land of Canaan]] under their leader, [[Joshua]], are forbidden to be ploughed by any Jew during the Seventh year, but if gentiles had ploughed such land and sown it, the produce is permitted to be eaten by a Jew. If on a regular week-year, fruits and grains and vegetables, if grown by an Israelite in these places, would require tithing.&lt;ref&gt;Mordecai Yehudah Leib Sachs and [[Yosef Qafih]] (ed), ''Perush Shishah Sidrei Mishnah'' (A Commentary on the Six Orders of the Mishnah), s.v. Tractate ''Shevi'it'', ch. 6, appended at the end of the book: ''The Six Orders of the Mishnah: with the Commentaries of the Rishonim'', vol. 1, pub. El ha-Meqorot: Jerusalem 1955, p. 49 [25]; [[Maimonides]], [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hil. Terumot'' 1:7)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cattle tithe==
{{main article|Cattle tithe}}
An additional tithe mentioned in the Book of Leviticus ({{bibleverse-nb||Lv|27:32-33|HE}}) is the [[cattle tithe]], which is to be sacrificed as a ''[[korban]]'' at the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].

==''Ma'aser kesafim''==
''Ma'aser kesafim'' is a tithe that Jews give to charity ([[Tzedakah#Ma'aser kesafim|tzedakah]]), something that is done on a voluntary basis, as this practice has not been regulated in Jewish codes of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dafdigest.org/shekalim/Shekalim%20006.pdf |title=Tzedaka and Maaser Kesafim |date=May 23, 2006 |website=dafdigest.org |publisher=Chicago Center for Torah and Chesed |at=Number 449 |access-date=February 3, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526055244/http://www.dafdigest.org/shekalim/Shekalim%20006.pdf |archive-date=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Truce of Leulinghem''' was a truce agreed to by [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]'s [[kingdom of England]] and its allies, and [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]]'s [[kingdom of France]] and its allies, on 18 July 1389, ending the second phase of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. England was on the edge of financial collapse and suffering from internal political divisions. On the other side, Charles VI was suffering from a mental illness that handicapped the furthering of the war by the French government. Neither side was willing to concede on the primary cause of the war, the legal status of the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] and the King of England's homage to the King of France through his possession of the duchy. However, both sides faced major internal issues that could badly damage their kingdoms if the war continued. The truce was originally negotiated by representatives of the kings to last three years, but the two kings met in person at [[Leulinghem]], near the English fortress of [[Calais]], and agreed to extend the truce to a twenty-seven years' period. Other provisions were agreed to, in attempts to bring an end to the [[papal schism]], to launch a joint crusade against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turk]]s in the [[Balkans]], to seal the marriage of Richard to Charles' daughter Isabella along with an 800,000 franc [[dowry]], and to guarantee to continue peace negotiations, in order to establish a lasting treaty between the kingdoms. The treaty brought peace to the [[Iberian peninsula]], where [[Portugal]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] were supporting the English and French respectively. The English evacuated all their holdings in northern France except [[Calais]].

The truce was the result of a decade of failed peace negotiations and inaugurated a thirteen years peace, the longest period of sustained peace during the Hundred Years' War. During the years following the truce, Richard reneged on his agreement to assist in ending the schism, leading the French to unilaterally withdraw from the obedience of either pope and seize [[Avignon]] by military force. French foreign policy also began to focus on [[Italy]], and [[Genoa]] became a French protectorate. In England, Richard used the lapse in fighting to attack his political enemies and confiscate their lands, which he redistributed as rewards to his supporters. He then left for [[Ireland]] to put down a revolt among the Irish chieftains, but during his absence a number of his exiled opponents returned, led by his cousin [[Henry of Bolingbroke]], [[Duke of Lancaster]]. Henry began an insurrection and seized most of England before Richard could return. Upon his return, Richard was imprisoned, and before he was starved to death he was forced to agree to abdicate. Henry was crowned in his place. The French initially interpreted events in England as a repudiation of the truce and raised an army and put garrisons in place on the fronts. Henry IV reaffirmed the truce which remained in place for several more years.

Henry made a number of aggressive political moves against France in the following years, marrying [[Joan of Navarre, Queen of England|Joanna, widow of the duke of Brittany]] in April 1402, and forming alliances with several German rulers, including a marriage alliance with [[Bavaria]]. Scotland was the first nation to break the truce, invading England in August 1402 in coordination with a revolt in [[Wales]]. The French reentered the conflict in September 1403, landing an army in Wales.

==Background==
In 1369 the French government repudiated the 1360 [[Treaty of Brétigny]], resuming the [[Hundred Years' War]] between the [[kingdom of France]] and the [[kingdom of England]] and their various allies. The war originated over the King of England's status as both a French duke and also an English king, creating conflicting interests in many of his actions. The French had declared the English duchy in southwestern France forfeit, beginning the war. The English won the first phase, and the treaty granted the English possession of the duchy as a fief independent of France. During the ensuing decade of peace, the French government strengthened and determined to establish control over the duchy. For nearly two decades, the French pursued a military policy of avoiding direct battle with the English armies and wearing them down by [[Attrition warfare|attrition]]. Although the English won a few victories, eventually almost all of their gains from the earlier phases of the war were lost, including all of the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] except for a narrow coastal strip from [[Bordeaux]] to the border of [[Navarre]].&lt;ref name = s774&gt;Sumption, p. 774&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1389 England was in the midst of political divisions. King Richard II, favoured making peace because the English parliament refused to grant sufficient funds to prosecute the war, the population had twice risen in revolt of the high taxation, and the nobility, led by his uncle the [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]], was attempting to subvert his control over the kingdom. France was also suffering from internal crisis. Charles VI was having recurring attacks of mental illness that paralyzed the government. During the 1380s a series of revolts occurred in the kingdom as a result of high taxation, beginning with the [[Harelle]] in 1383. As a result of these difficulties, the two kingdoms had been making attempts to negotiate a peace throughout the decade.&lt;ref name = s774/&gt;

==Negotiations==
[[File:Richard II King of England.jpg|thumb|alt=A young man wearing a crown, wearing flowing red robes, and holding a scepter and cross|[[Richard II of England]], ''ca'' 1390]]

In June 1389, high-level diplomats finished negotiations on a formal peace treaty in the town of [[Leulinghem]], a town just outside [[Calais]]. England and its allies, [[Portugal]], [[Ghent]] and the [[Duchy of Guelders]], had been represented in the negotiations by [[John of Gaunt]], [[Duke of Lancaster]], and [[Thomas of Woodstock]], [[Duke of Gloucester]], the uncles of Richard II. France and its allies, the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], were represented by [[Philip the Bold]], Duke of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], and [[John of Valois]], [[Duke of Berry]], the uncles of Charles VI.&lt;ref&gt;Sumption, p. 805&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kingdom of Aragon]], several counties of the low countries, and the [[Duchy of Brittany]] had already made peace and became neutral in the conflict. The [[Holy Roman Empire]] nominally supported the English position but had remained neutral in the conflict.  Lower level diplomats had been working out many of the details of the treaty in the years prior. France, overestimating England's ability to continue prosecuting the war, made major concessions, offering to return all the Duchy of Aquitaine to the English, except for the [[County of Poitou]], permitting the English to maintain their fortress at [[Calais]], and offering an indemnity of 1.5 million francs for English losses. In exchange, the King of England had to agree to do [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to the King of France in exchange for his duchy. The treaty would essentially restore to England everything lost in the course of the war except the full sovereignty of Aquitaine. Both delegations returned to their respective governments to have the treaty approved. In the interim, a three-year truce was agreed to go into effect on 18 July.&lt;ref&gt;Sumption, p. 807&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles VI le Fou.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles VI of France]]]]

The French government was in effect led by the Duke of Burgundy since Charles VI's incapacity, and French approval was quickly granted. In England, Richard's political position was weak and the [[House of Commons of England]] in Parliament was controlled largely by the knights fighting the war.&lt;ref&gt;Sumption, p. 813&lt;/ref&gt; Richard feared open rebellion if he agreed to the treaty without the approval of Parliament, and called a session to consider the treaty. Parliament rejected the treaty, citing their fear of placing the king as a [[Homage (feudal)|liege]] of the king of France and suggesting it would effectively make England a client kingdom of France. The Parliament also refused to grant a significant tax grant to continue funding the stalled war.&lt;ref&gt;Sumption, p. 814&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard decided to enact a ''de facto'' peace with the French and use the interim to punish his political enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Sumption, p. 818&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 May 1395 he received a French embassy to negotiate with him personally. It was agreed that he would marry the six-year-old daughter of Charles, Isabelle, and Charles would provide a dowry of 800,000 francs and extend the truce by five years. In exchange Richard began evacuating the ports he controlled in northern France, surrendering them all except Calais. [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[Cherbourg]] were only evacuated after substantial payments by the local nobility were made in exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Sumption, p. 823&lt;/ref&gt; The two kings agreed to meet in future and finalize negotiations. Charles, however, remained in a fragile mental state and was frequently unaware of his surroundings. He made a temporary recovery in 1396, and the two kings met privately at Leulinghem over the course of two days and made a number of commitments. They agreed to a joint [[crusade]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] in the [[Balkans]], Richard agreed to support French attempts to end the [[papal schism]] and formally accepted Isabelle as his wife and received his dowry. The truce was extended by another nineteen years, and both men agreed to continue negotiations towards a permanent peace. With negotiations complete, both kings returned to their respective capitals and the truce remained in effect.&lt;ref&gt;Sumption, p. 831&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In the aftermath of the treaty, Richard began executing revenge against his political enemies. Several men with large landed estates were dispossessed and executed or exiled. Their property was assigned to allies of Richard, who was attempting to create a block of allies in central England. Richard failed to send support for the crusade against the Turks; the French contingent, which contained many of France's prominent fighters, was annihilated at the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] in September 1396. Some of Richard's advisers suggested reopening the war, but he rejected the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Sumption, p. 834&lt;/ref&gt; Richard also repudiated his agreement to end the papal schism and continued to support the Roman pope over the Avignon pope. This led the French to unilaterally withdraw support for either pope and to seize [[Avignon]] by force.&lt;ref name="Sumption, p. 836"&gt;Sumption, p. 836&lt;/ref&gt; Richard's attacks against the landed nobility were met with hostility which remained suppressed for a time. After the death of John of Gaunt in 1399, Richard seized his duchy from his exiled son, [[Henry of Bolingbroke]]. Bolingbroke had taken up residence in Paris, where many of his fellow exiles began plotting a return to England.&lt;ref&gt;Sumption, p. 841&lt;/ref&gt; Richard left England to suppress a revolt in [[Ireland]] during 1399 and while he was away Henry led a small army back to England and seized his former estate by force. He quickly raised an army among the rest of the disaffected nobility and took control of most of England without force before Richard could return. Upon his return, Richard was forced to abdicate and was then starved to death. Henry was crowned King.&lt;ref&gt;Sumption, p. 862&lt;/ref&gt;

French foreign policy shifted in the years following the truce, and the focus was placed on [[Italy]] as the French attempted to gain a foothold whereby they could force the Roman pope to abdicate. [[Genoa]] became a French protectorate. Charles's mental state continued to deteriorate, leading to more fighting in the court, with his wife allying with his uncles in opposition of Charles's brother, [[Louis I, Duke of Orléans|Louis of Orleans]], Duke of Touraine.&lt;ref name="Sumption, p. 836"/&gt; When Henry took the throne in England, the French initially interpreted it as a repudiation of the truce and raised an army and strengthened their garrisons on their borders. An embassy to England reconfirmed the truce with Henry.&lt;ref&gt;Sumption, p. 863&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repudiation==
Henry made a number of aggressive political moves toward France in the following years, marrying the dowager duchess of Brittany, [[Joan of Navarre, Queen of England|Joan of Navarre]] in April 1402, making him duke of the two largest duchies with ties to France. The French responded by making one of Charles' sons [[Duke of Guyenne]], a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine which the French claimed was forfeit. Henry formed alliances with several German states, including a marriage alliance with [[Bavaria]]. Scotland was the first nation to break the truce, invading England in August 1402 in coordination with a revolt in [[Wales]]. The Welsh revolt was likely influenced by the French. The French reentered the conflict in September 1403, landing an army in Wales. The thirteen-year truce was the longest period of peace between England and France in the Hundred Years' War. The war continued intermittently for another five decades.

[[File:White certificates diagram.gif|thumb|right|When determining the extent of energy saving, the energy use is compared against a baseline, which is an estimate of the energy use in the absence of any attempt at saving energy.]]
In [[environmental policy]], '''white certificates''' are documents certifying that a certain reduction of [[World energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]] has been attained. In most applications, the white certificates are tradable and combined with an obligation to achieve a certain target of energy savings. Under such a system, producers, suppliers or distributors of electricity, gas and oil are required to undertake [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] measures for the final user that are consistent with a pre-defined percentage of their annual energy deliverance. If energy producers do not meet the mandated target for energy consumption they are required to pay a penalty.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/demand/legislation/doc/neeap/france_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023132313/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/demand/legislation/doc/neeap/france_en.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The white certificates are given to the producers whenever an amount of energy is saved whereupon the producer can use the certificate for their own target compliance or can be sold to (other) parties who cannot meet their targets.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu" /&gt; Quite analogous to the closely related concept of [[emissions trading]], the tradability in theory guarantees that the overall energy saving is achieved at least cost, while the certificates guarantee that the overall energy saving target is achieved.

A white certificate, also referred to as an ''Energy Savings Certificate (ESC), Energy Efficiency Credit (EEC)'', or ''white tag'', is an instrument issued by an authorized body guaranteeing that a specified amount of energy savings has been achieved. Each certificate is a unique and traceable commodity carrying a property right over a certain amount of additional energy savings and guaranteeing that the benefit of these savings has not been accounted for elsewhere.

== Practical applications ==

===Europe===
In Europe several countries have implemented a white certificate scheme or are
seriously considering doing so. Italy started a scheme in January 2005; France and Denmark a year later. Great Britain has combined its obligation system for energy savings with the possibility to trade obligations and savings. The Netherlands and Poland are seriously considering the introduction of a white certificate scheme in the near future.

In the UK, the [[Carbon Emission Reduction Target|Energy Efficiency Commitment]] (2002–2005) program required that all electricity and gas suppliers with 15,000 or more domestic customers must achieve a combined energy saving of 62 [[TWh]] by 2005 by assisting their customers to take energy-efficiency measures in their homes: suppliers must achieve at least half of their energy savings in households on income-related benefits and tax credits. In the second (2005–2008) EEC 2, energy saving targets were raised to 130 TWh suppliers, and here suppliers with at least 50,000 domestic customers (including affiliated licenses) are eligible for an obligation. The third phase runs from April 2008 to December 2012 and is intended to deliver 185{{nbsp}}Mt{{nnbsp}}{{CO2}} lifetime savings by 2012.

===United States===
[[Connecticut]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Nevada]] have adopted Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standards that require regulated utilities to meet a certain percentage of their projected power needs through energy efficiency. Utilities must meet their obligations by either reducing their consumers’ energy usage, or by purchasing energy efficiency certificates (white certificates). More states are expected to follow in the near future.

There is also a voluntary market where large corporations are purchasing energy efficiency certificates as a way of meeting their corporate commitments to reduce their [[carbon footprint]]s. Sterling Planet, a market maker in renewable energy certificates (RECs) is also making a market for voluntary purchases of White Tags. Sterling Planet helped develop Connecticut's Energy Efficiency Standard and is presently the only company actively involved in this space.

The white certificate concept is an offshoot of the more mature renewable energy credit or "[[Renewable Energy Certificate (United States)|green tag]]" trading. The market for white certificates is expected to grow larger than the green tag market because it requires less government approval and expense to install energy efficiency measures in factories and commercial buildings than to construct most renewable energy projects.

One issue arising is how to avoid allowing customers to "double dip" in white tag and other incentive programs for energy efficiency, such as ISO New England’s forward capacity market and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative3.

'''Bill CS/SB 318''' is an amendment passed by the [[Florida Legislature|State of Florida]] in June 2010 which amends several sections of Chapter 379 of the [[Florida Statutes]] (F.S.).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=4238] {{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sections 379.231, 379.372, 379.374, 379.3761, 379.401, and 379.4015 deal with wildlife regulations and were amended by this bill.&lt;ref name="state1"&gt;[http://www.dep.state.fl.us/cmp/federal/files/2010/379ana10.pdf ]{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly, this bill seeks to regulate entities which own, import, sell and/or breed certain prohibited species of [[reptile]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=_s0318er.DOCX&amp;DocumentType=Bill&amp;BillNumber=0318&amp;Session=2010|title=SIB 318 &amp; SB 572 |publisher=Myfloridahouse.gov |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically this bill prohibits the ownership of a variety of commonly kept [[Pythonidae|pythons]] and [[Monitor lizard|monitor]] species. Additionally, the bill provided rules for a commission to add species of reptiles to the prohibited list.&lt;!-- please verify if the copy edit is factually correct--&gt;

==Amendments to existing Florida law==
Amendment to section 379.231 and 379.3762 changes the language throughout to bring continuity to the legal text.

Amended section 379.372 specifies a list of prohibited species which may not be possessed, imported into the state, sold, bartered, traded, or bred without the authorization of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission ([[Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission|FWC]]). Prohibited animals include "Burmese or Indian python (''[[Python molurus]]''), reticulated python (''[[Python reticulatus]]''), Northern African python (''[[Python sebae]]''), Southern African python (''[[Python natalensis]]''), amethystine or scrub python (''[[Morelia amethistina]]''), green anaconda (''[[Eunectes murinus]]''), Nile monitor (''[[Varanus niloticus]]''), and any other reptile designated as a conditional or prohibited species by the FWC.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

According to the&lt;ref name="state1"/&gt;  Amended section 379.3761, F.S. prohibits the sale of any wild animal which is designated as a prohibited or conditional species, reptile of concern, or venomous reptiles in the State of Florida, regardless of the origin of the sale or location of the initial transaction.

Amended section 379.4015, F.S. is the penalty section of the amended statute. So called "conditional" or "Prohibited" reptile violations are a level two violation with a mandatory minimum fine of $100, and a requirement that the animal must be surrendered to the FWC unless a permit to possess is applied for and approved.

These amendments were made to Florida law to address concerns regarding the introduction of reptile species which seem capable of not only adapting to the local environment, but in fact seem to thrive. Florida Fish and Wildlife has found breeding colonies of Burmese pythons, a large Asian constrictor routinely sold through the United States as a pet, in the [[Everglades National Park]].

==Permit to possess prohibited species==
The state of Florida does allow for possession of species otherwise prohibited by law for the purposes of research. There is no fee for this permit. A research plan, security plan must be submitted to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) in order to attain approval. Aquariums, zoological parks and public exhibitors may also acquire a permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfwc.com/license/wildlife/nonnative-species/ |title=Nonnative Permit |publisher=Myfwc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prohibited Species possessed prior to the enactment of SB 318==
Individuals in possession of any conditional species prior to July 1, 2010 are allowed to retain ownership of their animals provided they maintain a valid reptile of concern license for the remainder of its life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfwc.com/license/wildlife/captive-wildlife/reptiles-of-concern |accessdate=December 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105221706/http://www.myfwc.com/license/wildlife/captive-wildlife/reptiles-of-concern/ |archivedate=November 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-native invasive species in Florida==
Burmese pythons are an invasive species in parts of Florida. It has been found that the climate of the Everglades enables the species to thrive .&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/UW/UW28600.pdf |format=PDF |title=Burmeses Pythons in South Florida : Scientific Support for Invasive Species Management |publisher=Edis.ifas.ufl.edu |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This species is also known to be breeding in parts of Florida along with the common Boa Constrictor{{citation needed|reason=Needs reliable source; Fish and Wildlife do not claim common boa constrictors are breeding.|date=May 2016}}. Conservationist and wildlife officials are concerned about this natural predator spreading to areas which are biologically vulnerable, the Florida Keys for example.

As a predator the Burmese python is a threat to the preservation of native wildlife. This pythons territorial expanse and adaptability to a variety of habitats, flexible dietary requirements and lifespan This species of python along is an excellent swimmer and has been shown to prey on the endangered .&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; after a dietary analysis was performed on a specimen. They have been shown to eat a diversity of pretty to include rabbits, rats, squirrel, domestic cats, bobcats, a variety of bird species and the American alligator. The Burmese pythons flexible diet makes it a competitor for the States endangered Indigo snake.

Currently both Federal and State agencies are attempting to develop methods of containing and eradicating this and other invasive species. Due to the cost of controlling exotic species once introduced, preventing introduction of non-native species is of import.  Legal measures such as Bill CS/SB 318&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; as passed by the [[Florida Legislature|State of Florida]] in June 2010 are initial attempts to mitigate the release of exotic species, such as the Burmese python and other reptiles.

==US Geological Survey and the threat of invasive species spreading==
According to the [[US Geological Survey]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1875 |title=USGS Release: USGS Maps Show Potential Non-Native Python Habitat Along Three U.S. Coasts (2/20/2008 10:45:00 AM) |publisher=Usgs.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burmese pythons, already established in parts of Florida are adaptable to temperature conditions in a significant portion of the United States. Current estimates show that almost one-third of the continental US would provide appropriate temperatures, shelter and prey which would facilitate the adaption of this python species.

Maps&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; released by the USGS show that current environmental temperatures which match the Burmese pythons native environment include significant portions of the southeast, Texas and lower southwest. based on global warming models the USGS predicts that the suitable habitat for the Burmese pythons will expand greatly during the remaining portion of the century.

==Opponents of the Bill==
The classification of the Burmese python as a subspecies of the Indian Python is not scientifically accepted anymore. Recent publications to include the "Zur taxonomie des dunklen tigerpythons, Python molurus bivittatus Kuhl, 1820, speziell der population von Sulawesi" in 2009 by Hans Jacobs ''et al.'' has established that the Burmese python is not a subspecies of the Indian Python. This is in addition to the 1999 report "The Burmese Python is a questionable subspecies of the Indian Python, Python molurus" which was coauthored by Dr. Rodda. To further this belief herpetologist will point to the fact that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service does not consider the Indian Python to be the same species as the Burmese Python. The Indian pythons is already banned from import or export with the interstate transportation of such animals being limited to those who possess a specific permit.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1875 |title=USGS Release: USGS Maps Show Potential Non-Native Python Habitat Along Three U.S. Coasts (2/20/2008 10:45:00 AM) |publisher=Usgs.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reptile industry is responsible for the employment of thousands of individuals and has an economic net worth of approximately $3 billion each year,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; measures such as SB318 harm the industry as a whole. Opponents to the legislation passed by the State of Florida are critical of the measures taken for a variety of reasons. The United States Geological Survey which produced the maps and report detailing the possible expansion of Burmese pythons in as many as 32 States was written by Dr. Gordon Rodda. Dr. Rodda was the co-author of a paper in 1999 titled "The Burmese Python is a questionable subspecies of the Indian Python, Python molurus". This is significant to opponents who wonder why the paper Dr. Rodda coauthored for the USGS, "What Parts of the U.S. Mainland Are Climatically Suitable for Invasive Alien Pythons Spreading from Everglades National Park?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fort.usgs.gov/Products/Publications/21972/21972.pdf |accessdate=December 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814111851/http://www.fort.usgs.gov/Products/Publications/21972/21972.pdf |archivedate=August 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; used climatic data for the Indian Python to support his work, which is an endangered species highly regulated by the Federal Government, in place of the Burmese python which the report was written on.

Further work which is critical of the USGS report on the expansion of the Burmese python was written by Dr, Frank Burbrink with the City University of New York which used more than annual rainfall and temperature to determine habitat suitable for the large constrictors. 19 variables were taken into consideration.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080812213816.htm |title=Burmese Pythons Will Find Little Suitable Habitat Outside South Florida, Study Suggests |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002931 |publisher=ScienceDaily |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of climatic data from the localities where the Burmese python is naturally found climatic models where generated to help predict where this species could inhabit. As a result, "the models suggest that the pythons are restricted to the vicinity of the Everglades in extreme south Florida…".&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

The models by Dr. Burbrink predict different results than the models of Dr. Rodda because variables such as climatic extremes and seasonal variation create a significant variation in the animals survivability. Dr. Burbrink's models also predict that global warming will actually reduce the habitat suitable for exotic southeastern Asian species such as the Burmese Python.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Herpetologist perspective on the presence of Pythons in Florida==
[[Herpetologist]] Shawn Heflick has a permit from the State of Florida to hunt Burmese Pythons in the Everglades.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/invasion-of-the-giant-pythons/herpetologist-shawn-heflick-answers-your-questions/5564/ |title=Invasion of the Giant Pythons ~ Herpetologist Shawn Heflick Answers Your Questions &amp;#124; Nature |publisher=PBS |date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also the president of the [[Central Florida Herpetological Society]]. Of note he indicates in an interview that there "is very little genetic variation with this wild population…" and goes on to say that a "genetic study done on this population suggest that the population stems from the [[Hurricane Andrew]] devastation in 1992." The hurricane is an important event as a reptile breeding facility had an estimated nine hundred animals released due to its destruction by the Hurricane in 1992. The location of this facility is thought to be the "epicenter" of the current Burmese Python population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  Mr. Heflick also goes on to add that the record cold weather in parts of Florida has led to a "large number" of deaths in the local Burmese Python population.

==Technology==
Currently Federal and State officials are using technology in the hunt for these invasive species. In addition to legislation to restrict the flow of potentially invasive species into Florida there are extensive efforts to eradicate the current population of Burmese pythons in the Everglades. Current Florida legislation requires that all "species of concern" or "prohibited species" must be implanted with a [[microchip implant (animal)|microchip]] to aid in their tracking should they escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080520131750.htm |title=Invasion Of Gigantic Burmese Pythons In South Florida Appears To Be Rapidly Expanding |publisher=ScienceDaily |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researches with the [[University of Florida]] are taking this one step further and implanting a radio transmitter into snakes and releasing them back into the wild. These so-called "Judas snakes" lead the researchers to areas inhabited by the Burmese python and allow trackers to catch and euthanize the invasive animals.  During the first trial, with the release of three, radio transmitter implanted pythons, twelve untagged snakes were caught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://news.ufl.edu/2006/06/01/pythons/|title=06 » 'Judas Snakes' help researchers remove pythons from the Everglades » University of Florida|publisher=News.ufl.edu|date=|accessdate=2015-02-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184059/http://news.ufl.edu/2006/06/01/pythons/#|archive-date=2013-10-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Day For Animals In Laboratories (WDAIL)''' (also known as World Lab Animal Day)&lt;ref name="Navs history"&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of the NAVS|url=http://www.navs.org.uk/about_us/24/0/299/|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is observed every year on 24 April. The surrounding week has come to be known as "World Week for Animals In Laboratories".&lt;ref name=WWAIL&gt;{{cite web|title=World Week for Animals in Laboratories|url=http://www.wwail.org/|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]] (NAVS) describe the day as an "international day of commemoration"&lt;ref name="Navs history"/&gt; for [[Animal testing|animals in laboratories]].

==History==
World Day For Animals In Laboratories was established in 1979 by the British [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]] (NAVS).&lt;ref name="Navs history" /&gt; The date 24 April was chosen as it marked the birthday of former NAVS president [[Hugh Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding]].

Today the event is marked by demonstrations and protests by groups opposed to the use of animals in research.&lt;ref name="WLALW"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Laboratory Animal Liberation Week|url=http://www.all-creatures.org/wlalw/|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010 protesters marched through central [[London]] calling for an end to the use of animals in research,.&lt;ref name=London2010&gt;{{cite web|title=World Day For Animals In Laboratories|url=http://www.demotix.com/news/314089/world-day-animals-laboratories#media-314063/|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar march took place in [[Birmingham]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="Brum2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Day for Animals in Laboratories rally, Birmingham|url=http://allevents.in/Birmingham/World-Day-for-Animals-in-Laboratories-Press-Release/292643717480156#/|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nottingham]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veggies.org.uk/eventprint.php?ref=324 2014 Nottingham Rally Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

World Day and World Week For Animals In Laboratories have also attracted attention from scientific groups defending the use of animals in research. On 22 April 2009 members of [[Speaking of Research#UCLA Pro-Test|UCLA Pro-Test]] held a rally in support of biomedical research on animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stand up for Research at UCLA – April 22nd !!|url=http://speakingofresearch.com/2009/03/30/stand-up-for-research-at-ucla-april-22nd/|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to condemn the violence and harassment directed at faculty member Prof. David Jentsch by animal activists.&lt;ref name="ProTest"&gt;{{cite web|title=West Side Story: Scientists vs. Activists|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/West-Side-Story-Scientists-Activists-Face-Off-at-UCLA.html|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists, supporters rally at UCLA for animal research|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/23/local/me-animals23|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NAVS and other groups opposed to animal research have claimed that World Day For Animals In Laboratories is recognised by the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="Navs history" /&gt;&lt;ref name=AA&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Aid: World Day For Animals In Laboratories|url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/NEWS/news_experiments/ALL/2679/|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PTHuffPost&gt;{{cite web|last=Peter G.|first=Tatchell|title=Medical Charities Are Funding Animal Experiments But They Don't Want You to Know|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/peter-g-tatchell/peter-tatchell-medical-charities-funding-animal-experiments_b_1446254.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the day is not included on the official list of United Nations observances.&lt;ref name="Un observances"&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Observances: International Days|url=https://www.un.org/en/events/observances/days.shtml|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
