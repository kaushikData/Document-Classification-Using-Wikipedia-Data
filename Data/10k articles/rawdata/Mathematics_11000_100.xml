      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12227">'''Affine differential geometry''', is a type of [[differential geometry]] in which the differential invariants are invariant under volume-preserving [[affine transformation]]s.  The name ''affine differential geometry'' follows from [[Felix Klein|Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]]. The basic difference between affine and [[Riemannian geometry|Riemannian]] differential geometry is that in the affine case we introduce [[volume form]]s over a manifold instead of [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]]s.

==Preliminaries==
Here we consider the simplest case, i.e. [[manifold]]s of [[codimension]] one. Let {{nowrap|1=''M'' &amp;sub; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} be an ''n''-dimensional manifold, and let ξ be a vector field on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} [[Transversality (mathematics)|transverse]] to {{math|''M''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''T&lt;sub&gt;p''&lt;/sub&gt;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;M'' &amp;oplus; Span(&amp;xi;)}} for all {{nowrap|1=''p'' &amp;isin; ''M'',}} where ⊕ denotes the [[direct sum of vector spaces|direct sum]] and Span the [[linear span]].

For a smooth manifold, say ''N'', let Ψ(''N'') denote the [[module (mathematics)|module]] of smooth [[vector fields]] over ''N''. Let {{nowrap|1=''D'' : &amp;Psi;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;thinsp;&amp;times;&amp;thinsp;&amp;Psi;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;rarr; &amp;Psi;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} be the standard [[covariant derivative]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; where {{nowrap|1=''D''(''X'', ''Y'') = ''D&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Y''.}}
We can decompose ''D&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Y'' into a component [[Tangent space|tangent]] to ''M'' and a transverse component, [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to ξ. This gives the equation of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]: {{nowrap|1=''D&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Y'' = &amp;nabla;&lt;sub&gt;''X&lt;/sub&gt;Y'' + ''h''(''X'',''Y'')&amp;xi;,}} where {{nowrap|1=&amp;nabla; : &amp;Psi;(''M'')&amp;thinsp;&amp;times;&amp;thinsp;&amp;Psi;(''M'') &amp;rarr; &amp;Psi;(''M'')}} is the induced [[Connection (mathematics)|connexion]] on ''M'' and {{nowrap|1=''h'' : &amp;Psi;(''M'')&amp;thinsp;&amp;times;&amp;thinsp;&amp;Psi;(''M'') &amp;rarr; '''R'''}} is a [[bilinear form]]. Notice that ∇ and ''h'' depend upon the choice of transverse vector field ξ. We consider only those [[hypersurface]]s for which ''h'' is [[non-degenerate]]. This is a property of the hypersurface ''M'' and does not depend upon the choice of transverse vector field ξ.&lt;ref name="Nomizu"&gt;{{Citation|first=K.|last=Nomizu|first2=T.|last2=Sasaki|title=Affine Differential Geometry: Geometry of Affine Immersions |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=0-521-44177-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''h'' is non-degenerate then we say that ''M'' is non-degenerate. In the case of curves in the plane, the non-degenerate curves are those without [[Inflection point|inflexion]]s. In the case of surfaces in 3-space, the non-degenerate surfaces are those without [[Parabolic point#Classification of points on a surface|parabolic point]]s.

We may also consider the derivative of ξ in some tangent direction, say ''X''. This quantity, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;ξ, can be decomposed into a component tangent to ''M'' and a transverse component, parallel to ξ. This gives the [[Julius Weingarten|Weingarten]] equation: {{nowrap|1=''D&lt;sub&gt;X''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;xi; = &amp;minus;''SX'' + &amp;tau;(''X'')&amp;xi;.}} The type-(1,1)-[[tensor]] {{nowrap|1=''S'' : &amp;Psi;(''M'') &amp;rarr; &amp;Psi;(''M'')}} is called the affine shape operator, the [[differential form|differential one-form]] {{nowrap|1=&amp;tau; : &amp;Psi;(''M'') &amp;rarr; '''R'''}} is called the transverse connexion form. Again, both ''S'' and τ depend upon the choice of transverse vector field ξ.

==The first Induced volume form==

Let {{nowrap|1=&amp;Omega; : &amp;Psi;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''}} be a [[volume form]] defined on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;. We can induce a volume form on ''M'' given by {{nowrap|1=&amp;omega; : &amp;Psi;(''M'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''}} given by {{nowrap|1=&amp;omega;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) := &amp;Omega;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;xi;).}} This is a natural definition: in [[differential geometry|Euclidean differential geometry]] where ξ is the [[surface normal|Euclidean unit normal]] then the standard Euclidean volume spanned by ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is always equal to ω(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). Notice that ω depends on the choice of transverse vector field ξ.

==The second induced volume form==

For tangent vectors ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; let {{nowrap|1=''H'' := (''h''&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be the {{nowrap|1=''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]}} given by {{nowrap|1=''h''&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt; := ''h''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,''X''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;).}} We define a second volume form on ''M'' given by {{nowrap|1=&amp;nu; : &amp;Psi;(''M'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R''',}} where {{nowrap|1=&amp;nu;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) := {{!}}det(H){{!}}&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt;.}} Again, this is a natural definition to make. If ''M'' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''h'' is the Euclidean [[scalar product]] then ν(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is always the standard Euclidean volume spanned by the vectors ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
Since ''h'' depends on the choice of transverse vector field ξ it follows that ν does too.

==Two natural conditions==

We impose two natural conditions. The first is that the induced connexion ∇ and the induced volume form ω be compatible, i.e. ∇ω ≡ 0. This means that {{nowrap|1=&amp;nabla;&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;omega; = 0}} for all {{nowrap|1=''X'' &amp;isin; &amp;Psi;(''M'').}} In other words, if we [[parallel transport]] the vectors ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; along some curve in ''M'', with respect to the connexion ∇, then the volume spanned by ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, with respect to the volume form ω, does not change. A direct calculation&lt;ref name="Nomizu" /&gt; shows that {{nowrap|1=&amp;nabla;&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;omega; = &amp;tau;(''X'')&amp;omega;}} and so {{nowrap|1=&amp;nabla;&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;omega; = 0}} for all {{nowrap|1=''X'' &amp;isin; &amp;Psi;(''M'')}} if, and only if, τ ≡ 0, i.e. {{nowrap|1=''D''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;xi; &amp;isin; &amp;Psi;(''M'')}} for all {{nowrap|1=''X'' &amp;isin; &amp;Psi;(''M'').}} This means that the derivative of ξ, in a tangent direction ''X'', with respect to ''D'' always yields a, possibly zero, tangent vector to ''M''. The second condition is that the two volume forms ω and ν coincide, i.e. {{nowrap|1=&amp;omega; ≡ &amp;nu;.}}

==The conclusion==

It can be shown&lt;ref name="Nomizu" /&gt; that there is, up to sign, a unique choice of transverse vector field ξ for which the two conditions that {{nowrap|1=&amp;nabla;&amp;omega; ≡ 0}} and {{nowrap|1=&amp;omega; ≡ &amp;nu;}} are both satisfied. These two special transverse vector fields are called affine normal vector fields, or sometimes called [[Wilhelm Blaschke|Blaschke]] normal fields.&lt;ref name="Su"&gt;{{Citation |first=Buchin |last=Su |authorlink=Su Buqing |title=Affine Differential Geometry|publisher=Harwood Academic|year=1983|isbn=0-677-31060-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its dependence on volume forms for its definition we see that the affine normal vector field is invariant under volume preserving [[affine transformation]]s. These transformations are given by {{nowrap|1=SL(''n''+1,'''R''') ⋉ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;,}} where SL(''n''+1,'''R''') denotes the [[special linear group]] of {{nowrap|1=(''n''+1) × (''n''+1)}} matrices with real entries and determinant 1, and ⋉ denotes the [[semi-direct product]].  {{nowrap|1=SL(''n''+1,'''R''') ⋉ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}} forms a [[Lie group]].

==The affine normal line==

The '''affine normal line''' at a point {{nowrap|1=''p'' &amp;isin; ''M''}} is the line passing through ''p'' and parallel to ξ.

===Plane curves===

[[Image:AffineNormDrDec.jpeg|thumbnail|Affine normal line for the curve {{nowrap|1=&amp;gamma;(''t'') = (''t'' + 2''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} at {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 0.}}]]
The affine normal vector field for a curve in the plane has a nice geometrical interpretation.&lt;ref name="Su"/&gt; Let {{nowrap|1=''I'' &amp;sub; '''R'''}} be an [[open interval]] and let {{nowrap|1=&amp;gamma; : ''I'' &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} be a [[smooth function|smooth]] parametrisation of a plane curve. We assume that γ(''I'') is a non-degenerate curve (in the sense of Nomizu and Sasaki&lt;ref name="Nomizu"/&gt;), i.e. is without [[inflexion point]]s. Consider a point {{nowrap|1=''p'' = &amp;gamma;(''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} on the plane curve. Since γ(''I'') is without inflexion points it follows that γ(''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is not an inflexion point and so the curve will be locally convex,&lt;ref name="CAS"&gt;{{Citation|first=J. W.|last=Bruce|first2=P. J.|last2=Giblin|title=Curves and Singularities|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1984|ISBN=0-521-42999-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. all of the points γ(''t'') with {{nowrap|1=''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; &amp;epsilon; &lt; ''t'' &lt; ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;epsilon;,}} for sufficiently small ε, will lie on the same side of the [[tangent line]] to γ(''I'') at γ(''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).

Consider the tangent line to γ(''I'') at γ(''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), and consider near-by [[parallel line]]s on the side of the tangent line containing the piece of curve {{nowrap|1=''P'' := {&amp;gamma;(t) &amp;isin; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; : ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; &amp;epsilon; &lt; ''t'' &lt; ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;epsilon;}.}} For parallel lines sufficiently close to the tangent line they will intersect ''P'' in exactly two points. On each parallel line we mark the [[midpoint]] of the [[line segment]] joining these two intersection points. For each parallel line we get a midpoint, and so the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of midpoints traces out a curve starting at ''p''. The limiting tangent line to the locus of midpoints as we approach ''p'' is exactly the affine normal line, i.e. the line containing the affine normal vector to γ(''I'') at γ(''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). Notice that this is an affine invariant construction since parallelism and midpoints are invariant under affine transformations.

Consider the [[parabola]] given by the parametrisation {{nowrap|1=&amp;gamma;(''t'') = (''t'' + 2''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. This has the equation {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 4''xy'' &amp;minus; ''y'' = 0.}} The tangent line at γ(0) has the equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' = 0}} and so the parallel lines are given by {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''k''}} for sufficiently small {{nowrap|1=''k'' &amp;ge; 0.}} The line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''k''}} intersects the curve at {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 2''k'' ± {{radic|''k''}}.}} The locus of midpoints is given by {{nowrap|1={(2''k'',''k'') : ''k'' &amp;ge; 0}.}} These form a line segment, and so the limiting tangent line to this line segment as we tend to γ(0) is just the line containing this line segment, i.e. the line {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 2''y''.}} In that case the affine normal line to the curve at γ(0) has the equation {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 2''y''.}} In fact, direct calculation shows that the affine normal vector at γ(0), namely ξ(0), is given by {{nowrap|1=&amp;xi;(0) = 2&lt;sup&gt;⅓&lt;/sup&gt;·(2,1).}}&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis, D. (2006), Generic Affine Differential Geometry of Curves in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, '' Proc. Royal Soc. Edinburgh'', 136A, 1195&amp;minus;1205.&lt;/ref&gt; In the figure the red curve is the curve γ, the black lines are the tangent line and some near-by tangent lines, the black dots are the midpoints on the displayed lines, and the blue line is the locus of midpoints.

===Surfaces in 3-space===

A similar analogue exists for finding the affine normal line at [[elliptic point]]s of smooth surfaces in 3-space. This time one takes planes parallel to the tangent plane. These, for planes sufficiently close to the tangent plane, intersect the surface to make convex plane curves. Each convex plane curve has a [[centre of mass]]. The locus of centres of mass trace out a curve in 3-space. The limiting tangent line to this locus as one tends to the original surface point is the affine normal line, i.e. the line containing the affine normal vector.

In [[unemployment insurance]] (UI) in the United States, the average high-cost multiple (AHCM) is a commonly used actuarial measure of [[Unemployment Trust Fund]] adequacy. Technically, AHCM is defined as reserve ratio (i.e., the balance of UI trust fund expressed as % of total wages paid in covered employment) divided by average cost rate of three high-cost years in the state's recent history (typically 20 years or a period covering three recessions, whichever is longer). In this definition, cost rate for any duration of time is defined as benefit cost divided by total wages paid in covered employment for the same duration, usually expressed as a percentage.

Intuitively, the AHCM provides an estimate of the length of time (measured in number of years) current reserve in the trust fund (without taking into account future revenue income) can pay out benefits at historically high payout rate. For example, if a state's AHCM is 1.0 immediately prior to a recession, and if the incoming recession is of the average magnitude of the past three recessions, then the state is expected to be able to pay one year of UI benefits using the money already in its trust fund alone. If the AHCM is 0.5, then the state is expected to be able to pay out six months of benefits when the a similar recession hits.

==Example==
As of December 31, 2009, a state has a balance of $500 million in its UI trust fund. The total wages of its covered employment is $40 billion. The reserve ratio for this state on this day is $500/$40000 = 1.25%. Historically, the state experienced three highest-cost years in 1991, 2002, and 2009, when the cost rates were 1.50, 1.80, and 3.00, respectively. The average high-cost rate for this state is therefore 2.10. Thus, the average high-cost multiple is 1.25/2.10 = 0.595.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7553">In the geometry of the [[Euclidean plane]], '''axiality''' is a measure of how much [[axial symmetry]] a shape has. It is defined as the ratio of areas of the largest axially symmetric subset of the shape to the whole shape. Equivalently it is the largest fraction of the area of the shape that can be covered by a mirror reflection of the shape (with any orientation).

A shape that is itself axially symmetric, such as an [[isosceles triangle]], will have an axiality of exactly one, whereas an asymmetric shape, such as a [[scalene triangle]], will have axiality less than one.

==Upper and lower bounds==
{{harvtxt|Lassak|2002}} showed that every [[convex set]] has axiality at least 2/3.&lt;ref name="lassak02"&gt;{{citation

For [[triangle]]s and for [[central symmetry|centrally symmetric]] convex bodies, the axiality is always somewhat higher: every triangle, and every centrally symmetric convex body, has axiality at least &lt;math&gt;2(\sqrt{2}-1)\approx 0.828&lt;/math&gt;. In the set of obtuse triangles whose vertices have &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-coordinates &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the axiality approaches &lt;math&gt;2(\sqrt{2}-1)&lt;/math&gt; in the limit as the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-coordinates approach zero, showing that the lower bound is as large as possible. It is also possible to construct a sequence of centrally symmetric [[parallelogram]]s whose axiality has the same limit, again showing that the lower bound is tight.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

{{harvtxt|Barequet|Rogol|2007}} consider the problem of computing the axiality exactly, for both convex and non-convex polygons. The set of all possible reflection symmetry lines in the plane is (by [[projective duality]]) a two-dimensional space, which they partition into cells within which the pattern of crossings of the polygon with its reflection is fixed, causing the axiality to vary smoothly within each cell. They thus reduce the problem to a numerical computation within each cell, which they do not solve explicitly. The partition of the plane into cells has &lt;math&gt;O(n^4)&lt;/math&gt; cells in the general case, and &lt;math&gt;O(n^3)&lt;/math&gt; cells for convex polygons; it can be constructed in an amount of time which is larger than these bounds by a logarithmic factor. Barequet and Rogol claim that in practice the area maximization problem within a single cell can be solved in &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time, giving (non-rigorous) overall time bounds of &lt;math&gt;O(n^4)&lt;/math&gt; for the convex case and &lt;math&gt;O(n^5)&lt;/math&gt; for the general case.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 4
 | year = 1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He requires each such measure to be invariant under [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity transformation]]s of the given shape, to take the value one for symmetric shapes, and to take a value between zero and one for other shapes. Other symmetry measures with these properties include the ratio of the area of the shape to its smallest enclosing symmetric superset, and the analogous ratios of perimeters.

{{harvtxt|Lassak|2002}}, as well as studying axiality, studies a restricted version of axiality in which the goal is to find a halfspace whose intersection with a convex shape has large area lies entirely within the reflection of the shape across the halfspace boundary. He shows that such an intersection can always be found to have area at least 1/8 that of the whole shape.&lt;ref name="lassak02"/&gt;

In the study of [[computer vision]], {{harvtxt|Marola|1989}} proposed to measure the symmetry of a [[digital image]] (viewed as a function &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; from points in the plane to [[grayscale]] intensity values in the interval &lt;math&gt;0\le w(p)\le 1&lt;/math&gt;) by finding a reflection &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; that maximizes the area integral&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\int\int w(p) w(\sigma(p))dx\,dy}{\int\int w(p)^2 dx\,dy}.&lt;/math&gt;
When &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the [[indicator function]] of a given shape, this is the same as the axiality.

In algebra, a '''basic element''' ''x'' with respect to an element ''y'' is an element of a [[cochain complex]] &lt;math&gt;(C^*, d)&lt;/math&gt; (e.g., complex of [[differential form]]s on a manifold) that is closed: &lt;math&gt;dx = 0&lt;/math&gt; and the contraction of ''x'' by ''y'' is zero.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1942">In [[mathematics]], a '''bidiagonal matrix''' is a [[banded matrix]] with non-zero entries along the main diagonal and ''either'' the diagonal above or the diagonal below. This means there are exactly two non zero diagonals in the matrix.

When the diagonal above the main diagonal has the non-zero entries the matrix is '''upper bidiagonal'''.  When the diagonal below the main diagonal has the non-zero entries the matrix is '''lower bidiagonal'''.

For example, the following matrix is '''upper bidiagonal''':
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 3 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and the following matrix is '''lower bidiagonal''':

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
2 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 3 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 \\
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Usage==
One variant of the [[QR algorithm]] starts with reducing a general matrix into a bidiagonal one,&lt;ref&gt;Bochkanov Sergey Anatolyevich. ALGLIB User Guide - General Matrix operations - Singular value decomposition . ALGLIB Project. 2010-12-11. URL:http://www.alglib.net/matrixops/general/svd.php. Accessed: 2010-12-11. (Archived by WebCite at https://www.webcitation.org/5utO4iSnR)&lt;/ref&gt;
and the [[Singular value decomposition]] uses this method as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23348">In [[algebraic geometry]], the '''Chow groups''' (named after [[Wei-Liang Chow]] by {{harvs|txt|last=Chevalley|first=Claude|authorlink=Claude Chevalley|year=1958}}) of an [[algebraic variety]] over any [[field (mathematics)|field]] are algebro-geometric analogs of the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] of a [[topological space]]. The elements of the Chow group are formed out of subvarieties (so-called [[algebraic cycles]]) in a similar way to how simplicial or cellular homology groups are formed out of subcomplexes.  When the variety is [[smooth scheme|smooth]], the Chow groups can be interpreted as cohomology groups (compare [[Poincaré duality]]) and have a multiplication called the [[intersection product]].  The Chow groups carry rich information about an algebraic variety, and they are correspondingly hard to compute in general.

==Rational equivalence and Chow groups==
For what follows, define a '''variety''' over a field ''k'' to be an [[Glossary of algebraic geometry#integral|integral]] [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] of [[Glossary of algebraic geometry#finite type (locally)|finite type]] over ''k''. For any scheme ''X'' of finite type over ''k'', an '''algebraic cycle''' on ''X'' means a finite [[linear combination]] of subvarieties of ''X'' with [[integer]] coefficients.  (Here and below, subvarieties are understood to be closed in ''X'', unless stated otherwise.) For a [[natural number]] ''i'', the group ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') of ''i''-dimensional cycles (or ''i''-'''cycles''', for short) on ''X'' is the [[free abelian group]] on the set of ''i''-dimensional subvarieties of ''X''.

For a variety ''W'' of dimension ''i'' + 1 and any [[function field of an algebraic variety|rational function]] ''f'' on ''W'' which is not identically zero, the [[divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]] of ''f'' is the ''i''-cycle
:&lt;math&gt;(f) = \sum_Z \operatorname{ord}_Z (f) Z,&lt;/math&gt;
where the sum runs over all ''i''-dimensional subvarieties ''Z'' of ''W'' and the integer ord&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'') denotes the order of vanishing of ''f'' along ''Z''. (Thus ord&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'') is negative if ''f'' has a pole along ''Z''.) The definition of the order of vanishing requires some care for ''W'' singular.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton. Intersection Theory, section 1.2 and Appendix A.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a scheme ''X'' of finite type over ''k'', the group of ''i''-cycles '''rationally equivalent to zero''' is the subgroup of ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') generated by the cycles (''f'') for all (''i''+1)-dimensional subvarieties ''W'' of ''X'' and all nonzero rational functions ''f'' on ''W''. The '''Chow group''' ''CH''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(X) of ''i''-dimensional cycles on ''X'' is the [[quotient group]] of ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') by the subgroup of cycles rationally equivalent to zero. Sometimes one writes [''Z''] for the class of a subvariety ''Z'' in the Chow group, and if two subvarieties ''Z'' and ''W'' have [''Z''] = [''W''], then ''Z'' and ''W'' are said to be '''rationally equivalent.'''

For example, when ''X'' is a variety of dimension ''n'', the Chow group ''CH''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;(X) is the [[divisor class group]] of ''X''. When ''X'' is smooth over ''k'', this is isomorphic to the [[Picard group]] of [[invertible sheaf|line bundle]]s on ''X''.

==The Chow ring==
When the scheme ''X'' is smooth over a field ''k'', the Chow groups form a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], not just a graded abelian group. Namely, when ''X'' is smooth over ''k'', define ''CH''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') to be the Chow group of [[codimension]]-''i'' cycles on ''X''. (When ''X'' is a variety of dimension ''n'', this just means that ''CH''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') = ''CH''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'').) Then the groups ''CH''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') form a commutative [[graded ring]], with a product:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{CH}^i(X) \times \mathit{CH}^j(X) \rightarrow \mathit{CH}^{i+j}(X).&lt;/math&gt;

The product arises from intersecting algebraic cycles. For example, if ''Y'' and ''Z'' are smooth subvarieties of ''X'' of codimension ''i'' and ''j'' respectively, and if ''Y'' and ''Z'' intersect [[transversality (mathematics)|transversely]], then the product [''Y''][''Z''] in ''CH''&lt;sup&gt;''i''+''j''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') is the sum of the irreducible components of the intersection ''Y'' ∩ ''Z'', which all have codimension {{math|''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''j''}}.

More generally, in various cases, [[intersection theory]] constructs an explicit cycle that represents the product [''Y''][''Z''] in the Chow ring. For example, if ''Y'' and ''Z'' are subvarieties of complementary dimension (meaning that their dimensions sum to the dimension of ''X'') whose intersection has dimension zero, then [''Y''][''Z''] is equal to the sum of the points of the intersection with coefficients called [[intersection number]]s. For any subvarieties ''Y'' and ''Z'' of a smooth scheme ''X'' over ''k'', with no assumption on the dimension of the intersection, [[William Fulton (mathematician)|William Fulton]] and [[Robert MacPherson (mathematician)|Robert MacPherson]]'s intersection theory constructs a canonical element of the Chow groups of ''Y'' ∩ ''Z'' whose image in the Chow groups of ''X'' is the product [''Y''][''Z''].&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, Intersection Theory, section 8.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Projective space===
The Chow ring of [[projective space]] '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; over any field ''k'' is the ring

: &lt;math&gt;\mathit{CH}^*(\mathbf{P}^n) \cong \mathbb{Z}[H]/(H^{n + 1}),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H'' is the class of any hyperplane (the zero locus of a single linear function). Furthermore, any subvariety ''Y'' of [[degree of a projective variety|degree]] ''a'' and codimension ''r'' in projective space is rationally equivalent to ''aH''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;. It follows that for any two subvarieties ''Y'' and ''Z'' of complementary dimension in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and degrees ''a'', ''b'' respectively, their product in the Chow ring is simply

: &lt;math&gt;[Y] \cdot [Z] = a\, b\, H^n&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the class of a ''k''-rational point in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, if ''Y'' and ''Z'' intersect transversely, it follows that ''Y'' ∩ ''Z'' is a zero-cycle of degree ''ab''. If the base field ''k'' is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]], this means that there are exactly ''ab'' points of intersection; this is a version of [[Bézout's theorem]], a classic result of [[enumerative geometry]].

=== Projective bundle formula ===
Given a vector bundle &lt;math&gt;E \to X&lt;/math&gt; of rank &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; over a smooth proper scheme ''X'' over a field, the Chow ring of the [[associated projective bundle]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(E)&lt;/math&gt; can be computed using the chow ring of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and the Chern classes of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. If we let &lt;math&gt;\zeta = c_1(O_{\mathbb{P}(E)}(1))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_1,\ldots,c_k&lt;/math&gt; the Chern classes of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, then there is an isomorphism of rings
:&lt;math&gt;
A^\bullet(\mathbb{P}(E)) \cong \frac{A^\bullet(X)[\zeta]}{\zeta^k + c_1\zeta^{k-1} + c_2\zeta^{k-2} + \cdots + c_k} 
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Hirzebruch surfaces ====
For example, the Chow ring of a [[Hirzebruch surface]] can be readily computed using the projective bundle formula. Recall that it is constructed as &lt;math&gt;F_a = \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}\oplus\mathcal{O}(a))&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^1&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the only non-trivial Chern class of this vector bundle is &lt;math&gt;c_1 = a[H]&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that the Chow ring is isomorphic to
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{A^\bullet(\mathbb{P}^1)[\zeta]}{(\zeta^2 + a[H]\zeta)}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Remarks ===
For other algebraic varieties, Chow groups can have richer behavior. For example, let ''X'' be an [[elliptic curve]] over a field ''k''. Then the Chow group of zero-cycles on ''X'' fits into an [[exact sequence]]
:&lt;math&gt; 0 \rightarrow X(k) \rightarrow \mathit{CH}_0(X) \rightarrow \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the Chow group of an elliptic curve ''X'' is closely related to the group ''X''(''k'') of ''k''-[[rational point]]s of ''X''. When ''k'' is a [[number field]], ''X''(''k'') is called the [[Mordell–Weil group]] of ''X'', and some of the deepest problems in number theory are attempts to understand this group. When ''k'' is the complex numbers, the example of an elliptic curve shows that Chow groups can be [[uncountable]] abelian groups.

==Functoriality==
For a [[proper morphism]] ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' of schemes over ''k'', there is a '''pushforward homomorphism''' ''f''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;: ''CH''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') → ''CH''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'') for each integer ''i''. For example, for a [[complete variety|proper scheme]] ''X'' over ''k'', this gives a homomorphism ''CH''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') → '''Z''', which takes a closed point in ''X'' to its degree over ''k''. (A closed point in ''X'' has the form Spec(''E'') for a finite extension field ''E'' of ''k'', and its degree means the [[degree of a field extension|degree]] of the field ''E'' over ''k''.)

For a [[flat morphism]] ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' of schemes over ''k'' with fibers of dimension ''r'' (possibly empty),  there is a '''[[Gysin homomorphism|homomorphism]]''' ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;: ''CH''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'') → ''CH''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'').

A key computational tool for Chow groups is the '''localization sequence''', as follows. For a scheme ''X'' over a field ''k'' and a closed subscheme ''Z'' of ''k'', there is an [[exact sequence]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{CH}_i(Z) \rightarrow \mathit{CH}_i(X) \rightarrow \mathit{CH}_i(X-Z) \rightarrow 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where the first homomorphism is the pushforward associated to the proper morphism ''Z'' → ''X'', and the second homomorphism is pullback with respect to the flat morphism ''X'' − ''Z'' → ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, Intersection Theory, Proposition 1.8.&lt;/ref&gt; The localization sequence can be extended to the left using a generalization of Chow groups, (Borel–Moore) [[motivic cohomology|motivic homology]] groups, also known as '''[[higher Chow groups]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Algebraic cycles and higher K-groups; Voevodsky, Triangulated categories of motives over a field, section 2.2 and Proposition 4.2.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

For any morphism ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' of smooth schemes over ''k'', there is a pullback homomorphism ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;: ''CH''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''Y'') → ''CH''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X''), which is in fact a ring homomorphism ''CH''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''Y'') → ''CH''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'').

===Examples of flat pullbacks===
Note that non-examples can be constructed using blowups; for example, if we take the blowup of the origin in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}^2&lt;/math&gt; then the fiber over the origin is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^1&lt;/math&gt;.
==== Branched coverings of curves ====
Consider the branched covering of curves
:&lt;math&gt;f: \operatorname{Spec}\left( \frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y]}{(f(x) - g(x,y))} \right) \to \mathbb{A}^1_x&lt;/math&gt;
Since the morphism ramifies whenever &lt;math&gt;f(\alpha) = 0&lt;/math&gt; we get a factorization
:&lt;math&gt;g(\alpha,y) = (y - a_1)^{e_1}\cdots(y-a_k)^{e_k}&lt;/math&gt;
where one of the &lt;math&gt;e_i&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that the points &lt;math&gt;\{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k \} = f^{-1}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; have multiplicities &lt;math&gt;e_1,\ldots,e_k&lt;/math&gt; respectively. The flat pullback of the point &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is then
:&lt;math&gt;f^*[\alpha] = e_1[\alpha] + \cdots + e_k[\alpha_k]&lt;/math&gt;
==== Flat family of varieties ====
Consider a flat family of varieties
:&lt;math&gt;X \to S&lt;/math&gt;
and a subvariety &lt;math&gt;S' \subset S&lt;/math&gt;. Then, using the cartesian square
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
S'\times_{S} X &amp; \to &amp; X \\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow \\
S' &amp; \to &amp; S
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
we see that the image of &lt;math&gt;S'\times_{S} X&lt;/math&gt; is a subvariety of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore we have
:&lt;math&gt;f^*[S'] = [S'\times_S X]&lt;/math&gt;

==Cycle maps==
There are several homomorphisms (known as '''cycle maps''') from Chow groups to more computable theories.

First, for a scheme ''X'' over the complex numbers, there is a homomorphism from Chow groups to [[Borel–Moore homology]]:&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, Intersection Theory, section 19.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{CH}_i(X) \rightarrow H_{2i}^{BM}(X,\mathbf{Z}).&lt;/math&gt;
The factor of 2 appears because an ''i''-dimensional subvariety of ''X'' has real dimension 2''i''. When ''X'' is smooth over the complex numbers, this cycle map can be rewritten using [[Poincaré duality]] as a homomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{CH}^j(X) \rightarrow H^{2j}(X,\mathbf{Z}).&lt;/math&gt;
In this case (''X'' smooth over '''C'''), these homomorphisms form a ring homomorphism from the Chow ring to the cohomology ring. Intuitively, this is because the products in both the Chow ring and the cohomology ring describe the intersection of cycles.

For a smooth complex [[projective variety]], the cycle map from the Chow ring to ordinary cohomology factors through a richer theory, [[Deligne cohomology]].&lt;ref&gt;Voisin, Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry, v. 1, section 12.3.3; v. 2, Theorem 9.24.&lt;/ref&gt; This incorporates the [[Abel–Jacobi map]] from cycles homologically equivalent to zero to the [[intermediate Jacobian]]. The [[exponential sequence]] shows that ''CH''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') maps isomorphically to Deligne cohomology, but that fails for ''CH''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') with ''j'' &gt; 1.

For a scheme ''X'' over an arbitrary field ''k'', there is an analogous cycle map from Chow groups to (Borel–Moore) [[etale cohomology|etale homology]]. When ''X'' is smooth over ''k'', this homomorphism can be identified with a ring homomorphism from the Chow ring to etale cohomology.&lt;ref&gt;Deligne, Cohomologie Etale (SGA 4 1/2), Expose 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to K-theory==
An (algebraic) [[vector bundle]] ''E'' on a smooth scheme ''X'' over a field has [[Chern class]]es ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''E'') in ''CH''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X''), with the same formal properties as in topology.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, Intersection Theory, section 3.2 and Example 8.3.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chern classes give a close connection between vector bundles and Chow groups. Namely, let ''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') be the [[Grothendieck group]] of vector bundles on ''X''. As part of the [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]], [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]] showed that the [[Chern character]] gives an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;K_0(X)\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}}\mathbf{Q} \cong \prod_i \mathit{CH}^i(X)\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}}\mathbf{Q}.&lt;/math&gt;
This isomorphism shows the importance of rational equivalence, compared to any other [[adequate equivalence relation]] on algebraic cycles.

==Conjectures==
Some of the deepest conjectures in algebraic geometry and number theory are attempts to understand Chow groups. For example:

*The [[Mordell–Weil theorem]] implies that the divisor class group ''CH''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') is finitely generated for any variety ''X'' of dimension ''n'' over a number field. It is an open problem whether all Chow groups are finitely generated for every variety over a number field. The [[Spencer Bloch|Bloch]]–[[Kazuya Kato|Kato]] conjecture on [[Special values of L-functions|values of L-functions]] predicts that these groups are finitely generated. Moreover, the rank of the group of cycles modulo homological equivalence, and also of the group of cycles homologically equivalent to zero, should be equal to the order of vanishing of an L-function of the given variety at certain integer points. Finiteness of these ranks would also follow from the [[Bass conjecture]] in algebraic K-theory.
*For a smooth complex projective variety ''X'', the [[Hodge conjecture]] predicts the image ([[tensor product|tensored]] with the rationals '''Q''') of the cycle map from the Chow groups to singular cohomology. For a smooth projective variety over a finitely generated field (such as a [[finite field]] or number field), the [[Tate conjecture]] predicts the image (tensored with '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;) of the cycle map from Chow groups to [[l-adic cohomology]].
*For a smooth projective variety ''X'' over any field, the [[Spencer Bloch|Bloch]]–[[Alexander Beilinson|Beilinson]] conjecture predicts a filtration on the Chow groups of ''X'' (tensored with the rationals) with strong properties.&lt;ref&gt;Voisin, Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry, v. 2, Conjecture 11.21.&lt;/ref&gt; The conjecture would imply a tight connection between the singular or etale cohomology of ''X'' and the Chow groups of ''X''.

:For example, let ''X'' be a smooth complex projective surface. The Chow group of zero-cycles on ''X'' maps onto the integers by the degree homomorphism; let ''K'' be the kernel. If the [[geometric genus]] ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'', Ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is not zero, [[David Mumford|Mumford]] showed that ''K'' is "infinite-dimensional" (not the image of any finite-dimensional family of zero-cycles on ''X'').&lt;ref&gt;Voisin, Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry, v. 2, Theorem 10.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bloch–Beilinson conjecture would imply a satisfying converse, '''Bloch's conjecture on zero-cycles''': for a smooth complex projective surface ''X'' with geometric genus zero, ''K'' should be finite-dimensional; more precisely, it should map isomorphically to the group of complex points of the [[Albanese variety]] of ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;Voisin, Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry, v. 2, Ch. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==

=== Bivariant theory ===

[[William Fulton (mathematician)|Fulton]] and [[Robert MacPherson (mathematician)|MacPherson]] extended the Chow ring to singular varieties by defining the "operational Chow ring" and more generally a bivariant theory associated to any morphism of schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, Intersection Theory, Chapter 17.&lt;/ref&gt; A bivariant theory is a pair of covariant and contravariant [[Functor|functors]] that assign to a map a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] and a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] respectively. It generalizes a [[cohomology theory]], which is a contravariant functor that assigns to a space a ring, namely a [[cohomology ring]]. The name "bivariant" refers to the fact that the theory contains both covariant and contravariant functors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pR7UCQAAQBAJ|title=Categorical Framework for the Study of Singular Spaces|last=Fulton|first=William|last2=MacPherson|first2=Robert|date=1981|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|year=|isbn=9780821822432|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is in a sense the most elementary extension of the Chow ring to singular varieties; other theories such as [[motivic cohomology]] map to the operational Chow ring.&lt;ref&gt;B. Totaro, [http://www.math.ucla.edu/~totaro/papers/public_html/linear5.pdf Chow groups, Chow cohomology and linear varieties]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other variants ===

[[Arithmetic Chow group]]s are an amalgamation of Chow groups of varieties over '''Q''' together with a component encoding [[Arakelov theory|Arakelov-theoretical]] information, that is, [[differential form]]s on the associated complex manifold.

The theory of Chow groups of schemes of finite type over a field extends easily to that of [[algebraic space]]s. The key advantage of this extension is that it is easier to form quotients in the latter category and thus it is more natural to consider [[equivariant Chow group]]s of algebraic spaces. A much more formidable extension is that of [[Chow group of a stack]], which has been constructed only in some special case and which is needed in particular to make sense of a [[virtual fundamental class]].

==History==
Rational equivalence of divisors (known as [[Divisor (algebraic geometry)#Divisor class group|linear equivalence]]) was studied in various forms during the 19th century, leading to the [[ideal class group]] in number theory and the [[Jacobian variety]] in the theory of algebraic curves. For higher-codimension cycles, rational equivalence was introduced by [[Francesco Severi|Severi]] in the 1930s. In 1956, [[Wei-Liang Chow]] gave an influential proof that the intersection product is well-defined on cycles modulo rational equivalence for a smooth quasi-projective variety, using [[Chow's moving lemma]]. Starting in the 1970s, [[William Fulton (mathematician)|Fulton]] and [[Robert MacPherson (mathematician)|MacPherson]] gave the current standard foundation for Chow groups, working with singular varieties wherever possible. In their theory, the intersection product for smooth varieties is constructed by [[Blowing up#Related constructions|deformation to the normal cone]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, Intersection Theory, Chapters 5, 6, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17779">In [[mathematics]], and in particular in [[combinatorics]], the '''combinatorial number system''' of degree ''k'' (for some positive integer ''k''), also referred to as '''combinadics''', is a correspondence between [[natural number]]s (taken to include&amp;nbsp;0) ''N'' and ''k''-[[combination]]s, represented as [[strictly decreasing]] sequences ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0. Since the latter are strings of numbers, one can view this as a kind of [[numeral system]] for representing ''N'', although the main utility is representing a ''k''-combination by ''N'' rather than the other way around. Distinct numbers correspond to distinct ''k''-combinations, and produce them in [[lexicographic order]]; moreover the numbers less than &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; correspond to all ''k''-combinations of {{nowrap|{ 0, 1, ..., ''n'' − 1}}}. The correspondence does not depend on the size&amp;nbsp;''n'' of the set that the ''k''-combinations are taken from, so it can be interpreted as a map from '''N''' to the ''k''-combinations taken from '''N'''; in this view the correspondence is a [[bijective map|bijection]].

The number ''N'' corresponding to (''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is given by

:&lt;math&gt;N=\binom{c_k}k+\cdots+\binom{c_2}2+\binom{c_1}1.&lt;/math&gt;

The fact that a unique sequence so corresponds to any number ''N'' was observed by [[Derrick Henry Lehmer|D. H. Lehmer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Applied Combinatorial Mathematics'', Ed. E. F. Beckenbach (1964), pp.27−30.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed a [[greedy algorithm]] finds the ''k''-combination corresponding to ''N'': take ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; maximal with &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{c_k}k\leq N&lt;/math&gt;, then take ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt; maximal with &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{c_{k-1}}{k-1}\leq N - \tbinom{c_k}k&lt;/math&gt;, and so forth. Finding the number ''N'', using the formula above, from the ''k''-combination (''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is also known as "ranking", and the opposite operation (given by the greedy algorithm) as "unranking"; these operations are known by those names in most [[computer algebra system]]s, and in computational mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~lucia/courses/5165-09/GenCombObj.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/combinat/subset.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[factorial number system]], the combinatorial number system of degree ''k'' is not a [[mixed radix]] system: the part &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{c_i}i&lt;/math&gt; of the number ''N'' represented by a "digit" ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is not obtained from it by simply multiplying by a place value.

The main application of the combinatorial number system is that it allows rapid computation of the ''k''-combination that is at a given position in the lexicographic ordering, without having to explicitly list the ''k''-combinations preceding it; this allows for instance random generation of ''k''-combinations of a given set. [[Enumerative combinatorics|Enumeration of ''k''-combinations]] has many applications, among which [[software testing]], [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]], [[quality control]], and the analysis of [[lottery]] games.

== Ordering combinations ==

A ''k''-combination of a set ''S'' is a subset of ''S'' with ''k'' (distinct) elements. The main purpose of the combinatorial number system is to provide a representation, each by a single number, of all &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; possible ''k''-combinations of a set ''S'' of ''n'' elements. Choosing, for any ''n'', {{nowrap|{0, 1, ..., ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}} as such a set, it can be arranged that the representation of a given ''k''-combination ''C'' is independent of the value of ''n'' (although ''n'' must of course be sufficiently large); in other words considering ''C'' as a subset of a larger set by increasing ''n'' will not change the number that represents&amp;nbsp;''C''. Thus for the combinatorial number system one just considers ''C'' as a ''k''-combination of the set '''N''' of all natural numbers, without explicitly mentioning ''n''.

In order to ensure that the numbers representing the ''k''-combinations of {{nowrap|{0, 1, ..., ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}} are less than those representing ''k''-combinations not contained in {{nowrap|{0, 1, ..., ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}}, the ''k''-combinations must be ordered in such a way that their largest elements are compared first. The most natural ordering that has this property is [[lexicographic order]]ing of the ''decreasing'' sequence of their elements. So comparing the 5-combinations ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{0,3,4,6,9} and ''C''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{0,1,3,7,9}, one has that ''C'' comes before ''C''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, since they have the same largest part&amp;nbsp;9, but the next largest part&amp;nbsp;6 of ''C'' is less than the next largest part&amp;nbsp;7 of ''C''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;; the sequences compared lexicographically are (9,6,4,3,0) and (9,7,3,1,0). Another way to describe this ordering is view combinations as describing the ''k'' raised bits in the binary representation of a number, so that ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} describes the number
:&lt;math&gt;2^{c_1}+2^{c_2}+\cdots+2^{c_k}&lt;/math&gt;
(this associates distinct numbers to ''all'' finite sets of natural numbers); then comparison of ''k''-combinations can be done by comparing the associated binary numbers. In the example ''C'' and ''C''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; correspond to numbers 1001011001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;601&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and 1010001011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;651&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, which again shows that ''C'' comes before ''C''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This number is not however the one one wants to represent the ''k''-combination with, since many binary numbers have a number of raised bits different from ''k''; one wants to find the relative position of ''C'' in the ordered list of (only) ''k''-combinations.

== Place of a combination in the ordering ==

The number associated in the combinatorial number system of degree ''k'' to a ''k''-combination ''C'' is the number of ''k''-combinations strictly less than ''C'' in the given ordering. This number can be computed from ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{ ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;} with ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as follows. From the definition of the ordering it follows that for each ''k''-combination ''S'' strictly less than&amp;nbsp;''C'', there is a unique index&amp;nbsp;''i'' such that ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is absent from ''S'', while ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; are present in ''S'', and no other value larger than ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is. One can therefore group those ''k''-combinations ''S'' according to the possible values 1, 2, ..., ''k'' of ''i'', and count each group separately. For a given value of ''i'' one must include
''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; in ''S'', and the remaining ''i'' elements of ''S'' must be chosen from the ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; non-negative integers strictly less than ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;; moreover any such choice will result in a ''k''-combinations ''S'' strictly less than&amp;nbsp;''C''. The number of possible choices is &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{c_i}i&lt;/math&gt;, which is therefore the number of combinations in group ''i''; the total number of ''k''-combinations strictly less than ''C'' then is
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{c_1}1+\binom{c_2}2+\cdots+\binom{c_k}k,&lt;/math&gt;
and this is the index (starting from&amp;nbsp;0) of ''C'' in the  ordered list of ''k''-combinations. Obviously there is for every ''N''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''N''' exactly one ''k''-combination at index&amp;nbsp;''N'' in the list (supposing ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, since the list is then infinite), so the above argument proves that every ''N'' can be written in exactly one way as a sum of ''k'' binomial coefficients of the given form.

== Finding the ''k''-combination for a given number ==

The given formula allows finding the place in the lexicographic ordering of a given ''k''-combination immediately. The reverse process of finding the ''k''-combination at a given place ''N'' requires somewhat more work, but is straightforward nonetheless. By the definition of the lexicographic ordering, two ''k''-combinations that differ in their largest element ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; will be ordered according to the comparison of those largest elements, from which it follows that all combinations with a fixed value of their largest element are contiguous in the list. Moreover the smallest combination with ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; as largest element is &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{c_k}k&lt;/math&gt;, and it has ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 for all ''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''k'' (for this combination  all terms in the expression except &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{c_k}k&lt;/math&gt; are zero). Therefore ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the largest number such that &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{c_k}k\leq N&lt;/math&gt;. If ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1 the remaining elements of the ''k''-combination form the {{nowrap|''k'' − 1}}-combination corresponding to the number &lt;math&gt;N-\tbinom{c_k}k&lt;/math&gt; in the combinatorial number system of degree {{nowrap|''k'' − 1}}, and can therefore be found by continuing in the same way for  &lt;math&gt;N-\tbinom{c_k}k&lt;/math&gt; and {{nowrap|''k'' − 1}} instead of ''N'' and  ''k''.

=== Example ===

Suppose one wants to determine the 5-combination at position 72. The successive values of &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n5&lt;/math&gt; for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, 5, 6, ... are 0, 1, 6, 21, 56, 126, 252, ..., of which the largest one not exceeding 72 is 56, for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8. Therefore ''c''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8, and the remaining elements form the 4-combination at position {{nowrap|72 − 56 {{=}} 16}}. The successive values of &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n4&lt;/math&gt; for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, 4, 5, ... are 0, 1, 5, 15, 35, ..., of which the largest one not exceeding 16 is 15, for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6, so ''c''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6. Continuing similarly to search for a 3-combination at position {{nowrap|16 − 15 {{=}} 1}} one finds ''c''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, which uses up the final unit; this establishes &lt;math&gt;72=\tbinom85+\tbinom64+\tbinom33&lt;/math&gt;, and the remaining values ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; will be the maximal ones with &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{c_i}i=0&lt;/math&gt;, namely {{nowrap|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''i'' − 1}}. Thus we have found the 5-combination {{nowrap|{8, 6, 3, 1, 0}}}.

=== National Lottery example in Excel ===

For each of the &lt;math&gt;\binom{49}6&lt;/math&gt; lottery combinations ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;, there is a list number ''N'' between 0 and &lt;math&gt;\binom{49}6 - 1&lt;/math&gt; which can be found by adding

: &lt;math&gt; \binom{49-c_1} 6 + \binom{49-c_2} 5 + \binom{49-c_3} 4 + \binom{49-c_4} 3 + \binom{49-c_5} 2 + \binom{49-c_6} 1. &lt;/math&gt;

Suppose you want to find a position of a British National Lottery result 3,6,15,17,18,35 in a list of possible results. Excel function COMBIN(49,6) would show that number of results is 13983816. Now if you put numbers 3,6,15,17,18,35 each in its cell and formulas COMBIN(49-3,6), COMBIN(49-6,5), COMBIN(49-15,4), COMBIN(49-17,3), COMBIN(49-18,2), 49−35 under each of them. Use cell references instead of actual values, the actual values are provided for readability. You would get a row of numbers of 9366819,962598,46376,4960,465,14. Adding these would show particular position 10381232. Note that you do not need use formula COMBIN(49-35,1) to get 14. You can have it by subtraction 49-35 alone. Also the COMBIN function does not return 0 in case 49-X becomes less than 6. You'd need to use IF with ISNUMBER function to convert #NUM! into 0.

Now the reverse engineering is a bit trickier. You could use 49 IF statements in one cell or use solver to find maximum argument for COMBIN result to be less or equal than position number. Instead let's use a table of 6 by 49 and use MATCH function where resulting row number would be the argument and a ball number. If you make column headings from 6 to 1 (B1:G1) in descending order and row labels of 1 to 49 (A2:A50) in ascending order (vertically ascending in Excel means numbers growing from top to bottom). Then if you fill up the table with formula COMBIN($A2,B$1) starting from left top corner. $ signs will make sure that index values are always taken from heading row and label column. Replace #NUM! with zeros. You should get something like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
	6	5	4	3	2	1
1	0	0	0	0	0	1
2	0	0	0	0	1	2
3	0	0	0	1	3	3
4	0	0	1	4	6	4
5	0	1	5	10	10	5
6	1	6	15	20	15	6
7	7	21	35	35	21	7
8	28	56	70	56	28	8
9	84	126	126	84	36	9
10	210	252	210	120	45	10
11	462	462	330	165	55	11
12	924	792	495	220	66	12
...
49	13983816	1906884	211876	18424	1176	49
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now if you create a new row of six cells and fill them with formulas which would find the largest values in each column which are less than or equal to position number in question:
The first cell with =INDEX(B2:B50,MATCH(10381232,B2:B50)), the rest of the cells with
&lt;pre&gt;
INDEX(C2:C50,MATCH(10381232-SUM(of previous cells),C2:C50))
...
INDEX(G2:G50,MATCH(10381232-SUM(of previous cells),G2:G50))
&lt;/pre&gt;
This would present you with a row of values you have already seen 9366819,962598,46376,4960,465,14
Now in a next row first cell write =49-MATCH(10381232,B2:B50) and similarly
&lt;pre&gt;
=49-MATCH(10381232-9366819,C2:C50)
...
=49-MATCH(10381232-9366819-962598-46376-4960-465,G2:G50)
&lt;/pre&gt;
Again use the references to cells instead of actual values. You should be presented with original ball numbers of 3,6,15,17,18,35.

Now you can generate a fresh Lottery number combination from single =randbetween(1,combin(49,6)) or you could look at the list position numbers of earlier results to see if there is a trend.

== Applications ==

One could use the combinatorial number system to list or traverse all ''k''-combinations of a given finite set, but this is a very inefficient way to do that. Indeed, given some ''k''-combination it is much easier to find the next combination in lexicographic ordering directly than to convert a number to a ''k''-combination by the method indicated above. To find the next combination, find the smallest ''i''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 for which ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i−1''&lt;/sub&gt;+2 (if there is no such ''i'', take ''i'' = ''k''+1); then increase ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt; by one and set all ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; with {{nowrap|''j'' &amp;lt; ''i'' − 1}} to their minimal value {{nowrap|''j'' − 1}}. If the ''k''-combination is represented by its [[Characteristic vector (disambiguation)|characteristic vector]], that is as a binary value with ''k'' bits&amp;nbsp;1, then the next such value can be computed without any loop using bitwise arithmetic: the following [[C++]] function will advance &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; to that value or return &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="cpp"&gt;
// find next k-combination
bool next_combination(unsigned long&amp; x) // assume x has form x'01^a10^b in binary
{
  unsigned long u = x &amp; -x; // extract rightmost bit 1; u =  0'00^a10^b
  unsigned long v = u + x; // set last non-trailing bit 0, and clear to the right; v=x'10^a00^b
  if (v==0) // then overflow in v, or x==0
    return false; // signal that next k-combination cannot be represented
  x = v +(((v^x)/u)&gt;&gt;2); // v^x = 0'11^a10^b, (v^x)/u = 0'0^b1^{a+2}, and x ← x'100^b1^a
  return true; // successful completion
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

corresponding [[assembly code]] was described as item 175 in [[HAKMEM]].

On the other hand the possibility to directly generate the ''k''-combination at index ''N'' has useful applications. Notably, it allows generating a random ''k''-combination of an ''n''-element set using a random integer ''N'' with &lt;math&gt;0\leq N&lt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt;, simply by converting that number to the corresponding ''k''-combination. If a computer program needs to maintain a table with information about every ''k''-combination of a given finite set, the computation of the index ''N'' associated with a combination will allow the table to be accessed without searching.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1708">In [[computability theory]] '''complete numberings''' are generalizations of [[Numbering (computability theory)|Gödel numbering]] first introduced by [[A.I. Mal'tsev]] in 1963. They are studied because several important results like the [[Kleene's recursion theorem]] and [[Rice's theorem]], which were originally proven for the Gödel-numbered set of [[computable function]]s, still hold for arbitrary sets with complete numberings.

== Definition ==

A [[numbering (computability theory)|numbering]] &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called '''complete''' (with respect to an element &lt;math&gt;a \in A&lt;/math&gt;) if for every [[partial computable function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; there exists a [[total computable function]] &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; so that (Ershov&amp;nbsp;1999:482):
:&lt;math&gt; \nu \circ h(i) = 
\left\{
\begin{matrix} 
\nu \circ f(i) &amp;\mbox{if}\ i \in \mathrm{dom}(f), \\
a &amp;\mbox{otherwise}.
\end{matrix}
\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

Ershov refers to the element ''a'' as a "special" element for the numbering.  A numbering &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is called '''precomplete''' if the weaker property holds:
:&lt;math&gt; \nu \circ f(i) = \nu \circ h(i) \qquad i \in \mathrm{dom}(f).\,&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

* Any numbering of a [[singleton set]] is complete
* The [[identity function]] on the natural numbers is ''not'' complete
* A [[Numbering (computability theory)|Gödel numbering]] is precomplete

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5302">The '''empirical probability''', '''[[Frequency (statistics)|relative frequency]]''', or '''experimental probability''' of an event is the ratio of the number of outcomes in which a specified event occurs to the total number of trials,&lt;ref name=Mood&gt;{{cite book |last=Mood |first=A. M. |last2=Graybill |first2=F. A. |last3=Boes |first3=D. C. |year=1974 |title=Introduction to the Theory of Statistics |edition=3rd |publisher=McGraw-Hill |chapter=Section 2.3 |isbn=0070428646 }}&lt;/ref&gt; not in a theoretical sample space but in an actual experiment.  In a more general sense, empirical probability estimates probabilities from [[experience]] and [[observation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tpub.com/math2/90.htm Empirical probabilities at tpub.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Given an event ''A'' in a sample space, the relative frequency of ''A'' is the ratio ''m/n'', ''m'' being the number of outcomes in which the event ''A'' occurs, and ''n'' being the total number of outcomes of the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gujarati |first=Damodar N. |year=2003 |title=Basic Econometrics |edition=4th |publisher=McGraw-Hill |chapter=Appendix A |isbn=978-0-07-233542-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In statistical terms, the empirical probability is an ''estimate'' or [[estimator]] of a probability. In simple cases, where the result of a trial only determines whether or not the specified event has occurred, modelling using a [[binomial distribution]] might be appropriate and then the empirical estimate is the [[maximum likelihood estimate]]. It is the [[Bayesian estimate]] for the same case if certain assumptions are made for the [[prior distribution]] of the probability. If a trial yields more information, the empirical probability can be improved on by adopting further assumptions in the form of a [[statistical model]]: if such a model is fitted, it can be used to derive an estimate of the probability of the specified event.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

===Advantages===
An advantage of estimating probabilities using empirical probabilities is that this procedure is relatively free of assumptions.

For example, consider estimating the probability among a population of men that they satisfy two conditions:
# that they are over 6 [[Foot (unit)|feet]] in height.
# that they prefer strawberry jam to raspberry jam.

A direct estimate could be found by counting the number of men who satisfy both conditions to give the empirical probability of the combined condition. An alternative estimate could be found by multiplying the proportion of men who are over 6&amp;nbsp;feet in height with the proportion of men who prefer strawberry jam to raspberry jam, but this estimate relies on the assumption that the two conditions are [[statistically independent]].

===Disadvantages===
A disadvantage in using empirical probabilities arises in estimating probabilities which are either very close to zero, or very close to one. In these cases very large sample sizes would be needed in order to estimate such probabilities to a good standard of relative accuracy. Here [[statistical model]]s can help, depending on the context, and in general one can hope that such models would provide improvements in accuracy compared to empirical probabilities, provided that the assumptions involved actually do hold.

For example, consider estimating the probability that the lowest of the daily-maximum temperatures at a site in February in any one year is less than zero degrees Celsius. A record of such temperatures in past years could be used to estimate this probability. A model-based alternative would be to select a family of [[probability distributions]] and fit it to the dataset containing past years′ values. The fitted distribution would provide an alternative estimate of the desired probability. This alternative method can provide an estimate of the probability even if all values in the record are greater than zero.

==Mixed nomenclature==
The phrase ''a-posteriori probability'' is also used as an alternative to '''empirical probability''' or relative frequency.&lt;ref name=Mood/&gt; The use of the phrase "a-posteriori" is reminiscent of terms in [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian statistics]], but is not directly related to [[Bayesian inference]], where ''a-posteriori probability'' is occasionally used to refer to [[posterior probability]], which is different even though it has a confusingly similar name.

The term ''a-posteriori probability'', in its meaning as equivalent to '''empirical probability''', may be used in conjunction with ''[[a priori probability]]'' which represents an estimate of a probability not based on any observations, but based an [[deductive reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mood |first=A.

[[File:Sanzio 01 Euclid.jpg|thumb|236px&lt;!--(approx Sidebar/Infobox)--&gt;|Detail from [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]'' featuring a Greek mathematician –&amp;nbsp;perhaps representing [[Euclid]] or [[Archimedes]]&amp;nbsp;– using a [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] to draw a geometric construction.]]
{{General geometry |branches}}

'''Euclidean geometry''' is a mathematical system attributed to [[Alexandria]]n [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Euclid]], which he described in his textbook on [[geometry]]: the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing [[axiom]]s, and deducing many other [[proposition]]s ([[theorem]]s) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians,&lt;ref name = eves1_19&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive [[deductive]] and [[logical system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Elements'' begins with plane geometry, still taught in [[secondary school]] (High School) as the first [[axiomatic system]] and the first examples of [[Mathematical proof|formal proof]]. It goes on to the [[solid geometry]] of [[three dimensions]]. Much of the ''Elements'' states results of what are now called [[algebra]] and [[number theory]], explained in geometrical language.&lt;ref name = eves1_19/&gt;

For more than two thousand years, the adjective "Euclidean" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the [[parallel postulate]]) that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute, often metaphysical, sense. Today, however, many other [[self-consistent]] [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. An implication of [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] is that physical space itself is not Euclidean, and [[Three-dimensional space|Euclidean space]] is a good approximation for it only over short distances (relative to the strength of the  [[gravity|gravitational field]]).&lt;ref&gt;Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973), p.&amp;nbsp;47&lt;/ref&gt;

Euclidean geometry is an example of [[synthetic geometry]], in that it proceeds logically from axioms describing basic properties of geometric objects such as points and lines, to propositions about those objects, all without the use of [[coordinate system|coordinates]] to specify those objects. This is in contrast to [[analytic geometry]], which uses coordinates to translate geometric propositions into algebraic formulas.

==The ''Elements''==
{{main|Euclid's Elements}}
The ''Elements'' is mainly a systematization of earlier knowledge of geometry. Its improvement over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.

There are 13 books in the ''Elements'':

Books I–IV and VI discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, for example "In any triangle two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles." (Book 1 proposition 17 ) and the [[Pythagorean theorem]] "In right angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle." (Book I, proposition 47)

Books V and VII–X deal with [[number theory]], with numbers treated geometrically as lengths of line segments or areas of regions. Notions such as [[prime numbers]] and [[rational number|rational]] and [[irrational number]]s are introduced. It is proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

Books XI–XIII concern [[solid geometry]]. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base. The [[platonic solid]]s are constructed.

===Axioms===
[[File:Parallel postulate en.svg|thumb|The parallel postulate (Postulate 5): If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.]]

Euclidean geometry is an [[axiomatic system]], in which all [[theorems]] ("true statements") are derived from a small number of simple axioms. Until the advent of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], these axioms were considered to be obviously true in the physical world, so that all the theorems would be equally true. However, Euclid's reasoning from assumptions to conclusions remains valid independent of their physical reality.&lt;ref name=Wolfe&gt;The assumptions of Euclid are discussed from a modern perspective in 
{{cite book |title=Introduction to Non-Euclidean Geometry |author=Harold E. Wolfe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPHn3MutWhQC&amp;pg=PA9 |page=9 |isbn=1-4067-1852-1 |year=2007 |publisher=Mill Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Near the beginning of the first book of the ''Elements'', Euclid gives five [[postulate]]s (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions (as translated by Thomas Heath):&lt;ref&gt;tr. Heath, pp. 195–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Let the following be postulated:
# To draw a [[straight line]] from any [[Point (geometry)|point]] to any point.
# To produce [extend] a [[Line segment|finite straight line]] continuously in a straight line."
# To describe a [[circle]] with any centre and distance [radius]."
# "That all [[right angle]]s are equal to one another."
# [The [[parallel postulate]]]: That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than two right angles.

Although Euclid only explicitly asserts the existence of the constructed objects, in his reasoning they are implicitly assumed to be unique.

The ''Elements'' also include the following five "common notions":

# Things that are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another (the [[Transitive property]] of a [[Euclidean relation]]).
# If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal (Addition property of equality).
# If equals are subtracted from equals, then the differences are equal (Subtraction property of equality).
# Things that coincide with one another are equal to one another (Reflexive Property).
# The whole is greater than the part.

===Parallel postulate===
{{main|Parallel postulate}}
To the ancients, the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the others. They aspired to create a system of absolutely certain propositions, and to them it seemed as if the parallel line postulate required proof from simpler statements. It is now known that such a proof is impossible, since one can construct consistent systems of geometry (obeying the other axioms) in which the parallel postulate is true, and others in which it is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=History of the Parallel Postulate|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=27|issue=1|pages=16–23|date=Jan 1920|author=Florence P. Lewis|doi=10.2307/2973238|publisher=The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 27, No. 1|postscript=.|jstor=2973238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the ''Elements'': his first 28 propositions are those that can be proved without it.

Many alternative axioms can be formulated which are [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to the parallel postulate (in the context of the other axioms). For example, [[Playfair's axiom]] states:

:In a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], through a point not on a given straight line, at most one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.

The "at most" clause is all that is needed since it can be proved from the remaining axioms that at least one parallel line exists. 

[[File:euclid-proof.svg|thumb|A proof from Euclid's ''Elements'' that, given a line segment, one may construct an equilateral triangle that includes the segment as one of its sides: an equilateral triangle ΑΒΓ is made by drawing circles Δ and Ε centered on the points Α and Β, and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.]]

==Methods of proof==
Euclidean Geometry is ''[[Constructive proof|constructive]]''. Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 assert the existence and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them with no more than a [[compass and straightedge|compass and an unmarked straightedge]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p.&amp;nbsp;56&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as [[set theory]], which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory.&lt;ref name=set_theory&gt;Within Euclid's assumptions, it is quite easy to give a formula for area of triangles and squares. However, in a more general context like set theory, it is not as easy to prove that the area of a square is the sum of areas of its pieces, for example. See [[Lebesgue measure]] and [[Banach–Tarski paradox]].&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are ''[[Scientific modelling|models]]'' of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects. For example, a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real drawn line will. Though nearly all modern mathematicians consider [[Existence theorem|nonconstructive methods]] just as sound as constructive ones, Euclid's constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones—e.g., some of the Pythagoreans' proofs that involved irrational numbers, which usually required a statement such as "Find the greatest common measure of ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Shanks|title=Solved and Unsolved Problems in Number Theory|year=2002|publisher=American Mathematical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Euclid often used [[proof by contradiction]]. Euclidean geometry also allows the method of superposition, in which a figure is transferred to another point in space. For example, proposition I.4, side-angle-side congruence of triangles, is proved by moving one of the two triangles so that one of its sides coincides with the other triangle's equal side, and then proving that the other sides coincide as well. Some modern treatments add a sixth postulate, the rigidity of the triangle, which can be used as an alternative to superposition.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt;

==System of measurement and arithmetic==
Euclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements: [[angle]] and [[Euclidean distance|distance]]. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the [[right angle]] as his basic unit, so that, e.g., a 45-[[degree (angle)|degree]] angle would be referred to as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line segment with a certain nonzero length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it. Addition of distances is represented by a construction in which one line segment is copied onto the end of another line segment to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.

Measurements of [[area (geometry)|area]] and [[volume]] are derived from distances. For example, a [[rectangle]] with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12. Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, e.g., in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.

[[File:Congruentie.svg|thumb|An example of congruence. The two figures on the left are congruent, while the third is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to them. The last figure is neither. Congruences alter some properties, such as location and orientation, but leave others unchanged, like [[distance]] and [[angle]]s. The latter sort of properties are called [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]s and studying them is the essence of geometry.]]
Euclid refers to a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as "equal" (ἴσος) if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal, and similarly for angles. The stronger term "[[congruence (geometry)|congruent]]" refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure. Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image. Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as [[similarity (geometry)|similar]]. [[corresponding sides and corresponding angles|Corresponding angles]] in a pair of similar shapes are congruent and [[corresponding sides]] are in proportion to each other.

==Notation and terminology==

===Naming of points and figures===
Points are customarily named using capital letters of the alphabet. Other figures, such as lines, triangles, or circles, are named by listing a sufficient number of points to pick them out unambiguously from the relevant figure, e.g., triangle ABC would typically be a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C.

=== Complementary and supplementary angles ===
Angles whose sum is a right angle are called [[Complementary angles|complementary]]. Complementary angles are formed when a ray shares the same vertex and is pointed in a direction that is in between the two original rays that form the right angle. The number of rays in between the two original rays is infinite.

Angles whose sum is a straight angle are [[Supplementary angles|supplementary]]. Supplementary angles are formed when a ray shares the same vertex and is pointed in a direction that is in between the two original rays that form the straight angle (180 degree angle). The number of rays in between the two original rays is infinite.

=== Modern versions of Euclid's notation ===
In modern terminology, angles would normally be measured in [[degree (angle)|degree]]s or [[radian]]s.

Modern school textbooks often define separate figures called [[line (geometry)|line]]s (infinite), [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|rays]] (semi-infinite), and [[line segment]]s (of finite length). Euclid, rather than discussing a ray as an object that extends to infinity in one direction, would normally use locutions such as "if the line is extended to a sufficient length," although he occasionally referred to "infinite lines". A "line" in Euclid could be either straight or curved, and he used the more specific term "straight line" when necessary.

== Some important or well known results ==
&lt;gallery perrow="4"&gt;
File:pons_asinorum_dzmanto.png|The '''[[Pons Asinorum]]''' or '''Bridge of Asses theorem''' states that in an isosceles triangle, α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;β and γ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;δ.
File:Sum_of_angles_of_triangle_dzmanto.png|The '''Triangle Angle Sum theorem''' states that the sum of the three angles of any triangle, in this case angles α, β, and γ, will always equal 180 degrees.
File:Pythagorean.svg|The '''[[Pythagorean theorem]]''' states that the sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs (''a'' and ''b'') of a right triangle equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse (''c'').
File:Thales' Theorem Simple.svg|'''[[Thales' theorem]]''' states that if AC is a diameter, then the angle at B is a right angle.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Pons Asinorum===
The [[Pons Asinorum|Bridge of Asses]] (''Pons Asinorum'') states that ''in isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another.''&lt;ref&gt;Euclid, book I, proposition 5, tr. Heath, p.&amp;nbsp;251&lt;/ref&gt; Its name may be attributed to its frequent role as the first real test in the ''Elements'' of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed. It might also be so named because of the geometrical figure's resemblance to a steep bridge that only a sure-footed donkey could cross.&lt;ref&gt;Ignoring the alleged difficulty of Book I, Proposition 5, [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]] mentions another interpretation. This rests on the resemblance of the figure's lower straight lines to a steeply inclined bridge that could be crossed by an ass but not by a horse: "But there is another view (as I have learnt lately) which is more complimentary to the ass. It is that, the figure of the proposition being like that of a trestle bridge, with a ramp at each end which is more practicable the flatter the figure is drawn, the bridge is such that, while a horse could not surmount the ramp, an ass could; in other words, the term is meant to refer to the sure-footedness of the ass rather than to any want of intelligence on his part." (in "Excursis II," volume 1 of Heath's translation of ''The Thirteen Books of the Elements''.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congruence of triangles===
[[File:Congruent triangles.svg|thumb|right|Congruence of triangles is determined by specifying two sides and the angle between them (SAS), two angles and the side between them (ASA) or two angles and a corresponding adjacent side (AAS). Specifying two sides and an adjacent angle (SSA), however, can yield two distinct possible triangles unless the angle specified is a right angle.]]

Triangles are congruent if they have all three sides equal (SSS), two sides and the angle between them equal (SAS), or two angles and a side equal (ASA) (Book I, propositions 4, 8, and 26). Triangles with three equal angles (AAA) are similar, but not necessarily congruent. Also, triangles with two equal sides and an adjacent angle are not necessarily equal or congruent.

===Triangle angle sum===
The sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to a straight angle (180 degrees).&lt;ref&gt;Euclid, book I, proposition 32&lt;/ref&gt; This causes an equilateral triangle to have three interior angles of 60 degrees. Also, it causes every triangle to have at least two acute angles and up to one [[obtuse angle|obtuse]] or [[right angle]].

===Pythagorean theorem===
The celebrated [[Pythagorean theorem]] (book I, proposition 47) states that in any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).

===Thales' theorem===
[[Thales' theorem]], named after [[Thales of Miletus]] states that if A, B, and C are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle ABC is a right angle. Cantor supposed that Thales proved his theorem by means of Euclid Book I, Prop. 32 after the manner of Euclid Book III, Prop. 31.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, p.&amp;nbsp;135. [https://books.google.com/books?id=drnY3Vjix3kC&amp;pg=PA135 Extract of page 135]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heath, p.&amp;nbsp;318&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scaling of area and volume===
In modern terminology, the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any of its linear dimensions, &lt;math&gt;A \propto L^2&lt;/math&gt;, and the volume of a solid to the cube, &lt;math&gt;V \propto L^3&lt;/math&gt;. Euclid proved these results in various special cases such as the area of a circle&lt;ref&gt;Euclid, book XII, proposition 2&lt;/ref&gt; and the volume of a parallelepipedal solid.&lt;ref&gt;Euclid, book XI, proposition 33&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid determined some, but not all, of the relevant constants of proportionality. E.g., it was his successor [[Archimedes]] who proved that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of the circumscribing cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p.&amp;nbsp;66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}
Because of Euclidean geometry's fundamental status in mathematics, it is impractical to give more than a representative sampling of applications here.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

As suggested by the etymology of the word, one of the earliest reasons for interest in geometry was [[surveying]],&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were used long before they were proved formally.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;5; Mlodinow, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, both of which can be measured directly by a surveyor. Historically, distances were often measured by chains, such as [[Gunter's chain]], and angles using graduated circles and, later, the [[theodolite]].

An application of Euclidean solid geometry is the [[packing problem|determination of packing arrangements]], such as the problem of finding the most efficient [[sphere packing|packing of spheres]] in n dimensions. This problem has applications in [[error detection and correction]].

[[Geometric optics]] uses Euclidean geometry to analyze the focusing of light by lenses and mirrors.

Quite a lot of [[Computer-aided design|CAD (computer-aided design)]] and [[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM (computer-aided manufacturing)]] is based on Euclidean geometry. Design geometry typically consists of shapes bounded by planes, cylinders, cones, tori, etc. CAD/CAM is essential in the design of almost everything, nowadays, including cars, airplanes, ships, and the iPhone. A few decades ago, sophisticated draftsmen learned some fairly advanced Euclidean geometry, including things like Pascal's theorem and Brianchon's theorem. But now they don't have to, because the geometric constructions are all done by CAD programs.

==As a description of the structure of space==
Euclid believed that his [[axioms]] were self-evident statements about physical reality. Euclid's proofs depend upon assumptions perhaps not obvious in Euclid's fundamental axioms,&lt;ref name=Trudeau&gt;{{cite book |title=The Non-Euclidean Revolution|author=Richard J.

As discussed in more detail below, [[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] significantly modifies this view.

The ambiguous character of the axioms as originally formulated by Euclid makes it possible for different commentators to disagree about some of their other implications for the structure of space, such as whether or not it is infinite&lt;ref name="Heath, p.&amp;nbsp;200"&gt;Heath, p.&amp;nbsp;200&lt;/ref&gt; (see below) and what its [[topology]] is. Modern, more rigorous reformulations of the system&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Tarski (1951)&lt;/ref&gt; typically aim for a cleaner separation of these issues. Interpreting Euclid's axioms in the spirit of this more modern approach, axioms 1-4 are consistent with either infinite or finite space (as in [[elliptic geometry]]), and all five axioms are consistent with a variety of topologies (e.g., a plane, a cylinder, or a [[torus]] for two-dimensional Euclidean geometry).

==Later work==

===Archimedes and Apollonius===
[[File:Archimedes sphere and cylinder.svg|thumb|right|A sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder. A sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.]]
[[Archimedes]] (c. 287 BCE – c. 212 BCE), a colorful figure about whom many historical anecdotes are recorded, is remembered along with Euclid as one of the greatest of ancient mathematicians. Although the foundations of his work were put in place by Euclid, his work, unlike Euclid's, is believed to have been entirely original.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, p.&amp;nbsp;27&lt;/ref&gt; He proved equations for the volumes and areas of various figures in two and three dimensions, and enunciated the [[Archimedean property]] of finite numbers.

[[Apollonius of Perga]] (c. 262 BCE – c. 190 BCE) is mainly known for his investigation of conic sections.

[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|left|René Descartes. Portrait after [[Frans Hals]], 1648.]]

===17th century: Descartes===
[[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) developed [[analytic geometry]], an alternative method for formalizing geometry which focused on turning geometry into algebra.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 268ff&lt;/ref&gt;

In this approach, a point on a plane is represented by its [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] (''x'', ''y'') coordinates, a line is represented by its equation, and so on.

In Euclid's original approach, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] follows from Euclid's axioms. In the Cartesian approach, the axioms are the axioms of algebra, and the equation expressing the Pythagorean theorem is then a definition of one of the terms in Euclid's axioms, which are now considered theorems.

The equation
:&lt;math&gt;|PQ|=\sqrt{(p_x-q_x)^2+(p_y-q_y)^2} \, &lt;/math&gt;
defining the distance between two points ''P'' = (''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'') and ''Q'' = (''q&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''q&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'') is then known as the ''Euclidean [[metric space|metric]]'', and other metrics define [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]].

In terms of analytic geometry, the restriction of classical geometry to compass and straightedge constructions means a restriction to first- and second-order equations, e.g., ''y'' = 2''x'' + 1 (a line), or ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 7 (a circle).

Also in the 17th century, [[Girard Desargues]], motivated by the theory of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], introduced the concept of idealized points, lines, and planes at infinity. The result can be considered as a type of generalized geometry, [[projective geometry]], but it can also be used to produce proofs in ordinary Euclidean geometry in which the number of special cases is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Eves (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Squaring the circle.svg|right|thumb|Squaring the circle: the areas of this square and this circle are equal. In 1882, it was proven that this figure cannot be constructed in a finite number of steps with an idealized [[compass and straightedge]].]]

===18th century===
Geometers of the 18th century struggled to define the boundaries of the Euclidean system. Many tried in vain to prove the fifth postulate from the first four. By 1763, at least 28 different proofs had been published, but all were found incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading up to this period, geometers also tried to determine what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of [[trisecting an angle]] with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that can be carried out with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until [[Pierre Wantzel]] published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions that were proved impossible include [[doubling the cube]] and [[squaring the circle]]. In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve equations whose order is an integral power of two,&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 120, Elements of Abstract Algebra, Allan Clark, Dover, {{ISBN|0-486-64725-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.

[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] discussed a generalization of Euclidean geometry called [[affine geometry]], which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four in a way that eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of line segments in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an equivalence relation between lines, and equality of length of parallel line segments (so line segments continue to have a midpoint).

===19th century and non-Euclidean geometry===
In the early 19th century, [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]] and [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]] systematically developed the use of signed angles and line segments as a way of simplifying and unifying results.&lt;ref&gt;Eves (1963), p.&amp;nbsp;64&lt;/ref&gt;

The century's most significant development in geometry occurred when, around 1830, [[János Bolyai]] and [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] separately published work on [[non-Euclidean geometry]], in which the parallel postulate is not valid.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p.&amp;nbsp;485&lt;/ref&gt; Since non-Euclidean geometry is provably relatively consistent with Euclidean geometry, the parallel postulate cannot be proved from the other postulates.

In the 19th century, it was also realized that Euclid's ten axioms and common notions do not suffice to prove all of the theorems stated in the ''Elements''. For example, Euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains at least two points, but this assumption cannot be proved from the other axioms, and therefore must be an axiom itself. The very first geometric proof in the ''Elements,'' shown in the figure above, is that any line segment is part of a triangle; Euclid constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third [[wikt:vertex|vertex]]. His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect, because they do not assert the geometrical property of continuity, which in Cartesian terms is equivalent to the [[Real number#Completeness|completeness]] property of the real numbers. Starting with [[Moritz Pasch]] in 1882, many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been proposed, the best known being those of [[Hilbert's axioms|Hilbert]],&lt;ref&gt;* [[Howard Eves]], 1997 (1958). ''Foundations and Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics''. Dover.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birkhoff's axioms|George Birkhoff]],&lt;ref&gt;Birkhoff, G. D., 1932, "A Set of Postulates for Plane Geometry (Based on Scale and Protractors)," Annals of Mathematics 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tarski's axioms|Tarski]].&lt;ref name="Tarski 1951"&gt;Tarski (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century and general relativity===
[[File:1919 eclipse negative.jpg|thumb|right|A disproof of Euclidean geometry as a description of physical space. In a 1919 test of the general theory of relativity, stars (marked with short horizontal lines) were photographed during a solar [[eclipse]]. The rays of starlight were bent by the Sun's gravity on their way to the earth. This is interpreted as evidence in favor of Einstein's prediction that gravity would cause deviations from Euclidean geometry.]]
[[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[general relativity]] shows that the true geometry of spacetime is not Euclidean geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973), p.&amp;nbsp;191&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do not add up to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now an integral part of the software that runs the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Rizos, Chris. [[University of New South Wales]]. [http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap3/312.htm GPS Satellite Signals]. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to object to this interpretation of general relativity on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can distinguish between a beam of light as a model of a geometrical line and any other physical model. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept non-Euclidean geometry as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.

==Treatment of infinity==

===Infinite objects===
Euclid sometimes distinguished explicitly between "finite lines" (e.g., Postulate 2) and "[[infinity|infinite]] lines" (book I, proposition 12). However, he typically did not make such distinctions unless they were necessary. The postulates do not explicitly refer to infinite lines, although for example some commentators interpret postulate 3, existence of a circle with any radius, as implying that space is infinite.&lt;ref name="Heath, p.&amp;nbsp;200"/&gt;

The notion of [[infinitesimals|infinitesimal quantities]] had previously been discussed extensively by the [[Eleatic School]], but nobody had been able to put them on a firm logical basis, with paradoxes such as [[Zeno's paradox]] occurring that had not been resolved to universal satisfaction. Euclid used the [[method of exhaustion]] rather than infinitesimals.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p.&amp;nbsp;31&lt;/ref&gt;

Later ancient commentators, such as [[Proclus]] (410–485 CE), treated many questions about infinity as issues demanding proof and, e.g., Proclus claimed to prove the infinite divisibility of a line, based on a proof by contradiction in which he considered the cases of even and odd numbers of points constituting it.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, p.&amp;nbsp;268&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, [[Otto Stolz]], [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], [[Giuseppe Veronese]], and others produced controversial work on [[Archimedean property|non-Archimedean]] models of Euclidean geometry, in which the distance between two points may be infinite or infinitesimal, in the [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]–[[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Veronese, On Non-Archimedean Geometry, 1908. English translation in Real Numbers, Generalizations of the Reals, and Theories of Continua, ed. [[Philip Ehrlich]], Kluwer, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty years later, [[Abraham Robinson]] provided a rigorous logical foundation for Veronese's work.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Abraham (1966). Non-standard analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infinite processes===
One reason that the ancients treated the parallel postulate as less certain than the others is that verifying it physically would require us to inspect two lines to check that they never intersected, even at some very distant point, and this inspection could potentially take an infinite amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;For the assertion that this was the historical reason for the ancients considering the parallel postulate less obvious than the others, see Nagel and Newman 1958, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern formulation of [[proof by induction]] was not developed until the 17th century, but some later commentators consider it implicit in some of Euclid's proofs, e.g., the proof of the infinitude of primes.&lt;ref&gt;Cajori (1918), p.&amp;nbsp;197&lt;/ref&gt;

Supposed paradoxes involving infinite series, such as [[Zeno's paradox]], predated Euclid. Euclid avoided such discussions, giving, for example, the expression for the partial sums of the [[geometric series]] in IX.35 without commenting on the possibility of letting the number of terms become infinite.

==Logical basis==

{{See also|Hilbert's axioms|Axiomatic system|Real closed field}}

===Classical logic===
Euclid frequently used the method of [[proof by contradiction]], and therefore the traditional presentation of Euclidean geometry assumes [[classical logic]], in which every proposition is either true or false, i.e., for any proposition P, the proposition "P or not P" is automatically true.

===Modern standards of rigor===
Placing Euclidean geometry on a solid axiomatic basis was a preoccupation of mathematicians for centuries.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;A detailed discussion can be found in {{cite book |title=Methods of geometry |author= James T. Smith |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWpWplOVQ6MC&amp;pg=RA1-PA19 |chapter=Chapter 2: Foundations |pages=19 ''ff'' |isbn=0-471-25183-6 |publisher=Wiley |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of [[primitive notion]]s, or undefined concepts, was clearly put forward by [[Alessandro Padoa]] of the [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] delegation at the 1900 Paris conference:&lt;ref name = Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=revue&gt;{{cite book |title=Revue de métaphysique et de morale, Volume 8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4aoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA592 |page=592 |author=Société française de philosophie |publisher=Hachette |year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{blockquote|text=...when we begin to formulate the theory, we can imagine that the undefined symbols are ''completely devoid of meaning'' and that the unproved propositions are simply ''conditions'' imposed upon the undefined symbols.

That is, mathematics is context-independent knowledge within a hierarchical framework. As said by [[Bertrand Russell]]:&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{cite book |title= The world of mathematics |volume=3 |editor=James Roy Newman |author=Bertrand Russell |chapter=Mathematics and the metaphysicians |isbn=0-486-41151-6 |year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_b2ShqRj8YMC&amp;pg=PA1577 |page=1577 |edition=Reprint of Simon and Schuster 1956 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|text=If our hypothesis is about ''anything'', and not about some one or more particular things, then our deductions constitute mathematics.

Such foundational approaches range between [[foundationalism]] and [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]].

===Axiomatic formulations===
{{blockquote|text=Geometry is the science of correct reasoning on incorrect figures.|source=''How to Solve It'', p.&amp;nbsp;208 |sign=George Polyá}}
*Euclid's axioms: In his dissertation to Trinity College, Cambridge, Bertrand Russell summarized the changing role of Euclid's geometry in the minds of philosophers up to that time.&lt;ref name= Russell&gt;{{cite book |title=An essay on the foundations of geometry |author=Bertrand Russell |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1897 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NecGAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a conflict between certain knowledge, independent of experiment, and empiricism, requiring experimental input.

*[[Hilbert's axioms]]: Hilbert's axioms had the goal of identifying a ''simple'' and ''complete'' set of ''independent'' axioms from which the most important geometric theorems could be deduced.

Pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;) This is equivalent to the decidability of [[real closed fields]], of which elementary Euclidean geometry is a model.

===Constructive approaches and pedagogy===
The process of abstract axiomatization as exemplified by [[Hilbert's axioms]] reduces geometry to theorem proving or [[predicate logic]]. In contrast, the Greeks used construction postulates, and emphasized problem solving.&lt;ref name=Panza&gt;{{cite book |title=Analysis and synthesis in mathematics: history and philosophy |editor1=Michael Otte |editor2=Marco Panza |author=Petri Mäenpää |chapter=From backward reduction to configurational analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFav-N0tv7AC&amp;pg=PA210 |page=210 |isbn=0-7923-4570-3 |year=1999 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Greeks, constructions are more primitive than existence propositions, and can be used to prove existence propositions, but not ''vice versa''. To describe problem solving adequately requires a richer system of logical concepts.&lt;ref name=Panza/&gt; The contrast in approach may be summarized:&lt;ref name=Corsi&gt;{{cite book |title=Deduction, Computation, Experiment: Exploring the Effectiveness of Proof |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVPW-_qsYDgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |page=1 |author=Carlo Cellucci |chapter=Why proof?

*Axiomatic proof: Proofs are deductive derivations of propositions from primitive premises that are ‘true’ in some sense. The aim is to justify the proposition.
*Analytic proof: Proofs are non-deductive derivations of hypotheses from problems. The aim is to find hypotheses capable of giving a solution to the problem. One can argue that Euclid's axioms were arrived upon in this manner. In particular, it is thought that Euclid felt the [[parallel postulate]] was forced upon him, as indicated by his reluctance to make use of it,&lt;ref name=Weisstein0&gt;{{cite book |title=CRC concise encyclopedia of mathematics |author=Eric W.

'''Expensive Desk Calculator''' by [[Robert A. Wagner]] is thought to be [[computing]]'s first interactive calculation program.&lt;ref name="Kotok"&gt;[[Alan Kotok]] (15 May 2006).

Retrieved on 22 June 2006. Kotok's description begins at 1:02.&lt;/ref&gt;

The software first ran on the [[TX-0]] computer loaned to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) by [[Lincoln Laboratory]]. It was ported to the [[PDP-1]] donated to MIT in 1961 by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert M. Slade]] (26 January 1994).

Friends from the MIT [[Tech Model Railroad Club]], Wagner and a group of fellow students had access to these room-sized machines outside classes, signing up for time during off hours. Overseen by [[Jack Dennis]], John McKenzie and faculty advisors, they were [[personal computer]] users as early as the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Kotok" /&gt;

The [[calculators]] Wagner needed to complete his [[numerical analysis]] homework were across campus and in short supply so he wrote one himself. Although the program has about three thousand lines of code and took months to write, Wagner received a grade of zero on his homework. His professor's reaction was, "You used a computer! This ''can't'' be right." [[Steven Levy]] wrote, "The professor would learn in time, as would everyone, that the world opened up by the computer was a limitless one."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Levy (1984).

{{unsolved|mathematics|Are any Fortunate numbers composite? (Fortune's conjecture)}}
A '''Fortunate number''', named after [[Reo Fortune]], is the smallest integer ''m'' &gt; 1 such that, for a given positive [[integer]] ''n'', ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;# + ''m'' is a [[prime number]], where the [[primorial]] ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;# is the product of the first ''n'' prime numbers.

For example, to find the seventh Fortunate number, one would first calculate the product of the first seven primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 and 17), which is 510510. Adding 2 to that gives another even number, while adding 3 would give another multiple of 3. One would similarly rule out the integers up to 18. Adding 19, however, gives 510529, which is prime. Hence 19 is a Fortunate number. The Fortunate number for ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;# is always above ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and all its divisors are larger than ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. This is because ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;#, and thus ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;# + ''m'', is divisible by the [[prime factor]]s of ''m'' not larger than ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The Fortunate numbers for the first primorials are:
:[[3 (number)|3]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[13 (number)|13]], [[23 (number)|23]], [[17 (number)|17]], [[19 (number)|19]], 23, [[37 (number)|37]], [[61 (number)|61]], [[67 (number)|67]], 61, [[71 (number)|71]], [[47 (number)|47]], [[107 (number)|107]], [[59 (number)|59]], 61, [[109 (number)|109]], etc. {{OEIS|id=A005235}}.

The Fortunate numbers sorted in numerical order with duplicates removed:
:3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 23, 37, 47, 59, 61, 67, 71, 79, 89, 101, 103, 107, 109, 127, 151, 157, 163, 167, 191, 197, 199, ... {{OEIS|id=A046066}}.

Reo Fortune conjectured that no Fortunate number is [[Composite number|composite]] (''Fortune's conjecture'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Guy, Richard K.  |title=Unsolved problems in number theory |publisher=Springer |edition=2nd|pages=7–8 |year=1994 |isbn=0-387-94289-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A '''Fortunate prime''' is a Fortunate number which is also a prime number.  {{As of|2012}}, all the known Fortunate numbers are prime.

The '''geometric median''' of a discrete set of sample points in a [[Euclidean space]] is the point minimizing the sum of distances to the sample points. This generalizes the [[median]], which has the property of minimizing the sum of distances for one-dimensional data, and provides a [[central tendency]] in higher dimensions. It is also known as the '''1-median''',&lt;ref&gt;The more general [[k-median problem|''k''-median problem]] asks for the location of ''k'' cluster centers minimizing the sum of distances from each sample point to its nearest center.&lt;/ref&gt; '''spatial median''',&lt;ref name="dksw"/&gt; '''Euclidean minisum point''',&lt;ref name="dksw"&gt;{{harvtxt|Drezner|Klamroth|Schöbel|Wesolowsky|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or '''Torricelli point'''.{{sfnp|Cieslik|2006}}

The geometric median is an important [[estimator]] of [[location parameter|location]] in statistics,{{sfnp|Lawera|Thompson|1993}} where it is also known as the '''''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; estimator'''.&lt;ref name="lr"/&gt; It is also a standard problem in [[facility location]], where it models the problem of locating a facility to minimize the cost of transportation.{{sfnp|Eiselt|Marianov|2011}}

The special case of the problem for three points in the plane (that is, ''m'' = 3 and ''n'' = 2 in the definition below) is sometimes also known as Fermat's problem; it arises in the construction of minimal [[Steiner tree]]s, and was originally posed as a problem by [[Pierre de Fermat]] and solved by [[Evangelista Torricelli]].{{sfnp|Krarup|Vajda|1997}} Its solution is now known as the [[Fermat point]] of the triangle formed by the three sample points.{{sfnp|Spain|1996}} The geometric median may in turn be generalized to the problem of minimizing the sum of ''weighted'' distances, known as the [[Weber problem]] after [[Alfred Weber]]'s discussion of the problem in his 1909 book on facility location.&lt;ref name="dksw"/&gt; Some sources instead call Weber's problem the Fermat–Weber problem,{{sfnp|Brimberg|1995}} but others use this name for the unweighted geometric median problem.{{sfnp|Bose|Maheshwari|Morin|2003}}

{{harvtxt|Wesolowsky|1993}} provides a survey of the geometric median problem. See {{harvtxt|Fekete|Mitchell|Beurer|2005}} for generalizations of the problem to non-discrete point sets.

==Definition==

Formally, for a given set of ''m'' points &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, \dots, x_m\,&lt;/math&gt; with each &lt;math&gt;x_i \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, the geometric median is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\underset{y \in \mathbb{R}^n}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \sum_{i=1}^m \left \| x_i-y \right \|_2&lt;/math&gt;

Here, [[arg min]] means the value of the argument &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; which minimizes the sum. In this case, it is the point &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; from where the sum of all [[Euclidean distance]]s to the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;'s is minimum.

==Properties==
* For the 1-dimensional case, the geometric median coincides with the [[median]]. This is because the [[univariate]] median also minimizes the sum of distances from the points.&lt;ref name="haldane"/&gt;
* The geometric median is '''unique''' whenever the points are not [[Line (geometry)#Collinear points|collinear]].&lt;ref name="vz"&gt;{{harvtxt|Vardi|Zhang|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The geometric median is [[equivariant]] for Euclidean [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity transformations]], including [[translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]].&lt;ref name="lr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haldane"&gt;{{harvtxt|Haldane|1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that one would get the same result either by transforming the geometric median, or by applying the same transformation to the sample data and finding the geometric median of the transformed data. This property follows from the fact that the geometric median is defined only from pairwise distances, and doesn't depend on the system of orthogonal [[Cartesian coordinates]] by which the sample data is represented. In contrast, the component-wise median for a multivariate data set is not in general rotation invariant, nor is it independent of the choice of coordinates.&lt;ref name="lr"/&gt;
* The geometric median has a [[breakdown point]] of 0.5.&lt;ref name="lr"&gt;{{harvtxt|Lopuhaä|Rousseeuw|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, up to half of the sample data may be arbitrarily corrupted, and the median of the samples will still provide a [[robust estimator]] for the location of the uncorrupted data.

==Special cases==
*'''For 3 (non-[[collinear]]) points,''' if any angle of the triangle formed by those points is 120° or more, then the geometric median is the point at the vertex of that angle. If all the angles are less than 120°, the geometric median is the point inside the triangle which subtends an angle of 120° to each three pairs of triangle vertices.&lt;ref name="haldane"/&gt; This is also known as the [[Fermat point]] of the triangle formed by the three vertices. (If the three points are collinear then the geometric median is the point between the two other points, as is the case with a one-dimensional median.)
*'''For 4 [[coplanar]] points,''' if one of the four points is inside the triangle formed by the other three points, then the geometric median is that point. Otherwise, the four points form a convex [[quadrilateral]] and the geometric median is the crossing point of the diagonals of the quadrilateral. The geometric median of four coplanar points is the same as the unique [[Radon point]] of the four points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cieslik|2006}}, p.&amp;nbsp;6; {{harvtxt|Plastria|2006}}. The convex case was originally proven by [[Giovanni Fagnano]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computation==
Despite the geometric median's being an easy-to-understand concept, computing it poses a challenge. The [[centroid]] or [[center of mass]], defined similarly to the geometric median as minimizing the sum of the ''squares'' of the distances to each point, can be found by a simple formula — its coordinates are the averages of the coordinates of the points — but it has been shown that no [[Closed-form expression|explicit formula]], nor an exact algorithm involving only arithmetic operations and ''k''th roots, can exist in general for the geometric median. Therefore, only numerical or symbolic approximations to the solution of this problem are possible under this [[model of computation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bajaj|1986}}; {{harvtxt|Bajaj|1988}}. Earlier, {{harvtxt|Cockayne|Melzak|1969}} proved that the Steiner point for 5 points in the plane cannot be constructed with [[ruler and compass]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is straightforward to calculate an approximation to the geometric median using an iterative procedure in which each step produces a more accurate approximation. Procedures of this type can be derived from the fact that the sum of distances to the sample points is a [[convex function]], since the distance to each sample point is convex and the sum of convex functions remains convex. Therefore, procedures that decrease the sum of distances at each step cannot get trapped in a [[local optimum]].

One common approach of this type, called '''Weiszfeld's algorithm''' after the work of [[Endre Weiszfeld]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Weiszfeld|1937}}; {{harvtxt|Kuhn|1973}}; {{harvtxt|Chandrasekaran|Tamir|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[iteratively re-weighted least squares]]. This algorithm defines a set of weights that are inversely proportional to the distances from the current estimate to the samples, and creates a new estimate that is the weighted average of the samples according to these weights. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\left. y_{i+1}=\left( \sum_{j=1}^m \frac{x_j}{\| x_j - y_i \|} \right) \right/ \left( \sum_{j=1}^m \frac{1}{\| x_j - y_i \|} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
This method converges for almost all initial positions, but may fail to converge when one of its estimates falls on one of the given points. It can be modified to handle these cases so that it converges for all initial points.&lt;ref name="vz"/&gt;

{{harvtxt|Bose|Maheshwari|Morin|2003}} describe more sophisticated geometric optimization procedures for finding approximately optimal solutions to this problem. As {{harvtxt|Nie|Parrilo|Sturmfels|2008}} show, the problem can also be represented as a [[semidefinite programming|semidefinite program]].

{{harvtxt|Cohen|Lee|Miller|Pachocki|2016}} show how to compute the geometric median to arbitrary precision in nearly linear time.

==Characterization of the geometric median==
If ''y'' is distinct from all the given points, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''y'' is the geometric median if and only if it satisfies:
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \sum_{j=1}^m \frac {x_j - y} {\left \| x_j - y \right \|}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;\left. y = \left( \sum_{j=1}^m \frac{x_j}{\| x_j - y \|} \right) \right/ \left( \sum_{j=1}^m \frac{1}{\| x_j - y \|} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

which is closely related to Weiszfeld's algorithm.

In general,  ''y'' is the geometric median if and only if there are vectors ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;0 =  \sum_{j=1}^m u_j &lt;/math&gt;
where for ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ ''y'', 
:&lt;math&gt;u_j = \frac {x_j - y} {\left \| x_j - y \right \|}&lt;/math&gt;
and for ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y'', 
:&lt;math&gt;\| u_j \| \leq 1 .&lt;/math&gt;
An equivalent formulation of this condition is
:&lt;math&gt;\sum _{1\le j\le m, x_j\ne y}
\frac {x_j - y} {\left \| x_j - y \right \|} \le \left|\{
\,j\mid 1\le j\le m, x_j= y\,\}\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen as a generalization of the median property, in the sense that any partition of the points, in particular as induced by any hyperplane through ''y'', has the same and opposite sum of positive ''directions'' from ''y'' on each side. In the one dimensional case, the hyperplane is the point ''y'' itself, and the sum of directions simplifies to the (directed) counting measure.

== Generalizations ==
The geometric median can be generalized from Euclidean spaces to general [[Riemannian manifold]]s (and even [[metric space]]s) using the same idea which is used to define the [[Fréchet mean]] on a Riemannian manifold.{{sfnp|Fletcher|Venkatasubramanian|Joshi|2009}} Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a Riemannian manifold with corresponding distance function &lt;math&gt;d(\cdot, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;w_1, \ldots, w_n&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; weights summing to 1, and let &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt;
be &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; observations from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.  Then we define the  weighted geometric median &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; (or weighted Fréchet median) of the data points as
: &lt;math&gt; m = \underset{x \in M}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i d(x,x_i) &lt;/math&gt;.
If all the weights are equal, we say simply that &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the geometric median.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1968">In [[differential topology]], a mathematical discipline, and more specifically in [[Morse theory]], a '''gradient-like vector field''' is a generalization of [[gradient vector field]].

The primary motivation is as a technical tool in the construction of [[Morse function]]s, to show that one can construct a function whose critical points are at distinct levels. One first constructs a Morse function, then uses gradient-like vector fields to move around the critical points, yielding a different Morse function.

== Definition ==
Given a [[Morse function]] ''f'' on a manifold ''M,'' a gradient-like vector field ''X'' for the function ''f'' is, informally:
* away from critical points, ''X'' points "in the same direction as" the [[gradient]] of ''f,'' and 
* near a critical point (in the neighborhood of a critical point), it equals the gradient of ''f,'' when ''f'' is written in standard form given in the [[Morse lemma]]s.
Formally:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TtKyqozvgIwC&amp;pg=PA63 p. 63]&lt;/ref&gt;
* away from critical points, &lt;math&gt;X \cdot f &gt; 0,&lt;/math&gt;
* around every critical point there is a neighborhood on which ''f'' is given as in the Morse lemmas:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = f(b) - x_1^2 - \cdots - x_{\alpha}^2 + x_{\alpha +1}^2 + \cdots + x_n^2 &lt;/math&gt;
and on which ''X'' equals the gradient of ''f.''

== Dynamical system ==
The associated [[dynamical system]] of a gradient-like vector field, a '''gradient-like dynamical system''', is a special case of a [[Morse–Smale system]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2874">In [[probability theory]], especially as that field is used in [[statistics]], a '''group family''' of [[probability distribution]]s is a family obtained by subjecting a random variable with a fixed distribution to a suitable family of transformations such as a [[location-scale family]], or otherwise a family of probability distributions [[group action|acted upon]] by a [[group (mathematics)|group]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lehmann|first=E. L.|author2=George Casella|title=Theory of Point Estimation|publisher=Springer|date=1998|edition=2nd|isbn=0-387-98502-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consideration of a particular family of distributions as a group family can, in [[statistical theory]], lead to the identification of an [[ancillary statistic]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, D.R. (2006) ''Principles of Statistical Inference'', CUP. {{ISBN|0-521-68567-2}} (Section 4.4.2)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of group families ==
A group family can be generated by subjecting a [[random variable]] with a fixed distribution to some suitable [[Transformation (function)|transformations]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Different types of group families are as follows :

=== Location Family ===

This family is obtained by adding a constant to a [[random variable]]. Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[random variable]] and &lt;math&gt;a \in R&lt;/math&gt; be a constant. Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y = X + a&lt;/math&gt; . Then  &lt;math display="block"&gt;F_Y(y) = P(Y\leq y) = P(X+a \leq y) = P(X \leq y-a) = F_X(y-a)
&lt;/math&gt;For a fixed distribution , as &lt;math&gt;a
&lt;/math&gt; varies from &lt;math&gt;-\infty 
&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty
&lt;/math&gt; , the distributions that we obtain constitute the location family.

=== Scale Family ===

This family is obtained by multiplying a [[random variable]] with a constant. Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[random variable]] and &lt;math&gt;c \in R^+&lt;/math&gt; be a constant. Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y = cX&lt;/math&gt; . Then&lt;math display="block"&gt;F_Y(y) = P(Y\leq y) = P(cX \leq y) = P(X \leq y/c) = F_X(y/c)
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Location - Scale Family ===

This family is obtained by multiplying a [[random variable]] with a constant and then adding some other constant to it. Let &lt;math&gt;X
&lt;/math&gt; be a [[random variable]] , &lt;math&gt;a \in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c \in R^+&lt;/math&gt;be constants. Let &lt;math&gt;Y = cX + a
&lt;/math&gt;. Then 

&lt;math display="block"&gt;F_Y(y) = P(Y\leq y) = P(cX+a \leq y) = P(X \leq (y-a)/c) = F_X((y-a)/c)
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that it is important that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a \in R 
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c \in R^+
&lt;/math&gt; in order to satisfy the properties mentioned in the following section.

== Properties of the transformations ==
The [[Transformation (function)|transformation]] applied to the random variable must satisfy the following properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Closure under composition 
* Closure under inversion

[[File:Hadwiger-Nelson.svg|thumb|240px|A seven-coloring of the plane, and a four-chromatic unit distance graph in the plane (the [[Moser spindle]]), providing that the chromatic number of a plane is bounded above by 7 and below by 4.]]
[[File:GolombGraphProperties.svg|thumb|The [[Golomb graph]], [[Solomon W. Golomb]]'s ten-vertex four-chromatic [[unit distance graph]]]]
In [[geometric graph theory]], the '''Hadwiger–Nelson problem''', named after [[Hugo Hadwiger]] and [[Edward Nelson]], asks for the minimum number of colors required to color the [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] such that no two [[Point (geometry)|points]] at distance 1 from each other have the same color. The answer is unknown, but has been narrowed down to one of the numbers 5, 6 or 7. The correct value may depend on the choice of axioms for [[set theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, pp. 557–563; {{harvtxt|Shelah|Soifer|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to finite graphs==
The question can be phrased in [[Graph theory|graph theoretic]] terms as follows. Let ''G'' be the [[unit distance graph]] of the plane: an infinite graph with all points of the plane as [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] and with an edge between two vertices if and only if the distance between the two points is 1. The Hadwiger–Nelson problem is to find the [[chromatic number]] of ''G''. As a consequence, the problem is often called "finding the chromatic number of the plane". By the [[De Bruijn–Erdős theorem (graph theory)|de Bruijn–Erdős theorem]], a result of {{harvtxt|de Bruijn|Erdős|1951}}, the problem is equivalent (under the assumption of the [[axiom of choice]]) to that of finding the largest possible chromatic number of a finite unit distance graph.

==History==
According to {{harvtxt|Jensen|Toft|1995}}, the problem was first formulated by E. Nelson in 1950, and first published by {{harvtxt|Gardner|1960}}. {{harvtxt|Hadwiger|1945}} had earlier published a related result, showing that any cover of the plane by five congruent closed sets contains a unit distance in one of the sets, and he also mentioned the problem in a later paper {{harv|Hadwiger|1961}}.  {{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}} discusses the problem and its history extensively.

==Lower and upper bounds==
The fact that the chromatic number of the plane must be at least four follows from the existence of a seven-vertex unit distance graph with chromatic number four, named the [[Moser spindle]] after its discovery in 1961 by the brothers William and [[Leo Moser]]. This graph consists of two unit [[equilateral triangle]]s joined at a common vertex&amp;ndash;''x''. Each of these triangles is joined along another edge to another equilateral triangle; the vertices ''y'' and ''z'' of these joined triangles are at unit distance from each other. If the plane could be three-colored, the coloring within the triangles would force ''y'' and ''z'' to both have the same color as ''x'', but then, since ''y'' and ''z'' are at unit distance from each other, we would not have a proper coloring of the unit distance graph of the plane. Therefore, at least four colors are needed to color this graph and the plane containing it. An alternative lower bound in the form of a ten-vertex four-chromatic unit distance graph, the [[Golomb graph]], was discovered at around the same time by [[Solomon W. Golomb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, biologist [[Aubrey de Grey]] found a 1581-vertex, non-4-colourable unit-distance graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Kalai linked additional posts by [[Jordan Ellenberg]] and [[Noam Elkies]], with Elkies and (separately) de Grey proposing a [[Polymath project]] to find non-4-colorable unit distance graphs with fewer vertices than the one in de Grey's construction. The smallest known graph with chromatic number 5 has 553 vertices {{harvtxt|Heule|2018}}. The page of the Polymath project, {{harvtxt|Polymath|2018}}, contains further research and media citations and verification data.

The upper bound of seven on the chromatic number follows from the existence of a [[tessellation]] of the plane by regular hexagons, with diameter slightly less than one, that can be assigned seven colors in a repeating pattern to form a 7-coloring of the plane. According to {{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, this upper bound was first observed by [[John R. Isbell]].

==Variations of the problem==
The problem can easily be extended to higher dimensions. In particular, finding the chromatic number of space usually refers to the 3-dimensional version. As with the version on the plane, the answer is not known, but has been shown to be at least 6 and at most 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Coulson|2002}}; {{harvtxt|Radoičić|Tóth|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the n-dimensional case of the problem, an easy upper bound on the number of required colorings found from tiling n-dimensional cubes is &lt;math&gt;\lfloor2+\sqrt{n}\rfloor^n&lt;/math&gt;. A lower bound from simplexes is &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, a lower bound of &lt;math&gt;n+2&lt;/math&gt; is available using a generalization of the Moser spindle: a pair of the objects (each 2 simplexes glued together on a facet) which are joined on 1 side by a point and the other side by a line.

One can also consider colorings of the plane in which the sets of points of each color are restricted to sets of some particular type.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{harvtxt|Croft|Falconer|Guy|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such restrictions may cause the required number of colors to increase, as they prevent certain colorings from being considered acceptable. For instance, if a coloring of the plane consists of regions bounded by [[Jordan curve]]s, then at least six colors are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Woodall|1973}}; see also {{harvtxt|Coulson|2004}} for a different proof of a similar result.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12440">In [[recursion theory]], '''hyperarithmetic theory''' is a generalization of [[Computable function|Turing computability]].  It has close connections with definability in [[second-order arithmetic]] and with weak systems of [[set theory]] such as [[Kripke–Platek set theory]].  It is an important tool in [[effective descriptive set theory]].

The central focus of hyperarithmetic theory is the sets of [[natural number]]s known as '''hyperarithmetic sets'''.  There are three equivalent ways of defining this class of sets; the study of the relationships between these different definitions is one motivation for the study of hyperarithmetical theory.

== Hyperarithmetical sets and definability ==

The first definition of the hyperarithmetic sets uses the [[analytical hierarchy]]. 
A set of natural numbers is classified at level &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_1&lt;/math&gt; of this hierarchy if it is definable by a formula of [[second-order arithmetic]] with only existential set quantifiers and no other set quantifiers.  A set is classified at level &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; of the analytical hierarchy if it is definable by a formula of second-order arithmetic with only universal set quantifiers and no other set quantifiers.  A set is &lt;math&gt;\Delta^1_1&lt;/math&gt; if it is both &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt;.  The hyperarithmetical sets are exactly the &lt;math&gt;\Delta^1_1&lt;/math&gt; sets.

== Hyperarithmetical sets and iterated Turing jumps: the hyperarithmetical hierarchy==

The definition of hyperarithmetical sets as &lt;math&gt;\Delta^1_1&lt;/math&gt; does not directly depend on computability results.  A second, equivalent, definition shows that the hyperarithmetical sets can be defined using infinitely iterated [[Turing jump]]s.  This second definition also shows that the hyperarithmetical sets can be classified into a hierarchy extending the [[arithmetical hierarchy]]; the hyperarithmetical sets are exactly the sets that are assigned a rank in this hierarchy.

Each level of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy corresponds to a countable [[ordinal number]] (ordinal), but not all countable ordinals correspond to a level of the hierarchy. The ordinals used by the hierarchy are those with an '''[[ordinal notation]]''', which is a concrete, effective description of the ordinal.

An ordinal notation is an effective description of a countable ordinal by a natural number. A system of ordinal notations is required in order to define the hyperarithmetic hierarchy. The fundamental property an ordinal notation must have is that it describes the ordinal in terms of small ordinals in an effective way. The following inductive definition is typical; it uses a [[pairing function]] &lt;math&gt;\langle \cdot , \cdot\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.
* The number 0 is a notation for the ordinal 0.
* If ''n'' is a notation for an ordinal &amp;lambda; then &lt;math&gt;\langle 1, n \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a notation for &amp;lambda; + 1;
* Suppose that &amp;delta; is a limit ordinal. A notation for &amp;delta; is a number of the form &lt;math&gt;\langle 2, e\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where ''e'' is the index of a total computable function &lt;math&gt;\phi_e&lt;/math&gt; such that for each ''n'', &lt;math&gt;\phi_e(n)&lt;/math&gt; is a notation for an ordinal &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; less than &amp;delta; and &amp;delta; is the [[supremum|sup]] of the set &lt;math&gt;\{ \lambda_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;.

There are only countably many ordinal notations, since each notation is a natural number; thus there is a countable ordinal which is the supremum of all ordinals that have a notation. This ordinal is known as the [[Large countable ordinal#The Church–Kleene ordinal|Church-Kleene ordinal]] and is denoted &lt;math&gt;\omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that this ordinal is still countable, the symbol being only an analogy with the first uncountable ordinal, &lt;math&gt;\omega_{1}&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of all natural numbers that are ordinal notations is denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; and called ''Kleene's &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;''.

Ordinal notations are used to define iterated Turing jumps. These are sets of natural numbers denoted &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt; \omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &amp;delta; has notation ''e''. The set &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; is defined using ''e'' as follows.
* If &amp;delta; = 0 then &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}= 0&lt;/math&gt; is the empty set. 
* If &amp;delta; = &amp;lambda; + 1 then &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; is the Turing jump of &lt;math&gt;0^{(\lambda)}&lt;/math&gt;. The notations &lt;math&gt;0'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0''&lt;/math&gt; are commonly used for &lt;math&gt;0^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. 
* If &amp;delta; is a limit ordinal, let &lt;math&gt;\langle \lambda_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be the sequence of ordinals less than &amp;delta; given by the notation ''e''. The set &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; is given by the rule &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)} = \{ \langle n,i\rangle \mid i \in 0^{(\lambda_n)}\}&lt;/math&gt;. This is the [[effective join]] of the sets &lt;math&gt;0^{(\lambda_n)}&lt;/math&gt;.
Although the construction of &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; depends on having a fixed notation for &amp;delta;, and each infinite ordinal has many notations, a theorem of Spector shows that the [[Turing degree]] of &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; depends only on &amp;delta;, not on the particular notation used, and thus &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; is well defined up to Turing degree.

The hyperarithmetical hierarchy is defined from these iterated Turing jumps. A set ''X'' of natural numbers is classified at level &amp;delta; of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy, for &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt; \omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt;, if ''X'' is [[Turing reduction|Turing reducible]] to &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt;. There will always be a least such &amp;delta; if there is any; it is this least &amp;delta; that measures the level of uncomputability of ''X''.

== Hyperarithmetical sets and recursion in higher types ==

A third characterization of the hyperarithmetical sets, due to Kleene, uses [[type theory|higher-type]] computable functionals. The type-2 functional &lt;math&gt;{}^2E\colon \mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}} \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the following rules:
:&lt;math&gt;{}^2E(f) = 1 \quad&lt;/math&gt; if there is an ''i'' such that ''f''(''i'') &gt; 0,
:&lt;math&gt;{}^2E(f) = 0 \quad&lt;/math&gt; if there is no ''i'' such that ''f''(''i'') &gt; 0.
Using a precise definition of computability relative to a type-2 functional, Kleene showed that a set of natural numbers is hyperarithmetical if and only if it is computable relative to &lt;math&gt;{}^2E&lt;/math&gt;.

== Example: the truth set of arithmetic ==

Every [[arithmetical set]] is hyperarithmetical, but there are many other hyperarithmetical sets. One example of a hyperarithmetical, nonarithmetical set is the set ''T'' of Gödel numbers of formulas of [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]] that are true in the standard natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. The set ''T'' is [[Turing reduction|Turing equivalent]] to the set &lt;math&gt;0^{(\omega)}&lt;/math&gt;, and so is not high in the hyperarithmetical hierarchy, although it is not arithmetically definable by [[Tarski's indefinability theorem]].

== Fundamental results ==

The fundamental results of hyperarithmetic theory show that the three definitions above define the same collection of sets of natural numbers. These equivalences are due to Kleene.

Completeness results are also fundamental to the theory. A set of natural numbers is '''&lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; complete''' if it is at level &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; of the [[analytical hierarchy]] and every &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; set of natural numbers is [[many-one reduction|many-one reducible]] to it. The definition of a &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; complete subset of Baire space (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;) is similar.   Several sets associated with hyperarithmetic theory are &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; complete:
* Kleene's &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;, the set of natural numbers that are notations for ordinal numbers
* The set of natural numbers ''e'' such that the computable function &lt;math&gt;\phi_e(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; computes the characteristic function of a well ordering of the natural numbers. These are the indices of [[recursive ordinal]]s.
* The set of elements of Baire space that are the characteristic functions of a well ordering of the natural numbers (using an effective isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N} \cong \mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}})&lt;/math&gt;.

Results known as '''&lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_1&lt;/math&gt; bounding''' follow from these completeness results.  For any &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_1&lt;/math&gt; set ''S'' of ordinal notations, there is an &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt; such that every element of ''S'' is a notation for an ordinal less than &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  For any subset ''T'' of Baire space consisting only of characteristic functions of well orderings, there is an &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt; such that each ordinal represented in ''T'' is less than &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

== Relativized hyperarithmeticity and hyperdegrees ==

The definition of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; can be relativized to a set ''X'' of natural numbers: in the definition of an ordinal notation, the clause for limit ordinals is changed so that the computable enumeration of a sequence of ordinal notations is allowed to use ''X'' as an oracle. The set of numbers that are ordinal notations relative to ''X'' is denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}^X&lt;/math&gt;. The supremum of ordinals represented in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}^X&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;\omega^{X}_1&lt;/math&gt;; this is a countable ordinal no smaller than &lt;math&gt;\omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

The definition of &lt;math&gt;0^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt; can also be relativized to an arbitrary set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of natural numbers. The only change in the definition is that &lt;math&gt;X^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be ''X'' rather than the empty set, so that &lt;math&gt;X^{(1)} = X'&lt;/math&gt; is the Turing jump of ''X'', and so on.  Rather than terminating at &lt;math&gt;\omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt; the hierarchy relative to ''X'' runs through all ordinals less than &lt;math&gt;\omega^{X}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

The relativized hyperarithmetical hierarchy is used to define '''hyperarithmetical reducibility'''. Given sets ''X'' and ''Y'', we say &lt;math&gt; X \leq_{HYP} Y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is a &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt; \omega^Y_1&lt;/math&gt; such that ''X'' is Turing reducible to &lt;math&gt;Y^{(\delta)}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt; X \leq_{HYP} Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Y \leq_{HYP} X&lt;/math&gt; then the notation &lt;math&gt; X \equiv_{HYP} Y&lt;/math&gt; is used to indicate ''X'' and ''Y'' are '''hyperarithmetically equivalent'''.  This is a coarser equivalence relation than [[Turing reduction|Turing equivalence]]; for example, every set of natural numbers is hyperarithmetically equivalent to its [[Turing jump]] but not Turing equivalent to its Turing jump.  The equivalence classes of hyperarithmetical equivalence are known as '''hyperdegrees'''.

The function that takes a set ''X'' to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}^X&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''hyperjump''' by analogy with the Turing jump. Many properties of the hyperjump and hyperdegrees have been established.  In particular, it is known that [[Turing degree#Post.27s problem and the priority method|Post's problem]] for hyperdegrees has a positive answer: for every set ''X''  of natural numbers there is a set ''Y'' of natural numbers such that &lt;math&gt;X &lt;_{HYP} Y &lt;_{HYP} \mathcal{O}^X&lt;/math&gt;.

== Generalizations ==

Hyperarithmetical theory is generalized by [[Alpha recursion theory|&amp;alpha;-recursion theory]], which is the study of definable subsets of [[admissible ordinal]]s. Hyperarithmetical theory is the special case in which &amp;alpha; is &lt;math&gt;\omega^{CK}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5065">In [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] and [[graph theory]], '''induced subgraph isomorphism''' is an [[NP-complete]] [[decision problem]] that involves finding a given graph as an [[induced subgraph]] of a larger graph.

==Problem statement==
Formally, the problem takes as input two [[graph theory|graph]]s ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=(''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=(''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), where the number of vertices in ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be assumed to be less than or equal to the number of vertices in ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to an induced subgraph of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if there is an [[injective function]] ''f'' which maps the vertices of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to vertices of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such that for all pairs of vertices ''x'', ''y'' in ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, edge (''x'', ''y'') is in ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if the edge (''f''(''x''), ''f''(''y'')) is in ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The answer to the decision problem is yes if this function ''f'' exists, and no otherwise.

This is different from the [[subgraph isomorphism problem]] in that the absence of an edge in ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; implies that the corresponding edge in ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must also be absent.  In subgraph isomorphism, these "extra" edges in ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be present.

==Computational complexity==
The complexity of induced subgraph isomorphism separates [[outerplanar graph]]s from their generalization [[series-parallel graph]]s: it may be solved in [[polynomial time]] for [[k-vertex-connected graph|2-connected]] outerplanar graphs, but is NP-complete for 2-connected series-parallel graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Special cases==
The special case of finding a long [[path (graph theory)|path]] as an induced subgraph of a [[hypercube graph|hypercube]] has been particularly well-studied, and is called the [[snake-in-the-box]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | year = 1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[maximum independent set problem]] is also an induced subgraph isomorphism problem in which one seeks to find a large [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] as an induced subgraph of a larger graph, and the [[maximum clique problem]] is an induced subgraph isomorphism problem in which one seeks to find a large [[clique (graph theory)|clique graph]] as an induced subgraph of a larger graph.

==Differences with the subgraph isomorphism problem==

Although the induced subgraph isomorphism problem seems only slightly different from the subgraph isomorphism problem, the "induced" restriction introduces changes large enough that we can witness differences from a computational complexity point of view. 

For example, the subgraph isomorphism problem is NP-complete on connected proper interval graphs and on connected bipartite permutation graphs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kijima|first=Shuji|author2=Otachi, Yota |author3=Saitoh, Toshiki |author4= Uno, Takeaki |title=Subgraph isomorphism in graph classes|journal=Discrete Mathematics|date=1 November 2012|volume=312|issue=21|pages=3164–3173|doi=10.1016/j.disc.2012.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the '''induced''' subgraph isomorphism problem can be solved in polynomial time on these two classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heggernes|first1=Pinar|author1-link=Pinar Heggernes|last2=van 't Hof|first2=Pim|last3=Meister|first3=Daniel|last4=Villanger|first4=Yngve|title=Induced subgraph isomorphism on proper interval and bipartite permutation graphs|journal=submitted|url=http://www.ii.uib.no/~pinar/isi_journal_revised2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the induced subtree isomorphism problem (i.e. the induced subgraph isomorphism problem where ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is restricted to be a tree) can be solved in polynomial time on interval graphs, while the subtree isomorphism problem is NP-complete on proper interval graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heggernes|first1=Pinar|author1-link=Pinar Heggernes|last2=van 't Hof|first2=Pim|last3=Milanič|first3=Martin|title=Induced Subtrees in Interval Graphs|journal=Proceedings of the 24th International Workshop on Combinatorial Algorithms (IWOCA)|year=2013|volume=To appear|url=http://www.ii.uib.no/~pinar/subtrees.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Society for Computational Biology Student Council''' (ISCB-SC) is a dedicated section of the [[International Society for Computational Biology]] created in 2004. It is composed by students from all levels ([[Undergraduate degree|undergraduates]], [[Postgraduate education|postgraduates]], and [[postdoctoral researcher]]s) in the fields of [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]]. The organisation promotes the development of the students' community worldwide by organizing different events including [[Academic conference|symposia]], [[workshop]]s, [[webinar]]s, [[internship]] coordination and [[hackathon]]s. A special focus is made on the development of [[soft skills]] in order to develop potential in bioinformatics and computational biology students around the world.

The ISCB-SC is composed of Regional Student Groups (RSGs) which are located in various regions across the [[globe]]. Since its foundation, the ISCB-SC has gained representation in most continents through over thirty RSGs which collectively represent more than 1,000 students and researchers around the world.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== History ==
The ISCB Student Council was officially established in 2004 by a vote from the ISCB Board of Directors at the [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology|ISMB]]/[[European Conference on Computational Biology|ECCB]] meeting. The concept of the student council was first proposed by [[Manuel Corpas (Scientist)|Manuel Corpas]] in late 2003. The establishment of the student council was the first move of the ISCB to include the new generation of computational biologists into the, then newly emerging, field.&lt;ref name="ISCBHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the ISCB|url=http://www.iscb.org/iscb-history|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="first-exec-cmte"&gt;{{cite web|title=ISCB Newsletter 7-3|url=https://www.iscb.org/images/stories/newsletter/newsletter7-3/council.html|website=www.iscb.org|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meeting had about 30 students and eight members of the ISCB leadership at the [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology]] (ISMB) 2005 in Detroit, Michigan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corpas|first1=Manuel|title=Graduate students band together to foster communication|journal=Nature|date=24 August 2005|volume=436|issue=1204|doi=10.1038/nj7054-1204b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first official Student Council Symposium (SCS) was held later that year at the [[European Conference on Computational Biology]] (ECCB) meeting in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. The first SCS had approximately 100 attendees and was the beginning of a long-running series of meetings organized and highlighting students.&lt;ref name="ISCBHistory" /&gt; Other than the first instance of SCS, all later editions have as a satellite meeting of ISMB. In 2012, the SC started a second set of symposia that takes place at ECCB when it is not co-located with ISMB; the European Student Council Symposium (ESCS) regularly has more attendees than SCS when both events are held in the same year. Recently, the SC symposia have also been held along with other ISCB conferences like the case for the Latin American Student Council Symposium (LA-SCS) which is held every two years along with the Latin American ISCB Conference since 2014 &lt;ref name=Parra2015&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parra RG, Simonetti FL, Hasenahuer MA, Olguin-Orellana G, Shanmugam AK | title=Highlights from the 1st ISCB Latin American Student Council Symposium 2014. | pmc=4423572 |journal= BMC Bioinformatics |year=2015 |pmid=25955751 |volume=16 Suppl 8 |page=A1 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-16-s8-a1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the ISCB Student Council Symposium in Africa (SCS-Africa) which is held along the ISCB Africa ASBCB conference since 2015.&lt;ref name=Souilmi2015&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Souilmi Y, Allali I, Badad O, Dwibedi CK | title= Highlights of the first ISCB Student Council Symposium in Africa 2015 | url= https://f1000research.com/articles/4-569/v1 |journal= F1000Res. |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional student groups==
In 2006, the student council created the Regional Student Group (RSG) initiative to tailor the efforts of the council for the local community.&lt;ref name="rsg_page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsg.iscbsc.org|title=ISCB-SC RSGs|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macintyre|first=Geoff|year=2013|title=The Regional Student Group Program of the ISCB Student Council: Stories from the Road|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003241}}&lt;/ref&gt; RSGs are locally managed groups established at various regions. Each RSG operates either under the aegis of a [[higher education]] institution or as an independent organisation sub-affiliated to local computational biology or bioinformatics organisation. RSGs are provided support from both the student council and other local groups in their region and often organize multi-RSG events such as BeNeLuxFra. {{As of|2017}}, the global network of the student council includes over 25 active RSGs operating across five continents.

The RSG committee was set up in 2008 to oversee and coordinates the activities of RSGs across the world. The team comprises an RSG-Chair, a co-chair and five vice-chairs corresponding to geographical regions (Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Latin America and USA-Canada). The RSG chair is required to have previous experience as a president or secretary of an RSG. Currently, around 2,000 students and researchers are active members of RSG-related events.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The ISCB-SC continuously looks for PhD students or postdocs who may be interested in starting a new RSG in a region where the student council has no presence yet. The student council also supports existing RSGs by advising them on how to grow, in terms of the events and projects they face as well as economically. There are 3 funding calls every year where RSGs can submit proposals containing different types of events which will be evaluated by the continental RSG chairs and the Executive Committee. Since the creation of the Student Council ''[[Faculty of 1000|F1000Research]]'' channel&lt;ref name="f1000res-sc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Articles from channel ISCB Student Council - F1000Research|url=https://f1000research.com/channels/studentcouncil|website=f1000research.com|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016, achievements by RSGs throughout each year are discussed in editorial articles.&lt;ref name=Shome2016&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shome Sayane |author2=Meysman Pieter |author3=Parra R. Gonzalo |author4=Monzon Alexander Miguel |author5=Palopoli Nicolas |author6=White Benjamen |author7=Rahman Farzana |author8=Hassan Mehedi |author9=Ozkeserli Zeynep |author10=Ashano Efejiro |author11=Hughitt V.

The ISCB-SC runs an internship program in which researchers throughout the world can offer a place for a student from a developing nation to join his/her group for a period of time. This program aims to give students from developing nations the opportunity to have an experience in a working environment from first class research groups and interact with expert Principal Investigators around the world.&lt;ref name="intern"&gt;{{cite web|title=Internship Program {{!}} ISCB Student Council|url=http://www.iscbsc.org/content/internships-0|website=www.iscbsc.org|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Press ==
As a worldwide organization, the SC organizes symposia, workshops and different events across the globe. After more than ten years of existence, many new experiences have been gained on how to deal with different obstacles that arise when trying to tackle complex objectives. Learning experiences are published as articles that aim to help new RSGs, as well as other student organizations, including bioinformatics communities, to organize their own events and strengthen their growth.

Since its conception, the ISCB Student Council has not only advocated for the students in the [[ISCB]] and beyond&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISCB-SC Stands with all Scientists|url=http://iscbsc.org/iscbsc_stands_with_scientists|date=Feb 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, also, the SC has made lots of efforts to help educate new students.

In 2014, the ISCB Student Council began publishing a collection of articles in the ''[[PLOS]]'' journals that covers details about the development of the SC and how to advance in the field.&lt;ref name="PLoS_Articles"&gt;{{cite web|title=PLoS Collections|url=http://collections.plos.org/iscb-student-council}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a collective effort because of reaching a decade of story, different Student Council leaders from different regions in the world, came together and published 12 articles as part of the "Stories from the road: ISCB Student Council Collection" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stories from the road: SCB Student Council Collection|url=http://collections.plos.org/iscb-student-council}}&lt;/ref&gt; that summarize the experience and lessons that were learned through those years. These articles range in topic from starting and expanding your scientific network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Breaking the Ice and Forging Links: The Importance of Socializing in Research|first1=Miranda|last1=Stobbe|first2=et|last2=al.|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003355|date=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Establishing and Managing a Global Student Network|first1=Avinash|last1=Shanmugam|first2=Geoff|last2=Macintyre|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003920|date=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with the frustration of failure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title= The Upside of Failure: How Regional Student Groups Learn from Their Mistakes|first1=Tarum|last1=Mishra|first2=R. Gonzalo|last2=Parra | first3=Thomas|last3=Abeel|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003768|date=August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to disseminating science to the public. In particular, the article "Explain Bioinformatics to Your Grandmother!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Explain Bioinformatics to Your Grandmother!|first1=Virginie|last1=Bernard|first2=Magali|last2=Michaut|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003305|date=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aims to simplify the answer to the question "What is bioinformatics?" to non-scientists, has accumulated more than 17,000 views (as of 2017) and constitutes one of the most read articles in ''[[PLOS Computational Biology]]''.

The Student Council also has its own article channel on ''F1000Research'' which features publications highlighting the activities of the council.&lt;ref name="f1000res-sc" /&gt;

In addition to the collections in F1000 and PLOS, the Student Council has publications that have appeared in ''[[BMC Bioinformatics]]'' and other journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Publications|url=http://iscbsc.org/content/publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
The student council organizes several symposia each year to coincide with the major [[ISCB]] Conferences&lt;ref&gt;[http://iscbsc.org/scs-previous-symposiums Previous ISCB-SC Symposia]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Student Council Symposium (SCS) is held each year directly preceding ISMB (or ISMB/ECCB). The symposium has been organised each year since 2005.
* The European Student Council Symposium (ESCS) is a biennial symposium that takes place preceding the ECCB (when ECCB is not co-located with ISMB). It has been held since 2010.
* The Latin American Student Council Symposium (LA-SCS) is held in even-numbered years directly preceding [[ISCB-LA]]. The LA-SCS has been held every other year since 2014.
* The African Student Council Symposium (SCS Africa) is held preceding the [[ISCB Africa ASBCB Conference on Bioinformatics]] since 2015.

In addition to the main ISCB-SC events that accompany the main ISCB conference(s), RSGs also hold events on a regular basis;&lt;ref name="rsg-events"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Regional Student Groups in 2016 {{!}} ISCB Student Council|url=http://iscbsc.org/node/196|website=iscbsc.org|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; these include annual events in Argentina,&lt;ref name="Parra2016" /&gt; Germany&lt;ref name="germany-symp"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ibn-Salem|first1=Jonas|last2=Meiers|first2=Sascha|last3=Eigenbrod|first3=Ole|last4=Sehlke|first4=Robert|last5=Talyan|first5=Sweta|last6=Schwahn|first6=Kevin|last7=Otto|first7=Raik|last8=Pataskar|first8=Abhijeet|last9=Metge|first9=Franziska|last10=Angerer|first10=Philipp|title=Highlights of the 1st Student Symposium on Computational Genomics|url=https://genomicscomputbiol.org/ojs/index.php/GCB/article/view/59|website=Genomics and Computational Biology|accessdate=21 May 2017|pages=59|language=en|doi=10.18547/gcb.2016.vol2.iss1.e59|date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Farzana|last2=Farmer|first2=Rohit|last3=Das|first3=Sayoni|last4=Vayani|first4=Fatima|last5=Hassan|first5=Mehedi|date=2015-06-16|title=Highlights of the 1st Student Symposium of the ISCB RSG UK|url=http://f1000research.com/articles/4-154/v1|journal=F1000Research|volume=4|doi=10.12688/f1000research.6616.1|pmc=4786907|pmid=26998223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Benjamen|last2=Fatima|first2=Vayani|last3=Fatima|first3=Nazeefa|last4=Das|first4=Sayoni|last5=Rahman|first5=Farzana|last6=Hassan|first6=Mehedi|date=2016-05-17|title=Highlights of the 2nd Bioinformatics Student Symposium by ISCB RSG-UK|url=http://f1000research.com/articles/5-902/v1|journal=F1000Research|volume=5|doi=10.12688/f1000research.8445.1|pmc=4870987|pmid=27239284|page=902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Committees ==
Every year, ISCB and SC members elect new leadership positions. The positions are filled by students and/or postdoctoral members of the SC. The key mission of the SC's Executive Team is to lead the sustainable development of the organisation and its RSGs, and managing the coordination of all activities.

In addition, the SC aims to coordinate and integrate efforts of all members and volunteers who contribute their time. For the purpose of better organizational structure, the SC has established several committees that are chaired by SC members and managed by the executive team. Below is the list of the SC's committee's with description of each committee's responsibilities:

In mathematics, a '''Lagrangian system''' is a pair {{math|(''Y'', ''L'')}}, consisting of a smooth [[fiber bundle]] {{math|''Y'' → ''X''}} and a Lagrangian density {{math|''L''}}, which yields the Euler–Lagrange [[differential operator]] acting on sections of {{math|''Y'' → ''X}}.

In [[classical mechanics]], many [[dynamical system]]s are Lagrangian systems. The configuration space of such a Lagrangian system is a fiber bundle {{math|''Q'' → ℝ}} over the time axis {{math|ℝ}}. In particular, {{math|''Q'' {{=}} ℝ × ''M''}} if a reference frame is fixed. In [[classical field theory]], all field systems are the Lagrangian ones.

== Lagrangians and Euler–Lagrange operators ==
A '''Lagrangian density''' {{math|''L''}} (or, simply, a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]) of order {{math|''r''}} is defined as an [[exterior form|{{math|''n''}}-form]], {{math|1=''n'' = dim ''X''}}, on the {{math|''r''}}-order [[jet bundle|jet manifold]] {{math|''J''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;''Y''}} of {{math|''Y''}}.

A Lagrangian {{math|''L''}} can be introduced as an element of the [[variational bicomplex]] of the [[differential graded algebra]] {{math|''O''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')}} of [[differential form|exterior forms]] on [[jet bundle|jet manifolds]] of {{math|''Y'' → ''X''}}. The [[cohomology|coboundary operator]] of this bicomplex contains the variational operator {{math|''δ''}} which, acting on {{math|''L''}}, defines the associated Euler–Lagrange operator {{math|''δL''}}.

=== In coordinates ===
Given bundle coordinates {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''λ''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}} on a fiber bundle {{math|''Y''}} and the adapted coordinates {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''λ''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|1=(Λ = (''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, {{math|1={{!}}Λ{{!}} = ''k'' ≤ ''r''}}) on jet manifolds {{math|''J''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;''Y''}}, a Lagrangian {{math|''L''}} and its Euler–Lagrange operator read

: &lt;math&gt;L=\mathcal{L}(x^\lambda,y^i,y^i_\Lambda) \, d^nx,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\delta L= \delta_i\mathcal{L} \, dy^i\wedge d^nx,\qquad \delta_i\mathcal{L} =\partial_i\mathcal{L} +
\sum_{|\Lambda|}(-1)^{|\Lambda|} \, d_\Lambda
\, \partial_i^\Lambda\mathcal{L},&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;d_\Lambda=d_{\lambda_1}\cdots d_{\lambda_k}, \qquad
d_\lambda=\partial_\lambda + y^i_\lambda\partial_i +\cdots,&lt;/math&gt;

denote the total derivatives.

For instance, a first-order Lagrangian and its second-order Euler–Lagrange operator take the form

: &lt;math&gt;L=\mathcal{L}(x^\lambda,y^i,y^i_\lambda) \, d^nx,\qquad
\delta_i L =\partial_i\mathcal{L} - d_\lambda
\partial_i^\lambda\mathcal{L}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Euler–Lagrange equations ===
The kernel of an Euler–Lagrange operator provides the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s {{math|''δL'' {{=}} 0}}.

== Cohomology and Noether's theorems==
[[Cohomology]] of the variational bicomplex leads to the so-called
variational formula

: &lt;math&gt;dL=\delta L + d_H \Theta_L,&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;d_H\Theta_L=dx^\lambda\wedge d_\lambda\phi, \qquad \phi\in
O^*_\infty(Y)&lt;/math&gt;

is the total differential and {{math|θ&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a Lepage equivalent of {{math|''L''}}. [[Noether's first theorem]] and [[Noether's second theorem]] are corollaries of this variational formula.

== Graded manifolds ==
Extended to [[graded manifold]]s, the [[variational bicomplex]] provides description of graded Lagrangian systems of even and odd variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sardanashvily|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative formulations ==
In a different way, Lagrangians, Euler–Lagrange operators and Euler–Lagrange equations are introduced in the framework of the [[calculus of variations]].

== Classical mechanics ==
In classical mechanics equations of motion are first and second order differential equations on a manifold {{math|''M''}} or various fiber bundles {{math|''Q''}} over {{math|ℝ}}. A solution of the equations of motion is called a ''motion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1989|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Giachetta|Mangiarotti|Sardanashvily|2011|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Laws of Form''''' (hereinafter '''''LoF''''') is a book by [[G. Spencer-Brown]], published in 1969, that straddles the boundary between [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]]. ''LoF'' describes three distinct [[logical system]]s:
* The "primary arithmetic" (described in Chapter 4 of ''LoF''), whose models include [[Two-element Boolean algebra#Some basic identities|Boolean arithmetic]];
* The "primary [[algebra]]" (Chapter 6 of ''LoF''), whose [[interpretation (logic)|models]] include the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] (hereinafter abbreviated '''2'''), [[Boolean logic]], and the classical [[propositional calculus]];
* "Equations of the second degree" (Chapter 11), whose [[interpretation (logic)|interpretations]] include [[finite automata]] and [[Alonzo Church]]'s Restricted Recursive Arithmetic (RRA).

"Boundary algebra" is Meguire's (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Meguire, P. (2011) Boundary Algebra: A Simpler Approach to Basic Logic and Boolean Algebra. Saarbrücken: VDM Publishing Ltd. 168pp&lt;/ref&gt; term for the union of the primary algebra and the primary arithmetic. ''Laws of Form'' sometimes loosely refers to the "primary algebra" as well as to ''LoF''.

==The book==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2018}}
''LoF'' emerged from work in electronic engineering its author did around 1960, and from subsequent lectures on [[mathematical logic]] he gave under the auspices of the [[University of London]]'s extension program. ''LoF'' has appeared in several editions, the most recent being a 1997 German translation, and has never gone out of print.{{when|date=November 2018}}

The mathematics fills only about 55pp and is rather elementary.{{OR|date=November 2018}} But ''LoF'''s mystical and declamatory prose, and its love of [[paradox]], make it a challenging read for all. Spencer-Brown was influenced by [[Wittgenstein]] and [[R. D. Laing]]. ''LoF'' also echoes a number of themes from the writings of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead]].

The entire book is written in an operational way, giving instructions to the reader instead of telling him what "is". In accordance with G. Spencer-Brown's interest in paradoxes, the only sentence that makes a statement that something is, is the statement, which says no such statements are used in this book.&lt;ref&gt;Felix Lau: ''Die Form der Paradoxie'', 2005 Carl-Auer Verlag, {{ISBN|9783896703521}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for this one sentence the book can be seen as an example of [[E-Prime]].

==Reception==
Ostensibly a work of formal mathematics and philosophy, ''LoF'' became something of a [[cult classic]], praised in the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]''. Those who agree point to ''LoF'' as embodying an enigmatic "mathematics of [[consciousness]]," its algebraic symbolism capturing an (perhaps even "the") implicit root of [[cognition]]:  the ability to "distinguish". ''LoF'' argues that primary algebra reveals striking connections among [[logic]], [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], and arithmetic, and the [[philosophy of language]] and [[Philosophy of mind|mind]].

Banaschewski (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ndjfl/1093888028 | author=B. Banaschewski | title=On G. Spencer Brown's Laws of Form | journal=Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic | volume=18 | number=3 | pages=507&amp;mdash;509 | date=Jul 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the primary algebra is nothing but new notation for Boolean algebra. Indeed, the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] '''2''' can be seen as the intended interpretation of the primary algebra. Yet the notation of the primary algebra:
* Fully exploits the [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]] characterizing not just [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s but all [[Lattice (order)|lattice]]s;
*Highlights how syntactically distinct statements in logic and '''2''' can have identical [[semantics]];
* Dramatically simplifies Boolean algebra calculations, and proofs in [[sentential logic|sentential]] and [[syllogism|syllogistic]] [[logic]].
Moreover, the syntax of the primary algebra can be extended to formal systems other than '''2''' and sentential logic, resulting in boundary mathematics (see Related Work below).

''LoF'' has influenced, among others, [[Heinz von Foerster]], [[Louis Kauffman]], [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[Humberto Maturana]], [[Francisco Varela]] and [[William Bricken]]. Some of these authors have modified the primary algebra in a variety of interesting ways.

''LoF'' claimed that certain well-known mathematical conjectures of very long standing, such as the [[Four Color Theorem]], [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and the [[Goldbach conjecture]], are provable using extensions of the primary algebra. Spencer-Brown eventually circulated a purported proof of the Four Color Theorem, but it met with skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;For a sympathetic evaluation, see [https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0112266 Kauffman (2001)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The form (Chapter 1)==
The symbol:

:[[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]]

also called the "mark" or "cross", is the essential feature of the Laws of Form. In Spencer-Brown's inimitable and enigmatic fashion, the Mark symbolizes the root of [[cognition]], i.e., the [[duality (mathematics)|dualistic]] Mark indicates the capability of differentiating a "this" from "everything else ''but'' this."

In ''LoF'', a Cross denotes the drawing of a "distinction", and can be thought of as signifying the following, all at once:
* The act of drawing a boundary around something, thus separating it from everything else;
* That which becomes distinct from everything by drawing the boundary;
* Crossing from one side of the boundary to the other.

All three ways imply an action on the part of the cognitive entity (e.g., person) making the distinction.  As ''LoF'' puts it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The first command:
* Draw a distinction
can well be expressed in such ways as:
* Let there be a distinction,
* Find a distinction,
* See a distinction,
* Describe a distinction,
* Define a distinction,
Or:
* Let a distinction be drawn." (''LoF'', Notes to chapter 2)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The counterpoint to the Marked state is the Unmarked state, which is simply nothing, the void, or the un-expressable infinite represented by a blank space. It is simply the absence of a Cross. No distinction has been made and nothing has been crossed. The Marked state and the void are the two primitive values of the Laws of Form.

The Cross can be seen as denoting the distinction between two states, one "considered as a symbol" and another not so considered. From this fact arises a curious resonance with some theories of [[consciousness]] and [[language]]. Paradoxically, the Form is at once Observer and Observed, and is also the creative act of making an observation. ''LoF'' (excluding back matter) closes with the words:

"...the first distinction, the Mark and the observer are not only interchangeable, but, in the form, identical."

[[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] came to a related insight in the 1890s; see [[#Related work|Related Work]].

==The primary arithmetic (Chapter 4)==
The [[syntax]] of the primary arithmetic goes as follows. There are just two [[atomic formula|atomic expressions]]:
* The empty Cross [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]]  ;
*All or part of the blank page (the "void").
There are two inductive rules:
* A Cross [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]]  may be written over any expression;
* Any two expressions may be [[concatenation|concatenated]].
The [[semantics]] of the primary arithmetic are perhaps nothing more than the sole explicit [[definition]] in ''LoF'': "Distinction is perfect continence".

Let the "unmarked state" be a synonym for the void. Let an empty Cross denote the "marked state". To cross is to move from one value, the unmarked or marked state, to the other. We can now state the "arithmetical" [[axiom]]s A1 and A2, which ground the primary arithmetic (and hence all of the Laws of Form):

"A1. The law of Calling". Calling twice from a state is indistinguishable from calling once. To make a distinction twice has the same effect as making it once. For example, saying "Let there be light" and then saying "Let there be light" again, is the same as saying it once.  Formally:

::[[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]] [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]] &lt;math&gt;\ =&lt;/math&gt;[[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]]

"A2. The law of Crossing." After crossing from the unmarked to the marked state, crossing again ("recrossing") starting from the marked state returns one to the unmarked state. Hence recrossing annuls crossing. Formally:

::[[Image:Laws of Form - double cross.gif]] &lt;math&gt;\ =&lt;/math&gt;

In both A1 and A2, the expression to the right of '=' has fewer symbols than the expression to the left of '='. This suggests that every primary arithmetic expression can, by repeated application of A1 and A2, be ''simplified'' to one of two states: the marked or the unmarked state. This is indeed the case, and the result is the expression's "simplification". The two fundamental metatheorems of the primary arithmetic state that:
* Every finite expression has a unique simplification. (T3 in ''LoF'');
* Starting from an initial marked or unmarked state, "complicating" an expression by a finite number of repeated application of A1 and A2 cannot yield an expression whose simplification differs from the initial state. (T4 in ''LoF'').
Thus the [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] of [[logical equivalence]] [[partition of a set|partitions]] all primary arithmetic expressions into two [[equivalence class]]es: those that simplify to the Cross, and those that simplify to the void.

A1 and A2 have loose analogs in the properties of series and parallel electrical circuits, and in other ways of diagramming processes, including flowcharting. A1 corresponds to a parallel connection and A2 to a series connection, with the understanding that making a distinction corresponds to changing how two points in a circuit are connected, and not simply to adding wiring.

The primary arithmetic is analogous to the following formal languages from [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]]:
* A [[Dyck language]] of order 1 with a null alphabet;
* The simplest [[context-free language]] in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]];
* A [[rewrite system]] that is [[strongly normalizing]] and [[confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]].

The phrase "calculus of indications" in ''LoF'' is a synonym for "primary arithmetic".

===The notion of canon===
A concept peculiar to ''LoF'' is that of "canon". While ''LoF'' does not define canon, the following two excerpts from the Notes to chpt. 2 are apt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The more important structures of command are sometimes called ''canons''. They are the ways in which the guiding injunctions appear to group themselves in constellations, and are thus by no means independent of each other. A canon bears the distinction of being outside (i.e., describing) the system under construction, but a command to construct (e.g., 'draw a distinction'), even though it may be of central importance, is not a canon. A canon is an order, or set of orders, to permit or allow, but not to construct or create."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...the primary form of mathematical communication is not description but injunction... Music is a similar art form, the composer does not even attempt to describe the set of sounds he has in mind, much less the set of feelings occasioned through them, but writes down a set of commands which, if they are obeyed by the performer, can result in a reproduction, to the listener, of the composer's original experience."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These excerpts relate to the distinction in [[metalogic]] between the [[object language]], the formal language of the logical system under discussion, and the [[metalanguage]], a language (often a natural language) distinct from the object language, employed to exposit and discuss the object language. The first quote seems to assert that the ''canons'' are part of the metalanguage. The second quote seems to assert that statements in the object language are essentially commands addressed to the reader by the author. Neither assertion holds in standard metalogic.

==The primary algebra (Chapter 6)==

===Syntax===
Given any valid primary arithmetic expression, insert into one or more locations any number of Latin letters bearing optional numerical subscripts; the result is a primary algebra [[formula]]. Letters so employed in [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] are called [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]. A primary algebra variable indicates a location where one can write the primitive value [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]] or its complement [[Image:Laws of Form - double cross.gif]]. Multiple instances of the same variable denote multiple locations of the same primitive value.

===Rules governing logical equivalence===
The sign '=' may link two logically equivalent expressions; the result is an [[equation]]. By "logically equivalent" is meant that the two expressions have the same simplification. [[Logical equivalence]] is an [[equivalence relation]] over the set of primary algebra formulas, governed by the rules R1 and R2. Let "C" and "D" be formulae each containing at least one instance of the subformula ''A'':
*'''R1''', ''Substitution of equals''. Replace ''one or more'' instances of ''A'' in ''C'' by ''B'', resulting in ''E''. If ''A''=''B'', then ''C''=''E''.
*'''R2''', ''Uniform replacement''. Replace ''all'' instances of ''A'' in ''C'' and ''D'' with ''B''. ''C'' becomes ''E'' and ''D'' becomes ''F''. If ''C''=''D'', then ''E''=''F''. Note that ''A''=''B'' is not required.
'''R2''' is employed very frequently in ''primary algebra'' demonstrations (see below), almost always silently. These rules are routinely invoked in [[logic]] and most of mathematics, nearly always unconsciously.

The ''primary algebra'' consists of [[equations]], i.e., pairs of formulae linked by an infix '='. '''R1''' and '''R2''' enable transforming one equation into another. Hence the ''primary algebra'' is an ''equational''  formal system, like the many [[algebraic structures]], including [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], that are [[variety (universal algebra)|varieties]]. Equational logic was common before ''Principia Mathematica'' (e.g., Peirce,&lt;sup&gt;1,2,3&lt;/sup&gt; Johnson 1892), and has present-day advocates (Gries and Schneider 1993).

Conventional [[mathematical logic]] consists of [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]] formulae, signalled by a prefixed [[Turnstile (symbol)|turnstile]]. To denote that the ''primary algebra'' formula ''A'' is a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], simply write "''A'' =[[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]] ". If one replaces '=' in '''R1''' and '''R2''' with the [[biconditional]], the resulting rules hold in conventional logic. However, conventional logic relies mainly on the rule [[modus ponens]]; thus conventional logic is ''ponential''. The equational-ponential dichotomy distills much of what distinguishes mathematical logic from the rest of mathematics.

===Initials===
An ''initial'' is a ''primary algebra'' equation verifiable by a [[decision procedure]] and as such is ''not'' an [[axiom]]. ''LoF'' lays down the initials:

{|
|-
| 
*J1:
|
{| style="border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;"
|-
|
{|
|-
|
{| style="border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;"
|-
| A
|}
| A
|}
|}
| = .
|}
The absence of anything to the right of the "=" above, is deliberate.

{|

*J2:

|
{| style="border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;"
|-
| B C
|}
|}
|}
|.
|}


'''J2''' is the familiar [[distributive law]] of [[sentential logic]] and [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]].

Another set of initials, friendlier to calculations, is:

{|
|-
| 
*J0:
|
{| style="border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;"
|-
|
{| style="border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;"

| A.
|}

{|
|-
|
*J1a:
|
{|
|-
|
{| style="border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;"
|-
| A
|}
| A
|}
| =
|
{| style="border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;"
|-

|}

{|
|-
| 
*C2:
| A
|
{| style="border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;"
|-
| A B
|}
| = 
| A
|
{| style="border-top: 2px solid black; border-right: 2px solid black;"
|-
| B
|}
|.
|}

It is thanks to '''C2''' that the ''primary algebra'' is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. By virtue of '''J1a''', it is a [[complemented lattice]] whose upper bound is [[Image:Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif]]. By '''J0''', [[Image:Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif]] is the corresponding lower bound and [[identity element]]. '''J0''' is also an algebraic version of '''A2''' and makes clear the sense in which [[Image:Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif]] aliases with the blank page.

T13 in ''LoF'' generalizes '''C2''' as follows. Any ''primary algebra'' (or sentential logic) formula ''B'' can be viewed as an [[ordered tree]] with ''branches''. Then:

'''T13''': A [[formula|subformula]] ''A'' can be copied at will into any depth of ''B'' greater than that of ''A'', as long as ''A'' and its copy are in the same branch of ''B''. Also, given multiple instances of ''A'' in the same branch of ''B'', all instances but the shallowest are redundant.

While a proof of T13 would require [[mathematical induction|induction]], the intuition underlying it should be clear.

'''C2''' or its equivalent is named:
*"Generation" in ''LoF'';
*"Exclusion" in Johnson (1892);
*"Pervasion" in the work of William Bricken.
Perhaps the first instance of an axiom or rule with the power of '''C2''' was the "Rule of (De)Iteration," combining T13 and ''AA=A'', of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]]'s [[existential graph]]s.

''LoF'' asserts that concatenation can be read as [[commutativity|commuting]] and [[associativity|associating]] by default and hence need not be explicitly assumed or demonstrated. (Peirce made a similar assertion about his [[existential graph]]s.) Let a period be a temporary notation to establish grouping. That concatenation commutes and associates may then be demonstrated from the:
* Initial ''AC.D''=''CD.A'' and the consequence ''AA''=''A'' (Byrne 1946). This result holds for all [[lattice (order)|lattices]], because ''AA''=''A'' is an easy consequence of the [[absorption law]], which holds for all lattices;
* Initials ''AC.D''=''AD.C'' and '''J0'''. Since '''J0''' holds only for lattices with a lower bound, this method holds only for [[bounded lattice]]s (which include the ''primary algebra'' and '''2'''). Commutativity is trivial; just set ''A''=[[Image:Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif]]. Associativity: ''AC.D'' = ''CA.D'' = ''CD.A'' = ''A.CD''.
Having demonstrated associativity, the period can be discarded.

The initials in Meguire (2011) are ''AC.D''=''CD.A'', called '''B1'''; '''B2''', J0 above; '''B3''', J1a above; and '''B4''', C2. By design, these initials are very similar to the axioms for an [[abelian group]], '''G1-G3''' below.

===Proof theory===
The ''primary algebra'' contains three kinds of proved assertions:
* ''Consequence'' is a ''primary algebra'' equation verified by a ''demonstration''. A demonstration consists of a sequence of ''steps'', each step justified by an initial or a previously demonstrated consequence.
* ''[[Theorem]]'' is a statement in the [[metalanguage]] verified by a ''[[Mathematical proof|proof]]'', i.e., an argument, formulated in the metalanguage, that is accepted by trained mathematicians and logicians.
* ''Initial'', defined above. Demonstrations and proofs invoke an initial as if it were an axiom.

The distinction between consequence and [[theorem]] holds for all formal systems, including mathematics and logic, but is usually not made explicit. A demonstration or [[decision procedure]] can be carried out and verified by computer. The [[Mathematical proof|proof]] of a [[theorem]] cannot be.

Let ''A'' and ''B'' be ''primary algebra'' [[formula]]s. A demonstration of ''A''=''B'' may proceed in either of two ways:
* Modify ''A'' in steps until ''B'' is obtained, or vice versa;
* Simplify both (''A'')''B'' and (''B'')''A'' to [[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]]. This is known as a "calculation".
Once ''A''=''B'' has been demonstrated, ''A''=''B'' can be invoked to justify steps in subsequent demonstrations. ''primary algebra'' demonstrations and calculations often require no more than '''J1a''', '''J2''', '''C2''', and the consequences ()''A''=() ('''C3''' in ''LoF''), ((''A''))=''A'' ('''C1'''), and ''AA''=''A'' ('''C5''').

The consequence (((''A'')''B'')''C'') = (''AC'')((''B'')''C''), '''C7''' in ''LoF'', enables an [[algorithm]], sketched in ''LoF''s proof of T14, that transforms an arbitrary ''primary algebra'' formula to an equivalent formula whose depth does not exceed two. The result is a ''normal form'', the ''primary algebra'' analog of the [[conjunctive normal form]]. ''LoF'' (T14-15) proves the ''primary algebra'' analog of the well-known [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] theorem that every formula has a normal form.

Let ''A'' be a [[formula|subformula]] of some [[formula]] ''B''. When paired with '''C3''', '''J1a''' can be viewed as the closure condition for calculations: ''B'' is a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] [[if and only if]] ''A'' and (''A'') both appear in depth 0 of ''B''. A related condition appears in some versions of [[natural deduction]]. A demonstration by calculation is often little more than:
* Invoking T13 repeatedly to eliminate redundant subformulae;
* Erasing any subformulae having the form ((''A'')''A'').
The last step of a calculation always invokes '''J1a'''.

''LoF'' includes elegant new proofs of the following standard [[metatheory]]:
* ''[[Completeness (logic)|Completeness]]'': all ''primary algebra'' consequences are demonstrable from the initials (T17).
* ''[[axiom|Independence]]'': '''J1''' cannot be demonstrated from '''J2''' and vice versa (T18).
That [[sentential logic]] is complete is taught in every first university course in [[mathematical logic]]. But university courses in Boolean algebra seldom mention the completeness of '''2'''.

===Interpretations===
If the Marked and Unmarked states are read as the [[two-element Boolean algebra|Boolean]] values 1 and 0 (or '''True''' and '''False'''), the ''primary algebra'' [[interpretation (logic)|interprets]] '''[[two-element Boolean algebra|2]]''' (or [[sentential logic]]). ''LoF'' shows how the ''primary algebra'' can interpret the [[syllogism]]. Each of these [[interpretation (logic)|interpretations]] is discussed in a subsection below. Extending the ''primary algebra'' so that it could [[interpretation (logic)|interpret]] standard [[first-order logic]] has yet to be done, but [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]]'s ''beta'' [[existential graph]]s suggest that this extension is feasible.

====Two-element Boolean algebra 2====
The ''primary algebra'' is an elegant minimalist notation for the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] '''2'''. Let:
* One of Boolean [[join (mathematics)|join]] (+) or [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] (×) interpret [[concatenation]];
* The [[Complement (order theory)|complement]] of ''A'' interpret [[Image:Laws of Form - not a.gif]]
* 0 (1) interpret the empty Mark if join (meet) interprets [[concatenation]] (because a binary operation applied to zero operands may be regarded as being equal to the [[identity element]] of that operation; or to put it in another way, an operand that is missing could be regarded as acting by default like the identity element). 
If join (meet) interprets ''AC'', then meet (join) interprets ((''A'')(''C'')). Hence the ''primary algebra'' and '''2''' are isomorphic but for one detail: ''primary algebra'' complementation can be nullary, in which case it denotes a primitive value. Modulo this detail, '''2''' is a [[model theory|model]] of the primary algebra. The primary arithmetic suggests the following arithmetic axiomatization of '''2''': 1+1=1+0=0+1=1=~0, and 0+0=0=~1.

The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;\ B=\{&lt;/math&gt;[[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]] &lt;math&gt;,&lt;/math&gt; [[Image:Laws of Form - double cross.gif]]&lt;math&gt;\ \}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boolean domain]] or ''carrier''. In the language of [[universal algebra]], the ''primary algebra'' is the [[algebraic structure]] &lt;math&gt;\lang B,--,(-),() \rang&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;\lang 2,1,0 \rang&lt;/math&gt;. The [[functional completeness|expressive adequacy]] of the [[Sheffer stroke]] points to the ''primary algebra'' also being a &lt;math&gt;\lang B,(--),()\rang&lt;/math&gt; algebra of type &lt;math&gt;\lang 2,0 \rang&lt;/math&gt;. In both cases, the identities are J1a, J0, C2, and ''ACD=CDA''. Since the ''primary algebra'' and '''2''' are [[isomorphic]], '''2''' can be seen as a &lt;math&gt;\lang B,+,\lnot,1 \rang&lt;/math&gt; algebra of type &lt;math&gt;\lang 2,1,0 \rang&lt;/math&gt;. This description of '''2''' is simpler than the conventional one, namely an &lt;math&gt;\lang B,+,\times,\lnot,1,0 \rang&lt;/math&gt; algebra of type &lt;math&gt;\lang 2,2,1,0,0 \rang&lt;/math&gt;.

The two possible interpretations are dual to each other in the Boolean sense. (In Boolean algebra, exchanging AND &amp;harr; OR and 1 &amp;harr; 0 throughout an equation yields an equally valid equation.) The identities remain invariant regardless of which interpretation is chosen, so the transformations or modes of calculation remain the same; only the interpretation of each form would be different. Example: J1a is (''A'') ''A'' = (). Interpreting juxtaposition as OR and () as 1, this translates to &lt;math&gt;\neg A \lor A = 1&lt;/math&gt; which is true. Interpreting juxtaposition as AND and () as 0, this translates to &lt;math&gt;\neg A \land A = 0&lt;/math&gt; which is true as well (and the dual of &lt;math&gt;\neg A \lor A = 1&lt;/math&gt;).

====Sentential logic====
Let the blank page denote '''True''' or '''False''', and let a Cross be read as '''Not'''. Then the primary arithmetic has the following sentential reading:

:::&amp;nbsp;= &amp;nbsp; '''False'''

::[[Image:Laws of Form - cross.gif]] &amp;nbsp;= &amp;nbsp;'''True''' &amp;nbsp;= &amp;nbsp;'''not False'''

::[[Image:Laws of Form - double cross.gif]] &amp;nbsp;= &amp;nbsp;'''Not True''' &amp;nbsp;= &amp;nbsp;'''False'''

The ''primary algebra'' interprets sentential logic as follows. A letter represents any given sentential expression. Thus:

::[[Image:Laws of Form - not a.gif]] interprets '''Not A'''

::[[Image:Laws of Form - a or b.gif]] interprets '''A Or B'''

::[[Image:Laws of Form - if a then b.gif]] interprets '''Not A Or B'''  or   '''If A Then B'''.

::[[Image:Laws of Form - a and b.gif]] interprets '''Not (Not A Or Not B)'''
:::::or '''Not (If A Then Not B)'''
:::::or '''A And B'''.

Thus any expression in [[sentential logic]] has a ''primary algebra'' translation. Equivalently, the ''primary algebra'' [[interpretation (logic)|interprets]] sentential logic. Given an assignment of every variable to the Marked or Unmarked states, this ''primary algebra'' translation reduces to a primary arithmetic expression, which can be simplified. Repeating this exercise for all possible assignments of the two primitive values to each variable, reveals whether the original expression is [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]] or [[Satisfiability|satisfiable]]. This is an example of a [[decision procedure]], one more or less in the spirit of conventional truth tables. Given some ''primary algebra'' formula containing ''N'' variables, this decision procedure requires simplifying 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; primary arithmetic formulae. For a less tedious decision procedure more in the spirit of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s "truth value analysis," see Meguire (2003).

Schwartz (1981) proved that the ''primary algebra'' is equivalent -- [[syntax|syntactically]], [[semantics|semantically]], and [[proof theory|proof theoretically]]—with the [[Propositional calculus|classical propositional calculus]]. Likewise, it can be shown that the ''primary algebra'' is syntactically equivalent with expressions built up in the usual way from the classical [[truth value]]s '''true''' and '''false''', the [[logical connective]]s NOT, OR, and AND, and parentheses.

Interpreting the Unmarked State as '''False''' is wholly arbitrary; that state can equally well be read as '''True'''. All that is required is that the interpretation of [[concatenation]] change from OR to AND. IF A THEN B now translates as (''A''(''B'')) instead of (''A'')''B''. More generally, the ''primary algebra'' is "self-[[Duality (mathematics)|dual]]," meaning that any ''primary algebra'' formula has two [[sentential logic|sentential]] or [[two-element Boolean algebra|Boolean]] readings, each the [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] of the other. Another consequence of self-duality is the irrelevance of [[De Morgan's laws]]; those laws are built into the syntax of the ''primary algebra'' from the outset.

The true nature of the distinction between the ''primary algebra'' on the one hand, and '''2''' and sentential logic on the other, now emerges. In the latter formalisms, [[Logical complement|complementation]]/[[negation]] operating on "nothing" is not well-formed. But an empty Cross is a well-formed ''primary algebra'' expression, denoting the Marked state, a primitive value. Hence a nonempty Cross is an [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]], while an empty Cross is an [[operand]] because it denotes a primitive value. Thus the ''primary algebra'' reveals that the heretofore distinct mathematical concepts of operator and operand are in fact merely different facets of a single fundamental action, the making of a distinction.

====Syllogisms====
Appendix 2 of ''LoF'' shows how to translate traditional [[syllogism]]s and [[polysyllogism|sorites]] into the ''primary algebra''. A valid syllogism is simply one whose ''primary algebra'' translation simplifies to an empty Cross. Let ''A''* denote a ''literal'', i.e., either ''A'' or (''A''), indifferently. Then every syllogism that does not require that one or more terms be assumed nonempty is one of 24 possible permutations of a generalization of [[syllogism|Barbara]] whose ''primary algebra'' equivalent is (''A''*''B'')((''B'')''C''*)''A''*''C''*. These 24 possible permutations include the 19 syllogistic forms deemed valid in [[Aristotelian logic|Aristotelian]] and [[medieval logic]]. This ''primary algebra'' translation of syllogistic logic also suggests that the ''primary algebra'' can [[interpretation (logic)|interpret]] [[monadic logic|monadic]] and [[term logic]], and that the ''primary algebra'' has affinities to the [[Boolean term schema]]ta of Quine (1982: Part II).

===An example of calculation===
The following calculation of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s nontrivial ''Praeclarum Theorema'' exemplifies the demonstrative power of the ''primary algebra''. Let C1 be ((''A''))=''A'', C2 be ''A''(''A'' ''B'')=''A''(''B''), C3 be ()''A''=(), J1a be (''A'')''A''=(), and let OI mean that variables and subformulae have been reordered in a way that commutativity and associativity permit.

 [(''P''→''R'')∧(''Q''→''S'')]→[(''P''∧''Q'')→(''R''∧''S'')].                      ''Praeclarum Theorema''.

===Relation to magmas===
The ''primary algebra'' embodies a point noted by [[Edward Vermilye Huntington|Huntington]] in 1933: [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] requires, in addition to one [[unary operation]], one, and not two, [[binary operation]]s. Hence the seldom-noted fact that Boolean algebras are [[magma (algebra)|magmas]]. (Magmas were called [[groupoid]]s until the latter term was appropriated by [[category theory]].) To see this, note that the ''primary algebra'' is a [[commutative]]:
*[[Semigroup]] because ''primary algebra'' juxtaposition [[Commutative property|commute]]s and [[associative property|associates]];
*[[Monoid]] with [[identity element]] (()), by virtue of '''J0'''.

[[group (mathematics)|Groups]] also require a [[unary operation]], called [[Group (mathematics)#Definition|inverse]], the group counterpart of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean complementation]]. Let (''a'') denote the inverse of ''a''. Let () denote the group [[identity element]]. Then groups and the ''primary algebra'' have the same [[signature (logic)|signatures]], namely they are both 〈--,(-),()〉 algebras of type 〈2,1,0〉. Hence the ''primary algebra'' is a [[list of algebraic structures|boundary algebra]]. The axioms for an [[abelian group]], in boundary notation, are:
* '''G1'''. ''abc'' = ''acb'' (assuming association from the left);
* '''G2'''. ()''a'' = ''a'';
* '''G3'''. (''a'')''a'' = ().
From '''G1''' and '''G2''', the commutativity and associativity of concatenation may be derived, as above. Note that '''G3''' and '''J1a''' are identical. '''G2''' and '''J0''' would be identical if (())=() replaced '''A2'''. This is the defining arithmetical identity of group theory, in boundary notation.

The ''primary algebra'' differs from an [[abelian group]] in two ways:
*From '''A2''', it follows that (()) ≠ (). If the ''primary algebra'' were a [[group (mathematics)|group]], (())=() would hold, and one of (''a'')''a''=(()) or ''a''()=''a'' would have to be a ''primary algebra'' consequence. Note that () and (()) are mutual ''primary algebra'' complements, as group theory requires, so that ((())) = () is true of both group theory and the ''primary algebra'';
*'''C2''' most clearly demarcates the ''primary algebra'' from other magmas, because '''C2''' enables demonstrating the [[absorption law]] that defines [[lattice (order)|lattices]], and the [[distributive law]] central to [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]].
Both '''A2''' and '''C2''' follow from ''B'' 's being an [[ordered set]].

==Equations of the second degree (Chapter 11)==
Chapter 11 of ''LoF'' introduces ''equations of the second degree'', composed of [[recursion|recursive]] formulae that can be seen as having "infinite" depth. Some recursive formulae simplify to the marked or unmarked state. Others "oscillate" indefinitely between the two states depending on whether a given depth is even or odd. Specifically, certain recursive formulae can be interpreted as oscillating between '''true''' and '''false''' over successive intervals of time, in which case a formula is deemed to have an "imaginary" truth value. Thus the flow of time may be introduced into the ''primary algebra''.

Turney (1986) shows how these recursive formulae can be interpreted via [[Alonzo Church]]'s Restricted Recursive Arithmetic (RRA). Church introduced RRA in 1955 as an axiomatic formalization of [[finite automata]]. Turney (1986) presents a general method for translating equations of the second degree into Church's RRA, illustrating his method using the formulae '''E1''', '''E2''', and '''E4''' in chapter 11 of ''LoF''. This translation into RRA sheds light on the names Spencer-Brown gave to '''E1''' and '''E4''', namely "memory" and "counter". RRA thus formalizes and clarifies ''LoF'' 's notion of an imaginary truth value.

[[Gottfried Leibniz]], in memoranda not published before the late 19th and early 20th centuries, invented [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean logic]]. His notation was isomorphic to that of ''LoF'': concatenation read as [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], and "non-(''X'')" read as the [[Logical complement|complement]] of ''X''. Leibniz's pioneering role in [[algebraic logic]] was foreshadowed by [[Clarence Irving Lewis|Lewis]] (1918) and [[Nicholas Rescher|Rescher]] (1954). But a full appreciation of Leibniz's accomplishments had to await the work of Wolfgang Lenzen, published in the 1980s and reviewed in [https://www.worldcat.org/title/calculus-universalis-studien-zur-logik-von-gw-leibniz/oclc/55653339 Lenzen (2004).]

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) anticipated the ''primary algebra'' in three veins of work:
#Two papers he wrote in 1886 proposed a logical algebra employing but one symbol, the ''streamer'', nearly identical to the Cross of ''LoF''.  The semantics of the streamer are identical to those of the Cross, except that Peirce never wrote a streamer with nothing under it. An excerpt from one of these papers was published in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;"Qualitative Logic", MS 736 (c. 1886) in Eisele, Carolyn, ed. 1976. ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce]]. Vol. 4, Mathematical Philosophy''. (The Hague) Mouton: 101-15.1&lt;/ref&gt; but they were not published in full until 1993.&lt;ref&gt;"Qualitative Logic", MS 582 (1886) in Kloesel, Christian et al., eds., 1993. ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings of Charles S. Peirce: A Chronological Edition]], Vol. 5, 1884-1886''. [[Indiana University Press]]: 323-71. "The Logic of Relatives: Qualitative and Quantitative", MS 584 (1886) in Kloesel, Christian et al., eds., 1993. ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce: A Chronological Edition, Vol. 5, 1884-1886''. Indiana University Press: 372-78.&lt;/ref&gt;
#In a 1902 encyclopedia article,&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in Peirce, C.S. (1933) ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce]], Vol. 4'', [[Charles Hartshorne]] and [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]], eds. [[Harvard University Press]]. Paragraphs 378-383&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce notated Boolean algebra and sentential logic in the manner of this entry, except that he employed two styles of brackets, toggling between '(', ')' and '[', ']' with each increment in formula depth.
#The [[syntax]] of his alpha [[existential graph]]s is merely [[concatenation]], read as [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], and enclosure by ovals, read as [[negation]].&lt;ref&gt;The existential graphs are described at length in Peirce, C.S. (1933) ''Collected Papers, Vol. 4'', [[Charles Hartshorne]] and [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]], eds. Harvard University Press. Paragraphs 347-529.&lt;/ref&gt; If ''primary algebra'' concatenation is read as [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], then these graphs are [[isomorphic]] to the ''primary algebra'' [http://www2.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/CHK.pdf (Kauffman 2001).]
Ironically, ''LoF'' cites vol. 4 of Peirce's ''Collected Papers,'' the source for the formalisms in (2) and (3) above.
(1)-(3) were virtually unknown at the time when (1960s) and in the place where (UK) ''LoF'' was written. Peirce's [[semiotics]], about which ''LoF'' is silent, may yet shed light on the philosophical aspects of ''LoF''.

[http://www2.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/CHK.pdf Kauffman  (2001)] discusses another notation similar to that of ''LoF'', that of a 1917 article by [[Jean Nicod]], who was a disciple of [[Bertrand Russell]]'s.

The above formalisms are, like the ''primary algebra'', all instances of ''boundary mathematics'', i.e., mathematics whose syntax is limited to letters and brackets (enclosing devices). A minimalist syntax of this nature is a "boundary notation." Boundary notation is free of [[infix]], [[Polish notation|prefix]], or [[Reverse Polish notation|postfix]] operator symbols. The very well known curly braces ('{', '}') of set theory can be seen as a boundary notation.

The work of Leibniz, Peirce, and Nicod is innocent of metatheory, as they wrote before [[Emil Post]]'s landmark 1920 paper (which ''LoF'' cites), proving that [[sentential logic]] is complete, and before [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] and [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]] showed how to prove [[axiom independence]] using [[model theory|model]]s.

[[William Craig (logician)|Craig]] (1979) argued that the world, and how humans perceive and interact with that world, has a rich Boolean structure. Craig was an orthodox logician and an authority on [[algebraic logic]].

Second-generation [[cognitive science]] emerged in the 1970s, after ''LoF'' was written. On cognitive science and its relevance to Boolean algebra, logic, and [[set theory]], see Lakoff (1987) (see index entries under "Image schema examples: container") and Lakoff and Núñez (2001). Neither book cites ''LoF''.

The biologists and cognitive scientists [[Humberto Maturana]] and his student [[Francisco Varela]] both discuss ''LoF'' in their writings, which identify "distinction" as the fundamental cognitive act. The Berkeley psychologist and cognitive scientist [[Eleanor Rosch]] has written extensively on the closely related notion of categorization.

Other formal systems with possible affinities to the primary algebra include:
*[[Mereology]] which typically has a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] structure very similar to that of Boolean algebra. For a few authors, mereology is simply a [[model theory|model]] of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] and hence of the primary algebra as well.
*[[Mereotopology]], which is inherently richer than Boolean algebra;
*The system of  Whitehead (1934), whose fundamental primitive is "indication."

The primary arithmetic and algebra are a minimalist formalism for [[sentential logic]] and Boolean algebra. Other minimalist formalisms having the power of [[set theory]] include:
* The [[lambda calculus]];
* [[Combinatory logic]] with two ('''S''' and '''K''') or even one ('''X''') primitive combinators;
* [[Mathematical logic]] done with merely three primitive notions: one connective, [[Sheffer stroke|NAND]] (whose ''primary algebra'' translation is (''AB'') or, dually, (''A'')(''B'')), universal [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]], and one [[binary relation|binary]] [[atomic formula]], denoting [[Set (mathematics)|set]] membership. This is the system of [[Willard Quine|Quine]] (1951).
* The ''beta'' [[existential graph]]s, with a single [[binary predicate]] denoting set membership. This has yet to be explored. The ''alpha'' graphs mentioned above are a special case of the ''beta'' graphs.

&lt;/ref&gt; formulated as an axiomatized subset of [[First-order predicate logic]].  A diagram in LePUS3 is also called a '''Codechart'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lepus.org.uk/ref/refman/refman.xml#Codechart Codechart, formal definition]&lt;/ref&gt; LePUS, the name of the first version of the language, is an abbreviation for ''Language for Pattern Uniform Specification''.

== Purpose ==

LePUS3 is tailored for the following purposes:

* ''Scalability'': To model large-scale programs using small Codecharts with only few symbols
* ''Automated verifiability'': To allow programmers to check fully automatically conformance to design so as to keep the design in synch with the implementation
* ''Program visualization'': To allow tools to reverse-engineer legible Codecharts from plain source code modeling their design
* ''Pattern implementation'': To allow tools to determine automatically whether your program implements a design pattern
* ''Design abstraction'': To specify unimplemented programs without committing prematurely to implementation minutiae
* ''Generality'': To model a design pattern not as a specific implementation but as a design motif
* ''Rigour'': To allow software designers to be sure exactly what Codecharts represent and reason rigorously about them

== Context ==
LePUS3 belongs to the following families of languages:
* ''Object-oriented software [[modeling language]]s'' (e.g., [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]): LePUS3 is a visual notation that is used to represent the building-blocks in the design of programs [[object-oriented programming]] languages
* ''[[Formal specification]] languages'': Like other Logic Visual Languages, Codecharts articulate sentences in mathematical logic. LePUS3 is axiomatized in and defined as a recursive (turing-decidable) subset of first-order predicate calculus.  Its semantics are defined using finite [[structure (mathematical logic)]].  
* ''[[Architecture description language]]s'': LePUS3 is a non-functional [[specification]] language used to represent design decisions about programs in class-based object-oriented programming languages (such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C++]]).
* ''Tool supported specification languages'': Verification of Codecharts (checking their consistency with a Java 1.4 program) can be established ('verified') by a click of a button, as demonstrated by the [http://ttp.essex.ac.uk/index.php?page=toolkit Two-Tier Programming Toolkit].
* ''[[Software visualization]] notations'' are notations which offer a graphical representation of the program, normally generated by reverse-engineering the source code of the program.

== Vocabulary ==
LePUS3 was designed to accommodate for parsimony and for economy of expression.  Its vocabulary consists of only 15 visual tokens.

==Design patterns==
LePUS3 was specifically designed to model, among others, the [[design pattern|'Gang of Four' design patterns]], including [[abstract factory pattern|abstract factory]], [[factory method pattern|factory method]], [[adapter pattern|adapter]], [[decorator pattern|decorator]], [[composite pattern|composite]], [[proxy pattern|proxy]], [[iterator pattern|iterator]], [[state pattern|state]], [[strategy pattern|strategy]], [[template method pattern|template method]], and [[visitor pattern|visitor]]. (See [http://www.lepus.org.uk/ref/companion/index.xml "The 'Gang of Four' Companion")] &lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; The abbreviation LePUS for "Language for Pattern Uniform Specification" is used because the precursor of this language was primarily concerned with design patterns.  The implementation of design patterns specified in LePUS3 can be automatically verified by the TTP Toolkit.&lt;ref name="nasa09" /&gt;

== Examples ==
LePUS3 is particularly suitable for modelling large programs, [[design patterns]], and object-oriented [[application framework]]s.  It is unsuitable for modelling non object-oriented programs, [[architectural style]]s, and [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] and [[semi-decidable]] properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2300">In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[functional analysis]], a '''Mackey space''' is a [[locally convex topological vector space]] ''X'' such that the [[topology]] of ''X'' coincides with the [[Mackey topology]] τ(''X'',''X&amp;prime;''), the [[finer topology|finest topology]] which still preserves the [[continuous dual]].

==Examples==
Examples of Mackey spaces include:
* All [[bornological space]]s.
* All Hausdorff locally convex [[barrelled space|quasi-barrelled]] (and hence all Hausdorff locally convex [[barrelled space]]s and all Hausdorff locally convex reflexive spaces).
* All Hausdorff locally convex [[metrizable space]]s.&lt;ref name="Schaefer (1999) p. 132"&gt;Schaefer (1999) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;
* All Hausdorff locally convex [[barreled space]]s.&lt;ref name="Schaefer (1999) p. 132"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* The product, locally convex direct sum, and the inductive limit of a family of Mackey spaces is a Mackey space.&lt;ref name="Schaefer (1999) p. 138"&gt;Schaefer (1999) p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
* A locally convex space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with continuous dual &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt; is a Mackey space if and only if each convex and &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X', X)&lt;/math&gt;-relatively compact subset of &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt; is equicontinuous.
* The [[Completion (metric space)|completion]] of a Mackey space is again a Mackey space.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (1999) p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;
* A separated quotient of a Mackey space is again a Mackey space.
* A Mackey space need not be separable, complete, quasi-barrelled, nor &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-quasi-barrelled.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3018">In [[mathematics]], two [[Square matrix|square matrices]]  '''''A''''' and '''''B''''' over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] are called '''congruent''' if there exists an [[invertible matrix]] '''''P'''''  over the same field such that 

:'''''P'''''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''''AP''''' = '''''B'''''

where "T" denotes the [[matrix transpose]].  Matrix congruence is an [[equivalence relation]].

Matrix congruence arises when considering the effect of [[change of basis]] on the [[Gram matrix]] attached to a [[bilinear form]] or [[quadratic form]] on a [[finite-dimensional]] [[vector space]]: two matrices are congruent if and only if they represent the same bilinear form with respect to different [[Basis (linear algebra)|bases]].

Note that [[Paul Halmos|Halmos]] defines congruence in terms of [[conjugate transpose]] (with respect to a complex [[inner product space]]) rather than transpose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Halmos | first=Paul R. | authorlink=Paul Halmos | title=Finite dimensional vector spaces | publisher=[[van Nostrand]] | year=1958 | page=134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this definition has not been adopted by most other authors.

==Congruence over the reals==

[[Sylvester's law of inertia]] states that two congruent [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] matrices with [[real number|real]] entries have the same numbers of positive, negative, and zero [[eigenvalue]]s.  That is, the number of eigenvalues of each sign is an invariant of the associated quadratic form.&lt;ref name="sylvester"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sylvester, J J | title=A demonstration of the theorem that every homogeneous quadratic polynomial is reducible by real orthogonal substitutions to the form of a sum of positive and negative squares | journal=Philosophical Magazine | volume=IV | pages=138–142 | year=1852 |  url=http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/sylv/inertia.pdf | accessdate=2007-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cube-maximal-independence.svg|thumb|300px|The [[hypercube graph|graph of the cube]] has six different maximal independent sets (two of them are maximum), shown as the red vertices.]]

In [[graph theory]], a '''maximal independent set''' (MIS) or '''maximal stable set''' is an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] that is not a subset of any other independent set. In other words, there is no vertex outside the independent set that may join it because it is maximal with respect to the independent set property.

For example, in the graph &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt;, a path with three vertices &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and two edges &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;bc&lt;/math&gt;, the sets &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{a, c\}&lt;/math&gt; are both maximally independent. The set &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; is independent, but is not maximal independent, because it is a subset of the larger independent set &lt;math&gt;\{a, c\}&lt;/math&gt;. In this same graph, the maximal cliques are the sets &lt;math&gt;\{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{b, c\}&lt;/math&gt;.

A MIS is also a [[dominating set]] in the graph, and every dominating set that is independent must be maximal independent, so MISs are also called '''independent dominating sets'''.  
[[File:Mis pathgraph p3.png|alt=A P3 graph has two maximal independent sets. {a} or {c} alone forms an independent set, but it is not maximal.|thumb|The top two &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt; graphs are maximal independent sets while the bottom two are independent sets, but not maximal. The maximum independent set is represented by the top left.]]
A graph may have many MISs of widely varying sizes;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Erdős|1966}} shows that the number of different sizes of MISs in an ''n''-vertex graph may be as large as ''n'' - log ''n'' - O(log log ''n'') and is never larger than ''n'' - log ''n''.&lt;/ref&gt; the largest, or possibly several equally large, MISs of a graph is called a [[maximum independent set]]. The graphs in which all maximal independent sets have the same size are called [[well-covered graph]]s.

The phrase "maximal independent set" is also used to describe maximal subsets of independent elements in mathematical structures other than graphs, and in particular in [[vector space]]s and [[matroid]]s.
[[File:Mis stargraph s8.png|alt=Independent sets for a star graph is an example of how vastly different the size of the maximal independent set can be to the maximum independent set. In this diagram, the star graph S8 has a maximal independent set of size 1 by selecting the internal node. It also has an maximal (and also maximum independent set) of size 8 by selecting each leave node instead.|thumb|Two independent sets for the [[Star (graph theory)|star graph]] &lt;math&gt;S_{8}&lt;/math&gt; show how vastly different in size two maximal independent sets (the right being maximum) can be. ]]
Two [[algorithmic problem]]s are associated with MISs: [[#Finding a single maximal independent set|finding a ''single'' MIS in a given graph]] and [[#Listing all maximal independent sets|listing ''all'' MISs in a given graph]].

== Definition ==
For a graph &lt;math&gt;G = (V, E)&lt;/math&gt;, an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a '''maximal independent set''' if for &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt;, one of the following is true:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;v \in S&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;N(v) \cap S \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;N(v)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the neighbors of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;
The above can be restated as a vertex either belongs to the independent set or has at least one neighbor vertex that belongs to the independent set. As a result, every edge of the graph has at least one endpoint not in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. However, it is not true that every edge of the graph has at least one, or even one endpoint in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that any neighbor to a vertex in the independent set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; cannot be in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; because these vertices are disjoint by the independent set definition.

== Related vertex sets ==

If ''S'' is a maximal independent set in some graph, it is a '''maximal clique''' or '''maximal complete subgraph''' in the [[complement graph|complementary graph]]. A maximal clique is a set of vertices that [[induced subgraph|induces]] a [[complete graph|complete subgraph]], and that is not a subset of the vertices of any larger complete subgraph. That is, it is a set ''S'' such that every pair of vertices in ''S'' is connected by an edge and every vertex not in ''S'' is missing an edge to at least one vertex in ''S''. A graph may have many maximal cliques, of varying sizes; finding the largest of these is the [[Clique problem|maximum clique problem]].

Some authors include maximality as part of the definition of a clique, and refer to maximal cliques simply as cliques.
[[File:Mis related sets.png|thumb|420x420px|Left is a maximal independent set. Middle is a clique, &lt;math&gt;K_3&lt;/math&gt;, on the graph complement. Right is a vertex cover on the maximal independent set complement.]]
The [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of a maximal independent set, that is, the set of vertices not belonging to the independent set, forms a '''minimal vertex cover'''. That is, the complement is a [[vertex cover]], a set of vertices that includes at least one endpoint of each edge, and is minimal in the sense that none of its vertices can be removed while preserving the property that it is a cover. Minimal vertex covers have been studied in [[statistical mechanics]] in connection with the [[Hard spheres|hard-sphere lattice gas]] model, a mathematical abstraction of fluid-solid state transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Weigt|Hartmann|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every maximal independent set is a [[dominating set]], a set of vertices such that every vertex in the graph either belongs to the set or is adjacent to the set. A set of vertices is a maximal independent set if and only if it is an independent dominating set.

== Graph family characterizations ==

Certain graph families have also been characterized in terms of their maximal cliques or maximal independent sets. Examples include the maximal-clique irreducible and hereditary maximal-clique irreducible graphs. A graph is said to be ''maximal-clique irreducible'' if every maximal clique has an edge that belongs to no other maximal clique, and ''hereditary maximal-clique irreducible'' if the same property is true for every induced subgraph.&lt;ref&gt;Information System on Graph Class Inclusions: [http://wwwteo.informatik.uni-rostock.de/isgci/classes/gc_749.html maximal clique irreducible graphs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709192029/http://wwwteo.informatik.uni-rostock.de/isgci/classes/gc_749.html |date=2007-07-09 }} and [http://wwwteo.informatik.uni-rostock.de/isgci/classes/gc_750.html hereditary maximal clique irreducible graphs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708145819/http://wwwteo.informatik.uni-rostock.de/isgci/classes/gc_750.html |date=2007-07-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hereditary maximal-clique irreducible graphs include [[triangle-free graph]]s, [[bipartite graph]]s, and [[interval graph]]s.

[[Cograph]]s can be characterized as graphs in which every maximal clique intersects every maximal independent set, and in which the same property is true in all induced subgraphs.

== Bounding the number of sets ==

{{Harvtxt|Moon|Moser|1965}} showed that any graph with ''n'' vertices has at most 3&lt;sup&gt;''n''/3&lt;/sup&gt; maximal cliques. Complementarily, any graph with ''n'' vertices also has at most 3&lt;sup&gt;''n''/3&lt;/sup&gt; maximal independent sets. A graph with exactly 3&lt;sup&gt;''n''/3&lt;/sup&gt; maximal independent sets is easy to construct: simply take the disjoint union of ''n''/3 [[cycle graph|triangle graphs]]. Any maximal independent set in this graph is formed by choosing one vertex from each triangle. The complementary graph, with exactly 3&lt;sup&gt;''n''/3&lt;/sup&gt; maximal cliques, is a special type of [[Turán graph]]; because of their connection with Moon and Moser's bound, these graphs are also sometimes called Moon-Moser graphs. Tighter bounds are possible if one limits the size of the maximal independent sets: the number of maximal independent sets of size ''k'' in any ''n''-vertex graph is at most
:&lt;math&gt;\lfloor n/k \rfloor^{k-(n\bmod k)}\lfloor n/k+1 \rfloor^{n\bmod k}.&lt;/math&gt;
The graphs achieving this bound are again Turán graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Byskov|2003}}. For related earlier results see {{Harvtxt|Croitoru|1979}} and {{Harvtxt|Eppstein|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain families of graphs may, however, have much more restrictive bounds on the numbers of maximal independent sets or maximal cliques. If all ''n''-vertex graphs in a family of graphs have O(''n'') edges, and if every subgraph of a graph in the family also belongs to the family, then each graph in the family can have at most O(''n'') maximal cliques, all of which have size O(1).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Chiba|Nishizeki|1985}}. Chiba and Nishizeki express the condition of having O(''n'') edges equivalently, in terms of the [[arboricity]] of the graphs in the family being constant.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, these conditions are true for the [[planar graph]]s: every ''n''-vertex planar graph has at most 3''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;6 edges, and a subgraph of a planar graph is always planar, from which it follows that each planar graph has O(''n'') maximal cliques (of size at most four). [[Interval graph]]s and [[chordal graph]]s also have at most ''n'' maximal cliques, even though they are not always [[sparse graph]]s.

The number of maximal independent sets in ''n''-vertex [[cycle graph]]s is given by the [[Perrin number]]s, and the number of maximal independent sets in ''n''-vertex [[path (graph theory)|path graphs]] is given by the [[Padovan sequence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bisdorff|Marichal|2007}}; {{Harvtxt|Euler|2005}}; {{Harvtxt|Füredi|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, both numbers are proportional to powers of 1.324718, the [[plastic number]].

== Finding a single maximal independent set ==

=== Sequential algorithm ===
Given a Graph G(V,E), it is easy to find a single MIS using the following algorithm:

# Initialize I to an empty set.
# While V is not empty:
#* Choose a node v∈V;
#* Add v to the set I;
#* Remove from V the node v and all its neighbours.
# Return I.

The runtime is O(''m'') since in the worst case as we have to check all edges.

O(m) is obviously the best possible runtime for a serial algorithm. But a parallel algorithm can solve the problem much faster.

=== Random-selection parallel algorithm [Luby's Algorithm] ===
The following algorithm finds a MIS in time O(log ''n'').&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vigoda/RandAlgs/MIS.pdf Luby’s Algorithm, in: Lecture Notes for Randomized Algorithms, Last Updated by Eric Vigoda on February 2, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=luby&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1137/0215074| title = A Simple Parallel Algorithm for the Maximal Independent Set Problem| journal = SIAM Journal on Computing| volume = 15| issue = 4| pages = 1036| year = 1986| last1 = Luby | first1 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lecture7"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dcg.ethz.ch/lectures/podc_allstars/lecture/chapter7.pdf | title=Principles of Distributed Computing (lecture 7) | publisher=ETH Zurich | accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Initialize I to an empty set.
# While V is not empty:
#* Choose a random set of vertices S ⊆ V, by selecting each vertex v independently with probability 1/(2d(v)), where d is the degree of v (the number of neighbours of v).
#* For every edge in E, if both its endpoints are in the random set S, then remove from S the endpoint whose degree is lower (i.e. has fewer neighbours). Break ties arbitrarily, e.g. using a lexicographic order on the vertex names.
#* Add the set S to I.
#* Remove from V the set S and all the neighbours of nodes in S.
# Return I.

'''ANALYSIS''':  For each node v, divide its neighbours to ''lower neighbours'' (whose degree is lower than the degree of v) and ''higher neighbours''  (whose degree is higher than the degree of v), breaking ties as in the algorithm.

Call a node v ''bad'' if more than 2/3 of its neighbors are higher neighbours. Call an edge ''bad'' if both its endpoints are bad; otherwise the edge is ''good''.
* At least 1/2 of all edges are always good. PROOF: Build a directed version of G by directing each edge to the node with the higher degree (breaking ties arbitrarily). So for every bad node, the number of out-going edges is more than 2 times the number of in-coming edges. So every bad edge, that enters a node v, can be matched to a distinct set of two edges that exit the node v. Hence the total number of edges is at least 2 times the number of bad edges.
* For every good node u, the probability that a neighbour of u is selected to S is at least a certain positive constant. PROOF: the probability that NO neighbour of u is selected to S is at most the probability that none of u's ''lower neighbours'' is selected. For each lower-neighbour v, the probability that it is not selected is (1-1/2d(v)), which is at most (1-1/2d(u))  (since d(u)&gt;d(v)). The number of such neighours is at least d(u)/3, since u is good. Hence the probability that no lower-neighbour is selected is at most 1-exp(-1/6).
* For every node u that is selected to S, the probability that u will be removed from S is at most 1/2. PROOF: This probability is at most the probability that a higher-neighbour of u is selected to S. For each higher-neighbour v, the probability that it is selected is at most 1/2d(v), which is at most 1/2d(u) (since d(v)&gt;d(u)). By union bound, the probability that no higher-neighbour is selected is at most d(u)/2d(u) = 1/2.
* Hence, for every good node u, the probability that a neighbour of u is selected to S and remains in S is a certain positive constant. Hence, the probability that u is removed, in each step, is at least a positive constant.
* Hence, for every good edge e, the probability that e is removed, in each step, is at least a positive constant. So the number of good edges drops by at least a constant factor each step.
* Since at least half the edges are good, the total number of edges also drops by a constant factor each step.
* Hence, the number of steps is O(log ''m''), where ''m'' is the number of edges. This is bounded by &lt;math&gt;O(\log(n))&lt;/math&gt;.

A worst-case graph, in which the average number of steps is &lt;math&gt;\Theta(\log(n))&lt;/math&gt;, is a graph made of ''n''/2 connected components, each with 2 nodes. The degree of all nodes is 1, so each node is selected with probability 1/2, and with probability 1/4 both nodes in a component are not chosen. Hence, the number of nodes drops by a factor of 4 each step, and the expected number of steps is &lt;math&gt;\log_4(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Random-priority parallel algorithm ===

The following algorithm is better than the previous one in that at least one new node is always added in each connected component:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00446-010-0121-5| title = An optimal bit complexity randomized distributed MIS algorithm| journal = Distributed Computing| volume = 23| issue = 5–6| pages = 331| year = 2010| last1 = Métivier | first1 = Y.| last2 = Robson | first2 = J. M.| last3 = Saheb-Djahromi | first3 = N.| last4 = Zemmari | first4 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lecture7"/&gt;

# Initialize I to an empty set.
# While V is not empty, each node v does the following:
#* Selects a random number r(v) in [0,1] and sends it to its neighbours;
#* If r(v) is smaller than the numbers of all neighbours of v, then v inserts itself into I, removes itself from V and tells its neighbours about this;
#* If v heard that one of its neighbours got into I, then v removes itself from V.
# Return I.

Note that in every step, the node with the smallest number in each connected component always enters I, so there is always some progress. In particular, in the worst-case of the previous algorithm (''n''/2 connected components with 2 nodes each), a MIS will be found in a single step.

'''ANALYSIS''': 
* A node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; has probability at least &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{d(v)+d(w)}&lt;/math&gt; of being removed. PROOF: For each edge connecting a pair of nodes &lt;math&gt;(v, w)&lt;/math&gt;, replace it with two directed edges, one from &lt;math&gt;(v, w)&lt;/math&gt; and the other &lt;math&gt;(w, v)&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that &lt;math&gt;|E|&lt;/math&gt; is now twice as large. For every pair of directed edges &lt;math&gt;(v, w)&lt;/math&gt;, define two events: &lt;math&gt;(v \rightarrow w)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(w \rightarrow v)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; pre-emptively removes &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; pre-emptively removes &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The event &lt;math&gt;(v \rightarrow w)&lt;/math&gt; occurs when &lt;math&gt;r(v) &lt; r(w)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r(v) &lt; r(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a neighbor of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is neighbor &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;. Recall that each node is given a random number in the same [0, 1] range. In a simple example with two disjoint nodes, each has probability &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; of being smallest. If there are three disjoint nodes, each has probability  &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; of being smallest. In the case of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, it has probability at least  &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{d(v)+d(w)}&lt;/math&gt; of being smallest because it is possible that a neighbor of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is also the neighbor of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, so a node becomes double counted. Using the same logic, the event &lt;math&gt;(w \rightarrow v)&lt;/math&gt; also has probability at least  &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{d(w)+d(v)}&lt;/math&gt; of being removed.
* When the events &lt;math&gt;(v \rightarrow w)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(w \rightarrow v)&lt;/math&gt; occur, they remove &lt;math&gt;d(w)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(v)&lt;/math&gt; directed outgoing edges, respectively. PROOF: In the event  &lt;math&gt;(v \rightarrow w)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is removed, all neighboring nodes &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; are also removed. The number of outgoing directed edges from &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; removed is &lt;math&gt;d(w)&lt;/math&gt;. With the same logic, &lt;math&gt;(w \rightarrow v)&lt;/math&gt; removes &lt;math&gt;d(v)&lt;/math&gt; directed outgoing edges.
* In each iteration of step 2, in expectation, half the edges are removed. PROOF: If the event  &lt;math&gt;(v \rightarrow w)&lt;/math&gt; happens then all neighbours of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; are removed; hence the expected number of edges removed due to this event is at least &lt;math&gt;\frac{d(w)}{d(v)+d(w)}&lt;/math&gt;. The same is true for the reverse event &lt;math&gt;(w \rightarrow v)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the expected number of edges removed is at least &lt;math&gt;\frac{d(v)}{d(w)+d(v)}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, for every undirected edge &lt;math&gt;(w, v)&lt;/math&gt;, the expected number of edges removed due to one of these nodes having smallest value is &lt;math&gt;\frac{d(w)+d(v)}{d(w)+d(v)} = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Summing over all edges, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{{v,w}\in E} 1= |E|&lt;/math&gt;, gives an expected number of &lt;math&gt;|E|&lt;/math&gt; edges removed every step, but each edge is counted twice (once per direction), giving  &lt;math&gt;\frac{|E|}{2}&lt;/math&gt; edges removed in expectation every step.
* Hence, the expected run time of the algorithm is &lt;math&gt;3 \log_{4/3}(m)+1&lt;/math&gt; which is &lt;math&gt;O(\log(n))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="lecture7"/&gt;

=== Random-permutation parallel algorithm [Blelloch's Algorithm] ===

Instead of randomizing in each step, it is possible to randomize once, at the beginning of the algorithm, by fixing a random ordering on the nodes. Given this fixed ordering, the following parallel algorithm achieves exactly the same MIS as the [[#Sequential algorithm]] (i.e. the result is deterministic):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv|eprint=1202.3205|last1=Blelloch|first1=Guy|title=Greedy Sequential Maximal Independent Set and Matching are Parallel on Average|last2=Fineman|first2=Jeremy|last3=Shun|first3=Julian|class=cs.DS|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Initialize I to an empty set.
# While V is not empty:
#* Let W be the set of vertices in V with no earlier neighbours (based on the fixed ordering);
#* Add W to I;
#* Remove from V the nodes in the set W and all their neighbours.
# Return I.

Between the totally sequential and the totally parallel algorithms, there is a continuum of algorithms that are partly sequential and partly parallel. Given a fixed ordering on the nodes and a factor δ∈(0,1], the following algorithm returns the same MIS:

# Initialize I to an empty set.
# While V is not empty:
#* Select a factor δ∈(0,1].
#* Let P be the set of δ''n'' nodes that are first in the fixed ordering.
#* Let W be a MIS on P using the totally parallel algorithm.
#* Add W to I;
#* Remove from V all the nodes in the prefix P, and all the neighbours of nodes in the set W.

Setting δ=1/''n'' gives the totally sequential algorithm; setting δ=1 gives the totally parallel algorithm.

'''ANALYSIS''':  With a proper selection of the parameter δ in the partially parallel algorithm, it is possible to guarantee that the it finishes after at most log(n) calls to the fully parallel algorithm, and the number of steps in each call is at most log(n). Hence the total run-time of the partially parallel algorithm is &lt;math&gt;O(\log^2(n))&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the run-time of the fully parallel algorithm is also at most &lt;math&gt;O(\log^2(n))&lt;/math&gt;. The main proof steps are:
* If, in step ''i'', we select &lt;math&gt;\delta = 2^i \log{(n)} / D&lt;/math&gt;, where ''D'' is the maximum degree of a node in the graph, then [[with high probability|WHP]] all nodes remaining after step ''i'' have degree at most &lt;math&gt;D / 2^i&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, after log(''D'') steps, all remaining nodes have degree 0 (since ''D''&lt;''n''), and can be removed in a single step.
* If, in any step, the degree of each node is at most ''d'', and we select &lt;math&gt;\delta =  C \log{(n)}/d&lt;/math&gt; (for any constant ''C''), then [[with high probability|WHP]] the longest path in the directed graph determined by the fixed ordering has length &lt;math&gt;O(\log(n))&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the fully parallel algorithm takes at most &lt;math&gt;O(\log(n))&lt;/math&gt; steps (since the longest path is a worst-case bound on the number of steps in that algorithm).
* Combining these two facts gives that, if we select &lt;math&gt;\delta = 2^i \log{(n)} / D&lt;/math&gt;, then WHP the run-time of the partially parallel algorithm is &lt;math&gt;O(\log(D)\log(n)) = O(\log^2(n))&lt;/math&gt;.

== Listing all maximal independent sets ==

{{Further|Clique problem#Listing all maximal cliques}}

An algorithm for listing all maximal independent sets or maximal cliques in a graph can be used as a subroutine for solving many NP-complete graph problems. Most obviously, the solutions to the maximum independent set problem, the maximum clique problem, and the minimum independent dominating problem must all be maximal independent sets or maximal cliques, and can be found by an algorithm that lists all maximal independent sets or maximal cliques and retains the ones with the largest or smallest size. Similarly, the [[Vertex cover problem|minimum vertex cover]] can be found as the complement of one of the maximal independent sets. {{Harvtxt|Lawler|1976}} observed that listing maximal independent sets can also be used to find 3-colorings of graphs: a graph can be 3-colored if and only if the [[complement (graph theory)|complement]] of one of its maximal independent sets is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]]. He used this approach not only for 3-coloring but as part of a more general graph coloring algorithm, and similar approaches to graph coloring have been refined by other authors since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Eppstein|2003}}; {{Harvtxt|Byskov|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other more complex problems can also be modeled as finding a clique or independent set of a specific type. This motivates the algorithmic problem of listing all maximal independent sets (or equivalently, all maximal cliques) efficiently.

It is straightforward to turn a proof of Moon and Moser's 3&lt;sup&gt;''n''/3&lt;/sup&gt; bound on the number of maximal independent sets into an algorithm that lists all such sets in time O(3&lt;sup&gt;''n''/3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Eppstein|2003}}. For a matching bound for the widely used [[Bron–Kerbosch algorithm]], see {{harvtxt|Tomita|Tanaka|Takahashi|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For graphs that have the largest possible number of maximal independent sets, this algorithm takes constant time per output set. However, an algorithm with this time bound can be highly inefficient for graphs with more limited numbers of independent sets. For this reason, many researchers have studied algorithms that list all maximal independent sets in polynomial time per output set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bomze|Budinich|Pardalos|Pelillo|1999}}; {{Harvtxt|Eppstein|2005}}; {{Harvtxt|Jennings|Motycková|1992}}; {{Harvtxt|Johnson|Yannakakis|Papadimitriou|1988}}; {{Harvtxt|Lawler|Lenstra|Rinnooy Kan|1980}}; {{Harvtxt|Liang|Dhall|Lakshmivarahan|1991}}; {{Harvtxt|Makino|Uno|2004}}; {{Harvtxt|Mishra|Pitt|1997}}; {{Harvtxt|Stix|2004}}; {{Harvtxt|Tsukiyama|Ide|Ariyoshi|Shirakawa|1977}}; {{Harvtxt|Yu|Chen|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The time per maximal independent set is proportional to that for [[matrix multiplication]] in dense graphs, or faster in various classes of sparse graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Makino|Uno|2004}}; {{Harvtxt|Eppstein|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parallelization of finding maximum independent sets ==

=== History ===
The maximal independent set problem was originally thought to be non-trivial to [[Parallel algorithm|parallelize]] due to the fact that the lexicographical maximal independent set proved to be [[P-complete|P-Complete]]; however, it has been shown that a deterministic parallel solution could be given by an &lt;math&gt;NC^1&lt;/math&gt; reduction from either the [[Set packing|maximum set packing]] or the [[Matching (graph theory)|maximal matching]] problem or by an &lt;math&gt;NC^2&lt;/math&gt; reduction from the [[2-satisfiability]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.jdl.ac.cn/turing/pdf/p400-cook.pdf|title = An overview of computational complexity|last = Cook|first = Stephen|date = June 1983|journal = Commun. ACM|doi = 10.1145/358141.358144|pmid = |access-date =|volume=26|pages=400–408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cglab.ca/~lfbarba/parallel_algorithms/Literature_Review.pdf|title = LITERATURE REVIEW: Parallel algorithms for the maximal independent set problem in graphs|date = October 2012|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Barba|first = Luis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the structure of the algorithm given follows other parallel graph algorithms - that is they subdivide the graph into smaller local problems that are solvable in parallel by running an identical algorithm.

Initial research into the maximal independent set problem started on the [[Parallel random-access machine|PRAM model]] and has since expanded to produce results for [[distributed algorithm]]s on [[computer cluster]]s. The many challenges of designing distributed parallel algorithms apply in equal to the maximum independent set problem. In particular, finding an algorithm that exhibits efficient runtime and is optimal in data communication for subdividing the graph and merging the independent set.

=== Complexity class ===
It was shown in 1984 by Karp et al. that a deterministic parallel solution on PRAM to the maximal independent set belonged in the [[NC (complexity)|Nick’s Class complexity]] zoo of &lt;math&gt;NC_4&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A fast parallel algorithm for the maximal independent set problem|last = Karp|first = R.M.|date = 1984|journal = Proc. 16th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Wigderson|first2 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, their algorithm finds a maximal independent set in &lt;math&gt;O(\log^4n)&lt;/math&gt; using &lt;math&gt;O((n/\log n)^3)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the vertex set size. In the same paper, a randomized parallel solution was also provided with a runtime of &lt;math&gt;O(\log^4n)&lt;/math&gt; using &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; processors. Shortly after, Luby and Alon et al. independently improved on this result, bringing the maximal independent set problem into the realm of &lt;math&gt;NC_2&lt;/math&gt; with an &lt;math&gt;O(\log^2n)&lt;/math&gt; runtime using &lt;math&gt;O(mn^2)&lt;/math&gt; processors, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the number of edges in the graph.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="luby" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A fast and simple randomized parallel algorithm for the maximal independent set problem|last = Alon|first = Noga|date = 1986|journal = Journal of Algorithms|doi = 10.1016/0196-6774(86)90019-2|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Laszlo|first2 = Babai|last3 = Alon|first3 = Itai |volume=7 |pages=567–583}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to show that their algorithm is in &lt;math&gt;NC_2&lt;/math&gt;, they initially presented a randomized algorithm that uses &lt;math&gt;O(m)&lt;/math&gt; processors but could be derandomized with an additional &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; processors. Today, it remains an open question as to if the maximal independent set problem is in &lt;math&gt;NC_1&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Communication and data exchange ===
Distributed maximal independent set algorithms are strongly influenced by algorithms on the PRAM model. The original work by Luby and Alon et al. has led to several distributed algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Distributed computing—A Locality-sensitive approach|last = Peleg|first = D.|date = 2000|journal = SIAM Monographs on Discrete Mathematics and Applications|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Distributed Algorithms|last = Lynch|first = N.A.|date = 1996|journal = [[Morgan Kaufmann]]|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dcg.ethz.ch/lectures/fs08/distcomp/lecture/chapter4.pdf|title = Chapter 4: Maximal Independent Set|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Wattenhofer|first = R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In terms of exchange of bits, these algorithms had a message size lower bound per round of &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; bits and would require additional characteristics of the graph. For example, the size of the graph would need to be known or the maximum degree of neighboring vertices for a given vertex could be queried. In 2010, Métivier et al. reduced the required message size per round to &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, which is optimal and removed the need for any additional graph knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = An optimal bit complexity randomized distributed MIS algorithm|last = Métivier|first = Y.|date = 2010|journal = Distributed Computing|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Robson|first2 = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10682">{{for|the minimal polynomial of an algebraic element of a field|Minimal polynomial (field theory)}}

In [[linear algebra]], the '''minimal polynomial''' {{math|''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of an {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] {{mvar|A}} over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|'''F'''}} is the [[monic polynomial]] {{mvar|P}} over {{math|'''F'''}} of least degree such that {{math|''P''(''A'') {{=}} 0}}.  Any other polynomial {{mvar|Q}} with {{math|''Q''(''A'') {{=}} 0}} is a (polynomial) multiple of {{math|''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

The following three statements are equivalent:
# {{mvar|λ}} is a root of {{math|''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''}},
# {{mvar|λ}} is a root of the [[characteristic polynomial]] {{math|''χ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of {{mvar|A}},
# {{mvar|λ}} is an [[eigenvalue]] of matrix {{mvar|A}}.

The multiplicity of a root {{mvar|λ}} of {{math|''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the largest power {{mvar|m}} such that {{math|Ker((''A'' − ''λI&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} ''strictly'' contains {{math|Ker((''A'' − ''λI&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sup&gt;''m''−1&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. In other words, increasing the exponent up to {{mvar|m}} will give ever larger kernels, but further increasing the exponent beyond {{mvar|m}} will just give the same kernel.

If the field {{math|'''F'''}} is not algebraically closed, then the minimal and characteristic polynomials need not factor according to their roots (in {{math|'''F'''}}) alone, in other words they may have [[irreducible polynomial]] factors of degree greater than {{math|1}}. For irreducible polynomials {{mvar|P}} one has similar equivalences:
# {{mvar|P}} divides {{math|''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''}},
# {{mvar|P}} divides {{math|''χ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''}},
# the kernel of {{math|''P''(''A'')}} has dimension at least {{math|1}}.
# the kernel of {{math|''P''(''A'')}} has dimension at least {{math|deg(''P'')}}.

Like the characteristic polynomial, the minimal polynomial does not depend on the base field, in other words considering the matrix as one with coefficients in a larger field does not change the minimal polynomial. The reason is somewhat different from for the characteristic polynomial (where it is immediate from the definition of determinants), namely the fact that the minimal polynomial is determined by the relations of [[linear dependence]] between the powers of {{mvar|A}}: extending the base field will not introduce any new such relations (nor of course will it remove existing ones).

The minimal polynomial is often the same as the characteristic polynomial, but not always. For example, if {{mvar|A}} is a multiple {{math|''aI&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of the identity matrix, then its minimal polynomial is {{math|''X'' − ''a''}} since the kernel of {{math|''aI&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''A'' {{=}} 0}} is already the entire space; on the other hand its characteristic polynomial is {{math|(''X'' − ''a'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} (the only eigenvalue is {{mvar|a}}, and the degree of the characteristic polynomial is always equal to the dimension of the space). The minimal polynomial always divides the characteristic polynomial, which is one way of formulating the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]] (for the case of matrices over a field).

== Formal definition ==
Given an [[endomorphism]] {{mvar|T}} on a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] {{mvar|V}} over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|'''F'''}}, let {{math|''I&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be the set defined as 

:&lt;math&gt; \mathit{I}_T = \{ p \in \mathbf{F}[t] \; | \; p(T) = 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''F'''[''t'']}} is the space of all polynomials over the field {{math|'''F'''}}. {{math|''I&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is a [[Ideal (ring theory)|proper ideal]] of {{math|'''F'''[''t'']}}. Since {{math|'''F'''}} is a field, {{math|'''F'''[''t'']}} is a [[principal ideal domain]], thus any ideal is generated by a single polynomial, which is unique up to units in {{math|'''F'''}}. A particular choice among the generators can be made, since precisely one of the generators is [[monic polynomial|monic]]. The '''minimal polynomial''' is thus defined to be the monic polynomial which generates {{math|''I&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. It is the monic polynomial of least degree in {{math|''I&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

== Applications ==
An [[endomorphism]] {{mvar|φ}} of a finite dimensional vector space over a field {{math|'''F'''}} is [[diagonalizable]] if and only if its minimal polynomial factors completely over {{math|'''F'''}} into ''distinct'' linear factors. The fact that there is only one factor {{math|''X'' − ''λ''}} for every eigenvalue {{mvar|λ}} means that the [[generalized eigenspace]] for {{mvar|λ}} is the same as the [[eigenspace]] for {{mvar|λ}}: every Jordan block has size {{math|1}}. More generally, if {{mvar|φ}} satisfies a polynomial equation {{math|''P''(''φ'') {{=}} 0}} where {{mvar|P}} factors into distinct linear factors over {{math|'''F'''}}, then it will be diagonalizable: its minimal polynomial is a divisor of {{mvar|P}} and therefore also factors into distinct linear factors. In particular one has:

* {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''X&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' − 1}}: finite order endomorphisms of complex vector spaces are diagonalizable. For the special case {{math|''k'' {{=}} 2}} of [[involution (mathematics)|involutions]], this is even true for endomorphisms of vector spaces over any field of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] other than {{math|2}}, since {{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 {{=}} (''X'' − 1)(''X'' + 1)}} is a factorization into distinct factors over such a field. This is a part of [[representation theory]] of cyclic groups.
* {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''X''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''X'' {{=}} ''X''(''X'' − 1)}}: endomorphisms satisfying {{math|''φ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''φ''}} are called [[Projection (linear algebra)|projections]], and are always diagonalizable (moreover their only eigenvalues are {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}).
* By contrast if {{math|''μ&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''X&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k&lt;/sup&gt;''}}  with {{math|''k'' ≥ 2}} then {{mvar|φ}} (a nilpotent endomorphism) is not necessarily diagonalizable, since {{math|''X&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k&lt;/sup&gt;''}} has a repeated root {{math|0}}.

These cases can also be proved directly, but the minimal polynomial gives a unified perspective and proof.

== Computation ==
For a vector {{mvar|v}} in {{mvar|V}} define:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathit{I}_{T, v} = \{ p \in \mathbf{F}[t] \; | \; p(T)(v) = 0 \}.&lt;/math&gt;

This definition satisfies the properties of a proper ideal. Let {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''v''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the monic polynomial which generates it.

===Properties===
{{unordered list
|1= Since {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''v''&lt;/sub&gt;}} contains the minimal polynomial {{math|''μ&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the latter is divisible by {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''v''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
|2= If {{mvar|d}} is the least natural number such that {{math|''v'', ''T''(''v''), ..., ''T&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;''(''v'')}} are [[linearly dependent]], then there exist unique {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''d''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{math|'''F'''}}, not all zero, such that
:&lt;math&gt; a_0 v + a_1 T(v) + \cdots + a_{d-1} T^{d-1} (v) + T^d (v) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
and for these coefficients one has
:&lt;math&gt; \mu_{T,v} (t) = a_0  + a_1 t + \ldots + a_{d-1} t^{d-1} + t^d. &lt;/math&gt;
|3= Let the subspace ''W'' be the image of {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''v''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')}}, which is {{mvar|T}}-stable. Since {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''v''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')}} annihilates at least the vectors {{math|''v'', ''T''(''v''), ..., ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''d''-1&lt;/sup&gt;(''v'')}}, the [[codimension]] of {{mvar|W}} is at least {{mvar|d}}.
|4= The minimal polynomial {{math|''μ&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the product of {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''v''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the minimal polynomial {{mvar|Q}} of the restriction of {{mvar|T}} to {{mvar|W}}. In the (likely) case that {{mvar|W}} has dimension {{math|0}} one has {{math|''Q'' {{=}} 1}} and therefore {{math|''μ&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''v''&lt;/sub&gt;}}; otherwise a recursive computation of {{mvar|Q}} suffices to find {{math|''μ&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.
}}

=== Example ===
Define {{mvar|T}} to be the endomorphism of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} with matrix, on the canonical basis,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -3 \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the first canonical basis vector {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and its repeated images by {{mvar|T}} one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;  e_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
  T\cdot e_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}. \quad
T^2\cdot e_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \mbox{ and}\quad
T^3\cdot e_1=\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

of which the first three are easily seen to be [[linearly independent]], and therefore span all of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The last one then necessarily is a linear combination of the first three, in fact

:{{math|''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;3&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −4''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''T''⋅''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, 

so that: 

:{{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''X''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 4''X''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''X'' − ''I''}}.

This is in fact also the minimal polynomial {{math|''μ&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and the characteristic polynomial {{math|''χ&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''}}: indeed {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} divides {{math|''μ&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''}} which divides {{math|''χ&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and since the first and last are of degree {{math|3}} and all are monic, they must all be the same. Another reason is that in general if any polynomial in {{mvar|T}} annihilates a vector {{mvar|v}}, then it also annihilates {{math|''T''⋅''v''}} (just apply {{mvar|T}} to the equation that says that it annihilates {{mvar|v}}), and therefore by iteration it annihilates the entire space generated by the iterated images by {{mvar|T}} of {{mvar|v}}; in the current case we have seen that for {{math|''v'' {{=}} ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} that space is all of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, so {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''T'',''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') {{=}} 0}}. Indeed one verifies for the full matrix that {{math|''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 4''T''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''T'' − ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the null matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -3 \\ 3 &amp; -13 &amp; 23 \\ -4 &amp; 19 &amp; -36 \end{bmatrix}
 +4\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 4 &amp; -6 \\ 1 &amp; -5 &amp; 10 \end{bmatrix}
 +\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -3 \end{bmatrix}
 +\begin{bmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}
 =\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

{{Software development process}}
'''Model-driven engineering''' ('''MDE''') is a [[software development methodology]] that focuses on creating and exploiting [[domain model]]s, which are conceptual models of all the topics related to a specific problem. Hence, it highlights and aims at [[Representation (mathematics)|abstract representations]] of the [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge]] and activities that govern a particular [[problem domain|application domain]], rather than the computing (i.e. algorithmic) concepts.

== Overview ==
The MDE approach is meant to increase productivity by maximizing compatibility between systems (via reuse of standardized models), simplifying the process of design (via models of recurring [[design patterns]] in the application domain), and promoting communication between individuals and teams working on the system (via a standardization of the terminology and the [[best practice]]s used in the application domain).

A modeling paradigm for MDE is considered effective if its models make sense from the point of view of a user that is familiar with the domain, and if they can serve as a basis for implementing systems. The models are developed through extensive communication among product managers, designers, developers and users of the application domain. As the models approach completion, they enable the development of software and systems.

Some of the better known MDE initiatives are:
* The [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) initiative [[Model-Driven Architecture]] (MDA) which is leveraged by several of their standards such as [[Meta-Object Facility]], [[XML Metadata Interchange|XMI]], [[Common Warehouse Metamodel|CWM]], [[CORBA]], [[Unified Modeling Language]] (to be more precise, the OMG currently promotes the use of a subset of UML called [[Executable UML#fUML and ALF|fUML]] together with its action language, [[Executable UML#fUML and ALF|ALF]], for model-driven architecture; a former approach relied on Executable UML and [[Object Constraint Language|OCL]], instead), and [[QVT]].&lt;ref name="omgtm"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Object Management Group]]|title=OMG Trademarks|url=http://www.omg.org/legal/tm_list.htm|accessdate=2008-02-26|date=2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] "eco-system" of programming and modelling tools represented in general terms by the ([[Eclipse Modeling Framework]]). This framework allows the creation of tools implementing the MDA standards of the OMG; but, it is also possible to use it to implement other modeling-related tools.

== History ==
The first tools to support MDE were the Computer-Aided Software Engineering ([[Computer Aided Software Engineering|CASE]]) tools developed in the 1980s. Companies like Integrated Development Environments (IDE - StP), Higher Order Software (now Hamilton Technologies, Inc., HTI), Cadre Technologies, [[Charles Bachman#Bachman Information Systems|Bachman Information Systems]], and [[Logic Works]] (BP-Win and ER-Win) were pioneers in the field.

The US government got involved in the modeling definitions creating the [[IDEF]] specifications. With several variations of the modeling definitions (see [[Booch method|Booch]], [[Object-modeling technique|Rumbaugh]], [[Object-oriented software engineering|Jacobson]], Gane and Sarson, [[State diagram#Harel statechart|Harel]], [[Shlaer-Mellor|Shlaer and Mellor]], and others) they were eventually joined creating the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML). [[Rational Rose]], a product for UML implementation, was done by Rational Corporation (Booch) responding automation yield higher levels of abstraction in software development. This abstraction promotes simpler models with a greater focus on problem space. Combined with executable semantics this elevates the total level of automation possible. The [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) has developed a set of standards called [[model-driven architecture]] (MDA), building a foundation for this advanced architecture-focused approach.

According to [[Douglas C. Schmidt]], model-driven engineering technologies offer a promising approach to address the inability of third-generation languages to alleviate the complexity of platforms and express domain concepts effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=D.C.|title=Model-Driven Engineering|journal=[[IEEE Computer]]|volume=39|issue=2|date=February 2006|url=http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/GEI.pdf|accessdate=2006-05-16}}, ''"A promising approach to address platform complexity&amp;mdash;and the inability of third-generation languages to alleviate this complexity and express domain concepts effectively&amp;mdash;is to develop Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) technologies..."''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5235">In mathematics, a '''monotonically normal space''' is a particular kind of [[normal space]], with some special characteristics, and is such that it is hereditarily normal, and any two separated subsets are strongly separated. They are defined in terms of a monotone normality operator.

A &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal T)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''monotonically normal'' if the following condition holds:

For every &lt;math&gt;x\in G&lt;/math&gt;, where G is open, there is an open set &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)&lt;/math&gt; such that
#&lt;math&gt;x\in\mu(x,G)\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt;
#if &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)\cap\mu(y,H)\neq\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; then either &lt;math&gt;x\in H&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y\in G&lt;/math&gt;.

There are some equivalent criteria of monotone normality.

==Equivalent definitions==
===Definition 2===

A space X is called monotonically normal if it is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; and for each pair of disjoint closed subsets &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; there is an open set &lt;math&gt;G(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; with the properties

# &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq G(A,B)\subseteq G(A,B)^{-}\subseteq X\backslash B&lt;/math&gt; and
# &lt;math&gt;G(A,B)\subseteq G(A',B')&lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq A'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B ' \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;. 

This operator &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is called '''monotone normality operator'''. 

Note that if G is a monotone normality operator, then &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\tilde G(A,B)=G(A,B)\backslash G(B,A)^{-}&lt;/math&gt; is also a monotone normality operator; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; satisfies 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \tilde G(A,B)\cap \tilde G(B,A)=\emptyset
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For this reason we some time take the monotone normality operator so as to satisfy the above requirement; and that facilitates the proof of some theorems and of the equivalence of the definitions as well.

===Definition 3===

A space X is called monotonically normal if it is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;,and to each pair (A, B) of subsets of X, with &lt;math&gt;A\cap B^{-}=\emptyset=B\cap A^{-}&lt;/math&gt;, one can assign an open subset G(A, B) of X such that
# &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq G ( A , B) \subseteq G ( A , B)^{-}\subseteq X\backslash B,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;G(A, B) \subseteq G(A', B') \mbox{ whenever }A \subseteq A' \mbox{ and } B'\subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;.

===Definition 4===

A space X is called monotonically normal if it is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; and there is a function H that assigns to each ordered pair (p,C) where C is closed and p is without C, an open set H(p,C) satisfying:
# &lt;math&gt;p\in H(p,C)\subseteq X\backslash C&lt;/math&gt;
# if D is closed and &lt;math&gt;p\not\in C\supseteq D&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;H(p,C)\subseteq H(p,D)&lt;/math&gt;
# if &lt;math&gt;p\neq q&lt;/math&gt; are points in X, then &lt;math&gt;H(p,\{q\})\cap H(q,\{p\})=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==
An important example of these spaces would be, assuming Axiom of Choice, the linearly ordered spaces; however, it really needs [[axiom of choice]] for an arbitrary linear order to be [[normal space|normal]] (see van Douwen's paper). Any [[generalised metric]] is monotonically normal even without choice. An important property of monotonically normal spaces is that any two separated subsets are strongly separated there. Monotone normality is hereditary property and a monotonically normal space is always normal by the first condition of the second equivalent definition.

We list up some of the properties :
# A [[closed map]] preserves monotone normality. 
# A monotonically normal space is hereditarily [[collectionwise normal]].
# Elastic spaces are monotonically normal.

'''PGF/Ti''k''Z''' is a pair of languages for producing [[vector graphics]] from a geometric/algebraic description. PGF is a lower-level language, while Ti''k''Z is a set of higher-level macros that use PGF. The top-level PGF and Ti''k''Z commands are invoked as TeX macros, but in contrast with [[PSTricks]], the PGF/Ti''k''Z graphics themselves are described in a language that resembles [[MetaPost]]. [[Till Tantau]] is the designer of these languages, and he is also the main developer of the only known interpreter for PGF and Ti''k''Z, which is written in [[TeX]]. PGF is an acronym for "Portable Graphics Format". Ti''k''Z was introduced in version 0.95 of PGF, and it is a [[recursive acronym]] for "Ti''k''Z ist ''kein'' Zeichenprogramm" (German for "Ti''k''Z is ''not'' a drawing program").

The PGF/Ti''k''Z interpreter can be used from the popular [[LaTeX]] and [[ConTeXt]] macro packages, and also directly from the original [[TeX]]. Since TeX itself is not concerned with graphics, the interpreter supports multiple TeX output backends: [[dvips]], [[dvipdfm]]/[[dvipdfmx]]/[[XeTeX|xdvipdfmx]], [[TeX4ht]], and [[pdftex]]'s internal [[PDF]] output driver. Unlike PSTricks, PGF can thus directly produce either [[PostScript]] or PDF output, but it cannot use some of the more advanced PostScript programming features that PSTricks can use due to the "least common denominator" effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|page=17|title=The Tik Z and PGF Packages: Manual for version 2.10|url=http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pgf/base/doc/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf|format=PDF|author=Till Tantau|date=20 February 2008|accessdate=6 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109090729/http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pgf/base/doc/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf|archivedate=9 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PGF/Ti''k''Z comes with extensive documentation. The version 3.0.0 manual has 1165 pages.

The standard LaTeX &lt;code&gt;picture&lt;/code&gt; environment can also be used as a front end for PGF merely by using the &lt;code&gt;pgfpict2e&lt;/code&gt; package.

Several graphical editors can produce output for PGF/Ti''k''Z like the [[KDE]] program [[Cirkuit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wwwu.uni-klu.ac.at/magostin/cirkuit.html | title = Cirkuit | first = Matteo | last =  Agostinelli }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the math drawing program [[GeoGebra]]. Export to Ti''k''Z is also available as extensions for [[Inkscape]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = https://github.com/kjellmf/svg2tikz| title = Inkscape to TikZ exporter }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blender (software)|Blender]],&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/kjellmf/blend2tikz&lt;/ref&gt; [[MATLAB]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22022 | title = matlab2tikz | first = Nico | last = Schlömer }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[matplotlib]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://github.com/nschloe/matplotlib2tikz | title = matplotlib2tikz | first = Nico | last = Schlömer }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gnuplot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.gnuplot.info/docs_5.2/Gnuplot_5.2.pdf | format = PDF | title = gnuplot 5.2: An Interactive Plotting Program | editor1-first = Thomas | editor1-last = Williams | editor2-first = Colin | editor2-last =  Kelley | year = 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[R (programming language)|R]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cran.r-project.org/package=tikzDevice | title = tikzDevice: R Graphics Output in LaTeX Format }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19954">[[Image:Ptolemy equality.svg|right|thumb|Ptolemy's theorem is a relation among these lengths in a cyclic quadrilateral.]]
In [[Euclidean geometry]], '''Ptolemy's theorem''' is a relation between the four sides and two diagonals of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]] (a quadrilateral whose [[Vertex (geometry)#Of a polytope|vertices]] lie on a common circle). The theorem is named after the [[Roman Greece|Greek]] [[astronomy|astronomer]] and [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[Ptolemy]] (Claudius Ptolemaeus).&lt;ref&gt;C. Ptolemy, [[Almagest]], Book 1, Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy used the theorem as an aid to creating [[Ptolemy's table of chords|his table of chords]], a trigonometric table that he applied to astronomy.

If the vertices of the cyclic quadrilateral are ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' in order, then the theorem states that:

: &lt;math&gt;|\overline{AC}|\cdot |\overline{BD}|=|\overline{AB}|\cdot |\overline{CD}|+|\overline{BC}|\cdot |\overline{AD}|&lt;/math&gt;

where the vertical lines denote the lengths of the line segments between the named vertices. In the context of geometry, the above equality is often simply written as

: AC·BD=AB·CD+BC·AD.

This relation may be verbally expressed as follows:

:''If a quadrilateral is inscribable in a circle then the product of the measures of its diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of the measures of the pairs of opposite sides.''

Moreover, the [[Theorem#Converse|converse]] of Ptolemy's theorem is also true:

:''In a quadrilateral, if the sum of the products of its two pairs of opposite sides is equal to the product of its diagonals, then the quadrilateral can be inscribed in a circle.''

==Examples==

===Equilateral triangle===
[[Image:Ptolemy Equilateral.svg|right|thumb|Equilateral triangle]]

Ptolemy's Theorem yields as a corollary a pretty theorem&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;[http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emt725/Ptolemy/Ptolemy.html Wilson, Jim. "Ptolemy's Theorem."] link verified 2009-04-08&lt;/ref&gt; regarding an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle.

'''Given''' An equilateral triangle inscribed on a circle and a point on the circle.

The distance from the point to the most distant vertex of the triangle is the sum of the distances from the point to the two nearer vertices.

'''Proof:''' Follows immediately from Ptolemy's theorem:

:&lt;math&gt;
qs=ps+rs\Rightarrow q=p+r.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Square===

Any [[Square (geometry)|square]] can be inscribed in a circle whose center is the center of the square. If the common length of its four sides is equal to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; then the length of the diagonal is equal to &lt;math&gt;a\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; according to the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and the relation obviously holds.

===Rectangle===
[[Image:Ptolemy Rectangle.svg|right|thumb|Pythagoras's theorem: ''"manifestum est"'': Copernicus]]
More generally, if the quadrilateral is a [[rectangle]] with sides a and b and diagonal d then Ptolemy's theorem reduces to the Pythagorean theorem. In this case the center of the circle coincides with the point of intersection of the diagonals. The product of the diagonals is then d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the right hand side of Ptolemy's relation is the sum ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Copernicus – who used Ptolemy's theorem extensively in his trigonometrical work – refers to this result as a 'Porism' or self-evident corollary:

:''Furthermore it is clear ('''manifestum est''') that when the chord subtending an arc has been given, that chord too can be found which subtends the rest of the semicircle.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1543droc.book.....C&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=36&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium: Page 37]. See last two lines of this page. Copernicus refers to Ptolemy's theorem as [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1543droc.book.....C&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=37&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES "Theorema Secundum".]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pentagon===
[[Image:Ptolemy Pentagon.svg|right|thumb|The [[golden ratio]] follows from this application of Ptolemy's theorem]]
A more interesting example is the relation between the length ''a'' of the side and the (common) length ''b'' of the 5 chords in a regular pentagon. In this case the relation reads ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ab'' which yields the [[golden ratio]]
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = {b \over a} = {{1+\sqrt{5}}\over 2}.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookXIII/propXIII8.html Proposition 8] in Book XIII of [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/Euclid.html Euclid's Elements] proves by similar triangles the same result: namely that length a (the side of the pentagon) divides length b (joining alternate vertices of the pentagon) in "mean and extreme ratio".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Side of decagon===
[[Image:Ptolemy Pentagon2.svg|right|thumb|Side of the inscribed decagon]]
If now diameter AF is drawn bisecting DC so that DF and CF are sides c of an inscribed decagon, Ptolemy's Theorem can again be applied – this time to cyclic quadrilateral ADFC with diameter ''d'' as one of its diagonals:

:&lt;math&gt;ad=2bc&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow ad=2\varphi ac&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the golden ratio.
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow c=\frac{d}{2\varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;And in analogous fashion [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookXIII/propXIII9.html Proposition 9] in Book XIII of [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/Euclid.html Euclid's Elements] proves by similar triangles that length c (the side of the decagon) divides the radius in "mean and extreme ratio".&lt;/ref&gt;

whence the side of the inscribed decagon is obtained in terms of the circle diameter. Pythagoras's theorem applied to right triangle AFD then yields "b" in terms of the diameter and "a" the side of the pentagon &lt;ref&gt;An interesting article on the construction of a regular pentagon and determination of side length can be found at the following reference [http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/pentagon.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; is thereafter calculated as
::&lt;math&gt;a=\frac {b} {\varphi}=b(\varphi-1).&lt;/math&gt;

As [[Copernicus]] (following Ptolemy) wrote,

:''"The diameter of a circle being given, the sides of the triangle, tetragon, pentagon, hexagon and decagon, which the same circle circumscribes, are also given."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1543droc.book.....C&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=36&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium: Liber Primus: Theorema Primum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proofs==
{{Further |Proofs of trigonometric identities}}
=== Proof by similarity of triangles ===
[[Image:Ptolemy's theorem.svg|thumb|400px|Constructions for a proof of Ptolemy's theorem]]
Let ABCD be a [[cyclic quadrilateral]].
On the [[chord (geometry)|chord]] BC, the [[inscribed angle]]s ∠BAC = ∠BDC, and on AB, ∠ADB = ∠ACB.
Construct K on AC such that ∠ABK = ∠CBD; since ∠ABK + ∠CBK = ∠ABC = ∠CBD + ∠ABD, ∠CBK = ∠ABD.

Now, by common angles △ABK is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to △DBC, and likewise △ABD is similar △KBC.
Thus AK/AB = CD/BD, and CK/BC = DA/BD;
equivalently, AK·BD = AB·CD, and CK·BD = BC·DA.
By adding two equalities we have AK·BD + CK·BD = AB·CD + BC·DA, and factorizing this gives (AK+CK)·BD = AB·CD + BC·DA.
But AK+CK = AC, so AC·BD = AB·CD + BC·DA, [[Q.E.D.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Charming Proofs: A Journey Into Elegant Mathematics|volume=42|series=Dolciani Mathematical Expositions|first1=Claudi|last1=Alsina|first2=Roger B.|last2=Nelsen|publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]]|year=2010|isbn=9780883853481|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mIT5-BN_L0oC&amp;pg=PA112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof as written is only valid for [[simple polygon|simple]] cyclic quadrilaterals. If the quadrilateral is self-crossing then K will be located outside the line segment AC. But in this case, AK&amp;minus;CK=±AC, giving the expected result.

=== Proof by trigonometric identities ===
Let the inscribed angles subtended by &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;CD&lt;/math&gt; be, respectively, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, and the radius of the circle be &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, then we have &lt;math&gt;AB=2R\sin\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;BC=2R\sin\beta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;CD=2R\sin\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;AD=2R\sin(180-(\alpha+\beta+\gamma))&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;AC=2R\sin(\alpha+\beta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;BD=2R\sin(\beta+\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;, and the original equality to be proved is transformed to

:&lt;math&gt; \sin(\alpha+\beta)\sin(\beta+\gamma) = \sin\alpha\sin\gamma + \sin\beta \sin(\alpha + \beta+\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;

from which the factor &lt;math&gt;4R^2&lt;/math&gt; has disappeared by dividing both sides of the equation by it.

Now by using the sum formulae, &lt;math&gt;\sin(x+y)=\sin{x}\cos y+\cos x\sin y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cos(x+y)=\cos x\cos y-\sin x\sin y&lt;/math&gt;, it is trivial to show that both sides of the above equation are equal to

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \sin\alpha\sin\beta\cos\beta\cos\gamma + \sin\alpha\cos^2\beta\sin\gamma \\ + {} &amp; \cos\alpha\sin^2\beta\cos\gamma+\cos\alpha\sin\beta\cos\beta\sin\gamma.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Q.E.D.]]

=== Proof by inversion ===
[[File:Ptolemy-crop.svg|thumb|right|200px|Proof of Ptolemy's theorem via [[circle inversion]]]]

Choose an auxiliary circle &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; centered at D with respect to which the circumcircle of ABCD is [[Inversive_geometry#Circle_inversion|inverted]] into a line (see figure).
Then
&lt;math&gt; A'B' + B'C' = A'C'. &lt;/math&gt;
Without loss of generality &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; has radius &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; A'B', B'C' &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; A'C' &lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as 
&lt;math&gt; \frac{AB}{DA \cdot DB}, \frac{BC}{DB \cdot DC}, \frac{AC}{DA \cdot DC} &lt;/math&gt; respectively. Multiplying previous relation by &lt;math&gt; DA \cdot DB \cdot DC &lt;/math&gt; yields Ptolemy's equality.

[[Q.E.D.]]

==Corollaries==
[[File:Ptolemy theore trig2 proof.svg|thumb|&lt;math&gt;|S_1|=\sin(\theta_1)&lt;/math&gt;]]
[[File:Ptolemy theore trig3.svg|thumb|Corollary 1: Pythagoras's theorem]]

In the case of a circle of unit diameter the sides &lt;math&gt;S_1,S_2,S_3,S_4&lt;/math&gt; of any cyclic quadrilateral ABCD are numerically equal to the sines of the angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_4&lt;/math&gt; which they subtend. Similarly the diagonals are equal to the sine of the sum of whichever '''pair''' of angles they subtend. We may then write Ptolemy's Theorem in the following trigonometric form:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta_1\sin\theta_3+\sin\theta_2\sin\theta_4=\sin(\theta_3+\theta_2)\sin(\theta_1+\theta_2)&lt;/math&gt;

Applying certain conditions to the subtended angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_4&lt;/math&gt; it is possible to derive a number of important corollaries using the above as our starting point. In what follows it is important to bear in mind that the sum of angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_1+\theta_2+\theta_3+\theta_4=180^\circ&lt;/math&gt;.

===Corollary 1. Pythagoras's theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;\theta_1=\theta_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_2=\theta_4&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\theta_1+\theta_2=\theta_3+\theta_4=90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
(since opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary). Then:&lt;ref&gt;In [[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium]], [[Copernicus]] does not refer to Pythagoras's theorem by name but uses the term 'Porism' – a word which in this particular context would appear to denote an observation on – or obvious consequence of – another existing theorem. The 'Porism' can be viewed on pages [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1543droc.book.....C&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=36&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES 36 and 37] of DROC (Harvard electronic copy)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta_1\sin\theta_3+\sin\theta_2\sin\theta_4=\sin(\theta_3+\theta_2)\sin(\theta_3+\theta_4) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sin^2\theta_1+\sin^2\theta_2=\sin^2(\theta_1+\theta_2) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sin^2\theta_1+\cos^2\theta_1=1 &lt;/math&gt;

===Corollary 2. The law of cosines===
[[File:Ptolemy theore trig4.svg|thumb|Corollary 2: the law of cosines]]

Let &lt;math&gt;\theta_2=\theta_4&lt;/math&gt;. The rectangle of corollary 1 is now a symmetrical trapezium with equal diagonals and a pair of equal sides. The parallel sides differ in length by &lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt; units where:
:&lt;math&gt;x=S_2\cos(\theta_2+\theta_3)&lt;/math&gt;

It will be easier in this case to revert to the standard statement of Ptolemy's theorem:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}\\
S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_4={\overline{AC}}\cdot{\overline{BD}}\\
\Rightarrow S_1 S_3+{S_2}^2={\overline{AC}}^2\\
\Rightarrow S_1[S_1-2{S_2}\cos(\theta_2+\theta_3)]+{S_2}^2={\overline{AC}}^2\\
\Rightarrow {S_1}^2+{S_2}^2-2{S_1}{S_2}\cos(\theta_2+\theta_3)={\overline{AC}}^2\\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

The cosine rule for triangle ABC.

===Corollary 3. Compound angle sine (+)===
Let

&lt;math&gt;\theta_1+\theta_2=\theta_3+\theta_4=90^\circ. &lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;
\sin\theta_1\sin\theta_3+\sin\theta_2\sin\theta_4=\sin(\theta_3+\theta_2)\sin(\theta_3+\theta_4)

Despite lacking the dexterity of our modern trigonometric notation, it should be clear from the above corollaries that in Ptolemy's theorem (or more simply the [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1543droc.book.....C&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=37&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES Second Theorem]) the ancient world had at its disposal an extremely flexible and powerful trigonometric tool which enabled the cognoscenti of those times to draw up accurate tables of chords (corresponding to tables of sines) and to use these in their attempts to understand and map the cosmos as they saw it. Since tables of chords were drawn up by [[Hipparchus]] three centuries before Ptolemy, we must assume he knew of the 'Second Theorem' and its derivatives. Following the trail of ancient astronomers, history records the star catalogue of [[Timocharis]] of Alexandria. If, as seems likely, the compilation of such catalogues required an understanding of the 'Second Theorem' then the true origins of the latter disappear thereafter into the mists of antiquity but it cannot be unreasonable to presume that the astronomers, architects and construction engineers of ancient Egypt may have had some knowledge of it.

==Ptolemy's inequality==
{{main|Ptolemy's inequality}}
[[Image:Ptolemy Inequality.svg|thumb|This is ''not'' a cyclic quadrilateral. The equality never holds here, and is unequal in the direction indicated by Ptolemy's inequality.]]

The equation in Ptolemy's theorem is never true with non-cyclic quadrilaterals. [[Ptolemy's inequality]] is an extension of this fact, and it is a more general form of Ptolemy's theorem. It states that, given a quadrilateral ''ABCD'', then

: &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}\cdot \overline{CD}+\overline{BC}\cdot \overline{DA} \ge \overline{AC}\cdot \overline{BD}&lt;/math&gt;

where equality holds if and only if the quadrilateral is [[cyclic quadrilateral|cyclic]]. This special case is equivalent to Ptolemy's theorem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2063">In [[mathematics]], the notion of a '''quasi-continuous function''' is similar to, but weaker than, the notion of a [[continuous function]].  All continuous functions are quasi-continuous but the converse is not true in general.

==Definition==

Let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be a [[topological space]].  A real-valued function &lt;math&gt; f:X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; is quasi-continuous at a point &lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt; if for any every &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; and any [[open neighborhood]] &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; there is a non-empty [[open set]] &lt;math&gt; G \subset U &lt;/math&gt; such that

: &lt;math&gt;  |f(x) - f(y)| &lt; \epsilon \;\;\;\; \forall y \in G &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the above definition, it is not necessary that &lt;math&gt; x \in G &lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==

* If &lt;math&gt; f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; is continuous then &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; is quasi-continuous
* If &lt;math&gt; f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; is continuous and &lt;math&gt; g: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; is quasi-continuous, then &lt;math&gt; f+g &lt;/math&gt; is quasi-continuous.

==Example==

Consider the function &lt;math&gt; f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt; x \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt; x &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;.  Clearly f is continuous everywhere except at x=0, thus quasi-continuous everywhere except at x=0.  At x=0, take any open neighborhood U of x.  Then there exists an open set &lt;math&gt; G \subset U &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; y &lt; 0 \; \forall y \in G &lt;/math&gt;.  Clearly this yields  &lt;math&gt; |f(0) - f(y)| = 0  \; \forall y \in G&lt;/math&gt; thus f is quasi-continuous.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4007">In mathematical [[general relativity]], the '''Penrose inequality''', first conjectured by Sir [[Roger Penrose]], estimates the mass of a [[spacetime]] in terms of the total area of its [[black holes]] and is a generalization of the [[positive mass theorem]].  The '''Riemannian Penrose inequality''' is an important special case.  Specifically, if (''M'',&amp;nbsp;''g'') is an [[asymptotically flat]] Riemannian [[3-manifold]] with nonnegative [[scalar curvature]] and [[ADM mass]] ''m'', and ''A'' is the area of the outermost [[minimal surface]] (possibly with multiple [[Connected component (topology)|connected components]]), then the Riemannian Penrose inequality asserts

: &lt;math&gt;m \geq \sqrt{\frac{A}{16\pi}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is purely a geometrical fact, and it corresponds to the case of a complete three-dimensional, [[space-like]], [[totally geodesic]] [[submanifold]]
of a (3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional spacetime.  Such a submanifold is often called a time-symmetric initial data set for a spacetime.  The condition of (''M'',&amp;nbsp;''g'') having nonnegative scalar curvature is equivalent to the spacetime obeying the [[dominant energy condition]].

This inequality was first proved by [[Gerhard Huisken]] and [[Tom Ilmanen]] in 1997 in the case where ''A'' is the area of the largest component of the outermost minimal surface.  Their proof relied on the machinery of weakly defined [[inverse mean curvature flow]], which they developed.  In 1999, [[Hubert Bray]] gave the first complete proof of the above inequality using a conformal [[geometric flow|flow]] of metrics.  Both of the papers were published in 2001.

== Physical motivation ==
The original physical argument that led Penrose to conjecture such an inequality invoked the [[Hawking area theorem]] and the [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]].

== Case of equality ==
Both the Bray and Huisken–Ilmanen proofs of the Riemannian Penrose inequality state that under the hypotheses, if

: &lt;math&gt;m = \sqrt{\frac{A}{16\pi}},&lt;/math&gt;
then the manifold in question is isometric to a slice of the [[Schwarzschild spacetime]] outside of the outermost minimal surface.

== Penrose conjecture ==
More generally, Penrose conjectured that an inequality as above should hold for spacelike submanifolds of spacetimes that are not necessarily time-symmetric. In this case, nonnegative scalar curvature is replaced with the [[dominant energy condition]], and one possibility is to replace the minimal surface condition  with an [[apparent horizon]] condition. Proving such an inequality remains an open problem in general relativity, called the '''Penrose conjecture.'''

== In Popular Culture ==
*In episode 6 of season 8 of the television sitcom ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', Dr. Sheldon Cooper claims to be in the process of solving the Penrose Conjecture while at the same time composing his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29971">In [[mathematics]], the '''Schoenflies problem''' or '''Schoenflies theorem''',  of [[geometric topology]] is a sharpening of the [[Jordan curve theorem]] by [[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies|Arthur Schoenflies]]. For [[Camille Jordan|Jordan]] curves in the plane it is often referred to as the '''Jordan–Schoenflies theorem.'''

==Original formulation==
The original formulation of the Schoenflies problem states that not only does every [[simple closed curve]] in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] separate the plane into two regions, one (the "inside") [[bounded set|bounded]] and the other (the "outside") unbounded; but also that these two regions are [[homeomorphic]] to the inside and outside of a standard [[circle]] in the plane.

An alternative statement is that if &lt;math&gt;C \subset \mathbb R^2&lt;/math&gt; is a simple closed curve, then there is a homeomorphism &lt;math&gt;f : \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^2&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(C)&lt;/math&gt; is the unit [[circle]] in the plane. Elementary proofs can be found in {{harvtxt|Newman|1939}}, {{harvtxt|Cairns|1951}}, {{harvtxt|Moise|1977}} and {{harvtxt|Thomassen|1992}}. The result can first be proved for polygons when the homeomorphism can be taken to be piecewise linear and the identity map off some compact set; the case of a continuous curve is then deduced by approximating by polygons. The theorem is also an immediate consequence of [[Carathéodory's theorem (conformal mapping)|Carathéodory's extension theorem]] for [[Riemann mapping theorem|conformal mappings]], as discussed in {{harvtxt|Pommerenke|1992|page=25}}.

If the curve is smooth then the homeomorphism can be chosen to be a [[diffeomorphism]]. Proofs in this case rely on techniques from [[differential topology]]. Although direct proofs are possible (starting for example from the polygonal case), existence of the diffeomorphism can also be deduced by using the smooth [[Riemann mapping theorem]] for the interior and exterior of the curve in combination with the [[Alexander trick]] for diffeomorphisms of the circle and a result on smooth [[Homotopy#Isotopy|isotopy]] from differential topology.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Hirsch|1994}}
*{{harvnb|Shastri|2011}}
*{{harvnb|Napier|Ramachandran|2011}}
*{{harvnb|Taylor|2011}}
*{{harvnb|Kerzman|1977}}
*{{harvnb|Bell|Krantz|1987}}
*{{harvnb|Bell|1992}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a theorem is valid only in two dimensions. In three dimensions there are [[counterexample]]s such as [[Alexander's horned sphere]]. Although they separate space into two regions, those regions are so twisted and knotted that they are not homeomorphic to the inside and outside of a normal sphere.

==Proofs of the Jordan–Schoenflies theorem==
For smooth or polygonal curves, the [[Jordan curve theorem]] can be proved in a straightforward way. Indeed the curve has a [[tubular neighbourhood]], defined in the smooth case by the field of unit normal vectors to the curve or in the polygonal case by points at a distance of less than ε from the curve.
In a neighbourhood of a differentiable point on the curve, there is a coordinate change in which the curve becomes the diameter of an open disk. Taking a point not on the curve, a straight line aimed at the curve starting at the point will eventually meet the tubular neighborhood; the path can be continued next to the curve until it meets the disk. It will meet it on one side or the other. This proves that the complement of the curve has at most two connected components. On the other hand using the [[Cauchy integral formula]] for the [[winding number]], it can be seen that the winding number is constant on connected components of the complement of the curve, is zero near infinity and increases by 1 when crossing the curve. Hence the curve has exactly two components, its interior and the unbounded component. The same argument works for a piecewise differentiable Jordan curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katok|Climenhaga|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polygonal curve===
Given a simple closed polygonal curve in the plane, the '''piecewise linear Jordan–Schoenflies theorem''' states that there is a piecewise linear homeomorphism of the plane, with compact support, carrying the polygon onto a triangle and taking the interior and exterior of one onto the interior and exterior of the other.&lt;ref&gt;See: 
*{{harvnb|Moise|1977}}
*{{harvnb|Bing|1983}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior of the polygon can be triangulated by small triangles, so that the edges of the polygon form edges of some of the small triangles. Piecewise linear homeomorphisms can be made up from special homeomorphisms obtained by removing a diamond from the plane and taking a piecewise affine map, fixing the edges of the diamond, but moving one diagonal into a V shape. Compositions of homeomorphisms of this kind give rise to piecewise linear homeomorphisms of compact support; they fix the outside of a polygon and act in an affine way on a triangulation of the interior. A simple inductive argument shows that it is always possible to remove a ''free'' triangle—one for which the intersection with the boundary is a connected set made up of one or two edges—leaving a simple closed Jordan polygon. The special homeomorphisms described above or their inverses provide piecewise linear homeomorphisms which carry the interior of the larger polygon onto the polygon with the free triangle removed. Iterating this process it follows that there is a piecewise linear homeomorphism of compact support carrying the original polygon onto a triangle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moise|1977|pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the homormorphism is obtained by composing finite many homeomorphisms of the plane of compact support, it follows that the piecewise linear homeomorphism in the statement of the piecewise linear Jordan-Schoenflies theorem has compact support.

As a corollary, it follows that any homeomorphism between simple closed polygonal curves extends to a homeomorphism between their interiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bing|1983|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For each polygon there is a homeomorphism of a given triangle onto the closure of their interior. The three homeomorphisms yield a single homeomorphism of the boundary of the triangle. By the [[Alexander trick]] this homeomorphism can be extended to a homeomorphism of closure of interior of the triangle. Reversing this process this homeomorphism yields a homeomorphism between the closures of the interiors of the polygonal curves.

===Continuous curve===
The Jordan-Schoenflies theorem for continuous curves can be proved using [[Carathéodory's theorem (conformal mapping)|Carathéodory's theorem]] on [[conformal mapping]]. It states that the [[Riemann mapping theorem|Riemann mapping]] between the interior of a simple Jordan curve and the open unit disk extends continuously to a homeomorphism between their closures, mapping the Jordan curve homeomorphically onto the unit circle.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Carathéodory|1913}}
*{{harvnb|Goluzin|1969|page=44}}
*{{harvnb|Pommerenke|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prove the theorem, Carathéodory's theorem can be applied to the two regions on the [[Riemann sphere]] defined by the Jordan curve. This will result in homeomorphisms between their closures and the closed disks |''z''| ≤ 1 and |''z''| ≥ 1. The homeomorphisms from the Jordan curve to
the circle will differ by a homeomorphism of the circle which can be extended to the unit disk (or its complement) by the [[Alexander trick]]. Composition with this homeomorphism will yield a pair of homeomorphisms which match on the Jordan curve and therefore define a homeomorphism of the Riemann sphere carrying the Jordan curve onto the unit circle.

The continuous case can also be deduced from the polygonal case by approximating the continuous curve by a polygon.&lt;ref&gt;See: 
*{{harvnb|Moise|1977}}
*{{harvnb|Bing|1983}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Jordan curve theorem is first deduced by this method. The Jordan curve is given by a continuous function on the unit circle. It and the inverse function from its image back to the unit circle are [[uniformly continuous]]. So dividing the circle up into small enough intervals, there are points on the curve such that the line segments joining adjacent points lie close to the curve, say by ε. Together these line segments form a polygonal curve. If it has self-intersections, these must also create polygonal loops. Erasing these loops, results in a polygonal curve without self-intersections which still lies close to the curve; some its vertices might not lie on the curve, but they all lie within a neighbourhood of the curve. The polygonal curve divides the plane into two regions, one bounded region ''U'' and one unbounded region ''V''. Both ''U'' and ''V'' ∪ ∞ are continuous images of the closed unit disk. Since the original curve is contained within a small neighbourhood of the polygonal curve, the union of the images of slightly smaller concentric open disks entirely misses the original curve only excludes a small neighbourhood of it. One is a bounded open set consisting of points around which the curve has [[winding number]] one; the other is an unbounded open set consisting of points of winding number zero. Repeating for a sequence of values of ε tending to 0, leads to a union of open path-connected bounded sets of points of winding number one and a union of open path-connected unbounded sets of winding number zero. By construction these two disjoint open path-connected sets fill out the complement of the curve in the plane.&lt;ref&gt;See:

[[File:Radford-stretcher-bond.jpeg|thumb|A standard brickwork tiling of the plane]]
Given the Jordan curve theorem, the Jordan-Schoenflies theorem can be proved as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bing|pages=29–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The first step is to show that a dense set of points on the curve are '''accessible''' from the inside of the curve, i.e. they are at the end of a line segment lying entirely in the interior of the curve. In fact, a given point on the curve is arbitrarily close to some point in the interior and there is a smallest closed disk about that point which intersects the curve only on its boundary; those boundary points are close to the original point on the curve and by construction are accessible.
*The second step is to prove that given finitely many accessible points ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; on the curve connected to line segments ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in its interior, there are  disjoint polygonal curves in the interior with vertices on each of the line segments such that their distance to the original curve is arbitrarily small. This requires [[tessellation]]s of the plane by uniformly small tiles such that if two tiles meet they have they have a side or a segment of a side in common: examples are the standard [[hexagonal tessellation]]; or the standard [[brickwork]] tiling by rectangles or squares with common or stretch bonds. It suffices to construct a polygonal path so that its distance to the Jordan curve is arbitrarily small. Orient the tessellation such no side of a tiles is parallel to any ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The size of the tiles can be taken arbitrarily small. Take the union of all the closed tiles containing at least one point of the Jordan curve. Its boundary is made up of disjoint polygonal curves. If the size of the tiles is sufficiently small, the endpoints ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; will lie in the interior of exactly one of the polygonal boundary curves. Its distance to the Jordan curve is less than twice the diameter of the tiles, so is arbitrarily small.
*The third step is to prove that any homeomorphism ''f'' between the curve and a given triangle can be extended to a homeomorphism between the closures of their interiors. In fact take a sequence ε&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ε&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ε&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... decreasing to zero. Choose finitely many points ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; on the Jordan curve Γ with successive points less than ε&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; apart. Make the construction of the second step with tiles of diameter less than ε&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and take ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to be the points on the polygonal curve Γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; intersecting ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Take the points ''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) on the triangle. Fix an origin in the triangle Δ and scale the triangle to get a smaller one Δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at a distance less than ε&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; from the original triangle. Let ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the points at the intersection of the radius through ''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) and the smaller triangle. There is a piecewise linear homeomorphism ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of the polygonal curve onto the smaller triangle carrying ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. By the Jordan-Schoenflies theorem it extends to a homeomorphism ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; between the closure of their interiors. Now carry out the same process for ε&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a new set of points on the Jordan curve. This will produce a second polygonal path Γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; between Γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Γ. There is likewise a second triangle Δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; between  Δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Δ. The line segments for the accessible points on Γ divide the polygonal region between Γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; into a union of polygonal regions; similarly for radii for the corresponding points on Δ divides the region between Δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and  Δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; into a union of polygonal regions. The homeomorphism ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be extended to homeomorphisms between the different polygons, agreeing on common edges (closed intervals on line segments or radii). By the polygonal Jordan-Schoenflies theorem, each of these homeomorphisms extends to the interior of the polygon. Together they yield a homeomorphism ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the closure of the interior of Γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto the closure of the interior of Δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extends ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Continuing in this way produces polygonal curves Γ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and triangles Δ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with a homomeomorphism ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; between the closures of their interiors; ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; extends ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' – 1&lt;/sub&gt;. The regions inside the  Γ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; increase to the region inside Γ; and the triangles Δ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; increase to Δ. The homeomorphisms ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; patch together to give a homeomorphism ''F'' from the interior of Γ onto the interior of Δ. By construction it has limit ''f'' on the boundary curves Γ and Δ. Hence ''F'' is the required homeomorphism.
*The fourth step is to prove that any homeomorphism between Jordan curves can be extended to a homeomorphism between the closures of their interiors. By the result of the third step, it is sufficient to show that any homeomorphism of the boundary of a triangle extends to a homeomorphism of the closure of its interior. This is a consequence of the Alexander trick. (Note that the Alexander trick also establishes a homeomorphism between the solid triangle and the closed disk: the homeomorphism is just the natural radial extension of the projection of the triangle onto its circumcircle with respect to its circumcentre.)
*The final step is to prove that given two Jordan curves there is a homeomorphism of the plane of compact support carrying one curve onto the other. In fact each Jordan curve lies inside the same large circle and in the interior of each large circle there are radii joining two diagonally opposite poinrs to the curve. Each configuration divide the plane into the exterior of the large circle, the interior of the Jordan curve and the region between the two into two bounded regions bounded by Jordan curves (formed of two radii, a semicircle, and one of the halves of the Jordan curve). Take the identity homeomorphism of the large circle; piecewise linear homeomorphisms between the two pairs of radii; and a homeomorphism between the two pairs of halves of the Jordan curves given by a linear reparametrization. The 4 homeomorphisms patch together on the boundary arcs to yield a homeomorphism of the plane given by the identity off the large circleand carrying one Jordan curve onto the other.

===Smooth curve===
Proofs in the smooth case depend on finding a diffeomorphism between the interior/exterior of the curve and the closed unit disk (or its complement in the extended plane). This can be solved for example by using the smooth [[Riemann mapping theorem]], for which a number of direct methods are available, for example through the [[Dirichlet problem]] on the curve or [[Bergman kernel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Napier|Ramachandran|2011}}
*{{harvnb|Taylor|2011}}
*{{harvnb|Kerzman|1977}}
*{{harvnb|Bell|Krantz|1987}}
*{{harvnb|Bell|1992}}
&lt;/ref&gt; (Such diffeomorphisms will be holomorphic on the interior and exterior of the curve; more general diffeomorphisms can be constructed more easily using vector fields and flows.) Regarding the smooth curve as lying inside the extended plane or 2-sphere, these analytic methods produce smooth maps up to the boundary between the closure of the interior/exterior of the smooth curve and those of the unit circle. The two identifications of the smooth curve and the unit circle will 
differ by a diffeomorphism of the unit circle. On the other hand a diffeomorphism {{math|''f''}} of the unit circle can be extended to a diffeomorphism {{math|''F''}} of the unit disk by the [[Alexander trick|Alexander extension]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{F(r e^{i\theta})= r \exp [i\psi(r)g(\theta) + i(1-\psi(r))\theta],}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|ψ}} is a smooth function with values in [0,1], equal to 0 near 0 and 1 near 1, and {{math|1=''f''(''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''θ&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ig''(θ)&lt;/sup&gt;}}, with {{math|1=''g''(θ + 2π) = ''g''(θ) + 2π}}. Composing one of the diffeomorphisms with the Alexander extension allows the two diffeomorphisms to be patched together to give a homeomorphism of the 2-sphere which restricts to a diffeomorphism on the closed unit disk and the closures of its complement which it carries onto the interior and exterior of the original smooth curve. By the ''isotopy theorem'' in differential topology,&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Hirsch|1994|page=182}}, Theorem 1.9
*{{harvnb|Shastri|2011|page=173}}, Theorem 6.4.3&lt;/ref&gt; the homeomorphism can be adjusted to a diffeomorphism on the whole 2-sphere without changing it on the unit circle. This diffeomorphism then provides the smooth solution to the Schoenflies problem.

The Jordan-Schoenflies theorem can be deduced using [[differential topology]]. In fact it is an immediate consequence of the classification up to diffeomorphism of smooth oriented 2-manifolds with boundary, as described in {{harvtxt|Hirsch|1994}}. Indeed the smooth curve divides the 2-sphere into two parts. By the classification each is diffeomorphic to the unit disk and—taking into account the isotopy theorem—they are glued together by a diffeomorphism of the boundary. By the Alexander trick, such a diffeomorphism extends to the disk itself. Thus there is a diffeomorphism of the 2-sphere carrying the smooth curve onto the unit circle.

On the other hand the diffeomorphism can also be constructed directly using the Jordan-Schoenflies theorem for polygons and elementary methods from differential topology, namely flows defined by vector fields.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Smale|1961}}
*{{harvnb|Milnor|1965}}
*{{harvnb|Hirsch|1994}}
*{{harvnb|Shastri|2011}}
*{{harvnb|Matsumoto|2002}}
*{{harvnb|Nicolaescu|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Jordan curve is smooth (parametrized by arc length) the unit normal vectors give a non-vanishing vector field ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in a [[tubular neighbourhood]] ''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of the curve. Take a polygonal curve in the interior of the curve close to the boundary and transverse to the curve (at the vertices the vector field should be strictly within the angle formed by the edges). By the piecewise linear Jordan–Schoenflies theorem, there is a piecewise linear homeomorphism, affine on an appropriate triangulation of the interior of the polygon, taking the polygon onto a triangle. Take an interior point ''P'' in one of the small triangles of the triangulation. It corresponds to a point ''Q'' in the image triangle. There is a radial vector field on the image triangle, formed of straight lines pointing towards ''Q''. This gives a series of lines in the small triangles making up the polygon. Each defines a vector field ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; on a neighbourhood ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of the closure of the triangle. Each vector field is transverse to the sides, provided that ''Q'' is chosen in "general position" so that it is not collinear with any of the finitely many edges in the triangulation. Translating if necessary, it can be assumed that ''P'' and ''Q'' are at the origin 0. On the triangle containing ''P'' the vector field can be taken to be the standard radial vector field. Similarly the same procedure can be applied to the outside of the smooth curve, after applying Möbius transformation to map it into the finite part of the plane and ∞ to 0. In this case the neighbourhoods ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of the triangles have negative indices. Take the vector fields ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with a negative sign, pointing away from the point at infinity. Together ''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s with ''i'' ≠ 0 form an open cover of the 2-sphere. Take a smooth [[partition of unity]] ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; subordinate to the cover ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and set

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{X=\sum \psi_i\cdot X_i.}&lt;/math&gt;

''X'' is a smooth vector field on the two sphere vanishing only at 0 and ∞.  It has index 1 at 0 and -1 at ∞. Near 0 the vector field equals the radial vector field pointing towards 0.  If α&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the smooth flow defined by ''X'', the point 0 is an [[attractor|attracting point]] and ∞ a repelling point. As ''t'' tends to +∞, the flow send points to 0; while as ''t'' tends to –∞ points are sent to ∞.  Replacing ''X'' by ''f''⋅''X'' with ''f'' a smooth positive function, changes the parametrization of the [[integral curve]]s of ''X'', but not the integral curves themselves. For an appropriate choice of ''f'' equal to 1 outside a small annulus near 0, the integral curves starting at points of the smooth curve will all reach smaller circle bounding the annulus at the same time ''s''. The diffeomorphism α&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; therefore carries the smooth curve onto this small circle. A scaling transformation, fixing 0 and ∞, then carries the small circle onto the unit circle. Composing these diffeomorphisms gives a diffeomorphism carrying the smooth curve onto the unit circle.

==Generalizations==
There does exist a higher-dimensional generalization due to {{harvs|txt|last=Brown|first=Morton|authorlink=Morton Brown|year=1960}} and independently {{harvs|txt|last=Mazur|first=Barry|authorlink=Barry Mazur|year=1959}} with {{harvtxt|Morse|1960}}, which is also called the generalized '''Schoenflies theorem'''.  It states that, if an (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional [[sphere]] ''S'' is embedded into the ''n''-dimensional sphere ''S&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' in a [[locally flat]] way (that is, the embedding extends to that of a thickened sphere), then the pair (''S&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'',&amp;nbsp;''S'') is homeomorphic to the pair (''S&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;), where ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the equator of the ''n''-sphere.  Brown and Mazur received the [[Veblen Prize]] for their contributions.

The Schoenflies problem can be posed in categories other than the topologically locally flat category, i.e. does a smoothly (piecewise-linearly) embedded (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-sphere in the ''n''-sphere bound a smooth (piecewise-linear) ''n''-ball?  For ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, the problem is still open for both categories. See [[Mazur manifold]]. For ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;5 the question has an affirmative answer, and follows from the [[h-cobordism]] theorem.

In [[mathematics]], applying the '''Schwarz reflection principle''' is a way to extend the domain of definition of an [[analytic function]] of a [[complex variable]], ''F'', which is defined on the [[upper half-plane]] and has well-defined and [[real number]] boundary values on the [[real axis]]. In that case, the putative extension of ''F'' to the rest of the [[complex plane]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{F(\bar{z})}&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;F(\bar{z})=\overline{F(z)}.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, we make the definition that agrees along the real axis.

The result proved by [[Hermann Schwarz]] is as follows. Suppose that ''F'' is a [[continuous function]] on the closed upper half plane &lt;math&gt;\left\{ z \in \mathbb{C}\ |\ \mathrm{Im}(z) \geq 0 \right\} &lt;/math&gt;, [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] on the upper half plane &lt;math&gt;\left\{ F(z) \in \mathbb{C}\ |\ \mathrm{Im}(z) &gt; 0 \right\} &lt;/math&gt;, which takes real values on the real axis. Then the extension formula given above is an [[analytic continuation]] to the whole complex plane.

In practice it would be better to have a theorem that allows ''F'' certain singularities, for example ''F'' a [[meromorphic function]]. To understand such extensions, one needs a proof method that can be weakened. In fact [[Morera's theorem]] is well adapted to proving such statements. [[Contour integral]]s involving the extension of ''F'' clearly split into two, using part of the real axis. So, given that the principle is rather easy to prove in the special case from Morera's theorem, understanding the proof is enough to generate other results.

The principle also adapts to apply to [[harmonic function]]s.

In [[mathematical logic]] and [[philosophy]], '''Skolem's paradox''' is a seeming contradiction that arises from the downward [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]]. [[Thoralf Skolem]] (1922) was the first to discuss the seemingly contradictory aspects of the theorem, and to discover the relativity of set-theoretic notions now known as non-[[absoluteness (mathematical logic)|absoluteness]]. Although it is not an actual [[antinomy]] like [[Russell's paradox]], the result is typically called a [[paradox]], and was described as a "paradoxical state of affairs" by Skolem (1922: p.&amp;nbsp;295).   

Skolem's paradox is that every [[countable set|countable]] [[axiomatisation]] of [[set theory]] in [[first-order logic]], if it is [[consistent]], has a [[structure (mathematical logic)|model]] that is countable. This appears contradictory because it is possible to prove, from those same axioms, a sentence that intuitively says (or that precisely says in the standard model of the theory) that there exist sets that are not countable. Thus the seeming contradiction is that a model that is itself countable, and which therefore contains only countable sets, [[Satisfiability|satisfies]] the first order sentence that intuitively states "there are uncountable sets".  

A mathematical explanation of the paradox, showing that it is not a contradiction in mathematics, was given by Skolem (1922). Skolem's work was harshly received by [[Ernst Zermelo]], who argued against the limitations of first-order logic, but the result quickly came to be accepted by the mathematical community. 

The philosophical implications of Skolem's paradox have received much study. One line of inquiry questions whether it is accurate to claim that any first-order sentence actually states "there are uncountable sets". This line of thought can be extended to question whether any set is uncountable in an absolute sense. More recently, the paper "Models and Reality" by [[Hilary Putnam]], and responses to it, led to renewed interest in the philosophical aspects of Skolem's result.

== Background ==

One of the earliest results in [[set theory]], published by [[Georg Cantor]] in 1874, was the existence of [[uncountable]] sets, such as the [[powerset]] of the [[natural numbers]], the set of [[real numbers]], and the [[Cantor set]]. An infinite set ''X'' is countable if there is a function that gives a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between ''X'' and the natural numbers, and is uncountable if there is no such correspondence function. When Zermelo proposed his axioms for set theory in 1908, he proved [[Cantor's theorem]] from them to demonstrate their strength. 

Löwenheim (1915) and Skolem (1920, 1923) proved the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]]. The downward form of this theorem shows that if a [[countable set|countable]] [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[axiomatisation]] is satisfied by any infinite [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]], then the same axioms are satisfied by some countable structure.   In particular, this implies that if the first order versions of Zermelo's axioms of set theory are satisfiable, they are satisfiable in some countable model. The same is true of any consistent first order axiomatisation of set theory.

==The paradoxical result and its mathematical implications==

Skolem (1922) pointed out the seeming contradiction between the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem on the one hand, which implies that there is a countable model of Zermelo's axioms, and Cantor's theorem on the other hand, which states that uncountable sets exist, and which is provable from Zermelo's axioms. "So far as I know," Skolem writes, "no one has called attention to this peculiar and apparently paradoxical state of affairs. By virtue of the axioms we can prove the existence of higher cardinalities... How can it be, then, that the entire domain ''B'' [a countable model of Zermelo's axioms] can already be enumerated by means of the finite positive integers?" (Skolem 1922, p.&amp;nbsp;295, translation by Bauer-Mengelberg) 

More specifically, let ''B'' be a countable model of Zermelo's axioms. Then there is some set ''u'' in ''B'' such that ''B'' satisfies the first-order formula saying that ''u'' is uncountable. For example, ''u'' could be taken as the set of real numbers in ''B''. Now, because ''B'' is countable, there are only countably many elements ''c'' such that ''c'' &amp;isin; ''u'' according to ''B'', because there are only countably many elements ''c'' in ''B'' to begin with. Thus it appears that ''u'' should be countable. This is Skolem's paradox. 

Skolem went on to explain why there was no contradiction. In the context of a specific model of set theory, the term "set" does not refer to an arbitrary set, but only to a set that is actually included in the model. The definition of countability requires that a certain one-to-one correspondence, which is itself a set, must exist. Thus it is possible to recognise that a particular set ''u'' is countable, but not countable in a particular model of set theory, because there is no set in the model that gives a one-to-one correspondence between ''u'' and the natural numbers in that model. 

From an interpretation of the model into our conventional notions of these sets, this means that although ''u'' maps to an uncountable set, there are many elements in our intuitive notion of ''u'' that don't have a corresponding element in the model. The model, however, is consistent, because the absence of these elements cannot be observed through first-order logic. With ''u'' as the reals, these missing elements would correspond to [[definable real number|undefinable numbers]]. 

Skolem used the term "relative" to describe this state of affairs, where the same set is included in two models of set theory, is countable in one model, and is not countable in the other model. He described this as the "most important" result in his paper. Contemporary set theorists describe concepts that do not depend on the choice of a [[transitive model]] as [[absoluteness (mathematical logic)|absolute]]. From their point of view, Skolem's paradox simply shows that countability is not an absolute property in first order logic. (Kunen 1980 p.&amp;nbsp;141; Enderton 2001 p.&amp;nbsp;152; Burgess 1977 p.&amp;nbsp;406).

Skolem described his work as a critique of (first-order) set theory, intended to illustrate its weakness as a foundational system:
:"I believed that it was so clear that axiomatisation in terms of sets was not a satisfactory ultimate foundation of mathematics that mathematicians would, for the most part, not be very much concerned with it. But in recent times I have seen to my surprise that so many mathematicians think that these axioms of set theory provide the ideal foundation for mathematics; therefore it seemed to me that the time had come for a critique." (Ebbinghaus and van Dalen, 2000, p. 147)

== Reception by the mathematical community ==

A central goal of early research into set theory was to find a first-order axiomatisation for set theory which was [[Morley's categoricity theorem|categorical]], meaning that the axioms would have exactly one model, consisting of all sets. Skolem's result showed this is not possible, creating doubts about the use of set theory as a foundation of mathematics. It took some time for the theory of first-order logic to be developed enough for mathematicians to understand the cause of Skolem's result; no resolution of the paradox was widely accepted during the 1920s. Fraenkel (1928) still described the result as an antinomy:
:"Neither have the books yet been closed on the antinomy, nor has agreement on its significance and possible solution yet been reached." (van Dalen and Ebbinghaus, 2000, p. 147).

In 1925, [[von Neumann]] presented a novel axiomatisation of set theory, which developed into [[NBG set theory]]. Very much aware of Skolem's 1922 paper, von Neumann investigated countable models of his axioms in detail. In his concluding remarks, Von Neumann comments that there is no categorical axiomatisation of set theory, or any other theory with an infinite model. Speaking of the impact of Skolem's paradox, he wrote,
:"At present we can do no more than note that we have one more reason here to entertain reservations about set theory and that for the time being no way of rehabilitating this theory is known."(Ebbinghaus and van Dalen, 2000, p. 148)

Zermelo at first considered the Skolem paradox a hoax (van Dalen and Ebbinghaus, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;148 ff.), and spoke against it starting in 1929. Skolem's result applies only to what is now called [[first-order logic]], but Zermelo argued against the [[finitism|finitary]] [[metamathematics]] that underlie first-order logic (Kanamori 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;519 ff.). Zermelo argued that his axioms should instead be studied in [[second-order logic]], a setting in which Skolem's result does not apply. Zermelo published a second-order axiomatisation in 1930 and proved several categoricity results in that context. Zermelo's further work on the foundations of set theory after Skolem's paper led to his discovery of the [[cumulative hierarchy]] and formalisation of [[infinitary logic]] (van Dalen and Ebbinghaus, 2000, note 11). 

Fraenkel ''et al.'' (1973, pp.&amp;nbsp;303&amp;ndash;304) explain why Skolem's result was so surprising to set theorists in the 1920s. [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] and the [[compactness theorem]] were not proved until 1929. These theorems illuminated the way that first-order logic behaves and established its finitary nature, although Gödel's original proof of the completeness theorem was complicated. [[Leon Henkin]]'s alternative proof of the completeness theorem, which is now a standard technique for constructing countable models of a consistent first-order theory, was not presented until 1947. Thus, in 1922, the particular properties of first-order logic that permit Skolem's paradox to go through were not yet understood. It is now known that Skolem's paradox is unique to first-order logic; if set theory is studied using [[higher-order logic]] with full semantics then it does not have any countable models, due to the semantics being used.

== Current mathematical opinion ==

Current mathematical logicians do not view Skolem's paradox as any sort of fatal flaw in set theory.  [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] (1967, p.&amp;nbsp;324) describes the result as "not a paradox in the sense of outright contradiction, but rather a kind of anomaly". After surveying Skolem's argument that the result is not contradictory, Kleene concludes  "there is no absolute notion of countability."  Hunter (1971, p.&amp;nbsp;208) describes the contradiction as "hardly even a paradox".   Fraenkel ''et al.'' (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;304) explain that contemporary mathematicians are no more bothered by the lack of categoricity of first-order theories than they are bothered by the conclusion of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] that no consistent, effective, and sufficiently strong set of
first-order axioms is complete. 

Countable models of ZF have become common tools in the study of set theory. [[Forcing (set theory)|Forcing]], for example, is often explained in terms of countable models. The fact that these countable models of ZF still satisfy the theorem that there are uncountable sets is not considered a pathology; van Heijenoort (1967) describes it as "a novel and unexpected feature of formal systems." (van Heijenoort 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;290) 

Although most mathematicians no longer consider Skolem's result paradoxical, the result is often discussed by philosophers, who may not be satisfied with a merely mathematical resolution of the paradox.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10520">In the branch of [[mathematics]] known as [[topology]], the '''specialization''' (or '''canonical''') '''preorder''' is a natural [[preorder]] on the set of the points of a [[topological space]]. For most spaces that are considered in practice, namely for all those that satisfy the [[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[separation axiom]], this preorder is even a [[partial order]] (called the '''specialization order'''). On the other hand, for [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; spaces]] the order becomes trivial and is of little interest.

The specialization order is often considered in applications in [[computer science]], where T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; spaces occur in [[denotational semantics]]. The specialization order is also important for identifying suitable topologies on partially ordered sets, as is done in [[order theory]].

== Definition and motivation ==

Consider any topological space ''X''. The '''specialization preorder''' ≤ on ''X'' relates two points of ''X'' when one lies in the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of the other. However, various authors disagree on which 'direction' the order should go. What is agreed{{Citation needed|reason=This seems counter-intuitive, looks like specialization and generization could be mixed up. Consider the topology on the set of words in a finite alphabet where basic open sets are sets of words with given prefixes (each word defines the basic open set consisting of all the words that have this word as a prefix).|date=June 2017}} is that if

:''x'' is contained in cl{''y''},

(where cl{''y''} denotes the closure of the [[singleton set]] {''y''}, i.e. the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of all [[closed set]]s containing  {''y''}), we say that ''x'' is a '''specialization''' of ''y'' and that ''y'' is a '''generization''' of ''x''; this is commonly written using a wavy arrow (such as the one given by the command ''\leadsto'' in the ''amssymb'' LaTeX package) leading from ''y'' to ''x''.

Unfortunately, the property "''x'' is a specialization of ''y''" is alternatively written as "''x'' ≤ ''y''" and as "''y'' ≤ ''x''" by various authors (see, respectively, &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Hartshorne | first = Robin | year = 1977 | title = Algebraic geometry | publisher = Springer-Verlag | publication-place = New York-Heidelberg | page = | url = https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-1-4757-3849-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hochster |first=M. |year=1969 |title=Prime ideal structure in commutative rings |publisher=Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. |publication-place= |volume=142 |pages=43–60 |url=https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1969-142-00/S0002-9947-1969-0251026-X/S0002-9947-1969-0251026-X.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Both definitions have intuitive justifications: in the case of the former, we have

:''x'' ≤ ''y'' [[if and only if]] cl{''x''} ⊆ cl{''y''}.

However in the case where our space ''X'' is the [[prime spectrum]] ''Spec R'' of a commutative ring ''R'' (which is the motivational situation in applications related to [[algebraic geometry]]), then under our second definition of the order, we have

:''y'' ≤ ''x'' if and only if ''y'' ⊆ ''x'' as prime ideals of the ring ''R''.

For the sake of consistency, for the remainder of this article we will take the first definition, that "''x'' is a specialization of ''y''" be written as ''x'' ≤ ''y''. We then see,

:''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if ''x'' is contained in all [[closed set]]s that contain ''y''.
:''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if ''y'' is contained in all [[open set]]s that contain ''x''.

These restatements help to explain why one speaks of a "specialization": ''y'' is more general than ''x'', since it is contained in more open sets. This is particularly intuitive if one views closed sets as properties that a point ''x'' may or may not have. The more closed sets contain a point, the more properties the point has, and the more special it is. The usage is [[consistent]] with the classical logical notions of [[genus]] and [[species]]; and also with the traditional use of [[generic point]]s in [[algebraic geometry]], in which closed points are the most specific, while a generic point of a space is one contained in every nonempty open subset. Specialization as an idea is applied also in [[valuation theory]].

The intuition of upper elements being more specific is typically found in [[domain theory]], a branch of order theory that has ample applications in computer science.

== Upper and lower sets ==

Let ''X'' be a topological space and let ≤ be the specialization preorder on ''X''. Every [[open set]] is an [[upper set]] with respect to ≤ and every [[closed set]] is a [[lower set]]. The converses are not generally true. In fact, a topological space is an [[Alexandrov-discrete space]] if and only if every upper set is also open (or equivalently every lower set is also closed).

Let ''A'' be a subset of ''X''. The smallest upper set containing ''A'' is denoted ↑''A''
and the smallest lower set containing ''A'' is denoted ↓''A''. In case ''A'' = {''x''} is a singleton one uses the notation ↑''x'' and ↓''x''. For ''x'' ∈ ''X'' one has:

*↑''x'' = {''y'' ∈ ''X'' : ''x'' ≤ ''y''} = ∩{open sets containing ''x''}.
*↓''x'' = {''y'' ∈ ''X'' : ''y'' ≤ ''x''} = ∩{closed sets containing ''x''} = cl{''x''}.

The lower set ↓''x'' is always closed; however, the upper set ↑''x'' need not be open or closed. The closed points of a topological space ''X'' are precisely the [[minimal element]]s of ''X'' with respect to ≤.

== Examples ==

* In the [[Sierpinski space]] {0,1} with open sets {∅, {1}, {0,1}} the specialization order is the natural one (0 ≤ 0, 0 ≤ 1, and 1 ≤ 1).
* If ''p'', ''q'' are elements of Spec(''R'') (the [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] of a [[commutative ring]] ''R'') then ''p'' ≤ ''q'' if and only if ''q'' ⊆ ''p'' (as [[prime ideal]]s). Thus the closed points of Spec(''R'') are precisely the [[maximal ideal]]s.

== Important properties ==

As suggested by the name, the specialization preorder is a preorder, i.e. it is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]].

The [[equivalence relation]] determined by the specialization preorder is just that of [[Topologically indistinguishable|topological indistinguishability]]. That is, ''x'' and ''y'' are topologically indistinguishable if and only if  ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and  ''y'' ≤ ''x''. Therefore, the [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]] of ≤ is precisely the T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; separation axiom: if ''x'' and ''y'' are indistinguishable then ''x'' = ''y''. In this case it is justified to speak of the '''specialization order'''.

On the other hand, the [[symmetric relation|symmetry]] of specialization preorder is equivalent to the [[R0 space|R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] separation axiom: ''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if ''x'' and ''y'' are topologically indistinguishable. It follows that if the underlying topology is T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then the specialization order is discrete, i.e. one has ''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if ''x'' = ''y''. Hence, the specialization order is of little interest for T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; topologies, especially for all [[Hausdorff space]]s.

Any [[continuity (topology)|continuous function]] between two topological spaces is [[monotonic function|monotone]] with respect to the specialization preorders of these spaces. The converse, however, is not true in general. In the language of [[category theory]], we then have a [[functor]] from the [[category of topological spaces]] to the [[category of preordered sets]] which assigns a topological space its specialization preorder. This functor has a [[left adjoint]] which places the [[Alexandrov topology]] on a preordered set.

There are spaces that are more specific than T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; spaces for which this order is interesting: the [[sober space]]s. Their relationship to the specialization order is more subtle:

For any sober space ''X'' with specialization order ≤, we have
* (''X'', ≤) is a [[directed complete partial order]], i.e. every [[directed set|directed subset]] ''S'' of (''X'', ≤) has a [[supremum]] sup ''S'',
* for every directed subset ''S'' of (''X'', ≤) and every open set ''O'', if sup ''S'' is in ''O'', then ''S'' and ''O'' have [[non-empty]] [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]].

One may describe the second property by saying that open sets are ''inaccessible by directed suprema''. A topology is [[order consistent]] with respect to a certain order ≤ if it induces ≤ as its specialization order and it has the above property of inaccessibility with respect to (existing) suprema of directed sets in ≤.

== Topologies on orders ==

The specialization order yields a tool to obtain a preorder from every topology. It is natural to ask for the converse too: Is every preorder obtained as a specialization preorder of some topology?

Indeed, the answer to this question is positive and there are in general many topologies on a set ''X'' which induce a given order ≤ as their specialization order. The [[Alexandroff topology]] of the order ≤ plays a special role: it is the finest topology that induces ≤. The other extreme, the coarsest topology that induces ≤, is the [[upper topology]], the least topology within which all complements of sets {''y'' in ''X'' | ''y'' ≤ ''x''} (for some ''x'' in ''X'') are open.

There are also interesting topologies in between these two extremes. The finest sober topology that is order consistent in the above sense for a given order ≤ is the [[Scott topology]]. The upper topology however is still the coarsest sober order consistent topology. In fact, its open sets are even inaccessible by ''any'' suprema. Hence any [[sober space]] with specialization order ≤ is finer than the upper topology and coarser than the Scott topology. Yet, such a space may fail to exist, that is, there exist partial orders for which there is no sober order consistent topology. Especially, the Scott topology is not necessarily sober.

The '''St. Petersburg paradox''' or '''St. Petersburg lottery'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conceptual foundations of risk theory|author-link=Michael D. Weiss|first=Michael D.|last=Weiss|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Economic Research Service|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v33W8lKfOo0C&amp;pg=PA36|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[paradox]] related to [[probability theory|probability]] and [[decision theory]] in [[economics]]. It is based on a particular (theoretical) [[lottery]] game that leads to a [[random variable]] with infinite [[expected value]] (i.e., infinite expected payoff) but nevertheless seems to be worth only a very small amount to the participants. The St. Petersburg paradox is a situation where a naive decision criterion which takes only the expected value into account predicts a course of action that presumably no actual person would be willing to take. Several resolutions are possible.

The paradox takes its name from its resolution by [[Daniel Bernoulli]], one-time resident of the [[Saint Petersburg|eponymous Russian city]], who published his arguments in the ''Commentaries of the Imperial Academy of Science of [[Saint Petersburg]]'' {{harv|Bernoulli|1738}}. However, the problem was invented by Daniel's cousin, [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli|Nicolas Bernoulli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plous|first1=Scott|title=The psychology of decision-making|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=0070504776|chapter=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; who first stated it in a letter to [[Pierre Raymond de Montmort]] on September 9, 1713 {{harv|de Montmort|1713}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eves|first=Howard|title=An Introduction To The History of Mathematics|edition=6th|publisher=Brooks/Cole – Thomson Learning|date=1990|page=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The paradox ==
A casino offers a [[game of chance]] for a single player in which [[Coin flipping|a fair coin is tossed]] at each stage. The initial stake starts at 2 dollars and is doubled every time heads appears. The first time tails appears, the game ends and the player wins whatever is in the pot. Thus the player wins 2 dollars if tails appears on the first toss, 4 dollars if heads appears on the first toss and tails on the second, 8 dollars if heads appears on the first two tosses and tails on the third, and so on. Mathematically, the player wins 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; dollars, where ''k'' equals number of tosses (k must be a whole number and greater than zero). What would be a fair price to pay the casino for entering the game?

To answer this, one needs to consider what would be the average payout: with probability {{sfrac|1|2}}, the player wins 2 dollars; with probability {{sfrac|1|4}} the player wins 4 dollars; with probability {{sfrac|1|8}} the player wins 8 dollars, and so on. The [[expected value]] is thus

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\cdot 2+\frac{1}{4}\cdot 4 + \frac{1}{8}\cdot 8 + \frac{1}{16}\cdot 16 + \cdots \\
&amp;= 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + \cdots \\
&amp;=\infty \,. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the game can continue as long as the coin toss results in heads and in particular that the casino has unlimited resources, this sum [[unbounded|grows without bound]] and so the expected win for repeated play is an infinite amount of money. Considering nothing but the expected value of the net change in one's monetary wealth, one should therefore play the game at any price if offered the opportunity. Yet, in published descriptions of the game, many people expressed disbelief in the result. Martin Robert quotes [[Ian Hacking]] as saying "few of us would pay even $25 to enter such a game" and says most commentators would agree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Martin|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox is the discrepancy between what people seem willing to pay to enter the game and the infinite expected value.

== Solutions ==
Several approaches have been proposed for solving the paradox.

=== Expected utility theory ===
The classical resolution of the paradox involved the explicit introduction of a [[Utility|utility function]], an [[expected utility hypothesis]], and the presumption of [[Marginal utility#Diminishing marginal utility|diminishing marginal utility]] of money.

In Daniel Bernoulli's own words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The determination of the value of an item must not be based on the price, but rather on the utility it yields…. There is no doubt that a gain of one thousand [[ducat]]s is more significant to the pauper than to a rich man though both gain the same amount.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A common utility model, suggested by Bernoulli himself, is the [[logarithm|logarithmic function]] ''U''(''w'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ln(''w'') (known as [http://www.econterms.com/glossary.cgi?query=log+utility “log utility”]). It is a function of the gambler’s total wealth ''w'', and the concept of diminishing marginal utility of money is built into it. The expected utility hypothesis posits that a utility function exists the sign of whose expected net change from accepting the gamble is a good criterion for real people's behavior. For each possible event, the change in utility {{nowrap|ln(wealth after the event) − ln(wealth before the event)}} will be weighted by the probability of that event occurring. Let ''c'' be the cost charged to enter the game. The expected incremental utility of the lottery now converges to a finite value:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E(U) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{2^k}\left[\ln(w + 2^{k} - c) - \ln(w)\right] &lt; \infty \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula gives an implicit relationship between the gambler's wealth and how much he should be willing to pay to play (specifically, any ''c'' that gives a positive change in expected utility). For example, with natural log utility, a [[millionaire]] ($1,000,000) should be willing to pay up to $20.88, a person with $1,000 should pay up to $10.95, a person with $2 should borrow $1.35 and pay up to $3.35.

Before Daniel Bernoulli published, in 1728, a mathematician from [[Republic and Canton of Geneva#History|Geneva]], [[Gabriel Cramer]], had already found parts of this idea (also motivated by the St. Petersburg Paradox) in stating that
&lt;blockquote&gt;the mathematicians estimate money in proportion to its quantity, and men of good sense in proportion to the usage that they may make of it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He demonstrated in a letter to Nicolas Bernoulli&lt;ref&gt;Xavier University Computer Science. [http://cerebro.xu.edu/math/Sources/NBernoulli/correspondence_petersburg_game.pdf correspondence_petersburg_game.pdf – Nicolas Bernoulli]&lt;/ref&gt; that a square root function describing the diminishing marginal benefit of gains can resolve the problem. However, unlike Daniel Bernoulli, he did not consider the total wealth of a person, but only the gain by the lottery.

This solution by Cramer and Bernoulli, however, is not completely satisfying, since the lottery can easily be changed in a way such that the paradox reappears. To this aim, we just need to change the game so that it gives even more rapidly increasing payoffs. For any unbounded utility function, one can find a lottery that allows for a variant of the St. Petersburg paradox, as was first pointed out by Menger {{harv|Menger|1934}}.

Recently, expected utility theory has been extended to arrive at more [[Behavioral finance|behavioral decision models]]. In some of these new theories, as in [[cumulative prospect theory]], the St. Petersburg paradox again appears in certain cases, even when the utility function is concave, but not if it is bounded {{harv|Rieger|Wang|2006}}.

=== Probability weighting ===
Nicolas Bernoulli himself proposed an alternative idea for solving the paradox. He conjectured that people will neglect unlikely events {{harv|de Montmort|1713}}. Since in the St. Petersburg lottery only unlikely events yield the high prizes that lead to an infinite expected value, this could resolve the paradox. The idea of probability weighting resurfaced much later in the work on [[prospect theory]] by [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]].

[[Cumulative prospect theory]] is one popular generalization of [[expected utility theory]] that can predict many behavioral regularities {{harv|Tversky|Kahneman|1992}}. However, the overweighting of small probability events introduced in cumulative prospect theory may restore the St. Petersburg paradox. Cumulative prospect theory avoids the St. Petersburg paradox only when the power coefficient of the [[utility]] function is lower than the power coefficient of the probability weighting function {{harv|Blavatskyy|2005}}. Intuitively, the utility function must not simply be concave, but it must be concave relative to the probability weighting function to avoid the St. Petersburg paradox.
One can argue that the formulas for the prospect theory are obtained in the region of less than $400 {{harv|Tversky|Kahneman|1992}}. This is not applicable for infinitely increasing sums in the St. Petersburg paradox.

=== Rejection of mathematical expectation ===
Various authors, including [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]], have rejected maximization of expectation (even of utility) as a proper rule of conduct.&lt;!-- d'Alembert, Jean le Rond; Opuscules mathématiques (1768), vol iv,
p 284-5. --&gt;&lt;!-- Keynes, John Maynard; A Treatise on Probability (1921), Pt IV Ch XXVI §9. --&gt; Keynes, in particular, insisted that the ''relative risk''{{clarification needed|date=September 2018}} of an alternative could be sufficiently high to reject it even if its expectation were enormous.

=== Finite St. Petersburg lotteries ===
The classical St. Petersburg lottery assumes that the casino has infinite resources. This assumption is unrealistic, particularly in connection with the paradox, which involves the reactions of ordinary people to the lottery. Of course, the resources of an actual casino (or any other potential backer of the lottery) are finite. More importantly, the expected value of the lottery only [[Logarithmic growth|grows logarithmically]] with the resources of the casino. As a result, the expected value of the lottery, even when played against a casino with the largest resources realistically conceivable, is quite modest. If the total resources (or total maximum jackpot) of the casino are ''W'' dollars, then ''L'' = floor(log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''W'')) is the maximum number of times the casino can play before it no longer fully covers the next bet. The expected value ''E'' of the lottery then becomes:
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 E &amp;= \sum_{k=1}^{L} \frac{1}{2^{k}}\cdot 2^k + \sum_{k=L+1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^{k}}\cdot W\\
   &amp;= {L} ~+~ \frac{W}{2^{L}}\,\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The following table shows the expected value ''E'' of the game with various potential bankers and their bankroll ''W'' (with the assumption that if you win more than the bankroll you will be paid what the bank has):

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:right;"

A rational person might not find the lottery worth even the modest amounts in the above table, suggesting that the naive decision model of the expected return causes essentially the same problems as for the infinite lottery. Even so, the possible discrepancy between theory and reality is far less dramatic.

The premise of infinite resources produces a variety of paradoxes in economics. In the [[Martingale (betting system)|martingale betting system]], a gambler betting on a tossed coin doubles his bet after every loss, so that an eventual win would cover all losses; this system fails with any finite bankroll. The [[gambler's ruin]] concept shows a persistent gambler will go broke, even if the game provides a positive [[expected value]], and [[Impossibility of a gambling system|no betting system]] can avoid this inevitability.

== Recent discussions ==
Although this paradox is three centuries old, new arguments are still being introduced.

=== Feller ===
A mathematically correct solution is sampling by [[William Feller]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications Volume I.|last=Feller|first=William|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In order to understand Feller's answer correctly, sufficient knowledge about probability theory and statistics is necessary, but it can be understood intuitively "to perform this game with a large number of people and calculate the expected value from the sample extraction". In this method, when the games of infinite number of times are possible, the expected value will be infinity, and in the case of finite, the expected value will be a small value.

=== Samuelson ===
Samuelson resolves the paradox by arguing that, even if an entity had infinite resources, the game would never be offered. If the lottery represents an infinite expected gain to the player, then it also represents an infinite expected loss to the host.  No one could be observed paying to play the game because it would never be offered. As [[Paul Samuelson]] describes the argument:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Paul will never be willing to give as much as Peter will demand for such a contract; and hence the indicated activity will take place at the equilibrium level of zero intensity." {{harv|Samuelson|1960}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Peters ===
[[Ole Peters]] thinks that the St. Petersburg paradox can be solved by using concepts and ideas from [[ergodic theory]] {{harv|Peters|2011a}}. In [[statistical mechanics]] it is a central problem to understand whether time averages resulting from a long observation of a single system are equivalent to expectation values. This is the case only for a very limited class of systems that are called "[[ergodic]]." For non-ergodic systems there is no general reason why expectation values should have any relevance.

Peters points out that computing the naive expected payout is mathematically equivalent to considering multiple outcomes of the same lottery in parallel universes. This is irrelevant to the individual considering whether to buy a ticket since he exists in only one universe and is unable to exchange resources with the others. It is therefore unclear why expected wealth should be a quantity whose maximization should lead to a sound decision theory. Indeed, the St. Petersburg paradox is only a paradox if one accepts the premise that rational actors seek to maximize their expected wealth. The classical resolution is to apply a utility function to the wealth, which reflects the notion that the "usefulness" of an amount of money depends on how much of it one already has, and then to maximise the expectation of this. The choice of utility function is often framed in terms of the individual's risk preferences and may vary between individuals: it therefore provides a somewhat arbitrary framework for the treatment of the problem.

An alternative premise, which is less arbitrary and makes fewer assumptions, is that the performance ''over time'' of an investment better characterises an investor's prospects and, therefore, better informs his investment decision. In this case, the passage of time is incorporated by identifying as the quantity of interest the average ''rate'' of exponential growth of the player's wealth in a single round of the lottery,

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{g}(w,c) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty p_k \ln \left(\frac{w-c+D_k}{w}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

per round, where ''D&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''k''th (positive finite) payout, ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the (non-zero) probability of receiving it, ''w'' is the wealth of the player, and ''c'' is the cost of a ticket. In the standard St. Petersburg lottery, {{nowrap|''D&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''k'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{nowrap|''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Although this is an expectation value of a growth rate, and may therefore be thought of in one sense as an average over parallel universes, it is in fact equivalent to the time average growth rate that would be obtained if repeated lotteries were played over time {{harv|Peters|2011a}}. While {{overline|''g''}} is identical to the rate of change of the expected logarithmic utility, it has been obtained without making any assumptions about the player's risk preferences or behaviour, other than that he is interested in the rate of growth of his wealth.

Under this paradigm, an individual with wealth ''w'' should buy a ticket at a price ''c'' provided

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{g}(w,c)&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

This strategy counsels against paying any amount of money for a ticket that admits the possibility of bankruptcy, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;w-c+D_k = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

for any ''k'', since this generates a negatively divergent logarithm in the sum for {{overline|''g''}} which can be shown to dominate all other terms in the sum and guarantee that {{overline|''g''}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0. If we assume the smallest payout is ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then the individual will always be advised to decline the ticket at any price greater than

:&lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm{max} = w+D_1,&lt;/math&gt;

''regardless'' of the payout structure of the lottery. The ticket price for which the expected growth rate falls to zero will be less than ''c''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; but may be greater than ''w'', indicating that borrowing money to purchase a ticket for more than one's wealth can be a sound decision. This would be the case, for example, where the smallest payout exceeds the player's current wealth, as it does in Menger's game.

It should also be noted in the above treatment that, contrary to Menger's analysis, no higher-paying lottery can generate a paradox which the time resolution – or, equivalently, Bernoulli's or Laplace's logarithmic resolutions – fail to resolve, since there is ''always'' a price at which the lottery should not be entered, even though for especially favourable lotteries this may be greater than one's worth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7370">The '''Stanley–Wilf conjecture''', formulated independently by [[Richard P. Stanley]] and [[Herbert Wilf]] in the late 1980s, states that the growth rate of every proper [[permutation class]] is [[Exponential growth|singly exponential]]. It was proved by {{harvs|first1=Adam|last1=Marcus|author1-link=Adam Marcus (mathematician)|first2=Gábor|last2=Tardos|author2-link=Gábor Tardos|year=2004|txt}} and is no longer a conjecture.  Marcus and Tardos actually proved a different conjecture, due to {{harvs|first1=Zoltán|last1=Füredi|author1-link=Zoltán Füredi|first2=Péter|last2=Hajnal|year=1992|txt}}, which had been shown to imply the Stanley–Wilf conjecture by {{harvtxt|Klazar|2000}}.

==Statement==
The Stanley–Wilf conjecture states that for every permutation ''β'', there is a constant ''C'' such that the number |''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''β'')| of permutations of length ''n'' which avoid ''β'' as a [[permutation pattern]] is at most ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. As {{harvtxt|Arratia|1999}} observed, this is equivalent to the convergence of the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]]
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{|S_n(\beta)|}.&lt;/math&gt;

The upper bound given by Marcus and Tardos for ''C'' is [[Exponential function|exponential]] in the length of ''β''.  A stronger conjecture of {{harvtxt|Arratia|1999}} had stated that one could take ''C'' to be {{Nowrap|(''k'' − 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where ''k'' denotes the length of ''β'', but this conjecture was disproved for the permutation {{Nowrap|1=''β'' = 4231}} by {{harvtxt|Albert|Elder|Rechnitzer|Westcott|2006}}. Indeed, {{harvtxt|Fox|2013}} has shown that ''C'' is, in fact, exponential in ''k'' for [[almost all]] permutations.

==Allowable growth rates==
The '''growth rate''' (or Stanley–Wilf limit) of a permutation class is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{a_n},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the number of permutations of length ''n'' in the class. Clearly not every positive real number can be a growth rate of a permutation class, regardless of whether it is defined by a single forbidden permutation pattern or a set of forbidden patterns. For example, numbers strictly between 0 and 1 cannot be growth rates of permutation classes.

{{harvtxt|Kaiser|Klazar|2002}} proved that if the number of permutations in a class of length ''n'' is ever less than the ''n''th [[Fibonacci number]] then the enumeration of the class is eventually polynomial. Therefore, numbers strictly between 1 and the [[golden ratio]] also cannot be growth rates of permutation classes. Kaiser and Klazar went on to establish every possible growth constant of a permutation class below 2; these are the largest real roots of the polynomials
:&lt;math&gt;x^{k+1}-2x^k+1&lt;/math&gt;
for an integer ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2. This shows that 2 is the least accumulation point of growth rates of permutation classes.

{{harvtxt|Vatter|2011}} later extended the characterization of growth rates of permutation classes up to κ≈2.20, from which it follows that κ is the least accumulation point of accumulation points of growth rates. The growth rates between 2 and κ are also algebraic. {{harvtxt|Vatter|2010}} also proved that every real number at least 2.49 is the growth rate of a permutation class. {{harvtxt|Bevan|2014}} has since improved on that result, showing that every real number at least 2.36 is the growth rate of a permutation class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6265">In mathematics, the '''Szpilrajn extension theorem''', due to {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Edward Szpilrajn|first=Edward |last=Szpilrajn|year=1930}} (later called Edward Marczewski), is one of many examples of the use of the [[axiom of choice]] (in the form of [[Zorn's lemma]]) to find a maximal set with certain properties.

The theorem states that every [[strict partial order]] is contained into a [[total order]], where:

* a strict partial order is an [[Reflexive relation|irreflexive]] and [[Transitive relation|transitive]] relation
* a total order is a strict partial order that is also a [[connex relation]]

Intuitively, the theorem states that a comparison between elements that leaves some pairs incomparable can be extended in such a way every element is either less than or greater than another.

== Definitions and statement ==

A [[binary relation]] ''R'' over a set ''S'' is formally defined as a set of pairs of elements ''&lt;x,y&gt;'' where ''x, y ∈ S''. The condition ''&lt;x,y&gt; ∈ R'' is generally abbreviated ''xRy''.

A relation is [[reflexive relation|irreflexive]] if ''xRx'' holds for no element ''x ∈ S''. It is [[transitive relation|transitive]] if ''xRy'' and ''yRz'' imply ''xRz''. It is [[total relation|total]] if either ''xRy'' or ''yRx'' holds for every pair of elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''S''.

If a relation ''R'' is contained in another ''T'' then every pair in the first is also in the second. As a result, ''xRy'' implies ''xTy'', which can be taken as an alternative definition of containment.

The extension theorem tells that every relation ''R'' that is non-reflexive and transitive (a strict partial order) is contained in another ''T'' that is still non-reflexive and transitive but also total (a total order).

== Proof ==

The theorem is proved in two steps: first, if a strict partial order does not compare ''x'' and ''y'', it can be extended by first adding the pair ''&amp;lang; x,y &amp;rang;'' and then performing the [[transitive closure]]; second, since this operation generates an ordering that strictly contains the original one and can be applied to all pairs of incomparable elements, there exists a relation in which all pairs of elements have been made comparable.

The first step is proved as a preliminary lemma, in which a strict partial order where a pair of elements ''x'' and ''y'' are incomparable is changed to make them comparable. This is obtained by first adding the pair ''xRy'' to the relation, which may result in a non-transitive relation, and then restoring transitivity by adding all pairs ''qRy'' such that ''qRx'', all pairs ''xRp'' such that ''yRp'', as well as all pairs ''qRp'' such that ''qRx'' and ''yRp''. This is done on a single pair of incomparable elements ''x'' and ''y'', but produces a relation that is still irreflexive and transitive and that strictly contains the original one because at least the pair ''xRy'' has been added. Some other pairs of elements may still be incomparable, but the change can be performed on it again.

The extension theorem is then proved by showing that the set of strict partial orders containing ''R'' has some maximal element. If such an element had a pair of incomparable elements the transformation could be applied to it, resulting in a relation that strictly contains it. This would contradict maximality.

The existence of a maximal elements is proved via [[Zorn's lemma]]. In this context, it is applied to the set of all strict orders extending ''R'', compared by set inclusion. A chain is therefore a sequence of relations, each extending ''R'' and contained in the following one. The lemma can be applied if every chain of relations extending ''R'' has an upper bound which is also a strict partial order extending ''R''.

In other words, this upper bound should be a superset of the original relation, which is the case because every member of the chain contains it, and also a strict partial order: non-reflexive and transitive. The first holds because every element of the chain is a strict partial order, so none of the relations of the chain contains such a pair. Transitivity holds because the pairs ''&amp;lang; x,y &amp;rang;'' and ''&amp;lang; y,z &amp;rang;'' are in the union only if the first is in some relation of the chain and the second in some other. Being a chain, either the first relation is contained in the second or the second in the first. In the first case, ''&amp;lang; x,y &amp;rang;'' is also in the second relation. Since all relations produced by the transformation are transitive, ''&amp;lang; x,z &amp;rang;'' is in the second relation and therefore also in the union. A similar argument holds if the second relation is contained in the first.

By Zorn's lemma, the set of strict partial orders extending the original relation ''R'' has a maximal element ''Q'', which is also a strict partial order extending ''R''. This relation ''Q'' is proved to be total: if it had a pair of incomparable elements then the transformation could be applied to it, leading to another strict partial order that extends ''R'' and strictly contains ''Q'', therefore contradicting the assumption that the ''Q'' is maximal in the set of strict partial orders extending ''R''. This proves that ''Q'' has no pair of incomparable elements, in addition to being a strict partial order extending ''R''. As a result, it is a total order extending ''R''.

==Other extension theorems==

* Arrow stated that every [[quasiorder]] (reflexive and transitive relation) can be extended to a [[total order]] (reflexitive, transitive and connex relation); this claim was later proved by Hansson
* Suzumura proved that a binary relation can be extended to form a [[total order]] if and only if it is Suzumura-consistent: no cycle of elements exists such that ''xRy'' for every pair of consecutive elements ''x'' and ''y'' and for some pair of consecutive elements ''yRx'' does not hold

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4896">[[Image:Intrinsic coordinates (Whewell equation).png|thumb|The tangential angle {{mvar|φ}} for an arbitrary curve {{mvar|P}}.]]
In [[geometry]], the '''tangential angle''' of a curve in the Cartesian plane, at a specific point, is the angle between the tangent line to the curve at the given point and the {{mvar|x}}-axis.&lt;ref name="mwne"&gt;{{MathWorld|NaturalEquation|Natural Equation}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that some authors define the angle as the deviation from the direction of the curve at some fixed starting point. This is equivalent to the definition given here by the addition of a constant to the angle or by rotating the curve.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite journal|first=W. |last=Whewell |title=Of the Intrinsic Equation of a Curve, and Its Application |journal=Cambridge Philosophical Transactions |volume=8 |date=1849 |pages=659–671 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vsIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA659}} This paper uses {{mvar|φ}} to mean the angle between the tangent and tangent at the origin. This is the paper introducing the Whewell equation, an application of the tangential angle.&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Equations ==
If a curve is given parametrically by {{math|(''x''(''t''), ''y''(''t''))}}, then the tangential angle {{mvar|φ}} at {{mvar|t}} is defined (up to a multiple of {{math|2π}}) by&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|TangentialAngle|Tangential Angle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\big(x'(t),\ y'(t)\big)}{\big|x'(t),\ y'(t)\big|} = (\cos \varphi,\ \sin \varphi).&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the [[Prime (symbol)|prime symbol]] denotes the [[derivative]] with respect to {{mvar|t}}. Thus, the tangential angle specifies the direction of the [[velocity]] vector {{math|(''x''(''t''), ''y''(''t''))}}, while the [[speed]] specifies its magnitude. The vector

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\big(x'(t),\ y'(t)\big)}{\big|x'(t),\ y'(t)\big|}&lt;/math&gt;

is called the [[unit tangent vector]], so an equivalent definition is that the tangential angle at {{mvar|t}} is the angle {{mvar|φ}} such that {{math|(cos ''φ'', sin ''φ'')}} is the unit tangent vector at {{mvar|t}}.

If the curve is parametrized by [[arc length]] {{mvar|s}}, so {{math|{{abs|''x''′(''s''), ''y''′(''s'')}} {{=}} 1}}, then the definition simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;\big(x'(s),\ y'(s)\big) = (\cos \varphi,\ \sin \varphi).&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the [[curvature]] {{mvar|κ}} is given by {{math|''φ''′(''s'')}}, where {{mvar|κ}} is taken to be positive if the curve bends to the left and negative if the curve bends to the right.&lt;ref name="mwne"/&gt;

If the curve is given by {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}}, then we may take {{math|(''x'', ''f''(''x''))}} as the parametrization, and we may assume {{mvar|φ}} is between {{math|−{{sfrac|π|2}}}} and {{math|{{sfrac|π|2}}}}. This produces the explicit expression

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \arctan f'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

== {{anchor|Polar}}Polar tangential angle&lt;ref name="williamson"/&gt; ==
In [[polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]], the '''polar tangential angle''' is defined as the angle between the tangent line to the curve at the given point and ray from the origin to the point.&lt;ref name="Planet"&gt;{{PlanetMath|urlname=LogarithmicSpiral|title=Logarithmic Spiral}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{mvar|ψ}} denotes the polar tangential angle, then {{math|''ψ'' {{=}} ''φ'' − ''θ''}}, where {{mvar|φ}} is as above and {{mvar|θ}} is, as usual, the polar angle.

If the curve is defined in polar coordinates by {{math|''r'' {{=}} ''f''(''θ'')}}, then the polar tangential angle {{mvar|ψ}} at {{mvar|θ}} is defined (up to a multiple of {{math|2π}}) by

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\big(f'(\theta),\ f(\theta)\big)}{\big|f'(\theta),\ f(\theta)\big|} = (\cos \psi,\ \sin \psi)&lt;/math&gt;.

If the curve is parametrized by arc length {{mvar|s}} as {{math|''r'' {{=}} ''r''(''s'')}}, {{math|''θ'' {{=}} ''θ''(''s'')}}, so {{math|{{abs|''r''′(''s''), ''rθ''′(''s'')}} {{=}} 1}}, then the definition becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\big(r'(s),\ r\theta'(s)\big) = (\cos \psi,\ \sin \psi)&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[logarithmic spiral]] can be defined a curve whose polar tangential angle is constant.&lt;ref name="williamson"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Angle between Tangent and Radius Vector |title=An Elementary Treatise on the Differential Calculus |first=Benjamin |last=Williamson |page=222 |edition=9th |date=1899 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYkAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Planet"/&gt;

'''''The Fourth Dimension''''' is a [[non-fiction]] work written by [[Rudy Rucker]], the [[Silicon Valley]] professor of mathematics and computer science, and was published in 1984 by Houghton Mifflin. The book is subtitled as a guided tour of the higher universes. The foreword included is by [[Martin Gardner]], and the 200+ illustrations are by David Povilaitis. Like other books by Rucker, ''The Fourth Dimension'' is dedicated to [[Edwin Abbott Abbott]], author of the novella ''[[Flatland]]''.

==Synopsis==
''The Fourth Dimension'' teaches readers about the concept of a fourth spatial dimension. Several analogies are made to ''Flatland''; in particular, Rucker compares how a square in Flatland would react to a cube in Spaceland to how a cube in Spaceland would react to a [[hypercube]] from the fourth dimension.

The book also includes multiple puzzles.

==Reception==
''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called it "animated, often amusing", and a "rare treat", but noted that the book eventually leaves mathematical topics behind to focus instead on "mysticism of the all-is-one-one-is-all thinking of an [[Ouspensky]]."&lt;ref name=Kirkus&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/rudy-rucker-2/the-fourth-dimension-toward-a-geometry-of-highe/ THE FOURTH DIMENSION: Toward a Geometry of Higher Reality], reviewed at ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''; published October 8, 1984; retrieved June 27, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The  ''[[Quarterly Review of Biology]]'' declared it to be "nice", and "at times (...) enchanting", comparing it to ''[[The Tao of Physics]]''.&lt;ref name=QRoB&gt;[Scott Ferson, "The Fourth Dimension: Toward a Geometry of Higher Reality.

[[Image:Möbius strip.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Möbius strip]]s, which have only one surface and one edge, are a kind of object studied in topology.]]

In [[mathematics]], '''topology''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] τόπος, ''place'', and λόγος, ''study'') is concerned with the properties of [[Space (mathematics)|space]] that are preserved under [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[Deformation theory|deformations]], such as [[stretching]], twisting, [[crumpling]] and bending, but not [[tearing]] or [[Quotient space (topology)|gluing]]. 

An [[Dimension|n-dimensional]] topological space is a space (not necessarily [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]]) with certain properties of [[connectedness]] and [[compact (topology)|compactness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/topology|title=the definition of topology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The space may be [[Differentiable function|continuous]] (like all [[Point (geometry)|points]] on a rubber sheet), or [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] (like the set of [[integer]]s). It can be [[Open set|open]] (like the set of points inside a [[circle]]) or [[Closed set|closed]] (like the set of points inside a circle, together with the points on the circle).

Topology developed as a field of study out of [[geometry]] and [[set theory]], through analysis of concepts such as space, dimension, and transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.wayne.edu/~rrb/topology.html |title= What is Topology? A short and idiosyncratic answer |first=Robert |last=Bruner |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such ideas go back to [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who in the 17th century envisioned the ''geometria situs'' (Greek-Latin for "geometry of place") and ''analysis situs'' (Greek-Latin for "picking apart of place").  [[Leonhard Euler]]'s [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]] Problem and [[Euler characteristic#Polyhedra|Polyhedron Formula]] are arguably the field's first theorems. The term ''topology'' was introduced by [[Johann Benedict Listing]] in the 19th century, although it was not until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a topological space was developed.  By the middle of the 20th century, topology had become a major branch of mathematics.

==History==
[[Image:Konigsberg bridges.png|thumb|right|240px|The [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]] was a problem solved by Euler.]]

Topology, as a well-defined mathematical discipline, originates in the early part of the twentieth century, but some isolated results can be traced back several centuries.&lt;ref name=Croom7&gt;{{harvnb|Croom|1989|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these are certain questions in geometry investigated by Leonhard Euler. His 1736 paper on the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]] is regarded as one of the first practical applications of topology.&lt;ref name=Croom7 /&gt; On 14 November 1750 Euler wrote to a friend that he had realised the importance of the ''edges'' of a [[polyhedron]]. This led to his [[Euler's polyhedron formula|polyhedron formula]], ''V'' − ''E'' + ''F'' = 2 (where ''V'', ''E'' and ''F'' respectively indicate the number of vertices, edges and faces of the polyhedron). Some authorities regard this analysis as the first theorem, signalling the birth of topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richeson|2008|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aleksandrov|1969|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further contributions were made by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], [[Ludwig Schläfli]], [[Johann Benedict Listing]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[Enrico Betti]].&lt;ref name="Richeson"&gt;Richeson (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Listing introduced the term "Topologie" in ''Vorstudien zur Topologie'', written in his native German, in 1847, having used the word for ten years in correspondence before its first appearance in print.&lt;ref&gt;Listing, Johann Benedict, "Vorstudien zur Topologie", Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, Göttingen, p.&amp;nbsp;67, 1848&lt;/ref&gt; The English form "topology" was used in 1883 in Listing's obituary in the journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] to distinguish "qualitative geometry from the ordinary geometry in which quantitative relations chiefly are treated".&lt;ref&gt;Tait, Peter Guthrie, "Johann Benedict Listing (obituary)", Nature '''27''', 1 February 1883, pp. 316–317&lt;/ref&gt; The term "topologist" in the sense of a specialist in topology was used in 1905 in the magazine ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Their work was corrected, consolidated and greatly extended by [[Henri Poincaré]]. In 1895 he published his ground-breaking paper on ''[[Analysis Situs (paper)|Analysis Situs]]'', which introduced the concepts now known as [[homotopy]] and [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]], which are now considered part of [[algebraic topology]].&lt;ref name="Richeson"/&gt;

Unifying the work on function spaces of [[Georg Cantor]], [[Vito Volterra]], [[Cesare Arzelà]], [[Jacques Hadamard]], [[Giulio Ascoli]] and others, [[Maurice Fréchet]] introduced the [[metric space]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fréchet |first=Maurice |title=Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel |work=PhD dissertation |year=1906 |oclc=8897542 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A metric space is now considered a special case of a general topological space, with any given topological space potentially giving rise to many distinct metric spaces. In 1914, [[Felix Hausdorff]] coined the term "topological space" and gave the definition for what is now called a [[Hausdorff space]].&lt;ref&gt;Hausdorff, Felix, "Grundzüge der Mengenlehre", Leipzig: Veit. In (Hausdorff Werke, II (2002), 91–576)&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, a topological space is a slight generalization of Hausdorff spaces, given in 1922 by [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Croom|1989|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern topology depends strongly on the ideas of set theory, developed by Georg Cantor in the later part of the 19th century. In addition to establishing the basic ideas of set theory, Cantor considered point sets in [[Euclidean space]] as part of his study of [[Fourier series]]. For further developments, see [[point-set topology]] and algebraic topology.

==Introduction==
Topology can be formally defined as "the study of qualitative properties of certain objects (called [[topological space]]s) that are [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under a certain kind of transformation (called a [[continuous map]]), especially those properties that are invariant under a certain kind of invertible transformation (called [[homeomorphism]]s)."

Topology is also used to refer to a structure imposed upon a set ''X'', a structure that essentially 'characterizes' the set ''X'' as a topological space by taking proper care of properties such as [[limit of a sequence|convergence]], connectedness and [[continuous function (topology)|continuity]], upon transformation.

Topological spaces show up naturally in almost every branch of mathematics. This has made topology one of the great unifying ideas of mathematics.

The motivating insight behind topology is that some geometric problems depend not on the exact shape of the objects involved, but rather on the way they are put together. For example, the square and the circle have many properties in common: they are both one dimensional objects (from a topological point of view) and both separate the plane into two parts, the part inside and the part outside.

In one of the first papers in topology, Leonhard Euler demonstrated that it was impossible to find a route through the town of Königsberg (now [[Kaliningrad]]) that would cross each of its seven bridges exactly once. This result did not depend on the lengths of the bridges, nor on their distance from one another, but only on connectivity properties: which bridges connect to which islands or riverbanks. This problem in introductory mathematics called ''[[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]]'' led to the branch of mathematics known as [[graph theory]].

[[Image:Mug and Torus morph.gif|thumb|right|240px|A continuous deformation (a type of homeomorphism) of a mug into a doughnut (torus) and back]]

Similarly, the [[hairy ball theorem]] of algebraic topology says that "one cannot comb the hair flat on a hairy ball without creating a [[cowlick]]." This fact is immediately convincing to most people, even though they might not recognize the more formal statement of the theorem, that there is no nonvanishing continuous [[vector field|tangent vector field]] on the sphere. As with the ''Bridges of Königsberg'', the result does not depend on the shape of the sphere; it applies to any kind of smooth blob, as long as it has no holes.

To deal with these problems that do not rely on the exact shape of the objects, one must be clear about just what properties these problems ''do'' rely on. From this need arises the notion of homeomorphism. The impossibility of crossing each bridge just once applies to any arrangement of bridges homeomorphic to those in Königsberg, and the hairy ball theorem applies to any space homeomorphic to a sphere.

Intuitively, two spaces are homeomorphic if one can be deformed into the other without cutting or gluing. A traditional joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a coffee mug from a doughnut, since a sufficiently pliable doughnut could be reshaped to a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while shrinking the hole into a handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHBj2oaSALoC&amp;pg=PA204|title=Differential Equations: A Dynamical Systems Approach. Part II: Higher-Dimensional Systems|last1=Hubbard|first1=John H.|last2=West|first2=Beverly H.|publisher=Springer|year=1995|isbn=978-0-387-94377-0|series=Texts in Applied Mathematics|volume=18|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeomorphism can be considered the most basic [[Homeomorphism|topological equivalence]]. Another is [[homotopy equivalence]]. This is harder to describe without getting technical, but the essential notion is that two objects are homotopy equivalent if they both result from "squishing" some larger object.

An introductory [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] is to classify the uppercase letters of the [[English alphabet]] according to homeomorphism and homotopy equivalence. The result depends partially on the font used. The figures use the [[sans-serif]] [[Myriad (font)|Myriad]] [[font]]. Homotopy equivalence is a rougher relationship than homeomorphism; a homotopy equivalence class can contain several homeomorphism classes. The simple case of homotopy equivalence described above can be used here to show two letters are homotopy equivalent. For example, O fits inside P and the tail of the P can be squished to the "hole" part.

Homeomorphism classes are:
*no holes corresponding with C, G, I, J, L, M, N, S, U, V, W, and Z;
*no holes and three tails corresponding with E, F, T, and Y {{clarify|date=December 2017|reason=couldn't this be split into two classes: a bar with three tails and a point with three tails (or equivalently a line with two tails)?}};
*no holes and four tails corresponding with X;
*one hole and no tail corresponding with D and O;
*one hole and one tail corresponding with P and Q;
*one hole and two tails corresponding with A and R;
*two holes and no tail corresponding with B; and
*a bar with four tails corresponding with H and K; the "bar" on the ''K'' is almost too short to see.

Homotopy classes are larger, because the tails can be squished down to a point. They are:
*one hole,
*two holes, and
*no holes.

To classify the letters correctly, we must show that two letters in the same class are equivalent and two letters in different classes are not equivalent. In the case of homeomorphism, this can be done by selecting points and showing their removal disconnects the letters differently. For example, X and Y are not homeomorphic because removing the center point of the X leaves four pieces; whatever point in Y corresponds to this point, its removal can leave at most three pieces. The case of homotopy equivalence is harder and requires a more elaborate argument showing an algebraic invariant, such as the [[fundamental group]], is different on the supposedly differing classes.

Letter topology has practical relevance in [[stencil]] [[typography]]. For instance, [[Braggadocio (typeface)|Braggadocio]] font stencils are made of one connected piece of material.

==Concepts==

===Topologies on sets===
{{Main|Topological space}}

The term '''topology''' also refers to a specific mathematical idea central to the area of mathematics called topology. Informally, a topology tells how elements of a set relate spatially to each other. The same set can have different topologies. For instance, the [[real line]], the [[complex plane]] (which is a 1-dimensional complex vector space), and the [[Cantor set]] can be thought of as the same set with different topologies.

Formally, let ''X'' be a set and let ''τ'' be a [[family of sets|family]] of subsets of ''X''. Then ''τ'' is called a ''topology on X'' if:

# Both the empty set and ''X'' are elements of ''τ''.
# Any union of elements of ''τ'' is an element of ''τ''.
# Any intersection of finitely many elements of ''τ'' is an element of ''τ''.

If ''τ'' is a topology on ''X'', then the pair (''X'', ''τ'') is called a topological space. The notation ''X&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;'' may be used to denote a set ''X'' endowed with the particular topology ''τ''.

The members of ''τ'' are called ''open sets'' in ''X''. A subset of ''X'' is said to be closed if its complement is in ''τ'' (i.e., its complement is open). A subset of ''X'' may be open, closed, both ([[clopen set]]), or neither. The empty set and ''X'' itself are always both closed and open. A subset of ''X'' including an open set containing a point ''x'' is called a '[[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]]' of ''x''.

===Continuous functions and homeomorphisms===
{{Main|Continuous function|homeomorphism}}
A [[function (mathematics)|function]] or map from one topological space to another is called ''continuous'' if the inverse image of any open set is open. If the function maps the [[real number]]s to the real numbers (both spaces with the standard topology), then this definition of continuous is equivalent to the definition of continuous in [[calculus]]. If a continuous function is [[injective function|one-to-one]] and [[surjective function|onto]], and if the inverse of the function is also continuous, then the function is called a homeomorphism and the domain of the function is said to be homeomorphic to the range. Another way of saying this is that the function has a natural extension to the topology. If two spaces are homeomorphic, they have identical topological properties, and are considered topologically the same. The cube and the sphere are homeomorphic, as are the coffee cup and the doughnut. But the circle is not homeomorphic to the doughnut.

===Manifolds===
{{Main|Manifold}}
While topological spaces can be extremely varied and exotic, many areas of topology focus on the more familiar class of spaces known as manifolds. A '''manifold''' is a topological space that resembles Euclidean space near each point.  More precisely, each point of an ''n''-dimensional manifold has a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] that is [[homeomorphic]] to the Euclidean space of dimension ''n''.  [[Line (geometry)|Lines]] and [[circle]]s, but not [[Lemniscate|figure eights]], are one-dimensional manifolds.  Two-dimensional manifolds are also called [[Surface (topology)|surfaces]].  Examples include the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], the sphere, and the torus, which can all be realized without self-intersection in three dimensions, but also the Klein bottle and [[real projective plane]], which cannot.

==Topics==

===General topology===
{{Main|General topology}}
'''General topology''' is the branch of topology dealing with the basic set-theoretic definitions and constructions used in topology.&lt;ref&gt;Munkres, James R. Topology. Vol. 2. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Colin Conrad, and Robert David Franzosa. Introduction to topology: pure and applied. Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the foundation of most other branches of topology, including differential topology, geometric topology, and algebraic topology. Another name for general topology is '''point-set topology'''.

The fundamental concepts in point-set topology are ''continuity'', ''compactness'', and ''connectedness''. Intuitively, continuous functions take nearby points to nearby points. Compact sets are those that can be covered by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size. Connected sets are sets that cannot be divided into two pieces that are far apart. The words ''nearby'', ''arbitrarily small'', and ''far apart'' can all be made precise by using open sets. If we change the definition of ''open set'', we change what continuous functions, compact sets, and connected sets are. Each choice of definition for ''open set'' is called a ''topology''. A set with a topology is called a ''topological space''.

''Metric spaces'' are an important class of topological spaces where distances can be assigned a number called a ''metric''. Having a metric simplifies many proofs, and many of the most common topological spaces are metric spaces.

===Algebraic topology===
{{Main|Algebraic topology}}
'''Algebraic topology''' is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from [[abstract algebra]] to study topological spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Hatcher, [http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html ''Algebraic topology.''] (2002) Cambridge University Press, xii+544 pp.&amp;nbsp;{{isbn|0-521-79160-X}} and {{isbn|0-521-79540-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that [[classification theorem|classify]] topological spaces [[up to]] homeomorphism, though usually most classify up to homotopy equivalence.

The most important of these invariants are [[homotopy group]]s, homology, and [[cohomology]].

Although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems, using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible. Algebraic topology, for example, allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a [[free group]] is again a free group.

===Differential topology===
{{Main|Differential topology}}
'''Differential topology''' is the field dealing with [[differentiable function]]s on [[differentiable manifold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = John M. | last = Lee | year = 2006 | title = Introduction to Smooth Manifolds | publisher = Springer-Verlag | isbn = 978-0-387-95448-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to [[differential geometry]] and together they make up the geometric theory of differentiable manifolds.

More specifically, differential topology considers the properties and structures that require only a [[smooth structure]] on a manifold to be defined.  Smooth manifolds are 'softer' than manifolds with extra geometric structures, which can act as obstructions to certain types of equivalences and [[Deformation theory|deformations]] that exist in differential topology. For instance, volume and [[Riemannian curvature]] are invariants that can distinguish different geometric structures on the same smooth manifold—that is, one can smoothly "flatten out" certain manifolds, but it might require distorting the space and affecting the curvature or volume.

===Geometric topology===
{{Main|Geometric topology}}

'''Geometric topology''' is a branch of topology that primarily focuses on low-dimensional [[Manifold|manifolds]] (i.e. spaces of dimensions 2,3 and 4) and their interaction with geometry, but it also includes some higher-dimensional topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url        = http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/2840/what-is-geometric-topology

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Sher and R.J. Daverman (2002), ''Handbook of Geometric Topology'', North-Holland. {{isbn|0-444-82432-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of topics in geometric topology are [[Orientable manifold|orientability]], [[handle decomposition]]s, [[local flatness]], crumpling and the planar and higher-dimensional [[Jordan-Schönflies theorem|Schönflies theorem]].

In high-dimensional topology, [[characteristic classes]] are a basic invariant, and [[surgery theory]] is a key theory.

Low-dimensional topology is strongly geometric, as reflected in the [[uniformization theorem]] in 2 dimensions – every surface admits a constant curvature metric; geometrically, it has one of 3 possible geometries: positive [[curvature]]/spherical, zero curvature/flat, negative curvature/hyperbolic – and the [[geometrization conjecture]] (now theorem) in 3 dimensions – every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces, each of which has one of eight possible geometries.

2-dimensional topology can be studied as [[complex geometry]] in one variable ([[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] surfaces are complex curves) – by the uniformization theorem every [[Conformal geometry|conformal class]] of [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] is equivalent to a unique complex one, and 4-dimensional topology can be studied from the point of view of complex geometry in two variables (complex surfaces), though not every 4-manifold admits a complex structure.

===Generalizations===
Occasionally, one needs to use the tools of topology but a "set of points" is not available. In [[pointless topology]] one considers instead the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] of open sets as the basic notion of the theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnstone | first1 = Peter T. | authorlink = Peter Johnstone (mathematician) | year = 1983 | title = The point of pointless topology | url = http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&amp;id=pdf_1&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183550014 | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 41–53 | doi = 10.1090/s0273-0979-1983-15080-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Grothendieck topology|Grothendieck topologies]] are structures defined on arbitrary [[category theory|categories]] that allow the definition of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] on those categories, and with that the definition of general cohomology theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Artin | first1=Michael | author1-link=Michael Artin | title=Grothendieck topologies | publisher=Harvard University, Dept. of Mathematics | year=1962 | zbl=0208.48701 | location=Cambridge, MA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Biology===

[[Knot theory]], a branch of topology, is used in biology to study the effects of certain enzymes on DNA. These enzymes cut, twist, and reconnect the DNA, causing knotting with observable effects such as slower [[electrophoresis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Colin |last= Adams|author-link=Colin Adams (mathematician)|title=The Knot Book: An Elementary Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of Knots |publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8218-3678-1|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topology is also used in [[evolutionary biology]] to represent the relationship between [[phenotype]] and [[genotype]].&lt;ref name=bstadler2001&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/jtbi.2001.2423 |pmid=11894994 |title=The Topology of the Possible: Formal Spaces Underlying Patterns of Evolutionary Change |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=213 |issue=2 |pages=241–274 |year=2001 |last1=Stadler |first1=Bärbel M.R. |last2=Stadler |first2=Peter F. |last3=Wagner |first3=Günter P. |last4=Fontana |first4=Walter |citeseerx=10.1.1.63.7808 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phenotypic forms that appear quite different can be separated by only a few mutations depending on how genetic changes map to phenotypic changes during development. In neuroscience, topological quantities like the Euler characteristic and Betti number have been used to measure the complexity of patterns of activity in neural networks.

===Computer science===

[[Topological data analysis]] uses techniques from algebraic topology to determine the large scale structure of a set (for instance, determining if a cloud of points is spherical or [[torus|toroidal]]). The main method used by topological data analysis is:
# Replace a set of data points with a family of [[simplicial complex]]es, indexed by a proximity parameter.
# Analyse these topological complexes via algebraic topology – specifically, via the theory of [[persistent homology]].&lt;ref name=carlsson2009&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/2009-46-02/S0273-0979-09-01249-X/S0273-0979-09-01249-X.pdf|title=Topology and data|author=Gunnar Carlsson|journal=Bulletin (New Series) of the American Mathematical Society|volume=46|issue=2|date=April 2009|pages=255–308|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-09-01249-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Encode the persistent homology of a data set in the form of a parameterized version of a [[Betti number]], which is called a '''barcode'''.&lt;ref name=carlsson2009/&gt;

=== Physics ===
Topology is relevant to physics in areas such as [[condensed matter physics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2016|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2016/press.html|publisher=Nobel Foundation|date=4 October 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[quantum field theory]] and [[physical cosmology]].

The topological dependence of mechanical properties in solids is of interest in disciplines of [[mechanical engineering]] and [[materials science]]. Electrical and mechanical properties depend on the arrangement and network structures of [[molecules]] and elementary units in materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephenson|first1=C.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Topological properties of a self-assembled electrical network via ab initio calculation|journal=Sci.

A '''[[topological quantum field theory]]''' (or '''topological field theory''' or '''TQFT''') is a quantum field theory that computes [[topological invariant]]s.

Although TQFTs were invented by physicists, they are also of mathematical interest, being related to, among other things, [[knot theory]], the theory of [[four-manifold]]s in algebraic topology, and to the theory of [[moduli spaces]] in algebraic geometry. [[Simon Donaldson|Donaldson]], [[Vaughan Jones|Jones]], [[Edward Witten|Witten]], and [[Maxim Kontsevich|Kontsevich]] have all won [[Fields Medal]]s for work related to topological field theory.

The topological classification of [[Calabi-Yau manifold]]s has important implications in [[string theory]], as different manifolds can sustain different kinds of strings.&lt;ref&gt;Yau, S. &amp; Nadis, S.; ''The Shape of Inner Space'', Basic Books, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cosmology, topology can be used to describe the overall shape of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shape of Space: How to Visualize Surfaces and Three-dimensional Manifolds'' 2nd ed (Marcel Dekker, 1985, {{isbn|0-8247-7437-X}})&lt;/ref&gt; This area of research is commonly known as [[spacetime topology]].

===Geography and Landscape Ecology===
Topological methods have been used to evaluate the complexity of geomorphological and ecological functions in a landscape and can be applied on geographic maps, or field observations (Papadimitriou, 2013), or even on models and programs representing such functions and their changes in time (Papadimitriou, 2012). 

===Robotics===
The possible positions of a [[robot]] can be described by a [[manifold]] called [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]].&lt;ref&gt;John J. Craig, ''Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control'', 3rd Ed. Prentice-Hall, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of [[motion planning]], one finds paths between two points in configuration space. These paths represent a motion of the robot's [[Joint|joints]] and other parts into the desired pose.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Farber, ''Invitation to Topological Robotics'', European Mathematical Society, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games and puzzles===
[[Disentanglement puzzle|Tanglement puzzles]] are based on topological aspects of the puzzle's shapes and components.&lt;ref&gt;[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/644676/how-to-reason-about-disentanglement-tavern-puzzles https://math.stackexchange.com] How to reason about disentanglement puzzles.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=27642974 |doi=10.2307/27642974 |title= Disentangling Topological Puzzles by Using Knot Theory |first=Mathew |last=Horak |journal=Mathematics Magazine |year=2006 |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=368–375}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sma.epfl.ch/~ojangure/Notes.pdf http://sma.epfl.ch/Notes.pdf] A Topological Puzzle, Inta Bertuccioni, December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.futilitycloset.com/2012/06/23/the-figure-8-puzzle/ https://www.futilitycloset.com/the-figure-8-puzzle] The Figure Eight Puzzle, Science and Math, June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiber Art===
In order to create a continuous join of pieces in a modular construction, it is necessary to create an unbroken path in an order which surrounds each piece and traverses each edge only once. This process is an application of the [[Eulerian path]].&lt;ref&gt;Eckman, Edie: ''Connect the shapes crochet motifs: creative techniques for joining motifs of all shapes.'' ©2012 Storey Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25272">In [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[computer science]], '''type theory''' is a branch of [[computational logic]] that studies types, which informally, are attributes that objects can possess. In type theory, each object is a "term" of a definite type and operations on objects are restricted to those which are definitely terms of the relevant types. As a [[formal system]], some type theories contend to be simultaneously an alternative [[Foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]] to [[set theory]], a [[programming language]] and a calculus for [[category theory]]&lt;ref&gt;https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/type+theory&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Type theory is closely related to (and in some cases overlaps with) [[type system]]s, which are a [[programming language]] feature used to reduce [[bug (computer programming)|bug]]s. Type theory was created to avoid paradoxes in a variety of formal [[mathematical logic|logic]]s and [[rewrite system]]s.

Two well-known type theories that can serve as mathematical foundations are [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[typed lambda calculus|typed λ-calculus]] and [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s [[intuitionistic type theory]].

==History==
{{Main|History of type theory}}
Between 1902 and 1908 [[Bertrand Russell]] proposed various "theories of type" in response to his discovery that [[Gottlob Frege]]'s version of [[naive set theory]] was afflicted with [[Russell's paradox]]. By 1908 Russell arrived at a "ramified" theory of types together with an "[[axiom of reducibility]]" both of which featured prominently in [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' published between 1910 and 1913. They attempted to resolve Russell's paradox by first creating a hierarchy of types, then assigning each concrete mathematical (and possibly other) entity to a type. Entities of a given type are built exclusively from entities of those types that are lower in their hierarchy, thus preventing an entity from being assigned to itself. In the 1920s, [[Leon Chwistek]] and [[Frank P. Ramsey]] proposed an unramified type theory, now known as the "theory of simple types" or "simple type theory", that collapsed the hierarchy of the types in the earlier ramified theory and as such did not require the axiom of reducibility.

The common usage of "type theory" is when those types are used with a [[term rewrite system]]. The most famous early example is [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[simply typed lambda calculus]]. Church's theory of types&lt;ref name="church"&gt;[[Alonzo Church]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2266170 ''A formulation of the simple theory of types''], The Journal of Symbolic Logic 5(2):56&amp;ndash;68 (1940)&lt;/ref&gt; helped the formal system avoid the [[Kleene–Rosser paradox]] that afflicted the original untyped lambda calculus. Church demonstrated that it could serve as a foundation of mathematics and it was referred to as a [[higher-order logic]].

Some other type theories include [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s [[intuitionistic type theory]], which has been the foundation used in some areas of [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]] and for the proof assistant [[Agda (programming language)|Agda]]. [[Thierry Coquand]]'s [[calculus of constructions]] and its derivatives are the foundation used by [[Coq]] and others. The field is an area of active research, as demonstrated by [[homotopy type theory]].

==Basic concepts==
In a system of type theory, each '''[[term (logic)|term]]''' has a '''type'''.  For example, &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2+2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;2\cdot 2&lt;/math&gt; are all separate terms with the type &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt; for natural numbers.  Traditionally, the term is followed by a colon and its type, such as &lt;math&gt;2 : \mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;.

Type theories have explicit computation and it is encoded in rules for rewriting terms. These are called '''conversion rules''' or, if the rule only works in one direction, a '''reduction rule'''. For example, &lt;math&gt;2 + 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; are syntactically different terms, but the former reduces to the latter. This reduction is written &lt;math&gt;2 + 2 \twoheadrightarrow 4&lt;/math&gt;.

Functions in type theory have a special reduction rule: the argument of the function call gets substituted for every occurrence of the parameter in the function definition.  Let's say the function &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\lambda x . x+x &lt;/math&gt; (using Church's lambda notation) or &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x+x &lt;/math&gt; (using a more modern notation).  Then, the function call &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double}\ 2&lt;/math&gt; would be reduced by substituting &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; for every copy of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the body of the function definition.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double}\ 2 \twoheadrightarrow 2+2&lt;/math&gt;.

The type of a function is denoted with an arrow &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; from the parameter type to the function's resulting type. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double} : \mathrm{nat} \to \mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;.   Calling or "[[apply]]ing" a function to an argument may be written with or without parentheses, so &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double}(2)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double}\ 2&lt;/math&gt;. Not using parentheses is more common, because multiple argument functions can be defined using [[currying]].

==Difference from set theory==
There are many different set theories and many different systems of type theory, so what follows are generalizations.
* Set theory is built on top of logic. It requires a separate system like [[predicate logic]] underneath it. In type theory, concepts like "and" and "or" can be encoded as types in the type theory itself.
* In set theory, an element can belong to multiple sets, either to a subset or to a superset. In type theory, terms (generally) belong to only one type. (Where a subset would be used, type theory tends to use a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate function]] that returns true if the term is in the subset and returns false if the value is not.  The union of two types can be done by creating a new type called a [[Tagged union|sum type]], which contains new terms.)
* Set theory usually encodes numbers as sets.  (0 is the empty set, 1 is a set containing the empty set, etc.  See [[Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers]].) Type theory can encode numbers as functions using [[Church encoding]] or more naturally as [[Intuitionistic type theory#Inductive types|inductive types]].  Inductive types create new constants for the [[Successor function|successor function]] and zero, and closely resembles [[Peano axioms|Peano's axioms]].
* Set theory allows [[Set-builder notation|set builder notation]].
* Type theory has a simple connection to constructive mathematics through the [[BHK interpretation]].  It can be connected to logic by the [[Curry Howard isomorphism]].  And some type theories are closely connected to [[Category theory]].

==Optional features==
===Normalization===
The term &lt;math&gt;2 + 1&lt;/math&gt; reduces to &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; cannot be reduced further, it is called a '''normal form'''. A system of type theory is said to be '''[[Normalization property (abstract rewriting)|strongly normalizing]]''' if all terms have a normal form and any order of reductions reaches it. '''Weakly normalizing''' systems have a normal form but some orders of reductions may loop forever and never reach it.

For a normalizing system, some borrow the word '''element''' from set theory and use it to refer to all closed terms that can reduce to the same normal form. A '''closed term''' is one without parameters. (A term like &lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt; with its parameter &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called an '''open term'''.) Thus, &lt;math&gt;2 + 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3 + 0&lt;/math&gt; may be different terms but they are both from the element &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;.

A similar idea that works for open and closed terms is convertibility. Two terms are '''convertible''' if there exists a term that they both reduce to. For example, &lt;math&gt;2 + 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1 + 2&lt;/math&gt; are convertible. As are &lt;math&gt;x + (1 + 1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x + 2&lt;/math&gt;. However, &lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1 + x&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a free variable) are not because both are in normal form and they are not the same. [[Confluence (abstract rewriting)|Confluent]] and weakly normalizing systems can test if two terms are convertible by checking if they both reduce to the same normal form.

===Dependent types===
{{Main|Dependent types}}
A '''dependent type''' is a type that depends on a term or on another type. Thus, the type returned by a function may depend upon the argument to the function.

For example, a list of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;s of length 4 may be a different type than a list of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;s of length 5. In a type theory with dependent types, it is possible to define a function that takes a parameter "n" and returns a list containing "n" zeros. Calling the function with 4 would produce a term with a different type than if the function was called with 5.

Dependent types play a central role in [[intuitionistic type theory]] and in the design of [[functional programming languages]] like [[Idris (programming language)|Idris]], [[ATS (programming language)|ATS]], [[Agda (theorem prover)|Agda]] and [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]].

{{anchor|Equality types}}

===Equality types===

Many systems of type theory have a type that represents equality of types and of terms. This type is different from convertibility, and is often denoted '''propositional equality'''.

In intuitionistic type theory, the equality type (also called the identity type) is known as &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; for identity. There is a type &lt;math&gt;I\ A\ a\ b&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a type and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are both terms of type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. A term of type &lt;math&gt;I\ A\ a\ b&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as meaning that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

In practice, it is possible to build a type &lt;math&gt;I\ \mathrm{nat}\ 3\ 4&lt;/math&gt; but there will not exist a term of that type. In intuitionistic type theory, new terms of equality start with reflexivity. If &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; is a term of type &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a term of type &lt;math&gt;I\ \mathrm{nat}\ 3\ 3&lt;/math&gt;. More complicated equalities can be created by creating a reflexive term and then doing a reduction on one side. So if &lt;math&gt;2+1&lt;/math&gt; is a term of type &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a term of type &lt;math&gt;I\ \mathrm{nat}\ (2+1)\ (2+1)&lt;/math&gt; and, by reduction, generate a term of type &lt;math&gt;I\ \mathrm{nat}\ (2+1)\ 3&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, in this system, the equality type denotes that two values of the same type are convertible by reductions.

Having a type for equality is important because it can be manipulated inside the system. There is usually no judgement to say two terms are ''not'' equal; instead, as in the [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]], we map &lt;math&gt;\neg(a = b)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(a = b) \to \bot&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; is the [[bottom type]] having no values. There exists a term with type {{nobreak|&lt;math&gt;(I\ \mathrm{nat}\ 3\ 4) \to \bot&lt;/math&gt;,}} but not one of type &lt;math&gt;(I\ \mathrm{nat}\ 3\ 3) \to \bot&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Homotopy type theory]] differs from [[intuitionistic type theory]] mostly by its handling of the equality type.

===Inductive types===
{{main|Inductive type}}
A system of type theory requires some basic terms and types to operate on. Some systems build them out of functions using [[Church encoding]]. Other systems have '''inductive types''': a set of base types and a set of [[type constructor]]s that generate types with well-behaved properties. For example, [[Structural induction|certain recursive functions]] called on inductive types are guaranteed to terminate.

'''Coinductive type''' are infinite data types created by giving a function that generates the next element(s). See [[Coinduction]] and [[Corecursion]].

'''[[Induction-induction]] ''' is a feature for declaring an inductive type and a family of types that depends on the inductive type.

'''[[Induction-recursion (type theory)|Induction recursion]]''' allows a wider range of well-behaved types, allowing the type and recursive functions operating on it to be defined at the same time.

===Universe types===
Types were created to prevent paradoxes, such as [[Russell's paradox]]. However, the motives that lead to those paradoxes—being able to say things about all types—still exist. So, many type theories have a "universe type", which contains all ''other'' types (and not itself).

In systems where you might want to say something about universe types, there is a hierarchy of universe types, each containing the one below it in the hierarchy. The hierarchy is defined as being infinite, but statements must only refer to a finite number of universe levels.

Type universes are particularly tricky in type theory. The initial proposal of intuitionistic type theory suffered from [[Girard's paradox]].

===Computational component===
Many systems of type theory, such as the [[simply-typed lambda calculus]], [[intuitionistic type theory]], and the [[calculus of constructions]], are also programming languages. That is, they are said to have a "computational component". The computation is the reduction of terms of the language using [[rewriting|rewriting rules]].

A system of type theory that has a well-behaved computational component also has a simple connection to constructive mathematics through the [[BHK interpretation]].

Non-constructive mathematics in these systems is possible by adding operators on continuations such as [[Call/cc#Relation to non-constructive logic|call with current continuation]]. However, these operators tend to break desirable properties such as [[canonicity (type theory)|canonicity]] and [[parametricity]].

==Type theories==
===Major===
* [[Simply typed lambda calculus]] which is a [[higher-order logic]];
* [[intuitionistic type theory]];
* [[system F]];
* [[Logical framework|LF]] is often used to define other type theories;
* [[calculus of constructions]] and its derivatives.

===Minor===
* [[Automath]];
* [[ST type theory]];
* some forms of [[combinatory logic]];
* others defined in the [[lambda cube]];
* others under the name [[typed lambda calculus]];
* others under the name [[pure type system]].

===Active===
* [[Homotopy type theory]] is being researched.

==Practical impact==
===Programming languages===
{{Main|Type system}}
There is extensive overlap and interaction between the fields of type theory and type systems. Type systems are a programming language feature designed to identify bugs. Any static program analysis, such as the type checking algorithms in the semantic analysis phase of [[compiler]], has a connection to type theory.

A prime example is [[Agda (programming language)|Agda]], a programming language which uses [[intuitionistic type theory]] for its type system. The programming language [[ML (programming language)|ML]] was developed for manipulating type theories (see [[Logic for Computable Functions|LCF]]) and its own type system was heavily influenced by them.

===Mathematical foundations===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
The first computer proof assistant, called [[Automath]], used type theory to encode mathematics on a computer. Martin-Löf specifically developed [[intuitionistic type theory]] to encode ''all'' mathematics to serve as a new foundation for mathematics. There is current research into mathematical foundations using [[homotopy type theory]].

Mathematicians working in [[category theory]] already had difficulty working with the widely accepted foundation of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]]. This led to proposals such as Lawvere's [[Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets]] (ETCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=ETCS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homotopy type theory continues in this line using type theory. Researchers are exploring connections between dependent types (especially the identity type) and [[algebraic topology]] (specifically [[homotopy]]).

===Proof assistants===
{{main|Proof assistant}}
Much of the current research into type theory is driven by [[Automated proof checking|proof checkers]], interactive [[proof assistant]]s, and [[Automated theorem proving|automated theorem provers]]. Most of these systems use a type theory as the mathematical foundation for encoding proofs, which is not surprising, given the close connection between type theory and programming languages:
* [[Logical framework|LF]] is used by [[Twelf]], often to define other type theories;
* multiple type theories falling under [[higher-order logic]] are used by the [[HOL (proof assistant)|HOL family of provers]] and [[Prototype Verification System|PVS]];
* [[intuitionistic type theory]] is used by [[Agda (programming language)|Agda]] which is both a programming language and proof assistant;
* computational type theory is used by [[NuPRL]];
* [[calculus of constructions]] and its derivatives are used by [[Coq]] and [[Matita]].

Multiple type theories are supported by [[LEGO (proof assistant)|LEGO]] and [[Isabelle (proof assistant)|Isabelle]]. Isabelle also supports foundations besides type theories, such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]]. [[Mizar system|Mizar]] is an example of a proof system that only supports set theory.

===Linguistics===
Type theory is also widely in use in [[formal semantics (linguistics)|formal theories of semantics]] of [[natural language]]s, especially [[Montague grammar]] and its descendants. In particular, [[categorial grammar]]s and [[pregroup grammar]]s make extensive use of type constructors to define the types (''noun'', ''verb'', etc.) of words.

The most common construction takes the basic types &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; for individuals and [[truth-value]]s, respectively, and defines the set of types recursively as follows:
* if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are types, then so is &lt;math&gt;\langle a,b\rangle&lt;/math&gt;;
* nothing except the basic types, and what can be constructed from them by means of the previous clause are types.

A complex type &lt;math&gt;\langle a,b\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the type of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] from entities of type &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to entities of type &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. Thus one has types like &lt;math&gt;\langle e,t\rangle&lt;/math&gt; which are interpreted as elements of the set of functions from entities to truth-values, i.e. [[indicator function]]s of sets of entities. An expression of type &lt;math&gt;\langle\langle e,t\rangle,t\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a function from sets of entities to truth-values, i.e. a (indicator function of a) set of sets. This latter type is standardly taken to be the type of [[Generalized quantifier|natural language quantifiers]], like '' everybody'' or '' nobody'' ([[Richard Montague|Montague]] 1973, [[Jon Barwise|Barwise]] and Cooper 1981).

===Social sciences===
[[Gregory Bateson]] introduced a theory of logical types into the social sciences; his notions of [[double bind]] and [[logical levels]] are based on Russell's theory of types.

==Relation to category theory==
Although the initial motivation for [[category theory]] was far removed from foundationalism, the two fields turned out to have deep connections. As [[John Lane Bell]] writes: "In fact categories can ''themselves'' be viewed as type theories of a certain kind; this fact alone indicates that type theory is much more closely related to category theory than it is to set theory." In brief, a category can be viewed as a type theory by regarding its objects as types (or sorts), i.e. "Roughly speaking, a category may be thought of as a type theory shorn of its syntax." A number of significant results follow in this way:&lt;ref name="Sets and Extensions in the Twentieth Century"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of the History of Logic. Volume 6. Sets and Extensions in the Twentieth Century|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-093066-4| author=John L. Bell|chapter=Types, Sets and Categories | url = http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/types.pdf |editor=Akihiro Kanamory}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cartesian closed category|cartesian closed categories]] correspond to the typed λ-calculus ([[Lambek]], 1970);
* [[C-monoid]]s (categories with products and exponentials and a single, nonterminal object) correspond to the untyped λ-calculus (observed independently by Lambek and [[Dana Scott]] around 1980);
* [[Locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed categories]] correspond to [[Martin-Löf type theory|Martin-Löf type theories]] (Seely, 1984).

The interplay, known as [[categorical logic]], has been a subject of active research since then; see the monograph of Jacobs (1999) for instance.
