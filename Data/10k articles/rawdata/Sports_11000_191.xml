      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4081">'''Albuquerque Civic Auditorium''' was an indoor arena in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].  It opened in 1957, and was demolished in 1987. It was notable for its innovative construction, as the dome was created by pouring concrete over a mound of packed earth that was subsequently removed. The auditorium was located east of [[Downtown Albuquerque|Downtown]] on Grand Avenue (now Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Ave.), between St. Joseph Hospital and [[Interstate 25 in New Mexico|Interstate 25]]. It opened in 1957 and had a capacity of 6,000 people.

==History==
The Albuquerque Civic Auditorium was designed by the Albuquerque firm of Ferguson, Stevens and Associates in 1955.  Architects Gordon Ferguson and Donald Stevens came up with the idea of using an earthen mound as a form for the poured-in-place concrete dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Civic Auditorium Designs Follow Modernist Trend| newspaper=Albuquerque Journal | date=April 22, 1955| location=NM | page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An existing hill on the site was built up and shaped to the proper dimensions, followed by a ten-day concrete pour. The earth was then excavated from under the dome to create the arena space. The finished dome was {{convert|62|ft|m}} high, {{convert|218|ft|m}} in diameter, and varied in thickness from {{convert|5|in|cm}} at the center to {{convert|2|ft|cm}} at the edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Mound-Made Auditorium | journal=Life | date=June 10, 1957 | volume=42 | issue=23 | page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The innovative construction technique garnered a mention in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' and was also praised by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] during a lecture at the [[University of New Mexico]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Mahoney | first=Jane | title=The First 60 Years | newspaper=Albuquerque Journal | date=November 29, 2004 | location=NM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue opened on April 27, 1957, with a performance by the [[Albuquerque Civic Symphony]].&lt;ref name=Info&gt;[http://www.ledzeppelin-database.com/geekbaseweb/forumpage.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=34 Venue information and background]&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years the venue hosted a number of notable acts, including [[Led Zeppelin]] in 1969 and [[Jimi Hendrix]] in 1970, just three months before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Herrera | first=Dan | title=Musician recorded '60s music scene | newspaper=Albuquerque Journal | date=January 1, 1999 | location=NM | page=E13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the home venue of the [[University of Albuquerque|University of Albuquerque Dons]] basketball team from 1963 to 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=St. Joseph's to Buy Portable Gym Floor for Use in Auditorium | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18263225/albuquerque_journal/ | accessdate=March 13, 2018 | work=Albuquerque Journal | date=November 16, 1963 | via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the auditorium had poor acoustics and eventually fell from popularity as a music venue in favor of [[Tingley Coliseum]] and Popejoy Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer |first=Mo |title=Albuquerque's Civic Auditorium went from a landmark to the dustbin of history |url=http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2008/feb/14/mo-palmer-albuquerques-civic-auditorium-went-landm/ |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |newspaper=Albuquerque Tribune |date=February 14, 2008 |location=NM |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112131214/http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2008/feb/14/mo-palmer-albuquerques-civic-auditorium-went-landm/ |archivedate=November 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was demolished in 1987.

The '''Beeghly Physical Education Center''', or simply '''Beeghly Center''', is a 6,300-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Youngstown, Ohio]]. The arena, built at a cost of $5.5 million and named for local businessman [[Leon A. Beeghly]], opened on December 2, 1972. It is home to the [[Youngstown State University]] Penguins [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] [[team]]s.  The first event at the arena was a basketball game against the [[Ohio University]] Bobcats, which ended in a 68-59 Youngstown State victory.

The arena, which originally seated 6,000, has undergone many changes since its opening.  The Youngstown State women's basketball team moved into the arena in the mid-1970s.  In 1983, permanent seats at both ends of the court and 1,260 chairback  seats at mid-court were added.  On September 15, 1996, YSU dedicated Veterans' Plaza directly in front of Beeghly Center. This $500,000 community project was funded in-part through private donations to honor all United States Veterans.  In 2000,  the court was repainted, two additional scoreboards were added and expanded press-row seating was created.  In May 2002, the facility underwent more than $2.5 million in additional renovations, including a new front and rear lobby, new hallways and locker rooms and a new $150,000 sound system.

The multipurpose facility includes an Olympic-sized swimming and diving facility, racquetball and squash courts, classrooms, and administrative offices. Beeghly is also home to the men's and women's basketball offices as well as the Olympic sports offices.

In addition to YSU intercollegiate basketball and volleyball contests, as well as university events, Beeghly Center has served as the site for high school competitions, [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] matches (though the WWE now uses the newer [[Covelli Centre]] nearby when visiting Youngstown), concerts, tradeshows, and numerous other functions that dot the busy facility schedule throughout the year. The venue also hosted a [[Barack Obama]] rally in February 2008.

The Beeghly Center holds many YSU classes throughout each semester, as well as the Youngstown City School District's "All-City" Science Fair competition. The facility is used for [[graduation]] ceremonies at the end of every semester.

The facility should not be confused with the nearby—and newer—[[Beeghly Hall]], where YSU's Beeghly College of Education is housed, and also holds YSU classes.

'''Canada''' has participated in every '''[[Commonwealth Games]]''' since the [[1930 British Empire Games|first ever British Empire Games]] held in [[Hamilton, Ontario]] in 1930, one of only six countries to have done so. The others are [[Australia at the Commonwealth Games|Australia]], [[England at the Commonwealth Games|England]], [[New Zealand at the Commonwealth Games|New Zealand]], [[Scotland at the Commonwealth Games|Scotland]], and [[Wales at the Commonwealth Games|Wales]].

== History ==
'''[[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]''' competed separately at the [[1930 British Empire Games|1930]] and [[1934 British Empire Games|1934]] Games (although not winning any medals), but since [[1950 British Empire Games|1950]] has competed as part of Canada.

The Canadian team won 54 medals in the [[1930 British Empire Games|first (1930) Games]], and 51 gold medals at [[1986 Commonwealth Games|Edinburgh (1986)]]. Canada's biggest total medal tally was 129 medals in [[1994 Commonwealth Games|Victoria (1994)]].

Canada came third in the medal count at the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]] after Australia and England, and is third on the [[all-time medal tally of Commonwealth Games]], with an overall total of 1318 medals (413 Gold, 443 Silver and 462 Bronze). Canada was top of the medal tally once, at the [[1978 Commonwealth Games|1978 games]] at [[Edmonton, Alberta]]

Canada has hosted the games four times. The first Games were at [[Hamilton, Ontario]] in 1930. [[Vancouver]] hosted the [[1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] notable for the famous "miracle mile" ([[four-minute mile]]) between [[Roger Bannister]] of [[England]] and [[John Landy]] of Australia at [[Empire Stadium, Vancouver|Empire Stadium]]. [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] was the first city to host the [[1978 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games under that name in 1978]], and [[Victoria, British Columbia]] hosted the [[1994 Commonwealth Games|Games in 1994]].

Hamilton applied to host the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] but lost to the [[Delhi]] bid. [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] withdrew its [[Halifax 2014 Commonwealth Games bid|bid]] for the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]].

The Commonwealth Games Association in Canada, known as [[Commonwealth Games Canada]] (CGC) is responsible for organizing the Canadian team participating in the Commonwealth Games.

'''Crocker''' (sometimes spelled ''Croccer'') is a [[team sport]] played between two large teams. Its origins are in [[cricket]] and [[baseball]]. It also makes the use of a [[rugby ball]] which may explain its name. It is a casual sport not played formally, but often found on British [[summer camps]].

==Rules==
===Teams===
Crocker is played between two [[team sport|teams]] of undefined size, typically between 10 and 50 per side. The teams are not necessarily exactly even, though they are usually of similar size. Alternatively, a lack of skill on the side of one team may be made up for by a numerical advantage (for example in the case of many children playing against fewer adults).

===The Field and Players===
Crocker fields vary, but will often take advantage of whatever space is available. Often taking place on large, flat, grassy school fields, a crocker pitch may not have defined outer limits.

A generally agreed setup will involve a semicircular bowling and batting area usually marked out with cones. The batsman stands in the middle of the flat edge of the semicircle while the bowler stands opposite him on the curved edge. A ''wicket'' is set up behind the batsman, as in cricket, usually made of four cricket [[stumps]] set up to make a wider version of real cricket stumps or in another variation of the game a chair may be used as the wicket.

====Fielding Team====
Behind the stumps stands a fielding player, or sometimes two; this position is usually called the wicket-keeper. At either corner of the semicircle are two more stumps set up, between which the batsmen may run.

The rest of the fielding team stand anywhere in front of the batsman and outside the semicircle. The fielding team are not allowed inside the semicircle while the ball is being bowled, and at any time typically only six players are allowed on the edge of the semicircle. The rest of the fielding team tends to spread out to field and catch shots played by the batsman.

====Batting Team====
In the general case, apart from the batsman, none of the batting team is allowed on the field of play. Instead, they line up several meteres behind the batsman to watch and prepare to bat. However some variations on the rules make use of the 'disrupting rule', whereby 5 members of the batting team are allowed to enter the field of play and disrupt the fielders as they try to recover the ball. The ''disrupters'' have to follow three clear rules. First, they must not touch the ball with their hands (unless they are inside the bowling/batting area and are permitted to use their hands to remove the ball from the semicircle.) Secondly there must be no physical contact between a disrupter and any member of the fielding team. And thirdly the disrupters may not interfere with the ball when it is on its way back to the bowler.

====Umpire====
If an [[umpire]] is present, they will usually stand at one of the corners. Their role is to count the runs and to uphold the rules and make decisions during the game.

===Equipment===
Any equipment is often made up of things that are to hand, but usually they consist of a [[Association football ball|football]]-sized ball, though a softer ball may often be used to prevent injury (for example, a [[volleyball (ball)|volleyball]]). Sometimes even a [[Rugby football|rugby]] ball is used.

The batsman's bat is usually a [[baseball bat]], or a [[rounders]] bat, although cricket bats have been known to be used.

===Play===
During play, the bowler will bowl the ball, trying to hit the stumps. Unlike cricket, the bowler can bowl continuously, as soon as he or she receives the ball, whether the batsman is in position or not.  The following rules apply to a ball bowled by the bowler at the batsman:

*The ball must bounce in front of the batsman before he hits it.
**If the ball does not bounce, and the batsman hits it, it is declared a "Full toss" by the umpire and the batsman cannot be out.
**If the ball does not bounce, and the batsman fails to hit it, and the ball hits the stumps, the batsman is not out.
**If the ball does not bounce, and the batsman fails to hit it, and the ball does not hit the stumps, no special call is made.
*If the ball strikes the batsman on the leg or other part of body on the way to the stumps, without first hitting the bat, a "Leg Before Wicket" ('''LBW''') call is made by the umpire and the batsman is declared to be "half out". Unlike in cricket, the [[Leg before wicket|LBW]] call often does not depend on whether the ball would have hit the stumps if it had not been hit.
*If the batsman hits the ball, he or she must '''run'''. A run counts if the batsman taps one of the stumps with his bat and runs back to his batting position. Some rule sets stipulate that the batsman must run around the stump. By convention, but not usually by rule, the batsman alternates between runs to the left and right.
*The batsman plays until he or she is '''out''' (see below).

The bowler and the six fielders on the edge of the semicircle are rotated at regular intervals (10 to 30 balls bowled).

===Methods of Dismissal===
A batsman can be dismissed in a variety of ways. The usual rules of crocker include the following:

*The batsman may be '''bowled''' if the "bail" is knocked off the [[Wicket|stumps]], either by the ball or by the batsman.
*The batsman may be '''caught''' if he or she hits the ball and, without touching the ground, it is caught by a fielding player.
*The batsman may be '''out Leg Before Wicket''' if he is given '''half-out''' for LBW twice.

There are also often various other methods of dismissal for crocker batsman, especially relating to [[sportsmanship]]. Loosely connected to this is being '''retired''', which is to be taken from batting, usually either on reaching a certain score or batting for a certain time.

Crocker is unique in the rotation between batsmen. As soon as one is out, the bowler may immediately bowl another ball, if he or she has the ball, even if the next batsman is not ready and in position, then he or she is given out if out in any of the above ways. This is most likely to do with the length of the game; with the potential for over 100 batsmen in a match the emphasis is on speed and participation of everyone.

===Winning the Game===
Crocker is won by the team who, at the end of the match, has more runs. The runs are counted by the umpire.

==Special rules==
Special rules of crocker are often employed. The most common of these are:

*A batsman may not be out on their first time attending the camp or other event at which crocker is played.
*A batsman may not be out to a ball that is bowled too fast. This is often a point of controversy, but the decision usually rests with the umpire and is to make the game more playable.
*A batsman may bat on behalf of his or her spouse, if the spouse is not available.
*A batsman may not take a large step towards the bowled ball, so as to cause a full toss artificially.
*If the batsman hits the ball behind the wickets only one run may be obtained, this rule stops people batting towards buildings etc.

==Tactics==
There is not much scope for tactics in crocker, but there are some that can be employed more by individuals than as a team.

*The large number of fielders means that they will often get in one another's way. Also, they will often tend to clump together to talk as the ball may not come to them for a while. Therefore, some individuals who have greater fielding skills may disperse themselves throughout the field.
*A favoured batting tactic is for the batsman to tap the ball. Since the fielders are not allowed in the semicircle while the ball is being bowled, they have to run in every time that happens, and this gives time for the batsman to make a run. However, the ball usually returns to the bowler quickly, and therefore the batsman will find himself or herself having to continually run, and will often be tired out quickly.
*Some fielding placement is possible. The wicketkeeper should position himself or herself carefully, while a fielder [[Fielding (cricket)|square]] on either side of the batsman will receive more than average balls their way.
*A typical batsman's shot will be one that goes straight into the ground, so as to prevent a catch, but so that it bounces and has to be fielded in the outfield.

'''Alternatively'''

If caught out a player is only half out.
If a player performs a "double hit" then they are one third out
If the amount to which a player is out is greater than 1 then they are fully out.
A player is still fully out straight away if they are bowled out (except on their first hit).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14163">The '''ECHL Hall of Fame''' is an ice hockey museum dedicated to honoring members that have played in the [[ECHL]] (formerly known as the East Coast Hockey League). It was created by the league in 2008. The ECHL Board of Governors created the ECHL [[Hall of Fame]] to recognize the achievements of players, coaches, and personnel who dedicated their careers to the league.  Hall of Fame members are selected in four categories: Player, Developmental Player, Builder, and Referee/Linesman. Players must have concluded their career as an active player for a minimum of three playing seasons, though not continuous or full seasons. Developmental Players must have begun their career in the ECHL and went on to a distinguished career in the NHL, playing a minimum of 260 regular season games in the NHL, AHL and ECHL. Builders may be active or inactive whereas Referee/Linesman must have concluded their active officiating career for a minimum of three playing seasons.

No more than five candidates are elected to the Hall of Fame each year with no more than three Players, one Developmental Player, two Builders and one Referee/Linesman. The Builder and the Referee/Linesman categories are dependent upon the number of candidates in the Player category.

The nomination and subsequent selection of candidates is determined by the ECHL Hall of Fame Selection Committee which is appointed by the ECHL.

The ECHL Hall of Fame inaugural class was inducted during the 2008 [[ECHL All-Star Game]] festivities at [[Stockton Arena]] in [[Stockton, California]], and included ECHL founder [[Henry Brabham]], the ECHL's first commissioner [[Patrick J. Kelly]], and former players [[Nick Vitucci]] and [[Chris Valicevic]].

'''Eastern Washington Fieldhouse''' was a 5,000 seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Cheney, Washington]].   It was home to the [[Eastern Washington University|Eastern Washington State College]] (EWSC) Eagles [[basketball]] team until the [[Reese Court]] opened in 1975.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{harvnb|ESPN|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The facility was destroyed by fire on April 25, 1977.&lt;ref&gt;http://econtent.library.ewu.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/ewucampus&amp;CISOPTR=10&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building history==
The fieldhouse was moved to EWSC in 1947 and opened in 1948. The building had been located 70 miles away at [[Farragut Naval Training Station]] in Bayview, Idaho, where it had been used for drill. At EWSC the 800 foot long building was home to a gymnasium and swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;April 28, 1977 Cheney Free Press, Cheney Washington, Vol. 80, No. 49, Pg 1 &amp; 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demolition==
In the fall of 1976 the building was condemned for life safety code violations.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney Free Press, Cheney Washington, April 28, 1977, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;   
EWSC contracted with George Kelp Building Wrecking Company of Spokane for the building's demolition. Old bolts in the buildings roof construction could not be removed without cutting them out, and therefore a welder's torch was used.&lt;ref&gt;April 25, 1977, Cheney Free Press, researched and compiled by,Susan L. Ferguson in 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==The fire==
At 11:10am, the Cheney fire department got the call that the Fieldhouse was on fire. Twice before, small fires had been accidentally started by the demolition team. But this fire was different. The fire was started when a spark from a welder's torch found fuel in a pile of the building's dismantled material. With more than half the roof already removed, a "wind tunnel" effect was created as the fire pulled in the oxygen it needed to quickly grow. By 11:12am, the fire Chief was on the scene and sounded a mutual aid alarm. More than 30 firefighters from around the district responded. Within 10 minutes, the entire Fieldhouse was engulfed in flames. The blaze was so hot that reportedly cars parked almost 100 feet away were "scorched." A Cheney fire truck was even damaged by the heat. The firefighters, realizing the building was a complete loss, focused on containment and protecting the surrounding buildings. The fire wasn't under control until 2:00pm. But winds in the area required crews to remain on scene an additional 12 hours.&lt;ref&gt;April 25, 1977, Cheney Free Press, researched and compiled by,Susan L. Ferguson in 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==The aftermath of the fire==
The Cheney Fire Department Chief Tony Singleton estimated that fire damage to the departments equipment exceeded $6,000. Total damage figures for the ROTC building came out at over $250,00 according to Singleton. The ROTC building's roof was so badly damaged that classes had to be held in another building for nearly a year.&lt;ref&gt;The Easterner, EWSC Cheney, Wash. Thursday 28, 1977, Vol. 28, No. 25 page 1&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen firemen were treated for smoke inhalation and one fireman was treated for a cut on his hand.According to Singleton the toll of the fire could have been more serious than it turned out to be. Lt. Gene Bloom almost lost his life due to a falling roof shortly after responding to the fire.&lt;ref&gt;April 28, 1977 Cheney Free Press, Cheney Washington, Vol. 80, No. 49, Pg 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastern Washington State College sought reimbursement for the $70,000,000 worth of damages to the campus facilities.&lt;ref&gt;May 5, 1977 Cheney Free Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estadio Cibao''' is a multi-use stadium in [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]], Dominican Republic.  Currently, it is mostly used for baseball games and hosts the home games of the [[Águilas Cibaeñas]] in the [[Dominican Winter Baseball League]].  The stadium opened on October 25, 1958 and was constructed by the engineer Bienvenido Martinez Brea.&lt;ref name="Bajo Techo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/bajotecho/docs/bajo_techo_2|title=Estadios de Beisball Dominicanos |publisher=Bajo Techo Revista Inmobiliaria|accessdate=2010-07-22|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estadio Cibao seats 18,077 spectators, making it the largest in the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref name="ESPN.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/worldclassic2006/news/story?id=2291226|title=Welcome to the Dominican Republic |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2010-07-22|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its field dimensions are 335 feet at the foul poles, 365 feet at the power alleys and 385 feet at center field.

In 2008, Estadio Cibao exclusively hosted the [[2008 Caribbean Series|Caribbean Series]] for the first time. Yet, this was the second time in the [[Dominican Republic]] that series was played outside [[Estadio Quisqueya]] (the first was in 1976, when the venues were split).

The '''Estadio de Mongomo''' is a multi-sports stadium in [[Mongomo]], Equatorial Guinea.

In November 2014, it was announced the stadium will be a venue for the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EQUATORIAL GUINEA DESIGNATED HOST COUNTRY OF ORANGE AFCON 2015|url=http://www.cafonline.com/en-US/NewsCenter/News/NewsDetails?id=u7ddHnklj3HXL1y51eoh4g%3d%3d|publisher=cafonline.com|accessdate=14 November 2014|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exposition Park''' was the name given to three historic stadiums, located in what is today  [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. The fields were used mainly for professional [[baseball]] and [[American football]] from c. 1879 to c. 1915. The ballparks were initially located on the north side of the [[Allegheny River]] in [[Allegheny City, Pennsylvania]]. The city was annexed into Pittsburgh (then often spelled "Pittsburg") in 1907, which became the city's [[North Side (Pittsburgh)|North Side]], located across from Pittsburgh's downtown area. Due to flooding from the nearby river, the three stadiums' exact locations varied somewhat. The final version of the ballpark was between the eventual sites of [[Three Rivers Stadium]] and [[PNC Park]].

In 1903, the third incarnation of Exposition Park was the first [[National League]] ballpark to host a [[World Series]] game. The Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP)—known today as the [[University of Pittsburgh]]—played home [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|football]] games at Exposition Park, and also used the park as a home field for the [[Pittsburgh Panthers baseball|university's baseball team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittyearbooks&amp;cc=pittyearbooks&amp;idno=1911e49702&amp;node=1911e49702%3A17&amp;frm=frameset&amp;view=image&amp;seq=210 | title=The Owl | year=1911 | page=205 | publisher=University of Pittsburgh | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Exposition Park I and II===
Named for other "expositions" that would be shown there, including [[horse racing]] and [[circus]]es, '''Exposition Park I''' was the first venue in Pittsburgh that hosted baseball.&lt;ref name=Enc485&gt;{{harvnb|Finoli|Ranier|2003|p=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]—then known simply as Allegheny, or informally as "the Alleghenys"—began play at Exposition Park as a member of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]]; however, after one season a fire and flooding of the field from the nearby River forced a second park to be built.&lt;ref name=PPGexp&gt;{{Citation |title= Exposition Park|url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06192/700663-341.stm|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=11 July 2006|accessdate=31 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its reason for construction '''Exposition Park II''' was built closer to the River. The Alleghenys played at the second incarnation of the park until they moved to [[Recreation Park (Pittsburgh)|Recreation Park]] in 1884, which was several blocks north and out of the flood plain.&lt;ref name=Enc485/&gt;

===Exposition Park III===
[[File:Expo Park postcard.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Postcard ca. 1900 including Exposition Park]]
While the Pittsburgh Pirates were playing home games at Recreation Park, owners John Beemer and M. B. Lennon of the [[Pittsburgh Burghers]] constructed a baseball park near the former site of Exposition Park I and II,&lt;ref name=Enc4867&gt;{{harvnb|Finoli|Ranier|2003|pp=486–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was approximately two blocks west of where PNC Park sits today. '''Exposition Park III''' included a roofed wooden grandstand around the infield, and open bleacher sections extending to the right and left field corners. Total capacity was about 10,000&amp;nbsp;spectators. The seats faced the Allegheny River and the [[Point State Park|Point]].&lt;ref name=PPGexp/&gt;[[Image:ExpositionParkin1905.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A view of Exposition Park III in 1905. [[Winter Garden at Exposition Hall|Exposition Hall]] and its rollercoaster can also be seen in the foreground]] The Burghers played at the stadium during the [[Players' League|1890 Players' League season]]— both the team and league's only season in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/PBB/|title= Pittsburgh Burghers History &amp; Encyclopedia|accessdate=31 December 2008 |work= BaseballReference.com|publisher= Sports Reference, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 10, 1890, [[Jocko Fields]] of the Pittsburgh Burghers hit the first home run at Exposition Park III.

The Pittsburgh Pirates moved to Exposition Park the following season. On April 24, 1891, [[Fred Carroll]] hit the first home run by a Pirate in the stadium. Under the management of [[Fred Clarke]] the Pirates won the National League pennant in 1901, 1902, and 1903. After the 1903 season, Dreyfuss and [[Boston Americans]] owner [[Henry Killilea]] organized a best of nine game series to match the two pennant winners against each other. The [[1903 World Series|first World Series]] held three games in Boston before moving to Exposition Park with the Pirates leading the series 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/postseason/mlb_ws_recaps.jsp?feature=1903|title= 1903 World Series|accessdate= 1 January 2009|work= WorldSeries.com|publisher= MLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, 1903, 7,600&amp;nbsp;people attended the first [[World Series]] game in a National League stadium—the Pirates won by one run. The following day 12,000&amp;nbsp;people attended the game, forcing some spectators to stand behind a rope in the outfield.&lt;ref name=PPGexp/&gt; The Pirates lost three of four games at Exposition Park and eventually the Series.

During a July 4, 1902 doubleheader against the [[Brooklyn Superbas]], an Allegheny flood caused water to rise to thigh level in center and right fields, and about head level in deep center. Players occasionally caught a ball and dove under the water. The Pirates won both games of the doubleheader.&lt;ref name=Lowry&gt;{{Citation |title=Green Cathedrals |last=Lowry |first=Philip |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=Walker &amp; Company |location= |isbn=978-0-8027-1608-8 |page=184 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Afo5vtVTz4wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=green%20cathedrals&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ham Hyatt]] is believed to be the only person to hit a ball over the right field fence.&lt;ref name=Enc4867/&gt; Monument Hill, which overlooked the field, allowed spectators a free view of the game
[[File:1901–1903 Pittsburgh Pirates.jpg|left|thumb|The Pirates — 1901–1903]]
In 1906, the Pirates were the first baseball team to cover their field with a tarp during inclement weather, and though the field was kept dry from the rain, the Allegheny River still caused problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/len-berman/top-5-sports-stories_b_565949.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Top 5 Sports Stories | date=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flooding sometimes covered the entire outfield with inches of standing water, causing ground rules that gave any ground ball hit into the outfield an automatic single. In 1907, Pittsburgh's pitcher [[Nick Maddox]] threw a [[no-hitter]] at Exposition Park.[[File:Exposition Park.jpg|thumb|Baseball game, 1904]]

In 1908, owing to the large numbers of people that attended Pirates games, team owner Barney Dreyfuss began looking for a location to construct a new Pirates stadium. The final Pirates game at Exposition Park was played against the Chicago Cubs on June 24, 1909. The Pirates won the game 8–1 in front of 5,545&amp;nbsp;people,&lt;ref name=CP&gt;{{Citation |first= Chris|last= Potter|title= Was there a baseball field that the Pittsburgh Pirates played in before Forbes Field in Oakland?|url= http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A47798|publisher= [[Pittsburgh City Paper]]|date=12 June 2008|accessdate=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[George Gibson (baseball)|George Gibson]] achieving the final National League hit in the ballpark.&lt;ref name=Enc4867/&gt; The very next day, the Pirates once again played the Cubs as the team opened [[Forbes Field]].

The [[Pittsburgh Filipinos]] called Exposition Park their home in 1912. The Filipinos lasted just over a month after folding with the [[United States Baseball League]]. In 1914, the [[Pittsburgh Rebels|Pittsburgh Stogies]] began play at Exposition Park. In 1915, the team, renamed the Pittsburgh Rebels, despite improving from the previous season, disbanded due to financial loss with the entire Federal League. Exposition Park continued to host [[Semi-professional]] baseball games, as well as other events, but "was eventually razed".&lt;ref name=Enc4867/&gt;

===Football===
The Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP), which would in 1908 be renamed the [[University of Pittsburgh]], played its first official game at Exposition Park on October 11, 1890 when Shadyside Academy failed to show up for their game with the [[Allegheny Athletic Association]]. The Allegheny A.A. made a call to WUP team founder [[Bert Smyers]] to bring the WUP team to the park as a replacement.[[File:PittWVUatExpoPark1908.jpg|right|300px|thumb|University of Pittsburgh football game — 1908]] The WUP team was subsequently defeated 38-0.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In addition to players that Mosse brought with him, WUP also recruited players from [[Geneva College]] to play on the team. Mosse's first season was a disappointment as the WUP football team went 0–8–1 and supporters of the team disbanded leaving the team $500 in debt. [[George Hubbard Clapp]] then organized a voluntary $5 "athletic fee" to be paid by students in order to allow the debt to be repaid and the school's football team to play home games at Exposition Park during the next season in order to give the WUP team a more permanent and stable home. Mosse and university officials then obtained a lease to play at Exposition Park during the fall from Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss for 20% of the admission fee. The 1904 WUP team, the first full season in which WUP played at Exposition Park, saw WUP achieve a remarkable turnaround that included a 10–0 record in which they outscored opponents 407 to 5 and finished second in the state behind the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Pitt :the story of the University of Pittsburgh, 1787-1987|last= Alberts|first= Robert C.|year= 1986|publisher= University of Pittsburgh Press|location= Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|isbn= |pages= 64–5|url= http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;q1=Exposition%20Park;rgn=full%20text;idno=00c50130m;didno=00c50130m;view=image;seq=84;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to home games at Exposition Park, WUP students would organize parades through downtown streets prior to marching across a bridge to the game.  A gong, used to announce the beginning of Pirates games, was also sounded prior to the opening kickoff of WUP football contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Today==
After parts of 62 seasons in the Oakland district, baseball and football returned to the north side of the Allegheny River when [[Three Rivers Stadium]] opened. The site of the final incarnation of Exposition Park, relative to Three Rivers and the later PNC Park, was in between the two venues. Exposition Park had been on the southwest corner of South Avenue (later Robinson) to the north (first base) and School Street (later Scotland) to the east (third base). To the south (left field) was some open space and railroad tracks and the Allegheny. To the west (right field) was some open space and then Grant Street (later Galveston). That open space would eventually be the site of Three Rivers. Therefore, the site of Exposition Park was the northeast corner of the parking lot east of Three Rivers.

In 1995, members of the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] placed a plaque where [[Baseball field#Home plate|home plate]] is believed to have been located, in honor of one of the two sites of the first World Series (the other being in Boston). In 1998, a [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission|Pennsylvania Historical marker]] was placed at the site of the park.&lt;ref name=PPGexp/&gt; [[Interstate 279]] currently runs over portions of the site of Exposition Park just before crossing the [[Allegheny River]] along the [[Fort Duquesne Bridge]].

The '''Georg-Gaßmann-Stadion''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in the district of [[Ockershausen]] in [[Marburg]], [[Germany]], named after the former politician and mayor of the city, [[Georg Gaßmann]].

The stadium, opened in 1967, is primarily used by the [[American football]] team [[Marburg Mercenaries]], who play in the [[German Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercenaries.de/cms/verein/ |title=Der Verein |work=Marburg Mercenaries |accessdate=7 March 2010 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301115954/http://www.mercenaries.de/cms/verein/ |archivedate=March 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[VfB Marburg]], the city's highest ranked [[association football]] team, also use the ground for friendlies and cup games against higher-ranked opponents. The [[Thorpe Cup]] [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] meetings in 2009 and 2010 were also held at the stadium.

With its 12,000 [[Seating capacity|capacity]], the Georg-Gaßmann-Stadion is the largest in the region of [[:de:Mittelhessen|Mittelhessen]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9858">'''Hydroflight sports''' are a category of sport in which water jet [[propulsion]] is used to create sustained flight where lift and movement are controlled by a person riding on a propulsion device. It is a fast-paced sport that is growing in popularity at a fine rate of speed. Competitions for this sport started around 2012. There are many training centres throughout the world where beginners to go to learn and practice skills so they can fly these devices by themselves.

== Types of hydroflight equipment ==

There are many different types of Hydroflight products that are used for flying. The three most common types are the Jetboards, Jetpacks and Jetbikes, but there are others such as the [[Hoverboard]] and [[Freedom Flyer]]. Different varieties of jetboards are manufactured by different companies such as Flyboard, Defy X and Wataboard. This gives buyers a choice on which style board will suite their style of use.

Jetboard
The jetboard is a device that has two jets either side of the deck, on top of the deck is where the boots/bindings (generally wakeboarding boots) are bolted in and this is where the pilot will strap themselves into. The direction and control of the jetboard comes down to the amount of propulsion being applied, the angle that your feet are pointing and the distribution of your bodyweight.

Jetpack
The jetpack is a device that is attached to your back with the two jets situated next to your shoulders. You’re held to the device by a five-point safety/[[racing harness]] (same as the ones used in race car seats). You control the direction of flight using the two handles that are attached to the jets on a 45-degree angle, by moving these controls you will change your flight path.

Jetbike
The Jetbike is a device that has a [[motorcycle]] style seat and allows its pilot to fly in a position that replicates a motorcyclist’s form. There is nothing to hold you in but two small straps located on the foot pad. The bike has one main jet underneath the seat and two smaller jets located at the front of the bike which have handles attached to them to control the direction of your flight path.

Freedom flyer
The Freedom Flyer is a great device which can actually be used by those who may suffer from a disability to the lower half of their body. The device is in the shape of a chair which has one main jet under the seat and two jets situated on either side of it which has handles attached to either side so the pilot can alter their flight path.

Hoverboard
The Hoverboard is a snowboard style device which only has one main jet situated underneath it. It is ridden with a side-on stance and it directed by the distribution of the pilots own body-weight.

==Events/Competitions==
*HydroJam &amp; Expo
*Open Competitions:
Hydro Fest 2016 / Session One / FlyCup / Hydroflight World Championship / Louisiana Hydroflight Invitational

*Flyboard competitions:
Flyboard European Championship 2016 / XDubai Flyboard World Cup 2015 / XDubai Hoverboard Race 2015 / North American Flyboard Championship 2015 / XDubai Flyboard World Cup 2014 / Flyboard World Cup 2013 / Flyboard World Cup 2012 / Japan Flyboard World Cup

==Training==
Training: You can find training centres throughout the world where they will teach you how to learn the basic skills required for the sport of hydroflight. These centres usually cost quite a bit of money but that is to cover the cost of fuel, the cost of the instructor’s wage, the cost of hiring equipment (if you don’t already have your own) and sometimes to help cover the cost of the private lake that the company is using. Many training centres also operate straight off the beach or other coastal locations.

In Australia there is only one franchise that offer hydroflight training. The name of this company is Jetpack Adventures. They have training centres in the following cities around Australia; Gold Coast, Sydney, Sunshine Coast, Whitsundays, Central Coast and Perth. These centres are placed at locations such as regatta centres, inland canals and even a giant man made pool. The beach is often a tricky place to try teach beginners because of tides and currents that come into effect. Jetpack adventures is a growing company that performs stunt shows all around Australia at different events such as the V8 Supercars GC 600, Defqon dance festival, Redcliffe Kite Festival and many other events but they have even hosted the Go Pro Athlete Summit.

==Injuries==
Injuries are a major factor when it comes to hydroflight sports especially when the pilot starts to perform advanced movements. Injuries can occur at absolutely any time of your flight. 
•	Hitting the pressurized hose at speed can cause [[concussion]], [[bruising]] and even broken toes / ankles / legs. 
•	Diving into the water presents the danger of breaking your neck, concussion, dislocation of shoulders / back or neck, and if the pilot attempts to scoop the trajectory of the dive underwater against his current rotation he will be at serious risk of a back injury.
•	Hitting the water flat (non-diving position) from a height of 10 meters will bring the pilot to a stop in less than 1 foot which can cause serious bruising to your body and internal organs, it also strains the connective tissue securing the organs and possible minor [[haemorrhaging]] of lungs and other tissue is also possible.
•	According to the website Hyper Physics (impact force of falling object generator), if a fully kitted up pilot with the weight of 75&amp;nbsp;kg fell from a full height of 16 meters (without the help of forward momentum or the force of the jets pushing them) he would hit the water at approximately 63&amp;nbsp;km/h. Yet most professionals weigh between 75 – 90&amp;nbsp;kg once fully kitted up.
•	Whilst performing manoeuvres such as back flips or front flips the pilot can reach up to 4 Gs of force.

==Safety==
The hydroflight industry is full of hazards and potential for things to go wrong. Here is a list of things that pilots must keep their eyes peeled for whilst operating a device.
•	Rocks and other submerged objects can be a very dangerous hazard for all hydroflight participants. Before diving under the water it is best to have a good understanding of what lies beneath the surface and the depth of the water. 
•	Water depth is another critical element to the sport of hydroflight. If the pilot is operating only 1–3 meters above the water, then they should have at least 2 meters of depth below them. If the pilot exceeds 3 meters, then the water depth must now be at a depth of 4 meters.
•	Objects above the water can be as equally as dangerous as any other submerged objects. Whilst flying in the air a pilot must keep on the lookout for any 3D objects such as [[bridges]], [[buoys]], [[boats]], [[jetties]], other hydroflight pilots and the hose and jet ski that they’re attached to.
•	[[Dolphin]] dives is a fantastic manoeuvre that is usually performed more on the jet-boards. Although it looks spectacular it holds a great danger because the pilot is diving head first into the water from any height between 1–15 meters. Whilst performing this manoeuvre it is essential to know how to execute it perfectly and also to have the knowledge of what lies beneath the surface and how much water depth you have to work with.
•	Knee knockouts are the most common of injuries when it comes to advanced manoeuvres. If the pilot bends his knees and goes into a [[squat position]] whilst the board is lifting them up with high power, there is a good chance the knee will make contact with the face.
•	Weather and tides can be hazardous to any pilot no matter their skill level. Tides and currents can play a big factor because if the tide goes out it may take away the valuable water depth that is needed to maintain your safety. If the current is creating rips on the beach, then the pilot can easily drift out of his designated zone or float out to sea if they’re not concentrating. If storms approach it is best to exit the water because there are many electricity conducting components in the jet skis and hydroflight devices that could end up giving you a nasty shock if lighting gets too close.
•	[[Carbon monoxide]] (CO) poisoning can be hazardous to your health and even cause death. To ensure safety you must never get to close to the back of the jet ski where these fumes are released whilst the engine is turned on.
•	Flotation equipment is essential. Always ensure that your PFD has a rating of level 3 and that your chosen hydroflight devices flotation is still buoyant.
•	Not only should their always be someone observing your flight from the jet ski but for extra safety you should also have another on the beach. Always discuss and arrange your hand signals so that all participants are on the same page before starting.

== World Hydroflight Association ==
The World Hydroflight Association (WHFA) is a worldwide organization representing, hydroflight participants, manufacturers, companies and fans. It exists to promote the sport of hydroflight via the safe, responsible operation of hydroflight devices.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldhydroflightassociation.org |title=World Hydroflight Association – The official home of all hydroflight sports |website=Worldhydroflightassociation.org |date=2016-01-13 |accessdate=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldhydroflightassociation.org/|title=World Hydroflight Association – The official home of all hydroflight sports|website=worldhydroflightassociation.org|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Dynamic a-list}}
In [[Australian rules football]], if a player takes a mark or is awarded a free kick shortly before the [[Glossary of Australian rules football#Siren|siren]] sounds to end a quarter, the player is allowed to take the kick after the siren. Often, the result of this kick is of little consequence, but if the player is within range of goal, any score will count towards the final result.

Below is a list of occasions where game results have been decided by set shots taken after the final siren, a play similar to the [[buzzer-beater]] in [[basketball]]. These are highly memorable and often go down in football [[folklore]].

The extra time rule had changed from sudden death to a ten minute period consisting of two five-minute halves, after the previous season's pre-season competition. The sudden death format had caused confusion in the drawn quarter final between West Coast and Hawthorn in 1989, as both teams continued to play after time had expired (without the players knowing) until West Coast scored a behind to win. Essendon eventually won the game in extra time. [http://www.hardballget.net/afl-night-series--pre-season-cup-records--statistics.html Source] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
There have been some cases of a kick after the siren which cannot be properly classified into one of the above tables due to extraordinary circumstances surrounding the outcomes of the games.

He elected to cancel the behind and take a set-shot, which (with the umpires having now heard the siren) was a true after-the-siren kick. He scored another behind, drawing the scores level 94–94. However, four days later, Fremantle successfully challenged to have the result of the game amended to 94–93, reflecting the scoreline when the siren originally sounded. This decision cancelled Baker's kick. For more details see [[AFL siren controversy|''AFL siren controversy'']].

'''[[Mali]]''' made its [[Paralympic Games]] début at the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Sydney]], sending a single representative ([[Facourou Sissoko]]) to compete in powerlifting. In the up to 75kg category, he lifted 130kg - finishing last of the seventeen competitors who successfully lifted a weight. He therefore did not win a medal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=MLI&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Mali at the Paralympics], [[International Paralympic Committee]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mali did not compete at the Paralympic Games in 2004.  Although he was due to compete in [[2008 Summer Paralympics|2008]], as Mali's sole competitor, Sissoko was banned due to testing positive for [[boldenone metabolite]] (a steroid) on the day of the opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/paralympics/2008-09/11/content_7020082.htm "Two more Paralympic powerlifters banned for doping"], [[Xinhua]], September 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahamane Sacko]] represented Mali on the track at the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]], but did not proceed past the heats.

'''Maya Ballgame''', which is a branch of the [[Mesoamerican Ballgame]], is an sport event that was played throughout the [[Maya civilization]]. The Maya civilization was spread out throughout much of Central America. One of the common links of the Mayan culture of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Belize is the game played with a rubber ball, about which we have learned from several sources.&lt;ref&gt;Blumchen.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya ballgame was played with big stone courts. The ball court itself was a focal point of Maya cities and symbolized the city’s wealth and power. The playing arena was in the shape of an I with high platforms on either side of the court allowing for large numbers of spectators. Portable stone court markers known as ''hacha'' usually depicting animals or skulls were placed around the [[arena]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer&lt;/ref&gt; The game was played for 2 weeks.

==History==
[[Image:Uaxactunballcourt.jpg|thumb|left|Ballcourt at [[Uaxactun]], in the [[Petén Basin]] region of the Maya lowlands]]

The Maya ball game originated more than 3,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Blumchen.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Popol Vuh]] describes the history of the [[K'iche' people]] and their rulers and mentions the important position of the Maya ballgame. Through this ball game, a conflict of the forces of darkness and light is described and enacted. By tradition, the twin brothers, [[Hun Hunaphu]] and [[Vucub Hunaphu|Xbalanque]], used their time on earth to play ball. Through the noise of the game, the anger of [[Xibelba|Vucub Came]], the master of the underworld, was aroused. A fight ensued, from which resulted in the formation of the MBG. After the game, one of the brothers was decapitated and his head was used as the game ball. From the decapitated trunk of the player, blood escaped in the form of snakes. This blood was taken as a [[symbol]] of [[fertility]]. This scene is depicted in reliefs on the walls of MBG courts, such as the most famous example in [[Chichen Itza]] in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Blumchen.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological Sites and Finds==
In the highlands of [[Chiapas]] and of [[Guatemala]] alone, 300 MBG courts have been found. Of these, 85% have been dated in the [[post-classic period]].&lt;ref&gt;Blumchen&lt;/ref&gt; Only two early classic courts have been reported and these are at [[Palenque]] and [[Copan]].&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inscriptios===
Murals depicting captives, warriors, Creation myths, and transfers of political power from one ruler to another were painted around the ball court.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public Structure===
The ballcourt in [[Cerros]] is contemporary and date to the [[Tulix ceramic phase]](100BC-100AD).&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough&lt;/ref&gt; Both are similar in date to the other major public structures. Both courts at Cerros are oriented N-S and orient to the N-S medial axis of a pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough&lt;/ref&gt; They are also oriented with the W axis of another pyramid, and its associated plaza, appears to interesect the medial axis of the site of the site at a point approximately  equidistant from either court.&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious Aspects==
The Maya ballgame was more than just an athletic event. It was also a sacrificial and religious event.  The Maya believed that it was necessary to play the game for their own survival. The ballgame provided an opportunity to show devoutness to the gods by sacrificing captured kings and high lords, or the losing opponents of the game.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacrifice and Decapitation===
[[Thirteen Rabbit]]'s ritual sacrifice shows death by decapitation and disembowelment.&lt;ref&gt;Vilcox&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at sculptural portrayals this was most likely the standard technique used at [[El Tajin]]. As trophy heads were popular in Mayan Culture, it follows that they were important in ballgame.&lt;ref&gt;Vilcox&lt;/ref&gt; Some death heads occurred as figurines; so sacred were the small sculptures that they were preserved and appear as offerings at non-elite burials in Late Classic domestic interments.&lt;ref&gt;Vilcox&lt;/ref&gt; As stated earlier, decapitation was used as sacrifice at El Tajin. By looking at sculptures at other ballcourts decapitation was also used at [[Aparicio]], [[Veracruz]], and Chichen Itza, [[Yucatan]].&lt;ref&gt;Vilcox&lt;/ref&gt; Severing of the head is also seen in the Popol Vuh. Some sources say the winning team's captain was decapitated, and at Chichen ìtza you can barely see that a squash and a couple of snakes representing Kuklkan popped out of the sacrificed captains head. This was an honor and the captain would have to accept a drink or food item.&lt;ref&gt;Vilcox&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game-Play==
[[Image:Chichén Itzá Goal.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Ballcourt goal''', [[Chichén Itzá]] ]]

The rules seem to have changed over the centuries. Certainly two teams played against each other. The number of players varied between 2 and 6 players per team. Sometimes, an additional person is seen in the illustrations, who is believed to be a referee. The ball was put in motion by action of the right hip, the right elbow and the right knee and was not permitted to touch the ground. It could be passed from person to person in each team by propulsion by one of the above body parts. The aim was to move the ball back to the opposite team, preferably through the ring. The goal of the opposition (what today might be termed ‘the defense’) was to force the offense to lose control and to allow the ball to touch the ground. The stone ring was an innovation of the late-classic and early post-classic periods, as seen in Chichen Itza and in [[Uxmal]]. Playing the ball off the border wall could intensify the game. The [[ricochet]] of the ball could hardly be anticipated, especially if the walls were uneven.&lt;ref&gt;Blumchen&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equipment===
A rubber ball was always used. Its size and weight varied over the centuries. Most historians assume a weight of 3–4&amp;nbsp;kg and a size of a [[skittle ball]]. The existence of a [[caoutchouc tree]] was necessary to produce the ball. These trees were found in the tropical regions in the Maya territories.&lt;ref&gt;Blumchen&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dress===
The usual dress for MBG players is known from iconographic and figural findings. These show leather protection mainly at the hips and the chest, but sometimes also at the knees and the arms, though very seldom at the feet. The clothing was used to protect against the impact of the ball. The protected parts of the body were used to strike the ball. Some players would wear [[head dresses]] (like deer heads) for [[ritual]] reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Blumchen&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical Aspects of the Ballgame==
Variations in the MBG occurred over the centuries as they have in modern ball games over years of use. Despite the variations, it would appear that the physical loads of MBG were most similar to those of soccer-tennis.&lt;ref&gt;Blumchen&lt;/ref&gt; Most likely the players of ballgame manifested a [[heart rate]] and [[blood pressure]] responses consistent with physical loads of light/moderate intensity, in the range of 4.5–5.5 [[Metabolic equivalent|MET]]s. Thus, the cardiovascular demands of popular sports seem to have remained relatively similar through several millennia.&lt;ref&gt;Blumchen&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metro Gallery Football Club''' ({{zh|t=駿其足球會}}), currently known as '''HONGDA''' for sponsorship reasons, are a Hong Kong [[Association football|football]] club which currently competes in the [[Hong Kong First Division League|Hong Kong First Division]].

The club plays most of its home matches at [[Po Kong Village Road Park]].

==History==
The team began as '''Fourway Athletics''' ({{zh|t=四海體育會}}), it joined [[Hong Kong First Division League|Hong Kong First Division]] in [[2008-09 in Hong Kong football|2008–09 season]] as a competition member ({{zh|t=競賽會員}}, members who pay a specific amount of money and sponsor a domestic cup of Hong Kong to [[the Hong Kong Football Association]], to join the Hong Kong First Division League) of [[the Hong Kong Football Association]].

In [[2009-10 in Hong Kong football|2009–10 season]], Fourway merged with [[Hong Kong Rangers FC|Rangers]] in the [[Hong Kong Second Division League|Hong Kong Second Division]] and was renamed as Fourway Rangers ({{zh|t=四海流浪}}) for the new season.

In [[2011–12 Hong Kong First Division League|2011–12 season]], the team was renamed Biu Chun Rangers in deference to club sponsor ''Biu Chun Watches''.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh-hk icon}} [https://archive.is/20120721074948/http://news.sina.com.hk/news/22/1/1/2419886/1.html 流浪盼足總分擔頻道製作費] Ming Pao. (By Sina.com.hk) 28 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2012–13 Hong Kong First Division League|2012–13 season]], the team was renamed as '''Yokohama FC Hong Kong''' as [[J. League Division 2]] team [[Yokohama F.C.]] purchased the [[Hong Kong Football Association]] membership of the team.

In the [[2013-14 Hong Kong First Division League|2013–14 season]], Yokohama FC Hong Kong moved their home ground from [[Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground]] to [[Tseung Kwan O Sports Ground]], finishing a disappointing 10th in the league.

For the [[2014–15 Hong Kong Premier League|2014–15]] season, the club attained sponsorship from ''Modic Entertainment'' and was thus renamed as '''YFCMD''' (''Yokohama FC Modic''). The team also once again moved stadiums to [[Sham Shui Po Sports Ground]].

In summer 2015, Modic Entertainment confirmed they will not extend the sponsorship contract with the club. Metro Gallery confirmed that they will attain the sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://offside.hk/news/yfcmd-change-name-to-dream-metro-gallery-fc "YFCMD change name to Dreams Metro Gallery FC"] offside.hk. Retrieved on 2015-07-20&lt;/ref&gt; The team was then renamed as '''Dreams Metro Gallery FC'''.

On 6 July 2016, the club announced via Facebook that they would not field a team in the [[2016–17 Hong Kong Premier League|2016–17 season]], instead, choosing to voluntarily drop down to the First Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh-hk icon}} [https://www.facebook.com/DreamsMetroGalleryFC/videos/1644977935821207/ "夢想駿其來季動向事宜"]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South China Morning Post]] reported that the team was facing financial difficulties after failing to attain sponsorship for the Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/sport/hong-kong/article/1985766/special-treatment-guangzhou-rf-will-get-players-concessions-if-they "Special treatment: Guangzhou R&amp;F will get players’ concessions if they compete in Hong Kong Premier League"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Micro Mobility Systems Ltd''', known as '''Micro''', is a company in Switzerland dedicated to invent urban mobility solutions like the [[kickscooter]]  or the Microlino, an electric car, which was first presented at the [[Geneva Motor Show]] in 2016. In the United States, Micro's products are sold under the brand "Micro Kickboard" for [[trademark]] reasons. The company holds several patents for its products.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.kickboardusa.com/blog/about-us/ | publisher = Kickboard USA | title = About Us | date = 2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Idea ===
Wim Ouboter, born in 1960 invented the [[Kick scooter|kickscooter]] out of laziness. He states, that the way from his apartement to his favorite restaurant was too far to go by foot and yet too close to use a bike. He then invented a foldable, two-wheeled Scooter for those kind of distances that could easily be folded anytime and placed in a backpack. He pitched his idea to Smart and they were willing to put one Scooter in every single car. Ouboter then tried to find a manufacturer for his innovation, but soon realized that Europe simply was too expensive. In Taiwan he could convince the owner of a factory to produce the Scooter, also because he had proof that Smart liked his idea. Just before the production could start Smart failed the [[moose test]] and so the project was put on hold, since Smart had to solve that problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.schweizerversicherung.ch/de/artikelanzeige/artikelanzeige_print.asp?pkBerichtNr=27883|title = Verlagsgruppe Handelszeitung|website = www.schweizerversicherung.ch|access-date = 2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation of Micro Mobility Systems ===
But Ouboter had another idea: a three-wheeled Scooter, called the Kickboard. He teamed up with [[K2 Sports|K2]] and presented his idea at the International Sports Fair (ISPO) in Munich in 1998 very successfully. With the earned money he founded Micro Mobility Systems in 1999 and started producing the two-wheeled Scooter, which was an even bigger success. Because of the excessive demand, he allowed his partner in Taiwan to distribute the Scooter in the United States with the name [[Razor (scooter)|Razor]] for a commission. After having sold about one million Scooters in 2000, the sales decreased rapidly in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archiv.rhein-zeitung.de/on/01/06/29/magazin/news/lifboom.html|title = RZ-Online: Der Tretroller ist den Kinderschuhen entwachsen|website = archiv.rhein-zeitung.de|access-date = 2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/039978ae-0d3e-11e0-82ff-00144feabdc0.html#axzz42t3ax48S|title = Scooter pioneer that survived to ride again|last = Simonian|first = Haig|date = 2010-12-21|newspaper = Financial Times|issn = 0307-1766|access-date = 2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Becoming a lifestyle brand ===
In the subsequent years, the company continued to invent new products, designed for urban mobility, like the Mini Micro for kids, the Scooter Luggage or the electric emicro one. In addition, Micro has teamed up with other brands, like Peugeot, Suitsupply or Vibram to name a few. Many celebrities and their kids, like David Beckham and his children, Alessandra Ambrosio or Hugh Jackman have been spotted riding a micro scooter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.micro.ms/blog/view/24596|title = Micro Scooter Worldwide - Headoffice  blog/view|website = www.micro.ms|access-date = 2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.microscooters.com.au/blog/2015/12/david-bekhams-london-sunset-scooting|title = David Beckham's London sunset scooting adventure at micro Scooters Australia|website = www.microscooters.com.au|access-date = 2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Micro Xtreme the brand also went into Freestyle Sports and works closely with professional Athletes like Benjamin Friant. After the huge success in 2000 and the rapid downfall in 2001, Micro has grown organically with a gross revenue in 2014 of 60 Million Swiss Francs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sonntagszeitung.ch/read/sz_06_09_2015/wirtschaft/Die-Rueckkehr-der-Knutschkugel-42448|title = Die Rückkehr der Knutschkugel|website = www.sonntagszeitung.ch|access-date = 2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of the company, manufacturing capacities shifted to [[RazorUSA]] in [[California]]. The evolution of Micro into a lifestyle brand that invents mobility solutions for children, teenagers and adults was honoured by Ernest and Young in 2015, when Wim Ouboter was nominated as Entrepreneur of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ey.com/CH/de/Newsroom/News-releases/EY-Medienmitteilung-Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year-2015-Finalisten|title = EY - Medienmitteilung Entrepreneur Of The Year™ 2015: Finalisten stehen fest|website = www.ey.com|access-date = 2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microlino ===
[[File:Microlino Red Genf 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Microlino at Geneva Motor Show 2016]]
The Microlino was first presented in 2016 at the Geneva Car Show. Based on the design of the [[Isetta]], a  1950s [[bubble car]] which was sold over 160,000 vehicles, the new design has a battery powered electric motor.  The two-seat small car is designed for urban mobility with a top speed of {{convert|90|km/h|mph}}, a range of {{convert|120|km|mi}} and can be charged from a domestic power outlet. The car is expected to be on the market by the end of 2018 with an estimated price of 12,000 Euro and initial sales limited to Germany and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sonntagszeitung.ch/read/sz_06_09_2015/wirtschaft/Die-Rueckkehr-der-Knutschkugel-42448%20http://www.wired.com/2016/03/microlino-modern-bmw-isetta/|title = Sonntagszeitung|website = www.sonntagszeitung.ch|access-date = 2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.wired.com/2016/03/microlino-modern-bmw-isetta/|title = Steve Urkel’s Isetta Finds Second Life as a Teensy Electric Car|website = WIRED|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The company claims to have pre-orders for 8,000 vehicles as of September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=8000 Reservations|url=https://www.micro-mobility.com/en/news/8000-reservations|website=Micro Mobility Systems|accessdate=2 November 2018|date=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nasser bin Ghanim Al-Khelaïfi''' ({{lang-ar|ناصر بن غانم الخليفي}}; born 12 November 1973) is a Qatari [[businessman]] and is the chairman of [[beIN Media Group]],&lt;ref name="beinsportsfrance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mr-yousef-al-obaidly-appointed-president-of-bein-sports-france-260845751.html|title=Mr. Yousef Al-Obaidly Appointed President of beIN SPORTS France|author=beIN SPORTS France|date=27 May 2014|work=prnewswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; chairman of [[Oryx Qatar Sports Investments|Qatar Sports Investments]],&lt;ref name="qsi.com.qa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qsi.com.qa/who-we-are/|title=Who we are|work=qsi.com.qa}}&lt;/ref&gt; president of [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] (PSG), and  [[Qatar Tennis Federation]] (QTF) and vice president of the [[Asian Tennis Federation]] for West Asia (ATF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=qatartennis.org|publisher=[[Qatar Tennis Federation]] (QTF)|title=About Us|url=http://qatartennis.org/about-us.html|accessdate=1 December 2011}} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Khelaïfi is chairman and chief executive officer of [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain Football Club]] in France. He is also a member of the organizing committee for the FIFA Club World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/bodies/standingcommittees/committee=1882024.html|title=FIFA.com - Organising Committee for the FIFA Club World Cup|work=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he was crowned 'favourite Ligue 1 president' and in 2016, ''[[L'Equipe]]'' named him 'the most powerful man in French football'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Al-Khelaïfi : "J'ai beaucoup appris au contact des autres présidents de L1"|url = http://www.francefootball.fr/news/al-khelaa-fi-a-j-ai-beaucoup-appris-au-contact-des-autres-pra-sidents-de-l1a/617754|website = France Football|access-date = 23 February 2016|language = fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==beIN Media Group==
On 31 December 2013, Al Jazeera Sport global operations were spun off from [[Al Jazeera Media Network]] and rebranded as [[beIN Sports]]. In parallel, [[BeIN Media Group]] was incorporated and became the official owner of beIN Sports. Nasser Al-Khelaïfi was then appointed chairman and chief executive officer of beIN Media Group.&lt;ref name="beinsportsfrance"/&gt; beIN Sports has 22 channels including 17 HD channels and broadcasts across the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, North America, Australia and Asia. The strategy, aside from building the beIN premium sports network, is to develop the group's ambitions in sports and entertainment in production, distribution and digital media sectors.

==Qatar Sports Investments==
Nasser Al-Khelaïfi has been chairman of Qatar Sports Investments (QSi) since June 2011. QSi is a fund dedicated to investments in the sport and leisure industry on a national and international level.&lt;ref name="qsi.com.qa"/&gt;

Following the QSi acquisition of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) Football Club in June 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qatari group takes control of Paris Saint-Germain|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/924844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser Al-Khelaifi became the chairman of the board of PSG and also CEO of the club,&lt;ref name="psg.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psg.fr/en/Club/609001/Presidents|title=Presidents - club_presidents - PSG.fr|work=psg.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; reinforcing Qatari interest in French football.

QSi has several other high profile partnerships. They also used to sponsor Spanish football club [[FC Barcelona]]. QSi also owns the [[Burrda (brand)|Burrda]] sportswear brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qsi.com.qa/portfolio/investments/|title=Portfolio|work=qsi.com.qa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris Saint-Germain===

Nasser Al-Khelaïfi became the new chairman and chief executive officer of Paris Saint-Germain in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jean-Claude Blanc Directeur Général Délégué|url=http://www.psg.fr/fr/Article/003001/Article/55345/Jean-Claude-Blanc-Directeur-General-Delegue|date=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after being named chairman he presented a five-year plan to take Paris Saint-German to the top of the tree in France and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PSG: 'We want the new Messi'|url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/article/psg-we-want-the-new-messi.htm|work =[[Ligue 1]]|date=1 July 2011|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the long term plan for the club, Al-Khelaïfi brought in legendary footballer [[Leonardo Araújo|Leonardo]] as the new director of football.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.psg.fr/fr/Club/609001/Presidents PSG.FR : Liste des présidents] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Al-Khelaïfi had initially demanded a major trophy haul for the 2011-2012 season, PSG were soon eliminated from the [[Europa League]] and both domestic cups, leaving the team only able to compete $130&amp;nbsp;million on players, PSG failed to dominate, and lost out to eventual winners [[Montpellier HSC]], though they did qualify for the UEFA Champions League by finishing second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PS aiming to bounce back after French Club failure|url=http://www.supersport.com/football/france/news/140414/PSG_aim_to_bounce_back}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2012-13 Paris Saint-Germain F.C. Season|2012-13 season]], PSG won the [[2012-13 Ligue 1|Ligue 1 title]] and also made it to the [[2012-13 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League]], thanks partly to the goalscoring of newly signed striker, [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]]. They eventually lost in a two-legged tie to [[FC Barcelona]] on away goals.

In the [[2013–14 Paris Saint-Germain F.C. season|2013–14 season]] PSG again finished top of [[2013-14 Ligue 1|Ligue 1]] with a record total of 89 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/psg-foot-paris-saint-germain/les-records-du-psg-cette-saison-19-05-2014-3854175.php#xtref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2F|title=Les records du PSG cette saison|date=19 May 2014|work=leparisien.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reached the [[2013-14 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League]] where they lost to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 3-3 on aggregate, again going out only on the away goals rule.

In June 2012, QSi acquired the Paris Handball Club and merged it with the PSG sport franchise to create a wider and more competitive sport offer to the city of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutes.fr/sport/946487-20120604-apres-psg-qatar-sport-investments-devient-proprietaire-paris-handball|title=Après le PSG, Qatar Sport Investments devient propriétaire du Paris Handball|work=20minutes.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tennis==
As a tennis professional, Al-Khelaïfi was the second most successful member of the [[Qatar Davis Cup team]] after [[Sultan Khalfan]], playing 43 ties between 1992 and 2002 and compiling a 12&amp;ndash;31 record in singles, 12&amp;ndash;16 in doubles. Al-Khelaïfi appeared twice on the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) main tour, losing each time in his first round matches in [[Hypo Group Tennis International|St. Pölten]] in 1996 (where he lost to former French Open Champion [[Thomas Muster]]) and in [[Qatar Open (tennis)|Doha]] in 2001. He reached a career-high singles ranking of No. 995 in late 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=atpworldtour.com|publisher=ATP Tour, Inc.|title=atpworldtour.com Profile|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Al/N/Nasser-Ghanim-Al-Khulaifi.aspx|accessdate=1 December 2011}} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=itftennis.com|publisher=ITF Licensing (UK) Ltd.|title=itftennis.com Men's Circuit record|url=http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=10006160|accessdate=1 December 2011}} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser Al-Khelaïfi has been president of the Qatar Tennis Federation since November 2008. In 2011, he was elected vice-president of the [[Asian Tennis Federation]] for West Asia. Nasser Al-Khelaïfi is a former Davis Cup player and member of the Qatar National Tennis Team with which he won the GCC Team Tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qatartennis.org/sections/index/14/board-of-directors.html|title=Qatar Tennis Federation - QTF - Qatar Tennis Tournaments and Championships|work=qatartennis.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government of Qatar==
In November 2013, Nasser Al-Khelaïfi was made Minister without Portfolio in the Qatari government by the emir of Qatar, [[Sheikh Tamim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football365.fr/etranger/autres-championnats/nasser-al-khelaifi-nomme-ministre-au-qatar-1082524.shtml|title=Nasser Al-Khelaïfi nommé ministre au Qatar|publisher=www.football365.fr|language=French|date=2 December 2013|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Al-Khelaïfi was born in [[Doha]], and graduated from [[Qatar University]]. He is close to the Emir, Sheikh Tamim, head of sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority.

In February 2012, he won a French 'Sport Business' award, receiving the most votes out of 1,500 and finishing ahead of nine people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psg.fr/en/article/003001/article/56883/Al-Khelaifi-receives-Sport-Business-award PSG.FR : Al-Khelaïfi receives Sport Business award]&lt;/ref&gt;

His growing influence in the sport was recognised in 2015 when he was crowned 'favourite Ligue 1 president in a poll conducted by France Football, with 35% of the votes cast. In 2016, the French daily sport [[newspaper]] [[L'Équipe]] named him the 'most powerful man in French football' in a 30-man list, ahead of such notable individuals as [[Didier Deschamps]] and [[Zinedine Zidane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nasser Al Khelaifi {{!}} Le top 30 du foot français - L'ÉQUIPE.FR|url = https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/top30-classement-foot-francais-2015/1/nasser-al-khelaifi|website = lequipe.fr|access-date = 23 February 2016|language = fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1454">'''Peace Bridge Arena'''  was the main sports [[arena]] located in [[Fort Erie, Ontario]].  Built in 1928, it held 5,000 people.  It was located near the [[Peace Bridge]] connecting Fort Erie with Buffalo, New York.  Both the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] and [[Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL)|Pittsburgh Pirates]] made the arena a temporary home for the first few games during the [[1928–29 NHL season]].  

The arena was also the home of the [[Buffalo Bisons (IHL)|Buffalo Bisons]] ice hockey team; for a brief period in 1931, it also served as the backup arena for their crosstown rivals, the [[Buffalo Majors]], who normally played at [[Buffalo Broadway Auditorium]].  On March 17, 1936, the roof collapsed after thirteen inches of heavy snowfall, which ensured the original hockey Bisons' demise.

Eventually, in 1940, [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]], on the American side of the border, would open, replacing both Broadway Auditorium and Peace Bridge Arena; with it, a new [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Bisons]] team would be established.

The '''Sun Bowl''' is an outdoor [[American football|football]] [[stadium]] in the [[Southwestern United States|southwestern]] [[United States]], on the campus of the [[University of Texas at El Paso]]. It is home to the [[UTEP Miners football|UTEP Miners]] of [[Conference USA]], and the late December [[college football]] [[bowl game]], the [[Sun Bowl]]. The stadium opened {{Years or months ago|1963}} in [[1963 college football season|1963]] and has a current [[seating capacity]] of 51,500.

==History==
The stadium, named for the game it hosts, was opened in September [[1963 Sun Bowl|1963]] with a [[UTEP Miners football|Texas Western]] win over [[North Texas Mean Green football|North Texas State]]. The opening play was a 54-yard touchdown run by Larry Durham of the Miners.

The land on which the stadium sits was originally donated by the university to [[El Paso County, Texas|El Paso County]], who built the stadium for the school and the [[Sun Bowl]] game. Both had previously used {{nowrap|[[Kidd Field]],}} the school's current [[track and field]] venue, which seats 15,000. The city had realized that the game could not expand its audience or the list of teams that it could invite without a bigger stadium, so the Sun Bowl was built in a natural bowl adjacent to the west. It originally sat 30,000, with only the sideline grandstands. The playing field runs nearly north–south (tilted about {{nowrap|10° NW–SE)}} at an [[elevation]] of {{convert|3910|ft|round=5}} above [[sea level]].

===Renovations===
The current press box was added in [[1969 Sun Bowl|1969]], and the stadium reached the capacity of 52,000 in [[1982 Sun Bowl|1982]] with the addition of the north end zone stands and the expansion of the east stands. (The south end zone is still vacant, with the ground of the bowl covered with the school's logos.)

The school retook control of the land and stadium in [[2001 UTEP Miners football team|2001]], when hundreds of seats were removed as part of a re-configuration of the seating bowl to accommodate [[Association football|soccer]], which lowered capacity to its current figure of 51,500.&lt;ref name="cap"/&gt;

The school's Athletics Director, [[Jim Senter (athletic director)|Jim Senter]], announced on April 13, 2018 plans to renovate the Sun Bowl Stadium. The $15 million dollar project would include luxury boxes installed in a new press facility, renovation of the concourses and premium seating added on the west side of the stadium. The renovations are projected to be completed in a 16-month timespan.

'''Vicarage Road''', a stadium in [[Watford]], Hertfordshire, England, is the home of the [[association football|football]] club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] of the [[Premier League]]. An all-seater stadium, its current capacity is 23,700 following  the completion of the new Sir Elton John Stand in 2014, and expansion work in 2015 and again throughout 2016 and 2017; this included expansion of the football pitch.&lt;ref name=FootballLeague&gt;[http://www.football-league.co.uk/clubs/20100801/watford_2293498_692872 Watford: Club info] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421020630/http://www.football-league.co.uk/clubs/20100801/watford_2293498_692872 |date=21 April 2012 }}.

==History==
It has been the home of Watford since 1922, when the club moved from [[Cassio Road]].&lt;ref name=WhosWho&gt;Trefor Jones (1996). ''The Watford Football Club Illustrated Who's Who.'' T.G. Jones. p. 9. {{ISBN|0-9527458-0-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ground was officially opened by Col. Charles Healey of [[Benskins Brewery]] for the visit of [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] on 30 August 1922. In addition to being Watford's home since opening, the stadium was also home to [[Wealdstone F.C.]] between 1991 and 1993,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wealdstonefc.co.uk/page.php?history.htm Wealdstone Football Club history]. Wealdstone Football Club Supporters Club. Accessed 2 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[rugby union]] side [[Saracens F.C.|Saracens]] from 1997 until they moved to their new home at [[Allianz Park]] in February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Allnutt, Tom (22 January 2013).

After purchasing the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] of the stadium from Benskins in January 2002, Watford's financial situation forced them to sell and lease back the stadium later that year.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Conn]] (21 September 2002). [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1712032.html New owners of Vicarage Road revealed as Watford wither]. ''[[The Independent]]''. Accessed 2 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a campaign entitled 'Let's Buy Back The Vic' with donations coming from fans, as well as celebrity former owner [[Elton John]] donating the entire proceeds of a concert held at the venue, the club was able to repurchase the stadium in September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham Simpson (businessman)|Graham Simpson]] (31 March 2005).

==Vicarage Road Stand==
[[File:Vicarageroad1.jpg|thumb|left|Rugby game at Vicarage Road, 2005]]
The Vicarage Road Stand was built following the conclusion of the 1992–93 season. Previously an open terrace, the all-seater stand was built to comply with the [[Taylor Report]] and raise the standard of the ground. It cost £2.3&amp;nbsp;million to build and had a capacity of 5,800 people. Construction was largely funded by the £1.2m sale of [[Bruce Dyer]] in 1994.&lt;ref name=HarrowTimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trefor Jones (1996). ''The Watford Football Club Illustrated Who's Who.'' T.G. Jones. p. 75. {{ISBN|0-9527458-0-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally a mere earth bank when the club moved to the ground, it was gradually transformed into a conventional terrace. In 1978, an electronic scoreboard was put up, which became an iconic symbol of Watford's eighties heyday. In a display of solidarity with the home support, [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] maintained that the benches for the coaching staff and substitute on the side of the pitch would remain exposed to the elements until such time as the home end was covered.&lt;!--Paragraph covered by Phillips book--&gt;

Its final game as a terrace was a 1–0 loss to [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] on 8 May 1993. It opened to the public once more on 18 September 1993, with Watford defeating [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfc.net/stadium.htm|title=The Stadium|publisher=wfc.net|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously the home stand, it now houses the away support. A partition was subsequently added, meaning that both home and away support could be put in the stand. Half of the stand is given to away fans, and the other half is used as the family area for home fans. It also houses wheelchair supporters of both teams.&lt;!--Sourced to stadium plan--&gt; Since August 2012, the stand has been home to the Hornets Shop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/120810-hornets-shop-move-305371.aspx|title=RETAIL: New Home For The Hornets Shop|publisher=Watford Football Club|date=10 August 2012|accessdate=3 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503045413/http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/120810-hornets-shop-move-305371.aspx|archivedate=3 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Rookery Stand==
[[File:Rookery, Vicarage Road.jpg|thumb|alt=Part of a stadium, consisting of yellow and red seats. A grass football pitch is visible to the left.|The Rookery Stand]]
The Rookery Stand was built over the course of the [[1994-95 in English football|1994–95 season]]. Another former terrace, the all-seater Rookery stand has a capacity of 6,960. Larger than the Vicarage Road stand, it has facilities on two levels and also holds most of the club's administrative areas. The stand cost £1.6&amp;nbsp;million to build, approximately £300,000 of this figure was contributed by the Football Trust, with the remaining money coming from the £2.3m sale of [[Paul Furlong]] by then-owner [[Jack Petchey]] in 1994.&lt;ref name=HarrowTimes&gt;[http://www.harrowtimes.co.uk/news/295444.the_details_are_petchey/ The details are Petchey]. ''Harrow Times''. 7 May 2003. Accessed 2 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trefor Jones (1996). ''The Watford Football Club Illustrated Who's Who.'' T.G. Jones. p. 91. {{ISBN|0-9527458-0-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Watford moved from Cassio Road, this end of the ground featured a roof over a cinder bank, and over the years the roof eventually had to be removed for safety reasons. The Supporters' Club eventually raised funds to enable the Rookery End to feature concrete terracing under cover, and this aim was realised in 1959.&lt;!--Paragraph covered by Phillips book--&gt;

The new stand, replacing the 1959 model was used by Watford supporters for the first time on 22 April 1995, for the visit of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. As part of redevelopment work in conjunction with the Watford Health Campus, 164 units of affordable housing, known locally as ''The Wrap'', were built on and around the Rookery end. Construction finished in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Hill (4 November 2009).

==The Graham Taylor Stand==

The Graham Taylor Stand was renamed for the 2014–15 season, taking its name from the club's most successful manager [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140501-the-graham-taylor-stand-1520316.aspx|title=GRAHAM TAYLOR OBE: Hornets To Honour Former Manager With Stand Re-Naming|publisher=Watford Football Club|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=3 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503044213/http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140501-the-graham-taylor-stand-1520316.aspx|archivedate=3 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously named after former [[FIFA]] president Sir [[Stanley Rous]]. The official renaming ceremony took place on 29 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/watford-fc-graham-taylor-stand-gallery-2111076.aspx|title=GALLERY: Graham Taylor Stand First Look|publisher=Watford Football Club|date=28 November 2014|accessdate=29 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201051251/http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/watford-fc-graham-taylor-stand-gallery-2111076.aspx|archivedate=1 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stand with its distinctive wavy roof runs along the side of the pitch, on the west side of the ground. It is a two-tiered stand, with executive boxes and a TV&amp;nbsp;camera gantry.&lt;!--Paragraph covered by Phillips book--&gt; Built in 1986, it replaced the Shrodells Stand. The £3 million development was partly funded via a loan from [[Elton John]]. The upper tier, complete with executive boxes, was constructed first, and temporary seats forming a lower-tier were added later. These were later replaced with permanent seats, first used for a game against [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on 18 September 1993.&lt;!--First three sentences covered by Phillips book--&gt;

When the club moved from [[Cassio Road]] in 1922, the Union Stand was transported and reconstructed on this side of the ground. It was replaced by the Shrodells Stand, which was constructed during the 1930s. It was extended in 1979 with a further 2,200 seats replacing the standing enclosure in front of the stand.&lt;!--Paragraph covered by Phillips book--&gt;

The final match for the Shrodells Stand was a 1–1 draw against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 3 May 1986, the Graham Taylor Stand opened on 23 August 1986, when Oxford United visited Vicarage Road, with Watford coming out 3–0 winners.&lt;!--Paragraph covered by Phillips book--&gt;

==The Sir Elton John Stand==
[[File:Main Stand.jpg|thumb|The now demolished Main Stand]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Elton John Stand.jpg|thumb|right|The Sir Elton John Stand]] --&gt;
The Sir Elton John Stand sits on the east side of the ground, and contains the changing rooms &amp; tunnel. The stand was fully opened on 13 December 2014, in a ceremony attended by [[Sir Elton John]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/141213-gallery-watford-fc-v-wigan-elton-john-2145481.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305020005/http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/141213-gallery-watford-fc-v-wigan-elton-john-2145481.aspx |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the development of the Sir Elton John Stand, the east side of the ground was home to the Main Stand, which was constructed in 1922 following Watford FC's move from Cassio Road. The Main Stand was closed in 2008 due to safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watfordfc.com/page/Stadium/0,,10400~2069271,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512044614/http://www.watfordfc.com/page/Stadium/0,,10400~2069271,00.html|archivedate=12 May 2012|title=East stand changes|publisher=Watford Football Club|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the acquisition of Watford FC by the Pozzo family in 2012, the club were able to finance the development of a new stand to replace the Main Stand. The redevelopment of the east side of the stadium began in 2013, with the aim of developing a 3,000 seater capacity stand which would also house the players changing rooms, television gantry and tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/130923-east-stand-contract-1071880.aspx "East Stand IS Happening"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926210503/http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/130923-east-stand-contract-1071880.aspx |date=26 September 2013 }}.

In May 2014, it was announced the stand will be known as The Watford FC Community Stand. However the club announced in November 2014 that the new stand would instead be named after former chairman Sir Elton John.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140501-the-watford-fc-community-stand-1521713.aspx|title=Name Confirmed: The Watford FC Community Stand|publisher=Watford Football Club|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=3 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503090301/http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/140501-the-watford-fc-community-stand-1521713.aspx|archivedate=3 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changing rooms were used for the first time in a friendly match between Watford and Udinese on 2 August 2014.

On 8 June 2015, the club confirmed that 700 extra seats were being installed in the recently built Sir Elton John Stand.&lt;ref name="ground expand 2"/&gt; This number was revised a day later to around 1000 extra seats, following the announcement of an expansion in the north-east corner.&lt;ref name="ground expand 2"/&gt;

==Floodlights==
The first game under [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] at Vicarage Road was played in 1953, when lights were installed on top of the Main Stand. These were replaced in 1960, with four pylons being built in the corners of the ground. Currently the floodlights are mounted on the top of the Vicarage Road and Rookery Stands.&lt;!--Paragraph covered by Phillips book--&gt;  New LED floodlights have been added for the 2015/16 season including lights on the top of the Sir Elton John and Graham Taylor stands.

==Railway stations==
[[File:Croxley rail link stations old and new.png|thumb|The old and new stations on the Croxley Rail Link near Vicarage Road]]
In 1982, Vicarage Road Stadium gained its own railway station, {{rws|Watford Stadium Halt}}. It was introduced as a means of [[crowd control|managing the crowds]] attending football matches, providing an alternative to {{rws|Watford High Street}} and {{rws|Watford Junction}}, and was only open on match days. Development of the station was funded jointly by the [[Football Trust]], [[Watford Borough Council]], Watford F.C. and [[British Rail]]. The station was officially opened on 4 December 1982 by Elton John and [[Morys Bruce, 4th Baron Aberdare|Lord Aberdare]], chairman of the Football Trust. The inaugural train rolled into the station five minutes late, bringing away fans of [[Manchester United]] to Vicarage Road; the match that day ended with a 1–0 defeat for Watford.&lt;ref name=WO-station&gt;{{cite news|last=Crozier|first=David|title=Elton rides in to open soccer halt|url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/nostalgia/memories/10593045.Elton_rides_in_to_open_soccer_halt/|accessdate=12 August 2013|newspaper=Watford Observer|date=11 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812123903/http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/nostalgia/memories/10593045.Elton_rides_in_to_open_soccer_halt/|archive-date=12 August 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station fell out of use when [[British Rail]] closed the railway line in 1996 and has remained derelict ever since. A new [[London Underground]] station, {{LUL stations |station=Watford Vicarage Road}}, is due to open in 2020 on the opposite side of the Vicarage Road bridge as part of the [[Croxley Rail Link]] project to extend the [[Metropolitan line]] to [[Watford Junction railway station|Watford Junction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Croxley Rail Link|url=http://www.croxleyraillink.com/|accessdate=11 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102174226/http://www.croxleyraillink.com/|archive-date=2 November 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However since March 2017 the project has been in doubt due to a significant shortfall in funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/metropolitan-line-extension-to-watford-junction-could-be-axed-due-to-funding-gap-a3490276.html|title=Metropolitan line extension could be axed due to £50m funding gap|date=2017-03-15|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2017-05-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greyhound racing initially began at Vicarage Road on 20 October 1928. The racing was held under [[National Greyhound Racing Club]] (NGRC) rules and as many as four race nights per week were held every Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 7.45pm. However the provisional NGRC licence was cancelled as early as 1 November 1928, forcing the track to race independently (unaffiliated to a governing body).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Encyclopedia of Greyhound Racing|year=1981|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=07207-1106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racing would continue for many years alongside the football team and was still active for the next forty years before a temporary closure on 28 June 1969. On 14 October 1974 racing returned under NGRC rules under the organisation of the industry’s leading promoter the [[Greyhound Racing Association]]. Derby winning trainer Barbara Tompkins was attached to the track and won the Buckinghamshire Cup at [[Slough Stadium]] in 1975 with Houghton Girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=NGRC book of Greyhound Racing|year=1990|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=0-7207-1804-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape of track was very sharp due to the nature of the bend design around the football pitch corners and this led to criticism within the industry that it was not safe enough. Despite this a Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS) contract was established at the track. During 1977 the club announced plans to end the greyhound racing so that stadium improvements could go ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/remember-november-3/|title=Greyhound Star (Remember When November 1977)|publisher=Greyhound Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final race meeting took place on 30 October 1978. The last winner was a greyhound called Chad Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wells Fargo Arena''' (formerly '''ASU Activity Center''') is a 14,000-seat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ASU Reduces Capacity at Wells Fargo Arena|first=Doug|last=Haller|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/asu/articles/2010/12/04/20101204asu-basketball-reduce-wells-fargo-arena-capacity.html|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|location=Phoenix|date=December 4, 2010|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; multi-purpose [[arena]] located at 600 E Veterans Way in [[Tempe, Arizona]], a suburb of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].

Constructed in the spring of 1974 as the ASU Activity Center and at the cost of $8 million, it is the home of multiple [[Arizona State University]] athletic teams, to include [[Arizona State Sun Devils men's basketball|men's basketball]], women's basketball, women's volleyball, women's gymnastics, and men's wrestling. The facility also plays host to graduation ceremonies and a variety of concerts and shows. The building replaced [[Sun Devil Gym]] as the primary arena for the Sun Devils' basketball team.

Naming rights for the arena were purchased by [[Wells Fargo &amp; Co.]] in 1997.

==Design==
The structure is 403 feet long, 340 feet wide and six stories high. The structure contains offices and locker rooms for men's basketball, women's basketball, women's volleyball, and the men's and women's track and field team, along with a weight room, coaches and film rooms, and an equipment room.

==Events==

[[Led Zeppelin]] played their third-to-last show as part of their [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|1977 North American Tour]]

[[Bruce Springsteen]] &amp; the [[E Street Band]] performed at the arena on November 5, 1980 during the [[The River Tour|River Tour]]. Video and audio of the show were released in 2015 in conjunction with the band's ''[[The River (Bruce Springsteen album)#The Ties That Bind: The River Collection|The Ties That Bind]]'' commemorative box set, and their performance of "[[Badlands (Bruce Springsteen song)|Badlands]]" was included on 1986's ''[[Live 1975–85]]'' album.

The arena hosted the first dates of [[U2]]'s [[The Joshua Tree Tour|Joshua Tree Tour]] in March 1987, with the tour eventually concluding next door at [[Sun Devil Stadium]] in December of that year.

It hosted the 1990 [[Pac-12 Conference|Pacific-10 Conference]] men's basketball tournament.  Previously, the Sun Devils played at [[Sun Devil Gym]].

The arena has also hosted the 1st and 2nd rounds of the [[NCAA]] Women's Basketball Tournament in both [[2015 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|2015]] and [[2016 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|2016]].
