The term '''anal retentive''' (also '''anally retentive'''), often abbreviated to '''anal''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/anal-retentive |title=anal-retentive |work=Memidex/WordNet Dictionary/Thesaurus |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to describe a person who pays such attention to detail that it becomes an obsession and may be an annoyance to others, potentially to the detriment of the anal-retentive person. The term derives from [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]].

==Origins==
In Freudian psychology, the [[anal stage]] is said to follow the [[oral stage]] of [[infant development|infant]] or [[Child development|early-childhood development]]. This is a time when an infant's attention moves from oral stimulation to anal stimulation (usually the [[bowel]]s but occasionally the [[bladder]]), usually synchronous with learning to control their excretory functions—in other words, any form of child training and not specifically linked to toilet training.  Freud posited that children who experience conflicts, in which libido energy is under-indulged during this period of time, and the child is perhaps too strongly chastised for toilet-training accidents, may develop "anal retentive" fixations or personality traits.  These traits are associated with a child's efforts at excretory control: orderliness, stubbornness, and compulsions for control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Hall |first = Calvin S. |title = A Primer of Freudian Psychology |publisher = [[New American Library]] |year = 1954 |location = New York |page = 108 |isbn = 0-452-01183-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, those who are overindulged during this period may develop "[[anal-expulsive]]" personality types.

Freud's theories on early childhood have been influential on the [[psychological]] community; the phrase ''anal retentive'' and the term ''anal'' survive in common usage. The second edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (DSM-II) introduced [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD), with a definition based on Freud's description of anal-retentive personality.&lt;ref name="Pinto 2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinto |first=Anthon y|first2=Jane L. |last2=Eisen |first3=Maria C. |last3=Mancebo |first4=Steven A. |last4=Rasmussen |year=2008 |publisher=Elsevier |pages=246–263 |title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Subtypes and Spectrum Conditions |chapter=Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder |editor-first1=Jonathan S. |editor-last1=Abramowitz |editor-first2=Dean |editor-last2=McKay |editor-first3=Steven |editor-last3=Taylor |isbn=978-0-08-044701-8 |chapter-url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/B9780080447018500164/3-s2.0-B9780080447018500164-main.pdf?_tid=5e5920c6-6e10-11e6-8885-00000aab0f02&amp;acdnat=1472492906_7d594e8d9e99c696b9336666dab25769}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the association between OCPD and toilet training is largely regarded as unsupported "[[Popular psychology|pop-psychology]]" and therefore discredited by the majority of psychologists of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=berger&gt;{{cite book |last = Berger |first = Kathleen |title = The Developing Person |publisher = Worth Publishers |year = 2000 |location = New York |pages = 218 |isbn = 1-57259-417-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no conclusive research linking anal stage conflicts with "anal" personality types.&lt;ref name="berger" /&gt; Research suggests that the overall pattern of [[Parenting styles|parental attitudes]] has a much more concrete effect on how an infant will grow up.

'''Analogical models''' are a method of representing a phenomenon of the world, often called the "target system" by another, more understandable or analysable system. They are also called '''dynamical analogies'''.

Two [[open system (systems theory)|open systems]] have ''analog'' representations (see illustration) if they are [[black box]] [[isomorphism#Applications|isomorphic systems]].

== Explanation ==

[[Analogy|Analogizing]] is the process of representing information about a particular subject (the analogue or source system) by another particular subject (the target system). A simple type of analogy is one that is based on shared properties (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). Analogical models, also called "analog" or "analogue" models, therefore seek the analog systems that share properties with the target system as a means of representing the world. It is often practicable to construct source systems that are smaller and/or faster than the target system so that one can deduce ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' [[knowledge]] of target system behaviour. Analog devices are therefore those in which may differ in substance or structure but share properties of dynamic behaviour (Truit and Rogers, p.&amp;nbsp;1-3).

{{cquote|dynamical analogies establish the analogies between electrical, mechanical, acoustical, magnetic and electronic systems}} (Olson 1958, p.&amp;nbsp;2).

For example, in analog electronic circuits, one can use [[voltage]] to represent an arithmetic quantity; [[operational amplifier]]s might then represent the arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).Through the process of [[calibration]] these smaller/bigger, slower/faster systems are scaled up or down so that they match the functioning of the target system, and are therefore called analogs of the target system. Once the calibration has taken place, modellers speak of a ''one-to-one correspondence in behaviour'' between the primary system and its analog. Thus the behaviour of two systems can be determined by experimenting with one.
&lt;!--This doesn't seem right. Is the "model" the "target system" or the "analogue/source system"? It seems that Stanford encyclopedia and Wikipedia do not mesh!--&gt;

==Creating an analogical model==

Many different instruments and systems can be used to create an analogical model. A mechanical device can be used to represent mathematical calculations. For instance, the Phillips Hydraulic Computer [[MONIAC]] used the flow of water to model economic systems (the target system); electronic circuits can be used to represent both physiological and ecological systems. When a model is run on either an analog or digital computer this is known as the process of [[simulation]].
&lt;!-- EXAMPLES! WE NEED EXAMPLES! --&gt;

==Mechanical analogies==
{{Main|Mechanical-electrical analogies}}
Any number of systems could be used for mapping electrical phenomena to mechanical phenomena, but two principle systems are commonly used: the [[impedance analogy]] and the [[mobility analogy]]. The impedance analogy maps force to voltage whereas the mobility analogy maps force to current.

The impedance analogy preserves the analogy between [[electrical impedance]] and [[mechanical impedance]] but does not preserve the network topology. The mobility analogy preserves the network topology but does not preserve the analogy between impedances. Both preserve the correct energy and power relationships by making [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|power conjugate pairs]] of variables analogous.

==Hydraulic analogy==
*In a [[hydraulic analogy]], a [[water integrator]] might perform the mathematical operation of [[integral|integration]].

==Physiological analogies==
*[[Francis Crick]] used the study of the [[visual system]] as a proxy for the study of [[awareness]].

==Formal analogies==
&lt;!--Needs to be filled--&gt;
*"The same [[equation]]s have the same [[solution]]s." -- [[Richard Feynman]]
**For example, the inverse-square laws of [[gravitation]] and [[electromagnetism]] can be described by analogous equations on a geometrical basis, almost without regard to the physical details about [[mass]]es and [[charge (physics)|charges]].
**In [[population ecology]], [[differential equation]]s arise that are the same as those found in [[mechanics]], albeit with different interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzburg and Colyvan 2004; Colyvan and Ginzburg 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Recursion]] requires a similarity within a situation; for example, [[Archimedes]] used the [[myriad]] to count the [[The Sand Reckoner|number of grains of sand on a beach]] by using the concept of myriad myriads.

==Dynamical analogies==
Dynamical analogies establish analogies between systems in different energy domains by means of comparison of the system dynamic equations. There are many ways such analogies can be built, but one of the most useful methods is to form analogies between pairs of [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|power conjugate variables]]. That is, a pair of variables whose product is [[Power (physics)|power]]. Doing so preserves the correct energy flow between domains, a useful feature when modelling a system as an integrated whole. Examples of systems that require unified modelling are [[mechatronics]] and [[audio electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest such analogy is due to [[James Clerk Maxwell]] who, in 1873, associated mechanical [[force]] with electrical [[voltage]]. This analogy became so widespread that sources of voltage are still today referred to as [[electromotive force]]. The power conjugate of voltage is [[electric current]] which, in the Maxwell analogy, maps to mechanical [[velocity]]. [[Electrical impedance]] is the ratio of voltage and current, so by analogy, [[mechanical impedance]] is the ratio of force and velocity. The concept of impedance can be extended to other domains, for instance in acoustics and fluid flow it is the ratio of pressure to rate of flow. In general, impedance is the ratio of an ''effort'' variable and the ''flow'' variable that results. For this reason, the Maxwell analogy is often referred to as the [[impedance analogy]], although the concept of impedance was not conceived until 1886 by [[Oliver Heaviside]], some time after Maxwell's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Bishop, p. 8.4|Busch-Vishniac, p. 20|Smith, p. 1648|Martinsen &amp; Grimnes, p. 287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifying power conjugate variables still does not result in a unique analogy, there are multiple ways the conjugates and analogies can be specified. A new analogy was proposed by Floyd A. Firestone in 1933 now known as the [[mobility analogy]]. In this analogy electrical impedance is made analogous to mechanical mobility (the inverse of mechanical impedance). Firestone's idea was to make analogous variables that are measured across an element, and make analogous variables that flow through an element. For instance, the ''across'' variable voltage is the analogy of velocity, and the ''through'' variable current is the analogy of force. Firestone's analogy has the advantage of preserving the topology of element connections when converting between domains. A modified form of the through and across analogy was proposed in 1955 by [[Horace M. Trent]] and is the modern understanding of ''through and across''.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Bishop, p. 8.2|Smith, p. 1648|Busch-Vishniac, p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hamiltonian variables===
The Hamiltonian variables, also called the energy variables, are those variables which when time [[derivative|differentiated]] are equal to the power conjugate variables. The Hamiltonian variables are so called because they are the variables which usually appear in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. The Hamiltonian variables in the electrical domain are [[electric charge|charge]] (''q'') and [[flux linkage]] (λ) because,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d \lambda}{dt} = v &lt;/math&gt; ([[Faraday's law of induction]]) and, &lt;math&gt;\frac {dq}{dt} = i&lt;/math&gt;

In the translational mechanical domain the Hamiltonian variables are distance [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] (''x'') and [[momentum]] (''p'') because,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dp}{dt} = F &lt;/math&gt; ([[Newton's second law|Newton's second law of motion]]) and, &lt;math&gt;\frac {dx}{dt} = u&lt;/math&gt;

There is a corresponding relationship for other analogies and sets of variables.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamiltonian variables are also called the energy variables. The [[integrand]] of a power conjugate variable with respect to a Hamiltonian variable is a measure of energy. For instance,
:&lt;math&gt; \int F dx &lt;/math&gt; and, &lt;math&gt; \int u dp &lt;/math&gt;
are both expressions of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Borutzky, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practical uses===
Maxwell's analogy was initially used merely to help explain electrical phenomena in more familiar mechanical terms. The work of Firestone, Trent and others moved the field well beyond this, looking to represent systems of multiple energy domains as a single system. In particular, designers started converting the mechanical parts of an electromechanical system to the electrical domain so that the whole system could be analyzed as an electrical circuit. [[Vannevar Bush]] was a pioneer of this kind of modelling in his development of [[analogue computer]]s, and a coherent presentation of this method was presented in a 1925 paper by Clifford A. Nickle.&lt;ref&gt;Care, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s onward, manufacturers of [[mechanical filter]]s, notably [[Collins Radio]], widely used these analogies in order to take the well -developed theory of [[filter design]] in electrical engineering and apply it to mechanical systems. The quality of filters required for radio applications could not be achieved with electrical components. Much better quality resonators (higher [[Q factor]]) could be made with mechanical parts but there was no equivalent filter theory in mechanical engineering. It was also necessary to have the mechanical parts, the [[transducer]]s, and the electrical components of the circuit analyzed as a complete system in order to predict the overall response of the filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Taylor &amp; Huang, p. 378|Carr, pp. 170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harry F. Olson]] helped popularise the use of dynamical analogies in the audio electronics field with his book ''dynamical analogies'' first published in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Libbey, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-power-conjugate analogies===

A common analogy of magnetic circuits maps [[magnetomotive force]] (mmf) to voltage and [[magnetic flux]] (φ) to electrical current. However, mmf and φ are not power conjugate variables. The product of these is not in units of power and the ratio, known as [[magnetic reluctance]], does not measure the rate of dissipation of energy so is not a true impedance. Where a compatible analogy is required, mmf can be used as the effort variable and ''dφ/dt'' (rate of change of magnetic flux) will then be the flow variable. This is known as the [[gyrator-capacitor model]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamill, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely used analogy in the thermal domain maps temperature difference as the effort variable and thermal power as the flow variable. Again, these are not power conjugate variables, and the ratio, known as [[thermal resistance]], is not really an analogy of either impedance or electrical resistance as far as energy flows are concerned. A compatible analogy could take temperature difference as the effort variable and [[entropy]] flow rate as the flow variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Busch-Vishniac, p. 19|Regtien, p. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalisation===

Many applications of dynamical models convert all energy domains in the system into an electrical circuit and then proceed to analyse the complete system in the electrical domain. There are, however, more generalised methods of representation. One such representation is through the use of [[bond graph]]s, introduced by Henry M. Paynter in 1960. It is usual to use the force-voltage analogy (impedance analogy) with bond graphs, but it is not a requirement to do so. Likewise Trent used a different representation (linear graphs) and his representation has become associated with the force-current analogy (mobility analogy), but again this is not mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, p. 8.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors discourage the use of domain specific terminology for the sake of generalisation. For instance, because much of the theory of dynamical analogies arose from electrical theory the power conjugate variables are sometimes called ''V-type'' and ''I-type'' according to whether they are analogs of voltage or current respectively in the electrical domain. Likewise, the Hamiltonian variables are sometimes called ''generalised momentum'' and ''generalised displacement'' according to whether they are analogs of momentum or displacement in the mechanical domain.&lt;ref&gt;Borutzky, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic circuit analogies==

===Hydraulic analogy===
A fluid or [[hydraulic analogy]] of an electric circuit attempts to explain circuitry intuitively in terms of plumbing, where water is analogous to the mobile sea of charge within metals, pressure difference is analogous to [[voltage]], and water's flow rate is analogous to [[electric current]].

===Analogue computers===
Electronic circuits were used to model and simulate engineering systems such as aeroplanes and nuclear power plants before digital computers became widely available with fast enough turn over times to be practically useful. Electronic circuit instruments called [[analog computer]]s were used to speed up circuit construction time. However analog computers like the [[Norden bombsight]] could also consist of gears and pulleys in calculation.

Examples are Vogel and Ewel who published 'An Electrical Analog of a Trophic Pyramid' (1972, Chpt 11, pp.&amp;nbsp;105–121), Elmore and Sands (1949) who published circuits devised for research in nuclear physics and the study of fast electrical transients done under the Manhattan Project (however no circuits having application to weapon technology were included for security reasons), and [[Howard T. Odum]] (1994) who published circuits devised to analogically model ecological-economic systems at many scales of the geobiosphere.

==Philosophical conundrum==
The process of analogical modelling has philosophical difficulties. As noted in the [http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/stanford/entries/models-science/#ModLawNat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy], there is the question of how the physical/biological laws of the target system relate to the analogical models created by humans to represent the target system. We seem to assume that the process of constructing analogical models gives us access to the fundamental laws governing the target system. However strictly speaking we only have empirical knowledge of the laws that hold true for the analogical system, and if the time constant for the target system is larger than the life cycle of human being (as in the case of the geobiosphere) it is therefore very difficult for any single human to empirically verify the validity of the extension of the laws of their model to the target system in their lifetime.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11297">The '''assessment of basic language and learning skills''' (ABLLS, often pronounced "ables") is an educational tool used frequently with [[applied behavior analysis]] (ABA) to measure the basic linguistic and functional skills of an individual with developmental delays or disabilities.

==Development==
The revised assessment of basic language and learning skills (ABLLS-R) is an assessment tool, curriculum guide, and skills-tracking system used to help guide the instruction of language and critical learner skills for children with autism or other developmental disabilities.  It provides a comprehensive review of 544 skills from 25 skill areas including language, social interaction, self-help, academic and motor skills that most typically developing children acquire prior to entering kindergarten.  Expressive language skills are assessed based upon the behavioral analysis of language as presented by Dr. B.F. Skinner in his book, Verbal Behavior (1957).  The task items within each skill area are arranged from simpler to more complex tasks.  This practical tool facilitates the identification of skills needed by the child to effectively communicate and learn from everyday experiences.  The information obtained from this assessment allows parents and professionals to pinpoint obstacles that have been preventing a child from acquiring new skills and to develop a comprehensive language-based curriculum.
  
The ABLLS-R comprises two documents.  The ABLLS-R Protocol is used to score the child’s performance on the task items and provides 15 appendices that allow for the tracking of a variety of specific skills that are included in the assessment.  The ABLLS-R Guide provides information about the features of the ABLLS-R, how to correctly score items, and how to develop Individualized Education Program (IEP) goals and objectives that clearly define and target the learning needs of a student.  

The original version was first released in 1998 by [http://www.behavioranalysts.com Behavior Analysts, Inc.] and was developed by James W. Partington, Ph.D., BCBA-D and Mark L. Sundberg, Ph.D, BCBA-D.  It was revised in 2006 by  Partington.  The revised version incorporates many new task items and provides a more specific sequence in the developmental order of items within the various skill areas.  Significant changes were made in the revised version of the vocal imitation section with input from Denise Senick-Pirri, SLP-CCC.  Additional improvements were made to incorporate items associated with social interaction skills, motor imitation and other joint attention skills, and to ensure the fluent use of established skills.

==WebABLLS and normative data==

The [http://www.webablls.com WebABLLS] is an electronic version of the assessment.  It allows parents, teachers, speech pathologists, behavior analysts, and others who design, coordinate, or supervise language or skill-acquisition programs to expedite the development of IEPs, progress reports, and to easily share information about a child.  The WebABLLS provides videos of many skills that are measured by the ABLLS-R and can be used to demonstrate those specific skills.

Over the past four years, parents, relatives and friends of typically developing children have been participating in an ongoing research project by entering data into the WebABLLS.  The data are collected by parents or professionals who both know the children and have received training in the administration of the ABLLS-R.  The data are updated at three-month intervals (i.e., 6 months, 9 months, 12 months) in order to track the specific changes in skills over the course of the children’s development.  These preliminary data have been collected in a systematic manner to provide information about when each skill measured by the ABLLS-R is usually acquired by typically developing children.  

The preliminary data from this research project are from 81 children (42 females &amp; 39 males) ranging in age from 6 months to 60 months.  Children are from a variety of geographical locations (both nationally and internationally) and of differing ethnic, socio-economic and educational backgrounds.  The average percent of the total possible scores along with the range from the highest to the lowest scores for the sample at each 3-month age intervals are presented.  The data clearly indicate that typically developing children demonstrate most of the basic language and learning skills measured by the ABLLS-R by the time they are 4 to 5 years of age.

==Usage==
While the ABLLS-R is most commonly used on children with developmental disabilities and delays (including [[autism]]), it can be used for anyone who may be lacking in basic communication or life skills.

It assesses the strengths and weaknesses of an individual in each of the 25 skill sets. Each skill set is broken down into multiple skills, ordered by typical development or complexity. So, a skill of F1 (Requests by indicating) is a simpler skill than F12 (Requesting Help). ''Usually'', lower level skills are needed before proceeding to teach higher skills. However, many individuals display [[splinter skill]]s that are above their practical level.

The ABLLS-R is conducted via observation of the child's behavior in each skill area. The instructor will provide a stimulus to the child (verbal, hand-over-hand, non-verbal, etc.), and, depending on what the child does (the behavior), determines their skill-level. Some skills are difficult or time-consuming to test; instructors frequently accept anecdotal evidence from parents and other instructors as to a child's ability at a given skill-level.

==Sections==
The ABLLS-R is split into 25 functional areas, each corresponding to a letter in the alphabet. The sections between the ABLLS and ABLLS-R are similar; it is mostly the skills that vary in number and scope.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The following is a very brief list of advantages and disadvantages to using the ABLLS-R assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Valentino, Amber, M.A. &amp; Flake, Lisa, BCABA (2007). ABA/VB 6 Session Training Series.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
* Can be conducted by most people with a minimal understanding of [[applied behavior analysis]].
* Addresses basic language, academic, self-help, classroom, and gross and fine motor skill sets.
* Provides quick review for parents and educators to identify skill level of student
* Easy for parents and teachers to communicate about the student’s educational programming
* Provides data to indicate the skill level of normal development

===Disadvantages===
* Skill lists are not exhaustive (544 skills).
* Skills are mostly in order of childhood development, but every child learns differently.
* Not a fully standardized assessment

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1837">'''Brand aversion''' is an antonym of [[brand loyalty]]. It is a distrust or a dislike of products from a particular [[brand]] on the basis of past experiences with that brand and its products, similar to [[taste aversion]].

Brand aversion can be the effect of obtrusive [[marketing]] strategies, bad press, a mass [[product recall]], or other poor [[product launch]]es.

Psychologically, the reasons for brand aversion have been explained by the attachment-aversion model using the same three dimensions ("'''3 E'''s") that characterize a product:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://msbfile03.usc.edu/digitalmeasures/choong/intellcont/AA%20Model%20of%20Customer_Brand_Relationships%20Jan_09_2013-2.docx|title=Attachment-aversion (AA) model of customer-brand relationships |journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology |author1=Whan Park |author2=Andreas B.

#enticing/annoying the self
#enabling/disabling the self and
#enriching/impoverishing the self (benefits/liabilities).
The more annoying/disabling/impoverishing a brand "feels", the more aversion will be produced and vice versa. As is the case with all brands, the conceived qualities need neither correspond to real assets nor shortcomings.

{{Contains Indic text}}

In [[Buddhism]], '''buddhahood''' ({{lang-sa|buddhatva}}; {{lang-pi|buddhatta}} or {{lang|pi|buddhabhāva|italic=no}}; Chinese: 佛果) is the condition or rank of a [[Buddha (title)|buddha]] "awakened one".&lt;ref&gt;buddhatva, बुद्धत्व. [http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=buddhatva&amp;trans=%E7%BF%BB%E8%A8%B3&amp;direction=AU Spoken Sanskrit Dictionary]. (accessed: January 10, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of [[Mahayana]]'s [[bodhisattva]] path is Samyaksambuddhahood, so that one may benefit all sentient beings by teaching them the path of cessation of ''[[dukkha]]''.&lt;ref name=gethin1998p224&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gethin|first1=Rupert|title=The foundations of Buddhism|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [England]|isbn=0-19-289223-1|pages=224–234|edition=1. publ. paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahayana theory contrasts this with the goal of the [[Theravada]] path, where the goal is individual [[arhat]]ship.&lt;ref name=gethin1998p224/&gt;

==Explanation of the term ''Buddha''==
{{Buddhism}}
In [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]], ''Buddha'' refers to one who has become [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awake]] through their own efforts and insight, without a teacher to point out the [[dharma]] (Sanskrit; Pali ''dhamma''; "right way of living"). A samyaksambuddha teaches the dharma to others after his awakening. A [[pratyekabuddha]] also reaches Nirvana through his own efforts, but does not teach the dharma to others. An [[arhat]] needs to follow the teaching of a Buddha to attain Nirvana, but can also preach the dharma after attaining Nirvana.&lt;ref name="Snelling, John 1987 Page 81"&gt;Snelling, John (1987), ''The Buddhist handbook. A Complete Guide to Buddhist Teaching and Practice''. London: Century Paperbacks. Page 81&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance the term buddha is also used in Theravada to refer to all who attain [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]], using the term [[Sāvakabuddha]] to designate an arhat, someone who depends on the teachings of a Buddha to attain Nirvana.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''Udana Commentary''. Translation Peter Masefield, volume I, 1994. Pali Text Society. page 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In this broader sense it is equivalent to the arhat.

Buddhahood is the state of an awakened being, who having found the path of cessation of [[dukkha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gethin|first1=Rupert|title=The foundations of Buddhism|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [England]|isbn=0-19-289223-1|page=32|edition=1. publ. paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("suffering", as created by attachment to desires and distorted perception and thinking) is in the state of "No-more-Learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damien Keown |author2=Charles S. Prebish |title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFpcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-98588-1|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rinpoche Karma-raṅ-byuṅ-kun-khyab-phrin-las|title=The Dharma: That Illuminates All Beings Impartially Like the Light of the Sun and Moon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4wVW91BLAYC |year=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-156-1|pages=32–33}}; Quote: "There are various ways of examining the Complete Path. For example, we can speak of Five Paths constituting its different levels: the Path of Accumulation, the Path of Application, the Path of Seeing, the Path of Meditation and the Path of No More Learning, or Buddhahood."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E. Buswell|author2=Robert M. Gimello|title=Paths to liberation: the Mārga and its transformations in Buddhist thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hu0oIf0n87IC |year=1990|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1253-9|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a broad spectrum of opinion on the universality and method of attainment of Buddhahood, depending on [[Gautama Buddha]]'s teachings that a school of Buddhism emphasizes. The level to which this manifestation requires [[ascetic]] practices varies from none at all to an absolute requirement, dependent on doctrine. Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the [[bodhisattva]] ideal instead of the Arhat.

The Tathagatagarba and [[Buddha-nature]] doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism consider Buddhahood to be a universal and innate property of absolute wisdom. This wisdom is revealed in a person's current lifetime through Buddhist practice, without any specific relinquishment of pleasures or "earthly desires".

Buddhists do not consider Gautama to have been the only Buddha. The [[Pāli Canon]] refers to many previous ones (see [[list of the named Buddhas]]), while the Mahayana tradition additionally has many Buddhas of celestial origin (see [[Amitābha]] or [[Vairocana]] as examples, for lists of many thousands of Buddha names (see ''[[Taishō Tripiṭaka]]'' numbers 439–448).

==Nature of the Buddha==
{{further|Buddhology}}
The various Buddhist schools hold some varying interpretations on the nature of Buddha (see below).

===Attainments===
[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|The Buddha, in [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist style]], first-second century, [[Gandhara]] (now Pakistan). ([[Standing Buddha]]).]]
All Buddhist traditions hold that a Buddha is fully awakened and has completely purified his mind of the [[three poisons]] of [[taṇhā|craving]], [[Dvesha_(Buddhism)|aversion]] and [[avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]]. A Buddha is no longer bound by [[saṃsāra]], and has ended the [[Dukkha|suffering]] which unawakened people experience in life.

Most schools of Buddhism have also held that the Buddha was [[omniscience|omniscient]]. However, the early texts contain explicit repudiations of making this claim of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. K. Warder]], ''Indian Buddhism.'' Third edition published by Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2000, pages 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalupahana|first=David|authorlink=David Kalupahana|title=A History of Buddhist Philosophy: Continuities and Discontinuities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlDArya3YvcC&amp;pg=PA43|year=1992|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1402-1|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ten characteristics of a Buddha===
Some Buddhists meditate on (or contemplate) the Buddha as having ten characteristics (Ch./Jp. 十號). These characteristics are frequently mentioned in the Pāli Canon as well as Mahayana teachings, and are chanted daily in many Buddhist monasteries:
#Thus gone, thus come (Skt: ''{{IAST|[[tathāgata]]}}'')
#Worthy one (Skt: ''[[arhat]]'')
#Perfectly self-enlightened (Skt: ''{{IAST|samyak-saṃbuddha}}'')
#Perfected in knowledge and conduct (Skt: ''{{IAST|vidyā-caraṇa-saṃpanna}}'' )
#Well gone (Skt: ''sugata'')
#Knower of the world (Skt: ''lokavida'')
#Unsurpassed (Skt: ''anuttara'')
#Leader of persons to be tamed (Skt: ''{{IAST|puruṣa-damya-sārathi}}'')
#Teacher of the gods and humans (Skt: ''{{IAST|śāsta deva-manuṣyāṇaṃ}}'')
#The Blessed One or fortunate one (Skt: ''bhagavat'')&lt;ref&gt;Japanese-English Buddhist Dictionary (Daitō shuppansha) 147a/163&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenth epithet is sometimes listed as "The World Honored Enlightened One" (Skt. ''Buddha-Lokanatha'') or "The Blessed Enlightened One" (Skt. ''Buddha-Bhagavan'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tientai.net/teachings/dharma/buddha/10titles.htm], also see [[Thomas Cleary]] and [[J. C. Cleary]] ''The Blue Cliff Record'', page 553.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddha as a supreme human===
In the Pāli Canon, Gautama Buddha is known as being a "teacher of the gods and humans", superior to both the gods and humans in the sense of having [[nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]] or the greatest bliss, whereas the [[deva (Buddhism)|devas]], or gods, are still subject to anger, fear and sorrow.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

In the Madhupindika Sutta (MN 18),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.018.than.html Majhima Nikaya 18 Madhupindika Sutta: The Ball of Honey]&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha is described in powerful terms as the Lord of the Dhamma (Pali: Dhammasami, skt.: Dharma Swami) and the bestower of immortality (Pali: Amatassadata).

Similarly, in the ''Anuradha Sutta'' (SN 44.2)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.002.than.html Sutta Nikaya 44.2 Anuradha Sutta: To Anuradha]&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha is described as 
{{quote|the Tathagata—the supreme man, the superlative man, attainer of the superlative attainment.&lt;br/&gt;[Buddha is asked about what happens to the Tathagatha after death of the physical body. Buddha replies],&lt;br/&gt;"And so, Anuradha—when you can't pin down the Tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life—is it proper for you to declare, 'Friends, the Tathagata—the supreme man, the superlative man, attainer of the superlative attainment—being described, is described otherwise than with these four positions: The Tathagata exists after death, does not exist after death, both does &amp; does not exist after death, neither exists nor does not exist after death'?}}

In the Vakkali Sutta (SN 22.87) Buddha identifies himself with the Dhamma:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.087x.wlsh.html Sutta Nikaya 22.87 Vakkali Sutta: Vakkali]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|O Vakkali, whoever sees the Dhamma, sees me [the Buddha]}}

Another reference from the [[Aggañña Sutta]] of the [[Digha Nikaya]], says to his disciple Vasettha:
{{quote|O Vasettha! The Word of Dhammakaya is indeed the name of the Tathagata}}

[[Shravasti Dhammika]], a Theravada monk, writes:

{{quote|In the centuries after his final Nibbāna it sometimes got to the stage that the legends and myths obscured the very real human being behind them and the Buddha came to be looked upon as a god. Actually, the Buddha was a human being, not a 'mere human being' as is sometimes said but a special class of human called a 'complete person' (mahāparisa). Such complete persons are born no different from others and indeed they physically remain quite ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhammika|first=Shravasti|authorlink=Shravasti Dhammika|title=The Buddha and His Disciples|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|year=2005|page=16|ISBN=9789552402807}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sangharakshita]] also states that "The first thing we have to understand - and this is very important - is that the Buddha is a human being. But a special kind of human being, in fact the highest kind, so far as we know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sangharakshita|authorlink=Sangharakshita|title=A Guide to the Buddhist Path|publisher=Windhorse Publications|year=1996|page=45|ISBN=9781899579044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddha as "just a human"===

When asked whether he was a [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]] or a human, he replied that he had eliminated the deep-rooted unconscious traits that would make him either one, and should instead be called a Buddha; one who had grown up in the world but had now gone beyond it, as a lotus grows from the water but blossoms above it, unsoiled.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History, and Practices.'' Cambridge University Press, 1990, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Skilton writes that the Buddha was never historically regarded by Buddhist traditions as being merely human:&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' 2004. pp. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is important to stress that, despite modern Theravada teachings to the contrary (often a sop to skeptical Western pupils), he was never seen as being merely human. For instance, he is often described as having the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks or signs of a ''mahāpuruṣa'', "superman"; the Buddha himself denied that he was either a man or a [[Deva (Buddhism)|god]]; and in the ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta|Mahāparinibbāna Sutta]]'' he states that he could live for an [[Kalpa (aeon)|aeon]] were he asked to do so.}}

However, [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]], a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] in the [[Zen]] tradition, states that "Buddha was not a god. He was a human being like you and me, and he suffered just as we do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nhất Hạnh|first=Thích|authorlink=Thích Nhất Hạnh|title=The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching|publisher=[[Broadway Books]]|year=1999|page=3|ISBN=0-7679-0369-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Maguire writes that Buddha is inspirational based on his humanness.

{{quote|A fundamental part of Buddhism's appeal to billions of people over the past two and a half millennia is the fact that the central figure, commonly referred to by the title "Buddha", was not a god, or a special kind of spiritual being, or even a prophet or an emissary of one. On the contrary, he was a human being like the rest of us who quite simply woke up to full aliveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maguire|first=Jack|title=Essential Buddhism|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=2013|page=2|ISBN=9781476761961}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Mahāsāṃghika supramundane Buddha===
In the early Buddhist schools, the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] branch regarded the buddhas as being characterized primarily by their supramundane nature. The Mahāsāṃghikas advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and the fallibility of arhats.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1b"&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 48 special theses attributed by the ''Samayabhedoparacanacakra'' to the Mahāsāṃghika [[Ekavyāvahārika]], [[Lokottaravāda]], and the [[Kukkuṭika]], 20 points concern the supramundane nature of buddhas and bodhisattvas.&lt;ref&gt;Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' 2008. p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Samayabhedoparacanacakra'', these four groups held that the Buddha is able to know all dharmas in a single moment of the mind.&lt;ref name="Yao, Zhihua 2005. p. 11"&gt;Yao, Zhihua. ''The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition.'' 2005. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Yao Zhihua writes:&lt;ref name="Yao, Zhihua 2005. p. 11"/&gt;

{{quote|In their view, the Buddha is equipped with the following supernatural qualities: transcendence (''lokottara''), lack of defilements, all of his utterances [[Dharmachakra|preaching his teaching]], expounding all his teachings in a single utterance, all of his sayings being true, his physical body being limitless, his power (''prabhāva'') being limitless, the length of his life being limitless, never tiring of enlightening sentient beings and awakening pure faith in them, having no sleep or dreams, no pause in answering a question, and always in meditation (''[[Samadhi|samādhi]]'').}}

A doctrine ascribed to the Mahāsāṃghikas is, "The power of the tathāgatas is unlimited, and the life of the buddhas is unlimited."&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, Kenneth. ''The Dawn of Chinese Pure Land Buddhist Doctrine.'' 1990. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; According to Guang Xing, two main aspects of the Buddha can be seen in Mahāsāṃghika teachings: the true Buddha who is omniscient and omnipotent, and the manifested forms through which he liberates sentient beings through skillful means.&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; For the Mahāsaṃghikas, the historical Gautama Buddha was one of these transformation bodies (Skt. ''[[trikaya|nirmāṇakāya]]''), while the essential real Buddha is equated with the [[Dharmakāya]].&lt;ref&gt;Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' 2008. pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;

As in Mahāyāna traditions, the Mahāsāṃghikas held the doctrine of the existence of many contemporaneous buddhas throughout the ten directions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated65"&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mahāsāṃghika ''Lokānuvartana Sūtra'', it is stated, "The Buddha knows all the dharmas of the countless buddhas of the ten directions."&lt;ref name="autogenerated65"/&gt; It is also stated, "All buddhas have one body, the body of the Dharma."&lt;ref name="autogenerated65"/&gt; The concept of many bodhisattvas simultaneously working toward buddhahood is also found among the Mahāsāṃghika tradition, and further evidence of this is given in the ''Samayabhedoparacanacakra'', which describes the doctrines of the Mahāsāṃghikas.&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions of the Buddha in art==
{{main|Buddharupa}}
[[File:ShwedagonIMG 7662.JPG|thumb|[[Buddharupa|Buddha statues]] at [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]]]
Buddhas are frequently represented in the form of statues and paintings. Commonly seen designs include:
* The Seated Buddha
* The Reclining Buddha
* The Standing Buddha
*''Hotei'' or ''[[Budai]]'', the obese Laughing Buddha, usually seen in [[China]] (This figure is believed to be a representation of a medieval Chinese monk who is associated with [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha, and is therefore technically not a Buddha image.)
* the Emaciated Buddha, which shows Siddhartha Gautama during his extreme ascetic practice of starvation.

The Buddha statue shown calling for rain is a pose common in [[Lao Buddhist sculpture|Laos]].

===Markings===
Most depictions of Buddha contain a certain number of ''markings'', which are considered the signs of his enlightenment. These signs vary regionally, but two are common:

*a protuberance on the top of the head (denoting superb mental acuity)
*long earlobes (denoting superb perception)

In the Pāli Canon, there is frequent mention of a list of thirty-two [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]].

===Hand-gestures===
The poses and hand-gestures of these statues, known respectively as [[asana]]s and [[mudra]]s, are significant to their overall meaning. The popularity of any particular mudra or asana tends to be region-specific, such as the ''[[Vajra]]'' (or ''Chi Ken-in'') mudra, which is popular in [[Japan]] and [[Korean Buddhist sculpture|Korea]] but rarely seen in [[India]]. Others are more common; for example, the ''Varada'' (Wish Granting) mudra is common among standing statues of the Buddha, particularly when coupled with the ''Abhaya'' (Fearlessness and Protection) mudra.

==Names of the Buddha==
[[Aśvaghoṣa]] in his ''[[Buddhacarita]]'' gives a long list of names for the Buddha:
{{quote|Buddha, Self-existent, Lord of Law (Dharmaraja), Nayaka, Vinayaka, Caravan Leader, Jina (Victorious One), the Master-giver of Dharma, The Teacher, Master of the Dharma, the Lord of the World, the consoler, the loving-regarder [cf.

In his commentary to the ''[[Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]'', [[Hsuan Hua]] tells the following fable: 
{{quote|Originally every Buddha had ten thousand names. In time these ten thousand names were reduced to one thousand because people got confused trying to remember them all. For a while every Buddha had a thousand names, but people still couldn’t remember so many, so they were again reduced to one hundred names. Every Buddha had a hundred different names and living beings had a hard time remembering them, so they were shortened again to ten.&lt;ref&gt;From the Chapter on "The General Explanation of the Title", ''The Surangama Sutra'', English translation by the Buddhist Text Translation Society.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''calculation of glass properties''' ('''glass modeling''') is used to predict [[glass]] properties of interest or glass behavior under certain conditions (e.g., during production) without experimental investigation, based on past data and experience, with the intention to save time, material, financial, and environmental resources, or to gain scientific insight. It was first practised at the end of the 19th century by A. Winkelmann and [[Otto Schott|O. Schott]]. The combination of several glass models together with other relevant functions can be used for [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[six sigma]] procedures. In the form of [[statistical analysis]] glass modeling can aid with [[accreditation]] of new data, experimental procedures, and measurement institutions (glass laboratories).

==History==
Historically, the calculation of glass properties is directly related to the founding of glass [[science]]. At the end of the 19th century the physicist [[Ernst Abbe]] developed equations that allow calculating the design of optimized optical [[microscope]]s in [[Jena]], [[Germany]], stimulated by co-operation with the optical workshop of [[Carl Zeiss]]. Before Ernst Abbe's time the building of [[microscope]]s was mainly a work of art and experienced craftsmanship, resulting in very expensive optical [[microscope]]s with variable quality. Now Ernst Abbe knew exactly how to construct an excellent microscope, but unfortunately, the required [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] and [[Prism (optics)|prisms]] with specific ratios of [[refractive index]] and [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] did not exist. Ernst Abbe was not able to find answers to his needs from glass artists and engineers; glass making was not based on science at this time.&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite book |author=Vogel, Werner |title=Glass chemistry |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |year=1994 |isbn=3-540-57572-3 |edition=2nd revised }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879 the young glass engineer [[Otto Schott]] sent Abbe glass samples with a special composition ([[lithium]] silicate glass) that he had prepared himself and that he hoped to show special [[optics|optical]] properties. Following measurements by Ernst Abbe, Schott's glass samples did not have the desired properties, and they were also not as homogeneous as desired. Nevertheless, Ernst Abbe invited Otto Schott to work on the problem further and to evaluate all possible glass components systematically. Finally, Schott succeeded in producing homogeneous glass samples, and he invented [[borosilicate glass]] with the optical properties Abbe needed.&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt; These inventions gave rise to the well-known companies [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] and [[Schott Glass]] (see also [[Timeline of microscope technology]]). Systematic glass research was born. In 1908, Eugene Sullivan founded glass research also in the United States ([[Corning (city), New York|Corning]], [[New York (state)|New York]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.corning.com/inside_corning/our_heritage.aspx# |title=Eugene Sullivan and Corning Glass Works |access-date=2007-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013152045/http://corning.com/inside_corning/our_heritage.aspx# |archive-date=2007-10-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of glass research it was most important to know the relation between the glass composition and its properties. For this purpose Otto Schott introduced the '''additivity principle''' in several publications for calculation of glass properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Winkelmann A. |author2=Schott O. |title=Über die Elastizität und über die Druckfestigkeit verschiedener neuer Gläser in ihrer Abhängigkeit von der chemischen Zusammensetzung |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |volume=51 |pages=697 |year=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Winkelmann A. |author2=Schott O. |title=Über thermische Widerstandscoefficienten verschiedener Gläser in ihrer Abhängigkeit von der chemischen Zusammensetzung |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |volume=51 |issue= |pages=730 |year=1894 |doi=10.1002/andp.18942870407|bibcode = 1894AnP...287..730W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Winkelmann A. |author2=Schott O. |title=Über die specifischen Wärmen verschieden zusammengesetzter Gläser |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |volume=49 |page=401 |year=1893 |doi=10.1002/andp.18932850702|bibcode = 1893AnP...285..401W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle implies that the relation between the glass composition and a specific property is linear to all glass component concentrations, assuming an [[ideal mixture]], with ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' representing specific glass component concentrations and related coefficients respectively in the equation below. The additivity principle is a simplification and only valid within narrow composition ranges as seen in the displayed diagrams for the refractive index and the viscosity. Nevertheless, the application of the additivity principle lead the way to many of Schott’s inventions, including optical glasses, glasses with low thermal expansion for cooking and laboratory ware ([[borosilicate glass|Duran]]), and glasses with reduced freezing point depression for mercury [[thermometer]]s. Subsequently, English&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=English S. |title=The effect of composition on the viscosity of glass. Part II |journal=J. Soc.

Schott and many scientists and engineers afterwards applied the additivity principle to experimental data measured in their own laboratory within sufficiently narrow composition ranges ('''local glass models'''). This is most convenient because disagreements between laboratories and non-linear glass component interactions do not need to be considered. In the course of several decades of systematic glass research thousands of [[glass]] compositions were studied, resulting in millions of published glass properties, collected in [[glass databases]]. This huge pool of experimental data was not investigated as a whole, until Bottinga,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2475/ajs.272.5.438 |author1=Bottinga Y. |author2=Weill D.F. |title=The viscosity of magmatic silicate liquids: a model for calculation |journal=Am.

In contrast to the models by Schott the global models consider many independent data sources, making the model estimates more reliable. In addition, global models can reveal and quantify ''non-additive'' influences of certain glass component combinations on the properties, such as the ''mixed-alkali effect'' as seen in the adjacent diagram, or the ''boron anomaly''. Global models also reflect interesting developments of glass property measurement [[accuracy]], e.g., a decreasing accuracy of experimental data in modern scientific literature for some glass properties, shown in the diagram. They can be used for accreditation of new data, experimental procedures, and measurement institutions (glass laboratories). In the following sections (except melting enthalpy) ''[[empirical]]'' modeling techniques are presented, which seem to be a successful way for handling huge amounts of experimental data. The resulting models are applied in contemporary engineering and research for the calculation of glass properties.

Non-empirical (''[[deductive]]'') glass models exist.&lt;ref&gt;Milos B. Volf: "Mathematical Approach to Glass" Glass Science and Technology, vol. 9, Elsevier, 1988, {{ISBN|0-444-98951-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often not created to obtain reliable glass property predictions in the first place (except melting enthalpy), but to establish relations among several properties (e.g. [[atomic radius]], [[atomic mass]], [[Chemical bond|chemical bond strength and angles]], [[Valence (chemistry)|chemical valency]], [[heat capacity]]) to gain scientific insight. In future, the investigation of property relations in deductive models may ultimately lead to reliable predictions for all desired properties, provided the property relations are well understood and all required experimental data are available.

==Methods==
Glass properties and glass behavior during production can be calculated through [[statistical analysis]] of [[glass databases]] such as GE-SYSTEM&lt;ref name="GE-SYSTEM"&gt;[http://www.smartdata.cn/en/ges2010/index.html GE-SYSTEM]&lt;/ref&gt;
SciGlass&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciglass.info/ SciGlass] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016044859/http://www.sciglass.info/ |date=2007-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Interglad,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newglass.jp/interglad_n/gaiyo/info_e.html Interglad]&lt;/ref&gt; 
sometimes combined with the [[finite element method]]. For estimating the melting enthalpy thermodynamic databases are used.

===Linear regression===
[[Image:refractive index SiO2 Na2O.gif|250px|thumb|Refractive index in the system SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. [[dummy variable (statistics)|Dummy variables]] can be used to quantify systematic differences of whole dataseries from one investigator.&lt;ref name=errors/&gt;]]

If the desired glass property is not related to [[crystallization]] (e.g., [[liquidus temperature]]) or [[phase separation]], [[linear regression]] can be applied using common [[polynomial]] functions up to the third degree. Below is an example equation of the second degree. The ''C''-values are the glass component concentrations like Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or CaO in percent or other fractions, the ''b''-values are coefficients, and ''n'' is the total number of glass components. The glass main component [[silica]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is excluded in the equation below because of over-parametrization due to the constraint that all components sum up to 100%. Many terms in the equation below can be neglected based on [[correlation]] and [[Statistical significance|significance]] analysis. Systematic errors such as seen in the picture are quantified by [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variables]]. Further details and examples are available in an online tutorial by Fluegel.&lt;ref&gt;A. Fluegel: [http://glassproperties.com/principle/Statistics_Glass_2007.pdf Statistical Regression Modeling of Glass Properties - A Tutorial]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glass melting enthalpy===
The glass melting enthalpy reflects the amount of energy needed to convert the mix of raw materials ([[glass batch|batch]]) to a melt glass. It depends on the batch and glass compositions, on the efficiency of the furnace and heat regeneration systems, the average residence time of the glass in the furnace, and many other factors. A pioneering article about the subject was written by Carl Kröger in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kröger, Carl |title=Theoretischer Wärmebedarf der Glasschmelzprozesse (Theoretical heat demand of glass melting processes) |journal=Glastechnische Berichte |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=202–14 |year=1953 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finite element method===
For modeling of the glass flow in a glass melting furnace the [[finite element method]] is applied commercially,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsl.cz/en/products/furnace-design.html Glass Service, Furnace Design]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brochure: [http://www.fluent.com/solutions/brochures/glass.pdf Flow modeling software for the glass industry]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Fluent Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; based on data or models for [[viscosity]], [[density]], [[thermal conductivity]], [[heat capacity]], absorption spectra, and other relevant properties of the glass melt. The finite element method may also be applied to glass forming processes.

===Optimization===
It is often required to [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimize]] several glass properties simultaneously, including production costs.
&lt;ref name="GE-SYSTEM"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://glassproperties.com/optimization/ Glass property optimization]&lt;/ref&gt; This can be performed, e.g., by [[simplex search]], or in a spreadsheet as follows:
# Listing of the desired properties;
# Entering of models for the reliable calculation of properties based on the glass composition, including a formula for estimating the production costs;
# Calculation of the squares of the differences (errors) between desired and calculated properties;
# Reduction of the sum of square errors using the Solver option&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solver.com/suppstdsolver.htm Excel Solver]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Microsoft Excel]] with the glass components as variables. Other software (e.g. Microcal [[Origin (data analysis software)|Origin]]) can also be used to perform these [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimizations]].
It is possible to weight the desired properties differently. Basic information about the principle can be found in an article by Huff ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1973.tb12356.x|title=Computerized Prediction of Glass Compositions from Properties|year=1973|last1=Huff|first1=N. T.|last2=Call|first2=A. D.|journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society|volume=56|pages=55|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of several glass models together with further relevant technological and financial functions can be used in [[six sigma]] optimization.

Equivalently (for [[regular space|regular]] [[T1 space|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; spaces]] but not in general), a space is cosmic if and only if it has a [[countable]] network; namely a [[countable set|countable]] collection of [[subset]]s of the space such that any [[open set]] is the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of a subcollection of these sets.

Cosmic spaces have several interesting properties. There are a number of unsolved problems about them.

==Examples and properties==

* Any open subset of a cosmic space is cosmic since open subsets of separable spaces are separable.

It is unknown as to whether ''X'' is cosmic if:

[[Image:Cycle of Abuse.png|thumb|400px|The four phases of the Cycle of Abuse]]
The '''cycle of abuse''' is a [[social cycle theory]] developed in 1979 by [[Lenore E. Walker]] to explain patterns of behavior in an [[abusive]] relationship.

==Overview==
[[Lenore E. Walker]] interviewed 1,500 women who had been subject to [[domestic violence]] and found that there was a similar pattern of abuse, called the "cycle of abuse".&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie S. Fisher; Steven P. Lab. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8kHrWPLLX54C&amp;pg=PA257 Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention]''. SAGE Publications; 2 February 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-6047-2}}. p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Walker proposed that the cycle of abuse described the controlling [[patriarchal]] behavior of men who felt entitled to abuse their wives to maintain control over them. Her terms "the battering cycle" and "battered woman syndrome" has since been largely eclipsed by "cycle of abuse" and "[[battered person syndrome]]", respectively, for many reasons: to maintain objectivity; because the cycle of abuse doesn't always lead to physical abuse; because symptoms of the syndrome have been observed in men and women, and are not confined to marriage and dating. Similarly, Dutton (1994) writes, "The prevalence of violence in homosexual relationships, which also appear to go through abuse cycles is hard to explain in terms of men dominating women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dutton |first=Donald G. |year=1994 |title=Patriarchy And Wife Assault: The Ecological Fallacy |journal=Violence and Victims |volume=9 |number=2 |pages=167–182 |url=http://lab.drdondutton.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/DUTTON.-1994.-PATRIARCHY-AND-WIFE-ASSAULT-THE-ECOLOGICAL-FALLACY..pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229141744/http://lab.drdondutton.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/DUTTON.-1994.-PATRIARCHY-AND-WIFE-ASSAULT-THE-ECOLOGICAL-FALLACY..pdf |archivedate=2014-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cycle of abuse concept is widely used in [[domestic violence]] programs, particularly in the United States. Critics have argued the theory is flawed as it does not apply as universally as Walker suggested, does not accurately or completely describe all abusive relationships, and may emphasize ideological presumptions rather than empirical data.&lt;ref name="Dutton&amp;Golant"&gt;Dutton, Donald G. and Susan Golant. 1997. The Batterer: A Psychological Profile. {{ISBN|0465033881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phases==
The cycle usually goes in the following order, and will repeat until the conflict is stopped, usually by the survivor entirely abandoning the relationship&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft, Lundy. ''Why does he do that? Inside the minds of angry and controlling men'' Berkley Publishing Group 2002 {{ISBN|0-399-14844-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or some form of intervention.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9"&gt;Willis C. Newman; Esmeralda Newman. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c1_9nzCi4W0C&amp;pg=PA9 Domestic Violence: Causes and Cures and Anger Management]''. Willis Newman; 12 May 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-4528-4323-0}}. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle can occur hundreds of times in an abusive relationship, the total cycle taking anywhere from a few hours, to a year or more to complete. However, the length of the cycle usually diminishes over time so that the "reconciliation" and "calm" stages may disappear,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} violence becomes more intense and the cycles become more frequent.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt;

===1: Tension building===
Stress builds from the pressures of daily life, like conflict over children, marital issues, misunderstandings, or other family conflicts. It also builds as the result of illness, legal or financial problems, unemployment, or catastrophic events, like floods, rape or war.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt; During this period, the abuser feels ignored, threatened, annoyed or wronged. The feeling lasts on average several minutes to hours, it may last as much as several months.&lt;ref name="Johnson p. 31"&gt;Scott Allen Johnson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xH9ucrMFdC8C&amp;pg=PA31 Physical Abusers and Sexual Offenders: Forensic and Clinical Strategies]''. CRC Press; 13 July 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-8493-7259-9}}. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent violence, the victim may try to reduce the tension by becoming compliant and nurturing. Or, to get the abuse over with, prepare for the violence or lessen the degree of injury, the victim may provoke the batterer. "However, at no time is the batterer justified in engaging in violent or abusive behavior," said Scott Allen Johnson, author of ''Physical Abusers and Sexual Offenders''.&lt;ref name="Johnson p. 31" /&gt;

===2: Acute violence===
Characterized by outbursts of violent, abusive incidents which may be preceded by [[verbal abuse]]&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt; and include [[psychological abuse]].&lt;ref name="Johnson p. 31" /&gt; During this stage the abuser attempts to dominate their partner (survivor) with the use of domestic violence.

In [[intimate partner violence]], children are negatively affected by having witnessed the violence and the partner's relationship degrades as well. The release of energy reduces the tension, and the abuser may feel or express that the victim "had it coming" to them.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt;

===3: Reconciliation/honeymoon===
The perpetrator may begin to feel remorse, guilty feelings, or fear that their partner will leave or call the police. The victim feels pain, fear, humiliation, disrespect, confusion, and may mistakenly feel responsible.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt;

Characterized by affection, apology, or, alternatively, ignoring the incident, this phase marks an apparent end of violence, with assurances that it will never happen again, or that the abuser will do their best to change. During this stage the abuser may feel or claim to feel overwhelming remorse and sadness. Some abusers walk away from the situation with little comment, but most will eventually [[Love bombing|shower the survivor with love and affection]]. The abuser may use [[Victim playing|self-harm or threats of suicide to gain sympathy]] and/or prevent the survivor from leaving the relationship. Abusers are frequently so convincing, and survivors so eager for the relationship to improve, that survivors (who are often worn down and confused by longstanding abuse) stay in the relationship.&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brewster, Susan ''Helping her get free'' Seal Press 2006 {{ISBN|1-58005-167-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===4: Calm===
During this phase (which is often considered an element of the honeymoon/reconciliation phase), the relationship is relatively calm and peaceable. During this period the abuser may agree to engage in counseling, ask for forgiveness, and create a normal atmosphere. In intimate partner relationships, the perpetrator may buy presents or the couple may engage in passionate sex.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt; Over time, the batterer's apologies and requests for forgiveness become less sincere and are generally stated to prevent separation or intervention.&lt;ref name="Johnson p. 31" /&gt; However, interpersonal difficulties will inevitably arise, leading again to the tension building phase.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt; The effect of the continual cycle may include loss of love, contempt, distress, and/or physical disability. Intimate partners may separate, divorce or, at the extreme, someone may be killed.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 9" /&gt;

==Critiques==
Walker's cycle of abuse theory was regarded as a revolutionary and important concept in the study of abuse and interpersonal violence,&lt;ref name="Dutton&amp;Golant"/&gt; which is a useful model, but may be simplistic. For instance, Scott Allen Johnson developed a 14-stage cycle that broke down the tension-building, acting-out and calm stages further. For instance, there are six stages in the "escalation" or tension building stage, which includes triggers, the victim feeling victimized, angry and depressed, isolation and revenge planning. These lead up to the assault by acting out the revenge plan, self-destructive behavior, victim grooming and the actual physical and/or sexual assault. This is followed by a sense of relief, fear of consequences, distraction, and rationalization of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Allen Johnson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xH9ucrMFdC8C&amp;pg=PA33 Physical Abusers and Sexual Offenders: Forensic and Clinical Strategies]''. CRC Press; 13 July 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-8493-7259-9}}. p. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Dutton and Susan Golant agree that Walker's cycle of abuse accurately describes all cyclically abusive relationships they studied. Nonetheless, they also note that her initial research was based almost entirely on [[anecdotal]] data from a rather small set of women who were in violent relationships.&lt;ref name="Dutton&amp;Golant"/&gt; Walker herself wrote, "These women were not randomly selected and they cannot be considered a legitimate [[data base]] from which to make specific generalizations."&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, Lenore E. (1979) ''The Battered Woman''. New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cycle of Abuse'''. In some areas of psychological research, violence is thought rarely to be only a one-time event. When abuse occurs in a relationship, it is said that the odds of re-occurrence increase dramatically.

'''Phase 1''': In this phase, tension is mounting within a home or situation. This is when minor conflicts occur and threats of violence may escalate.   The duration of this phase may last from a few hours to sometimes months.

'''Phase 2''': In this phase, the actual hands on abuse often occurs. The abuser may slap, kick, choke, or even commit worse bodily harm to the victim. The use of sexual acts or the use of weapons may occur. It is in this phase that there are usually no witnesses and there is little the victim can do to stop the violence.

'''Phase 3:''' The is often called the apology phase or the "Honeymoon" phase. The abuser may apologize and show great signs of remorse and beg for forgiveness. Often, the abuser will present gifts and tokens so that the victim will excuse the abuse. The abuser may even promise to seek treatment for the behavior and promise it will never happen again.

'''Phase 4''': Phase 1 starts all over again in a vicious cycle. Unfortunately, the abuse begins again and most often the abuser is more violent and terrorizing in his/her acts. The victim is often injured to the point of hospitalization or worse and often can not find an escape out of the situation.

This cycle is seen as 'never ending', unless 'the victim' finds a way to physically leave the situation.

Criticisms have been raised about the methodological limitations of the research from which this theory arises. While the theory 'fits' the anecdotal experience of many partners in abusive relationships, there are questions about its universal and determinist application as a prognostic tool. Coverage of this theory in the media and in popular self-help books is said to have distorted public perception of the complexity &amp; diversity of relationship breakdown, and also contributed to the design of unsatisfactory interventions by the state in relationships.--&gt;

The ''' Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS)''' is a structured interview for psychiatric disorders designed by researchers from the [[National Institute of Mental Health]], first published in 1991. Although most of the diagnoses were based on [[DSM-III-R]] criteria, the instrument was also able to generate diagnoses for certain disorders in other systems including [[DSM-IV]], [[Research Diagnostic Criteria]], [[ICD-10]] and [[Feighner Criteria]]. This was possible because of the instrument records symptoms in sufficient detail to allow different criteria to be applied. 
&lt;ref name="DIGS"&gt;Nurnberger JI, Blehar MC, Kaufmann CA et al (1994).[http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=496822 Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS)] Archives of General Psychiatry, vol. 51, pp. 849-59 {{PMID|7944874}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The DIGS interview has gone through a number of revisions since being published. The latest version is DIGS 4.0/BP which was published in 2005. All DIGS versions are available to download from the NIMH Center for Collaborative Genomic Studies on Mental Disorders

'''Drishti-srishti-vada ''' ([[Sanskrit]]: दृष्टिसृष्टिवाद) or 'the doctrine of creation through perception', is an offshoot of [[Advaita Vedanta]], which doctrine maintains that the perceived phenomenal world comes into existence only in the process of man’s observation of the world which is seen as a world of his own mental construction; having no objective reality, it exists only in his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The First Spring Part 2|author=Abraham Eraly|publisher=Penguin|page=124|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=_KFQAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT124&amp;dq=Drishtisrishtivada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mmySVMTlHciauQStkIGYAg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Drishtisrishtivada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, mind is the cause of the universe and not the subtle cosmic elements; mind which is consciousness creates the world. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga Vasishta|author=K.N.S.ubramanian|publisher=Sura Books|page=87|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tq9TSJGtemsC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=Drishtisrishtivada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mmySVMTlHciauQStkIGYAg&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Drishtisrishtivada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine is aligned with the doctrine of ''Ajatavada'', that of 'non-causality'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Exopolitics: Stargate to a New Reality|author=P.L.Harris|publisher=Authorhouse|page=xvii|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=3VayXgbup4sC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq=Drishtisrishtivada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mmySVMTlHciauQStkIGYAg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Drishtisrishtivada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] did not see subjectivism as a natural consequence of [[Maya (illusion)|Mayavada]], but much later a kind of subjective idealism was introduced by Prakasananda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Krishna|author=Edwin F. Bryant|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=325|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=0z02cZe8PU8C&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=Drishtisrishtivada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mmySVMTlHciauQStkIGYAg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Drishtisrishtivada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prakasananda propounded his doctrine of ''Drishti-srishti-vada'' in his work titled, ''Siddhanta-Muktavali'', on which Nana Dikshita had written a commentary called ''Siddhanta-pradipika''. In so doing he denied the objective character of [[Maya (illusion)|maya]]. According to him all phenomena are subjective or imagined, and exist so long as are perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preceptors of Advaita – Prakasananda|publisher=Kamakoti.org|url= http://www.kamakoti.org/kamakoti/articles/Preceptors%20of%20Advaita%20-%2035.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, [[Madhusūdana Sarasvatī|Madhusudana]] in his ''Siddhanta-bindu'' explains that [[Ishvara]] is Pure consciousness [[Brahman]] afflicted by nescience, and the reflection of consciousness in nescience is the [[jiva]] who is himself thus the material and efficient cause of the universe through his own nescience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Drishti-srishti-vada|url= http://www.indiadivine.org/content/topic/1393790-drishti-srishti-vada/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ramana Maharishi|Ramana]] termed this concept as the 'doctrine of simultaneous creation' or as the 'theory of false appearance', which theory maintains that all objects depend for their apparent existence upon the seer; that the world only exists when it is perceived, i.e. with the appearance of I-thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramana Maharishi on Creation|url= http://www.kheper.net/topics/Vedanta/Ramana_on_creation.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{emotion}}

'''Embarrassment''' or '''awkwardness''' is an [[emotion]]al state that is associated with mild to severe levels of discomfort, and which is usually experienced when someone has a socially unacceptable or frowned-upon act or condition that was witnessed by or revealed to others.

Usually some perception of loss of [[honor]] or [[dignity]] (or other high-value ideals) is involved, but the embarrassment level and the type depends on the situation. Embarrassment is similar to [[shame]] in some sense, except that shame may be experienced for an act known only to oneself.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Also, embarrassment usually carries the connotation of being caused by an act that is merely socially unacceptable, rather than [[morality|morally]] wrong.

== Causes ==
Embarrassment can be personal, caused by unwanted attention to private matters or personal flaws or mishaps.  Some causes of embarrassment stem from personal actions, such as being caught in a lie or in making a mistake. In many cultures, being seen [[nude]] or in [[underwear]] is a particularly stressful form of embarrassment (see [[Body modesty|modesty]]). Personal embarrassment can also stem from the actions of others who place the embarrassed person in a socially awkward situation—such as a parent showing one's baby pictures to friends, having someone make a derogatory comment about one's appearance or behaviour, discovering one is the victim of [[gossip]], being rejected by another person (see also [[humiliation]]), being made the focus of attention (e.g., [[birthday]] celebrants, newlyweds), or even witnessing someone else's embarrassment.

Personal embarrassment is usually accompanied by some combination of [[blushing]], [[sweating]], [[Anxiety|nervousness]], [[stammer]]ing, and [[fidgeting]].  Sometimes the embarrassed person tries to mask embarrassment with smiles or [[nervous laughter]], especially in etiquette situations. Such a response is more common in certain cultures, which may lead to misunderstanding. There may also be feelings of [[anger]] depending on the perceived seriousness of the situation, especially if the individual thinks another person is intentionally causing the embarrassment. There is a range of responses, with the most minor being a perception of the embarrassing act as inconsequential or even [[humor]]ous, to intense apprehension or fear.

The idea that embarrassment serves an apology or appeasement function originated with Goffman (1967) who argued the embarrassed individual "demonstrates that he/she is at least disturbed by the fact and may prove worthy at another time". Semin &amp; Manstead (1982) demonstrated social functions of embarrassment whereby the perpetrator of knocking over a sales display (the "bad act") was deemed more likable by others if he/she appeared embarrassed than if he/she appeared unconcerned – regardless of restitution behaviour (rebuilding the display). The capacity to experience embarrassment can also be seen as functional for the group or culture. It has been demonstrated that those who are not prone to embarrassment are more likely to engage in antisocial behaviour – for example, adolescent boys who displayed more embarrassment were found less likely to engage in aggressive/delinquent behaviours. Similarly, embarrassment exhibited by boys more likely to engage in aggressive/delinquent behaviour was less than one-third of that exhibited by non-aggressive boys (Ketlner et al. 1995). Thus proneness to embarrassment (i.e., a concern for how one is evaluated by others) can act as a brake on behaviour that would be dysfunctional for a group or culture.

===Professional embarrassment===
Embarrassment can also be '''professional''' or '''official''', especially after statements expressing confidence in a stated course of action, or willful disregard for evidence.  Embarrassment increases greatly in instances involving official duties or workplace facilities, large amounts of money or materials, or loss of human life.  Examples of causes include a government's failed public policy, exposure of corrupt practices or unethical behaviour, a celebrity whose personal habits receive public scrutiny or face legal action, or officials caught in serious personally embarrassing situations. Even small errors or miscalculations can lead to significantly greater official embarrassment if it is discovered that there was willful disregard for evidence or directives involved (e.g., see [[Space Shuttle Challenger]]).

Not all official failures result in official embarrassment, even if the circumstances lead to some slight personal embarrassment for the people involved.  For example, losing a close political election might cause some personal embarrassment for the candidate but generally would be considered an honorable loss in the profession and thus not necessarily lead to professional embarrassment. Similarly, a scientist might be personally disappointed and embarrassed if one of his hypotheses was proven wrong, but would not normally suffer professional embarrassment as a result.  By contrast, exposure of falsified data supporting a scientific claim (e.g., see [[Hwang Woo-Suk]]) would likely lead to professional embarrassment in the scientific community. Professional or official embarrassment is often accompanied by public expressions of [[anger]], [[denial]] of involvement, or attempts to [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimize]] the consequences.  Sometimes the embarrassed entity issues press statements, removes or distance themselves from sub-level employees, attempts to carry on as if nothing happened, suffers income loss, emigrates, or vanishes from public view.

===Vicarious embarrassment===

{{Main|Vicarious embarrassment}}
Vicarious embarrassment is an embarrassed feeling from observing the embarrassing actions of another person.&lt;ref name=validation&gt;Ahmet Uysal, Gülçin Akbas, Elif Helvacı, and Irem Metin, [https://www.academia.edu/6563886/Validation_and_correlates_of_the_vicarious_embarrassment_scale Validation and correlates of the vicarious embarrassment scale], ''Personality and Individual Differences'' 60 (2014), pp. 48–53&lt;/ref&gt; People who rate themselves as more empathic are more likely to experience vicarious embarrassment.&lt;ref name=eurekalert&gt;EurekAlert!, [https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-04/plos-yfa041211.php Your flaws are my pain], 13 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is present whether or not the observed party is aware of the embarrassing nature of their actions, although awareness generally increases the strength of the felt vicarious embarrassment, as does an accidental (as opposed to intentional) action.&lt;ref name=flaws&gt;Sören Krach, Jan Christopher Cohrs, Nicole Cruz de Echeverría Loebell, Tilo Kircher, Jens Sommer, Andreas Jansen, and Frieder Michel Paulus, [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018675 Your Flaws Are My Pain: Linking Empathy To Vicarious Embarrassment], PLoS ONE, 13 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types in social psychology===
[[File:Antoine Watteau 014.jpg|thumb|''An embarrassing proposal'' by [[Antoine Watteau]]]]
One typology of embarrassment is described by Sharkey and Stafford. There are six types of embarrassment:&lt;ref name="Withers &amp; Sherblom (1986)."&gt;{{cite journal|last = Withers|first = Lesley|last2=Sherblom|first2=John|title = Embarrassment: The Communication of an Awkward Actor Anticipating a Negative Evaluation|journal = Human Communication|volume = 11| issue = 2| pages = 237–254|year =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#[[Privacy]] violations – for example where [[Wardrobe malfunction|a part of the body is accidentally exposed]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Example of Embarrassing Wardrobe malfunction in college hostel|url=https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-embarrassing-things-girls-usually-do/answers/54002496|website=Quora}}&lt;/ref&gt; or there is an invasion of space, property, or information that may be warranted to privacy,
# Lack of [[knowledge]] and [[skill]] – for example forgetfulness, or experiencing failure while performing a relatively easy task
# [[Criticism]] and rejection – is another cause of embarrassment, as well as being made the center of attention positively or negatively
# Awkward acts – refer to social situations, for example inappropriate conversations, clumsiness or ungraceful actions (such as an emotional outbreak like speaking out unintentionally) that can trigger embarrassment
# Appropriate image – refers to more of a personal reflection of embarrassment, like body image, clothing apparel, and personal possessions for example owning a regular phone in compared to the latest phone
# [[Social environment|Environment]] – can also have the effect of provoking embarrassment, as when an individual in a movie theatre with his or her parents, other family, co-workers, or mixed-company peers is made uncomfortable by an unexpected occurrence of nudity in the film that the group is watching.

Another typology, by Cupach and Metts, discusses the dimensions of intended-unintended and appropriate-inappropriate behavior, and four basic types of embarrassing circumstances: 
# Faux pas (socially awkward acts)
# [[Accidents]]
# Mistakes
# Failure to perform a duty or moral obligation.

Based on these types, Cupach and Metts classify two basic embarrassment situations: the actor responsible and the observer responsible. Actor responsible situations are embarrassing when a person executes an act that is either inappropriate to a point of proficiency matching social norms and expectations, inconsistent with role expectations, or is out-of-sync with a [[social identity]]. The observer responsible categories are embarrassing when an individual becomes the focus of attention through:
* Recognition, praise, criticism, correction, or teasing
* Becomes initialized through being tripped or bumped, which is then associated with someone acting inappropriately
* Has information revealed publicly to another individual or peer group

==Etymology==
The first known written occurrence of ''embarrass'' in English was in 1664 by [[Samuel Pepys]] in his diary. The word derives from the French word ''embarrasser'', "to block" or "obstruct",&lt;sup&gt;[[#endnotes|1]]&lt;/sup&gt; whose first recorded usage was by [[Michel de Montaigne]] in 1580. The French word was derived from the Spanish ''[[embarazar]]'', whose first recorded usage was in 1460 in ''Cancionero de Stúñiga'' (Songbook of Stúñiga) by [[Álvaro de Luna]].&lt;sup&gt;[[#endnotes|2]]&lt;/sup&gt; The Spanish word comes from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''embaraçar'', which is a combination of the [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] ''em-'' (from Latin ''im-'' for "in-") with ''baraço'' or ''baraça'', "a noose" or "rope".&lt;sup&gt;[[#endnotes|3]]&lt;/sup&gt; ''Baraça'' originated before the Romans began their conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 218 BC.&lt;sup&gt;[[#endnotes|4]]&lt;/sup&gt; Thus, ''baraça'' could be related to the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word ''barr'', "tuft". (Celtic people actually settled much of Spain and Portugal beginning in the 8th century BC)&lt;sup&gt;[[#endnotes|5]]&lt;/sup&gt; However, it certainly is not directly derived from it, as the substitution of ''r'' for ''rr'' in [[Iberian Romance languages|Ibero-Romantic]] languages was not a known occurrence.

The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word may come from the Italian ''imbarazzare'', from ''imbarazzo'', "obstacle" or "obstruction". That word came from ''imbarrare'', "to block" or "bar", which is a combination of ''in-'', "in" with ''barra'', "bar" (from the [[Vulgar Latin]] ''barra'', which is of unknown origin).&lt;sup&gt;[[#endnotes|6]]&lt;/sup&gt; The problem with this theory is that the first known usage of the word in Italian was by [[Bernardo Davanzati]] (1529–1606), long after the word had entered Spanish.&lt;sup&gt;[[#endnotes|7]]&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Endogenous preferences''' are [[preference]]s that cannot be taken as given, but are affected by individual internal responses to the external [[State of affairs (sociology)|state of affairs]]. They are interdependent, in part determined by social institutions, marketed advertisement, and subject to learning (experience and observation) and habit formation (past-experience).

'''Engineers Without Borders Ireland''' is an [[international development]] organisation for students and professionals from [[Ireland]] who share a common interest in [[sustainable development]] through engineering and [[appropriate technologies]].

The organisation was initially founded in 2007, and partook in a 2-week project in the [http://www.sonairte.ie/ Sonairte: The National Ecology Centre] in Co. Meath, Ireland. After a lull in activities, a small group of engineers began discussions on reviving EWB-Ireland in 2009. These discussions led to the formation of EWB-Ireland's first ever national committee in January 2010. The committee is a small group of committed engineers from numerous disciplines, located throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewb-ireland.org/history EWB-Ireland Website - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, EWB-Ireland has branches in [[University College Dublin]] and [[Queens University Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewb-ireland.org/branches EWB Ireland Website - Branches]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
'''Enterprise Dynamics''' is based on the Taylor II simulation software, which was developed by F&amp;H Simulations.&lt;ref&gt;William B. Nordgren. "Taylor II manufacturing simulation software". ''In Proceedings of the 27th Conference on Winter Simulation, IEEE Computer Society'', Washington, DC, 401–404, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the newly developed simulation platform Taylor Enterprise Dynamics was introduced and in 2000, F&amp;H Simulations was acquired by the consulting company and simulation software distributor Incontrol Business Engineers. The new company name became [[INCONTROL Simulation Solutions]] and Taylor ED was renamed to '''Enterprise Dynamics'''. At this time F&amp;H Simulations, now called Flexsim Software Products, became independent and developed a new simulation software called [[Flexsim]].&lt;ref name="ED Brochures"&gt;{{cite web|title=ED Brochures|url=http://support.incontrolsim.com/en/ed-brochures.html|accessdate=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flexsim company history|url=http://www.flexsim.com/company/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
'''Enterprise Dynamics''' is an object-oriented simulation platform combined with an event-oriented approach. The user can select standard simulation objects (the so-called 'Atoms'), in which the behavior of their real life equivalents is captured, from a library and create a model by clicking and dragging the objects into the model space. For each simulation object, parameters can be altered to change its behavior.&lt;ref name="DW Dillen Book"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y.H. Lian, H.

:''Not to be confused are [[UFO religion]]s or [[ancient astronaut]] theories that posit that historical religious scripture or mythology was inspired by visits from extraterrestrials.''
:''"Exotheism" is a fictional denomination in the [[Vampire: The Requiem]] role-playing game.''

The term "'''exotheology'''" was coined in the 1960s or early 1970s&lt;ref&gt;An early attestation is the title "A Jewish Exotheology" in Norman Lamm, ''Faith and Doubt: Studies in Traditional Jewish Thought'', Ktav Pub. House, 1971, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; for the examination of [[theology|theological]] issues as they pertain to [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial intelligence]]. It is primarily concerned with either conjecture about possible theological beliefs that extraterrestrials might have, or how our own theologies have been or will be influenced by evidence of and/or interaction with extraterrestrials.

One of the main themes of exotheology is applying the concept of extraterrestrials who are sentient, and more to the point, endowed with a [[soul]],  as a [[thought experiment]] to the examination of a given theology, mostly [[Christian theology]], occasionally also [[Jewish theology]].

==Christianity==
A Christian writer early to address the question was [[C. S. Lewis]] (1898–1963) who in a 1950s article  in the  ''Christian Herald'' contemplated the possibility of the [[Son of God]] incarnating in other, extraterrestrial, worlds, or else that God could devise an entirely distinct plan of salvation for extraterrestrial communities from the one applicable to humans.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web

Lutheran theologian [[Ted Peters (theologian)|Ted Peters]] (2003) asserts that the questions raised by the possibility of extraterrestrial life are by no means new to Christian theology and by no means pose, as asserted by other authors, a threat for Christian dogma. Peters points out that medieval theology had frequently considered the question of "what if God had created many worlds?", as early as the discussion of the [[Antipodes]] by the  [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Peters, ''Science, theology, and ethics'', Ashgate science and religion series, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-0825-7}}, chapter 6: "Exotheology: Speculations on Extraterrestrial Life"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Holy See|Vatican]] theologian [[Corrado Balducci]] often discussed the question in Italian popular media, and in 2001 published a statement ''UFOs and Extraterrestrials - A Problem for the Church?''.
In a 2008 statement, [[José Gabriel Funes]], head of the Vatican Observatory, said
"Just as there is a multiplicity of creatures on earth, there can be other beings, even intelligent, created by God. This is not in contrast with our faith because we can't put limits on God's creative freedom".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/technology/science/science/story.html?id=fa0c5620-4d7f-44e6-9436-5cd4cb7153ac Vatican scientist says belief in God and aliens is OK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220145808/http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/technology/science/science/story.html?id=fa0c5620-4d7f-44e6-9436-5cd4cb7153ac |date=20 February 2009 }} Reuters, May 14, 2008

Smaller denominations also have similar treatments in passing in their key writings: [[Christian Science]] and the [[A Course in Miracles|Course in Miracles]] treat extraterrestrials as effectively brother spiritual beings in a non-absolute physical experience, the founder of the former writing, "The universe of Spirit is peopled with spiritual beings,...",&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Baker Eddy|Eddy, Mary Baker]], [[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]], p. 264:32.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] wrote, "Anyone with a sound intellect can know from many considerations that there are numerous worlds with people on them. Rational thought leads to the conclusion that massive bodies such as the planets, some of which are larger than our own earth, are not empty masses created merely to wander aimlessly around the sun, and shine with their feeble light on one planet. No, they must have a much greater purpose than that. ... What would one planet be to God, who is infinite, and for whom thousands, or even tens of thousands of planets, all full of inhabitants, would be such a trifling matter as to be almost nothing?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

While other [[Protestant]] denominations have tended to be somewhat terracentric, much as [[Roman Catholicism]] was until more recent times, receptivity to the idea of extraterrestrial civilizations likely depends on the degree of associated [[biblical literalism]].  Those of more fundamentalist leanings as interviewed occasionally on UFO- and paranormal-themed radio shows like [[Coast to Coast AM]] often try to fit extraterrestrial beings into the mold of [[demon]]s or [[Nephilim]], lacking much better category in which to place them, whereas schools of less literal persuasion would be more open to alternative perspectives.  These would include either fundamental reexamination of traditional assumptions, some reconsideration of extraterrestrials as in some sense [[angels]], or at least wider interpretations possible in the saying ascribed to [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]], "And other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.",&lt;ref&gt;The [[Christian]] [[Bible]] ([[King James Version]]), [[Gospel of John|John]] 10:16&lt;/ref&gt; which while probably quite presumptuous-sounding in the very large cosmic perspective could potentially lend itself to a reading in some more impersonal sense as well better befitting the larger magnitude of exotheology.{{Original research inline|date=August 2016}}

==Judaism==
Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]], who was also a physicist, was inclined toward the belief in extraterrestrial life, citing various classic Jewish authorities. Among them are the medieval philosopher Rabbi Chasdai Crescas (Ohr Hashem 4:2) and 18th century kabbalist Rabbi Pinchas Eliyahu Horowitz (Sefer HaBris). After presenting his sources, Rabbi Kaplan remarks, "We therefore find the basic thesis of the Sefer HaBris supported by a number of clear-cut statements by our Sages. There may even be other forms of intelligent life in the universe, but such life forms do not have free will, and therefore do not have moral responsibility"—at least in the same sense as human beings.&lt;ref&gt;
[Aryeh Kaplan. "On Extraterrestrial Life."] The Aryeh Kaplan Reader, Artscroll/Mesorah Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;
Rabbi Kaplan also cites Judges 5:23 ("Cursed is Meroz..."), about which Rashi, the foremost medieval commentator remarks, "Some say [Meroz] was a planet, and some say [Meroz] was a prominent person who was near the battle area and yet did not come [to intervene]." (The basis of Rashi's comment is a Talmudic discussion in tractate Moed Katan 16a. However, the verse in Judges is more commonly understood as a literary usage by Deborah the Prophetess and not an affirmation of possible intelligent life on another planet.)

Rabbi [[Norman Lamm]], former chancellor of [[Yeshiva University]], has also written on this subject, asserting that if the existence of extraterrestrial life should be confirmed, religious scholars must revise previous assumptions to the contrary. He, too, does not rule out this possibility from an Orthodox Jewish point of view.&lt;ref&gt;
"A Jewish Exotheology," published as Chapter 5 in Norman Lamm, ''Faith and doubt: studies in traditional Jewish thought'', Ktav Pub. House, 1971, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], an eminent 20th century Talmudic authority and rabbinical leader, is cited as having been open-minded about extraterrestrial life. He is said to have remarked that life on other planets would only reflect God's greatness, which exceeds mortal understanding, while not contradicting the role of the Jewish people to heed the Torah and in so doing to perform God's will here on earth.&lt;ref&gt;
David Holzer, ''The Rav: Thinking Aloud'', HolzerSeforim, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
Depending on the [[sura]]s cited, the [[Quran]] of [[Islam]] appears to leave open the door to the idea of extraterrestrials, as in 27:65, situated similarly on a par with humans subject to a divine judgment leading toward a [[heaven]] or [[hell]] as reward or punishment for the deeds of one's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Harry''' is a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] derogatory term used in slang, derived from the [[England|English]] name [[Harry (name)|Harry]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dokpro.uio.no/perl/ordboksoek/ordbok.cgi?OPP=harry&amp;bokmaal=S%F8k+i+Bokm%E5lsordboka&amp;ordbok=bokmaal&amp;alfabet=n&amp;renset=j |title=Entry on "harry" |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best English translation may be "cheesy" or "tacky". ''[[Norsk ordbok (Riksmål)|Norsk ordbok]]'' defines "harry" as "tasteless, vulgar".&lt;ref name="no" /&gt;

The term "harry" was first used by [[upper class]] youth in [[Oslo]] in the beginning of the 20th century, and was used to describe people who belonged to the [[working class]]. People in the lower social classes at the time often gave their children [[England|English]] first names such as [[Harry (name)|Harry]]. The middle and upper classes mostly preferred Scandinavian or German (and occasionally French) names. English names (except English names that are also widely found in other European languages) had no tradition in Scandinavia and were generally considered bad taste and as a phenomenon of the working-class of the time in all the Scandinavian countries. The traditional elite of Norway mostly used conservative Danish names.

A person who is ''harry'' is often perceived as unsophisticated, vulgar or with bad taste.&lt;ref name="Dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="no"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ordnett.no/ordbok.html?search=harry&amp;search_type=&amp;publications=23 |title=Entry on "Harry" |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="financialExpress"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/&amp;8216harry&amp;8217-pottiness-stirs-swedishnorwegian-shop-war/40443/|title=‘Harry’ Pottiness Stirs Swedish-Norwegian Shop War|date=March 16, 2002|publisher=Financial Express|accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of bad taste is often characterized with the term ''harry'', e.g. a ''harry'' dress or a ''harry'' car. Since the definition of good and bad taste is defined by fashion, there is no precise definition of ''harry''. [[D.D.E. (band)|D.D.E.]], [[Sputnik_(singer)|Sputnik]], shopping in [[Sweden]], [[Raggare]] culture and [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]]s are often mentioned today. In the 1970s it was the 1960s' hairwax or sharp shoes that were harry. In the 1980s the 1970s' flared pants or whiskers, and in the 1990s more or less everything that could be associated with the 1980s. Yesterday's fashion will often be interpreted as harry. Often what is harry in one period can be hip [[retro]] fashion the next year.

Harry may also be interpreted as something like [[Machismo|macho]]. The feminine parallel is ''doris''.

The term was repopularised by then minister of Agriculture [[Lars Sponheim]] in 2002 to describe Norwegians who drive (in some cases, for hours) to reach and cross the border to [[Sweden]] in order to [[Border trade|purchase groceries, tobacco and alcohol at cheaper prices]]. Responses to this were retorts that seeking out bargains is smart shopping, and Swedish shops introduced humorous campaigns with one shopkeeper giving 1000 [[Swedish krona|SEK]] to customers named "Harry".&lt;ref name="financialExpress"/&gt; The terms ''Harrytur'' ("Harry trip") or ''Harryhandel'' ("Harry trade") have since been popular descriptions of this trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/02/16/nyheter/utenriks/harry-handel/4884668/ Harryhandel til halv pris] Dagbladet, February 16, 2009 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was translated into more than 500 languages worldwide.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Demand for Human Rights Education ==
The demand for human rights education continues to grow globally. Academic institutions are in the position to train students as future business leaders capable of managing human rights impact on their respective corporate organizations. The [[United Nations Global Compact]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unglobalcompact.org/take-action/action/human-rights-open-letter-to-academics|title=Make Human Rights Part of Management Education {{!}} UN Global Compact|website=www.unglobalcompact.org|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in cooperation with the Principles for Responsible Management Education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://responsiblebusiness.haas.berkeley.edu/curriculum/prme.html|title=Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) - Center for Responsible Business {{!}} Berkeley-Haas|website=responsiblebusiness.haas.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; invites different corporations to incorporate business along with human rights topics to their curricula. 

The Asia-Pacific Center for Education for International Understanding and the [[United Nations Academic Impact]] mutually organized the 2018 United Nations Global Citizenship Education Seminar at the UN Headquarters in New York City.  These seminars are useful in the formulation of new ideas and concepts related to HRE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://academicimpact.un.org/content/2018-united-nations-global-citizenship-education-seminar|title=2018 United Nations Global Citizenship Education Seminar|last=OmarHernandez|date=2018-05-09|website=academicimpact.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Education is crucial because it is one of the keys to making governments and political leaders accountable. It also imparts and spreads out the human rights vocabulary and provides a critical approach towards human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=From Citizenship to Human Rights to Human Rights Education|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5040/9781472566461.ch-009|work=Making Human Rights Intelligible : Towards a Sociology of Human Rights|publisher=Hart Publishing|isbn=9781849463959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights education history==
The emphasis on Human Rights Education began in 1995 with the beginning of the UN Decade for Human Rights Education, though previously addressed in 1953 with the UNESCO Associated Schools Program, which served as an “initial attempt to teach human rights in formal school settings”. The first formal request for the need to educate students about human rights came about in UNESCO’s 1974 article Recommendation concerning Education for International Understanding, Cooperation and Peace, and Education Relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  The participants of the International Congress on the Teaching of Humans Rights eventually met in 1978 to form a specific definition of what would be required application of the education in formal curricula. The aims at which the Congress agreed upon including the encouragement of tolerant attitudes with focus on respect, providing knowledge of human rights in the context of national and international dimensions as well as their implementations, and finally developing awareness of human rights translating into reality whether social or political on national and international levels.

Human Rights Education became an official central concern internationally after the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993.  This conference brought the issue of educating formally to the top of many countries’ priority lists and was brought to the attention of the United Nations. It was two years later that the United Nations approved the Decade for Human Rights Education, which reformed the aims of application once again. Since the development of the UN Decade, the incorporation of human rights education into formal school curricula has been developed and diversified with the assistance of nongovernmental organizations, intergovernmental organizations, and individuals dedicated to spreading the topic through formal education.

Today{{When|date=April 2017}} the most influential document used to determine what qualifies as human rights and how to implement these ideas and rights into everyday life is the Universal Declaration.  The declaration was adopted by the General Assembly in 1948, making December 10 annual [[Human Rights Day]] ever since.  To this day the 30 article compilation is seen{{By whom|date=April 2017}} as “a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanrightseducation.info&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights education at schools==

Several schools offer human rights education as part of their curriculum, for example linked subjects like History, Politics and Citizenship, but there are also specialised courses, such as Human Rights offered as part of the International Bacclaureate Diploma programme for high school students.

IB Human Rights is an academic subject containing units on:

* The theory of human rights
* The practise of human rights
* Contemporary human rights issues

In order to pass the course students are required to study for two years, take a final examination and produce a coursework.

As part of their diploma programme, students may also choose to write their Extended Essay on Human Rights. This is a 4000 word research paper focusing on human rights.

The IB Human Rights course was originally authored by Joni Mäkivirta, the developer of [[Cognitive Emotional Pedagogy]]. Part of the 2002 version of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110411121849/http://www.hrea.org/erc/Library/pre-service/syllabus-ibo02.pdf IB Human Rights] syllabus is at the Global Human Rights Education (HREA) website. Only part of the syllabus is available at the HREA website for copyright reasons.

The complete IB Human Rights syllabus that contains more details, including the assessment criteria, as well as the guide for the Human Rights Extended Essay can be acquired from [http://www.ibo.org the International Baccalaureate Organisation].

Some cities in the world have adopted a municipal law to stimulate successfully the HRE in the public schools, as the example of the Municipal Plan of HRE of the city of São Paulo (Decreto Nº 57.503, DE 6 DE Dezembro de 2016), in Brazil [http://portaledh.educapx.com/].

==Human rights education uses in the 21st century==

* As a strategy for development (Clarence Dias)
* As [[empowerment]] (Garth Meintjes)
* As a way of change for [[women’s rights]] (Dorota Gierycz)
* As a legal prospective and for law enforcement (Edy Kaufman)&lt;ref&gt;"Andreopoulos, George J., and Richard Pierre Claude. Human Rights Education for the Twenty-first Century. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania, 1997. PDF."&lt;/ref&gt;
* As a legal education for social transformations and human sensibility (Eduardo Bittar) - "http://www.lawandliterature.org/area/documenti/Bittar%202014%20Vol.%207.pdf"

==Human rights education models==
1.	'''Values and awareness'''
The Values and Awareness Model focuses on transmitting “basic knowledge of human rights issues and to foster its integration into public values” based on its philosophical-historical approach. This model is what people commonly think of when human rights are concerned with the target audience being the general public with topics including global human rights and more cultural based matters.

2.	'''Accountability'''
The Accountability Model is associated with the legal and political approach to human rights in which the learners which the model targets are already involved via professional roles.  The model is incorporated by means of training and networking, covering topics such as court cases, codes of ethics, and how to deal with the media.

3.	'''Transformational''' 
This model of education focuses on the psychological and sociological aspects of human rights.  The topics towards which this model is effective are those including vulnerable populations and people with personal experiences effected by the topic, such as women and minorities. The model aims to empower the individual, such as those victims of abuse and trauma. The model is geared towards recognizing the abuse of human rights but is also committed to preventing these abuses.&lt;ref&gt;"Understanding what we do: emerging models for human rights education by Felisa Tibbitts International Review of Education volume 48, numbers 3-4, pgs 159-171"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

[[Sudbury model|Sudbury model of democratic education]] schools maintain that [[values]], [[human rights]] included, must be [[Experiential learning|learned through experience]]&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1992), Education in America - A View from Sudbury Valley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YQn_BA76TF4C&amp;pg=PA60 ''"'Ethics' is a Course Taught By Life Experience."'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D.

(eds) (2005) ''Oxford Dictionary of Scientific Quotations.'' Oxford University Press. 21:9.&lt;/ref&gt; They adduce that for this purpose schools must encourage ethical behavior and personal responsibility. In order to achieve these goals schools must respect human rights in school by allowing students the three great freedoms—freedom of choice, freedom of action and freedom to bear the results of action—that constitute personal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987) The Sudbury Valley School Experience [http://www.sudval.com/05_underlyingideas.html#09 ''"Back to Basics."'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4591">The '''Institute for Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding''' ('''ICP''') is a Swiss non-governmental organization specialized in the promotion of non-violent conflict transformation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iicp.ch/node/10 ICP approach to Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150209195513/http://www.iicp.ch/node/10 |date=2015-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by Pascal Gemperli and Uri Ziegele in 2007, the organization focuses on promoting [[conflict transformation]] and [[peacebuilding]] through peace mediation courses and trainings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iicp.ch/content/trainings-overview Education and training organized by ICP]&lt;/ref&gt; Its comprehensive approach is based on interdisciplinary practice and research in the areas of international peace and conflict research, critical systems theory, culture and communication studies, political psychology, group psychotherapy and other related fields. The ICP has offices in both Bern and Morges (Switzerland). It is accredited ECOSOC &lt;ref name=ECOSOC&gt;[http://csonet.org/content/documents/e2013inf6.pdf Database of NGOs granted with consultative status with ECOSOC]&lt;/ref&gt; and certified EDUQUA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eduqua.ch List of all certified EDUQUA institutions]&lt;/ref&gt; It is active in the following countries: Switzerland, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Morocco, Azerbaijan and Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;KOFF (Swisspeace) Interactive Map and Database on NGOs' regions of action [http://koff.swisspeace.ch/who-is-involved/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

The ICP offers mediation services on the one hand, and organizes peace mediation trainings and workshops on the other hand. Hence it is active both in mediation and in the promotion of peacebuilding through education, in Switzerland and abroad.

The ICP holds a Konfliktbüro (conflict office) in Bern. The office proposes mediation services to enterprises, institutions and administrations as well as to individuals. The advanced training Die Kunst der Konfliktbearbeitung (The Art of Conflict Transformation) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iicp.ch/cas ICP's Die Kunst der Konfliktbearbeitung website]&lt;/ref&gt; is recognized by the Swiss Federation for Mediation Associations (SDM-FSM) &lt;ref&gt;Organizations recognized by the Swiss Federation for Mediation Associations [http://www.infomediation.ch/cms/tab_ausbildungslehrgaenge.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and organized in partnership with the University of Basel.

Every summer since 2008, the ICP organizes the International Summer Academy and Forum on Peace Mediation and National Dialogue,&lt;ref&gt;International Academy and Forum on Peace Mediation and National Dialogue website [http://www.iicp.ch/summer-academy]&lt;/ref&gt; which is a mediation and peacebuilding training taking place in Caux (Montreux, Switzerland). This one-week course allows participants to attend classes about peace mediation and to take advantage of the skills and knowledge of international experts in the field. Participants also acquire practical skills through peace mediation simulations. Each year, the focus of the course changes slightly: new topics are introduced and other perspectives presented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iicp.ch/summer-academy/history-overview International Summer Academy and Forum: History Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the Summer Academy can also decide to attend the International Peace-builders' Forum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caux.ch/en/International-Peacebuilders-Forum-IPF The International Peacebuilders Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; which takes place in Caux, usually just before the beginning of the Summer Academy.

The Institute for Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding is jointly involved with the Universities of Basel, Belgrade, Sarajevo and Zagreb in the creation of a regional Master in Peace Studies in South-East Europe &lt;ref&gt;[http://see-peace.net Regional Master's in Peace Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3663">'''Intellectual virtues''' are qualities of mind and character that promote intellectual flourishing, critical thinking, and the pursuit of truth. They include: intellectual responsibility, [[wikt:perseverance|perseverance]], open-mindedness, [[empathy]], [[integrity]], [[intellectual courage]], confidence in reason, love of truth, intellectual humility, imaginativeness, curiosity, fair-mindedness, and [[autonomy]]. So-called virtue responsibilists conceive of intellectual virtues primarily as acquired character traits, such as intellectual conscientiousness and love of knowledge. Virtue reliabilists, by contrast, think of intellectual virtues more in terms of well-functioning mental faculties such as perception, memory, and intuition. Intellectual virtues are studied extensively in both [[critical thinking]] and [[virtue epistemology]].

== Aristotle ==
[[Aristotle]] analyzed [[virtue]]s into '''moral''' and '''intellectual virtues'''. In the ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' and ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' he identified five intellectual virtues as the five ways the soul arrives at truth by affirmation or denial. These are then separated into three classes:
*'''Theoretical'''
**''[[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]'' – wisdom (rational intuition and scientific knowledge directed toward the highest and most valuable objects)
**''[[Episteme#Plato_and_Aristotle|Episteme]]'' – scientific knowledge of objects that are necessary and unchanging
**''[[Nous#Aristotle|Nous]]'' – rational intuition of first principles or self-evident truths
*'''Practical'''
**''[[Phronesis]]'' – practical wisdom/prudence
*'''Productive'''
**''[[Techne]]'' – craft knowledge, art, skill

Subjacent intellectual virtues in Aristotle:
*''[[Euboulia]]'' – deliberating well, deliberative excellence; thinking properly about the right end.
* ''[[Sunesis]]'' – understanding, sagacity, astuteness, consciousness of why something is as it is. For example, the understanding you have of why a situation is as it is, prior to having ''phronesis''.
*''[[Gnomê]]'' – judgement and consideration; allowing us to make equitable or fair decisions.
*''[[Deinotes]]'' – cleverness; the ability to carry out actions so as to achieve a goal.

On 10 November 1998, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] proclaimed the first decade of the 21st century and the third millennium, the years 2001 to 2010, as the [[International Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World]].

Since 2001, some national NGOs coalitions promoting the Decade have been established in several countries, including Austria, France, Italy and the Netherlands. 
These national coalitions along with international organizations decided to found the '''International Coalition for the Decade''' for the Culture of Peace and Nonviolence in June 2003.

Its office is based in [[Paris]] and its president is [[Christian Renoux]] ([[France]]).

'''International Day of the Girl Child''' is an international observance day declared by the United Nations; it is also called the '''Day of Girls''' and the '''International Day of the Girl'''. [[October 11]], 2012, was the first Day of the Girl Child.

The Day of Girls helps raise awareness not only of the issues that girls face, but also what is likely to happen when those problems are solved. For example, educating girls helps reduce the rate of child marriage, disease and helps strengthen the [[economy]] by helping girls have access to higher paying jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://schoolsofthought.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/11/education-a-focus-on-international-day-of-the-girl-child/|title=Education a Focus on International Day of the Girl Child|last=Krache|first=Donna|date=11 October 2012|work=CNN|access-date=11 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/camille-crittenden/science-math-programs-matter_b_1944249.html|title=International Day of the Girl: Why Science &amp; Math Programs Matter|last=Crittenden|first=Camille|date=8 October 2012|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=11 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:International Day of the Girl Child for 2014.jpg|alt=Girls at a 2014 International Day of the Girl Child Event.|thumb|Girls at a 2014 International Day of Girls Event.]]
The International Day of Girls initiative began as a project of [[Plan (aid organisation)|Plan International]], a non-governmental organization that operates worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=201609280700CANADANWCANADAPR.C2019&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Challenge Accepted!

Plan International representatives in [[Canada]] approached the Canadian federal government to seek to the coalition of supporters [[raised awareness]] of the initiative internationally. Eventually, Plan International urged the [[United Nations]] to become involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/katy-ma-/international-day-of-the-girl_b_4080548.html|title=What Is the International Day of the Girl Child?|last=Ma|first=Katy|date=10 October 2013|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=11 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International Day of Girls was formally proposed as a resolution by Canada in the United Nations General Assembly. [[Rona Ambrose]], Canada's Minister for the Status of Women, sponsored the resolution; a delegation of women and girls made presentations in support of the initiative at the 55th [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]]. On December 19, 2011, the United Nations General Assembly voted to pass a resolution adopting October 11, 2012 as the inaugural International Day of Girls.&lt;ref name="ambrose1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ambrose, Rona and Rosemary McCarney|title=International Day of the Girl Child: girls' rights are human rights|url=http://blogs.edmontonjournal.com/2011/12/29/international-day-of-the-girl-child-a-canadian-accomplishment/|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=Edmonton Journal|date=December 29, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719031013/http://blogs.edmontonjournal.com/2011/12/29/international-day-of-the-girl-child-a-canadian-accomplishment/|archivedate=July 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution states that the Day of Girls recognizes {{blockquote|[the] empowerment of and investment in girls, which are critical for economic growth, the achievement of all [[Millennium Development Goal]]s, including the [[poverty reduction|eradication of poverty]] and [[extreme poverty]], as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing also that empowering girls requires their active participation in [[decision-making]] processes and the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, as well as boys and men and the wider community [...] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution Adopted by the General Assembly: 66/170 International Day of the Girl Child|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/66/170|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; |sign=|source=}}

'''John Toland''' (30 November 1670 – 11 March 1722) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[rationalist]] philosopher and [[freethought|freethinker]], and occasional satirist, who wrote numerous books and pamphlets on [[political philosophy]] and [[philosophy of religion]], which are early expressions of the philosophy of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Born in Ireland, he was educated at the universities of [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Leiden|Leiden]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and was influenced by the philosophy of [[John Locke]].

His first, and best known work, was ''[[Christianity not Mysterious]]'' (1696).

==Biography==
Very little is known of Toland's early life. He was born in [[Ardagh, County Donegal|Ardagh]] on the [[Inishowen|Inishowen Peninsula]], a predominantly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Irish language|Irish]]-speaking region in northwestern Ireland. His parents are unknown. He would later write that he had been baptised ''Janus Junius'', a play on his name that recalled both the Roman two-faced god [[Janus]] and [[Junius Brutus]], reputed founder of the [[Roman republic]]. According to his biographer [[Pierre des Maizeaux]], he adopted the name John as a schoolboy with the encouragement of his school teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Biography of John Toland by his contemporary Pierre des Maizeaux, dated 26 May 1722, which is readable online and downloadable at {{OL|806650W}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having formally converted from Catholicism to Protestantism at the age of 16, Toland got a scholarship to study theology at the [[University of Glasgow]]. In 1690, at age 19, the [[University of Edinburgh]] conferred a master's degree on him. He then got a scholarship to spend two years studying at [[University of Leiden]] in Holland, and subsequently nearly two years at Oxford in England (1694–95). The Leiden scholarship had been provided by wealthy [[English Dissenters]], who hoped Toland would go on to become a minister for Dissenters.

In Toland's first book ''[[Christianity not Mysterious]]'' (1696), he argued that the divine revelation of the Bible contains no true mysteries; rather, all the dogmas of the faith can be understood and demonstrated by properly trained reason from natural principles. For this argument he was prosecuted by a grand jury in London. As he was a subject of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], members of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] proposed that he should be burnt at the stake, and in his absence three copies of the book were burnt by the public hangman in [[Dublin]] as the content was contrary to the core doctrines of the [[Church of Ireland]]. Toland bitterly compared the Protestant legislators to "Popish [[Inquisition|Inquisitors]] who performed that Execution on the Book, when they could not seize the Author, whom they had destined to the Flames".&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert JT, ''History of the City of Dublin'' (1854) vol 3 p66.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his departure from Oxford Toland resided in London for most of the rest of his life, but was also a somewhat frequent visitor to the European continent, particularly Germany and the Netherlands. He lived on the Continent from 1707 to 1710. Toland died in Putney on 10 March 1722.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title='Manuscripts of Mine Abroad': John Toland and the Circulation of Ideas, c.1700-1722 |author=J. A. I. Champion |journal=Eighteenth-Century Ireland / Iris an dá chultúr |volume=14 |year=1999 |pages=9–36|jstor=30071408}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''1911 Encyclopædia Britannica'' says of him that at his death in London at age 51 "he died... as he had lived, in great poverty, in the midst of his books, with his pen in his hand." Just before he died, he composed his own epitaph: "He was an assertor of liberty, a lover of all sorts of learning ... but no man’s follower or dependent. Nor could frowns or fortune bend him to decline from the ways he had chosen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1xKG9ZehhQC&amp;pg=PA13 |title=''John Toland, his Methods, Manners and Mind'' by Stephen Daniel|isbn=9780773510074|author1=Daniel|first1=Stephen H|date=October 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very shortly after his death a lengthy biography of Toland was written by [[Pierre des Maizeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;This primary and authoritative source on the life of Toland is downloadable as a 92-page preface to the book ''A Collection of Several Pieces of John Toland'' {{OL|806650W}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political thought==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
John Toland was the first person called a [[Freethought|freethinker]] (by Bishop [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]) and went on to write over a hundred books in various domains but mostly dedicated to criticising ecclesiastical institutions. A great deal of his intellectual activity was dedicated to writing political tracts in support of the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] cause. Many scholars know him for his role as either the biographer or editor of notable republicans from the mid-17th century such as [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Algernon Sidney]] and [[John Milton]]. His works "Anglia Libera" and "State Anatomy" are prosaic expressions of an English republicanism which reconciles itself with constitutional monarchy.
[[File:Rare Medium PR 3581 .T574 000009.tif|thumb|left|The first page of "The Life of John Milton," authored by Toland in 1699. Digitized by the University of Notre Dame Hesburgh Libraries.]]

After ''Christianity Not Mysterious'', Toland's views became gradually more radical.  His opposition to hierarchy in the church also led to opposition to hierarchy in the state; bishops and kings, in other words, were as bad as each other, and monarchy had no God-given sanction as a form of government.  In his 1704 ''Letters to Serena'' – in which he used the expression '[[pantheism]]' – he carefully analyses the manner by which truth is arrived at, and why people are prone to forms of 'false consciousness.'

In politics his most radical proposition was that [[liberty]] was a defining characteristic of what it means to be human.  Political institutions should be designed to guarantee freedom, not simply to establish order.  For Toland, reason and tolerance were the twin pillars of the good society.  This was [[Whiggism]] at its most intellectually refined, the very antithesis of the [[Tory]] belief in sacred authority in both [[Church of England|church]] and [[Kingdom of England|state]].  Toland's belief in the need for perfect equality among free-born citizens was extended to the Jewish community, tolerated, but still outsiders in early 18th century England.  In his 1714 ''Reasons for Naturalising the Jews'' he was the first to advocate full citizenship and equal rights for [[Jew]]ish people.

Toland's world was not all detached intellectual speculation, though.  There was also an incendiary element to his political pamphleteering, and he was not beyond whipping up some of the baser [[Anticatholicism|anti-Catholic]] sentiments of the day in his attacks on the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]].

===Literary hoax "The Treatise of the Three Imposters"===
He also produced some highly controversial polemics, including the ''[[Treatise of the Three Impostors]]'', in which Christianity, [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] are all condemned as the three great political frauds. The ''Treatise of the Three Imposters'' was rumoured to exist in manuscript form since the Middle Ages and excoriated throughout all of Europe. It is now thought that the work did not exist.

Toland claimed to have a personal copy of the manuscript which he passed to the circle of [[Jean Rousset]] in France. Rumours that it was then translated into French were taken seriously by some: however, not by [[Voltaire]] who issued a satirical reply.&lt;ref&gt;''Making Man in Reason's Image : The Enlightenment and the Birth of Modern Humanity'' (Portable Professor Series) by James Schmidt.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editions of republican radicals of the 1650s===
His [[Republicanism|republican]] sympathies were also evidenced by his editing of the writings of some of the great radicals of the 1650s, including [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Algernon Sydney]], [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[John Milton]].  In his support for the Hanoverian monarchy he somewhat moderated his republican sentiments; though his ideal kingship was one that would work towards achieving civic virtue and social harmony, a 'just liberty' and the 'preservation and improvement of our reason.'  But [[George I of England|George I]] and the oligarchy behind Walpole were about as far from Toland's ideal as it is possible to get.  In many ways he was thus a man born both too late and too early.

==Contributions to natural philosophy==
Toland influenced [[Baron d'Holbach]]'s ideas about physical motion. In his ''Letters to Serena'', Toland claimed that rest, or absence of motion, is not merely relative. Actually, for Toland, rest is a special case of motion. When there is a conflict of forces, the body that is apparently at rest is influenced by as much activity and passivity as it would be if it were moving.

==Religious thought==

{{Refimprove section|date=January 2008}}
Toland identified himself as a [[pantheist]] in his publication ''Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist'' in 1705. At the time when he wrote ''Christianity not Mysterious'' he was careful to distinguish himself from both sceptical atheists and orthodox theologians. After having formulated a stricter version of [[John Locke|Locke]]'s [[epistemological]] rationalism, Toland then goes on to show that there are no facts or doctrines from the Bible which are not perfectly plain, intelligible and reasonable, being neither contrary to reason nor incomprehensible to it. All revelation is human revelation; that which is not rendered understandable is to be rejected as gibberish.

However, David Berman has argued for an atheistic reading of Toland, demonstrating contradictions between ''Christianity not Mysterious'' and Toland's ''Two Essays'' (London, 1695). Berman's reading of Toland and Charles Blount attempts to show that Toland deliberately obscured his real atheism so as to avoid prosecution whilst attempting to subliminally influence unknowing readers, specifically by creating contradictions in his work which can only be resolved by reducing Toland's God to a pantheistic one, and realising that such a non-providential God is, for Blount, Toland and Colins, "...no God, or as good as no God...In short, the God of theism is ''blictri'' for Toland; only the determined material God of pantheism exists, and he (or it) is really no God."&lt;ref&gt;David Berman,"Disclaimers in Blount and Toland", in: Hunter &amp; Wootton (eds.), ''Atheism from the Reformation to the Enlightenment'', (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1992) pp. 268–272&lt;/ref&gt;

After his ''Christianity not Mysterious'', Toland's "Letters to Serena" constitute his major contribution to philosophy. In the first three letters, he develops a historical account of the rise of superstition arguing that human reason cannot ever fully liberate itself from prejudices.  In the last two letters, he founds a metaphysical [[materialism]] grounded in a critique of monist substantialism.  Later on, we find Toland continuing his critique of church government in ''Nazarenus'' which was first more fully developed in his "Primitive Constitution of the Christian Church", a clandestine writing in circulation by 1705. The first book of "Nazarenus" calls attention to the right of the [[Ebionites]] to a place in the early church. The thrust of his argument was to push to the very limits the applicability of canonical scripture to establish institutionalised religion. Later works of special importance include Tetradymus wherein can be found Clidophorus, a historical study of the distinction between esoteric and exoteric philosophies.

His ''Pantheisticon, sive formula celebrandae sodalitatis socraticae'' (Pantheisticon, or the Form of Celebrating the Socratic Society), of which he printed a few copies for private circulation only, gave great offence as a sort of liturgic service made up of passages from pagan authors, in imitation of the [[Church of England]] liturgy. The title also was in those days alarming, and still more so the mystery which the author threw around the question how far such societies of pantheists actually existed. The term "[[pantheism]]" was used by Toland to describe the philosophy of [[Spinoza]].

Toland was famous for distinguishing exoteric philosophy—what one says publicly about religion—from esoteric philosophy—what one confides to trusted friends. In 2007 Fouke's ''Philosophy and Theology in a Burlesque Mode: John Toland and the Way of Paradox'' presented an analysis of Toland's 'exoteric strategy' of speaking as others speak, but with a different meaning. He argues that Toland's philosophy and theology had little to do with positive expression of beliefs, and that his philosophical aim was not to develop an epistemology, a true metaphysical system, an ideal form of governance, or the basis of ethical obligation, but to find ways to participate in the discourses of others while undermining those discourses from within. Fouke traces Toland's practices to Shaftesbury's conception of a comic or 'derisory' mode of philosophising aimed at exposing pedantry, imposture, dogmatism, and folly.

==Influence and legacy==
Toland was a man not of his time; one who advocated principles of virtue in duty, principles that had little place in the England of [[Robert Walpole]], governed by cynicism and self-interest.  His intellectual reputation, moreover, was subsequently eclipsed by the likes of [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]], and still more by [[Montesquieu]] and the French radical thinkers. [[Edmund Burke]] in his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' wrote dismissively of Toland and his fellows: "Who, born within the last 40 years, has read one word of [[Anthony Collins|Collins]], and Toland, and [[Matthew Tindal|Tindal]], and [[Thomas Chubb|Chubb]], and [[Thomas Morgan (deist)|Morgan]], and that whole race who called themselves Freethinkers?"

Still, in ''Christianity not Mysterious'', the book for which he is best known, Toland laid down a challenge not just to the authority of the established church, but to all inherited and unquestioned authority.  It was thus as radical politically and philosophically, as it was theologically.

Of his influence, humanities professor Robert Pattison wrote: "Two centuries earlier the establishment would have burned him as a heretic; two centuries later it would have made him a professor of comparative religion in a California university. In the rational Protestant climate of early 18th-century Britain, he was merely ignored to death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pattison |first1=Robert |title=The Triumph of Vulgarity |year=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-503876-2 |oclc=13699782 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Toland managed to find success after his death: [[Thomas Hollis (1720–1774)|Thomas Hollis]], the great 18th century book collector and editor, commissioned the London bookseller [[Andrew Millar]] to publish works advocating republican government - a list of titles which included Toland's work in 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/4.html|title=The manuscripts, Letter from Andrew Millar to Thomas Cadell, 16 July, 1765.

'''Kristján Guðmundsson''' (born 1941, [[Snæfellsnes]], [[Iceland]]) is a contemporary [[Iceland]]ic conceptual artist.&lt;ref&gt;Galerie Anhava, Kristján Guðmundsson, [http://www.anhava.com/ CV], retrieved July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his career as an artist in the 1960s as a member of ''SÚM'' - a group of young artists influenced by then-new currents in conceptual and installation art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.artnews.is/artnews_article.php?no=23_11&amp;is=23|title=Kristján Guðmundsson Makes More with Less|accessdate = 24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived in the [[Netherlands]] in the 1970s where he received a Dutch stipend. There he came into more direct contact with the international avant-garde. In 1977, he was one of four Icelanders invited to exhibit in the new-opened [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris, France. He moved back to Iceland in 1979.

Kristján's art reflects both prevailing traditions in late 20th century western art in general, and the dominance of [[abstract art|abstract]] and [[conceptual art]] in the post-war [[art of Iceland]] in particular. He has said, "I am trying to work within the field of tension that exists between nothing and something".

In 1982 he represented Iceland at the [[Venice Biennale]]. 1993 he was one of three winners of the [[Prince Eugen Medal]] conferred by the King of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalcourt.se/download/18.30963a1811be3fda3ab80008195/Prins+Eugen-medaljen+1945-2010.pdf| title= Prins Eugan Medaljen|accessdate = 14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 he was the first Icelandic winner who got the Swedish [[Carnegie Art Award]], worth [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 1,000,000. He got it with his sound-absorbing pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gsa.se/artists/kristjan-gudmundsson/exhibition-2014/|title=Kristján Guðmundsson Exhibition 2010 Stockholm|accessdate = 24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Langmaker began as ''Model Languages'', a [[newsletter]] published by Henning between 1995 and 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.langmaker.com/backissu.htm Langmaker Back issues] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629200232/http://www.langmaker.com/backissu.htm |date=June 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he attempted to better publicize the hobby of conlanging and to explore various issues and questions related to conlanging.  Shortly, Henning moved to a [[website]] format.  He began not only discussing and commenting on [[conlangs]] but also cataloguing them in a comprehensive database, with overviews of the languages and links to their respective websites.  Henning ultimately began adding [[neologisms]]; babel texts; [[neography|neographies]]; books on [[languages]], [[linguistics]], and conlanging; and other general resources to his database.  Langmaker has been viewed by many as an information and activity hub in the online conlanging world.

In April 2007, Langmaker was converted to [[wiki]] format, allowing its many readers to themselves make contributions to the website.  Henning has since left the maintenance of the site primarily to its casual contributors and administrators, who continued to contribute up until January 4, 2008, when the site was locked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.langmaker.com/db/Special:Recentchanges Langmaker Special:Recentchanges web page]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806090920/http://www.langmaker.com/db/Special%3ARecentchanges |date=August  6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Rosenfelder]] writes, "Jeffrey Henning writes and posts regularly on the process of creating model languages and reviews a number of projects."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zompist.com/kit.html The Language Construction Kit], Accessed October 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 11, 2015, the domain name has been bought.

Douglas]] as the most disturbing individual for whom he has ever created a [[Offender profiling|criminal profile]],&lt;ref name="Team Killers"&gt;{{cite book |title=Team Killers: A Comparative Study of Collaborative Criminals |year=2001 |first=Jennifer |last=Furio |isbn=1892941635 |publisher=Algora Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RQYntwuZs68C&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|135}} Bittaker was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] for five murders on March 24, 1981, and is currently on [[death row]] at [[San Quentin State Prison]].&lt;ref name=DeathRowList&gt;{{cite web |author=Division of Adult Operations|title=Death Row Tracking System Condemned Inmate List (Secure)|publisher=California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Capital_Punishment/docs/CondemnedInmateListSecure.pdf|date=July 5, 2011|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/dan-morain/article96800957.html|title=Lawrence Bittaker, a Most Depraved Killer, Twists Justice System|publisher=Sacramento Bee|last=Morain|first=Dan|date=August 20, 2016|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norris accepted a [[plea bargain]] whereby he agreed to testify against Bittaker and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on May 7, 1980, with possibility of [[parole]] after serving 30 years.

Bittaker and Norris became known as the "Tool Box Killers" due to the fact the majority of instruments used to torture and murder their victims, such as pliers, ice picks, and sledgehammers, were items normally stored inside a household [[toolbox]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Almanac'' {{ISBN|978-1-897-78404-4}} p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

===Lawrence Bittaker===
Lawrence Sigmund Bittaker was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, on September 27, 1940, as the unwanted child of a couple who had chosen to not have children.&lt;ref name="Furio"&gt;{{cite book |last=Furio |first=Jennifer |year=1998 |title=The Serial Killer Letters |publisher=The Charles Press |isbn=0-914783-84-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}} Bittaker was placed in an orphanage by his natural mother and was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. George Bittaker as an infant. Bittaker's adoptive father worked in the aviation industry, which required the family to frequently move around the United States throughout his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/bittaker_norris/2.html|title=truTV - Reality TV - Comedy|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626162314/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/bittaker_norris/2.html|archive-date=June 26, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bittaker was first arrested for shoplifting at the age of 12 and obtained a minor criminal record over the next four years after further arrests for the same offense—in addition to petty theft—which brought him to the attention of juvenile authorities. Bittaker would later claim these numerous theft-related offenses committed throughout his adolescence had been attempts to compensate for the lack of love he received from his parents.&lt;ref name="Markman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Markman |first1=Ronald |last2=Bosco |first2=Dominick |year=1989 |title=Alone with The Devil |publisher=Piatkus Publishing |isbn=0-7499-1002-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250}}

Although reported to have an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 138, Bittaker considered school a tedious experience and dropped out of high school in 1957.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|257}} By this stage in his adolescence, he and his adoptive parents were living in California. Within a year of dropping out, he had been arrested for car theft, a [[hit and run]], and evading arrest.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|250}} For these offenses he was imprisoned at the [[California Division of Juvenile Justice|California Youth Authority]], where he remained until he was 18 years old.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|250}} Upon release, Bittaker discovered his adoptive parents had disowned him and had relocated to another state. He would never see his adoptive parents again.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|250}}&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

===Roy Norris===
Roy Lewis Norris was born in [[Greeley, Colorado|Greeley]], Colorado, on February 5, 1948.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|74}} Norris was conceived out of wedlock; his parents had married to avoid the social stigma surrounding illegitimate birth at the time.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|74–77}}

Norris' family lived within a short distance of his parents' home due to his grandfather's real estate investments.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|74}} His father worked in a scrapyard and his mother was a drug-addicted housewife. He occasionally lived with his parents throughout his childhood and adolescence but was repeatedly placed in the care of foster families throughout the state of Colorado.&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|136}}

Norris' childhood recollections are interspersed with memories of wrongful accusations while living with his biological parents, and being neglected by many of the foster families he lived with, frequently being denied sufficient food or clothing. He also claims he was sexually abused when in the care of a Hispanic family and later went on to state that this is where his prejudice towards Hispanics originates from.&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|136}}

While living with his birth parents at the age of 16, Norris visited the home of a female relative who was in her early twenties and began speaking to her in a sexually suggestive manner. She ordered him to leave her house and informed Norris' father, who threatened to subject him to a beating. Norris subsequently stole his father's car and drove into the [[Rocky Mountains]], where he attempted to commit suicide by injecting pure air into an artery in his arm.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|76}} He was later apprehended as a runaway, and returned to live with his parents. Upon his return home, Norris's parents informed him that he and his younger sister were unwanted children and that they intended to divorce when both reached adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Serial Killer Letters'' {{ISBN|978-0-914-78384-8}} p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later Norris dropped out of school and joined the [[United States Navy]]. He was stationed in [[San Diego]] in 1965 and was deployed to [[Vietnam]] in 1969, although he did not see active combat during his four-month tour of duty.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|253}} While stationed in Vietnam, he experimented with [[heroin]] and [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], becoming a regular user of the latter. He was [[Military discharge#Honorable|honorably discharge]]d from the Navy after one tour of duty.&lt;ref&gt;''The Serial Killer Letters'' {{ISBN|978-0-914-78384-8}} p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==First offenses==

===Bittaker===
Within days of his parole from the California Youth Authority, Bittaker was arrested for transporting a stolen vehicle across state lines.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|250}} In August 1959, Bittaker was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, to be served in the [[Oklahoma State Reformatory]]. He was later transferred to the medical center for federal prisoners in [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]], Missouri, to serve the remainder of his sentence.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|250–251}}

In 1960, Bittaker was released from prison and soon reverted to crime. Within months of his release, he had been arrested in Los Angeles for robbery and, in May 1961, was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. While incarcerated for this robbery, he was diagnosed by a [[psychiatrist]] as being highly [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]]. The psychiatrist also described Bittaker as "having considerable concealed hostility."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|251}}

Bittaker was released on parole in 1963 after completing two years of his sentence. In October 1964, he was again imprisoned for parole violation. In 1966, Bittaker underwent further examinations by two independent psychiatrists, both of whom classified him as a borderline psychopath: a highly manipulative individual unable to acknowledge the consequences of his actions.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|251–252}} Bittaker explained to one of them that his criminal activities gave him a feeling of self-importance, although he insisted circumstantial matters pertaining to his environment and upbringing decreased his ability to resist committing crimes. Bittaker was prescribed anti-psychotic medication. A year later, he was again released into society.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|251–252}}

A month after his parole in July 1967, Bittaker was again arrested and convicted of theft and of leaving the scene of an accident. He was sentenced to five years but was released in April 1970. In March 1971, Bittaker was again arrested for burglary. Due to repeated parole violations, he was sentenced to 6 months to 15 years' imprisonment in October 1971.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|251}} Three years later, Bittaker was again released from prison.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|251}}

In 1974, Bittaker was arrested for assault with attempt to commit murder, after he stabbed a young supermarket employee who had accused him of stealing. The supermarket employee had observed Bittaker stealing a steak and had followed Bittaker outside and into the store's parking lot, where he calmly asked Bittaker whether he had forgotten to pay. Bittaker responded by stabbing his pursuer in the chest, narrowly missing his heart. He attempted to flee but was quickly restrained by two other supermarket employees.&lt;ref name="Justia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/california/cal3d/48/1046.html|title=People v. Bittaker (1989)|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The employee, Gary Louie, survived the stabbing, and Bittaker was convicted of the lesser charge of assault with a deadly weapon&lt;ref&gt;''Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit'' {{ISBN|978-0-684-80376-0}} p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; and sent to [[California Men's Colony]] in [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]].&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|252}}

===Norris===
In November 1969, Roy Norris was arrested for his first known sexual offenses: he was charged with both rape and assault with attempt to commit rape.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|253}} In the latter incident, he had attempted to force his way into the car of a lone woman. Three months later, in February 1970, Norris attempted to deceive a lone woman into allowing him to enter her home. When the woman refused, he attempted to break into her house; the woman phoned the police, who arrested Norris before he had the opportunity to cause the woman any harm.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|253}}

Less than three months after this offense, Norris was diagnosed by [[Military psychology|military psychologists]] with a severe [[Schizoid personality disorder|schizoid personality]].&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|253}}&lt;ref name="TruTV.com. p.3"/&gt; He was given an administrative discharge from the Navy under terms labeled as psychological problems.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|267}}&lt;ref name="TruTV.com. p.3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/bittaker_norris/3.html|title=truTV - Reality TV - Comedy|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626180643/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/bittaker_norris/3.html|archive-date=June 26, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1970, Norris—on bail for his latest offense—attacked a female student whom he had been stalking on the grounds of the [[San Diego State University]] campus. Norris repeatedly struck her on the back of the head with a rock until she slumped to her knees before he repeatedly beat her head against the sidewalk as he knelt upon her lower back. Shortly thereafter, Norris was charged with assault with a deadly weapon; he was committed to a total of five years' imprisonment at the [[Atascadero State Hospital]], where he was classified as a mentally disordered sex offender.&lt;ref&gt;''Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder'' {{ISBN|978-1-483-35072-1}} p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Norris was released from the Atascadero State Hospital in 1975, with five years' probation, having been declared by doctors as an individual who was of "no further danger to others".&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|254}}&lt;ref name="TruTV.com. p.3"/&gt; Just three months after his release, Norris approached a 27-year-old woman walking home from a restaurant in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] and offered her a ride on his motorcycle. When she declined, Norris parked his motorcycle and grabbed the woman's scarf, twisting it around her neck, before informing her he intended to rape her&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|254}} and dragging her into nearby bushes. Fearing for her life, the woman did not resist the rape.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|254}}

Although the rape was reported to police, they were initially unable to find the perpetrator. However, one month later, the victim observed Norris' motorcycle and noted the license number, which she immediately gave to police. Norris was arrested for the rape; one year later, he was tried and convicted for this offense&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|264}} and sent to the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. While incarcerated at the California Men's Colony, Norris met and befriended Lawrence Bittaker.&lt;ref name="True Detective"&gt;{{cite book |title=True Detective |date=February 2011 |issn=0262-4133 |url=https://www.truecrimelibrary.com/product/true-detective-february-2011/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}

==Acquaintance==
[[File:California Mens Colony CDCR.jpg|right|thumb|[[California Men's Colony]], where Bittaker and Norris first became acquainted; discovering a common interest in [[sexual violence]].]]
Bittaker and Norris initially became loosely acquainted in 1977, one year after Norris arrived at San Luis Obispo. Bittaker's initial impression of Norris upon his arrival at the California Men's Colony was that he was a savvy individual, who largely associated with hardened criminals from motorcycle gangs, in addition to dealing in contraband drugs.&lt;ref name="True Detective"&gt;{{cite book |title=True Detective |date=February 2011 |issn=0262-4133 |url=https://www.truecrimelibrary.com/product/true-detective-february-2011/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}} The pair gradually became more closely acquainted, and only began talking in friendly terms when Norris taught Bittaker how to construct jewelry.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|44}}

According to Norris, Bittaker saved him from being attacked by fellow inmates on at least two occasions. By 1978,&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|253}} the pair had become close acquaintances; discovering they shared a common interest in sexual violence and [[misogyny]], with Norris also divulging to Bittaker the biggest stimulation for him was of seeing frightened young women, adding this was the primary reason he had amassed a lengthy record for sexual offenses.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|42}} Bittaker—who is not known to have committed any sexual offenses prior to his meeting Norris—himself divulged to Norris that if he ever raped a woman, he would kill her so as not to leave a witness to the crime.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|254}}

When alone, the pair regularly discussed plans to assault and murder teenage girls once they were freed. This shared fantasy evolved into an elaborate plan to murder one girl of each teenage year from 13 through 19.&lt;ref name="TruTV.com. p.3"/&gt; The pair vowed to become reacquainted once they were released.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia Of Serial Killers'' {{ISBN|978-0-7472-5361-7}} p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Bittaker was released from the California Men's Colony on October 15, 1978; he returned to Los Angeles and found work as a skilled machinist. This work earned Bittaker close to $1,000 a week, and despite classifying himself as a loner, he became friendly with several people in his neighborhood,&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|44}} earning a reputation as a generous and helpful individual who occasionally donated money to [[The Salvation Army]].&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|85}} On one occasion, he is known to have purchased large quantities of fast food and wine which he then handed to homeless individuals in [[Downtown Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|85}}

Bittaker was particularly popular amongst the local teenagers, and later admitted the primary reason he always had beer and marijuana in his [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] motel was that his residence would remain a popular place for teenagers to socialize.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|44}}

Three months after Bittaker was released from the California Men's Colony, on January 15, 1979, Norris was released from prison and moved into his mother's home in Redondo Beach. He soon found employment as an electrician in [[Compton, California|Compton]].&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|85}} Shortly thereafter, he received a letter from Bittaker.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|255}} In late February, the pair met at a hotel and rekindled their plan to kidnap and rape girls.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|255}}

In order for the pair to be able to successfully abduct teenage girls, Bittaker decided they would need a van as opposed to a car. With financial assistance from Norris,&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|136}} Bittaker purchased a silver 1977 [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] cargo van in February 1979. The vehicle was windowless on the sides and had a large passenger-side sliding door. According to Bittaker, when viewing this sliding door, he realized he or Norris could "pull up [to a teenage girl] real close and not have to open the doors all the way."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|255}} Bittaker and Norris would nickname this van "Murder Mac".&lt;ref&gt;''Murders in the United States: Crimes, Killers and Victims of the Twentieth'' {{ISBN|0-786-42075-8}} p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
From February to June 1979, Bittaker and Norris picked up over 20 female hitchhikers.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|255}} The pair did not assault these girls in any manner: these practice runs were merely a way for them to develop ruses to lure girls into the van voluntarily and of discovering secluded locations.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|255}} In late April, the pair discovered a secluded [[Firebreak|fire road]] located in the [[San Gabriel Mountains]]. Bittaker broke the locked gate to this fire road with a crowbar and replaced the lock with one he owned.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|255–256}}

===Lucinda Lynn Schaefer===
Bittaker and Norris killed their first victim, 16-year-old Lucinda Lynn Schaefer, on June 24, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.websleuths.com/forums/showthread.php?t=50676|title=Deceased/Not Found CA - Lucinda Schaefer, 17, Torrance, 24 June 1979 *Bittaker &amp; Norris guilty*|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schaefer was last seen leaving a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] meeting in Redondo Beach. In his written accounts of the events of this day, Bittaker stated he and Norris first finished constructing the bed the pair had installed in the rear of the van, beneath which they placed tools, clothes and a cooler filled with beer and soft drinks. At approximately 11 a.m., the pair drove to "the beach area, drinking beer, smoking [[marijuana|grass]] and flirting with girls. We had no set routine."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|256}}

At approximately 7:46&amp;nbsp;p.m.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findthemissing.org/cases/case_report_html/4571|title=NamUs - National Missing Persons Data System Case Report - 4571|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris spotted Schaefer walking down a side street and remarked to Bittaker, "There's a cute little blonde."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|256}}

[[File:San Gabriel Mountains 1, CA.JPG|right|thumb|The [[San Gabriel Mountains]]. Bittaker and Norris murdered and discarded the bodies of four of their victims at this location.]]
After unsuccessfully attempting to entice Schaefer into their van with alternative offers of marijuana and a lift home, Bittaker and Norris drove further ahead and parked alongside a driveway. Norris then exited the vehicle, opened the passenger-side sliding door, and leaned into the van, with his head and shoulders obscured from view behind the door. When Lucinda Schaefer passed the van, Norris exchanged a few words with her before dragging her into the van and closing the door. Using a ruse they would repeat in most of their subsequent murders, Bittaker turned the radio to full volume as Norris bound the victim's arms and legs and gagged her with duct tape as Bittaker drove Schaefer to the fire road in the San Gabriel Mountains where, in April, the pair had previously switched the locks.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|257}}

Despite initially screaming when she was abducted, Lucinda Schaefer quickly regained her composure. In his written account of the night that followed, Bittaker wrote that Lucinda Schaefer "displayed a magnificent state of self-control and composed acceptance of the conditions of which she had no control. She shed no tears, offered no resistance and expressed no great concern for her safety&amp;nbsp;... I guess she knew what was coming."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|257}}

At the fire road, Norris first raped Schaefer after instructing Bittaker to "go take a walk" and return in one hour. Upon returning to the van, Bittaker similarly raped the girl in Norris' absence. Upon the second occasion in which she was raped by Norris in Bittaker's absence, Schaefer asked him whether they intended to kill her, to which Norris replied, "No." In response, Schaefer requested to be allowed time to pray before she was killed if that was Bittaker and Norris' intention.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/1989109448Cal3d1046_11056.xml/PEOPLE%20v.%20BITTAKER|title=PEOPLE v. BITTAKER - 48 Cal.3d 1046 (1989) - Leagle.com|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their subsequent accounts of the actual murder, Bittaker and Norris have given differing accounts as to who argued over whether they should kill her rather than release her: each stated the other argued that they should kill her.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|259}} In any event, Schaefer pleaded for "only a second, to pray,"&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|137}} before Norris attempted to manually strangle her. After approximately 45 seconds, he became disturbed at "the look in her eyes"&lt;ref name="Gadsden Times Mar. 19, 1980"&gt;{{cite news|title=Man faces 45 years in killings|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=19800319&amp;id=6aIfAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3911,3354844|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[The Gadsden Times]]|page=20|agency=Associated Press|date=March 19, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ran to the front of the van, vomiting. Bittaker then manually strangled Schaefer until she collapsed to the ground and began [[convulsion|convulsing]]. He then twisted a wire coat hanger around her neck with [[Locking pliers|vise-grip pliers]] until Schaefer's convulsions ceased. Lucinda Schaefer was denied her requests to pray before Bittaker and Norris killed her.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Crime Classification Manual: A Standard System for Investigating and Classifying Violent Crime'' {{ISBN|978-1-897-78404-4}} p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucinda Schaefer's body was wrapped in a plastic shower curtain and thrown over a steep canyon Bittaker had selected. According to Norris, after Bittaker had thrown Schaefer over the canyon, Bittaker assured him "the animals would eat her up, so there wouldn't be any evidence left."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|258}}

===Andrea Joy Hall===
On July 8, 1979, two weeks after the murder of Lucinda Schaefer, Bittaker and Norris encountered 18-year-old Andrea Joy Hall hitchhiking along the [[California State Route 1|Pacific Coast Highway]].&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|258}} As the pair slowed the van to offer Hall a lift, another vehicle pulled over and offered Hall exactly that, which she accepted. Bittaker and Norris followed the vehicle from a distance until Hall exited the vehicle in Redondo Beach.&lt;ref name="Farr1980"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farr|first1=Bill|title=Girls' killer tells a gruesome story|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19800319&amp;id=4y8dAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6593,4087049|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|page=27|date=March 19, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1977 Chevrolet van (5879255416).jpg|left|thumb|A 1977 Chevrolet van with sliding door. Bittaker and Norris used a windowless [[Chevrolet van#Third generation (1971–1995)|GMC Vandura]] model similar to this van when committing their abductions.]]
On this occasion, Norris hid in the back of the van in order to dupe Hall into thinking Bittaker was alone. Inside the van, Bittaker offered Hall a soft drink from the cooler located in the rear of the van. Norris pounced on her when she went to retrieve it and, after a strenuous fight, managed to subdue Hall by twisting her arm behind her back, causing her to scream in pain. Norris then gagged Hall with adhesive tape and bound her wrists and ankles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/bittaker_norris/5.html|title=truTV - Reality TV - Comedy|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626141808/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/bittaker_norris/5.html|archive-date=June 26, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bittaker and Norris drove Hall to a location in the San Gabriel Mountains beyond where they had taken Lucinda Schaefer. At this location, she was raped twice by Bittaker and once by Norris.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; While Bittaker was raping Hall for the second time, Norris saw what he believed to be vehicle headlights approaching. Bittaker clasped his hand over Hall's mouth and dragged her into nearby bushes as Norris drove in an unsuccessful search of the vehicle thought he had seen. When he returned, the pair drove to a location farther in the San Gabriel Mountains. Bittaker forced Hall to walk uphill naked alongside the road and to then perform oral sex on him, before ordering Hall to pose for several [[Instant camera|Polaroid]] pictures.&lt;ref name="Markman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Markman |first1=Ronald |last2=Bosco |first2=Dominick |year=1989 |title=Alone with The Devil |publisher=Piatkus Publishing |isbn=0-7499-1002-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|259}}

Bittaker and Norris drove Hall to a third location, where Bittaker again walked Hall up a nearby hill, this time as Norris drove to a nearby store to purchase alcohol. When Norris returned, Bittaker was alone and in possession of two further Polaroid pictures he had taken,&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; both of which depicted Hall's face in expressions Norris later described as being of "sheer terror" as she begged for her life to be spared.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|88}} Bittaker informed Norris that he had told Hall he was going to kill her and challenged her to give him as many reasons as she could come up with as to why she should be allowed to live, before thrusting an [[ice pick]] through her ear into her brain. He then turned her body over and thrust the ice pick into her other ear, stomping on it until the handle broke.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; Bittaker then strangled before throwing her body off a cliff.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|258–259}}

On September 3, Bittaker and Norris observed two girls named Jackie Doris Gilliam and Jacqueline Leah Lamp sitting on a bus stop bench located close to [[Hermosa Beach, California|Hermosa Beach]]. Lamp and Gilliam had been hitchhiking along the Pacific Coast Highway before Bittaker and Norris observed them as they were resting at the bus stop. Bittaker and Norris offered the girls a ride, which Gilliam and Lamp accepted. Inside the van, both girls were offered marijuana by Norris, which they accepted.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|259}}

Shortly after entering the van, both girls realized that Bittaker had steered the van off the Pacific Coast Highway and was driving in the direction of the San Gabriel Mountains. When the girls protested, both Bittaker and Norris attempted to allay the girls' concerns with excuses, which did not deceive either girl. Lamp, aged 13, attempted to open the sliding door, whereupon Norris hit her on the back of the head with a bag filled with lead weights,&lt;ref name="Justia.com"/&gt; briefly knocking her unconscious, before overpowering 15-year-old Jackie Gilliam. As he began to bind and gag Gilliam, Jacqueline Lamp regained consciousness and again attempted to flee the van, whereupon Norris twisted her arm behind her back and dragged her back into the van. As this struggle ensued, Bittaker—noting the girls' struggle was in full view of potential witnesses—stopped the van, punched Gilliam in the face, and assisted Norris in finishing binding and gagging the two girls.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|260}}

Gilliam and Lamp were driven to the San Gabriel Mountains, where they were held captive for almost two days,&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|260}} being bound and gagged between repeated instances of sexual and physical abuse. Both men slept in the van alongside their two hostages, with each alternatively acting as a lookout. On one occasion, Bittaker walked Lamp onto a nearby hill and forced her to pose for pornographic pictures before returning her to the van. Bittaker also informed Norris to take several Polaroid pictures of himself and Gilliam, both nude and clothed. In the first of three instances in which Bittaker raped Gilliam, he also created a tape recording of himself raping her, forcing the girl to pretend she was his cousin&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|260}} and informing Gilliam to feel free to express her pain. (Bittaker later claimed he buried the tape in a cemetery. The tape recording of Gilliam's rape was never found.) Bittaker is also known to have tortured Gilliam by stabbing her breasts with an ice pick and using vise grip pliers to tear off part of one nipple.&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-supreme-court/1774155.html|title=The People, Plaintiff and Respondent, v. Lawrence Sigmond Bittaker, Defendant and Appellant|publisher=findlaw.com|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After almost two days of captivity, Lamp and Gilliam were murdered. At Bittaker's subsequent trial, Norris claimed he had suggested that Gilliam be killed quickly as, unlike Lamp, she had been largely cooperative throughout the period of her captivity, whereupon Bittaker replied, "No, they only die once anyway." Gilliam was struck in each ear with an ice pick, then strangled to death.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|41}}

After Bittaker had murdered Jackie Gilliam, he then forced Jacqueline Leah Lamp out of the van. Upon exiting the sliding door, Bittaker shouted to her: "You wanted to stay a virgin; now you can die a virgin!"&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"&gt;[http://murders.ru/Classific.pdf Crime Classification Manual]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|232}} before Norris struck her upon the head with a sledgehammer. Bittaker then strangled Lamp until he believed she had died; when Lamp opened her eyes,&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|260}} Norris again bludgeoned her repeatedly as Bittaker strangled her to death.&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

The bodies of Jackie Gilliam and Jacqueline Lamp were thrown over an embankment into the [[chaparral]].&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

===Shirley Lynette Ledford===
Bittaker and Norris abducted their final victim, 16-year-old Shirley Lynette Ledford, on October 31, 1979. Ledford was abducted as she stood outside a gas station;&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|252}} hitchhiking home from a Halloween party in the [[Sunland-Tujunga, Los Angeles|Sunland-Tujunga]] suburb of Los Angeles. Investigators believe Ledford accepted a ride home from Bittaker and Norris because she recognized Bittaker, as he is known to have frequented the restaurant in which Ledford held a part-time job as a waitress.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|85}}

Upon accepting the offer of a lift home and entering the van, Ledford was offered marijuana by Norris, which she refused.&lt;ref name="Farr1980"/&gt; Bittaker drove the van to a secluded street, where Norris drew a knife, then bound and gagged Ledford with [[Barricade tape|construction tape]].&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|258}}

Bittaker then traded places with Norris, who drove in an aimless manner for in excess of an hour as Bittaker remained with Ledford in the back of the van. After removing the construction tape from the girl's mouth and legs, Bittaker tormented Ledford: initially slapping and mocking her, then beating her with his fists as he repeatedly shouted for her to "say something", then, as Shirley Ledford began screaming, shouting for her to "scream louder". As Ledford continued screaming, Bittaker began asking her as he struck her: "What's the matter? Don't you like to scream?"&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|261}}

As Shirley Ledford began to cry, she pleaded with Bittaker, saying, "No, don't touch me." In response, Bittaker again ordered her to scream as loud as she wished, then began alternately striking her with a hammer, beating her breasts with his fists&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|232}} and torturing her with pliers both between and throughout instances when he raped and sodomized her. Repeatedly, Ledford can be heard pleading for the abuse to cease and making statements such as, "Oh no! No!"&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|262}} as sounds of Bittaker alternately extracting either the sledgehammer or the pliers from the toolbox can be heard on a tape recorder he had switched on after entering the rear of the van. Norris later described hearing "screams ... constant screams" emanating from the rear of the van as he drove.&lt;ref name="Farr1980"/&gt;

Shortly after Norris switched places with Bittaker, he himself switched on the tape recorder which Bittaker had used to record much of the time he had been in the rear of the van with Ledford.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; Norris first shouted for Ledford to: "Go ahead and scream or I'll make you scream."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|262}} In response, Ledford pleaded, "I'll scream if you stop hitting me," then emitted several high-pitched screams as Norris encouraged her to continue until he ordered her to stop.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|262}}

Norris then reached for the sledgehammer as Shirley Ledford—seeing him do this—screamed, "Oh no!" Norris then struck Ledford once upon the left elbow. In response, she informed Norris he had broken her elbow, before pleading, "Don't hit me again."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|262–263}} In response, Norris again raised the sledgehammer as Ledford repeatedly screamed, "No!" Norris then proceeded to strike Ledford 25 consecutive times upon the same elbow with the sledgehammer, before asking her, "What are you sniveling about?" as Ledford continuously screamed and wept.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|252}}

{{quote box
|quote  = We've all heard women scream in horror films ... still, we know that no-one is really screaming. Why? Simply because an actress can't produce some sounds that convince us that something vile and heinous is happening.

}}
After approximately two hours of captivity, Norris killed Ledford by strangling her with a wire coat hanger, which he tightened with pliers. Ledford did not react much to the act of strangulation, although she died with her eyes open.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|89}} Bittaker then opted to discard her body on a random lawn in order to view the reaction from the press. The pair drove to a randomly selected house in Sunland and discarded Ledford's body in a bed of ivy upon the front lawn.

Shirley Lynette Ledford's body was found by a jogger the following morning. An autopsy revealed that, in addition to having been sexually violated, she had died of strangulation after receiving extensive blunt-force trauma to the face, head, breasts, and left elbow, with her [[olecranon]] sustaining multiple fractures. Her genitalia and rectum had been torn, caused in part by Bittaker having inserted pliers inside her body.&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|233–234}} In addition, her left hand bore a puncture wound and a finger on her right hand had been slashed.&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|226}}&lt;ref name="Newton2006"/&gt;

Bittaker would later claim the tape recording the pair had created of Shirley Ledford's clear abuse and torture offered nothing other than the evidence of a threesome, adding that, towards the very end, Shirley Ledford was screaming for he and Norris to kill her.&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|139}}

==Investigation==
In November 1979, Roy Norris became reacquainted with a friend named Jimmy Dalton, an individual with whom he had previously been incarcerated at the California Men's Colony.&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|146}} Norris confided in this individual as to his and Bittaker's exploits over the previous five months, including graphic details of the murder of Shirley Ledford (the only victim whose body had been found at this time). Norris also divulged to Dalton that, in addition to the five murders he and Bittaker had committed, there had been three additional incidents in which he and Bittaker had abducted or attempted to abduct young women who had either successfully escaped their attackers or, in one instance, had actually been raped but released.&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|226}}

Upon hearing Norris's confessions, Dalton consulted his attorney, who advised him to inform authorities.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|264}} Dalton agreed, and he and his attorney informed the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], who in turn relayed the two men to the Redondo Beach police.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|264}}

A Redondo Beach Detective named Paul Bynum was assigned to investigate Dalton's claims as to Norris's confessions of the murders, attempted abductions, and rapes which he had confided to Dalton had occurred between June and October.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|264}} Bynum initially noted that Dalton's statements as to Norris's confessions did match reports on file of several teenage girls who had been [[missing person|reported missing]] over the previous five months.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|264}} In addition, the incident Norris had confided to Dalton where he claimed he and Bittaker had sprayed [[Mace (spray)|mace]] in the face of a woman, who had then been dragged into Bittaker's GMC van and raped by both men, matched a report filed in relation to an incident which occurred on September 30. In this filed report, a young woman named Robin Robeck had had mace sprayed in her face before being dragged into a van and raped by two Caucasian men in their mid-30s, before being released.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|263}} Although Robeck had reported the abduction and rape to police, they had been unable to identify her assailants.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|263–264}}

Bynum dispatched an investigator to visit Robin Robeck at her residence in [[Oregon]], to show her a series of mug shots. Without hesitation, Robeck positively identified two photos presented to her as those of the men who had kidnapped and raped her on September 30. The two individuals she identified were Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|264}}

==Arrest==
Upon linking Bittaker and Norris to the rape of Robin Robeck, the Hermosa Beach police placed Roy Norris under [[surveillance]];&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|263}} within days, they had observed his dealing in marijuana. On November 20, 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Girls Marked for Murder?|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19800216&amp;id=Af8hAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2651,309156|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|agency=Associated Press|date=February 16, 1980|pages=1A, 2A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris was arrested by the Hermosa Beach police for parole violation. The same day, at the Burbank motel where he resided, Bittaker was arrested for the rape of Robin Robeck.&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/48/1046.html ''law.justia.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Robeck had been able to identify mug shots of Bittaker and Norris, in a police lineup she was unable to positively identify her assailants.&lt;ref name="Newton2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Michael|title=The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwNVbOcTncwC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=October 16, 2017|date=February 2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6987-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, police had observed Norris dealing in marijuana, whereas Bittaker had been in possession of drugs at the time of his arrest. Both were held on charges of parole violation.&lt;ref&gt;''Couples Who Kill: Profiles of Deviant Duos'' {{ISBN|0-74908-357-3}} p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

A search of Bittaker's apartment revealed several Polaroid photographs which were determined as depicting Andrea Joy Hall and Jackie Gilliam—both of whom had been reported as missing earlier the same year. Inside Bittaker's van, investigators discovered a sledgehammer, a plastic bag filled with lead weights, a book detailing how to locate police radio frequencies,&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; a jar of Vaseline, two necklaces (later confirmed as belonging to two of the victims) and a tape recording of a young woman in obvious distress; screaming and pleading for mercy while in the process of torture and sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="Newton2006"/&gt; The mother of Shirley Lynette Ledford—named by Jimmy Dalton as being one of the women whom Norris had confessed he and Bittaker had killed—identified the voice on the tape as being that of her only daughter; the voices of the two men mocking and threatening Shirley Ledford in the process of her torture and abuse were identified as being Roy Norris and Lawrence Bittaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Girl Begs for Mercy on Recording of Rape and Torture in Los Angeles|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19800215&amp;id=V2dQAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5121,4024715|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Evening Independent]]|agency=Associated Press|date=February 15, 1980|page=2A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also found in Bittaker's motel were seven bottles of various acidic materials. (Investigators would later discover Bittaker planned to use these acidic materials upon their next victim.)&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

Inside Norris's apartment, police discovered a bracelet he had taken from Shirley Ledford's body as a souvenir. Also found at the homes of both Bittaker and Norris were Polaroid pictures of almost 500 teenage girls and young women, most of which had apparently been taken at Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach,&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|41}} with others taken by Bittaker at a Burbank high school. Most of these pictures had been taken without the girls' knowledge or consent.&lt;ref name="Newton2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Michael|title=The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwNVbOcTncwC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=October 16, 2017|date=February 2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6987-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|41}}

===Confession===
On November 30, 1979, Norris attended a [[preliminary hearing]] in relation to the September 30 rape. By this stage, Norris was beginning to display visible signs of stress.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|265}} At the hearing, Norris waived his [[Miranda warning|Miranda rights]], before Detective Bynum and Deputy District Attorney Stephen Kay began questioning him, initially in relation to the rape of Robin Robeck; then in relation to the statements given to police by Jimmy Dalton and the evidence recovered from his and Bittaker's residences.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|264–265}}

Initially, Norris flatly denied any involvement in any murders, rapes or disappearances; however, when confronted with the evidence investigators had compiled, Norris began to confess, although he did attempt to portray Bittaker as being more [[culpability|culpable]] in the murders than himself. In what Bynum and Kay later described as a "casual, unconcerned manner,"&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|266}} Norris divulged that he and Bittaker had been in the habit of driving around areas such as the Pacific Coast Highway and randomly approaching girls whom they found attractive with offers of a ride, posing with the pair for photographs,&lt;ref name="Newton2006"/&gt; or marijuana. Most of those whom they approached rejected whatever given ruse Bittaker and Norris used to entice them into the van; although four girls had accepted lifts from the pair and had been murdered, with a fifth victim—their first—being grabbed by force.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|257}}

Inside the van, the girls would typically be overpowered, bound hand and foot, gagged, and driven to locations deep within the San Gabriel Mountains, where they would be sexually assaulted by both men, then usually killed by strangulation with a wire coat hanger,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; although two of the victims had had ice picks driven into their ears before being strangled. Norris admitted to bludgeoning their youngest victim, Jacqueline Leah Lamp, about the head with a sledgehammer as Bittaker strangled her, and admitted to repeatedly striking Shirley Ledford upon the elbow with a sledgehammer before strangling her to death. The bottles of acid found at Bittaker's motel, Norris stated, were intended for use upon the next victim they abducted.&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

According to Norris, the level of brutality Bittaker had exhibited towards their victims had increased on each successive instance they had successfully lured a girl into the van: their final victim, Shirley Ledford, had actually pleaded to be killed in order that her agony could cease. Additional details provided by Norris provided further [[corroborating evidence]] to support his confessions. For example, he knew that their first victim, Lucinda Schaefer, had left a meeting at a Presbyterian Church shortly before she was abducted and that Schaefer had lost one shoe as she had been dragged into Bittaker's van. Norris also knew part of Shirley Ledford's ancestry was Hispanic, and that Bittaker had unsuccessfully asked her to date him prior to October 1979.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|85}}

In a press statement relating to the police investigation into the murders issued on February 7, 1980, Los Angeles County Sheriff [[Peter J. Pitchess|Peter Pitchess]] stated the victims had been subjected to "[[wikt:sadism|sadistic]] and barbaric abuse,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recordings link two to brutal sex slayings|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=19800210&amp;id=aaMfAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1870,2643728|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=The Gadsden Times|agency=Associated Press|date=February 10, 1980|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that five charges of [[first-degree murder]] would be sought against both Bittaker and Norris. Sheriff Pitchess also stated that, in relation to the Polaroid pictures found in Bittaker and Norris's apartments, police had located 60 of the young women depicted—none of whom had been harmed.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|42}}

Nonetheless, Pitchess also stated that police had also identified 19 of the women depicted in the pictures as being individuals who had been reported missing,&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Pictorial History of World Crime, Volume 2'' {{ISBN|978-1-442-23843-5}} p. 718&lt;/ref&gt; and that these teenage girls and young women may well have been murdered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gillott|first1=Roger|title=Were 500 marked for death?|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19800218&amp;id=0Z0rAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4015,3660802|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph]]|agency=Associated Press|date=February 18, 1980|location=[[Nashua, New Hampshire]]|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Pitchess did stress that they had no conclusive evidence to suggest that these additional 19 women photographed had fallen victim to Bittaker and Norris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disappearance of 40 girls investigated|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=19800216&amp;id=ErgzAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=981,1519107|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]]|agency=[[UPI]]|date=February 16, 1980|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the individuals depicted in the Polaroid pictures seized from Bittaker and Norris depicts an unidentified young white woman, alone with Bittaker and Norris, in circumstances very similar to the pictures found depicting known victims Andrea Hall, Jacqueline Leah Lamp, and Jackie Gilliam. The young woman in the pictures has never been identified. This photograph is indicative there may have been one further victim&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|234}} whom neither Bittaker or Norris have ever mentioned to investigators.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|42}}

===Search of San Gabriel Mountains===
Norris agreed to return to the San Gabriel Mountains to search for the bodies of the girls to whose abduction and murder he had confessed to assisting in. In each instance, Norris brought detectives to the area where he and Bittaker had disposed of their victims' bodies. Despite extensive searches of the areas where he stated the bodies of Lucinda Schaefer and Andrea Hall had been discarded, their bodies were never found. Nonetheless, on February 9, 1980,&lt;ref&gt;[http://vitals.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ca/death/search.cgi/search.cgi California Death Records. Gilliam, Jackie Doris.]&lt;/ref&gt; the skeletalized bodies of Jacqueline Leah Lamp and Jackie Doris Gilliam were found at the bottom of a canyon, alongside a dry river bed.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|266}} The bodies were scattered over an area measuring hundreds of feet in diameter. An ice pick was still lodged in the skull of Jackie Gilliam;&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|260}} the skull of Jacqueline Leah Lamp bore multiple indentations—evidence of the numerous hammer blows Norris had stated he inflicted.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'' {{ISBN|0-816-06987-5}} pp. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wpdms shdrlfi020l san gabriel mountains.jpg|205px|right|thumb|The [[San Gabriel Mountains]]. Norris was able to lead investigators to the bodies of two of the four victims he and Bittaker had murdered at this location.]]
In February 1980, Norris and Bittaker were formally charged with the murders of the five girls.&lt;ref name="MarkedForMurder"&gt;{{cite news|title=Were Young Girls Marked for Murder?|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19800216&amp;id=VoIsAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6200,2826929|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]|agency=Associated Press|date=February 16, 1980|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[arraignment]], Bittaker was denied bail, whereas Norris's bail was set at $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rape-torture-murder plot claims at least five girls' lives|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19800216&amp;id=lbssAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6992,3054781|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Wilmington Morning Star]]|agency=Associated Press|date=February 16, 1980|page=4A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within one month of his being charged with murder, Norris had accepted a plea bargain in which he would testify against Bittaker in return for the prosecution agreeing not to seek the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] against him.&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

==Guilty plea==
On March 18, 1980, Roy Norris pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder; one count of second-degree murder (in relation to victim Andrea Joy Hall),&lt;ref name="Gadsden Times Mar. 19, 1980"/&gt; two counts of rape, and one count of robbery. Formal sentencing was postponed until May 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guilty in torture murder|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1982&amp;dat=19800319&amp;id=RVpGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2186,2694929|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=The Evening News|agency=Associated Press|date=March 19, 1980|location=[[Newburgh, New York]]|page=5A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In return for Norris's agreeing to plead guilty and to testify against Lawrence Bittaker, prosecutors had agreed to seek neither the death penalty nor life without parole at the upcoming sentencing hearing.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|266}}

Prior to his May 7 sentencing, Norris was reviewed by a probation officer who testified at his sentencing that Norris had again accused Bittaker of the actual torture of their victims, and that for Norris himself, the feeling of power and the dominance he had over the victims was the main overriding factor, as opposed to having sexual intercourse with them.&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|266}} The parole officer added that Norris "never exhibited any remorse or compassion about his brutal acts towards the victims ... the defendant appears compulsive in his need to desire to inflict pain and torture upon women." In conclusion, the probation officer testified that Norris "can realistically be regarded as an extreme [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]], whose depraved pattern of behavior is beyond rehabilitation."&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|266}}

On May 7, 1980, Roy Norris was sentenced to 45 years to life imprisonment, with eligibility for parole from 2010.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia Of Serial Killers'' {{ISBN|978-0-7472-5361-7}} p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arraignment===
On April 24, 1980, Lawrence Bittaker was arraigned on a total of 29 charges of kidnapping, rape, sodomy, and murder in addition to various charges of [[criminal conspiracy]] and possession of a firearm.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|42}} He was also charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit murder dating from December 1979 in which he had unsuccessfully attempted to persuade two inmates due to be released to murder Robin Robeck in order to prevent her from testifying against him at his upcoming trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pleas given in 5 slayings|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=19800429&amp;id=_RQ0AAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3376,7110894|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=Lodi News-Sentinel|agency=UPI|date=April 29, 1980|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges for the rape of Robin Robeck would later be dropped because of a lack of physical evidence as well as Robeck's failing to identify her attackers in a lineup.&lt;ref name="MarkedForMurder"/&gt;

When asked by Judge William Hollingsworth as to how he pleaded, Bittaker remained silent—refusing to answer any questions.&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|42}} In response, the judge entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/01/19/Trial-begins-in-sex-torture-case/5475348728400/|title=Trial Begins in Sex-torture Case|publisher=UPI.com|date=August 19, 1981|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|42}}

==Trial==
The trial of Lawrence Bittaker began on January 19, 1981.&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|226}} He was tried in [[Torrance, California|Torrance]] before Judge Thomas Fredericks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trial of Accused Pliers Killer Begins Today |date=January 5, 1981 |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/01/05/Trial-of-accused-pliers-killer-begins-today/7082347518800/ |publisher=UPI.com |accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The star witness to appear for the prosecution at the trial of Lawrence Bittaker was Roy Norris,&lt;ref name="MorningNews1981"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jury recommends death sentence for Bittaker|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&amp;dat=19810223&amp;id=qAIdAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4293,3287036|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=Morning News|agency=Associated Press|date=February 23, 1981|location=[[Bowling Green, Kentucky]]|page=6A}}&lt;/ref&gt; who began his testimony on January 22. Norris testified as to how he became acquainted with Bittaker in jail, and how the pair had formulated a plan to kidnap, rape and kill teenage girls. Responding to questions from the prosecutor, Norris stated that in June 1979, he had unsuccessfully attempted to abduct and rape a woman, who escaped unharmed.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; When he informed Bittaker of this incident, they both agreed to act together on all future abductions.&lt;ref name="Spokane Daily Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|title=Teen girls' deaths bring 'guilty' ruling|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&amp;dat=19810218&amp;id=zPpLAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6628,768455|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=Spokane Daily Chronicle|agency=Associated Press|date=February 18, 1981|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|254}}

Norris then chronologically recounted for the court the details of each of the five murders he and Bittaker had committed in addition to the September 30, 1979 rape of Robin Robeck, the attempted abduction of a woman named Jan Malin, which had also occurred on September 30, and the attempted abduction of an unidentified young woman on September 27.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt;

In reference to the actual murders, Norris stated that after he unsuccessfully attempted to strangle Lucinda Schaefer, Bittaker had strangled her with a wire coat hanger. The pair had then thrown her body into a location at or near the San Dimas Canyon.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In reference to the murder of Andrea Hall, Norris stated he had been told by Bittaker to drive to a nearby store to purchase alcohol when Hall was murdered, after which he returned to find Bittaker, smiling and holding Polaroid pictures he had taken of Hall after informing her he intended to kill her. With reference to victims Jacqueline Lamp and Jackie Gilliam, Norris stated that the two girls were held captive for "over a day" before being murdered, adding that Bittaker had killed Gilliam before he himself bludgeoned Lamp about the head as Bittaker strangled her. When discussing the abuse and torture of Shirley Lynette Ledford, Norris stated he had, upon the insistence of Bittaker, committed the actual murder of Ledford, adding Bittaker had informed him that "I should kill her, because I hadn't killed anyone yet. I knew this was coming, so I agreed." Norris then confessed to having killed Ledford by strangling her with a coat hanger, which he had tightened with pliers in much the same manner Bittaker had with previous victims Lucinda Schaefer and Jacqueline Lamp. Norris then stated the pair had driven to Sunland, where he discarded Shirley Ledford's body upon the front lawn as Bittaker waited in his van.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|89}}

Several witnesses testified as to Bittaker having shown them pictures of the victims he had retained as keepsakes and which had been found in his motel. One witness, a 17-year-old neighbor of Bittaker's named Christina Dralle, testified that Bittaker had shown her a Polaroid picture he had taken of Jackie Gilliam before stating, "The girls I get won't talk anymore."&lt;ref name="Justia.com"/&gt; Another witness to testify was an individual named Lloyd Douglas, who had shared a jail cell with Bittaker following his November 1979 arrest. Douglas testified that Bittaker had discussed in detail the torture he had inflicted on victims Jackie Gilliam and Shirley Ledford, stating Bittaker had informed him he had stabbed one of Gilliam's breasts with an ice pick, which he then twisted as the tool remained inserted in the wound;&lt;ref name="Justia.com"/&gt; he had also "pinched" Gilliam on the legs and breasts with a vise grip, before tearing off part of one nipple.&lt;ref name="Justia.com"/&gt; Douglas also stated Bittaker had informed him he had "pulled on" the genitals and breasts of Shirley Ledford with the same instrument, and that he had attempted to beat her breasts "back into her chest."&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|232}}

The defense contended that Norris was the actual perpetrator of the murders and that Bittaker had only become aware of Norris's activities shortly before his arrest when Norris had informed him he had murdered several girls with whom they had both encountered and engaged in sexual activities. To support their case, the defense produced a friend of Norris named Richard Shoopman, who testified as to Norris's repeatedly divulging to him his desire to rape young girls.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; Shoopman also testified that Norris had informed him that the look of [[acute stress reaction|shock]] and fear on the face of a young girl was a prime sexual stimulus for him. In support of Bittaker's case, the defense also harked to the Polaroid images taken of the facial expressions of Andrea Hall, and of Bittaker's statements as to Norris's revelations to Bittaker regarding his prime sexual stimulations while both were incarcerated at the California Men's Colony in 1977.&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

[[File:Shirley Lynette Ledford Sunland-Tujunga 1979.jpg|upright|thumb|Shirley Lynette Ledford. The audio recording of her abuse at Bittaker's hands was the most damning evidence presented at his trial.]]
The most damning evidence presented at Bittaker's trial was a 17-minute section of the audio tape the pair had created of Shirley Lynette Ledford's abuse and torment. The audiotape, which had been found inside Bittaker's van and which Norris had earlier testified Bittaker had repeatedly played as he drove in the weeks prior to his arrest—adding that Bittaker considered the contents to be "real funny"&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|42}}—was presented in evidence on January 29, with Stephen Kay forewarning the jury: "For those of you who do not know what hell is like, you will find out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/01/29/A-stunned-jury-in-the-murder-trial-of-Lawrence/3810349592400/ |title=A Stunned Jury in the Murder Trial of Lawrence Bittaker |publisher=upi.com |date=January 29, 1981 |accessdate=September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Judge Fredericks had earlier denied motions by the defense to omit the tape recording from admission as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jury asks death penalty|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&amp;dat=19810222&amp;id=lp5OAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2387,1880312|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=The Prescott Courier|agency=Associated Press|date=February 22, 1981|page=2A}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

More than 100 people were present in the courtroom as the tape was played, and many members of both the jury and the audience wept openly upon hearing the contents, with several members of the audience either burying their heads in their hands, dabbing tears from their eyes or rushing out of the courtroom before the tape had finished.&lt;ref name="The Evening Independent 1981"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jurors, Lawyers Weep at Taped Screams of Victim|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19810130&amp;id=fGFQAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3483,4536403|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=Evening Independent|agency=Associated Press|date=January 30, 1981|page=2A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bittaker was undisturbed at hearing the contents of the tape—smiling throughout the hearing of the recording.&lt;ref&gt;C''ouples who Kill'' {{ISBN|978-0-7490-8175-1}} p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of two instances throughout the trial when prosecutor Stephen Kay was reduced to tears,&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|267}} he walked out of the courtroom during recess following the hearing of the recording of Shirley Ledford's rape, abuse, and torture. Weeping openly, Kay stated to the reporters gathered outside the courtroom: "Everybody who has heard that tape has had it affect their lives. I just picture those girls&amp;nbsp;... how alone they were when they died."&lt;ref name="The Evening Independent 1981"/&gt; When questioned by reporters as to whether the audiotape should have been introduced into evidence, given the obvious psychological and emotional trauma caused to many in the courtroom through the contents being broadcast, Kay simply stated: "You're darn right it [the audio tape] should have been. The jury needs to know what these guys did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jury Hears Tape Made During Rape, Torture |date=January 31, 1981 |url=https://archive.org/stream/The_Times_News_Idaho_Newspaper_1981_01_31/The_Times_News_Idaho_Newspaper_1981_01_31_djvu.txt |publisher=The Times-News |accessdate=November 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 1981, Bittaker testified on his own behalf.&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|234}} Bittaker denied any knowledge in the abduction and murder of Lucinda Schaefer, and claimed he had paid Andrea Hall to pose for the Polaroid photographs depicting her found at his Burbank motel after Hall had agreed to his offer of $200 for sex. He then claimed Norris had walked Hall into the San Gabriel Mountains, before returning alone and informing Bittaker he had told Hall to "find her own way home."&lt;ref name="findlaw.com"/&gt;

Bittaker had a similar explanation as to the double murder of Jacqueline Lamp and Jackie Gilliam: he claimed Gilliam accepted an offer of money for sex and posing for pictures, and that he had last seen the girls alone with Norris in his GMC van. With regards to the murder of Shirley Ledford, he claimed she had agreed to theatrically scream for the tape recorder, and that she was not tortured in his presence, but had been left alone with Norris.

Bittaker's trial lasted for over three weeks. On February 10, 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/62443464/|title=A Coathanger the State Claims Lawrence Bittaker Used to Kill One Victim|access-date=October 16, 2017|newspaper=The San Bernardino County Sun|date=February 10, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; the prosecution and defense counsels began their [[closing argument]]s. In the closing argument delivered by the prosecution, Stephen Kay apologized to the jury that he was only asking for the death penalty, adding that he wished the law permitted him to request that the same suffering be inflicted upon Bittaker that he had inflicted upon his victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/20110209/dennis-mccarthy-pain-lingers-as-death-row-inmate-lives-on|title=Dennis McCarthy: Pain lingers as death row inmate lives on|publisher=|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kay then described Bittaker as an "excuse for a man" as he held aloft pictures of each of the five murdered girls before the jury. Seeking the death penalty for Bittaker, Kay referred to the case as "one of the most shocking, brutal cases in the history of American crime," before adding: "If the death penalty is not appropriate in this case, then when will it ever be?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death sentence ordered for murderer of 5 girls|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&amp;dat=19810225&amp;id=0vpLAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5477,2221303|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=Spokane Daily Chronicle|agency=UPI|date=February 25, 1981|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defense attorney Albert Garber requested the jury discount the testimony of Roy Norris; arguing in favor of Bittaker's claims that Norris had committed the actual murders, and claiming the testimony of the prosecutors throughout the trial amounted to little more than a "bloodlust," adding that the prosecution had repeatedly recited the "gory details" of the murders. Garber harked to the earlier testimony of a psychologist named Michael Maloney, who had testified as to Bittaker's inability to [[empathy|empathize]] with other people's feelings and emotions&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt; in addition to the fact that, with the exception of Bittaker's 1974 stabbing of Gary Louie, all of Bittaker's previous criminal convictions were for nonviolent offenses. The defense also claimed that insufficient corroborative evidence existed to convict Bittaker.&lt;ref name="Leagle.com"/&gt;

On February 17, 1981,&lt;ref name="Spokane Daily Chronicle"/&gt; after deliberating for three days, the jury found Bittaker guilty of five counts of first-degree murder, one charge of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, five charges of kidnapping, nine charges of rape, two charges of forcible oral copulation,&lt;ref name="Bittaker sentenced to death"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bittaker sentenced to death|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&amp;dat=19810225&amp;id=jeoxAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4579,5400162|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Boca Raton News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|page=3A|date=February 25, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; one charge of sodomy, and three charges of unlawful possession of a firearm.&lt;ref name="The Bulletin"&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspect guilty in 5 murders|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19810218&amp;id=WvpXAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4020,5643401|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[The Bulletin (Bend)|The Bulletin]]|agency=UPI|date=February 18, 1981|location=[[Bend, Oregon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberations as to whether Bittaker should be sentenced to death or life without parole began February 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutor wants Death Penalty: Suspect Guilty in 5 Murders |date=February 18, 1981 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19810218&amp;id=WvpXAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4020,5643401 |publisher=The Bulletin |accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury deliberated for just 90 minutes&lt;ref name="The Bulletin"/&gt; before they returned with their verdict: Bittaker was sentenced to death for the five counts of first-degree murder upon which the prosecution had sought this penalty.&lt;ref name="MorningNews1981"/&gt; He showed no emotion as the verdict was delivered. Superior Court Judge Thomas Fredericks then ordered Bittaker to appear in court on March 24 for formal sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/24/Bittaker-sentenced-to-death/5880354258000/|title=Bittaker Sentenced to Death|date=March 24, 1981|publisher=|via=www.upi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, in accordance with the jury verdict, Lawrence Bittaker was formally sentenced to death. In the event that the sentence imposed was ever reverted to life imprisonment, Judge Thomas Fredericks imposed an alternative sentence of 199 years, 4 months' imprisonment to take immediate effect.&lt;ref name="Crime Classification Manual"/&gt;{{rp|234}}

===Imprisonment and appeals===
Bittaker appealed his conviction and sentencing, citing procedural errors such as the validity of warrants used to authorize the search of his van and motel room, and the dismissal by the judge of a woman initially hired at the stage of jury selection to advise the defense counsel in matters relating to jury views upon the death penalty. Nonetheless, Bittaker's appeal was dismissed on June 22, 1989, with the court ruling that any procedural errors were minor and—in view of the strong evidence against Bittaker—did not affect the overall verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-23/news/mn-2460_1_lawrence-sigmond-bittaker-conviction-and-sentence-fair-trial|title=Death Sentence Upheld for Killer Who Showed 'Astonishing Cruelty'|first=Philip|last=Hager|date=June 23, 1989|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A renewed execution date was scheduled for July 23, 1991. Bittaker again appealed the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that he be executed, and was granted a further stay of execution on July 9, 1991.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|253}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:SanQuentinSP.jpg|right|thumb|Bittaker remains incarcerated on death row at [[San Quentin State Prison]].]]
Lawrence Bittaker has granted several death row interviews following his 1981 conviction. To date, he has never expressed any remorse for his crimes, and states the only remorse he feels is for the fact he and Norris were arrested, thus "ruining" his own life.&lt;ref&gt;''Journey into Darkness'' {{ISBN|978-0-749-32394-3}} p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact Bittaker currently considers his life to have been a "wasted" one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article96592997.html|title=Death Row Inmate Lawrence Bittaker said he's Getting Afraid of Death|access-date=October 15, 2016|newspaper=The Sacramento Bee|date=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he has also marveled that he and Norris had little in common before their acquaintance at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo in 1977, before adding that they have "one hell of a lot in common now!"&lt;ref name="True Detective"/&gt;{{rp|44}} In reference to one of the torture- and murder implements he and Norris used upon their victims, Bittaker responds to letters he receives with the nickname "Pliers" Bittaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawrence Bittaker, a Most Depraved Killer, Twists Justice System |date=August 20, 2016 |url=https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/dan-morain/article96800957.html |publisher=The Sacramento Bee |accessdate=September 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his incarceration, Bittaker has filed more than 40 [[Frivolous litigation|frivolous lawsuits]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawsuits Let Murderer Delay Day of Justice |date=March 4, 1997 |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/%60HE%27S+JUST+SO+CLEVER,+THOUGH,+AND+KNOWS+HOW+TO+PLAY+THE+SYSTEM.%27+%3A...-a083858046 |publisher=The Free Library |accessdate=September 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; over issues as trivial as his being served a broken cookie and crushed sandwiches by the prison cafeteria, which he cited as an example of his being subjected to [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Let's curb jailhouse lawyers|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19960429&amp;id=Bh5OAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3046,7756635|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Deseret News]]|agency=Scripps Howard News Service|date=April 29, 1996|page=A8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bittaker was declared a [[Vexatious litigation|vexatious litigant]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-20/news/ls-5250_1_vexatious-litigant-list|title=Courting Trouble: A Unique Law Turns the Tables on Those Who File Numerous or Frivolous Lawsuits|first=Pamela|last=Warrick|date=November 20, 1995|accessdate=December 27, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this declaration, he may no longer file lawsuits without the express permission of an attorney or a judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-20/news/ls-5250_1_vexatious-litigant-list|title=Courting Trouble: A Unique Law Turns the Tables on Those Who File Numerous or Frivolous Lawsuits|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 20, 1995|access-date=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy Norris remains incarcerated at Donovan State Prison. Since his conviction, he has repeatedly claimed the sole reason he participated in the murders was out of fear of Bittaker.&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|135}} Norris also claims to have twice contemplated confessing to his and Bittaker's responsibility in the murders to the police; he also claims to have successfully deterred three potential victims from entering Bittaker's van.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|78}}

Norris claims that although he enjoyed the actual intercourse with the victims, only Bittaker enjoyed the act of torture and murder, stating: "I didn't enjoy killing—that was Lawrence [Bittaker]. It was his favorite part:&lt;ref name="Team Killers"/&gt;{{rp|135}} watching the women struggle to live; knowing he'd soon be taking life away." (Both investigators and psychologists have stated Norris derived extreme gratification from the domination, abuse, and torture inflicted upon his victims; these respective parties have also harked towards Norris's extensive history of physical and sexual violence against women prior to his meeting Bittaker, and his repeated instances of denial of culpability for his actions.&lt;ref name="Furio"/&gt;{{rp|66}})

Roy Norris initially became eligible for parole in 2009.&lt;ref name="Daily Breeze Mar 24, 2009"/&gt; Norris declined to attend the parole hearing, thereby automatically deferring his parole eligibility for another 10 years. He is next eligible for parole in 2019.&lt;ref name="Daily Breeze Mar 24, 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Altman|first1=Larry|title=Redondo Beach killer is denied parole|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/2009/03/25/redondo-beach-killer-is-denied-parole/|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Daily Breeze]]|date=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Townsend|first1=Catherine|title=A Look Back At The "Tool Box Killers" Who Tortured, Killed Five Teens in 1979 - CrimeFeed|url=http://crimefeed.com/2016/10/look-back-tool-box-killers-tortured-killed-five-teens-1979/|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=CrimeFeed|publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC.|date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No parole for killer of 5|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/2009/03/25/no-parole-for-killer-of-5/|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=Daily Breeze|date=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Kay, the prosecutor at Bittaker's trial, still considers the murders committed by Bittaker and Norris as being the worst criminal case he has ever prosecuted or encountered and remains insistent in his belief that Bittaker deserves to be executed more than any other inmate incarcerated on California's death row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCarthy|first1=Dennis|title='He's just so clever, though, and knows how to play the system.' : Lawsuits let murderer delay day of justice.|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/%20:...-a083858046|accessdate=October 16, 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=March 4, 1997|via=[[TheFreeLibrary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, he has stated that for over two years following the trial of Lawrence Bittaker, his sleep was disturbed by recurring nightmares in which he would be rushing to Bittaker's van to prevent harm coming to the girls, but would "always get there too late."&lt;ref name="Daily Breeze Mar 24, 2009"/&gt;

Detective Paul Bynum, the chief investigator of the murders committed by Bittaker and Norris, committed suicide in December 1987. He was 39 years old. In a ten-page suicide note,&lt;ref name="Markman"/&gt;{{rp|276}} Bynum specifically referred to the murders committed by Bittaker and Norris as haunting him, and of his fear they may be released from prison.&lt;ref name="Daily Breeze Mar 24, 2009"/&gt;

{{distinguish|Legitimacy (family law)}}
[[File:John Locke by Herman Verelst.png|thumb|185px|right|[[John Locke]]: consent of the governed confers political legitimacy.]]
In [[political science]], '''legitimacy''' is the right and acceptance of an [[authority]], usually a governing law or a [[regime|régime]]. Whereas "authority" denotes a specific position in an established government, the term "legitimacy" denotes a ''system'' of government—wherein 
"government" denotes "[[sphere of influence]]". An authority viewed as legitimate often has the right and justification to exercise [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Political legitimacy is considered a basic condition for governing, without which a government will suffer legislative deadlock(s) and collapse. In political systems where this is not the case, unpopular régimes survive because they are considered legitimate by a small, influential [[elite|élite]].&lt;ref name="Dahl, Robert A. pp. 124"&gt;Dahl, Robert A. ''Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition'' (pp. 124–188). New Haven (Connecticut) and London: Yale University Press, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinese political philosophy, since the historical period of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1046–256 BC), the political legitimacy of a ruler and government was derived from the [[Mandate of Heaven]], and unjust rulers who lost said mandate therefore lost the right to rule the people.

In [[Ethics|moral philosophy]], the term "legitimacy" is often positively interpreted as the [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] status conferred by a governed people upon their governors' institutions, offices, and actions, based upon the belief that their government's actions are appropriate uses of power by a legally constituted government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phelps|first1=Martha Lizabeth|title=Doppelgangers of the State: Private Security and Transferable Legitimacy|journal=Politics &amp; Policy|date=December 2014|volume=42|issue=6|pages=824–849|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/polp.12100/abstract|doi=10.1111/polp.12100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era British social philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) said that political legitimacy derives from popular explicit and implicit [[consent of the governed]]: "The argument of the [''Second''] ''Treatise'' is that the government is not legitimate unless it is carried on with the consent of the governed."&lt;ref&gt;Ashcraft, Richard (ed.): ''John Locke: Critical Assessments'' (p. 524). London: Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] [[Dolf Sternberger]] said that "[l]egitimacy is the foundation of such governmental power as is exercised, both with a consciousness on the government's part that it has a right to govern, and with some recognition by the governed of that right".&lt;ref&gt;Sternberger, Dolf: "Legitimacy" in ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (ed. D.L. Sills) Vol. 9 (p. 244). New York: Macmillan, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[political sociologist]] [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] said that legitimacy also "involves the capacity of a political system to engender and maintain the belief that existing political institutions are the most appropriate and proper ones for the society".&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, Seymour Martin: ''Political Man: The Social Bases of Politics'' (2nd ed.) (p. 64). London: Heinemann, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The American political scientist [[Robert A. Dahl]] explained legitimacy as a reservoir: so long as the water is at a given level, political stability is maintained, if it falls below the required level, political legitimacy is endangered.&lt;ref name="Dahl, Robert A. pp. 124"/&gt;

== Types ==

Legitimacy is "a value whereby something or someone is recognized and accepted as right and proper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Jing|title=Useful Complaints: How Petitions Assist Decentralized Authoritarianism in China|year=2016|publisher=Lexington Books|location=New York|isbn=9781498534536|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In political science, legitimacy usually is understood as the popular acceptance and recognition by the public of the authority of a governing régime, whereby authority has political power through consent and mutual understandings, not coercion. The three types of political legitimacy described by German [[sociologist]] [[Max Weber]] are traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal:

*Traditional legitimacy derives from societal custom and habit that emphasize the history of the authority of [[tradition]]. Traditionalists understand this form of rule as historically accepted, hence its continuity, because it is the way society has always been. Therefore, the institutions of traditional government usually are historically continuous, as in [[monarchy]] and [[Tribe|tribalism]].
*Charismatic legitimacy derives from the ideas and personal [[charisma]] of the leader, a person whose authoritative [[persona]] charms and psychologically dominates the people of the society to agreement with the government's régime and rule. A charismatic government usually features weak political and administrative institutions, because they derive authority from the persona of the leader, and usually disappear without the leader in power. However, if the charismatic leader has a successor, a government derived from charismatic legitimacy might continue.
*Rational-legal legitimacy derives from a system of institutional procedure, wherein government institutions establish and enforce law and order in the public interest. Therefore, it is through public trust that the government will abide the law that confers rational-legal legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neil|first=Patrick H.|title=Essentials of Comparative Politics|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-93376-5|pages=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Numinous legitimacy ===

{{further|Divine right of kings|Mandate of Heaven|Imperial cult (ancient Rome)}}

In a [[theocracy]], government legitimacy derives from the spiritual authority of a god or a goddess.

* In [[ancient Egypt]] (c. 3150 BC), the legitimacy of the dominion of a [[Pharaoh]] (god–king) was theologically established by doctrine that posited the pharaoh as the Egyptian patron god [[Horus]], son of [[Osiris]].
[[File:Coat of arms Holy See.svg|thumb|150px|right|Theocracy: The coat of arms of the [[Holy See]], the seat of [[Pope|Papal government]].]]
* In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[priest]]hood derives its legitimacy from a divine source; the Roman Magisterium dogmatically teaches that Jesus Christ designated St. Peter the [[universal jurisdiction|supreme]] and [[papal infallibility|infallible]] head of the entire Christian Church, and thus each [[Papacy|bishop of Rome]] is sanctified, legitimate, and possesses these [[charism]]s as well.

=== Civil legitimacy ===
[[File:Women vote in Cairo - 27-May-2014.jpg|left|thumb|One measurement of civil legitimacy is who has access to the vote, including women are able to vote.]]
The political legitimacy of a civil government derives from agreement among the autonomous constituent institutions—legislative, judicial, executive—combined for the national common good. One way civil society grants legitimacy to governments is through public elections. There are also those who refute the legitimacy offered by public elections, pointing out that the amount of legitimacy public elections can grant depends significantly on the electoral system conducting the elections. In the United States this issue has surfaced around how voting is impacted by gerrymandering&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2017/07/06/a-primer-on-gerrymandering-and-political-polarization/|title=A primer on gerrymandering and political polarization|last=Dews|first=Fred|date=2017-07-06|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Shelby County v. Holder|repeal of part of the Voting Rights Act]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html|title=Supreme Court Invalidates Key Part of Voting Rights Act|last=Liptak|first=Adam|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another challenge to the political legitimacy offered by elections is whether or not marginalized groups such as women or those who are incarcerated are allowed to vote.{{fact|date=July 2018}} 

Civil legitimacy can be granted through different measures for accountability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/programs/cri/programs/governance-accountability|title=Governance &amp; Accountability|website=www.hks.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; than voting, such as financial transparency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://financialtransparency.org|title=Home - Financial Transparency Coalition|website=Financial Transparency Coalition|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stake-holder accountability. In the international system another method for measuring civil legitimacy is through accountability to international human rights norms.{{fact|date=July 2018}} 

In an effort determine what makes a government legitimate the Center for Public Impact launched a project to hold a global conversation about legitimacy stating, inviting citizens, academics and governments to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://findinglegitimacy.centreforpublicimpact.org|title=Finding Legitimacy|website=findinglegitimacy.centreforpublicimpact.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also publishes case studies that consider the theme of legitimacy as it applies to projects in a number of different countries including Bristol, Lebanon and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/insights/?searchString=&amp;theme%5B%5D=legitimacy&amp;orderby=|title=Viewpoints - Centre for Public Impact (CPI)|work=Centre for Public Impact (CPI)|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Good" governance vs. "bad" governance ===
The United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commission (OHCHR) established standards of what is considered "good governance" that include the key attributes transparency, responsibility, accountability, participation and responsiveness (to the needs of the people).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/Development/GoodGovernance/Pages/GoodGovernanceIndex.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} 
	Good Governance and Human Rights|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Input, output and throughput legitimacy ===

Assessing the political legitimacy of a government can be done by looking at three different aspects of which a government can derive legitimacy. [[Fritz W. Scharpf|Fritz Scharpf]] introduced two normative criteria, which are output legitimacy, i.e. the effectiveness of policy outcomes for people and input legitimacy, the responsiveness to citizen concerns as a result of participation by the people. A third normative criterion was added by [[Vivien A. Schmidt|Vivien Schmidt]], who analyzes legitimacy also in terms of what she calls throughput, i.e. the governance processes that happen in between input and output.

=== Negative and positive legitimacy ===

Abulof distinguishes between negative political legitimacy (NPL), which is about the object of legitimation (answering ''what'' is legitimate), and positive political legitimacy (PPL), which is about the source of legitimation (answering ''who'' is the 'legitimator').{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} NPL is concerned with establishing where to draw the line between good and bad, PPL with who should be drawing it in the first place. From the NPL perspective, political legitimacy emanates from appropriate actions; from a PPL perspective, it emanates from appropriate actors. In the social contract tradition, Hobbes and Locke focused on NPL (stressing security and liberty, respectively), while Rousseau focused more on PPL ("the people" as the legitimator). Arguably, political stability depends on both forms of legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Abulof"&gt;Abulof, Uriel (2015).

=== Instrumental and substantive legitimacy ===

Weber's understanding of legitimacy rests on shared ''values'', such as tradition and rational-legality. But policies that aim at (re-)constructing legitimacy by improving the service delivery or 'output' of a state often only respond to shared ''needs''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weigand|first=Florian|date=April 2015|title=Investigating the Role of Legitimacy in the Political Order of Conflict-torn Spaces|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/62691/1/Investigating-Legitimacy-in-the-Political-Order-of-Conflict-torn-spaces.pdf|journal=SiT/WP|volume=04/15|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, substantive sources of legitimacy need to be distinguished from more instrumental ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Instrumental legitimacy'' rests on "the rational assessment of the usefulness of an authority ..., describing to what extent an authority responds to shared needs. Instrumental legitimacy is very much based on the perceived effectiveness of service delivery. Conversely, ''substantive legitimacy'' is a more abstract normative judgment, which is underpinned by shared values. If a person believes that an entity has the right to exercise social control, he or she may also accept personal disadvantages."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Max Weber 1894.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Max Weber]]: societies are politically cyclical.]] 
Max Weber proposed that societies behave cyclically in governing themselves with different types of governmental legitimacy. That [[democracy]] was unnecessary for establishing legitimacy, a condition that can be established with codified laws, customs, and cultural principles, not by means of [[voting|popular suffrage]]. That a society might decide to revert from the legitimate government of a rational–legal authority to the charismatic government of a leader; e.g., the [[Nazi Germany]] of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Fascism|Fascist]] Italy under [[Benito Mussolini]], and [[Francoist Spain]] under General [[Francisco Franco]].

[[File:matteidoganportrait.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Mattei Dogan]]]]
The French political scientist [[Mattei Dogan]]'s contemporary interpretation of Weber's types of political legitimacy (traditional, charismatic, legal-rational) proposes that they are conceptually insufficient to comprehend the complex relationships that constitute a legitimate political system in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;Dogan, Mattei: Conceptions of Legitimacy, ''Encyclopedia of Government and Politics'' 2nd edition, Mary Hawkesworth and Maurice Kogan editors, Vol. 2, pp. 116-219. London: Routledge 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Dogan proposed that traditional authority and charismatic authority are obsolete as forms of contemporary government (e.g., the Islamic Republic of Iran (est. 1979) rule by means of the priestly Koranic interpretations by the [[Ayatollah]] [[Khomeini]]). That traditional authority has disappeared in the [[Middle East]]; that the rule-proving exceptions are [[Islamic Republic of Iran|Islamic Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].{{clarify|date=December 2014}}{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Furthermore, the third Weber type of political legitimacy, rational-legal authority, exists in so many permutations no longer allow it to be limited as a type of legitimate authority.{{clarify|date=December 2014}}

== Forms of legitimate government ==

In determining the political legitimacy of a system of rule and government, the term proper—''political legitimacy''—is philosophically an [[essentially contested concept]] that facilitates understanding the different applications and interpretations of abstract, [[Qualitative properties|qualitative]], and [[Evaluation|evaluative]] concepts such as "[[art]]", "[[social justice]]", et cetera, as applied in [[aesthetics]], [[political philosophy]], the [[philosophy of history]], and the [[philosophy of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Initially published as Gallie (1956a), then as Gallie (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in defining the political legitimacy of a system of government and rule, the term "essentially contested concept" indicates that a key term ([[communism]], [[democracy]], [[constitutionalism]], etc.) has different meanings within a given political argument. Hence, the intellectually restrictive politics of [[Dogma#Dogma outside of religion|dogmatism]] ("My answer is right, and all others are wrong"), [[scepticism]] ("All answers are equally true or [false]; everyone has a right to his own truth"), and [[eclecticism]] ("Each meaning gives a partial view, so the more meanings the better") are inappropriate philosophic stances for managing a political term that has more than one meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Garver (1978), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; (see: [[W. B. Gallie|Walter Bryce Gallie]])

Establishing what qualifies as a legitimate form of government continues to be a topic of great philosophical controversy. Forms of legitimate government are posited to include:{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*'''[[Communism]]''': The legitimacy of a [[Communist state]] derives from having won a [[civil war]], a [[revolution]], or from having won an election, such as the [[Presidency of Salvador Allende]] (1970–73) in Chile; thus, the actions of the Communist government are legitimate, authorised by the people. In the early twentieth century, [[Communism|Communist parties]] based the arguments supporting the legitimacy of their rule and government upon the scientific nature of [[Marxism]]. (See [[dialectical materialism]].)
*'''[[Constitutionalism]]''': The modern political concept of constitutionalism establishes the law as supreme over the private will, by integrating [[nationalism]], democracy, and limited government. The political legitimacy of constitutionalism derives from popular belief and acceptance that the actions of the government are legitimate because they abide by the law codified in the [[political constitution]]. The political scientist [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] (1901–84) said that, in dividing political power among the organs of government, constitutional law effectively restrains the actions of the government.&lt;ref name="Charlton, Roger p. 23"&gt;Charlton, Roger: ''Political Realities: Comparative Government'' (p. 23). London: Longman, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[checks and balances]].)
*'''[[Democracy]]''': In a democracy, government legitimacy derives from the popular perception that the elected government abides by democratic principles in governing, and thus is legally accountable to its people.&lt;ref name="Charlton, Roger p. 23"/&gt;
*'''[[Fascism]]''': In the 1920s and the 1930s, fascism based its political legitimacy upon the arguments of traditional authority; respectively, the German [[Nazism|National Socialists]] and the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascists]] claimed that the political legitimacy of their right to rule derived from philosophically denying the (popular) political legitimacy of elected [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[democracy|democratic]] governments. During the [[Weimar Republic]] (1918–33), the political philosopher [[Carl Schmitt]] (1888–1985)—whose legal work as the "Crown Jurist of the Third Reich" promoted fascism and [[Deconstruction|deconstructed]] liberal democracy—addressed the matter in ''Legalität und Legitimität'' (Legality and Legitimacy, 1932), an anti-democratic [[Polemics|polemic]] treatise that asked: How can parliamentary government make for law and legality, when a 49 per cent minority accepts as politically legitimate the political will of a 51 per cent majority?&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, Carl: ''Legality and Legitimacy'' (Jeffrey Seitzer translator). Durham (North Carolina): Duke University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Monarchy]]''': In a monarchy, the [[divine right of kings]] establishes the political legitimacy of the rule of the monarch (king or queen); legitimacy also derives from the popular perception (tradition and [[Convention (norm)|custom]]) and acceptance of the monarch as the rightful ruler of nation and country. Contemporarily, such divine-right legitimacy is manifest in the [[absolute monarchy]] of the [[House of Saud]] (est. 1744), a [[royal family]] who have ruled and governed [[Saudi Arabia]] since the 18th century. Moreover, [[constitutional monarchy]] is a variant form of monarchic political legitimacy which combines traditional authority and legal–rational authority, by which means the monarch maintains nationalist unity (one people) and democratic administration (a political constitution).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9891">{{Competition law}}
In [[economics]] and particularly in [[industrial organization]], '''market power''' is the ability of a [[theory of the firm|firm]] to profitably raise the [[market price]] of a good or service over [[marginal cost]]. In [[Perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] markets, market participants have no market power. A firm with total market power can raise prices without losing any customers to competitors. Market participants that have market power are therefore sometimes referred to as "price makers" or "price setters", while those without are sometimes called "price takers". Significant market power occurs when prices exceed marginal cost and [[long run average cost]], so the firm makes profit.

A firm with market power has the ability to individually affect either the total quantity or the prevailing price in the market. Price makers face a downward-sloping [[demand curve]], such that price increases lead to a lower quantity demanded. The decrease in supply as a result of the exercise of market power creates an economic [[deadweight loss]] which is often viewed as socially undesirable. As a result, many countries have [[anti-trust]] or other legislation intended to limit the ability of firms to accrue market power. Such legislation often regulates [[merger]]s and sometimes introduces a judicial power to compel [[divestiture]].

A firm usually has market power by virtue of controlling a large portion of the market. In extreme cases—[[monopoly]] and [[monopsony]]—the firm controls the entire market. However, market size alone is not the only indicator of market power. Highly [[Market concentration|concentrated markets]] may be [[contestable market|contestable]] if there are no [[barriers to entry]] or exit, limiting the incumbent firm's ability to raise its price above competitive levels.

Market power gives firms the ability to engage in unilateral [[anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vatiero Massimiliano|year=2010|title=The Ordoliberal notion of market power: an institutionalist reassessment|doi=10.5235/ecj.v6n3.689|journal=European Competition Journal|volume=6|issue=3|pages=689–707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the behaviours that firms with market power are accused of engaging in include [[predatory pricing]], product [[Tying (commerce)|tying]], and creation of [[Capacity utilization|overcapacity]] or other barriers to entry. If no individual participant in the market has significant market power, then anti-competitive behavior can take place only through [[collusion]], or the exercise of a group of participants' collective market power.

The [[Lerner index]] and [[Herfindahl index]] may be used to measure market power.

==Oligopoly==
When several firms control a significant share of market sales, the resulting market structure is called an [[oligopoly]] or [[oligopsony]].  An oligopoly may engage in [[collusion]], either tacit or overt, and thereby exercise market power. A group of firms that explicitly agree to affect market price or output is called a [[cartel]].

==Monopoly power==
[[Monopoly power]] is an example of [[market failure]] which occurs when one or more of the participants has the ability to influence the [[price]] or other outcomes in some general or specialized [[Market (economics)|market]].  The most commonly discussed form of market power is that of a [[monopoly]], but other forms such as [[monopsony]], and more moderate versions of these two extremes, exist.

A well-known example of monopolistic market power is [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] market share in [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] [[operating system]]s. The ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'' case dealt with an allegation that Microsoft illegally exercised its market power by bundling its [[web browser]] with its operating system.  &lt;!-- A well-known example of monopoly market power is [[Standard Oil]], an oil refining company that held about 90% of the refining capacity in the U.S before it was split up by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1911, but I don't know enough about how Rockefeller abused its market power to use the example. --&gt;
In this respect, the notion of dominance and dominant position in EU Antitrust Law is a strictly related aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Vatiero M. (2009), "An Institutionalist Explanation of Market Dominances". World Competition. Law and Economics Review, 32(2):221–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source==
A monopoly can raise prices and retain customers because the monopoly has no competitors. If a customer has no other place to go to obtain the goods or services, they either pay the increased price or do without.&lt;ref&gt;If the power company raised rates the customer either pays the increase or does without power.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the key to market power is to preclude competition through high barriers of entry. Barriers to entry that are significant sources of market power are control of scarce resources, increasing returns to scale, technological superiority and government created barriers to entry.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Krugman &amp; Wells, Microeconomics 2d ed. (Worth 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[OPEC]] is an example of an organization that has market power due to control over scarce resources&amp;nbsp;— oil. Increasing returns to scale are another important source of market power. Firms experiencing increasing returns to scale are also experiencing decreasing average total costs.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Firms in such industries become more profitable with size.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Therefore over time the industry is dominated by a few large firms. This dominance makes it difficult for start up firms to succeed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Firms like power companies, cable television companies and wireless communication companies with large start up costs fall within this category. A company wishing to enter such industries must have the financial ability to spend millions of dollars before starting operations and generating any revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Often such natural monopolies will also have the benefit of government granted monopolies.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly established firms also have a competitive advantage over new firms. An established firm threatened by a new competitor can lower prices to drive out the competition. Microsoft is a firm that has substantial pricing or market power due to technological superiority in its design and production processes.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Finally government created barriers to entry can be a source of market power. A prime example are patents granted to pharmaceutical companies. These patents give the drug companies a virtual monopoly in the protected product for the term of the patent.

==Measurement==
Concentration ratios are the most common measures of market power.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson &amp; Nordhaus, Microeconomics, 17th ed. (McGraw-Hill 2001) at 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt; The four-firm concentration ratio measures the percentage of total industry output attributable to the top four companies. For monopolies the four firm ratio is 100 per cent while the ratio is zero for perfect competition.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson &amp; Nordhaus, Microeconomics, 17th ed. (McGraw-Hill 2001) at 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The four firm concentration domestic (U.S) ratios for cigarettes is 93%; for automobiles, 84% and for beer, 85%.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Samuelson &amp; Nordhaus, Microeconomics, 17th ed. (McGraw-Hill 2001) at 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another measure of concentration is the [[Herfindahl index|Herfindahl-Hirschman Index]] (HHI) which is calculated by "summing the squares of the percentage market shares of all participants in the market".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The HHI index for perfect competition is zero; for monopoly, 10,000.

U.S. courts almost never consider a firm to possess market power if it has a market share of less than 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gregory Sidak &amp; Hal J. Singer, ''Überregulation Without Economics: The World Trade Organization’s Decision in the U.S.-Mexico Arbitration on Telecommunications Services, General Agreement on Trade in Services, GATS'', 57 FED. COMM. L.J. 1, 34 (2004), http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1388&amp;context=fclj.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elasticity of demand==
Market power is the ability to raise price above [[marginal cost]] (MC) and earn a positive profit.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Perloff, J: Microeconomics Theory &amp; Applications with Calculus page 369. Pearson 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which a firm can raise price (P) above marginal cost depends on the shape of the demand curve at the profit maximizing output.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; That is, elasticity is the critical factor in determining market power. The relationship between market power and the [[price elasticity of demand]] (PED) can be summarized by the equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{P}{MC}=\frac{PED}{1+PED}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that PED will be negative, so the ratio is always greater than one. The higher the P/MC ratio, the more market power the firm possesses. As PED increases in magnitude, the P/MC ratio approaches one, and market power approaches zero.&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, J: Microeconomics Theory &amp; Applications with Calculus Pearson 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
The equation is derived from the monopolist pricing rule:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{P-MC}{P}=-\frac 1 {PED}.&lt;/math&gt;

A '''Mars cycler''' (or '''Earth–Mars cycler''') is a special kind of spacecraft [[trajectory]] that encounters [[Earth]] and [[Mars]] on a regular basis. The term '''Mars cycler''' may also refer to a spacecraft on a Mars cycler trajectory. The '''Aldrin cycler''' is an example of a Mars cycler.

Cyclers are potentially useful for transporting people or materials between those bodies using minimal propellant (relying on [[Gravity assist|gravity-assist]] flybys for most trajectory changes), and can carry heavy radiation shielding to protect people in transit from [[cosmic rays]] and [[Geomagnetic storm|solar storms]].

==Earth–Mars cyclers==
A cycler is a [[Interplanetary spaceflight#Cyclers|trajectory]] that encounters two or more bodies on a regular basis. Once the orbit is established, no propulsion is required to shuttle between the two bodies on a regular basis, although some minor corrections may be necessary due to small perturbations in the orbit. The use of cyclers was considered in 1969 by Walter M. Hollister, who examined the case of an Earth-Venus cycler.{{sfn|Hollister|1969|p=366}}  

Cycler trajectories between Earth and Mars occur in whole-number multiples of the [[synodic period]] between the two planets, which is about 2.135 Earth years. A Martian year is 1.8808 Earth years, so Mars makes eight orbits of the Sun in about the same time as Earth makes 15.{{sfn|Byrnes|Longuski|Aldrin|1993|p=334}} In 1985, [[Buzz Aldrin]] presented an extension of his earlier Lunar cycler work which identified a Mars cycler corresponding to a single synodic period.{{sfn|Aldrin|1985|pp=3-10}} The Aldrin cycler (as it is now known) makes a single eccentric loop around the Sun. It travels from Earth to Mars orbit in 146 days, spends the next 16 months beyond the orbit of Mars, and another 146 days from the Martian orbit back to Earth.{{sfn|McConaghy|Longuski|Byrnes|2002|p=6}}

The existence of the now-eponymous Aldrin Cycler was calculated and confirmed by scientists at [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] later that year, along with the VISIT-1 and VISIT-2 cyclers proposed by John Niehoff in 1985.{{sfn|Friedlander|Niehoff|Byrnes|Longuski|1986|p=31}} {{sfn|McConaghy|Longuski|Byrnes|2002|p=1}} For each Earth–Mars cycler that isn't a multiple of 7 synodic periods, an outbound cycler intersects Mars on the way out from Earth while an inbound cycler intersects Mars on the way in to Earth. The only difference in these trajectories is the date in the synodic period in which the vehicle is launched from Earth. Earth–Mars cyclers with a multiple of 7 synodic periods return to Earth at nearly the same point in its orbit and may encounter Earth and/or Mars multiple times during each cycle. VISIT 1 encounters Earth 3 times and Mars 4 times in 15 years. VISIT 2 encounters Earth 5 times and Mars 2 times in 15 years.{{sfn|McConaghy|Longuski|Byrnes|2002|p=6}} Some possible Earth–Mars cyclers include the following:{{sfn|McConaghy|Longuski|Byrnes|2002|p=6}}

A detailed survey of Earth–Mars cycler trajectories was conducted by Russell and Ocampo. They identified 24 Earth-Mars cyclers with periods of two to four synodic periods, and 92 cyclers with periods of five or six synodic periods. They also found hundreds of non-ballistic cyclers, ones which would require some powered maneuvers.{{sfn|Russell|Ocampo|2004|p=321}}

==Physics==
[[File:Aldrin Cycler.gif|thumb|right|A Mars cycler is an elliptical orbit (green) that crosses the orbits of Earth (blue) and Mars (red), and encounters both planets at the points where it crosses their orbits, although not necessarily on every orbit. (Not to scale)]]
[[File:Gravity assist velocity diagram.png|thumb|Gravity assist velocity diagram.]]

The shape of the cycler can be obtained from the [[conic equation]]:

Earth orbits the Sun in one Earth year, Mars in 1.0888. Neither orbit is perfectly circular; Earth has an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 0.0168, and Mars of 0.0934. The two orbits are not quite coplanar either, as the orbit of Mars in inclined by 1.85 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] to that of Earth. The effect of the gravity of Mars on the cycler orbits is almost negligible, but that of the far more massive Earth needs to be considered. If we ignore these factors, and approximate Mars's orbital period as 1.875 Earth years, then 15 Earth years is 8 Martian years. In the diagram opposite, a spacecraft in an Aldrin cycler orbit that starts from Earth at point E1 will encounter Mars at M1. When it gets back to E1 just over two Earth years later, Earth will no longer be there, but it will encounter Earth again at E2, which is 51.4 degrees, {{frac|1|7}} of an Earth orbit, further round.{{sfn|Byrnes|Longuski|Aldrin|1993|pp=334-335}}
:&lt;math&gt;r = a(1 - \epsilon^2)/(1 + \epsilon \cos \theta)&lt;/math&gt;
Where r is 1 [[astronomical unit]], a is the [[semi-major and semi-minor axes|semi-major axis]], ''&amp;epsilon;'' is the orbital eccentricity and ''&amp;theta;'' is -25.7 (half of -50.4). We can obtain a by solving [[Lambert's problem]] with 50.4 as the initial and final transfer angle. This gives us:
:&lt;math&gt;a = 1.60&lt;/math&gt;
Solving the [[quadratic equation]] gives us:
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = 0.393&lt;/math&gt;
with an orbital period of 2.02 years.{{sfn|Byrnes|Longuski|Aldrin|1993|pp=334-335}}

The angle at which the spacecraft flies past Earth, ''&amp;gamma;'', is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\tan \gamma = (\epsilon r/(a(1 - \epsilon^2))) \sin \theta &lt;/math&gt;
Substituting the values given and derived above gives us a value for ''&amp;gamma;'' of 7.18 degrees. We can calculate the [[gravity assist]] from Earth:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V = 2 V \sin \gamma&lt;/math&gt;
where V is the heliocentric flyby velocity. This can be calculated from:
:&lt;math&gt;V = V_E (2 - r/a)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{SubSup|V|E}} is the velocity of Earth, which is 29.8 km/s. Substituting gives us V = 34.9 km/s, and {{DELTA}}V = 8.73 km/s.{{sfn|Byrnes|Longuski|Aldrin|1993|pp=334-335}}

The excess speed is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;V_\infty = (V^2 + V_E^2 -2 V V_E \cos \gamma)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
Which gives us a value for {{SubSup|V|∞}} of 6.54 km/s. The turn angle {{delta}} can be calculated from:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V = 2 V_\infty \sin \delta&lt;/math&gt;
Which gives us {{delta}} = 41.9 degrees, meaning that we have an 83.8 degree turn. The radius of closest approach to Earth {{SubSup|r|p}}will be given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \delta = 1 / (1 + (r_p V_\infty^2 / \mu_E)&lt;/math&gt;
Where {{SubSup|μ|E}} is the [[gravitational constant]] of the Earth. Substituting the values gives us {{SubSup|r|p}} = {{convert|4640|km}}, which is bad because the radius of the Earth is {{convert|6371|km}}. A correction would therefore be required to comfortably avoid the planet.{{sfn|Byrnes|Longuski|Aldrin|1993|pp=334-335}}

==Theoretical usage==
[[File:Aldrin Cycler 2.gif|thumb|Rather than wait for the cycler to come around again, Aldrin proposed using a second cycler to make the return trip. (Not to scale)]]
Aldrin proposed a pair of Mars cycler vehicles providing regular transport between Earth and Mars.{{sfn|Aldrin|1985|pp=3-10}} While the astronauts traveling to the Moon could do so in a small spacecraft, a mission to Mars would require something much larger. Astronauts would need a much larger facility with life support, living space and radiation shielding for the much longer journey.{{sfn|Friedlander|Niehoff|Byrnes|Longuski|1986|p=31}}&lt;ref name="Roadmap"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1= Aldrin |first1= Buzz |author-link1=Buzz Aldrin |first2= David |last2= Noland |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a333/2076326/ |title= Buzz Aldrin's Roadmap To Mars - A PM Exclusive |magazine= Popular Mechanics |date= 13 December 2005 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1999 NASA study estimated that a mission to Mars would require lifting about {{convert|437|t|ST|sp=us}} into space, of which {{convert|250|t|ST|sp=us}} was propellant. At the going rate of around $20 million per ton, this would cost $8.4 billion.&lt;ref name="Damn Interesting" /&gt;

Aldrin proposed that the costs of Mars missions could be greatly reduced by use of large space stations, called "castles", in cyclic orbits. Once established in their orbits, they would make regular trips between Earth and Mars without requiring any propellant. Items other than consumables would therefore have to be launched only once.{{sfn|Friedlander|Niehoff|Byrnes|Longuski|1986|p=31}}&lt;ref name="Roadmap" /&gt; Two castles would be used, an outbound one on an Aldrin cycler with a fast transfer to Mars and long trip back, and an inbound one with fast trip to Earth and long return to Mars,{{sfn|Byrnes|Longuski|Aldrin|1993|p=334}} which Aldrin called up and down escalators.{{sfn|Friedlander|Niehoff|Byrnes|Longuski|1986|p=31}}

The astronauts would meet up with the cycler in Earth orbit and later Mars orbit in specialised craft called "taxis". One cycler would travel an outbound route from Earth to Mars in about five months. Another Mars cycler in a complementary trajectory would travel from Mars to Earth, also in about five months. Taxi and cargo vehicles would attach to the cycler at one planet and detach upon reaching the other.&lt;ref name="Damn Interesting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=960 |last=Bellows |first=Alan |title=The Martian Express |publisher=Damn Interesting |date=10 April 2008 |access-date=17 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycler concept would therefore provide for routine safe and economic transport between Earth and Mars.{{sfn|Rogers|Hughes|Longuski|Aldrin|2015|p=114}}

A significant drawback of the cycler concept was that the Aldrin cycler flies by both planets at high speed. A taxi would need to accelerate to {{convert|15000|mph}} around Earth, and {{convert|22000|mph}} near Mars. To get around this, Aldrin proposed what he called a "semi-cycler", in which the castle would slow down around Mars, orbiting it, and later resuming the cycler orbit. This would require fuel to execute the braking and re-cycling maneivers.&lt;ref name="Roadmap" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Damn Interesting" /&gt;

The problem of getting the castles into cycler orbits was also considered. It was found that this could be accomplished with considerable savings in fuel by performing a series of low thrust maneuvers.{{sfn|Rogers|Hughes|Longuski|Aldrin|2015|p=114}} Upon launch, the castle would be placed into an interim orbit, and then use the Earth's mass to assist it into the cycler orbit.{{sfn|Rogers|Hughes|Longuski|Aldrin|2015|pp=120-121}} Assuming the use of [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]] fuel, which has a [[specific impulse]] of about 450 s, in the vicinity of Earth, and [[monomethylhydrazine]] and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] fuel, as was  employed by the ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' spacecraft for deep space maneuvers, which has a specific impulse of 300 s, it is possible to estimate the fuel required to establish a cycler obit.{{sfn|Rogers|Hughes|Longuski|Aldrin|2015|p=123}}  

In the case of the Aldrin cycler, use of a gravity assist reduces the fuel requirement by about {{convert|24.3|t|ST|sp=us}}, or 15 percent. Other cyclers showed less impressive improvement, due to the shape of their orbits, and when the they encounter the Earth. In the case of the VISIT-1 cycler, the benefit would be around {{convert|0.2|t|ST|sp=us}}, less than one percent, which would hardly justify the additional three years required to establish the orbit.{{sfn|Rogers|Hughes|Longuski|Aldrin|2015|p=123}}

The '''mirror test''' – sometimes called the '''mark test''', '''mirror self-recognition test''' ('''MSR'''), '''red spot''' technique, or '''rouge test''' – is a [[animal behaviour|behavioural]] technique developed in 1970 by psychologist [[Gordon Gallup Jr.]] as an attempt to determine whether an animal possesses the ability of visual self-recognition.&lt;ref name="Gallup"&gt;{{cite journal

The MSR test is the traditional method for attempting to measure [[self-awareness]]. However, there has been agreement that animals can be self-aware in ways not measured by the mirror test, such as distinguishing between their own and others' songs and scents.&lt;ref name="bekoff"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bekoff |first=Marc |date=2002-09-19 |title=Animal reflections |url=https://www.philanthropysouthwest.org/sites/default/files/resources/animal%2520reflections.pdf |journal=Nature |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, animals can pass the MSR and not necessarily have self-awareness.&lt;ref name="cammaerts" /&gt;

In the classic MSR test, an animal is anaesthetised and then marked (e.g. painted, or a sticker attached) on an area of the body the animal cannot normally see.  When the animal recovers from the [[anesthetic]], it is given access to a [[mirror]].  If the animal then touches or investigates the mark, it is taken as an indication that the animal perceives the reflected image as itself, rather than of another animal.

Very few species have passed the MSR test. As of 2016, only [[great ape]]s (including humans), a single [[Asiatic elephant]], [[dolphins]], [[orcas]], and the [[Eurasian magpie]] have passed the MSR test. A wide range of species have been reported to fail the test, including several species of monkey, [[giant panda]]s, [[sea lion]]s, and [[dog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Animals That Have Passed the Mirror Test|url=http://www.animalcognition.org/2015/04/15/list-of-animals-that-have-passed-the-mirror-test/|accessdate=23 November 2015|date=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Rebecca|title=10 Animals with Self Awareness|url=http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/10-animals-with-self-awareness.html|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method and history==
The inspiration for the mirror test comes from an [[anecdote]] about [[Charles Darwin]] and a captive [[orangutan]]. While visiting the [[London Zoo]] in [[1838]], Darwin observed an orangutan, named Jenny, throwing a tantrum after being teased with an apple by her keeper. This started him thinking about the subjective experience of an orangutan.&lt;ref name="darwin1"&gt;Jonathan Weiner. ''Darwin at the Zoo.'' available at [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=darwin-at-the-zoo http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=darwin-at-the-zoo].&lt;/ref&gt;  He also watched Jenny gaze into a mirror and noted the possibility that she recognised herself in the reflection.&lt;ref name="darwin2"&gt;Carl Zimmer. ''The Descent of Man: The Concise Edition.'' excerpt available at [http://carlzimmer.com/books/descentofman/excerpt.html http://carlzimmer.com/books/descentofman/excerpt.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Gordon Gallup, Jr., experimentally investigated the possibility of self-recognition with two male and two female wild pre-adolescent [[chimpanzee]]s (''Pan troglodytes''), none of which had presumably seen a mirror previously. Each chimpanzee was put into a room by itself for two days. Next, a full-length mirror was placed in the room for a total of 80 hours at periodically decreasing distances. A multitude of behaviours was recorded upon introducing the mirrors to the chimpanzees.  Initially, the chimpanzees made threatening gestures at their own images, ostensibly seeing their own reflections as threatening. Eventually, the chimps used their own reflections for self-directed responding behaviours, such as grooming parts of their body previously not observed without a mirror, picking their noses, making faces, and blowing bubbles at their own reflections.

Gallup expanded the study by manipulating the chimpanzees' appearance and observing their reaction to their reflection in the mirror.  Gallup anaesthetised the chimpanzees and then painted a red alcohol-soluble dye on the eyebrow ridge and on the top half of the opposite ear.  When the dye dried, it had virtually no olfactory or tactile cues.  Gallup then returned the chimpanzees to the cage (with the mirror removed) and allowed them to regain full consciousness.  He then recorded the frequency with which the chimpanzees spontaneously touched the marked areas of skin. After 30 minutes, the mirror was re-introduced into the room and the frequency of touching the marked areas again determined.  The frequency of touching increased to 4–10 with the mirror present, compared to only 1 when the mirror had been removed.  The chimpanzees sometimes inspected their fingers visually or olfactorily after touching the marks.  Other mark-directed behaviour includes turning and adjusting of the body to better view the mark in the mirror, or tactile examination of the mark with an appendage while viewing the mirror.&lt;ref name="Gallup" /&gt;

An important aspect of the classical mark-test is that the mark/dye is non-tactile, preventing attention being drawn to the marking through additional perceptual cues ([[somesthesis]]).  For this reason, animals in the majority of classical tests are anesthetised. Some tests use a tactile marker.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mitchell, R.W.|year=1995|title=Evidence of dolphin self-recognition and the difficulties of interpretation|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=4|issue=2|pages=229–234|doi=10.1006/ccog.1995.1029|pmid=8521261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals that are considered to be able to recognise themselves in a mirror typically progress through four stages of behaviour when facing a mirror:&lt;ref name="Plotnik2006" /&gt;
{{ordered list|list_style_type=lower-alpha
| social responses
| physical inspection (e.g. looking behind the mirror)
| repetitive mirror-testing behaviour
| realisation of seeing themselves}}

Gallup conducted a follow-up study in which two chimpanzees with no prior experience of a mirror were put under anesthesia, marked and observed.  After recovery, they made no mark-directed behaviours either before or after being provided with a mirror.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The rouge test was also done by Michael Lewis and Jeanne Brooks-Gunn in 1979 for the purpose of self-recognition with human mothers and their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social and Personality Development|last=Shaffer|first=David|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|year=2009|isbn=978-0-495-60038-1|location=Belmont|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals that have passed==
[[File:Pica pica -Manchester -England -side-8.jpg|thumb|[[European magpie]]s have demonstrated mirror self recognition]]

A large number of studies using a wide range of species have investigated the occurrence of spontaneous, mark-directed behaviour when given a mirror, as originally proposed by Gallup.  Most marked animals given a mirror initially respond with social behaviour, such as aggressive displays, and continue to do so during repeated testing. Only a small number of species have touched or directed behaviour toward the mark, thereby passing the classic MSR test.

Findings in MSR studies are not always conclusive. Even in chimpanzees, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, clear-cut evidence of self-recognition is not obtained in all individuals tested.&lt;ref name="Prior" /&gt; Prevalence is about 75% in young adults and considerably less in young and aging individuals.&lt;ref name="Povinelli"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Povinelli, D.J., Rulf, A.B., Landau, K.R. and Bierschwale, D.T.|year=1993|title=Self-recognition in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): distribution, ontogeny, and patterns of emergence|journal=J.

Until the 2008 study on magpies, self-recognition was thought to reside in the [[neocortex]] area of the brain. However, this brain region is absent in non-mammals. Self-recognition may be a case of [[convergent evolution]], where similar evolutionary pressures result in similar behaviours or traits, although species arrive at them via different routes, and the underlying mechanism may be different.&lt;ref name="Suddendorf" /&gt;

All three Asian elephants in the study were standing in front of a 2.5&amp;nbsp;m-by-2.5&amp;nbsp;m mirror—they inspected the rear and brought food close to the mirror for consumption. Evidence of elephant self-awareness was shown when one (and only one) elephant, Happy, repeatedly touched a painted ''X'' on her head with her trunk, a mark which could only be seen in the mirror. Happy ignored another mark made with colorless paint that was also on her forehead to ensure she was not merely reacting to a smell or feeling. [[Frans De Waal]], who ran the study, stated, "These parallels between humans and elephants suggest a convergent cognitive evolution possibly related to complex society and cooperation."&lt;ref name="Plotnik2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Plotnik, J.M., de Waal, F.B.M. and Reiss, D.|year=2006|title=Self-recognition in an Asian elephant|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=103|issue=45|pages=17053–17057|doi=10.1073/pnas.0608062103|pmid=17075063|bibcode=2006PNAS..10317053P|pmc=1636577}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elephantselfawareness&gt;{{cite news | title = Elephants' Jumbo Mirror Ability | publisher = BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6100430.stm | access-date = 2007-10-31 | date=2006-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Eurasian magpie]] (''Pica pica''): The Eurasian magpie is the first non-mammal to have passed the mirror test. Researchers applied a small red, yellow or black sticker to the throat of five Eurasian magpies, where they could be seen by the bird only by using a mirror. The birds were then given a mirror. The feel of the sticker on their throats did not seem to alarm the magpies. However, when the birds with coloured stickers caught a glimpse of themselves in the mirror, they scratched at their throats—a clear indication that they recognised the image in the mirror as their own. Those that received a black sticker, invisible against the black neck feathers, did not react.&lt;ref name="Prior"&gt;{{cite journal

===Insects===
* In a Belgian study from 2015, published in a [[Predatory open-access publishing|predatory journal]], by an author known for other controversial reports, 23 out of 24 adult [[ants]] scratched at small blue dots painted on their [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|clypeus]] (part of their "face") when they were able to see the dot in a mirror. According to the purported results, the ants were individually tested and were from three species, ''[[Myrmica sabuleti]]'', ''[[Myrmica rubra]]'' and ''[[Myrmica ruginodis]]''. None of the ants scratched the clypeus when they had no mirror to see the dot. None tried to scratch the blue dot on the mirror. When they had a mirror and a brown dot similar to their own color, only one of thirty ants scratched the brown dot; researchers said she was darker than average so the dot was visible. They also reacted to the mirror itself. Even without dots, 30 out of 30 ants touched the mirror with legs, antennae and mouths, while 0 of 30 ants touched a clear glass divider, with ants on the other side. Ants a few days old did not react to the dots. These three species have limited eyesight, with 109–169 [[Ommatidium |facets]] per eye, and the authors suggest doing tests on ants with more facets (some have 3,000) and on bees.&lt;ref name="cammaerts"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cammaerts |first=Marie-Claire, and Roger Cammaerts |date=2015-07-01 |title=Are ants (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) capable of self recognition? |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6025/a64f817d6ef770e88449d9c0dea1a7a1c952.pdf |journal=Journal of Science |volume=5 |issue=7 |pages=521–532}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kulick"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kulick |first=Don |title=Human–Animal Communication |url=http://www.engagingvulnerability.se/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kulick_2017_Human-Animal_Comm.pdf |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=357–378 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102116-041723|year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="agro"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=De Agrò |first=Massimo |last2=Regolin |first2=Lucia |last3=Moretto |first3=Enzo |title=Visual Discrimination Learning in the Jumping Spider Phidippus regius |url=http://animalbehaviorandcognition.org/uploads/journals/17/AB&amp;C_2017_Vol4(4)_De%20Agro_et_al.pdf |journal=Animal Behavior and Cognition |language=en |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=413–424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals that have failed==
A range of species have been exposed to mirrors.  Although these might have failed the classic MSR test, they have sometimes shown mirror-related behaviour:

* [[Giant panda]] (''Ailuropoda melanoleuca''): In one study, 34 captive giant pandas of a wide range of ages were tested.  None of the pandas responded to the mark and many reacted aggressively towards the mirror, causing the researchers to consider the pandas viewed their reflection as a [[conspecific]].&lt;ref name="Panda"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ma, X., Jin, Y., Luo, B., Zhang, G., Wei, R. and Liu, D.|year=2015|title=Giant pandas failed to show mirror self-recognition|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=18|issue=3|pages=713–721|doi=10.1007/s10071-015-0838-4|pmid=25609263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This could also explain why only gorillas with extensive human interaction and a certain degree of separation from other gorillas and usual gorilla behaviour are more predisposed to passing the test.&lt;ref name="The Great Ape Project" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kind" /&gt;

Two captive giant manta rays showed frequent, unusual and repetitive movements in front of a mirror suggested contingency checking.  They also showed unusual self-directed behaviours when exposed to the mirror.&lt;ref name="Ari"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ari, C. and D’Agostino, D.P.|year=2016|title=Contingency checking and self-directed behaviors in giant manta rays: Do elasmobranchs have self-awareness?|journal=Journal of Ethology|volume=34|issue=2|pages=167–174|doi=10.1007/s10164-016-0462-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses for mirrors==
Primates, other than the great apes, have so far universally failed the mirror test. However, mirror tests with three species of [[gibbon]] (''Hylobates syndactylus'', ''H.gabriellae'', ''H. leucogenys'') have shown convincing evidence of self-recognition despite the fact that the animals failed the standard version of the mirror test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ujhelyi, M., Merker, B., Buk, P. and Geissmann, T.|year=2000|title=Observations on the behavior of gibbons (Hylobates leucogenys, H. gabriellae, and H. lar) in the presence of mirrors|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=114|issue=3|pages=253–262|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.114.3.253|pmid=10994841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rhesus macaque]]s have failed the MSR test, but use mirrors to study otherwise-hidden parts of their bodies, such as their genitals and the implants in their heads.  It has been suggested this demonstrates at least a partial self-awareness, although this is disputed.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news

[[Pig]]s can use visual information seen in a mirror to find food, and show evidence of self-recognition when presented with their reflection. In an experiment, 7 of the 8 pigs tested were able to find a bowl of food hidden behind a wall and revealed using a mirror. The eighth pig looked behind the mirror for the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Broom | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Sena | first2 = H. | last3 = Moynihan | first3 = K.

[[B. F. Skinner]] found that [[Pigeon]]s are capable of passing a highly modified mirror test after extensive training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1126/science.212.4495.695|last1 = Epstein, L., Skinner, R.P. and Skinner, B.F.|year = 1981|title = "Self-awareness" in the pigeon |url = |journal = Science |volume = 212 |issue = 4495|pages = 695–696 |pmid = 17739404 |bibcode = 1981Sci...212..695E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719225835/http://psychology.lafayette.edu/files/2010/06/selfaware.mov This is video of one such test]&lt;/ref&gt; In the experiment, a pigeon was [[Operant conditioning|trained]] to look in a mirror to find a response key behind it, which the pigeon then turned to peck to obtain food.  Thus, the pigeon learned to use a mirror to find critical elements of its environment. Next, the pigeon was trained to peck at dots placed on its feathers; food was, again, the consequence of touching the dot. The latter training was accomplished in the absence of the mirror. The final test was placing a small bib on the pigeon—enough to cover a dot placed on its lower belly. A control period without the mirror present yielded no pecking at the dot. When the mirror was revealed, the pigeon became active, looked in the mirror and then tried to peck on the dot under the bib. However, [[Animal training|untrained]] pigeons have never passed the mirror test.&lt;ref name="de Waal2008"&gt;{{cite journal | author = De Waal, F.B. | year = 2008 | title = The thief in the mirror | journal = PLOS Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 8| page = e201 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060201| pmid = 18715116 | pmc = 2517621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manta rays]] repeatedly swim in front of the mirror, turning over to show their undersides and moving their fins. When in front of the mirror, they  blow bubbles, an unusual behaviour. They do not try to socially interact with the mirror image, suggesting that they recognise that the mirror image is not another ray. However, a classic mirror test using marks on the rays’ bodies has yet to be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Amanda Pachniewska|year=2016|title=List of Animals That Have Passed the Mirror Test |  url = http://www.animalcognition.org/2015/04/15/list-of-animals-that-have-passed-the-mirror-test/|journal=Animalcognition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robots==
In 2012, early steps were taken to make a [[robot]] pass the mirror test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19354994 | title=Robot learns to recognise itself| work=BBC News| date=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The MSR test has been criticised for several reasons, in particular, because it may result in findings that are false negatives.&lt;ref name="Suddendorf" /&gt;

The MSR test may be of limited value when applied to species that primarily use senses other than vision.&lt;ref name="coren"/&gt;{{Verify source|date=January 2009}}  For example, dogs mainly use [[olfactory sense|olfaction]] and [[hearing|audition]]; vision is used only third. It is suggested this is why dogs fail the MSR test. With this in mind, the biologist [[Marc Bekoff]] developed a scent-based paradigm using [[dog urine]] to test self-recognition in canines.&lt;ref name="archer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coren"/&gt; He tested his own dog, but his results were inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201107/does-my-dog-recognize-himself-in-mirror | title=Does My Dog Recognize Himself in a Mirror?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dog cognition researcher Alexandra Horowitz formalized Bekoff's idea in a controlled experiment, reported on in 2016&lt;ref name="Horowitz"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/being-a-dog-following-the-dog-into-a-world-of-smell/oclc/955777362|title=Being a dog : following the dog into a world of smell|last=Horowitz |first=Alexandra |date=2016 |publisher=Scribner|isbn=9781476795997|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=Alexandra|date=2017|title=Smelling themselves: Dogs investigate their own odours longer when modified in an "olfactory mirror" test|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376635717300104|journal=Behavioural Processes|volume=143C|pages=17–24|doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2017.08.001|pmid=28797909}}&lt;/ref&gt; She compared the dogs' behavior when examining their own and others' odors, and also when examining their own odor with an added smell "mark" analogous to the visual mark in MSR tests. These subjects not only discriminated their own odor from that of other dogs, as Bekoff had found, but also spent more time investigating their own odor "image" when it was modified, as subjects who pass the MSR test do.&lt;ref name="the atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/can-dogs-smell-their-reflections/537219/|title= Can Dogs Smell Their 'Reflections'?|date=17 August 2017 |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cazzolla Gatti|first=Roberto|date=2016|title=Self-consciousness: beyond the looking-glass and what dogs found there|journal=Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=28|issue=2|pages=232–240|doi=10.1080/03949370.2015.1102777|issn=0394-9370}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested an ethological approach, the "Sniff test of self-recognition (STSR)" which may shed light on different ways of checking for self-recognition.

Another concern with the MSR test is that some species quickly respond aggressively to their mirror reflection as if it were a threatening conspecific thereby preventing the animal to calmly consider what the reflection actually represents.  It has been suggested this is the reason why gorillas and monkeys fail the MSR test.&lt;ref name="Couchman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Couchman, J.J.|year=2011|title=Self-agency in rhesus monkeys|journal=Biology Letters|pages=39–41|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2011/07/08/rsbl.2011.0536.short |doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2011.0536|pmid=21733868|volume=8|issue=1|pmc=3259954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Primatology|year=1984|volume=5|issue=1|pages=81–98|title=Monkeys with mirrors: Some questions for primate psychology|author=Anderson, J.R.|doi=10.1007/bf02735149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a MSR test, animals may not recognise the mark as abnormal, or, may not be sufficiently motivated to react to it.  However, this does not mean they are unable to recognise themselves. For example, in a MSR test conducted on three elephants, only one elephant passed the test but the two elephants that failed still demonstrated behaviours that can be interpreted as self-recognition. The researchers commented that the elephants might not have touched the mark because it was not important enough to them.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=kids-and-animals-who-fail-classic-mirror |title=Kids (and animals) who fail classic mirror tests may still have sense of self |date=29 November 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, lesser apes infrequently engage in self-grooming, which may explain their failure to touch a mark on their head in the mirror test.&lt;ref name="Suddendorf" /&gt;

Finally, it should be noted that there has been controversy over whether self-recognition implies self-awareness. The ant researchers state that many ants, from three species, pass the mirror test, but the researchers do not know that they have self-awareness.&lt;ref name="cammaerts" /&gt; Dogs recognize their own scent as different from others' scents,&lt;ref name="bekoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hearne"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Animal happiness : a moving exploration of animals and their emotions |last=Hearne |first=Vicki |date=2007 |publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub]] |isbn=9781602391673 |location=New York |oclc=785423631}}&lt;/ref&gt; but fail the mirror test.

==Rouge test==
[[File:Mirror baby.jpg|thumb|225px|A human child exploring his reflection]]
The ''rouge test'' is a version of the mirror test used with human children.&lt;ref name=Amsterdam&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/dev.420050403 |author=Beulah Amsterdam |title=Mirror self-image reactions before age two |journal=Developmental Psychobiology |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=297–305 |year=1972 |pmid=4679817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]] makeup, an experimenter surreptitiously places a dot on the face of the child. The child is then placed in front of a mirror and their reactions are monitored; depending on the child's development, distinct categories of responses are demonstrated. This test is widely cited as the primary measure for mirror self-recognition in human children.&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{cite book |title=Social cognition and the acquisition of self |last=Lewis |first=M. |author2=Brooks-Gunn, J. |year=1979 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-306-40232-6 |page= 296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Priel&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-0965(86)90038-X |author=Priel, Beatrice |author2=de Schonen, Scania |title=Self-Recognition: A Study of a Population without Mirrors |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=237–250 |year=1986 |pmid=3701250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sedikides&gt;Sedikides, C. &amp; Spencer, S.J. (Eds.) (2007). ''The Self''. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental reactions===
From the age of 6 to 12 months, the child typically sees a "sociable playmate" in the mirror's reflection. Self-admiring and embarrassment usually begin at 12 months, and at 14 to 20 months most children demonstrate avoidance behaviours.&lt;ref name="Amsterdam" /&gt; Finally, at 18 months half of children recognise the reflection in the mirror as their own&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; and by 20 to 24 months self-recognition climbs to 65%. Children do so by evincing mark-directed behaviour; they touch their own nose or try to wipe the mark off.&lt;ref name="Amsterdam" /&gt;

It appears that self-recognition in mirrors is independent of familiarity with reflecting surfaces.&lt;ref name=Priel/&gt; In some cases the rouge test has been shown to have differing results, depending on sociocultural orientation. For example, a [[Nso people|Cameroonian Nso]] sample of infants 18 to 20 months of age had an extremely low amount of self-recognition outcomes at 3.2%. The study also found two strong predictors of self-recognition: object stimulation (maternal effort of attracting the attention of the infant to an object either person touched) and mutual eye contact.&lt;ref name=Keller&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heidi Keller |author2=Relindis Yovsi |author3=Joern Borke |author4=Joscha Kärtner |author5=Henning Jensen |author6=Zaira Papaligoura  |title=Developmental Consequences of Early Parenting Experiences: Self-Recognition and Self-Regulation in Three Cultural Communities |journal=Child Development |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=1745–1760 |year=2004|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00814.x |pmid=15566377 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong correlation between self-concept and [[object permanence]] have also been demonstrated using the rouge test.&lt;ref name=Bertenthal&gt;{{cite journal |author=BENNETT I. BERTENTHAL |author2=KURT W. FISCHER |title=Development of Self-Recognition in the Infant |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=14 |pages=44–50 |year= 1978 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.14.1.44 |url=http://www.gse.harvard.edu/~ddl/articlesCopy/BertenthalFischerDevtSelfRecog.DevPsy1978.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript |citeseerx=10.1.1.550.1903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications===
The rouge test is a measure of [[self-concept]]; the child who touches the rouge on his own nose upon looking into a mirror demonstrates the basic ability to understand self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/dev.420050403 | pmid=4679817 | volume=5 | issue=4 | title=Mirror self-image reactions before age two | year=1972 | journal=Dev Psychobiol | pages=297–305 | author=Amsterdam B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7FK3AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=Butterworth,+1992#v=onepage&amp;q=Butterworth%2C%201992&amp;f=false|title=Self-awareness in the first few weeks of life|work=|accessdate=November 4, 2017|isbn=9781136872006|last1=Brown|first1=Jonathon|date=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Social Psychology, 6th Edition p68-69&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals,&lt;ref name="coren"&gt;{{cite book |title=How Dogs Think |author=Stanley Coren |isbn=978-0-7432-2232-7|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; young children,&lt;ref name="palmer"&gt;[http://www.ulm.edu/~palmer/ConsciousnessandtheSymbolicUniverse.htm "Consciousness and the Symbolic Universe"]&lt;/ref&gt; and people who have their sight restored after being blind from birth,&lt;ref name="archer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Archer |first=John |year=1992 |title=Ethology and Human Development|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-389-20996-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes react to their reflection in the mirror as though it were another individual.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Theorists have remarked on the significance of this period in a child's life. For example, [[psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]] used a similar test in marking the [[mirror stage]] when growing up.&lt;ref name="Lacan"&gt;Lacan, J., ''Some reflections on the Ego'' in ''Écrits'', org. published 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Current views of the [[self (psychology)|self in psychology]] position the self as playing an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and [[social identity]].&lt;ref name="Sedikides" /&gt;

=== Methodological flaws ===
There is some debate as to the interpretation of the results of the mirror test,&lt;ref name="coren"/&gt; and researchers in one study have identified some potential problems with the test as a means of gauging self-awareness in young children and animals.&lt;ref name="Asendorpf"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.32.2.313 |author=Asendorpf, J.B., Warkentin V. and Baudonniere, P.|title=Self-awareness and other-awareness II: Mirror self-recognition, social contingency awareness, and synchronic imitation |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=32 |pages=313–321 |year=1996 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposing that a self-recognising child or animal may not demonstrate mark-directed behaviour because they are not motivated to clean up their faces, thus providing incorrect results, the study compared results of the standard rouge test methodology against a modified version of the test.&lt;ref name=Asendorpf /&gt;

In the classic test, the experimenter first played with the children, making sure that they looked in the mirror at least three times. Then, the rouge test was performed using a dot of rouge below the child's right eye. For their modified testing, the experimenter introduced a doll with a rouge spot under its eye and asked the child to help clean the doll. The experimenter would ask up to three times before cleaning the doll themselves. The doll was then put away, and the mirror test performed using a rouge dot on the child's face. These modifications were shown to increase the number of self-recognisers.&lt;ref name="Asendorpf" /&gt;

The results uncovered by this study at least suggest some issues with the classic mirror test; primarily, that it assumes that children will recognise the dot of rouge as abnormal and attempt to examine or remove it. The classic test may have produced false negatives, because the child's recognition of the dot did not lead to them cleaning it. In their modified test, in which the doll was cleaned first, they found a stronger relationship between cleaning the doll's face and the child cleaning its own face. The demonstration with the doll, postulated to demonstrate to the children what to do, may lead to more reliable confirmation of self-recognition.&lt;ref name="Asendorpf" /&gt;

On a more general level, it remains debatable whether recognition of one's mirror image implies self-awareness.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Likewise, the converse may also be false—one may hold self-awareness, but not present a positive result in a mirror test.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2980">In [[geometry and topology]], it is a usual axiom of a [[manifold]] to be a [[Hausdorff space]]. In [[general topology]], this axiom is relaxed, and one studies '''non-Hausdorff manifolds''': spaces [[locally homeomorphic]] to [[Euclidean space]], but not necessarily Hausdorff.

==Examples==

===Line with two origins===
The most familiar non-Hausdorff manifold is the '''line with two origins''', or '''bug-eyed line'''.

This is the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of two copies of the real line
:'''R''' × {''a''} and '''R''' × {''b''}
with the [[equivalence relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;(x,a) \sim (x,b)\text{ if }x \neq 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This space has a single point for each nonzero real number ''r'' and two points 0&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; and 0&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;.  A local base of open neighborhoods of &lt;math&gt;0_a&lt;/math&gt; in this space can be thought to consist of sets of the form &lt;math&gt;\{r\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}\vert-\varepsilon&lt;r&lt;\varepsilon\}\cup\{0_a\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is any positive real number.  A similar description of a local base of open neighborhoods of &lt;math&gt;0_b&lt;/math&gt; is possible. Thus, in this space all neighbourhoods of 0&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; intersect all neighbourhoods of 0&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;, so it is non-Hausdorff.

Further, the line with two origins does not have the homotopy type of a [[CW-complex]], or of any Hausdorff space.&lt;ref&gt;Gabard, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Branching line===
Similar to the line with two origins is the '''branching line'''.

This is the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of two copies of the real line
:'''R''' × {''a''} and '''R''' × {''b''}
with the [[equivalence relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;(x,a) \sim (x,b)\text{ if }x &lt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This space has a single point for each negative real number ''r'' and two points &lt;math&gt;x_a, x_b&lt;/math&gt; for every non-negative number: it has a "fork" at zero.

===Etale space===
The [[etale space]] of a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]], such as the sheaf of continuous real functions over a manifold, is a manifold that is often non-Hausdorff. (The etale space is Hausdorff if it is a sheaf of functions with some sort of [[analytic continuation]] property.){{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Quantum path integration (sum over histories)===
Mark F. Sharlow claims that functional spacetime of [[Path integration|path integral]] has a "branching" non-Hausdorff structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mark F. Sharlow|title=The quantum mechanical path integral: toward a realistic interpretation|url=https://www.eskimo.com/~msharlow/path.pdf|date=2005–2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Nothing'''", used as a pronoun subject, denotes the absence of a [[Something (concept)|something]] or particular thing that one might expect or desire to be present ("We found nothing," "Nothing was there") or the inactivity of a thing or things that are usually or could be active ("Nothing moved," "Nothing happened").  As a predicate or complement "nothing" denotes the absence of meaning, value, worth, relevance, standing, or [[importance|significance]] ("It is a tale/ Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/ Signifying nothing"; "The affair meant nothing"; "I'm nothing in their eyes").&lt;ref name=MWD&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nothing "Nothing"], ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;  "'''Nothingness'''" is a philosophical term that denotes the general state of [[nonexistence]], sometimes reified as a domain or dimension into which things pass when they cease to exist or out of which they may come to exist, e.g., God is understood to have created the universe ''ex nihilo'', "out of nothing."&lt;ref name=MWD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;definition of suffix "-ness" - ''"the state of being"'', Yourdictionary.com, [www.yourdictionary.com/ness-suffix]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
===Western philosophy===
Some would consider the study of "nothing" to be foolish. A typical response of this type is voiced by [[Giacomo Casanova]] (1725–1798) in conversation with his landlord, one Dr. Gozzi, who also happens to be a priest:

{{cquote|As everything, for him, was an article of faith, nothing, to his mind, was difficult to understand: the Great Flood had covered the entire world; before, men had the misfortune of living a thousand years; God conversed with them; Noah had taken one hundred years to build the ark; while the earth, suspended in air, stood firmly at the center of the universe that God had created out of nothingness.  When I said to him, and proved to him, that the existence of nothingness was absurd, he cut me short, calling me silly.&lt;ref&gt;Giacomo Casanova, ''The Story of My Life'', p. 29, translators: Stephen Sartarelli, Sophie Hawkes, Penguin Classics, 2001 {{ISBN|0-14-043915-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, "nothingness" has been treated as a serious subject for a very long time.  In philosophy, to avoid linguistic traps over the meaning of "nothing",  a phrase such as ''not-being'' is often employed to make clear what is being discussed.

====Parmenides====
One of the earliest Western philosophers to consider nothing as a concept was [[Parmenides]] (5th century BC), who was a Greek philosopher of the [[monist]] school.  He argued that "nothing" cannot exist by the following line of reasoning: To speak of a thing, one has to speak of a thing that exists.  Since we can speak of a thing in the past, this thing must still exist (in some sense) now, and from this he concludes that there is no such thing as change.  As a corollary, there can be no such things as ''coming-into-being'', ''passing-out-of-being'', or ''not-being''.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 66–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parmenides was taken seriously by other philosophers, influencing, for instance, [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle gives Parmenides serious consideration but concludes; "Although these opinions seem to follow logically in a dialectical discussion, yet to believe them seems next door to madness when one considers the facts."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''On Generation and Corruption'', '''I''':8, 350 BC, translator H. H. Joachim, The Internet Classics Archive, [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/gener_corr.1.i.html retrieved] 24 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, [[Albert Einstein]]'s concept of [[spacetime]] has led many scientists, including Einstein himself, to adopt a position remarkably similar to Parmenides.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''The World of Parmenides: Essays on the Presocratic Enlightenment'', p. 172, Routledge, 2013 {{ISBN|1317835018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the death of his friend [[Michele Besso]], Einstein consoled his widow with the words "Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me.  That signifies nothing.  For those of us that believe in physics, the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion." &lt;ref&gt;[[Gary R. Mar|Gary Mar]], "Gödel's ontological dream", ch. 36 in Shyam Wuppuluri, Giancarlo Ghirardi (eds), ''Space, Time and the Limits of Human Understanding'', p. 469, Springer, 2016 {{ISBN|3319444182}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Leucippus=====
[[Leucippus]] (early 5th century BC), one of the [[atomists]], along with other philosophers of his time, made attempts to reconcile this monism with the everyday observation of motion and change.  He accepted the [[monist]] position that there could be no motion without a void.  The void is the opposite of being. It is ''not-being''.  On the other hand, there exists [[Something_(concept)|something]] known as an absolute [[wikt:plenum|plenum]], a space filled with matter, and there can be no motion in a plenum because it is completely full.  But, there is not just one monolithic plenum, for existence consists of a multiplicity of plenums.  These are the invisibly small "atoms" of Greek atomist theory, later expanded by [[Democritus]] (circa 460 BC – 370 BC), which allows the void to "exist" between them.  In this scenario, macroscopic objects can ''come-into-being'', move through space, and pass into ''not-being'' by means of the coming together and moving apart of their constituent atoms.  The void must exist to allow this to happen, or else the "frozen world" of Parmenides must be accepted.

[[Bertrand Russell]] points out that this does not exactly defeat the argument of Parmenides but, rather, ignores it by taking the rather modern scientific position of starting with the observed data (motion, etc.) and constructing a theory based on the data, as opposed to Parmenides' attempts to work from pure logic.  Russell also observes that both sides were mistaken in believing that there can be no motion in a plenum, but arguably motion cannot ''start'' in a plenum.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cyril Bailey notes that Leucippus is the first to say that a "thing" (the void) might be real without being a body and points out the irony that this comes from a materialistic atomist.  Leucippus is  therefore the first to say that "nothing" has a reality attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Bailey, ''The Greek Atomists and Epicurus: A Study'', pp. 75–76, The Clarendon Press, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aristotle, Newton, Descartes====
[[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) provided the classic escape from the logical problem posed by Parmenides by distinguishing things that are ''matter'' and things that are ''space''.  In this scenario, space is not "nothing" but, rather, a receptacle in which objects of matter can be placed.  The true void (as "nothing") is different from "space" and is removed from consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Categories'', '''I''':6, 350 BC, translator, E. M. Edghill, The Internet Classics Archive [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.1.1.html retrieved] 24 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Categories'', '''III''':7, 350 BC, translator, J. L. Stocks, The Internet Classics Archive [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/heavens.3.iii.html retrieved] 24 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This characterisation of space reached its pinnacle with [[Isaac Newton]] who asserted the existence of absolute space.

[[René Descartes]], on the other hand, returned to a Parmenides-like argument of denying the existence of space.  For Descartes, there was matter, and there was extension of matter leaving no room for the existence of "nothing".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that space can actually be empty was generally still not accepted by philosophers who invoked arguments similar to the plenum reasoning.  Although Descartes views on this were challenged by [[Blaise Pascal]], he declined to overturn the traditional belief, ''[[Horror vacui (physics)|horror vacui]]'', commonly stated as "nature abhors a vacuum".  This remained so until [[Evangelista Torricelli]] invented the [[barometer]] in 1643 and showed that an empty space appeared if the mercury tube was turned upside down.  This phenomenon being known as the Torricelli vacuum and the unit of vacuum pressure, the [[torr]], being named after him.  Even Torricelli's teacher, the famous [[Galileo Galilei]] had previously been unable to adequately explain the sucking action of a pump.&lt;ref&gt;Pieper, pp. 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt;

====John the Scot====
John the Scot, or [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] (c. 815–877) held many surprisingly heretical beliefs for the time he lived in for which no action appears ever to have been taken against him.  His ideas mostly stem from, or are based on his work of translating [[pseudo-Dionysius]].  His beliefs are essentially [[pantheist]] and he classifies evil, amongst many other things, into ''not-being''.  This is done on the grounds that evil is the opposite of good, a quality of God, but God can have no opposite, since God is everything in the pantheist view of the world.  Similarly, the idea that God created the world out of "nothing" is to be interpreted as meaning that the "nothing" here is synonymous with God.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 396–401.&lt;/ref&gt;

====G. W. F. Hegel====
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) is the philosopher who brought the [[dialectic]]al method to a new pinnacle of development.  According to Hegel in ''[[Science of Logic]]'', the dialectical methods consists of three steps.  First, a thesis is given, which can be any [[proposition]] in [[logic]].  Second, the antithesis of the thesis is formed and, finally, a synthesis incorporating both thesis and antithesis.  Hegel believed that no proposition taken by itself can be completely true.  Only the whole can be true, and the dialectical synthesis was the means by which the whole could be examined in relation to a specific proposition.  Truth consists of the whole process. Separating out thesis, antithesis, or synthesis as a stand-alone statement results in something that is in some way or other untrue.  The concept of "nothing" arises in Hegel right at the beginning of his ''Logic''.  The whole is called by Hegel the "Absolute" and is to be viewed as something spiritual.  Hegel then has:&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 701–704.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thesis]]: The Absolute is Pure Being
* [[Antithesis]]: The Absolute is Nothing
* [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|Synthesis]]: The Absolute is Becoming

====Existentialists====
The most prominent figure among the [[existentialism|existentialists]] is [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], whose ideas in his book ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (''L'être et le néant'') are heavily influenced by ''[[Being and Time]]'' (''Sein und Zeit'') of [[Martin Heidegger]], although Heidegger later stated that he was misunderstood by Sartre.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, "Letter on 'Humanism'," ''Pathmarks'' (Cambridge &amp; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 250–251.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sartre defines two kinds of "being" (être).  One kind is ''être-en-soi'', the brute existence of things such as a tree.  The other kind is ''être-pour-soi'' which is consciousness.  Sartre claims that this second kind of being is "nothing" since consciousness cannot be an object of consciousness and can possess no essence.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Solomon, ''From Hegel to Existentialism'', pp. 286-287, Oxford University Press US, 1989, {{ISBN|0-19-506182-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sartre, and even more so, [[Jaques Lacan]], use this conception of nothing as the foundation of their atheist philosophy. Equating nothingness with being leads to creation from nothing and hence God is no longer needed for there to be existence.&lt;ref&gt;Conor Cunningham, ''A Genealogy of Nihilism: Philosophies of Nothing and the Difference of Theology'', pp. 251–255, Routledge, 2002 {{ISBN|0-415-27694-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern philosophy===
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}
The understanding of 'nothing' varies widely between cultures, especially between Western and Eastern cultures and philosophical traditions. For instance, ''[[Śūnyatā]]'' (emptiness), unlike "nothingness", is considered to be a [[Philosophy of mind|state of mind]] in some forms of [[Buddhism]] (see [[Nirvana]], [[mu (negative)|mu]], and [[Bodhi]]). Achieving 'nothing' as a state of mind in this tradition allows one to be totally focused on a thought or activity at a level of intensity that they would not be able to achieve if they were [[consciousness|consciously]] thinking. A classic example of this is an archer attempting to erase the mind and clear the thoughts to better focus on the shot. Some authors have pointed to similarities between the Buddhist conception of nothingness and the ideas of Martin Heidegger and existentialists like Sartre,&lt;ref&gt;Steven William Laycock, ''Nothingness and Emptiness: A Buddhist Engagement with the Ontology of Jean-Paul Sartre'', SUNY Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0-7914-4909-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles B. Guignon, ''The Cambridge Companion to Heidegger'', pp. 293–325, Cambridge University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-521-82136-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although this connection has not been explicitly made by the philosophers themselves.

In some [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophies]], the concept of "nothingness" is characterized by an [[Egolessness|egoless]] state of being in which one fully realizes one's own small part in the cosmos.

The [[Kyoto School]] handles the concept of nothingness as well.

==Computing==
{{See also|Ternary logic}}

In [[computing]], "nothing" can be a [[Keyword (computer programming)|keyword]] (in [[VB.Net]]) used in place of something unassigned, a [[data abstraction]]. Although a computer's storage hardware always contains numbers, "nothing" symbolizes a number skipped by the system when the programmer desires. Many systems have similar capabilities but different keywords, such as "[[Nullable type|null]]" (e.g. [[SQL]]), "[[Null character|NUL]]", "[[nil (disambiguation)#Computer programming|nil]]", and "None" ([[Python (programming language)|Python]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/c-api/none.html |title=The None Object — Python v2.7.1 documentation |publisher=Docs.python.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To instruct a computer [[Central processing unit|processor]] to do nothing, a keyword such as "[[NOP (code)|NOP]]" may be available. This is a [[control abstraction]]; a processor that executes NOP will behave identically to a processor that does not process this directive.&lt;ref name=arm-manual&gt;[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0041c/Caccegih.html NOP - ARM Software Developer Toolkit Reference Guide].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paraméshwara''' ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]'': Parameśvara, [[Sanskrit]]:'' परमेश्वर) or '''Paramashiva''' is the term usually referred to god [[Shiva]] as the [[God|Supreme being]] according to [[Saivism]] which is one of 4 major [[sampradaya]] of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="nisar"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=qJoDkoxS_vwC | title=Nectar of Immortality: Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj's Discourses on the Eternal Front | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publications | author=[[Nisargadatta Maharaj]] | year=Jan 30, 2003 | pages=183 | isbn=9788120819481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vivek"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=m5jXAAAAMAAJ | title=Brahmanism | author=Swami Vivekananda | journal=Prabuddha Bharata: Or Awakened India | year=2007 | volume=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC&amp;pg=PA229 | title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism | publisher=Infobase Publishing | author=Constance Jones, James D.

== Etymology ==
The word is a compound of the Sanskrit words ''parama'' meaning 'highest' and [[wikt:ईश्वर|ईश्वर]] ''īśvára'' meaning 'lord'. Thus Parameshvara literally means 'highest supreme ruler '. Similarly, the word Paramashiva (Parama + Shiva) means 'Shiva in his highest nature'. These two words are simultaneously used in Saivite texts as synonyms for [[Parabrahman]], the Indian equivalent of Supreme being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=UL4BAAAAMAAJ | title=Jammu and Kashmir (India) | author=Shri Parmananda Research Institute | journal=Glimpses of Kashmiri Culture | year=1982 | volume=5 | pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, other traditions of Hinduism such as [[Vedanta]] and [[Vaishnavism]] also use the term Parameshwara as a synonym of Parabrahman within their philosophical perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=mBMxPdgrBhoC | title=The Hare Krishna Movement: The Postcharismatic Fate of a Religious Transplant | publisher=Columbia University Press | author=Edwin Bryant, Maria Ekstrand | year=2004 | pages=133 | isbn=9780231508438}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=h7PWAAAAMAAJ | title=Vedanta: Concepts and Application | publisher=Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture | year=2000 | pages=31 | isbn=9788187332022}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== According to Kashmir Shaivism == 
[[File:Tattvas36.gif|thumb|Paramashiva is the ultimate reality who either (according to Kashmir Shaivism) construct himself or (according to Shaiva siddhanta) beyond  36 tattvas, the whole elements of reality.]]

Kashmiri Shaivism describes all of reality, with all of its diversity and fluctuation, is the play of the single principle, Paramashiva. The two aspects of this single reality are inseparably united: Shiva and Shakti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?isbn=1438108737 | title=Critical Companion to George Orwell | publisher=Infobase Publishing | author=Edward Quinn | year=2014 | pages=229 | isbn=9781438108735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramashiva ''appears'' as the world through his creative power, Shakti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?isbn=0595527515 | title=The Divine Universe | publisher=iUniverse | author=Swami Abhayananda | year=2008 | pages=95 | isbn=9780595527519}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ontological nature of Paramashiva is beyond human knowledge and articulation, yet it can be experienced directly through mystical intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=8ErhIBHJEkwC | title=Kashmir Shaivaism | publisher=SUNY Press | author=Jagadish Chandra Chatterji | year=1914 | pages=viii | isbn=9780887061790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== According to Saiva Siddhanta==
{{Main|Shaiva Siddhanta}}
Shaiva siddanta accepts the existence of ''Tripathartham''  (three entities), pati -  the supreme being Paramashiva, pashu - all atmans and pasam - three bondages of [[Anava]], [[Karma]], [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. As the supreme being Parameshwara only has the distinct eight characters or predecates which are applied to distinguish him with the other two entities of Saiva Siddhanta - [[Atman (Hinduism)|Pashu]] and [[Pasam (Saivism)|Pasam]]. They are ''sarvajnatva'' (who knows everything), ''nityatrptatva'' (with infinite happiness), ''anādibōdha'' (without bondages), ''Svatantratva'' (independent),  ''aluptashakti'' (unlimited mercy), ''anantashakti'' (unrestricted grace), ''nirāmayatma'' (wholesome) and ''Visuddhadēha'' (with pure body).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=I1blW4-yY20C | title=Śaivism in Philosophical Perspective: A Study of the Formative Concepts, Problems, and Methods of Śaiva Siddhānta | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publications | author=K. Sivaraman | year=1973 | pages=526 | isbn=9788120817715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaiva siddhanta states that Parameshwara in two states - ''tatasta lakshanam'', the form of lord that is moving through [[Tattva (Shaivism)|36 tattvas]] and ''Svarupa Lakshanam'', the pure form of supreme being beyond everything.&lt;ref name="jayandra"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=a_Z2zttoy_cC | title=Philosophical Anthropology in Śaiva Siddhānta: With Special Reference to Śivāgrayogin | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ., | author=Jayandra Soni | year=1989 | pages=58 | isbn=9788120806320}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two forms can be compared with the Saguna and Nirguna definitions on [[Para brahman]] of Vedantic tradition. When he is defined with tatasta lakshanam, Paramashiva exists in nine divine forms, [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], [[Rudra]], [[Maheshwara]], [[Sadasiva]], Sivam, Shakti, Nadam, Bindhu in which he is beyond words in his last four formless manifestations known as "Arupa". First five are his manifestations with forms and known as ''rupa''. Sadasiva is his mixed form of rupa and arupa which is often identified with [[Lingam]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Essentials of Hinduism in the Light of Šaiva Siddhānta | publisher=Meykandan Press | author=S. Sabaratna Mudaliyar | year=1913 | pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sivam and sakthi exist as inseparable Nada-bindu in the state of Svarupa Lakshanam in which they are often identified the non-dual supreme being Paramashiva and [[Adi Parashakti|Parashakti]]. Since they are inseparable and undifferentiated, Saiva siddhanta sees them as single oneness, Parameshwara.

'''Passive-aggressive behavior''' is characterized by indirect resistance to the demands of others and an avoidance of direct confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Passive–aggressive|title=Passive–aggressive {{!}} Definition of Passive–aggressive|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality disorder==
{{main|Passive-aggressive personality disorder}}
The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] [[DSM-IV|revision IV (DSM-IV)]] describes [[passive-aggressive personality disorder]] as a "pervasive pattern of negativistic attitudes and passive resistance to demands for adequate performance in social and occupational situations."

Passive-aggressiveness may not be necessarily a [[personality disorder]]. Personality disorder includes deviation in affectivity, cognition, control over impulses and need for gratification, ways of perceiving and thinking, and inflexible, maladaptive, or otherwise dysfunctional behaviour. There must be [[personal distress]] attributable to such behaviour. Deviation must be stable and of long duration.

==Concept in different areas==

===Psychology===
In psychology, passive-aggressive behavior is characterized by a habitual pattern of non-active resistance to expected work requirements, opposition, sullenness, stubbornness, and negative attitudes in response to requirements for normal performance levels expected by others. Most frequently it occurs in the workplace, where resistance is exhibited by indirect behaviors as procrastination, [[forgetfulness]], and purposeful inefficiency, especially in reaction to demands by [[authority figure]]s, but it can also occur in [[interpersonal]] contexts.&lt;ref name=dsmiv734&gt;{{cite book|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV|year=2000|publisher=American Psychiatic Association|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0890420629|pages=733–734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source characterizes passive-aggressive behavior as: "a personality trait marked by a pervasive pattern of negative attitudes and characterized by passive, sometimes obstructionist resistance to complying with expectations in interpersonal or occupational situations. Behaviors: learned helplessness, procrastination, stubbornness, resentment, sullenness, or deliberate/repeated failure to accomplish requested tasks for which one is (often explicitly) responsible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Passive–aggressive%20personality%20disorder-diagnostic%20criteria|title=Passive–aggressive personality disorder-diagnostic criteria|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples of passive-aggressive behavior might include avoiding direct or clear communication, evading problems, fear of intimacy or competition, making excuses, blaming others, obstructionism, "playing the victim", feigning compliance with requests, sarcasm, backhanded compliments, and hiding anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/counsellor-articles/what-is-Passive–aggressive-behaviour|title=What is Passive Aggressive Behaviour?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/Passive–aggressive-diaries/201011/10-things-Passive–aggressive-people-say|title=10 Things Passive–aggressive People Say|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict theory===
In [[conflict theory]], passive-aggressive behavior can resemble a behavior better described as [[wiktionary:catty|catty]], as it consists of deliberate, active, but carefully veiled hostile acts which are distinctively different in character from the non-assertive style of passive resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Simon|first=George|title=In Sheep's Clothing: Understanding and Dealing with Manipulative People|year=2010|publisher=Parkhurst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Work ===
{{Main|Workplace conflict}}
Passive-aggressive behavior from workers and managers is damaging to team unity and productivity. In the ad for Warner's online ebook, it says: "The worst case of passive-aggressive behavior involves destructive attitudes such as negativity, sullenness, resentment, procrastination, 'forgetting' to do something, chronic lateness, and intentional inefficiency." {{fact|date=February 2018}} If this behavior is ignored it could result in decreased office efficiency and frustration among workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Harms | first = Kimberly A. | title = Passive Aggressive Behaviour in the Dental Office | edition = 3 |date=May–June 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If managers are passive-aggressive in their behavior, it can end up stifling team creativity. De Angelis says, "It would actually make perfect sense that those promoted to leadership positions might often be those who on the surface appear to be agreeable, diplomatic and supportive, yet who are actually dishonest, backstabbing saboteurs behind the scenes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = De Angelis | first = Paula | title = Blindsided: Recognizing and Dealing with Passive–aggressive Leadership in the Workplace | page = 3 | year = 2009 | isbn = 1442159200 |publisher = CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Passive-aggressive behavior was first defined clinically by Colonel [[William Menninger]] during [[World War II]] in the context of men's reaction to military compliance. Menninger described soldiers who were not openly defiant but expressed their aggressiveness "by passive measures, such as pouting, stubbornness, procrastination, inefficiency, and passive obstructionism" due to what Menninger saw as an "immaturity" and a reaction to "routine military stress".&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{Citation|last = Lane | first=C |title=The Surprising History of Passive–aggressive Personality Disorder|journal=Theory &amp; Psychology|date=1 February 2009|volume=19|issue=1|pages=55–70|doi= 10.1177/0959354308101419| format = [[PDF]] | url = https://sites.northwestern.edu/christopher-lane/files/2016/08/lanedocpapd2009-24w8s9n.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] views, noncompliance is not indicative of true passive-aggressive behavior, which may instead be defined as the manifestation of emotions that have been repressed based on a self-imposed need for acceptance.

'''''Philosophical Inquiries into the Essence of Human Freedom''''' ({{lang-de|Philosophische Untersuchungen über das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit und die damit zusammenhängenden Gegenstände}}) is an 1809 work by [[Friedrich Schelling]]. It was the last book he finished in his lifetime, running to some 90 pages of a single long essay. It is commonly referred to as his "''Freiheitsschrift''" (freedom text) or "freedom essay".

Described by [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] as "the most titanic work of German idealism",&lt;ref&gt;John Laughland, ''Schelling Versus Hegel: From German Idealism to Christian Metaphysics'' (2007), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; it is also seen as anticipating much of the collection of basic [[Existentialism|existentialist]] motifs. Its ambitions were high: to tackle the problem of [[radical evil]], and to innovate at a metaphysical level, in particular to correct [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. As its title suggests, it intends to give an account of [[human freedom]], and the requirements on the philosophical side to protect this idea from particular formulations, at issue during the period, of [[determinism]].

==Influences on Schelling==

The literature on the history of philosophy contains many assertions about the general influences on Schelling. There are also more specific comments about other thinkers and traditions that had a definite effect on this transitional work. The opening pages make it clear that Schelling is engaged in arguing against [[Spinozism]], a position which (often simply called "dogmatism") had been a target for both philosophical and religious thinkers in Germany for decades. Schelling was not concerned about rejecting all that [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s thought implied, in the terms of that debate, but to salvage something from the unification of view ([[monism]]) that came with it, while allowing room for freedom.

At this time Schelling was influenced also by [[Franz Xaver von Baader]] and the writings of [[Jakob Böhme]]. In fact ''Of Human Freedom'' contains explicit references to Baader's doctrine of [[evil]], and Böhme's schematic creation myths, and uses the term [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]; a detailed mapping of Böhme's thought onto Schelling's argument in the ''Freiheitsschrift'' has been carried out by Paola Mayer.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer pp. 197-209.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand Robert Schneider and Ernst Benz have argued for the more direct influence of the pietist [[Johann Albrecht Bengel]] and theosophist [[Friedrich Christoph Oetinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Alexander Magee (2001), ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', pp. 79-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

Explicit concerns of Schelling in the book are: the existence of evil and the emergence into reason. Schelling offers a solution to the first, an old theological chestnut, in brief that “evil makes arbitrary choice possible”. On the other hand, by no means all interpretations of the work come from the direction of theology and the [[problem of evil]]. The second idea, requiring a rationale of [[emergence]], was more innovative, because of the place it gave to [[irrationalism]] and [[anthropomorphism]], within the "cosmic" setting (which need not be taken literally). The work stands also in relation to a decade of previous publications, formulations, and rivalries.

A view from the nineteenth century is that of [[Harald Høffding]] (who sets the book in the context of a supposed personal crisis and philosophical block):

{{cquote|... [Schelling] attempts to show that we are only justified in conceiving God as a personal being if we posit an original antithesis within the absolute, within the essence of the Deity,&amp;mdash;a dark irrational ground which becomes purified and harmonised ... in the course of the life-development of the Divine Being. [...] All evil consists in a striving to return to the chaos out of which the order of Nature has proceeded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harald Høffding]], ''History of Modern Philosophy'' (1900 translation), vol. II p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Modern readings of Schelling's intentions can differ quite widely from this interpretation (and each other). This writing of Schelling is also seen as the beginning of his critique of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], and an announcement of a transitional moment in philosophy; part of the purpose was self-justification, verging on polemic in defence of Schelling's [[panentheism]]. It is therefore a signpost marking a fork in the road for what is now called "classical German philosophy": even if it had its time of dominance, [[absolute idealism]] in Hegel's sense is (after the "freedom essay") just one branch of the discussion of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] in [[German idealism]]. Hegel became a system-builder while Schelling produced no systematic or finished philosophy in three decades after the ''Freiheitsschrift''.

===Evil as radical===

The conception of evil is set against both the [[Neoplatonic]] ''[[privatio boni]]'' and the [[Manichaean]] division into two disconnected and contending powers. Evil must be seen as active, in both God and natural creatures. There is a distinction: in God evil can never stray out of its place (at the base), while in man it certainly may exceed its role of basing self-hood.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer pp. 198-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavoj Žižek]] writes that the central tenet is that

{{cquote|...if one is to account for the possibility of Evil, one has to presuppose a split in the Absolute into God insofar as he fully exists, and the obscure, impenetrable Ground of his Existence.&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek, ''The Abyss of Freedom'' p. 5, in ''The Abyss of Freedom/Ages of the World'' (1997) (with Judith Norman, translator)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John W. Cooper writes

{{cquote|Either Evil is unreal or God is its cause. Schelling's solution to this perennial problem is to view God's freedom as the possibility of evil and human freedom as responsible for the actuality of evil.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Cooper, ''Panentheism: The Other God of the Philosophers'' (2006), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Spinoza and pantheism===

At the time of writing the ''Freiheitschrift'', Schelling had on his mind an accusation of [[pantheism]], levelled at him by [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] in ''Über Sprache und Weisheit der Indier'' (1808).&lt;ref&gt;Mayer p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[Pantheism controversy]] of the 1780s continued to cast a long shadow. [[F. H. Jacobi]], who had launched it, was someone with whom Schelling was in contact in [[Munich]], where the book was written.

In his book, Schelling takes up the issue of pantheism, concerned to refute the idea that it necessarily leads to [[fatalism]], so negating human freedom. Here he is closer to Spinoza, erasing the distinction between nature and God. On the other hand, Schelling is trying to overcome the distinction made in Spinoza's system, between ''[[natura naturans]]'' (dynamic) and ''[[natura naturata]]'' (passive). Schelling wanted to locate the fatalism in Spinoza, not in the pantheism or monism, but in his formulation.&lt;ref name = Hedley&gt;Douglas Hedley, ''Coleridge, philosophy and religion: Aids to reflection and the mirror of the spirit'' (2000), pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthesis claimed===

According to Andrew Bowie:

{{cquote|The central issue in ''FS'' is ... a non-reductionist account of the relationship of thinking to being. Spinoza's system ... is seen as 'one-sidedly realistic' (in the sense of 'materialist'), and as in need of completion by an 'ideal' aspect in which 'freedom reigns'.&lt;ref&gt;Bowie, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schelling considered that the idealist conception of freedom, in [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], had remained undeveloped, absent a cleaner break with the rationalist systems of Spinoza and [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and a distinctive theory of its human element.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Francois Courtine]], ''Schelling'', p. 86-87 in Simon Critchley, William Ralph Schroeder (editors), ''A Companion to Continental Philosophy'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; In another view of the book's main theme, leading onto the further development of the philosophy of the ''[[Weltalter]]'' (Ages of the World), Schelling

{{cquote|...sought to grasp the dynamic differentiation in God and hence the temporal quality of the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Dallmayr, ''Heidegger on Ethics and Justice'', p. 194 in Arleen B. Dallery, Stephen H. Watson, E. Marya Bower (editors), ''Transitions in Continental Philosophy'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this approach, the Absolute takes on a darker side, and shows therefore the connection to the theme of the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Günther Zöller, ''German realism: the self-limitation of idealist thinking in Fichte, Schelling and Schopenhauer'', p. 209, in [[Karl Ameriks]] (editor), ''The Cambridge Companion to German Idealism'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect then pervades all life:

{{cquote|The duality of (blind) nature and (enlightened) existence is not limited to God's original self-construction. It is said to permeate all of creation, which thus repeats on a finite scale the divine process of self-realization from will to reason. In finite individuals the dark, blind will manifests itself as particular will as stands in opposition to the enlightened or universal will.&lt;ref&gt;Zöller in ''Cambridge Companion'', p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Summary==

This is an approximate summary of the content of the ''Freiheitsschrift'' using page numbering as appears in Schelling's ''Works''.&lt;ref&gt;These numbers are shown in the Gutmann translation in the margin, and a German text in the original numbering is available as a [http://www.dalank.de/archiv/freiheit.pdf PDF].&lt;/ref&gt; There is no division except into paragraphs.

*336-8 There is a traditional view that system excludes individual freedom; but on the contrary it does have "a place in the universe". This is a problem to solve.
*338-343 Reformulation as the issue of pantheism and fatalism.
*343-8 Spinoza and Leibniz.
*348 German idealism versus French atheistic mechanism; Fichte's ''Wissenschaftslehre''.
*349-352 It is a mistake to believe that idealism has simply displaced pantheism.
*352-355 The real conception of freedom is the possibility of good and evil.
*356-357 Critique of the abstract conception of God; ''Naturphilosophie''.
*357-358 Ground of God and light.
*359-366 Critique of immanence.
*366-373 Conception of evil according to Baader.
*373-376 Evil is necessary for God's revelation; exegesis of "matter" in Plato.
*376-7 The irrational element in organic beings; disjunction of light and darkness.
*379 Golden Age.
*382-3 Formal conception of freedom; Buridan's Ass.
*383 Idealism defines freedom.

*389-394 General possibility of evil and inversion of selfhood's place.
*394 God's freedom.
*396 Leibniz on laws of nature.
*399 God is not a system, but a life; finite life in man.
*402 God brought forward order from chaos.
*403 History is incomprehensible without a concept of a humanly suffering God.
*406 Primal ground (''Ungrund'') is before all antitheses; groundlessness self-divides.
*409 Evil is a parody.
*412 Revelation and reason.
*413 Paganism and Christianity.
*413 Personality rests on a dark foundation, which is also the foundation of knowledge.
*414 Dialectical philosophy.

*416 Nature as revelation, and its archetypes. Promise of further treatises.

==A debated transition==

Schelling placed the ''Freiheitsschrift'' at the end of the first volume of his ''Sämmtliche Werke'' (Collected Works). The correct periodisation of his philosophy is still a contentious area, and there are differing views of what kind of punctuation mark it really represents in Schelling's work. It is admittedly important that the book itself begins with an outright rejection of “system”.&lt;ref&gt;David Walsh, ''The Modern Philosophical Revolution: The Luminosity of Existence'' (2008), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of this book is said, on the one hand, to mark the beginning of Schelling's “middle period”.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schelling/#3&lt;/ref&gt; As such it marks the break with the “identity philosophy” on which he worked in the first decade of the nineteenth century, after his beginnings as a follower of [[Johann Fichte]] and developer of ''[[Naturphilosophie]]''.

The divergence of Schelling and Hegel becomes clear from around this year, with Hegel's ambitions being systematic and explicitly encyclopedic, notions of freedom being quite different, and the use of dialectic becoming obviously distinct on the two sides. Hegel's star was in the ascendent, while Schelling's other road led into the wilderness, at least as far as academic respectability was concerned. Academic recognition for Schelling's work as important to philosophy, as opposed to an idiosyncratic contribution to [[philosophy of religion]], was indeed slow to come. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], one of Schelling's contemporaries and followers, rated it highly.&lt;ref name = Hedley/&gt;

In 1936, [[Martin Heidegger]] gave a series of lectures on Schelling's freedom essay. These were published in German in 1971 and translated into English in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;M. Heidegger, ''Schellings Abhandlung über das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit'', Tubingen, Max Niemeyer Verlag, 1971 

Translation by Joan Stambaugh as ''Schelling's Treatise on the Essence of Human Freedom'', Athens, Ohio University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger largely treated the ''Freiheitschrift'' as continuous with the "identity philosophy" period leading up to it.&lt;ref&gt;Kyriaki Goudeli, ''Challenges to German Idealism: Schelling, Fichte and Kant'' (2002), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger by 1941 had hardened his line to the position that Schelling is still a theorist of an enclosing [[subjectivity]], while treating the ''Freiheitsschrift'' as the apex (''Gipfel'') of the metaphysics of German idealism. This view is still contested: other authors read the book as the start of something new in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Bowie p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Schelling's ''Stuttgart Vorlesungen'' of 1810 reformulate and build on the freedom essay, and the ''Weltalter'' manuscripts go further in trying to work out details of the Behmenist insights.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate is therefore really whether the ''Freiheitschrift'' is culminating, seminal, or possibly both.

In philosophy and rhetoric, the '''principle of humanity''' states that when interpreting another speaker we must assume that his or her beliefs and desires are connected to each other and to reality in some way, and attribute to him or her "the propositional attitudes one supposes one would have oneself in those circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Dennett]], "Mid-Term Examination," in The Intentional Stance, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of humanity was named by [[Richard Grandy]] (then an assistant professor of philosophy at [[Princeton University]]) who first expressed it in 1973.

In [[mathematics]], a '''quasitoric manifold''' is a topological analogue of the [[Toric variety#Resolution of Singularities|nonsingular]] projective [[toric variety]] of [[algebraic geometry]]. A [[Smooth manifold|smooth]] &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[manifold]] is a quasitoric manifold if it admits a smooth, locally standard action of an [[Torus#n-dimensional torus|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional torus]], with [[orbit space]] an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Simple polytope|simple]] [[Convex polytope|convex]] [[polytope]].

Quasitoric manifolds were introduced in 1991 by M. Davis and T. Januszkiewicz,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;M. Davis and T. Januskiewicz, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; who called them "toric manifolds". However, the term "quasitoric manifold" was eventually adopted to avoid confusion with the class of compact smooth [[toric variety|toric varieties]], which are known to algebraic geometers as [[toric manifold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;V. Buchstaber and T. Panov, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quasitoric manifolds are studied in a variety of contexts in [[algebraic topology]], such as [[Complex cobordism|complex cobordism theory]], and the other oriented [[Cohomology theory|cohomology theories]].&lt;ref&gt;V. Buchstaber and N. Ray, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Denote the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th subcircle of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-torus &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;T_1 \times \ldots \times T_n = T^n&lt;/math&gt;. Then coordinate-wise multiplication of &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''standard representation'''.

Given open sets &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;, that are closed under the [[Group action|action]] of &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt;, a &lt;math&gt;T^{n}&lt;/math&gt;-action on &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be '''locally isomorphic''' to the standard representation if &lt;math&gt;h(tx) = \alpha(t)h(x)&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is a [[homeomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is an [[automorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a simple convex polytope &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; [[Facet (mathematics)|facets]], a &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt;-manifold &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; is a '''quasitoric manifold over''' &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt; if,

# the &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt;-action is locally isomorphic to the standard representation,
# there is a [[projection map|projection]] &lt;math&gt;\pi : M^{2n} \rightarrow P^n&lt;/math&gt; that maps each &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional orbit to a point in the interior of an &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Face (geometry)|face]] of &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;l = 0,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;...,&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

The definition implies that the fixed points of &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; under the &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt;-action are mapped to the vertices of &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, while points where the action is free project to the interior of the polytope.

==The dicharacteristic function==
A quasitoric manifold can be described in terms of a '''dicharacteristic function''' and an associated '''dicharacteristic matrix'''. In this setting it is useful to assume that the facets &lt;math&gt;F_1,\dots,F_m&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt; are ordered so that the intersection &lt;math&gt;F_{1} \cap  \dots  \cap F_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''initial vertex'''.

A '''dicharacteristic function''' is a [[homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda : T^m \rightarrow T^n&lt;/math&gt;, such that if &lt;math&gt;F_{i_1} \cap  \dots  \cap F_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[codimension]]-&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; face of &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a [[monomorphism]] on restriction to the subtorus &lt;math&gt;T_{i_1} \times  \dots  \times T_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;T^m&lt;/math&gt;.

The restriction of &amp;lambda; to the subtorus &lt;math&gt;T_1 \times \ldots \times T_n&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the initial vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism, and so &lt;math&gt;\lambda(T_1), \ldots, \lambda(T_n)&lt;/math&gt; can be taken to be a basis for the [[Lie algebra]] of &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt;. The [[epimorphism]] of Lie algebras associated to &amp;lambda; may be described as a linear transformation &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^n&lt;/math&gt;, represented by the &lt;math&gt; n \times m&lt;/math&gt; '''dicharacteristic matrix''' &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; given by

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_{1, n+1} &amp; \dots &amp; \lambda_{1, m}\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_{2, n+1} &amp; \dots &amp; \lambda_{2, m}\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; 1 &amp; \lambda_{n, n+1} &amp; \dots &amp; \lambda_{n, m}
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th column of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a primitive vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i = (\lambda_{1, i}, \dots, \lambda_{n, i})&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^n&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''facet vector'''.  As each facet vector is primitive, whenever the facets &lt;math&gt;F_{i_1} \cap  \dots  \cap F_{i_n}&lt;/math&gt; meet in a vertex, the corresponding columns &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{i_1}, \dots \lambda_{i_n}&lt;/math&gt; form a basis of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^n&lt;/math&gt;, with determinant equal to &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[Isotropy group#Orbits and stabilizers|isotropy subgroup]] associated to each facet &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; is described by

::&lt;math&gt; \{(e^{2\pi i \theta\lambda_{1,i}}, \ldots, e^{2\pi i \theta\lambda_{n,i}}) \in T^n \},  &lt;/math&gt;

for some &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

In their original treatment of quasitoric manifolds, Davis and Januskiewicz&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; introduced the notion of a '''characteristic function''' that mapped each facet of the polytope to a vector determining the isotropy subgroup of the facet, but this is only defined up to sign.  In more recent studies of quasitoric manifolds, this ambiguity has been removed by the introduction of the dicharacteristic function and its insistence that each circle &lt;math&gt;\lambda(T_i)&lt;/math&gt; be oriented, forcing a choice of sign for each vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;. The notion of the dicharacteristic function was originally introduced V. Buchstaber and N. Ray&lt;ref&gt;V. Buchstaber and N. Ray, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; to enable the study of quasitoric manifolds in complex cobordism theory.  This was further refined by introducing the ordering of the facets of the polytope to define the initial vertex, which eventually leads to the above neat representation of the dicharacteristic matrix &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;(I_n \mid S)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity matrix]] and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n \times (m-n)&lt;/math&gt; submatrix.&lt;ref&gt;V. Buchstaber, T. Panov and N. Ray, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to the moment-angle complex==
The kernel &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; of the dicharacteristic function acts freely on the [[moment angle complex]] &lt;math&gt;Z_{P^n}&lt;/math&gt;, and so defines a [[Principle fiber bundle|principal]] &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;-bundle &lt;math&gt;Z_{P^n} \rightarrow M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; over the resulting [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;.  This quotient space can be viewed as

:: &lt;math&gt;T^n \times P^n / \sim, &lt;/math&gt;

where pairs &lt;math&gt;(t_1, p_1)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(t_2, p_2)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;T^n \times P^n&lt;/math&gt; are identified if and only if &lt;math&gt;p_1 = p_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_1^{-1}t_2&lt;/math&gt; is in the image of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; on restriction to the subtorus &lt;math&gt;T_{i_1} \times \dots \times T_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; that corresponds to the unique face &lt;math&gt;F_{i_1} \cap \dots \cap F_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt; containing the point &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt;, for some &lt;math&gt;1 \leq k \leq n&lt;/math&gt;.

It can be shown that any quasitoric manifold &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt; is [[Equivariant map|equivariently]] [[Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to a quasitoric manifold of the form of the quotient space above.&lt;ref&gt;M. Davis and T. Januskiewicz, 1991, Proposition 1.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* The &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[complex projective space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}P^n&lt;/math&gt; is a quasitoric manifold over the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-[[simplex]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n&lt;/math&gt; is embedded in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; so that the origin is the initial vertex, a dicharacteristic function can be chosen so that the associated dicharacteristic matrix is

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 &amp; -1\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 &amp; -1\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; 1 &amp; -1
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The moment angle complex &lt;math&gt;Z_{\Delta^n}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;(2n+1)&lt;/math&gt;-sphere &lt;math&gt;S^{2n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, the kernel &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is the diagonal subgroup &lt;math&gt;\{(t, \dots, t)\} &lt; T^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, so the quotient of &lt;math&gt;Z_{\Delta^n}&lt;/math&gt; under the action of &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}P^n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;V. Buchstaber, T. Panov and N. Ray, 2007, Example 3.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Bott manifold]]s that form the stages in a [[Bott tower]] are quasitoric manifolds over [[Hypercube|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-cubes]]. The &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-cube &lt;math&gt;I^n&lt;/math&gt; is embedded in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; so that the origin is the initial vertex, and a dicharacteristic function is chosen so that the associated dicharacteristic matrix &lt;math&gt;(I_n \mid S)&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; given by

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1       &amp;0          &amp;\cdots &amp;0      &amp;0      &amp;\cdots &amp;0  &amp;0  \\
-a(1,2)   &amp;1          &amp;\cdots &amp;0      &amp;0      &amp;\cdots &amp;0  &amp;0  \\
\vdots      &amp;\vdots         &amp;   &amp;\vdots     &amp;\vdots     &amp;   &amp;\vdots &amp;\vdots \\
-a(1,i)   &amp;-a(2,i)      &amp;\cdots &amp;-a(i-1,i)    &amp;1      &amp;\cdots &amp;0  &amp;0  \\
\vdots      &amp;\vdots         &amp;   &amp;\vdots     &amp;\vdots     &amp;   &amp;\vdots &amp;\vdots \\
-a(1,n) &amp;-a(2,n)        &amp;\cdots &amp;-a(i-1,n)  &amp;-a(i,n)    &amp;\cdots &amp;-a(n-1,n)  &amp;1  
\end{bmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

for integers &lt;math&gt;a(i,j)&lt;/math&gt;.

The moment angle complex &lt;math&gt;Z_{I^n}&lt;/math&gt; is a product of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; copies of 3-sphere embedded in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, the kernel &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is given by

::&lt;math&gt;\{(t_1,t_1^{-a(1,2)}t_2,\dots,t_1^{-a(1,i)}\dots t_{i-1}^{-a(i-1,i)}t_i,\dots, t_1^{-a(1,n)}\dots t_{n-1}^{-a(n-1,n)}t_n, t_1^{-1}, \dots, t_n^{-1}) : t_i \in T,  1\leq i\leq n \} &lt; T^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;,

so that the quotient of &lt;math&gt;Z_{I^n}&lt;/math&gt; under the action of &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th stage of a Bott tower.&lt;ref&gt;V. Buchstaber, T. Panov and N. Ray, 2007, Example 3.12.&lt;/ref&gt; The integer values &lt;math&gt;a(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; are the tensor powers of the line bundles whose product is used in the iterated sphere-bundle construction of the Bott tower.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Civan and N. Ray, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The cohomology ring of a quasitoric manifold==
Canonical [[complex line bundle]]s &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; given by

:: &lt;math&gt;Z_{P^n} \times_{K(l)} \mathbb{C}_i \longrightarrow M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;,

can be associated with each facet &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; acts on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_i&lt;/math&gt;, by the restriction of &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; to the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th subcircle of &lt;math&gt;T^m&lt;/math&gt; embedded in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.  These bundles are known as the '''facial bundles''' associated to the quasitoric manifold.  By the definition of &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, the preimage of a facet &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1}(F_i)&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;2(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional quasitoric '''facial submanifold''' &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt;, whose isotropy subgroup is the restriction of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; on the subcircle &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;T^m&lt;/math&gt;.  Restriction of &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; gives the [[Normal bundle|normal]] 2-plane bundle of the embedding of &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;H^2(M^{2n}; \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; denote the first [[Chern class]] of &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt;. The integral [[cohomology ring]] &lt;math&gt;H^*(M^{2n}; \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; is generated by &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq m&lt;/math&gt;, subject to two sets of relations. The first are the relations generated by the [[Stanley–Reisner ring|Stanley–Reisner ideal]] of &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt;; linear relations determined by the dicharacterstic function comprise the second set:

:: &lt;math&gt;x_i = -\lambda_{i, n+1}x_{n+1} - \cdots - \lambda_{i, m}x_m,  \mbox{ for } 1\leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore only &lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}, \dots, x_m&lt;/math&gt; are required to generate &lt;math&gt;H^*(M^{2n}; \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; multiplicatively.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Comparison with toric manifolds==
* Any projective toric manifold is a quasitoric manifold, and in some cases non-projective toric manifolds are also quasitoric manifolds.
* Not all quasitoric manifolds are toric manifolds. For example, the [[connected sum]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}P^2 \sharp \mathbb{C}P^2&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed as a quasitoric manifold, but it is not a toric manifold.&lt;ref&gt;M. Masuda and D. Y. Suh 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5323">'''Schizoanalysis''' ({{lang-fr|schizanalyse}}; ''schizo-'' from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] σχίζειν ''skhizein'', meaning "to split") is a concept created by philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] and psychoanalyst [[Félix Guattari]] and first expounded in their book ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972). Its formulation was continued in their follow-up work, ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]''. Schizoanalysis acquires many different definitions during the course of its development in their collaborative work and individually in the work of Guattari.

In ''Chaosmosis'', Guattari explains that "rather than moving in the direction of [[reductionism|reductionist]] modifications which simplify the complex", schizoanalysis "will work towards its complexification, its processual enrichment, towards the consistency of its virtual lines of bifurcation and [[differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]], in short towards its ontological [[heterogeneity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Guattari (1992, 61).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of the idea==
Schizoanalysis was developed over a long period of time as a response to the perceived shortcomings in the basic premises of psychoanalytic practice. Guattari was directly confronted with such problems in the work of [[Sigmund Freud]]—namely, the use of the [[Oedipus complex]] as a starting point for the analysis, and the authoritarian role of the psychoanalyst in relationship to the patient. Guattari was interested in a practice that could derive from given systems of enunciation and preexisting subjective structures new "assemblages [''agencements''] of enunciation" capable of forging new coordinates of analysis and to bring into existence unforeseen propositions and representations.

By the time of "Five Propositions on Psychoanalysis" (1973),&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze, Desert Islands and Other Texts, 1953–1974, MIT Press, 2004 (pp. 274--280), originally published in "Relazione di Gilles Deleuze" and discussions in Armando Verdiglione, ed., ''Psicanalisi e Politica; Atti del Convegno di studi tenuto a Milano l'8—9 Maggio 1973''. Milan: Feltrinelli, 1973, pp. 7-11, 17-21, 37-40, 44-45, 169-172. Abridged and edited&lt;/ref&gt; Deleuze said "we no longer want to talk about schizoanalysis, because that would amount to protecting a particular type of escape, schizophrenic escape".

==Components==
Schizoanalysis can be represented by four circular components that bud and form [[rhizome (metaphor)|rhizomes]]:&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari (1980, 160-2).&lt;/ref&gt;

# The generative component: the study of concrete mixed [[semiotics]]; their mixtures and variations. Making a tracing of the mixed semiotics.
# The transformational component: the study of pure semiotics; their transformations-translations and the creation of new semiotics. Making the transformational map of the regimes, with their possibilities for translation and creation, for budding along the lines of the tracings.
# The diagrammatic component: the study of abstract machines, from the standpoint of semiotically unformed matters in relation to physically unformed matters. Making the diagram of the abstract machines that are in play in each case, either as potentialities or as effective [[emergence]]s.
# The machinic component: the study of the assemblages that effectuate abstract machines, simultaneously semiotizing matters of expression and physicalizing matters of content. Outlining the program of the assemblages that distribute everything and bring a circulation of movement with alternatives, jumps, and mutations.

Schizoanalysis also proposes a novel take on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari, [[Anti-Oedipus]] (1972, 351-352 and 381), &lt;/ref&gt; inasmuch as it concerns an analysis of the "''n'' sexes" of a subject.

'''Slashing''' is a crime intended to cause bodily harm to a victim. A slashing is typically performed with a [[knife]] or other type of bladed or sharp object.

==Slashing of the throat==
Cutting of the throat as to render the victim unable to [[breathing|breathe]].

==Slashing of the face==
A street crime where a perpetrator permanently disfigures a victim by slicing into their face with a blade.

Boxer [[Teddy Atlas]] was involved in a street fight in [[Stapleton, Staten Island]] in which his face was severely slashed with a "007" flip-knife. The wound took 400 stitches in total to close, with 200 on the outside of his face and 200 on the inside. He is left with a scar that stretches from top to bottom along his left cheek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dratlasfoundation.com/aboutus_bio_teddyatlas.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917050810/http://dratlasfoundation.com/aboutus_bio_teddyatlas.html |archivedate=2011-09-17 |df= }} Teddy Atlas Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

Actress and comedian [[Tina Fey]] has a scar a few inches long on the left side of her chin and cheek, the cause of which remained unexplained to the public until a 2008 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' profile by [[Maureen Dowd]]. Dowd reported "...a faint scar runs across Tina Fey's left cheek, the result of a violent cutting attack by a stranger when Fey was five..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|title=What Tina Wants|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2009/01/tina_fey200901|work=VanityFair.com|publisher=Vanity Fair (Condé Nast Publications)|accessdate=January 12, 2012|date=January 2009|quote=... a faint scar runs across Tina Fey's left cheek, the result of a violent cutting attack by a stranger when Fey was five.

When my face was slashed, my dad held me on his lap in the car to the hospital, applying direct pressure with the swift calm of a veteran and an ex-fireman. I looked up and asked him, ‘Am I going to die?’ ‘Don’t speak,’ he said."&lt;ref&gt;''Bossypants''&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]] was the victim of a slashing when he was mugged outside of a club he was working at in Scotland. The slashing on both of his cheeks left him with what is known as a "[[Glasgow smile]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fuckyeahtommyflanagan.tumblr.com/post/10498778098/seraphina01-fuckyeahtommyflanagan | title=Tommy Flanagan - Where the Ride Takes You | author=Alex Simon | date=February 2001 | accessdate=10 June 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429101839/http://fuckyeahtommyflanagan.tumblr.com/post/10498778098/seraphina01-fuckyeahtommyflanagan | archivedate=29 April 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://glaswegiansmiler.tumblr.com/post/14722738285/film-review-january-2000-the-brit-at-the-back | title=The Brit at the Back | work=Film Review | date=January 2000 | accessdate=10 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Booth|first=Samantha|title=Scots actor Tommy Flanagan rocks on in Hollywood as biker gang drama takes off|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-interviews/2010/03/21/scots-actor-tommy-flanagan-rocks-on-in-hollywood-as-biker-gang-drama-takes-off-86908-22127632/|newspaper=Sunday Mail (UK)|date=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lead missing|date=February 2018}}'''Societal security''' is a concept developed by the  [[Copenhagen School (international relations)|Copenhagen School]] of security studies that refers to 'the ability of a society to persist in its essential character under changing conditions and possible or actual threats'.&lt;ref&gt;Waever, Ole, (1993) Identity, Migration and the New Security Agenda in Europe p23&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the [[Cold War]] prompted scholars to rethink the paradigm of [[security]] independently from the state and the military.&lt;ref&gt;(Bilgin 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the [[Collapse of the soviet union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] led to the emergence of new states and sustained efforts to pursue the [[European Union]] (EU) integration. The new order called for a (re)conceptualisation of Europe and European security, which challenged classic understandings of security, as something that took place between states. The move towards an EU security was, thus, closely articulated around questions of EU identity, free movement of people and borders. 
The concept of societal security, developed by scholars associated with the [[Copenhagen Peace Research Institute]], is situated within this context.&lt;ref&gt;(Bilgin 2003, 211)&lt;/ref&gt; Societal security relates to: "the ability of a society to persist in its essential character under changing conditions and possible or actual threats."&lt;ref&gt;(Wæver, Buzan, et al. 1993, 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 'Identity, Migration, and the New Security Agenda in Europe', Wæver notes the emergence of different conceptions of the [[nation state|nation-state]], and further establishes a distinction between [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. In the West, a “decoupling of state and nation” takes place, as [[member state of the European Union|member states]], by seeking more integration, accept to relinquish some of their [[sovereignty]]. This move towards a “post-sovereign” nation-state is due to “internationalisation and Europeanization” processes, as international institutions assume increased influence over domestic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;(Wæver 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, communities, perceiving their identities to be threatened by this integration, can no longer call upon the state to protect them. A duality occurs between the security needs of the state and of society, where “state security has sovereignty as its ultimate criterion, and societal security has identity”.&lt;ref&gt;(Wæver 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; In the East, the emergence of new states, formed after the dismantlement of the [[Soviet Union]], leads to more traditional attempts at merging the nation and the state; thus, conflicts arise when the coupling cannot be done (i.e. [[Yugoslavia]]).&lt;ref&gt;(Wæver 1996, 114)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 'Security: a new framework for analysis', Buzan et al. formalise their broader understanding of security by introducing five sectors, each governed by “distinctive characteristics and dynamics”, and conceptualised around particular referent objects and actors (i.e. military, environmental, economic, societal and political). Societal security is about the survival of a community as a cohesive unit; its referent object is ”large scale collective identities that can function independent of the state.”&lt;ref&gt;(Buzan, Wæver et de Wilde 1998, 22)&lt;/ref&gt;
Societal insecurities arise when “a society fears it would not be able to live as itself”, and stem from:
* [[Immigration|migration]]: the influx of people will “overrun or dilute” a [[Group identity|group’s identity]] e.g. the need to define Britishness; 
* vertical competition: the integration of a group within a broader organisation e.g. [[euroscepticism]] with regards to EU integration, national-separatist claims; and, 
* horizontal competition: group is forced to integrate more influential identities within their own e.g. France’s cultural exception defending itself against American influences.&lt;ref&gt;(Buzan, Wæver et de Wilde 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Societal security is not tied to a territory, as is state security, e.g. [[Kurds]], where security matters of state and society widely diverge and enter into conflict.&lt;ref&gt;(Buzan, Wæver et de Wilde 1998, 119)&lt;/ref&gt;

Societal security in sociological viewpoint is:

Regarding security as an "independent phenomenon":

So, societal security isn't threat, no opportunity. But it is a center and base, upon it the reliability and certainty of collective life could be gained.

Rereading of security from "social" perspective:

It means that security is based on collective life, the life of common people, instead of looking at differences and insisting on disagreement between groups and states that is key factor in determining threats and distinguish friend and foe.

Viewing security as "social phenomenon":

Hence, societal security doesn't need military weapons and soft power solutions. In other words, societal security doesn't integrate with power and remain by converting links to social capitals.

Finally, threats and opportunities could be considered as deterrent or impeller factors.

So the final goal of societal security is comfort and understanding the beauty of collective life – not an interest for government, not eliminating enemies, not confronting a threat for nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Societal Security |last=Navidnia |first=Manijeh |publisher=Research Institute of Strategic Studies (Rahbordi) |year=2009 |isbn=978-600-5282-12-2 |location=Iran, Tehran |pages=69–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What does securitization do? ==

A community, acting upon these insecurities, will try to present an issue as being an [[existential threat]] endangering the survival of a group. Thus, [[Securitization (international relations)|securitization]] is a tactic that seeks to categorise an issue as an existential threat, for its prioritisation over any other issue (i.e. “absolute priority”). Addressing any other issue would be pointless, if the existential threat is not addressed first. Thereby, securitization justifies and legitimises the use of exceptional measures.

{{quote|“’Security’ is the move that takes politics beyond the established rules of the game and frames the issue either as a special kind of politics or as above politics. Securitization can thus be seen as a more extreme version of politicization.”&lt;ref&gt;(Buzan, Wæver et de Wilde 1998, 23)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|“…when a securitizing actor uses a rhetoric of existential threat and thereby takes an issue out of what under those conditions is “normal politics,” we have a case of securitization.”&lt;ref&gt;(Buzan, Wæver et de Wilde 1998, 24-25)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Making use of language theory, securitization is conceptualised as a speech-act, and as such, relies on linguistic techniques and audiences. The message has to be properly delivered (e.g. using appropriate vocabulary, framing, diffusion channels, etc.) for an audience to accept it. 

{{quote|“Thus, the exact definition and criteria of securitization is constituted by the intersubjective establishment of an existential threat with a saliency sufficient to have substantial political effects.”&lt;ref&gt;(Buzan, Wæver et de Wilde 1998, 25)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Not all [[Speech act|speech-act]] are successful. They have to be uttered by those holding enough social capital to be heard and taken seriously. Successful societal security speech-acts can only be uttered by the elites of specific communities. Because of their existential nature, only few claims can be successfully securitised.

==Criticism==
The concept of societal security developed by the Copenhagen School has been subject to several academic criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;Arcudi, G. (2006), La sécurité entre permanence et changement, ''Relations Internationales'', 125: 97-109&lt;/ref&gt; Theiler argues that when discussing societal security there is a tendency to reify societies as independent social agents. Theiler also states that a too vague definition of identity is deployed when discussing the concept and there is a failure to 'demonstrate sufficiently that social security matters to individuals'.&lt;ref&gt;Theiler, T. (2003),  Societal security and social psychology, ''Review of International Studies'', 29: 249-268&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, understanding exceptional measures as extremely politicised responses and/or measures outside politics is problematic, as it implies different frames of action within a large scale of possible. What constitutes “normal politics”? Are these measures outside or within the frame of the law? Do they apply to everyone or only to a specific group? Do they hold policy implication? These questions are particularly relevant to appreciate the types of security measures a securitization through societal security could bring, i.e. what could a community do by securitising identities? Hence, this vagueness could indicate a decision not to engage with debates around exceptional measures or the limits of conceptualising the modus operandi of security measures outside of the state.

'''Svabhava''' ({{lang-sa|svabhāva}}; {{lang-pi|sabhāva}}; {{zh|c=自性|p=zìxìng}}; {{bo|t=རང་བཞིན|w=rang-bzhin}})&lt;ref&gt;Dharma Dictionary (2008). rang bzhin. Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/rang_bzhin] (accessed: January 29, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; literally means "own-being" or "own-becoming". It is the intrinsic nature, essential nature or essence of living beings.

The concept and term ''svabhāva'' are frequently encountered in Hindu and Buddhist traditions such as [[Advaita Vedanta]] (e.g. in the ''[[Avadhuta Gita|Avadhūta Gītā]]''), [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] (e.g. in the ''[[Ratnagotravibhāga]]''), [[Vaishnavism]] (e.g., the writings of [[Ramanuja]]) and [[Dzogchen]] (e.g. in the [[seventeen tantras]]).

In the nondual Advaita Vedānta yoga text, ''Avadhūta Gītā'', [[Brahman]] (in the Upanishadic denotation) is the ''sabhāva''.

In the Mahāyāna Buddhadharma tradition(s) it is one of a suite of terms employed to denote the [[Buddha-nature]], such as "''[[gotra]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Ruegg, D. Seyfort (1976). 'The Meanings of the Term "Gotra" and the Textual History of the "Ratnagotravibhāga"'. Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 39, No. 2 (1976), pp. 341–363&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian philosophy==
The term first appears in the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], as a possible first cause (''jagatkāraṇa'').&lt;ref&gt;Ramkrishna Bhattacharya, ''Svabhāvavada'' and the Cārvāka/Lokāyata: A Historical Overview&lt;/ref&gt; There also seems to have been an Indian philosophical position called ''Svabhāvavada'' which was akin to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] which held that "things are as their nature makes them".&lt;ref&gt;M. Hiriyanna, Outlines of Indian Philosophy, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible this position was similar to or associated with [[Charvaka|Carvaka]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramkrishna Bhattacharya, ''Svabhāvavada'' and the Cārvāka/Lokāyata: A Historical Overview&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samkhya===
In early [[Samkhya]] philosophy, Svabhava was a term which was associated with [[Prakṛti]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerald James Larson, Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; It is the inherent capacity of [[Prakṛti]], which is independent and self caused.&lt;ref&gt;Knut A. Jacobsen, Prakr̥ti in Samkhya-yoga: Material Principle, Religious Experience, Ethical Implications, 1999, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Vaishnavism===
The ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad Gītā]]'' (18.41) has nature (''svabhava'') as a distinguishing quality differentiating the ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varṇā]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{cite web |url=http://vedabase.net/bg/18/41/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616084818/http://vedabase.net/bg/18/41/ |archivedate=2010-06-16 |df= }} (accessed: Tuesday April 6, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Overzee (1992: p.&amp;nbsp;74) in her work on [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881–1955) and [[Ramanuja|Rāmānuja]] (1017–1137) highlights Rāmānuja's usage of ''svabhāva'' in relation to Brahman thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let us look more closely at what Rāmānuja means by the Lord's "nature". If you read his writings, you will find that he uses two distinct yet related words when referring to the nature of Brahman: ''svarūpa'' and ''svabhāva''.&lt;ref&gt;Overzee, Anne Hunt (1992).

==Buddhism==
In early [[Theravada|Theravādin]] texts, the term "''svabhāva''" did not carry the technical meaning or the soteriological weight of later writings. Much of Mahayana Buddhism (as in the ''[[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]'') denies that such a ''svabhāva'' exists within any being; however, in the [[tathāgatagarbha sūtras]], notably the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'', the Buddha states that the immortal and infinite Buddha-nature - or "true self" of the Buddha - is the indestructible ''svabhāva'' of beings.

===Theravāda===
In the [[Pāli Canon]], ''sabhāva'' is absent from what are generally considered to be the earliest texts. When found in later texts (e.g., the [[paracanonical texts (Theravada Buddhism)|paracanonical]] ''[[Milinda Panha|Milindapañha]])'', it generically refers to state (of mind), character or truth.

In the post-canonical [[abhidharma|Abhidhamma]] literature, ''sabhāva'' is used to distinguish an irreducible, [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent]], momentary [[dharma|phenomenon]] (''dhamma'') from a conventionally constructed object.  Thus, a collection of visual and tactile phenomena might be mentally constructed into what is conventionally referred to as a "table"; but, beyond its constituent elements, a construct such as "table" lacks intrinsic existence  (''sabhāva'').

According to Peter Harvey, svabhava in the Theravada Abhidhamma is something conditional and interdependent:
{{quote|"They are dhammas because they uphold their own nature [sabhaava]. They are dhammas because they are upheld by conditions or they are upheld according to their own nature" (Asl.39). Here 'own-nature' would mean characteristic nature, which is not something inherent in a dhamma as a separate ultimate reality, but arise due to the supporting conditions both of other dhammas and previous occurrences of that dhamma. This is of significance as it makes the Mahayana critique of the Sarvastivadin's notion of own-nature largely irrelevant to the Theravada.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter; INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHISM, page 97&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Vaibhāṣika ===
The [[Sarvastivada|Vaibhāṣika]] school held that dharmas have a constant [[essence]] or inherent nature (''svabhāva'') which persists through past, present and future.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Westerhoff, The Golden Age of Indian Buddhist Philosophy in the First Millennium CE, 2018, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also identified as a unique mark or own characteristic (''svalaksana'') that differentiated a dharma and remained unchangeable throughout its existence. According to Vaibhāṣikas, ''svabhavas'' are those things that exist substantially (''dravyasat'') as opposed to those things which are made up of aggregations of dharmas and thus only have a nominal existence (''prajñaptisat'').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

===Madhyamaka===
Robinson (1957: p.&amp;nbsp;300) in discussing the [[Buddhist logic]] of [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]], states:
{{quote|''Svabhāva'' is by definition the subject of contradictory ascriptions. If it exists, it must belong to an existent entity, which means that it must be conditioned, dependent on other entities, and possessed of causes. But a ''svabhāva'' is by definition unconditioned, not dependent on other entities, and not caused. Thus the existence of a ''svabhāva'' is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Richard H. (1957). Some Logical Aspects of Nagarjuna's System. ''Philosophy East &amp; West''. Volume 6, no. 4 (October 1957). University of Hawaii Press. Source: {{cite web |url=http://www.orientalia.org/printout470.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041127175124/http://www.orientalia.org/printout470.html |archivedate=2004-11-27 |df= }} (accessed: Saturday March 21, 2009), p.300&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Dzogchen===
Dzogchen upholds a view of ''niḥsvabhāva'', refuting ''svabhāva'' using the same logic employed by Madhyamaka, a freedom from extremes demonstrated succinctly via [[Catuṣkoṭi]] [[Tetralemma]]. 
{{quote|As it ([[rigpa]]) transcends awareness and non-awareness, there are not even the imputations of awareness. This is called the Dzogpa Chenpo, free from extremes.&lt;ref&gt;Thondup Rinpoche, Tulku (1989). ''The Practice Of Dzogchen''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion. {{ISBN|1-55939-054-9}}, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the context of logical analysis, Dzogchen agrees with the view of [[Madhyamaka]] as elucidated by [[Nāgārjuna]], Chögyal [[Namkhai Norbu]] explains:

{{quote|...Madhyamaka explains with the four "beyond concepts," which are that something neither exists, nor does not exist, nor both exists and does not exist, nor is beyond both existing and not existing together. These are the four possibilities. What remains? Nothing. Although we are working only in an intellectual way, this can be considered the ultimate conclusion in Madhyamaka.

====Bonpo Dzogchen====
''Svabhāva'' is very important in the [[nontheistic]] [[theology]] of the [[Bonpo]] Great Perfection (Dzogchen) tradition where it is part of a technical language to render macrocosm and microcosm into [[nonduality]], as Rossi (1999: p.&amp;nbsp;58) states:
{{quote|The View of the Great Perfection further acknowledges the ontological identity of the macrocosmic and microcosmic realities through the threefold axiom of Condition (ngang), Ultimate Nature (rang bzhin) and Identity (bdag nyid). The Condition (ngang) is the Basis of all (kun gzhi) -- primordially pure (ka dag) and not generated by primary and instrumental causes. It is the origin of all phenomena. The Ultimate Nature (rang bzhin) is said to be unaltered (ma bcos pa), because the Basis [gzhi] is spontaneously accomplished (lhun grub) in terms of its innate potential (rtsal) for manifestation (rol pa). The non-duality between the Ultimate Nature (i.e., the unaltered appearance of all phenomena) and the Condition (i.e., the Basis of all) is called the Identity (bdag nyid). This ''unicum'' of primordial purity (ka dag) and spontaneous accomplishment (lhun grub) is the Way of Being (gnas lugs) of the Pure-and-Perfect-Mind [byang chub (kyi) sems].&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, Donatella (1999). ''The Philosophical View of the Great Perfection in the Tibetan Bon Religion''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion. {{ISBN|1-55939-129-4}}, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra====
The term "''svabhāva''" is mentioned in six verses of the first chapter of the ''[[Avadhuta Gita|Avadhūta Gītā]]'': [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse5|1.5]], [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse6|1.6]], [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse44|1.44]], [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse54|1.54]], [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse58|1.58]], [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse76|1.76]].

This extreme nondual yoga text shares a lot of common language with the extreme nondual yoga of [[Atiyoga]] (Dzogchen) and its standard Tibetan analogue ''rang-bzhin'' (Wylie) is employed in ''[[The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra]],'' one of the ''[[Seventeen Tantras]]'' of Atiyoga [[Upadesha]].

Dzogchen strictly refutes the notion of "''svabhāva''", and so ''[[The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra]],'' states specifically that [[dharmakāya]] is non-arisen and natureless:

{{quote|...this meaningful supreme wisdom kāya&lt;br&gt;
ultimate, natureless [rang bzhin med], the state of the nonarising dharmakāya,&lt;br&gt;
the lamp of the teachings, the great light of the dharmakāya&lt;br&gt;
manifests to persons who are in accord with the meaning.&lt;ref&gt;'Kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long gi rgyud'. Source: [http://wikisource.org/wiki/Kun_tu_bzang_po_thugs_kyi_me_long_gi_rgyud] (accessed: Monday April 5, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;br&gt;

The following quotation from ''The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra'' is drawn from the [[Lungi Terdzö]]:{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The Lungi Terdzö (Wylie: ''lung-gi gter-mdzod'') is the prose autocommentary by [[Longchenpa]] (1308–1364 or possibly 1369) to his'' [[Chöying Dzö]]'' (Wylie: ''chos-dbyings mdzod'') -- which are numbered amongst the ''[[Seven Treasuries]]'' (Wylie: ''mdzod chen bdun'').

====Namkhai Norbu====
[[Dzogchen]] teacher [[Namkhai Norbu]] (2001: p.&amp;nbsp;155) in discussing the view of the [[pratyekabuddha]]s states that: 
{{quote|... the Pratyekabuddhas accede to the absence of a self or independent self-nature (bdag med).&lt;ref&gt;Norbu, Namkhai (2001).  ''The Precious Vase:  Instructions on the Base of Santi Maha Sangha'' (Shang Shung Edizioni, 2nd rev. ed., trans. from the Tibetan, edited and annotated by Adriano Clemente with the help of the author; trans. from Italian into English by Andy Lukianowicz), p. 155. Note that the [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Main_Page Dharma Dictionary] (2008) equates the Tibetan ''bdag-med'' with ''[[anātman]]'' (Sanskrit) (Dharma Dictionary, 2008, ''bdag med'', retrieved January 29, 2008 from http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/bdag_med).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was dedicated to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and is largely a treatise on how to properly train statesmen. It also discusses ethical dilemmas in the education system of the time. ''The Book of the Governor'' is evidence of the impact that [[Renaissance humanism]] had on prose writing.

== Thomas Elyot ==
[[File:Sir Thomas Elyot by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|Holbein Sir Thomas Elyot]]
Thomas Elyot was born before 1490 and died in 1546.  He was the son of Sir Richard Elyot and Alice Fynderne.  His father was a prominent lawyer, so Thomas received a quality education.  Both [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] claim him as an alumnus, but there is no sufficient evidence either way. He studied mostly liberal arts and philosophy, but also some medicine. In 1510 he married Margaret Aborough. In 1530 he was [[knight]]ed. In 1531, he was made ambassador to the Emperor, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].  In 1538 he published the first Latin-English dictionary. As a writer, he is clear, precise, measured, and practically monotonous. His major works include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlton-cambridgeshire.org.uk/History/People/sir_thomas_elyot.htm |title=Sir Thomas Elyot |publisher=Carlton-cambridgeshire.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Boke named the Governour'' (1531)
*''Of the Knowledge which maketh a Wise Man'' (1533)
*''The Education of Children, translated out of Plutarch'' (1535)
*''Dictionary'' (1538)
*''The Castle of Helth'' (1539)
*''The Defence of Good Women'' (1540)

''The Boke named the Governour'' is considered to be the first educational treatise in English.  It sets out the way of life for member of the English governing class.  Between 1531 and 1580, the book went through seven different editions. According to Biblio.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ELYOT, Sir Thomas [1490?-1546] |url=http://www.biblio.com/books/276879441.html |title=The Boke Named The Governour By Sir Thomas [1490?-1546&amp;#93; ELYOT - Used Books - 1557 - from D &amp; E Lake Ltd. (ABAC, ILAB) and |publisher=Biblio.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Book of the Governor "went through edition after edition all through the sixteenth century. It achieved this fame for many reasons. It is the first work in recognizably modern English [[prose]], to which Elyot added many new words. It provided influential advocacy for the study of the classics, from which he quotes extensively. the principal cause of its popularity was the current vogue for its subject – it is a treatise on moral philosophy, laying down the lines on which the education of those destined to govern should be directed, and inculcating the high moral principles which should rule them in the performance of their duties. There was nothing very original or revolutionary in the thoughts expressed: Elyot acknowledges his debt to the ''Institutio Principis Christiani'' of Erasmus and Castiglione’s ''Il Cortegiano'', though not that to Francesco Patrizzi, Bishop of Gaeta at the end of the fifteenth century, whose ''De Rego et Regis Institutione'' was certainly the model for ''The Governour''. Nevertheless it remained a textbook for behaviour for generations and had a lasting effect on the writing of English."

== Humanism ==
Elyot wrote his book at the beginning of English Renaissance humanism. During this time, "humanists were distinguished from other scholars not by exclusive focus on human or secular texts, but rather by their focus on secular writings, particularly classical ones, ''as well as'' on religious texts and thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;Black, Joseph. The Renaissance and the Early Seventeenth Century. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. Peterborough, Ont.: Broadview, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was during this time that the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] classics were finally coming back. This is the time when [[Plato]] played a significant role in philosophical history.  Renaissance humanism also introduced a new richness in the English language – writers began to use rhetoric, and language was viewed as a worthy subject to study. This is why Elyot's book became so popular not only with the people, but also the King.

"'''The Esoteric Character of the Gospels'''" is an article published in three parts: in November-December 1887, and in February 1888, in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] magazine [[Lucifer (magazine)|''Lucifer'']]; it was written by [[Helena Blavatsky]].{{refn|group=note|''Lucifer,'' Vol. 1, November 1887, p. 173–80; December 1887, p. 299–309; February 1888, p. 490–96.{{sfn|Index}}}} It was included in the 8th volume of the author's ''Collected Writings.''{{sfn|Price|1985}} In 1888, for this work, the author was awarded [[Tallapragada Subba Row|Subba Row]] medal.{{sfn|Theowiki}}{{refn|group=note|When the [[Theosophical Society]] was created, the encouraging of "the study of [[comparative religion]], philosophy, and science" was proclaimed his second major task.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992}}}}

== Analysis of contents ==
=== Versus clerics ===
An American author [[Gary Lachman]], noting Blavatsky's "animus toward the Judeo-Christian ethos," has cited her article in which she writes that "[[Christianity]] is now the religion of arrogance ''par excellence,'' a stepping-stone for ambition, a sinecure for wealth, sham and power; a convenient screen for hypocrisy."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=176|Lachman|2012|2p=112}} A Russian Indologist [[Alexander Senkevich]] has noted that she did not make secrets out of her "skeptical attitude towards the [[Gospel]]s," considering them unrelated to either [[Jesus]] or his [[Apostles]].{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=297}}{{refn|group=note|Noting in church Christianity the dogmatism generated by the "painful ambition of its hierarchs," Blavatsky regarded it exclusively as a religious sanctification of "power over people."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=298}}}} Joseph Tyson wrote in his book that, according to Blavatsky, for example, in the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] camp there are 350 dissenting [[sect]]s, and she commented that if "one of these may have the approximate truth, still 349 must be necessarily false."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=175|Tyson|2006|2p=384}} A Russian philosopher Lydia Fesenkova wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, the Christian sacred books are "magazines of falsehoods," and all of them have served {{quote|"as a means for securing power and of supporting the ambitious policy of an unscrupulous priesthood. All have promoted superstition, all made of their gods blood-thirsty and ever-damning Molochs and fiends, as all have made nations to serve the latter more than the God of Truth."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1pp=179–80|Фесенкова|2001|2p=18}}}}

Professor [[Robert Ellwood]] wrote that Blavatsky was a ruthless critic of the church tradition of Christianity, whether in relation to "the [[Church Fathers]] or modern priests, pastors and missionaries." The reason for her hostility to church Christianity "was what she perceived as arrogance combined with misplaced concreteness." She believed that "churchmen, past and present, whether through intentional deceit or mere stupidity, had concealed the real origin and meaning of Christianity as a vehicle of the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|ancient wisdom]]."{{sfn|Ellwood}}

=== Historical Jesus ===
A Russian orthodox theologian, Dimitry Drujinin wrote that in her article Blavatsky calls [[Lod|Lüd]] as the "hometown" of Jesus. This indicates that she supported the statements of [[Talmud]] that Jesus was the [[Yeshu|son of a man named Pandira]] and "lived a hundred years before the beginning of the Gospel events." In his youth, he lived for many years in Egypt, where he "was initiated" in esoteric wisdom. After returning to Palestine, he reorganized the movement of the [[Essenes]], who worshipped him as a teacher. Slandered by his enemies, he was killed in his hometown. Drujinin quotes the article with "He was stoned and then crucified on a tree, on the eve of [[Passover]]."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=189|Дружинин|2012|2p=68}}

=== Chrestos and Christos ===
Drujinin wrote that, according to Blavatsky, it is necessary to distinguish between Chrêstos and [[Christ (title)|Christos]] (Christ). The first name, in hers opinion, means neophyte who approaching to Initiation, and the second one she defines in this way: "Christ— the true esoteric [[Salvation in Christianity|'''Saviour''']]—is no man, but the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|'''Divine Principle''']] in every human being."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=173|Дружинин|2012|2p=66}}{{refn|group=note|"'''Chrestes''', '''Chrestos''' (Greek). Applied by the Greeks as a title of respect equivalent to 'the worthy.' Chrestes meant an interpreter of oracles. In the language of the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Mysteries]], a chrestos was a candidate or neophyte, and a christos (anointed) was an initiate. Christ is a mystical expression for the human [[Ātman (Hinduism)|inner god]], while chrest is the good but as yet unregenerated nature."{{sfn|Glossary|1999|loc=Chrestes}}}} Drujinin added that she believes that Christians have lost the understanding of the true meaning of the word Christos: "The very meaning of the terms Chrêstos and Christos, and the bearing of both on 'Jesus of Nazareth,' a name coined out of Joshua the Nazar, has now become a dead letter for all with the exception of non-Christian Occultists."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=215|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}} He wrote that Christians, according to Blavatsky, only afterwards unfairly put aside "all the other Chrêstoi, who have appeared to them as rivals of their Man-God."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=205|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}} The Russian ''Encyclopedia of Sages, Mystics, and Magicians'' wrote that in her article Blavatsky "allegorically" proclaims: "Christos was 'the '''Way''',' while Chrêstos was the lonely traveller journeying on to reach the ultimate goal through that 'Path,' which goal was Christos, the glorified Spirit of ''''Truth'''.'"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=189|Беренс|2003|2p=64}} In a like manner Drujinin has quoted hers article: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"To the true follower of the '''Spirit of Truth''', it matters little, therefore, whether Jesus, as man and Chrêstos, lived during the era called Christian, or before, or never lived at all. The Adepts, who lived and died for humanity, have existed in many and all the ages."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=204|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tyson wrote that "sanctification," in Blavatsky's opinion, "was ever the synonym (for) the '[[Mahatma|Mahatmic]]-condition,' i.e., the union of the man with the divine principle (Augoeides) in him."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=190|Tyson|2006|2p=183}} In this connection, he has said that [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] friars "practiced fasting, celibacy, contemplative prayer, and charity in order to," as Blavatsky writes, "kill one's personality and its passions, to blot out... separateness from one's 'Father,' the Divine [[Spirit]] in man."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=201|Tyson|2006|2p=183}}

=== Esotericism in the Gospels ===
While studying the Theosophical doctrine, Drujinin has stated that Blavatsky considers the "story of Jesus Christ," which was told in the Gospels, as a fantasy. In support of this he has quoted hers article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whence, then, the Gospels, the life of Jesus of Nazareth? Has it not been repeatedly stated that no human, mortal brain could have invented the life of the Jewish Reformer, followed by the awful drama on [[Calvary]]? We say on the authority of the [[esoteric]] Eastern School, that all this came from the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], as far as the name [[Christ (title)|Christos]] and the astronomico-mystical allegories are concerned, and from the writings of the ancient [[Tannaim|Tanaïm]] as regards the [[Kabbalah|Kabalistic]] connection of Jesus or Joshua, with the Biblical personifications."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=210|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to French philosopher [[Édouard Schuré]], [[Esoteric Christianity|Christian esotericism]] in the Gospels is revealed if to approach them from the standpoint of the "[[Essenes|Essenian]] and Gnostic traditions."{{sfn|Schuré|1921}} A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] stated that the "Gospels" in ancient times were not "the biographies of one, or of any, living earthly person, but were held as the literary forms of a universal dramatical representation of the experience of our divine [[soul]]s in the mortal body here on earth."{{sfn|Kuhn|1990|p=9}}

== Criticism ==
This article by Blavatsky always aroused rejection on the part of those who professed the teachings of Jesus only literally.{{sfn|Cranston|1993}} Thus, a priest Drujinin ([[Russian Orthodox Church]]) claimed that the Theosophists "had reduced" Jesus Christ to the level of one of the Adepts and even generally questioned his existence.{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=68}} And moreover:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The founders of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] deny the importance of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]]. Recognizing within the framework of the concepts [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]] the possibility of paying by sufferings only for their own sins, they actually represent the sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ only as a tragicomic mistake."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=68}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On the other hand, Alvin Kuhn, being a supporter of [[Christ myth theory]], stated that esotericism "hung up midway" between recognizing the Gospels as documents of early Christian history or treating them as an allegory. He wrote that Blavatsky contributed to this "anomalous" situation: arguing in one place that "Christ— the true esoteric '''Saviour'''—is no man, but the '''Divine Principle''' in every human being,"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=173|Kuhn|1990|2p=16}} she in another place supports a thesis about the real existence of the [[Master Jesus|Jewish Adept Jesus]]. Kuhn proclaimed: "The matter of the existence or non-existence of a certain man in human history is not dual in nature. Either Jesus, the Gospel Figure, was a person in human body, or he was not."{{sfn|Kuhn|1990|p=17}}

According to Ellwood, many of Blavatsky's "onslaughts" against Christianity, including her attacks on organizations that devoted themselves to "good works such as [[the Salvation Army]], were not always even-handed." Moreover, she apparently didn't know about the nascent [[Liberal Christianity|liberal branch of Christian theology]] — "[[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], Coleridge, [[William Ellery Channing|Channing]], Kingsley and many others" who had nothing to do to the primitive "dogmatism she so hated." Nevertheless, her attacks on church Christianity can be seen as necessary to fulfill the task of the [[Theosophical Society]] connected with the formation of a "new spirituality based on an immanent universalism" which opposing [[Religious intolerance|aggressive religiosity]] "she saw all around, whether in European bishops or in missionaries abroad."{{sfn|Ellwood}}

'''The Game''' is a [[mental game]] where the objective is to avoid thinking about The Game itself. Thinking about The Game constitutes a loss, which must be announced each time it occurs. It is impossible to win most versions of The Game. Depending on the variation of The Game, the whole world, or all those aware of the game, are playing it all the time. Tactics have been developed to increase the number of people aware of The Game and thereby increase the number of losses.

== Gameplay ==
There are three commonly reported rules to The Game:&lt;ref name="nebraskan"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailynebraskan.com/mind-game-enlivens-students-across-u-s/article_8770c834-d289-52d5-a6c8-b6fac8c98263.html|title=Mind game enlivens students across U.S.|first=Andy|last=Boyle|date=19 March 2007|newspaper=The Daily Nebraskan|access-date=18 May 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="depers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Rules"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2008/12/03/three-rules-of-the-game-210986/|title=Three rules of The Game|date=2008-12-03|newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rutland"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MCNP&amp;p_multi=RHDB&amp;p_theme=mcnp&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=11C0ED30E5F12A50&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Don't think about the game|work=[[Rutland Herald]]|date=3 October 2007|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Everyone in the world is playing The Game. (This is alternatively expressed as, "Everybody in the world who knows about The Game is playing The Game" or "You are always playing The Game.") A person cannot refuse to play The Game; it does not require consent to play and one can never stop playing.
# Whenever one thinks about The Game, one loses.
# Losses must be announced. This can be verbally, with a phrase such as "I just lost The Game", or in any other way: for example, via [[Facebook]]. Some people may have ways to remind others of The Game.

The definition of "thinking about The Game" is not always clear. If one discusses The Game without realizing that they have lost, this may or may not constitute a loss. If someone says "What is The Game?" before understanding the rules, whether they have lost is up for interpretation. According to some interpretations, one does not lose when someone else announces their loss, although the second rule implies that one loses regardless of what made them think about The Game. After a player has announced a loss, or after one thinks of The Game, some variants allow for a [[grace period]] between three seconds to thirty minutes to forget about the game, during which the player cannot lose the game again.&lt;ref name="canpress"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080117/thegame_youlose_080117|title=Teens around the world are playing 'the game'|work=[[The Canadian Press]]|date=17 January 2008|first=Shannon|last=Montgomery}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lal"/&gt;

The common rules do not define a point at which The Game ends. However, some players state that The Game ends when the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] announces on television that "The Game is up."&lt;ref name="The Rules"/&gt;

=== Strategies ===
Strategies focus on making others lose The Game. Common methods include saying "The Game" out loud or writing about The Game on a hidden note, in graffiti in public places, or on banknotes.&lt;ref name="depers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.depers.nl/entertainment/269673/Nederland-gaat-nu-ook-verliezen.html|title=Nederland gaat nu ook verliezen|work=[[De Pers]]|date=15 December 2008|first=Sanne|last=Rooseboom|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215183945/http://www.depers.nl/entertainment/269673/Nederland-gaat-nu-ook-verliezen.html|archivedate=15 December 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2008/12/03/if-you-read-this-youve-lost-the-game-210990/|title=If you read this you've lost The Game|date=3 December 2008|newspaper=[[Metro (British Newspaper)|Metro]]|access-date=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Associations may be made with The Game, especially over time, so that one thing inadvertently causes one to lose. Some players enjoy thinking of elaborate pranks that will cause others to lose the game.&lt;ref name="kansas"/&gt;

Other strategies involve merchandise: T-shirts, buttons, mugs, posters and bumper stickers have been created to advertise The Game. The Game is also spread via social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter.&lt;ref name="kansas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/851/story/1336405.html|title='The Game' is a fad that will get you every time|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724150953/http://www.kansascity.com/851/story/1336405.html|deadurl=yes|date=21 July 2009|archivedate=24 July 2009|work=[[The Kansas City Star]]|last=Fussell|first=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
[[File:You lose The Game.jpg|thumb|right|A woman holds up a sign reading "You Lose The Game".]]
The origins of The Game are uncertain. In a 2008 news article, Justine Wettschreck says The Game has probably been around since the early 1990s, and may have originated in Australia or England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dglobe.com/content/column-playing-game-other-kids|title=Playing 'The Game' with the other kids|last=Wettschreck|first=Justine|publisher=[[Daily Globe (Worthington)|Daily Globe]]|date=31 May 2008|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory is that it was invented in [[London]] in 1996 when two British engineers, Dennis Begley and Gavin McDowall, missed their last train and had to spend the night on the platform; they attempted to avoid thinking about their situation and whoever thought about it first lost.&lt;ref name="lal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt; Another theory also traces The Game to London in 1996, when it was created by Jamie Miller "to annoy people".&lt;ref name="canpress"/&gt; Journalist Mic Wright of ''The Next Web'' recalled playing The Game at school in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/media/2015/04/13/you-just-lost-again/|title=You just lost The Game: the enduring hold of the pre-Web world’s Rickroll|last=Wright|first=Mic|work=The Next Web|date=April 13, 2015|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, The Game may have been created in 1977 by members of the [[Cambridge University Science Fiction Society]] when attempting to create a game that did not fit in with [[game theory]]. A blog post by Paul Taylor in August 2002 described The Game; Taylor claimed to have "found out about [the game] online about 6 months ago".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arseburgers.co.uk/blog/archives/000246.html|title=The Game (I lost!).|date=10 August 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614182818/http://www.arseburgers.co.uk/blog/archives/000246.html|archivedate=14 June 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the earliest known reference on the internet.&lt;ref name=canpress/&gt;

The Game is most commonly spread through the internet, such as via [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]], or by word of mouth.&lt;ref name="kansas"/&gt;

== Psychology ==
{{see also|Ironic process theory}}
The Game is an example of ironic processing (also known as the "White Bear Principle"), in which attempts to avoid certain thoughts make those thoughts more persistent.&lt;ref name="lal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laloyolan.com/opinion/you-just-lost-the-game/article_597f90c7-7397-5050-87a1-229cbf4317e3.html|title=You just lost the Game|last=Kaniewski|first=Katie|date=1 March 2009|work=Los Angeles Loyolan|accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are early examples of ironic processing: in 1840, [[Leo Tolstoy]] played the "white bear game" with his brother, where he would "stand in a corner and not think of the white bear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tolstoy|first=Leo|authorlink=Leo Tolstoy|date=2008|title=Leo Tolstoy, His Life and Work|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3M2WxoNXUzIC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=|archiveurl=https://archive.org/stream/leotolstoyhislif00biriiala/leotolstoyhislif00biriiala_djvu.txt|archivedate=6 July 2014|isbn=1408676974}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] mentioned the same game in 1863 in the essay ''[[Winter Notes on Summer Impressions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFLsy9JR-RsC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=%22Try+to+pose+for+yourself+this+task:+not+to+think+of+a+polar+bear+and+you+will+see+that+the+cursed+thing+will+come+to+mind+every+minute.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8qrPzep_wL&amp;sig=kY3nobR8ZmN36IAINHtagca5A4k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s_fLS4PcD4SyrAeYvrGXBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Try%20to%20pose%20for%20yourself%20this%20task%3A%20not%20to%20think%20of%20a%20polar%20bear%20and%20you%20will%20see%20that%20the%20cursed%20thing%20will%20come%20to%20mind%20every%20minute.%22&amp;f=false|title=Winter Notes on Summer Impressions|page=49|last=Dostoyevsky|first=Fyodor|publisher=''[[Vremya (magazine)|Vremya]]''|date=1863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The Game has been described as challenging and fun to play, and as pointless, childish and infuriating.&lt;ref name="canpress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lal"/&gt; In some [[Internet forum]]s, such as [[Something Awful]] and [[GameSpy]], and several schools, The Game has been banned.&lt;ref name="depers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt;

The 2009 [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]] poll was [[Time 100#Hacking|most likely manipulated]] by the hacktivist group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], so that the top 21 people's names formed an [[acrostic]] for "marblecake also the game", referencing The Game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/time-magazine-throws-up-its-hands-as-it-gets-pwned-by-4chan/|title=Time Magazine Throws Up Its Hands As It Gets Pwned By 4Chan|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|last=Schonfeld|first=Erick|date=27 April 2009|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2009/04/marble-cake-and/|title=Marble Cake and moot|work=[[ABC News]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111113606/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2009/04/marble-cake-and|deadurl=yes|date=30 April 2009|accessdate=2 November 2014|archivedate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1212">'''Triploid block''' is a phenomenon describing the formation of nonviable [[offspring|progeny]] after [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridization]] of [[flowering plants]] that differ in [[ploidy]]. The barrier is established in the [[endosperm]], a nutritive tissue supporting [[embryo]] growth.&lt;ref name=Kohler&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Köhler|first1=C|last2=Mittelsten Scheid|first2=O|last3=Erilova|first3=A|title=The impact of the triploid block on the origin and evolution of polyploid plants |journal=Trends in Genetics |date=Mar 2010 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=142–8 |pmid=20089326 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.12.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marks|first1=G.

'''Vivid''' (stylised as '''VIVID''') was a centre for the production and exhibition of [[media art]], located in the [[Digbeth]] area of [[Birmingham]], [[England]].

Vivid commissioned and exhibited work both for its own exhibition space and for other locations, provided spaces and resources for the production of interdisciplinary art and hosted a programme of residencies for visiting artists, commissioned major new works and large scale touring exhibitions from artists and exhibited artists' work.

After failing to win Arts Council funding Vivid closed in 2012. [[Vivid Projects]] was started soon after by the Vivid curatorial team and is based at Minerva Works in Digbeth.

==Function==
Vivid commissioned and exhibited work both for its own exhibition space and for other locations, provided spaces and resources for the production of interdisciplinary art and hosted a programme of residencies for visiting artists,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.vividprojects.org.uk/archive/ Archive]" Vivid Projects. Accessed 5 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; commissioned major new works and large scale touring exhibitions from artists including [[Haroon Mirza]], [[Richard Billingham]], Heather &amp; Ivan Morison and exhibited artists from 1960 [[Fluxus]] movement to rising art stars. In 2008–11 it generated 27 international residencies and exhibitions with Vivid commissions presented at the [[Venice Biennale]], [[Frieze Art Fair]], The Art of Ideas and [[British Art Show]] 7; and touring to London and Gothenburg.

Vivid produced and curated emerging and mid-career artists and presented their work in local, national and international contexts. Described in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as 'superb' the critically acclaimed public programme presented a wide variety of new commissions, thematic shows, talks, screenings and pop up events year round.

==History==
The company began trading as Vivid in the late 1990s, but was established as Birmingham Centre for Media Arts in 1992, when TURC Video amalgamated with the community arts organisation Wide Angle. The conjunction of the two entities created a hybrid resource unique in Birmingham: a film, video and photography workshop creating community access to what at the time was the dominant means of visual communications.

Popularly known in the 1990s as BCMA, the centre adopted the name Vivid following a re-location to The Big Peg in Birmingham's jewellery quarter and began several years of digital image making, digital video training and artist development. From 2000 Vivid concentrated on developing contemporary new media and artist moving image through production, commissioning, exhibition and event programmes.

The organisation moved to its final home, called The Garage - a former motor garage built in the 1950s - from its previous location in the [[Jewellery Quarter]] in April 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birminghampost/reviews/tm_method=full%26objectid=15576683%26siteid=50002-name_page.html Terry Grimley Welcomes A New Art Venue In Eastside] [[Birmingham Post]], 31 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Renovation of the large [[MOT test|MOT]] garage, in order to provide an exhibition and events programme alongside artist production, created a flexible, multi-purpose space for Digbeth - the first in the area. The Garage, occupied {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} and still bore the evidence of its former use as a vehicle repair workshop, including a large area marked "MOT Bay".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vivid.org.uk/facilities.php?page=Venue%20Hire Facilities] Vivid&lt;/ref&gt;

After failing to win Arts Council funding Vivid closed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actsofmemory.net/recitations-to-date/act-41-vivid-birmingham/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vivid.org.uk Farewell and a link to the future] Vivid&lt;/ref&gt; Vivid Projects was started soon after by the Vivid curatorial team and is based at Minerva Works in Digbeth.&lt;ref&gt;http://new.a-n.co.uk/news/single/vivid-projects-how-long-will-they-last&lt;/ref&gt;
