'''ANSI C12.20''' is an [[ANSI]] standard that describes an American National Standard for Electricity Meters - accuracy and performance.

The C12.20 standard established the physical aspects and performance criteria for a meter's [[accuracy class]].  It refines certain details in [[ANSI C12.1]] and [[ANSI C12.10]].

The existing ANSI accuracy classes for electric meters are:
* Class .5 - having ± 0.5% accuracy.
* Class .2 - having ± 0.2% accuracy.

Outside North America, [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standards are used for electric meters.

'''Aerobic granular reactor''' is a type of waste treatment facility.

==Overview==
[[Sewage treatment]] plants (STP) based on [[activated sludge]] often cover large surface areas, necessitated mainly by the large [[settling tank]]s. To build compact STP’s, [[biomass]] can be grown as [[biofilms]] on a carrier material, or as fast settling [[Aerobic granulation|aerobic granular sludge]] without a carrier.  Recent research showed the advantages of a discontinuously fed system, in which it is possible to grow stable granulated sludge under aerobic conditions.

Simultaneous [[Chemical oxygen demand]], and [[Nitrogen]] and [[Phosphorus]] removal, can be easily integrated in a discontinuous fed system.  Because of the high settling capacity of the granules, the use of a traditional settler is unnecessary.  Therefore the installation can be built very compact, needing only 20% of the surface area of conventional activated sludge systems.

==History==
[[File:Patrick G. Spence.jpg|thumb|Patrick G. Spence]]
Whilst the roots of Aitken Spence can be dated back to Wilson &amp; Archer Partnership of the 1830s in the early [[British Ceylon|British Colonial Ceylon]], the company began to take its current form after the signing of a formal partnership agreement between Thomas Clark and Patrick Gordon Spence—Scottish merchants and shipping agents&lt;ref name="Trading"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wright | first = Arnold |title= Twentieth Century Impressions of Ceylon: Its History, People, Commerce.. |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eUF_rS8FEoIC&amp;pg=PA437 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Galle]]—on 1 September 1868, wherein Clark Spence &amp; Co. was established.&lt;ref name="ARtimeline"&gt;{{cite web | last = Aitken Spence| year = 2011| title= Aitken Spence Company Annual Report 2010-2011: Time Line |pages = 182–183 | url = http://www.aitkenspence.com/pdf/ar2011/aitken_spence_company_annual_report_2010_2011.pdf | accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FoundingHistory"&gt;{{cite news | title = The Rootage of Insurance in Sri Lanka | author = M.Z.M.

On 5 April 1871, Patrick Gordon Spence, secured Clark Spence &amp; Co. as the sole agent of Lloyd's of London in [[Ceylon]].&lt;ref name="FoundingHistory"/&gt; In order to service the Agency for the [[Lloyd's|Lloyd's of London]] for the [[Port of Colombo]], Clark Spence &amp; Co. partnered with Britton, Aitken &amp; Co. to open a branch office in [[Colombo]]. On New Year's Day, 1873, E.C. Britton opted out of the Britton, Aitken &amp; Co. partnership, resulting in Patrick Gordon Spence, Edward Aitken and S.R. Aitken coming together to form Aitken Spence &amp; Co. to manage the operations in Colombo, whilst Clark Spence &amp; Co. continued in partnership to operate in Galle.&lt;ref name="ARtimeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FoundingHistory"/&gt; In 1876, Aitken Spence &amp; Co. obtained the Lloyds agency from Clark Spence &amp; Co.&lt;ref name="ARtimeline"/&gt; Aitken Spence had also obtained the local agency of [[Morgan Crucible| Morgan Crucible Company]] for trading in plumbago.&lt;ref name="Trading" /&gt; As Colombo became the commercial capital of Sri Lanka, Aitken Spence &amp; Co became more prominent and subsequently its partner company, Clark Spence &amp; Co. originally based in Galle, became a subsidiary of Aitken Spence &amp; Co.&lt;ref name="LMDcorporateHistory"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lanka Monthly Digest (LMD)| year = 2013| title= Corporate Heritage: Aitken Spence | url = http://lmd.lk/2013/12/26/corporate-heritage-profiles-9/| accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Edward Aitken.jpg|thumb|Edward Aitken]]
By the 1880s, Aitken Spence had also secured the shipping agencies [[:nl:Koninklijke Rotterdamsche Lloyd|Koninklijke Rotterdamsche Lloyd]] and [[Netherland Line|Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland]] for Ceylon.&lt;ref name="dutchshipping"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lorck| year = 1912| title= Isles of the East: An Illustrated Guide. | url = https://archive.org/stream/cu31924010584682/cu31924010584682_djvu.txt| accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company moved into plantations sector as an agency house in the early 1900s and with the onset of the Great Depression, began to withdraw from its trading business. In 1918, Aitken Spence purchased the Freudenberg Building in Colombo, and made it its company headquarters having renamed the building as Lloyds Building. As a pioneer in port operations, Aitken Spence was entrusted in coordinating the Operations of Colombo Port during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="ARtimeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FoundingHistory"/&gt;

Aitken Spence became a Private Company in 1952.&lt;ref name="ARtimeline"/&gt; In its centenary year, 1968, it appointed its first Sri Lankan Chairman,&lt;ref name="ARtimeline"/&gt; E.L. Van Langenberg.&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;{{cite web | last = Aitken Spence|title= Our Heritage |url= http://www.aitkenspence.com/about_us/shipping_tourism_insurance_industry_sri_lanka.asp |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1971, as Sri Lanka was preparing to end British dominion and declare as [[Sri Lanka#Independence|republic]], the company became a wholly Sri Lankan owned entity.&lt;ref name="CompanyOwner"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shalini Perera | year = 2011| title= Corporate Ownership and Control | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VXT36YV6RBIC&amp;pg=PA124 | accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, it began to offer shares to its executives, thereby broad basing its ownership. The company eventually moved on from this model and in 1983 offered its shares to the general public on the [[Colombo Stock Exchange]] with an issued share capital of Rs. 51 million.&lt;ref name="ARtimeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LMDcover"&gt;{{cite news | title = Aitken Spence Historic Milestones  | newspaper = LMD | location = Colombo, Sri Lanka | date = September 2005 | url = http://lmd.lk/archives/2005/September/cov7.htm | accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1960s and early 1970s, Insurance and Plantations sectors—which were core business segments of Aitken Spence, where the company had been well established at the time—were nationalized.&lt;ref name="Nationalized"&gt;{{cite news |title= Changing of the guard at Aitken Spence|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/011230/bus3.html|newspaper= The Sunday Times |date= 30 December 2001|accessdate= 5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nationalization"&gt;{{cite news |title= R.

Despite the setbacks from nationalization, in realizing the then government's thrust to boost tourism, Aitken Spence launched its tourism segment in 1972 with investments in its first hotel (Neptune Hotel in Beruwala, Sri Lanka opened in 1974).&lt;ref name="Nationalized"/&gt; The company then entered into Aviation in 1974 (as general sales agent for [[Singapore Airlines]] in Sri Lanka).&lt;ref name="ARtimeline"/&gt; In consolidating its travel agency business that had begun with the launch of Aitken Spence Hotels in 1974, Aitken Spence set up Aitken Spence Travels in 1977 as inbound and outbound tour operators in Sri Lanka and as agents for [[Eurail]] and Britrail.&lt;ref name="ARtimeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TravelsFormation"&gt;{{cite news |title= Prema Cooray : A long and colourful journey|url= http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2002/12/15/bus17.html|newspaper= The Sunday Observer |date= 15 December 2002|accessdate= 15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism is now a core business segment of Aitken Spence.

With Sri Lanka adopting open market economic policies focused on export led growth in 1977, Aitken Spence forayed further into new business segments : Container and allied services in 1979; Garments and apparels in 1979;&lt;ref name="garmentsweb"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aitkenspence.com/strategic_investments/garment_manufacture_in_sri_lanka.asp |title= Garment Manufacture|accessdate= October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; International courier service agency with [[TNT N.V.|TNT]] in 1981;&lt;ref name="ARtimeline"/&gt; and Elevators in 1989 as agent of [[Otis Elevator Company|OTIS]].&lt;ref name="ARtimeline"/&gt; With insurance sector being deregulated in the 1980s, the Group played a pivotal role in the resurgence of private sector insuarance as a proponent of the National Insurance Corporation and Union Assuarance Ltd, stakes in which Aitken Spence subsequently divested. Aitken Spence reentered Plantations sector, when the sector was reprivatized in 1992,  through its stake in Udapussellawa Plantation PLC that was later divested.

In response to the Power Crisis in Sri Lanka in 1996, Aitken Spence began to explore investment opportunities in power generation sector, with first two power plants coming online in 2002.&lt;ref name="jvjp"&gt;{{cite news |title= CEB grid to get 20 mega watt boost |url= http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2002/03/10/bus01.html |newspaper= The Sunday Observer |date= 10 March 2002 |accessdate= 9 October 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924111719/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2002/03/10/bus01.html |archive-date= 24 September 2015 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Group also maintained container vessel operations, with acquisition of five ships in a joint venture with Ceyline Group in 2003, which it later divested in 2008. In 2010, in continuing its partnership with Ceyline Group, Aitken Spence invested in [[Colombo International Nautical and Engineering College|CINEC]], Sri Lanka's largest private higher education institution. In 2004, Aitken Spence Travels partnered with [[TUI Group]] of Germany to form a joint venture that is the largest leisure, travel and tourism company in the world.

Aitken Spence was the first Sri Lankan resort operator to embark on overseas resort operations having acquired Bathala Island Resort of [[Maldives]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="ARtimeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TourismInnovation"&gt;{{cite news |title= Kandalama, Club Rannhali my indelible moments|url= http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=62856|newspaper= The Island |date= 2 October 2012|accessdate= 15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Aitken Spence entered [[Bangladesh]] through Aitken Spence Cargo with its shipping services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Aitken Spence Cargo| title= About Ace Cargo |url= http://www.acecargo.lk/about-acecargo.html|accessdate=17 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, in 2006, Aitken Spence entered the Indian hospitality sector, having secured management contracts for five hotel properties in [[India]].&lt;ref name="ARtimeline"/&gt; On the same year, the company broke new ground by becoming the first Sri Lankan company to venture into port efficiency management outside of Sri Lanka, when it undertook to improve efficiency of ports in the African continent.&lt;ref name="ARtimeline"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Sri Lanka Aitken Spence to make Mozambique port efficient |url=http://www.lankabusinessonline.com/fullstory.php?nid=1702158326 |newspaper= Lanka Business Online |date= 12 June 2011 |accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company increased its global presence even further by obtaining the management of four hotel properties in [[Oman]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="ARtimeline"/&gt; In 2013, Aitken Spence announced its proposed venture into [[Fiji]] to manage the Ports of [[Suva]] and [[Lautoka]] in a public private partnership with the Government of Fiji.&lt;ref name="fijiPortMgmt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=FijiPort&gt;{{cite news |title= Aitken Spence PLC takes over the management of two major ports in Fiji |url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/130505/business-times/aitken-spence-plc-takes-over-the-management-of-two-major-ports-in-fiji-42782.html |newspaper= The Sunday Times |date= 5 May 2013 |accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Group has expressed interest to further diversify its investments in Fiji, venturing into hospitality, power and printing sectors.&lt;ref name=FijiDiversity&gt;{{cite news |title= Company plans for more investment in Fiji |url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=293963 |newspaper= The Fiji Times Online |date= 4 February 2015 |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the company has operations in eight countries (Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bangladesh, India, South Africa, Oman, Fiji and Myanmar), spanning several continents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Aitken Spence Company Annual Report 2017-2018:Our Network |pages = 8, 28–33 | url = http://aitkenspence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Aitken-Spence-PLC-AR-2017-18.pdf | accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 13,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= |year= 2018 |title= Corporate Video|url= http://www.aitkenspence.com/about_us/hotels_logistics_power_sri_lanka.asp |language=  |publisher= Aitken Spence|accessdate=21 March 2012|time= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ARKeyEvents&gt;{{cite web |title= Aitken Spence Annual Report Key Events 2017/2018|author= Aitken Spence |accessdate=18 June 2018 |url= http://aitkenspence.com/annualreport/#KeyEvents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ace Power Embilipitiya thermal power plant opeartes on a 100MW while the Branford Hydro power plant operates at 2.5MW, Ace Wind power plant at 3MW  and Western Power at 10MW capacity. &lt;ref name=ARACEPOWER&gt;{{cite web |title= Aitken Spence Annual Report 2017/2018|author= Aitken Spence |accessdate=10 July 2018 |url= http://aitkenspence.com/annualreport/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between the [[Ceylon Electricity Board]] and Ace Power Embilipitiya lapsed in 2015; however, renewed the agreement for a one more year in April, 2016, when the country ran into power crisis after two back-to-back blackouts in late 2015 and early 2016. During the first quarter of 2018, the government decided to extend the purchasing of the thermal power for three more years as the country had four seasons of back-to-back dry spells, which exhausted reservoirs and the crucial catchment areas.&lt;ref name="acepower"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Government-extends-agreement-with-Ace-Power-for-three-more-years-to-avert-power-crisis-148133.html |title= Government extends agreement with Ace Power for three more years to avert power crisis |newspaper = Mirror Business |accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aitken Spence has also sought to diversify its power portfolio with increased presence in the clean and renewable energy domain in Sri Lanka.

Aitken Spence Power has already completed construction of the 2.5 MW '''Branford Hydro Power''' Plant in Matale, and of [[Ambewela Aitken Spence Wind Farm|Ace Wind Power]] power plant in [[Ambewela]]&lt;ref name="renew"&gt;{{cite news|title=Blue chips eye more hydro, wind power plants |newspaper=Daily News |location=Colombo, Sri Lanka |date=8 June 2011 |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/06/08/bus05.asp |accessdate=9 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823125438/http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/06/08/bus05.asp |archivedate=23 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that has an installed capacity of 3 MW.

Ace Power embarked on a landmark project in the country's waste to energy sphere. Seen as a vital and much needed solution for the waste disposal crisis within Colombo city limits, the proposed project involves the construction of a 10MW waste-toenergy plant at Muthurajawela. The plant will be fuelled by waste collected from the Colombo Municipal Area, which was previously dumped in Meethotamulla. The plant is equipped to convert between 600 – 800 metric tonnes of municipal solid waste daily to electricity. Estimated to cost Rs. 13 billion on completion, the project is funded through a combination of equity and term loan funding. The construction work on the project commenced following the ground-breaking ceremony held in August 2017 with the participation of H.E. the president. This new waste to energy project is due to commence commercial operations in 2019.&lt;ref name="wastetoenergy"&gt;{{cite news | title = Sri Lanka starts work on two 10MW waste-to-energy plants | newspaper = Economy Next | date = 10 August 2017 | url = http://www.economynext.com/Sri_Lanka_starts_work_on_two_10MW_waste_to_energy_plants-3-8486-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wastetoenergyplant"&gt;{{cite news | title = HNB concludes Syndicated Term Loan for Sri Lanka’s first waste to energy plant | newspaper = Lanka Business Online | date = 31 May 2018 | url = http://www.lankabusinessonline.com/hnb-concludes-syndicated-term-loan-for-sri-lankas-first-waste-to-energy-plant/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plantation services===
[[File:Dunsinane Estate, Elpitiya Plantation.jpg|thumb|left| Dunsinane Estate, Nuwara Eliya]]
Aitken Spence has been in the plantations industry from the early 1900s.&lt;ref name="superbrand"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.superbrands.com/lkb1/pdf/aitkenspence.pdf |title= Aitken Spence|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the estates originally owned by Aitken Spence were acquired under the plantation nationalization program. In 1992, with the re-privatization of plantations industry, Aitken Spence reentered the sector in taking over the management of Udapussellawa Plantation PLC. It also invested in a minority stake in Talawakelle Plantations. Aitken Spence later divested its stake in Udapussellawa and Talawakelle Plantations&lt;ref name="talawakelle"&gt;{{cite news | title = Talawakelle posts record profit and turnover| newspaper = The Island| location = Colombo, Sri Lanka| date = 2 April 2011 | url = http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=22230| accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The management of Elpitiya Plantations PLC was taken over by Aitken Spence in 1997 from Carsons through Aitken Spence Plantations Managements Ltd. The Group currently manages 13 estates (with over 8800 hectares of cultivated land) in Sri Lanka, producing high, mid and low grown teas.&lt;ref name=ARplantationssummary&gt;{{cite web |title= Aitken Spence Annual Report 2017/2018|author= Aitken Spence |accessdate=5 June 2018 |url= http://aitkenspence.com/annualreport/}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 13 estates, six estates are located on the up cluster in [[Kandy]] and [[Nuwara Eliya]] districts (estates: Dunsinane, Sheen, Fernlands, Meddecombra, New Peacock and Nayapane) and seven estates in the low cluster (Deviturai, Talgaswella, Gulugahakanda, Lelwala, Ketandola, Bentota and Elpitiya). These estates conform with multiple standards on sustainability

===Printing===

In 1955, Clark Spence &amp; Co. opened its own press to service its internal printing needs in Galle. Printing services were gradually opened for external parties and with the higher demand, the service offering was expanded with a full-fledged printing plant. Subsequently, in 1962, printing plant was moved from Galle to Colombo (Vauxhall St. Colombo 02 premises, where current Aitken Spence Group Headquarters is located) and ownership transferred to Aitken Spence &amp; Co.&lt;ref name="printbegin"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aitkenspenceplc.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/our-printing-heritage-2/|title= Our Printing Heritage |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galle2Colombo"&gt;{{cite news | title = Amherst, El Alamein and Aitken Spence | newspaper = Sunday Times| location = Colombo, Sri Lanka | url = http://www.sundaytimes.lk/030406/plus/6.html| accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aitken Spence Green Printing Facility.JPG|thumb|x225px|Aitken Spence Green Printing Facility]]
In 1977, whole printing department was burnt from a fire and its operations were halted. In 1982, a new printing plant was built at Bloemendhal Road, Colombo 13 to resume printing services.&lt;ref name="printbegin"/&gt; In 2010, due to capacity constraints, the company made a decision to relocate this printing plant yet again.&lt;ref name="printlocate"&gt;{{cite news | title = Aitken Spence Printing makes technology enhancements | newspaper = Sunday Times| location = Colombo, Sri Lanka | date = 24 October 2010 | url = http://www.sundaytimes.lk/101024/BusinessTimes/bt31.html| accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognizing the demand for environmentally friendly printing services, Aitken Spence invested US$7 million to construct Sri Lanka's first green printing facility at Mawaramandiya in Kelaniya. The new printing press commenced commercial operations in July 2012.&lt;ref name="greenfacility"&gt;{{cite news | title = Aitken Spence unveils country’s first green printing facility| newspaper = Daily Mirror| location = Colombo, Sri Lanka | date = 23 July 2012 | url = http://www.dailymirror.lk/business/other/20506-aitken-spence-unveils-countrys-first-green-printing-facility.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newfacility"&gt;{{cite news | title = Aitken Spence Printing Facility Opens| newspaper = Daily News| location = Colombo, Sri Lanka | date = 25 July 2012 | url = http://www.dailynews.lk/2012/07/25/bus100.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009''' ('''ACES''') was an [[energy]] bill in the [[111th United States Congress]] ({{USBill|111|H.R.|2454}}) that would have established a variant of an [[emissions trading]] plan similar to the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]]. The bill was approved by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on June 26, 2009 by a vote of 219-212, but was never brought to the floor of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] for discussion or a vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kate Sheppard |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/03/waxman-markey-senate-climate-kerry-graham-lieberman |title=Was Waxman-Markey A Waste of Energy? |publisher=Mother Jones |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walsh |first=Bryan |url=http://science.time.com/2010/07/26/why-the-climate-bill-died/ |title=Why the Climate Bill Died &amp;#124; TIME.com |publisher=Science.time.com |date=2010-07-26 |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;          
 
The House passage of the bill was the "first time either house of Congress had approved a bill meant to curb the heat-trapping gases scientists have linked to climate change."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

The bill was also known as the '''Waxman-Markey Bill''', after its authors, Representatives [[Henry Waxman|Henry A. Waxman]] of [[California]] and [[Ed Markey|Edward J. Markey]] of [[Massachusetts]], both [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Waxman was at the time the chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Energy and Commerce Committee]], and Markey was the chairman of that committee's [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power|Energy and Power Subcommittee]].

==Summary of provisions==
The bill proposed a [[cap and trade]] system, under which the government would set a limit (cap) on the total amount of [[greenhouse gas]]es that can be emitted nationally. Companies then buy or sell (trade) permits to emit these gases, primarily [[carbon dioxide]] {{CO2}}. The cap is reduced over time to reduce total carbon emissions. The legislation would set a cap on total emissions over the 2012–2050 period and would require regulated entities to hold rights, or allowances, to emit greenhouse gases. After allowances were initially distributed, entities would be free to buy and sell them (the trade part of the program). Those entities that emit more gases face a higher cost, which provides an economic incentive to reduce emissions. Key elements of the bill include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?q=bill/hr-2454-the-the-american-clean-energy-and-security-act]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Requires electric utilities to meet 20% of their electricity demand through renewable energy sources and energy efficiency by 2020.
*Subsidizes new clean energy technologies and energy efficiency, including renewable energy ($90 billion in new subsidies by 2025), carbon capture and sequestration ($60 billion), electric and other advanced technology vehicles ($20 billion), and basic scientific research and development ($20 billion).
*Protects consumers from energy price increases. According to estimates from the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], the reductions in carbon pollution required by the legislation will cost American families less than a postage stamp per day (about $13.20 a month, and $160.60 a year ). 
*It set the same target for reductions in emissions of [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], and other [[greenhouse gas]]es as that proposed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]. The bill required a 17-percent emissions reduction from 2005 levels by 2020; Obama has committed to a 17 percent reduction by 2020. Both plans would reduce United States' emissions by about 83 percent by 2050. Complementary measures in the legislation, such as efforts to prevent [[tropical deforestation]], will achieve significant additional reductions in carbon emissions.
*It included a [[renewable electricity standard]] (almost identical to a [[renewable portfolio standard]], but narrowly tailored to electrical energy) requiring each electricity provider who supplies over 4 million [[MWh]] to produce 20 percent of its [[electricity]] from [[Renewable resource|renewable sources]] (such as [[Wind power|wind]], [[Solar energy|solar]], and [[Geothermal power|geothermal]]) by 2020.  There is a provision whereby 5% of this standard can be met through [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] savings, as well as an additional 3% with certification of the [[Governor]] of the state in which the provider operates.

==Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis==
A study in June 2009 by the non-partisan [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) indicated that the bill would be roughly deficit-neutral for the government over the next decade:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/41189 |title=H.R. 2454, American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 &amp;#124; Congressional Budget Office |publisher=Cbo.gov |date=2009-06-05 |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...enacting the legislation would increase revenues by $873 billion over the 2010-2019 period and would increase direct spending by $864 billion over that 10-year period. In total, CBO and JCT estimate that enacting the legislation would reduce future budget deficits by about $4 billion over the 2010-2014 period and by about $9 billion over the 2010-2019 period...}}

The study also indicated that the tax burden on individual households would be limited:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_111/20090620/cbowaxmanmarkey.pdf |title=CBO-Analysis of Waxman-Markey-June 2009 |access-date=2009-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920091154/http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_111/20090620/cbowaxmanmarkey.pdf |archive-date=2009-09-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...the net annual economy-wide cost of the cap-and-trade program in 2020 would be $22 billion—or about $175 per household...households in the lowest income quintile would see an average net benefit of about $40 in 2020, while households in the highest income quintile would see a net cost of $245. Added costs for households in the second lowest quintile would be about $40 that year; in the middle quintile, about $235; and in the fourth quintile, about $340. Overall net costs would average 0.2 percent of households' after-tax income.}}

The analysis did not attempt to quantify the environmental benefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The report also stated that the "net financial impact of the program on households in different income brackets would depend in large part on how many allowances were sold (versus given away), how the free allowances were allocated, and how any proceeds from selling allowances were used. That net impact would reflect both the added costs that households experienced because of higher prices and the share of the allowance value that they received in the form of benefit payments, rebates, tax decreases or credits, wages, and returns on their investments." In other words, while a cap and trade system imposes costs on high emitters, it can generate revenues for low emitters that sell permits to them. While the government sets the bar on emission levels, the market determines who gains and who loses.

Today, the House looked to the future and did the right thing for our economy, security, and environment."&lt;ref name="REP626"/&gt;

The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) estimated the discussion draft version of the bill to cost average households $98–$140 per year.  A preliminary update of this study says that the changes "would likely result in lower allowance prices, a smaller impact on energy bills, and a smaller impact on household consumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/05/19/19greenwire-revised-house-climate-bill-carries-smaller-pri-19116.html | title=Revised House climate bill carries smaller price tag, EPA report says | date=2009-05-19 | work=The New York Times| accessdate=2009-05-20 | first1=Darren | last1=Samuelsohn| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090523193805/http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/05/19/19greenwire-revised-house-climate-bill-carries-smaller-pri-19116.html| archivedate= 23 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] argued for the bill in September 2009, while attacking the bill's opponents: "It's important, then, to understand that claims of immense economic damage from climate legislation are as bogus, in their own way, as [[climate change denial]]. Saving the planet won't come free (although the early stages of conservation actually might). But it won't cost all that much either."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/opinion/25krugman.html?ref=todayspaper|title=Opinion - It’s Easy Being Green|first=Paul|last=Krugman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During May 2009, he argued that a cap and trade system is better than a carbon tax. He explained how the incentives work

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even when polluters get free permits, they still have an incentive to reduce their emissions, so that they can sell their excess permits to someone else. That's not just theory: allowances for sulfur dioxide emissions are allocated to electric utilities free of charge, yet the cap-and-trade system for SO2 has been highly successful at controlling acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/18/opinion/18krugman.html|title=Opinion - The Perfect, the Good, the Planet|first=Paul|last=Krugman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Tia Nelson]] testified in support of the bill on April 24, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4533986/tia-nelson-supports-american-clean-energy-security-act-2009|title=Tia Nelson Supports American Clean Energy Security Act of 2009|website=C-SPAN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments against the bill===
Criticism has focused on ultimate costs and benefits of the plan.  A report written for the conservative think tank [[The Heritage Foundation]] on the discussion draft of the bill claims that the economy would react to this cap-and-trade system like it would lead to an energy crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/EnergyandEnvironment/wm2438.cfm | title=The Economic Impacts of Waxman-Markey | date=2009-05-13 | publisher=The [[Heritage Foundation]] | accessdate=2009-05-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090513230033/http://www.heritage.org/Research/EnergyandEnvironment/wm2438.cfm| archivedate= 13 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same report also claimed that the impact on global temperature by the end of the 21st century would amount to a reduction of no more than 0.2° [[Celsius]].

====Equity issues====
Economist [[Arnold Kling]] said the bill "maximizes rent-seeking (favoritism toward particular businesses) and minimizes carbon reduction".&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/06/the_obama_pattern.php The Obama Pattern], ''[[The Atlantic]]'', June 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Other economists have argued that the bill will create significant financial costs. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' accused the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) of significantly underestimating the bill's ultimate costs, pointing out supposed flaws in its calculations. The ''Wall Street Journal'' also suggested that the bill's costs would disproportionately affect lower-income households, for which the CBO estimates did not account.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124588837560750781 The Cap and Tax Fiction], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', June 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the bill's provisions to levy tariffs on Chinese imports due to carbon emissions could provoke a trade war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2009/06/24/24climatewire-possible-plan-for-tariffs-on-imports-from-ch-25103.html Possible Plan for Tariffs on Imports From China Remains Alive in House Climate Bill], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] argued that the bill was essentially the "largest tax hike in world history".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/06252009/postopinion/opedcolumnists/trojan_hearse_175976.htm Trojan Hearse], ''[[The New York Post]]'', June 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Petroleum Institute]], which represents the petroleum and natural gas industry, said the bill would place "disproportionate burden on all consumers of gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, jet fuel, propane and other petroleum products", and by 2035, it would cause gasoline prices in excess of $4.00 per gallon by today's standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.api.org/Newsroom/upload/Letter_to_Congress_6_23_09.pdf Letter to Congress], American Petroleum Institute, June 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nuclear power====
Nuclear power plants generate minimal greenhouse gases, yet one critic wrote that the bill does not sufficiently advocate this clean power source. In response to this criticism, House of Representatives staff members wrote that the electricity generated by nuclear power requires the purchase of far fewer allowances than other forms of electricity generation; that the bill provides various types of financial support to build clean energy generating sources, including nuclear; and that an EPA study indicated that twice as many nuclear plants would be built if the law is passed versus the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-kirsch/waxman-markey-three-tough_b_215430.html|title=Waxman-Markey: Three Tough, Unanswered Questions|first=Steve|last=Kirsch|date=16 July 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other high emitting nations====
There is criticism that unless [[China]] and [[India]] adopt similar emissions standards, the impact on global climate will be insubstantial.  This is largely an argument based on the leading role these two countries have obtained in carbon dioxide emissions which could reach 34% of the global total by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/pdf/emissions.pdf|title=International Energy Outlook, Chapter 7|date=June 2008|publisher=Energy Information Administration|accessdate=2009-05-20| archiveurl= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090427071944/http%3A//www%2Eeia%2Edoe%2Egov/oiaf/ieo/pdf/emissions%2Epdf| archivedate= April 27, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Doubts about a carbon market====
Critics also note that the bill would create the largest market in carbon in the world.  It would also "open up the so-called 'sub-prime carbon' market in [[carbon offset]]s, whereby industries can claim emissions reductions by investing in various projects around the world that theoretically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) claims it's virtually impossible to verify whether carbon offsets represent real emissions reductions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ips-dc.org/articles/good_news_theres_a_climate_bill_bad_news_it_stinks Good News, There's a Climate Bill — Bad News, It Stinks], [http://www.ips-dc.org/ The Institute for Policy Studies], May 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; "

====Non federal jurisdictions====
On June 26, 2009, [[Reuters]] reported that "[s]tates that have set the U.S. agenda on addressing greenhouse gas emissions are lining up behind a federal climate bill, fearing signs of dissent would weaken a plan that still faces hurdles"&lt;ref name=gardner&gt;{{cite news

===Debate among environmental organizations and scientists===
While the [[Environmental Defense Fund]]&lt;ref name="EDF9854"/&gt; and many other environmental organizations strongly support the bill, other environmentalists have sharply criticized the legislation in its present form as too weak and have called urgently for it to be amended so as to include additional and more vigorous measures to protect climate and natural resources.

Some environmentalists have criticized the fuel efficiency standards in the "cash for clunkers" provision of the bill, because new cars would only need to get 22 MPG to be considered fuel efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/congress-close-on-cash-for-clunkers/?hp | title=Congress Close on 'Cash for Clunkers' | work=The New York Times | date=May 6, 2009 | first=Ken | last=Belson | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://washingtonindependent.com/43628/dems-finally-stop-pretending-cash-for-clunkers-is-an-environmental-bill | title=Dems Finally Stop Pretending Cash-for-Clunkers Is an Environmental Bill | work=[[Washington Independent]] | date=May 19, 2009 | access-date=2009-06-01 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523221043/http://washingtonindependent.com/43628/dems-finally-stop-pretending-cash-for-clunkers-is-an-environmental-bill | archive-date=2009-05-23 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; New SUVs and pickup trucks would only need to get 18 MPG to be considered fuel efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE5515YB20090602?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews | title= Senate set to consider plan to boost auto sales | work=Reuters | date= June 2, 2009 | first=John | last=Crawley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicles older than 25 years are not eligible for the program.

''[[The New York Times]]'' has noted that "while some environmentalists enthusiastically supported the legislation, others, including [[Greenpeace]] and [[Friends of the Earth]], opposed it."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;  Friends of the Earth, an international environmental organization, announced its opposition to ACES as they believed the bill was too weak. They cited support from [[Shell Oil Company]] and [[Duke Energy]] as evidence of the bill's shortcomings. They also objected to the removal of the EPA's existing authority to use the Clean Air Act to counter emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A coalition of environmental groups released a statement saying that "to craft a bill that allows for 2 billion tons of offsets per year — roughly equivalent to 27 percent of 2007 U.S. greenhouse gas emissions — is to allow for continued and dangerous delay in real action by our country at a time when the world is looking to the U.S. for leadership on climate change."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redd-monitor.org/2009/04/24/environmental-groups-urge-waxmanmarkey-to-close-the-floodgate-on-carbon-offsets redd-monitor.org]{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the bill were concerned about it not going far enough, and claimed that there were too many concessions made to special interests in rewriting the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Dr. [[James E. Hansen]], one of the first to warn about the risks of climate change and an advocate of taking related action, also argued strongly against the bill: 1) It restricted the EPA's ability to regulate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from power plants; 2) it set "meager" targets for emission reductions, with only a 13% reduction by 2020; 3) it lacked certain controls important to the trading of allowances to emit carbon; and 4) it failed to set predictable prices for carbon, making it harder for businesses and households to make investment decisions. Dr. Hansen advocated a carbon tax rather than a cap and trade system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Alternatively, Senators Maria Cantwell and Susan Collins introduced the [[Carbon Limits and Energy for America's Renewal (CLEAR) Act]]. This bill proposed a [[Cap and Dividend]] approach in which 75% of the revenue is returned to taxpayers in the form of a dividend, and the rest is used to fund to development of renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Media response ===
News agencies [[Reuters]] and [[Agence France-Presse]] and [[United Kingdom]] newspaper [[The Guardian]] reported the narrow passage of the "historic"&lt;ref name=afphistoric&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iqcr7nMnCiZYVHW_iQ1hbxHWuIBQ|title=AFP: US House passes historic climate change bill:|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian27&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldenberg|first=Suzanne|title=Barack Obama's US climate change bill passes key Congress vote|publisher=The Guardian|date=2009-06-27|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/27/barack-obama-climate-change-bill|accessdate=2009-07-07 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090630040118/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jun/27/barack-obama-climate-change-bill| archivedate= 30 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; legislation in the House, regarding the vote to be a "major"&lt;ref name=afphistoric/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE55O4R120090626 House passes landmark climate change bill], Reuters&lt;/ref&gt; and "hard-fought"&lt;ref name=afphistoric/&gt; victory for President Obama, while an [[Associated Press]] article, carried by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], reported the vote to be "a triumph for [the] U.S. President."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/06/26/energy-bill.html U.S. House passes climate change bill], Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The New York Times]] commented that "the House legislation reflects a series of concessions necessary to attract the support of Democrats from different regions and with different ideologies. In the months of horse-trading before the vote Friday, the bill's targets for emissions of heat-trapping gases were weakened, its mandate for renewable electricity was scaled back, and incentives for industries were sweetened."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;  [[Business Week]] emphasized its perceived significance of the legislation and its passage in the House, declaring "June 26, 2009, will go down as an historic moment in world's efforts to tackle climate change. For the first time, a Congressional body passed legislation that would place mandatory limits on the emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/blogs/money_politics/archives/2009/06/house_passes_ca.html|title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?|website=www.businessweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on Copenhagen Climate Change Conference==
It was reported that the passage of ACES in Congress would increase the likelihood that a successor to the [[Kyoto Protocol]] would be adopted at the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009]] in [[Copenhagen]]. The Guardian US environment correspondent noted that ACES passing the US House of Representatives "delivers an important boost to the prospects of reaching an agreement for international action on climate change at Copenhagen this year."&lt;ref name=Guardian27/&gt; The NYTimes noted that "the German chancellor, [[Angela Merkel]], who was in Washington on Friday to meet with Mr. Obama, strongly endorsed the bill even though it fell short of European goals for reducing the emissions of heat-trapping gases."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

==Legislative history==
It was offered as a "discussion draft" in the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] on March 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1560&amp;Itemid=1|title=Chairmen Waxman, Markey Release Discussion Draft of New Clean Energy Legislation|date=2009-03-31|publisher=Committee on Energy and Commerce|accessdate=2009-04-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090403131728/http://energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1560&amp;Itemid=1| archivedate= 3 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final version of the legislation was introduced on May 15, 2009 by the same title, assigned bill number {{USBill|111|HR|2454}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1622:chairmen-waxman-and-markey-introduce-the-american-clean-energy-and-security-act&amp;catid=155:statements&amp;Itemid=55 |title=Chairmen Waxman and Markey Introduce "The American Clean Energy and Security Act" |date=2009-05-15 |publisher=Committee on Energy and Commerce |accessdate=2009-05-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525083534/http://energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1622%3Achairmen-waxman-and-markey-introduce-the-american-clean-energy-and-security-act&amp;catid=155%3Astatements&amp;Itemid=55 |archivedate=25 May 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 2009, the bill passed out of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Energy and Commerce Committee]] by a vote of 33-25, largely falling along political party lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee on Energy and Commerce - 111th Congress Roll Call Vote #68|url=http://republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/Media/file/Markups/Energy/ACES0509/FinalPassage.pdf|access-date=2012-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527212422/http://republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/Media/file/Markups/Energy/ACES0509/FinalPassage.pdf|archive-date=2010-05-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy and Commerce Committee markup ===
Republicans proposed over 400 amendments to the bill, the majority of which many think were proposed to delay passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20602099&amp;sid=aCOW1G1GFgAQ&amp;refer=energy|title=Waxman Seeks Bipartisan Help in Passing Climate Bill|date=2009-05-18|publisher=[[Bloomberg.com]]|accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more prominent from both parties are listed below:

==== Accepted ====
*[[John Dingell]] (D-MI) offered an amendment that establishes a bank to assist with loans for clean energy development.
*[[Betty Sutton]] (D-OH) offered an amendment establishing a "Cash for Clunkers" program, giving $3,500 or $4,500 toward the purchase or lease of more fuel efficient vehicles if anyone trades in qualifying, less-efficient vehicles.
*[[Kathy Castor]] (D-FL) offered an amendment giving states the ability to adopt [[feed-in tariff]]s for renewable energy as defined in the bill.
*[[Henry Waxman]] (D-CA) offered an amendment creating a classification of "central procurement state" that allows existing renewable energy legislation passed by states before January 1, 2009 to supersede some provisions of the bill.

==== Defeated ====
*[[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]] (R-MI) offered an amendment that would have cancelled the Act unless [[China]] and [[India]] adopt similar standards.
*[[Roy Blunt]] (R-MO) offered an amendment that would have cancelled the Act if the average price of electricity in a residential sector increases by 10% or more.  After defeat, he offered a second amendment that would have cancelled only Title III (the cap-and-trade plan) of the Act if residential electricity prices rise by 20%.  After defeat of this measure, [[George Radanovich]] (R-CA) offered a similar amendment that would have cancelled only Title III if electricity prices in the residential sector rise by 100%.  This measure was also defeated.  In the hearing, [[Bart Stupak]] (D-MI) called into question the seriousness of these "message amendments."  He stated they are only offered to be used by the Republicans to spur sensational headlines about lack of sympathy by Democrats.  Ranking Member [[Joe Barton]] (R-TX) responded that they were indeed "message amendments" to the American people in an attempt to convey that supporters of the bill care nothing about cost to the ratepayer.
*[[Lee Terry]] (R-NE) offered an amendment that would have cancelled the Act if average gas prices reach $5 per gallon.
*[[Fred Upton]] (R-MI) offered an amendment that would have suspended the Act if the nation's unemployment rate for the prior year reaches 15% as a result of the Act.
*[[Marsha Blackburn]] (R-TN) offered an amendment that would have required the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to label energy bills, food, manufactured products and fuels with the price impact this law has on the item.
*[[Cliff Stearns]] (R-FL) offered an amendment that would have removed existing nuclear power from the baseline of the Renewable Electricity Standard.  (This amendment would have potentially reduced the overall implementation of renewable energy under this act by around 20%, the amount of nuclear electricity generation in the United States).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nei.org/resourcesandstats/documentlibrary/reliableandaffordableenergy/graphicsandcharts/uselectricitygenerationfuelshares | title=U.S. Electricity Generation Fuel Shares | date=April 2009 | publisher=Nuclear Energy Institute | accessdate=2009-05-21 | archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090709005458/http://www.nei.org/resourcesandstats/documentlibrary/reliableandaffordableenergy/graphicsandcharts/uselectricitygenerationfuelshares/ | archive-date=2009-07-09 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of May 20, 2009, 2 Republican and 24 Democratic amendments had been adopted.  15 Republican amendments had been defeated.  No amendment sponsored by a Democrat had yet been defeated.

===Rules Committee resolution===
At 3:47 AM on June 26, 2009, {{USBill|111|HRes|587}} was reported to the house,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR02454:@@@S|title=House actions on H.R. 2454}}&lt;/ref&gt; which amended H.R. 2454, adding to the bill. This resolution was passed in the house just hours later at 11:21 AM. Republicans complained that neither the public nor the Representatives were given adequate time to study the 310-page amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=567bcb03-802a-23ad-43b2-c9ad4c60bf02|title=EPW Republicans to Majority: American Public Deserves to Know What Is In the Global Warming Bill|date=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Markey refuted [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s assertion that the bill was not available at all, saying the bill was available to read on the Internet and at the reading clerk's desk since the 3:47 AM reporting.&lt;ref name="politifact"&gt;{{cite web | author=Richert, Catharine | url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/09/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-claims-climate-bill-wasnt-written-when-it | title=Limbaugh claims the climate bill wasn't written when it came up for a vote | work=[[PolitiFact.com]], ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''. | accessdate= June 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final debate and floor vote===
Speaker Nancy Pelosi scheduled the vote for June 26, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/24068.html | title=Nancy Pelosi to bring climate change bill to floor | last=O'Connor | first=Patrick | date=June 23, 2009 | publisher=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] | accessdate=2009-07-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090626043329/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/24068.html| archivedate= 26 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The week leading up to the vote was marked by courting moderate Republicans and on-the-fence Democrats from rural and coal districts to support the legislation in what was expected to be a close vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/24232.html|title=  House passes climate-change bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the vote, Democrats were still working to ensure they had the votes needed to pass the bill.  Republicans tried to pull back their proposed amendments, realizing they were giving the Democrats more time to corral votes, however, they were unable to pull their proposed amendments off the floor.&lt;ref name=" House passes climate-change bill "&gt;House passes climate-change bill&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly before the vote, [[John Boehner]] read aloud to the House from most of the 300 page Manager's amendment that was filed at 3:09AM on the day of the vote.&lt;ref name=cqpolitics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docid%3Dnews-000003154783 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629052923/http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docid=news-000003154783 |archivedate=2009-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2009/06/26/house_gop_leader_boehner_filibusters_cap-and-trade_bill.html |title= |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=realclearpolitics.com |publisher=[[RealClearPolitics]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He voiced opposition to the practice of changing bills in the middle of the night before the vote, and concern that the Manager's amendment made substantial changes to the bill.  He did not want the House to vote on the bill before the members could learn what was in the amendment, so he read much of it aloud.  Manager's amendments are supposed to be for clerical changes only, not substantive ones.  [[Patrick J. Kennedy]] (D-RI) returned from rehab to cast a 'Yes' vote, and [[Ellen Tauscher]] (D-CA) delayed resigning the House to vote for the legislation as well.&lt;ref name=cqpolitics/&gt;

The bill was approved in the House by a vote of 219-212, with 8 Republicans supporting, and 44 Democrats voting against, and 3 members not voting.&lt;ref name="House vote"&gt;{{USHRollCall|2009|477}}l&lt;/ref&gt;  All Representatives present at the time of the vote had cast votes.  [[Jeff Flake]] (R-AZ), [[Alcee Hastings]] (D-FL), and [[John A. Sullivan|John Sullivan]] (R-OK) missed the vote due to 'a family conflict,' travel abroad in Albania, and 'alcohol addiction treatment,' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/rep.-kennedy-returns-for-climate-vote-2009-06-26.html |title=News Archive |publisher=TheHill |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic votes against largely came from freshmen in Republican-leaning seats, conservative [[Blue Dog Coalition|"blue dog" democrats]], as well as Democrats from areas dependent on coal for electricity or areas with large numbers of manufacturing jobs.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name="House vote"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swingstateproject.com/ |title=Swing State Project – Campaign and Election News – Covering Key Races Around the Country |publisher=Swingstateproject.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some Democrats from liberal districts, like  [[Pete Stark]] (CA) voted against the bill because he considered the bill 'watered-down.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stark.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1299&amp;Itemid=62 |title=The Online Office of Congressman Pete Stark - STATEMENT OPPOSING WATERED-DOWN GLOBAL WARMING LEGISLATION: |access-date=2009-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701032928/http://www.stark.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1299&amp;Itemid=62 |archive-date=2009-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis Kucinich]] (D-OH) voted against the bill because he considered the bill 'too-weak' and opposed offsets, among other similar criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clevelandleader.com/node/10478 Dennis Kucinich Lays Out Why He Voted Against Clean Energy Act], Cleveland Leader&lt;/ref&gt;

Republicans supporting the bill were [[Army Secretary]] nominee [[John M.

[[Image:Antiferromagnetic ordering.svg|thumb|Antiferromagnetic ordering]]
In materials that exhibit '''antiferromagnetism''', the [[magnetic moment]]s of [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s, usually
related to the spins of [[electron]]s, align in a regular pattern with neighboring [[spin (physics)|spins]] (on different sublattices) pointing in opposite directions. This is, like [[ferromagnetism]] and [[ferrimagnetism]], a manifestation of ordered [[magnetism]].

Generally, antiferromagnetic order may exist at sufficiently low temperatures, but vanishes at and above the [[Néel temperature]] – named after [[Louis Néel]], who had first identified this type of magnetic ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=M. Louis Néel|title=Propriétées magnétiques des ferrites; Férrimagnétisme et antiferromagnétisme|journal=[[Annales de Physique]]|volume=12|issue=3|page=137–198|year=1948|doi=10.1051/anphys/194812030137|bibcode=1948AnPh...12..137N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above the Néel temperature, the material is typically [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]].

== Measurement ==
When no external field is applied, the antiferromagnetic structure corresponds to a vanishing total magnetization. In an external magnetic field, a kind of [[ferrimagnetic]] behavior may be displayed in the antiferromagnetic phase, with the absolute value of one of the sublattice magnetizations differing from that of the other sublattice, resulting in a nonzero net magnetization. Although the net magnetization should be zero at a temperature of [[absolute zero]], the effect of [[spin canting]] often causes a small net magnetization to develop, as seen for example in [[hematite]].

The [[magnetic susceptibility]] of an antiferromagnetic material typically shows a maximum at the Néel temperature. In contrast, at the transition between the [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] to the [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] phases the susceptibility will diverge. In the antiferromagnetic case, a divergence is observed in the ''staggered susceptibility''.

Various microscopic (exchange) interactions between the magnetic moments or spins may lead to antiferromagnetic structures. In the simplest case, one may consider an [[Ising model]] on a [[:wikt:bipartite|bipartite]] lattice, e.g. the simple [[cubic crystal system|cubic lattice]], with couplings between spins at nearest neighbor sites. Depending on the sign of that interaction, [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] or antiferromagnetic order will result. [[Geometrical frustration]] or [[ANNNI model|competing]] ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions may lead to different and, perhaps, more complicated magnetic structures.

== Antiferromagnetic materials ==
Antiferromagnetic materials occur commonly among [[transition metal]] compounds, especially oxides. Examples include [[hematite]], metals such as [[chromium]], alloys such as iron manganese (FeMn), and oxides such as nickel oxide (NiO). There are also numerous examples among high nuclearity metal clusters. Organic molecules can also exhibit antiferromagnetic coupling under rare circumstances, as seen in radicals such as [[5-dehydro-m-xylylene]].

Antiferromagnets can couple to [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]], for instance, through a mechanism known as [[exchange bias]], in which the [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] film is either grown upon the antiferromagnet or annealed in an aligning magnetic field, causing the surface atoms of the [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnet]] to align with the surface atoms of the antiferromagnet. This provides the ability to "pin" the orientation of a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] film, which provides one of the main uses in so-called [[spin valves]], which are the basis of magnetic sensors including modern [[hard drive]] read heads. The temperature at or above which an antiferromagnetic layer loses its ability to "pin" the magnetization direction of an adjacent ferromagnetic layer is called the blocking temperature of that layer and is usually lower than the Néel temperature.

==Geometric frustration==

{{Main article|Geometrical frustration}}

Unlike ferromagnetism, anti-ferromagnetic interactions can lead to multiple optimal states (ground states—states of minimal energy). In one dimension, the anti-ferromagnetic ground state is an alternating series of spins: up, down, up, down, etc. Yet in two dimensions, multiple ground states can occur.

Consider an equilateral triangle with three spins, one on each vertex. If each spin can take on only two values (up or down), there are 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8 possible states of the system, six of which are ground states. The two situations which are not ground states are when all three spins are up or are all down. In any of the other six states, there will be two favorable interactions and one unfavorable one. This illustrates [[Geometrically frustrated magnet|frustration]]: the inability of the system to find a single ground state. This type of magnetic behavior has been found in minerals that have a crystal stacking structure such as a [[Kagome lattice]] or [[hexagonal lattice]].

== Other properties ==

Synthetic antiferromagnets (often abbreviated by SAF) are artificial antiferromagnets consisting of two or more thin ferromagnetic layers separated by a nonmagnetic layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=M. Forrester and F. Kusmartsev|title=The nano-mechanics and magnetic properties of high moment synthetic antiferromagnetic particles|journal=[[Physica Status Solidi A]]|volume=211|issue=4|pages=884–889|year=2014|doi=10.1002/pssa.201330122|bibcode=2014PSSAR.211..884F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dipole coupling of the ferromagnetic layers results in antiparallel alignment of the magnetization of the ferromagnets.

Antiferromagnetism plays a crucial role in [[giant magnetoresistance]], as had been discovered in 1988 by the [[Nobel prize]] winners [[Albert Fert]] and [[Peter Grünberg]] (awarded in 2007) using synthetic antiferromagnets.

There are also examples of disordered materials (such as iron phosphate glasses) that become antiferromagnetic below their Néel temperature. These disordered networks 'frustrate' the antiparallelism of adjacent spins; i.e. it is not possible to construct a network where each spin is surrounded by opposite neighbour spins. It can only be determined that the average correlation of neighbour spins is antiferromagnetic. This type of magnetism is sometimes called ''speromagnetism''.

An interesting phenomenon occurs in [[anisotropic]] [[Heisenberg]] antiferromagnets in a field,
where spin-flop and [[supersolid]] phases may be stabilized.
The latter phase has been described first by [[Takeo Matsubara]] and H. Matsuda in 1956.

The real value of the arrátel fluctuated during the [[Middle Ages]]. Before king [[Pedro I of Portugal|Pedro I]], the main arrátel seems to have been an arrátel of 12.5 [[ounce]]s. With Pedro I, the official arrátel increased to 14 ounces. Finally, the Portuguese arrátel was fixed at 16 ounces by decree of King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] in 1499. This arrátel, which was kept as the national standard until the introduction of the metric system, was similar to the Spanish [[pound (mass)|libra]].

[[Image:Spin—an aggravated stall and autorotation..JPG|thumb|100px|Spin — an aggravated stall and autorotation]]

For [[fixed-wing aircraft]], '''autorotation''' is the tendency of an aircraft in or near a [[Stall (flight)|stall]] to roll spontaneously to the right or left, leading to a [[Spin (flight)|spin]] (a state of continuous autorotation).&lt;ref name=Clancy16.48&amp;49&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Sections 16.48 and 16.49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stinton, Darryl, ''Flying Qualities and Flight Testing of The Aeroplane'', Chapter 5 (p.503)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autorotation in fixed-wing aircraft==
[[Image:Aerodynamic spin diagram.png|thumb|A typical graph of lift coefficient and drag coefficient versus angle of attack.  At any angle of attack greater than the stalling angle an increase in angle of attack causes a reduction in lift coefficient, and a decrease in angle of attack causes an increase in lift coefficient.]]
When the [[angle of attack]] is less than the [[Stall (flight)|stalling]] angle, any increase in angle of attack causes an increase in [[lift coefficient]] that causes the wing to rise.  As the wing rises the angle of attack and lift coefficient decrease which tend to restore the wing to its original angle of attack. Conversely any decrease in angle of attack causes a decrease in lift coefficient which causes the wing to descend. As the wing descends, the angle of attack and lift coefficient increase which tends to restore the wing to its original angle of attack. For this reason the angle of attack is stable when it is less than the stalling angle.&lt;ref name=Clancy16.48&amp;49/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stinton&gt;Stinton, Darryl, ''Flying Qualities and Flight Testing of The Aeroplane'', Chapter 12 (p.517)&lt;/ref&gt;  The aircraft displays damping in roll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

When the wing is stalled and the angle of attack is greater than the stalling angle, any increase in angle of attack causes a decrease in lift coefficient that causes the wing to descend. As the wing descends the angle of attack increases, which causes the lift coefficient to decrease and the angle of attack to increase. Conversely any decrease in angle of attack causes an increase in lift coefficient that causes the wing to rise. As the wing rises the angle of attack decreases and causes the lift coefficient to increase further towards the maximum lift coefficient.  For this reason the angle of attack is unstable when it is greater than the stalling angle. Any disturbance of the angle of attack on one wing will cause the whole wing to roll spontaneously and continuously. &lt;ref name=Clancy16.48&amp;49/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stinton/&gt;

When the angle of attack on the wing of an aircraft reaches the stalling angle the aircraft is at risk of autorotation. This will eventually develop into a [[Spin (flight)|spin]] if the pilot does not take corrective action.

== Autorotation in kites and gliders ==
# [[Magnus effect]] rotating kites (wing flipping or wing tumbling) that have the rotation axis bluntly normal to the stream direction use autorotation; a net lift is possible that lifts the kite and payload to altitude. The Rotoplane, the UFO rotating kite, and the Skybow rotating ribbon arch kite use the Magnus effect resulting from the autorotating wing with rotation axis normal to the stream.&lt;ref name="skylark"&gt;[http://www.blueskylark.org/zoo/single/rot/index.html Rotating Kites]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some kites are equipped with autorotation wings.&lt;ref name="skylark" /&gt; 
# Again, a third kind of autorotation occurs in self-rotating bols, rotating parachutes, or rotating helical objects sometimes used as kite tails or kite-line laundry. This kind of autorotation drives wind and water propeller-type turbines, sometimes used to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energykitesystems.net/KiteLab/index.html KiteLab]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magenn.com/ Magenn Power, Inc.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211041521/http://www.magenn.com/ |date=2008-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Unlocked engine-off aircraft propellers may autorotate. Such autorotation is being explored for generating electricity to recharge flight-driving batteries.&lt;ref&gt;''Regenerative Battery-Augmented Soaring'' Paul B. MacCready [https://web.archive.org/web/20050829003554/http://esoaring.com/back_issues_sailplane_builder.htm Sailplane Homebuilders Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Autorotation in airborne wind energy (AWE) technology ==
Autorotation is the basis of a large sector of airborne wind energy (AWE) technology.  [[High altitude wind power]] research and development centers frequently are dependent on blade autorotation: [http://www.skymillenergy.com SkyMill Energy],[https://web.archive.org/web/20170420162849/http://jobyenergy.com/ Joby Energy],[http://www.skywindpower.com/ww/index.htm Sky Windpower], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110202150743/https://baseloadenergy.com/ BaseLoad Energy], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100103175049/http://magenn.com/ Magenn Power], and [http://www.makanipower.com/ Makani Power] are making and testing airborne wind energy conversion systems (AWECS) that employ autorotation of blades to drive the shafts of generators to make electricity at altitude and send the electricity to earth via conductive tethers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energykitesystems.net/index.html Energykitesystems]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Big Oil.svg|thumb|right|Chart of the major [[energy]] companies dubbed "Big Oil" sorted by 2005 revenue]]

'''Big Oil''' is a name used to describe the world's six or seven largest [[List of corporations by market capitalization#Publicly traded companies|publicly traded]] [[list of oil companies|oil and gas companies]], also known as '''supermajors'''.&lt;ref name=reut1808&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/08/01/us-oilmajors-production-idUSL169721220080801|title=Oil majors' output growth hinges on strategy shift|accessdate=28 April 2011|publisher=Reuters|date=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt2206&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/02/business/worldbusiness/02iht-shell.html|title=Shell will invest despite decline in earnings|accessdate=28 April 2011|publisher=The New York Times|date=2 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bw29906&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-12-11/conocophillips-the-making-of-an-oil-major|accessdate=2016-04-01|title=ConocoPhillips: The Making Of An Oil Major|date=12 December 2005|work=Business Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nafta - Volume 56 - Page 447  2005 "Tom Nicholls, editor, Petroleum Economist, writes WHOEVER coined the term supermajor should have kept some superlatives in reserve.

The term, analogous to others, such as [[Big Steel]], that describe industries dominated by a few giant corporations, was popularized in print from the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Corporate Packaging Management C.

In the [[Merchant navy|maritime]] industry, six to seven large oil companies that decide a majority of the [[crude oil tanker]] [[Chartering (shipping)|chartering]] business are called '''"Oil Majors"'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TEN wins long-term suezmax charter with an oil major|url=http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/sector/tankers/article474631.ece|accessdate=6 December 2015|publisher=Lloyds List|date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of the supermajors traces back to the "[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]]", the seven oil companies which formed the "[[Consortium for Iran]]" cartel and dominated the global [[petroleum industry]] from the mid-1940s to the 1970s.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/471ae1b8-d001-11db-94cb-000b5df10621.html The new Seven Sisters: oil and gas giants dwarf western rivals], by Carola Hoyos, Financial Times. 11 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946053-1,00.html|title=Business: The Seven Sisters Still Rule|accessdate=24 October 2010|publisher=Time|date=11 September 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Seven Sisters were:
* [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (now [[BP]]);
* [[Gulf Oil]], [[Standard Oil of California|Standard Oil of California (Socal)]] and [[Texaco]] (now [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]);
* [[Royal Dutch Shell]]; and
* [[Standard Oil of New Jersey|Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso)]] and [[Standard Oil Company of New York|Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony)]] (now [[ExxonMobil]]).
Before the [[oil crisis of 1973]] the members of the Seven Sisters controlled around 85% of the world's [[oil reserves]].
The supermajors began to emerge in the late-1990s, in response to a severe fall in [[oil prices]]. Large petroleum companies began to merge, often in an effort to improve [[economies of scale]], hedge against oil [[volatility (finance)|price volatility]], and reduce large cash reserves through reinvestment.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

|title=Slick Deal?
|publisher=''[[NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]''
|date=1998-12-01
|accessdate=2007-08-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The following major mergers and acquisitions of oil and gas companies took place between 1998 and 2002:
* Exxon's merger with [[Mobil]] in 1999, forming ExxonMobil;
* Total's merger with [[Petrofina]] in 1999 and with [[Elf Aquitaine]] in 2000, with the resulting company subsequently renamed Total S.A.;
* BP's acquisitions of [[Amoco]] in 1998 and of [[ARCO]] in 2000;
* Chevron's acquisition of [[Texaco]] in 2001;
* the merger of [[Conoco Inc.]] and [[Phillips Petroleum Company]] in 2002, forming [[ConocoPhillips]].
This process of consolidation created some of the largest global corporations as defined by the [[Forbes Global 2000]] ranking, and as of 2007 all were within the top 25. Between 2004 and 2007 the profits of the six supermajors totaled US$494.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2008/ Global 500], ''Fortune'' website, accessed Aug. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
Trading under various names around the world, the supermajors are considered to be:&lt;ref name=reut1808/&gt;

* [[BP|BP plc]] ([[United Kingdom]])
* [[Chevron Corporation]] ([[United States]])
* [[Eni|Eni SpA]] ([[Italy]])
* [[ExxonMobil|ExxonMobil Corporation]] ([[United States]])
* [[Royal Dutch Shell|Royal Dutch Shell plc]] ([[Netherlands]] and [[United Kingdom]])
* [[Total SA]] ([[France]])

[[ConocoPhillips Company]] ([[United States]]) was also sometimes described as forming part of the group,&lt;ref name=bw29906/&gt; before the Downstream activities spin-off. As of 2011 ExxonMobil ranked first among the supermajors measured by market capitalization, cash flow and profits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Forbes Global 2000#2011 list|Forbes Global 2000 – 2011 list]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of corporations by market capitalization#Publicly traded companies|FT list of top Publicly Traded companies]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a group, the supermajors control around 6% of global [[Oil reserves|oil]] and [[Gas reserves|gas]] reserves. Conversely, 88% of global oil and gas reserves are controlled by the [[OPEC]] [[cartel]] and [[National oil company|state-owned oil companies]], primarily located in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="EIA"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Energy Information Administration | title=Who are the major players supplying the world oil market? | year=2009 | url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/energy_in_brief/world_oil_market.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trend of increasing influence of the OPEC cartel, state-owned oil companies&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/opinion/columnists/article272352.ece|title=Shaky industry that runs the world|accessdate=26 October 2010|publisher=The Times (South Africa)|date=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in emerging-market economies is shown and the ''[[Financial Times]]'' has used the label "[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)#The New Seven Sisters|The New Seven Sisters]]" to refer to a group of what it argues are the most influential national oil and gas companies based in countries outside of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], namely [[China National Petroleum Corporation|CNPC]] ''(China)'', [[Gazprom]] ''(Russia)'', [[National Iranian Oil Company]] ''(Iran)'', [[Petrobras]] ''(Brazil)'', [[Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.|PDVSA]] ''(Venezuela)'', [[Petronas]] ''(Malaysia)'', [[Saudi Aramco]] ''(Saudi Arabia)''.&lt;ref name="NSS-01"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ypenergy.org/history/ |title=New and Old Leaders in the Upstream Oil Industry |accessdate=20 Jan 2012 |publisher=ypenergy.org |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222183241/http://www.ypenergy.org/history/ |archivedate=22 December 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSS-02"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.warregoenergy.com/story/documents/FT%20The%20New%20Seven%20Sisters.pdf|title=FT – New and Old Leaders in the Upstream Oil Industry|accessdate=20 Jan 2012|publisher=FT|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Big oil"==
Petroleum and [[natural gas|gas]] supermajors are sometimes collectively referred to as "Big oil", a term that emphasizes their economic power and perceived influence on politics, particularly in the United States. Big oil is often associated with the [[fossil fuels lobby]].

Usually used to refer to the industry as a whole in a pejorative or derogatory manner, "Big oil" has come to encompass the enormous impact crude oil exerts over first-world industrial society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920328,00.html Inside the Big Oil Game] at Time&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maritime "Oil Majors"==
In the maritime industry, a group of six companies that control the chartering of the majority of oil tankers worldwide are together referred to as '''"Oil Majors"'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meaning of an ‘Oil major’ and ‘Recognised Oil Majors’|url=http://www.lawandsea.net/CP_Time/Charterparty_Time_Majors_Approval_2Meaning_of_Oil_major.html|website=www.lawandsea.net|publisher=Law and the sea|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are: [[Shell Oil|Royal Dutch Shell]], [[BP]], [[Exxon Mobil]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron Texaco]], [[Total Fina Elf]] and [[ConocoPhillips]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dolphin Tanker Srl v Westport Petroleum Inc (The Savina Caylyn) [2010] EWHC 2617 (Comm)|url=http://www.lawandsea.net|website=www.lawandsea.net|publisher=Law and sea|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Helman|first1=Christopher|title=The World's Biggest Oil And Gas Companies - 2015|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2015/03/19/the-worlds-biggest-oil-and-gas-companies/|accessdate=6 December 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charter-party|Charter parties]] such as "Shelltime 4" frequently mention the phrase "oil major".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McInnes|first1=David|title=Legal aspects of oil major approvals in oil tanker charter parties|url=http://www.lmaa.london|website=www.lmaa.london|publisher=Ince &amp; Co.|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breadfruit''' (''Artocarpus altilis'') is a species of [[Flowering plant|flowering]] [[tree]] in the [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] and [[jackfruit]] family ([[Moraceae]]) originating in the South Pacific and eventually spreading to the rest of [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name="morton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/breadfruit.html |first=Julia F |last=Morton |year=1987 |title=Breadfruit; In: Fruits of Warm Climates |pages=50–58 |publisher=NewCROP, the New Crop Resource Online Program, Center for New Crops and Plant Products, Department of Horticulture and Landscape  Architecture, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN |accessdate=17 January 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105073957/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/breadfruit.html |archivedate=5 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; British and French navigators introduced a few Polynesian seedless varieties to Caribbean islands during the late 18th century, and today it is grown in some 90 countries throughout South and Southeast Asia, the Pacific Ocean, the Caribbean, Central America and Africa.&lt;ref name="ntbg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntbg.org/breadfruit/about/species|title=Breadfruit Species |publisher=National Tropical Botanical Garden - Tropical Plant Research, Education, and Conservation |date=2017 |accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name is derived from the texture of the moderately ripe fruit when cooked, similar to freshly baked bread and having a potato-like flavor.&lt;ref name=ntbg/&gt;&lt;ref name=kew/&gt;

According to [[DNA fingerprinting]] studies, breadfruit has its origins in the region of [[Oceania]] from [[New Guinea]] through the [[Indo-Malayan Archipelago]] to western [[Micronesia]].&lt;ref name="zerega"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Zerega, N.

==History ==
Because breadfruit dispersal across Oceania was dependent on human [[seamanship|seafaring]], botanical research has correlated with the human colonization of Oceania, resulting in a theory that humans brought breadfruit seeds from [[Melanesia]] to settle in [[Polynesia]] and [[Micronesia]] over thousands of years.&lt;ref name=ntbg/&gt;&lt;ref name="kew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:582598-1|title=''Artocarpus altilis'' (breadfruit)|publisher=Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Gardens, Richmond, Surrey, UK|date=2017|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] and others saw the value of breadfruit as a highly productive food in 1769, when stationed in [[Tahiti]] as part of the {{HMS|Endeavour||2}} expedition commanded by [[Captain James Cook]].&lt;ref name=kew/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anne"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Kad7vgAACAAJ|page=190}}|title=Aphrodite's Island|last1=Salmond|first1=Anne|date=2010|publisher=University of California Press|year=|isbn=9780520261143|location=Berkeley|pages=190, 197, 307–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late-18th-century quest for cheap, high-energy food sources for [[slaves]] in British colonies prompted colonial administrators and plantation owners to call for the plant to be brought to the [[Caribbean]]. As president of the [[Royal Society]], Banks provided a cash bounty and gold medal for success in this endeavor, and successfully lobbied his friends in government and the Admiralty for a British Naval expedition. In 1787, [[William Bligh]] was appointed captain of {{HMS|Bounty}}, and ordered to proceed to the South Pacific to collect the plants. In 1791, Bligh commanded a second expedition with {{HMS|Providence|1791|2}} and {{HMS|Assistant||2}}, which collected [[seedless]] breadfruit plants in Tahiti and transported these to [[St. Helena]], in the Atlantic, and [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] and [[Jamaica]] in the West Indies.&lt;ref name=ntbg/&gt;&lt;ref name=kew/&gt; Although Bligh won the [[Royal Society]] medal for his efforts, the introduction was not entirely successful, as most slaves refused to eat the new food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=p0lB4qYDvGgC}}|title=Joseph Banks: A Life|last=O'Brian|first=Patrick|date=8 December 1997|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-61628-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[Image:Breadfruit Tree.jpg|left|thumb|A breadfruit tree in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii|alt=Breadfruit tree]]
Breadfruit trees grow to a height of {{convert|26|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; The large and thick [[Leaf|leaves]] are deeply cut into [[pinnate]] lobes. All parts of the tree yield [[latex]],&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; which is useful for boat [[caulking]].&lt;ref name=kew/&gt;

The trees are [[Plant sexuality|monoecious]], with male and female flowers growing on the same tree. The male [[flower]]s emerge first, followed shortly afterward by the female flowers. The latter grow into [[Head (botany)|capitula]], which are capable of [[pollination]] just three days later. Pollination occurs mainly by fruit bats, but cultivated varieties produce fruit without pollination.&lt;ref name=kew/&gt; The compound, false fruit develops from the swollen [[perianth]], and originates from 1,500-2,000 flowers visible on the skin of the fruit as hexagon-like disks.

Breadfruit is one of the highest-yielding food plants, with a single tree producing up to 200 or more grapefruit-sized fruits per season, requiring limited care. In the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], the trees yield 50 to 150 fruits per year, usually round, oval or oblong weighing 0.25&amp;ndash;6&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=ntbg/&gt; Productivity varies between wet and dry areas. Studies in [[Barbados]] indicate a reasonable potential of {{convert|16|-|32|ST/ha|ST/acre|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt;  The ovoid fruit has a rough surface, and each fruit is divided into many [[achene]]s, each achene surrounded by a fleshy [[perianth]] and growing on a fleshy [[receptacle (botany)|receptacle]]. Most selectively bred [[cultivar]]s have [[seedless fruit]], whereas seeded varieties are grown mainly for their edible seeds.&lt;ref name=kew/&gt; Breadfruit is usually propagated using [[root cutting]]s.&lt;ref name=ntbg/&gt;

Breadfruit is closely related to the [[Artocarpus camansi|breadnut]], from which it might have been naturally selected.&lt;ref name=ntbg/&gt; It is noticeably similar in appearance to its relative of the same [[genus]], the [[jackfruit]] (''[[Artocarpus heterophyllus]]'').

Breadfruit has hundreds of [[variety (botany)|varieties]] and thousands of common names varying according to its geographic distribution, and is cultivated in some 90 countries.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt;&lt;ref name=ntbg/&gt;

== Habitat ==
Breadfruit is an equatorial lowland species. It grows best below elevations of {{convert|650|m|ft}}, but is found at elevations of {{convert|1550|m|ft}}. Preferred soils are neutral to [[alkali]]ne ([[Soil pH|pH]] of 6.1&amp;ndash;7.4) and either sand, sandy loam, loam or sandy clay [[loam]]. Breadfruit is able to grow in [[coral sand]]s and [[Soil salinity|saline soils]]. The breadfruit is ultra-tropical, requiring a temperature range of {{convert|16|-|38|C}} and an annual rainfall of {{convert|200|-|250|cm|abbr=on|-1}}.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt;

===Food===
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2018}}
Breadfruit is a [[staple food]] in many tropical regions. Most breadfruit varieties produce fruits throughout the year. Both ripe and unripe fruits have culinary uses, but unripe breadfruit is cooked before consumption.&lt;ref name="janick"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=cjHCoMQNkcgC|page=476}}|title=The Encyclopedia of Fruit and Nuts|last1=Janick|first1=Jules|last2=Paull|first2=Robert E.|publisher=CABI|year=2008|isbn=978-0-85199-638-7|location=|pages=476}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before being eaten, the fruits are roasted, baked, fried or boiled. When cooked, the taste of moderately ripe breadfruit is described as [[potato]]-like, or similar to freshly baked bread.  

Because breadfruit trees usually produce large crops at certain times of the year, preservation of the harvested fruit is an issue. One traditional preservation technique is to bury peeled and washed fruits in a leaf-lined pit where they [[Fermentation (food)|ferment]] over several weeks and produce a sour, sticky paste. So stored, the product may last a year or more, and some pits are reported to have produced edible contents more than 20 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4SdXGwAACAAJ}}|title=Plants, People, and Culture: The Science of Ethnobotany|last1=Balick|first1=Michael J.|last2=Cox|first2=Paul Alan|publisher=Scientific American Library|year=1997|isbn=978-0-7167-6027-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermented breadfruit mash goes by many names such as ''mahr'', ''ma'', ''masi'', ''furo'', and ''bwiru'', among others.

Breadfruit can be eaten once cooked, or can be further processed into a variety of other foods. A common product is a mixture of cooked or fermented breadfruit mash mixed with [[coconut]] milk and baked in [[Banana leaf|banana leaves]]. Whole fruits can be cooked in an open fire, then cored and filled with other foods, such as coconut milk, sugar and butter, cooked meats, or other fruits. The filled fruit can be cooked further so the flavor of the filling permeates the flesh of the breadfruit.

====Asia and Pacific Islands====

Breadfruit is found in [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], where it is called ''sukun''. In Indonesia, fried breadfruit is sold by street food vendors, and is known as [[gorengan]]. In the South Indian state of [[Kerala]] and coastal [[Karnataka]], especially near [[Mangalore]], where it is widely grown and cooked, it is known as ''kada chakka''.

In [[Sri Lanka]], it is cooked as a curry using coconut milk and spices (which becomes a side dish) or boiled. Boiled breadfruit is a famous main meal. It is often consumed with scraped coconut or ''coconut sambol'', made of scraped coconut, red chilli powder and salt mixed with a dash of [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice. A traditional sweet snack made of finely sliced, sun-dried breadfruit chips deep-fried in coconut oil and dipped in heated treacle or sugar syrup is known as ''rata del petti''.&lt;ref&gt;Apé Lamā Lōkaya:1950, Chapter 31 (Vijitha Yapa Publications) {{ISBN|978-955-665-250-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]], [[Fritter|fritters]] of breadfruit, called ''jeev kadge phodi'' in [[Konkani]] or "kadachakka varuthath" in [[Malayalam]] are a local delicacy in coastal [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]]. In [[Seychelles]], it was traditionally eaten as a substitute for rice, as an accompaniment to the mains. It would either be consumed boiled (''friyapen bwi'') or grilled (''friyapen griye''), where it would be put whole in the wood fire used for cooking the main meal and then taken out when ready. It is also eaten as a dessert, called ''ladob friyapen'', where it is boiled in coconut milk, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and a pinch of salt.

In the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian]] staple food called ''[[poi (food)|poi]]'', the traditional ingredient of mashed [[taro]] root can be replaced by, or augmented with, mashed breadfruit. The resulting "breadfruit poi" is called ''poi {{okina}}ulu''.

====Caribbean====

In [[Belize]], the Mayan people call it ''masapan''. In [[Puerto Rico]], breadfruit is called ''panapen'' or ''pana'', for short. In some inland regions it is also called ''mapén''. ''Pana'' is often served boiled with a mixture of sauteed ''[[Dried and salted cod|bacalao]]'' (salted cod fish), olive oil and onions. It is also served as ''[[tostones]]'' or ''[[mofongo]]''. A popular dessert is also made with sweet ripe breadfruit: ''[[flan]] de pana'' (breadfruit custard). In the [[Dominican Republic]], it is known by the name ''buen pan'' or "good bread". In [[Barbados]], breadfruit is boiled with salted meat and mashed with butter to make breadfruit coucou. It is usually eaten with saucy meat dishes. In [[Jamaica]], breadfruit is boiled in soups or roasted on stove top, in the oven or on wood coal. It is usually eaten with the national dish ackee and salt fish. The ripe fruit is used in salads or fried as a side dish.

===Timber and other uses===

Breadfruit was widely used in a variety of ways among [[Pacific Islanders]]. Its lightweight wood ([[specific gravity]] of 0.27)&lt;ref name="CFTH"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/forestry/trees/CommonTreesHI/CFT_Artocarpus_altilis.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030071228/http://www2.ctahr.hawaii.edu/forestry/trees/CommonTreesHI/CFT_Artocarpus_altilis.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2014 |format=PDF |title=ʻUlu, breadfruit |first=Elbert L. |last=Little Jr. |author2=Roger G.

== In culture ==

On [[Puluwat]] in the [[Caroline Islands]], in the context of sacred ''yitang'' lore, breadfruit (''poi'') is a figure of speech for knowledge. This lore is organized into five categories: war, magic, meetings, navigation, and ''breadfruit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/Volume_80_1971/Volume_80%2C_No._2/The_Poi_of_the_meeting%2C_by_Saul_H._Riesenberg%2C_p_217_-_227/p1?page=0&amp;action=searchresult&amp;target=|title=The Poi of the Meeting|publisher=[[Journal of the Polynesian Society]], [[Auckland University]]|year=1971|first1=Saul H.|last1=Riesenberg |first2=Samuel H. |last2=Elbert|quote=''Kkónen'', although literally meaning pounded breadfruit, refers in these bowls of knowledge to work, skills, and stores of information of any kind having to do with secret words and meanings—that is to say, ''yitang'' lore. Breadfruit is used here as a figure of speech for knowledge. And the breadfruit of knowledge is contained in all five bowls, even though the names of only three of them include the word for pounded breadfruit, and even though only the last contains knowledge about breadfruit in that word's literal meaning. Thus, the Puluwat people classify ''yitang'' information into five categories: war, magic, meetings, navigation, and breadfruit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an [[etiological]] [[Hawaiian mythology|Hawaiian myth]], the breadfruit originated from the sacrifice of the war god [[Kū]]. After deciding to live secretly among mortals as a farmer, Kū married and had children. He and his family lived happily until a famine seized their island. When he could no longer bear to watch his children suffer, Kū told his wife that he could deliver them from starvation, but to do so he would have to leave them. Reluctantly she agreed, and at her word, Kū descended into the ground right where he had stood until only the top of his head was visible. His family waited around the spot he had last been, day and night, watering it with their tears until suddenly, a small green shoot appeared where Kū had stood. Quickly, the shoot grew into a tall and leafy tree that was laden with heavy breadfruits that Kū's family and neighbors gratefully ate, joyfully saved from starvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mauimagazine.net/breadfruit/|title=Breadfruit|publisher=Maui Nō Ka ʻOi Magazine, Haynes Publishing Group|author=Shannon Wianecki|date=May–June 2013|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though they are widely distributed throughout the Pacific, many breadfruit [[Hybrid (biology)#Plant hybrid|hybrids]] and [[cultivar]]s are seedless or otherwise biologically incapable of naturally dispersing long distances. Therefore, it is clear that humans aided distribution of the plant in the Pacific,  specifically prehistoric groups who colonized the Pacific Islands. To investigate the patterns of human migration throughout the Pacific, scientists have used molecular dating of breadfruit hybrids and cultivars in concert with anthropological data. Results support the west-to-east migration hypothesis, in which the [[Lapita]] people are thought to have traveled from [[Melanesia]] to numerous [[Polynesia]]n islands.&lt;ref name=zerega/&gt;

The world's largest collection of breadfruit varieties was established by botanist Diane Ragone, from over 20 years' travel to 50 Pacific islands, on a {{convert|10|acre|hectare|adj=on}} plot outside of [[Hana, Hawaii|Hana]], on the isolated east coast of [[Maui]] ([[Hawaii]]).&lt;ref name="StelleWolfordHanaHou"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hanahou.com/pages/Magazine.asp?Action=DrawArticle&amp;ArticleID=801&amp;MagazineID=51 |title= Tree of Plenty |author1=Julia Steele |author2=photos by Jack Wolford |work= [[Hana Hou!]] |volume=12, No. 4 |date= August–September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Glass fracture.jpg|thumb|200px|Brittle fracture in [[glass]]]]
[[Image:Cast iron tensile test.JPG|thumb|200px|Brittle fracture in [[cast iron]] tensile testpieces]]A material is '''brittle''' if, when subjected to [[stress (physics)|stress]], it breaks without significant [[Plastic Deformation|plastic deformation]]. Brittle materials absorb relatively little [[energy]] prior to fracture, even those of high [[Strength of materials|strength]]. Breaking is often accompanied by a snapping sound. Brittle materials include most [[ceramic materials|ceramics]] and [[glass]]es (which do not deform plastically) and some [[polymer]]s, such as [[Polymethyl methacrylate|PMMA]] and [[polystyrene]]. Many [[steel]]s become brittle at low temperatures (see [[Ductile-brittle transition#Ductile-brittle transition temperature|ductile-brittle transition temperature]]), depending on their composition and processing.

When used in [[materials science]], it is generally applied to materials that fail when there is little or no [[plasticity (physics)|plastic deformation]] before failure. One proof is to match the broken halves, which should fit exactly since no plastic deformation has occurred.

When a material has reached the limit of its strength, it usually has the option of either deformation or fracture.  A naturally [[malleable]] metal can be made stronger by impeding the mechanisms of plastic deformation (reducing [[grain size]], [[precipitation hardening]], [[work hardening]], etc.), but if this is taken to an extreme, fracture becomes the more likely outcome, and the material can become brittle.  Improving material [[toughness]] is therefore a balancing act.

==Toughening==
[[Image:Brittle v ductile stress-strain behaviour.png|thumb|200px|Graph comparing [[stress–strain curve]]s for brittle and ductile materials|left]]This principle generalizes to other classes of material.  Naturally brittle materials, such as  [[glass]], are not difficult to toughen effectively.  Most such techniques involve one of two [[fracture toughening mechanisms|mechanisms]]: to deflect or absorb the tip of a propagating crack, or to create carefully controlled [[Stress (physics)#Residual stress|residual stresses]] so that cracks from certain predictable sources will be forced closed. The first principle is used in [[laminated glass]] where two sheets of glass are separated by an interlayer of [[polyvinyl butyral]], which as a [[viscoelastic]] polymer absorbs the growing crack. The second method is used in [[toughened glass]] and [[pre-stressed concrete]]. A demonstration of glass toughening is provided by [[Prince Rupert's Drop]]. Brittle [[polymers]] can be toughened by using metal particles to initiate crazes when a sample is stressed, a good example being [[high impact polystyrene|high-impact polystyrene]] or HIPS. The least brittle structural ceramics are [[silicon carbide]] (mainly by virtue of its high strength) and transformation-toughened [[zirconia]].

A different philosophy is used in [[composite materials]], where brittle [[glass fibre]]s, for example, are embedded in a ductile matrix such as [[polyester resin]]. When strained, cracks are formed at the glass–matrix interface, but so many are formed that much energy is absorbed and the material is thereby toughened. The same principle is used in creating [[metal matrix composite]]s.

==Effect of pressure==
Generally, the ''[[brittle strength]]'' of a material can be increased by [[pressure]]. This happens as an example in the [[brittle-ductile transition zone]] at an approximate depth of {{convert|10|km}} in the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]], at which rock becomes less likely to fracture, and more likely to deform [[Ductility|ductilely]] (see [[rheid]]).

==Crack growth==
[[Supersonic fracture]] is crack motion faster than the speed of sound in a brittle material.  This phenomenon was first discovered{{Citation needed|reason=when? in what material?|date=February 2011}} by scientists from the [[Max Planck Institute for Metals Research]] in [[Stuttgart]] ([[Markus J. Buehler]] and [[Huajian Gao]]) and [[IBM Almaden Research Center]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California ([[Farid F. Abraham]]).

[[File:Front_image_for_CORENA.jpg|thumb|right|Citizens Own Renewable Energy Network Australia Inc.]]
'''CORENA''' is an abbreviation of "Citizens [sic] Own Renewable Energy Network Australia Incorporated", an Australian [[nonprofit organisation]] based in [[Modbury, South Australia]] that relies on voluntary contributions from the public to fund practical [[renewable energy]] projects.

== History ==
The concept was inspired by a conversation between founder Margaret Hender and a relative, wherein they discussed the possibility of [[Renewable energy in Australia|Australia]] becoming powered entirely by renewable energy. A study published by [[Beyond Zero Emissions]] established that the goal was achievable if each household contributed $8 per week over 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stationary Energy Plan|url=http://bze.org.au/zero-carbon-australia/stationary-energy-plan|publisher=Beyond Zero Emissions|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus CORENA was established to act as a focal point for the community desire to participate in such a scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who we are|url=http://corenafund.org.au/who-we-are/|publisher=CORENA fund|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CORENA was incorporated on 22 April 2013.

=== Name ===
The lack of an apostrophe in the official title of the organisation stems from the requirement that the name of a financial institution account needs to exactly match the name of an organisation as it appears in its incorporation documents. Furthermore, the account name input fields of financial institutions don't accept the apostrophe as a valid character, causing deposits to bounce if the entered name does not match the account name. Hence for practical reasons the apostrophe remains omitted in spite of the grammatical error.

== Projects ==

=== Big Win Project ===
The first Big Win project aims to collect AU$5 million initially, with the aim of using this money to enable the first stage of building a 50 MegaWatt [[solar thermal energy|solar thermal]] and storage plant, including planning, the purchase of land and auxiliary power.

=== Quick Win Projects ===
CORENA also co-ordinates a series of Quick Win projects that provide interest-free loans, consisting of money collected through donations, to nonprofit community groups to install solar power or solar hot water systems and/or for energy efficiency measures.

'''The Conservancy Association''' ({{zh|t=長春社}}) is a Hong Kong non-governmental organisation founded in 1968.&lt;ref name = HKU&gt;{{cite book | title = Growing with Hong Kong: The University and Its Graduates : the First 90 Years | year = 2002 | publisher = Hong Kong University Press | isbn = 9622096131 | page = 166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation focuses on the protection of the environment and the conservation of natural and cultural heritage. It also seeks to enhance the quality of life of both current and future generations, and to ensure that Hong Kong shoulders her regional and global environmental responsibilities. The organisation advocates appropriate policies, monitors government action, promotes environmental education and takes a lead in community participation.&lt;ref name = scmp&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1486130/loopholes-protection-two-key-wildlife-sites-conservancy-association | title = Loopholes in protection of two key wildlife sites: Conservancy Association | accessdate = 26 May 2017 | work = [[South China Morning Post]] | author = Cheung Chi Fai | date = 18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = SEBC&gt;{{cite web | url = https://socialenterprise.org.hk/en/sedb/orgs/PInegyzWRquso2om1KIewg | title = Organization: The Conservancy Association | accessdate = 26 May 2017 | publisher = /socialenterprise.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1967, John H. Pain (1930 - 2018&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thetimes-uk/obituary.aspx?n=john-hugh-pain&amp;pid=189272348 John Pain Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;) of Hong Kong Tourist Association, Prof. Brian Loft (1929 - 2015&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daao.hku.hk/fbook/cnews/2016summer/files/assets/basic-html/page57.html Summer Issue, 2016 - Page 57]&lt;/ref&gt;) of the [[University of Hong Kong]], Jeremy Brown of [[Jardine Matheson]] and a Scottish lady Agnes Black formed a rambling group called "Bauhina's Circle". Their regard for the Hong Kong countryside came at the right time as the Hong Kong government made plans in 1968 for a "Provisional Council for the Use and Conservation of the Countryside", an idea from a government-commissioned report "Conservation of the Hong Kong Countryside" by Lee M Talbot. The idea of forming an association came during one of these walks when they saw the ass destruction of the village land. In October 1968, they gathered at [[The Helena May main building|Helena May Institute]] and declared themselves "the Conservancy Association" - thus was born the first ever green group of Hong Kong.

Soon they recruited Robert N. Rayne of the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], together with Prof. S. Y. Hu of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Michael A. Webster, a keen bird-watcher, Sir Lindsay Ride, former Vice Chancellor of Hong Kong University and the others. Father H. Naylor of Wah Yan College, was invited by Robert N. Rayne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hnaylor.net/docs/Chapter%209%20Environmental%20Concerns.html Father Naylor's Official Website, Chapter 9, Environmental Concerns]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Harold Naylor, "Blessings from the heart", "Conservancy Association, Silver Jubilee", page 32&lt;/ref&gt; They became the founders of the association. In late 1969, it was formally registered as a society. The first Annual General Meeting was held in 1970 and Robert N. Rayne was elected as Chairman with Michael Webster as Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/04/06/preface-the-making-of-hong-kong-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr. WK Chan (2008), Preface, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Dr. [[Ding Lik-kiu]] was invited by John H. Pain to join the association.&lt;ref&gt;Bernald Fong (1994), Chapter 17, "Out of the shadow: life and times of Ding Lik-Kiu"&lt;/ref&gt;

A membership drive and fund raising campaign was then launched.&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/04/06/preface-the-making-of-hong-kong-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr. WK Chan (2008), Preface, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May 1972, the Conservancy Association published a full-page advertisement on [[South China Morning Post]] by listing their "Founding Members".&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/04/07/chp-1-conservancy-association-founded-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 1, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 1972 workshop, members of the association reached a consensus that Hong Kong's countryside was threatened and would "cease to exist in an acceptable form" unless concrete action was taken to protect it. The association also considered pollution in urban areas an imminent threat to public health. It pressed the government to take action to turn Hong Kong from "one of the dirtiest, and potentially unhealthiest, cities in Asia to one of the cleanest, with clean air, clean water, clean streets, and community-conscious people."&lt;ref name="rot"&gt;{{cite news|title='Stop the rot right now,' says HK's Conservancy Association|work=South China Morning Post|date=3 February 1972|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the association positioned itself as a pressure group on environmental issues and launched a series of campaigns. In the early 1970s the association opposed the construction of a petrochemical complex on Lamma Island, proposed by Shell. This proposal was withdrawn in January 1975.&lt;ref name="shut"&gt;{{cite news|title=Refinery door not yet shut on Shell|work=South China Morning Post|date=9 January 1975|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same decade, the association opposed the construction of the [[Lamma Power Station]], which was eventually built.&lt;ref name="apathy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Vivian|title=Lamma–apathy island|work=South China Morning Post|date=11 June 1978|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having enlightened by the discussion of Earth Summit in Stockholm,&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/04/09/chp-3-the-earth-conference-1972-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 3, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; Father Naylor launched various environmental educational activities to teach local students about environmental protection, including the establishment of "Youth Environmental Action Group"&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/04/10/chp-4-youth-environment-action-group-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 4, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; and "School Conservancy Clubs Liaison Board".&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/04/11/chp-5-school-conservancy-clubs-liaison-board-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 5, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1977 to 1980, the association worked with "Hong Kong Heritage Society" and launched a series of heritage conservation campaigns, including the conservation of [[Kowloon railway station (KCR)|Tsim Sha Tsui Railway Terminal]], [[Victoria Barracks, Hong Kong|Victoria Block]], [[Hong Kong Club]] Building and [[Court of Final Appeal Building|Supreme Court]]...etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/04/27/chp-21-tsim-sha-tsui-rail-terminus-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 21, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/chp-22-victoria-barracks-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 22, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/04/29/chp-23-tsim-sha-tsui-hill-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WKChan (2008), Chapter 23, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/05/01/chp-25-hong-kong-club-and-supreme-court-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 25, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various campaigns were launched during the 1980s. The Association was a member of the Joint Organisation of the Concerned for Nuclear Energy (JOCNE) and opposed the establishment of the [[Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/05/04/chp-28-daya-bay-nuclear-power-plant-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 28, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; Being championed by its member Simon Chau Siu-cheung, the association also launched the "No [[Monosodium glutamate|MSG]] Campaign"&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/05/07/chp-31-sustainable-consumption-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 31, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; and promote prudent use of plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/05/11/chp-35-waste-reduction-campaigns-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 35, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HK Sai Ying Pun Third Street n Western Street Brick building Conservancy Association Sunday.JPG|thumb|left|CACHe]]

In 1988, the association established the Hong Kong Environmental Centre within its office as the first environmental resource centre open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/04/08/chp-2-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr. WK Chan (2008), Chapter 2, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1990s, the association worked with other green groups in Hong Kong to campaign against the development of countryside, such as [[Sha Lo Tung]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/06/02/chp-56-sha-lo-tung-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 56, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nam Sang Wai]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/06/03/chp-57-nam-sang-wai-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 57, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;...etc. The association also advocated the Environmental Impact Assessment Bill&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/05/23/chp-46-environmental-impact-assessment-bill-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 46, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Nature Conservation Policy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/06/10/chp-64-conservation-policy-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 64, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "No [[Fat choy|Fat Choy]] for good fortune (不吃髮菜齊發財)" movement was launched against the environmental vandalism of the destroy of grassland in mainland China in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/05/07/chp-31-sustainable-consumption-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 31, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

The association opposed the alignment of [[Lok Ma Chau Spur Line]] in order to protect [[Long Valley, Hong Kong|Long Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/07/02/chp-85-long-valley-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment-2/ Dr WK Chan (2008), Chapter 85, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the association helped organise a campaign against the plan to tear down [[Harbour Place|Hunghom Peninsula]], a brand new housing estate built as [[Home Ownership Scheme]] public housing but sold instead to [[Sun Hung Kai Properties]] and [[New World Development]] following completion.&lt;ref name="drive"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lai|first1=Chloe|title=Signature drive to save waterfront estate|work=South China Morning Post|date=26 April 2004|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a massive backlash and facing a public relations disaster, the developers rescinded the plans and decided to renovate the estate instead.&lt;ref name="renovated"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connolly|first1=Norma|title=Hunghom Peninsula to be renovated|work=South China Morning Post|date=7 July 2005|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Conservancy Association's Hong Kong Environment Centre was transformed into the Conservancy Association Centre for Heritage (CACHe).&lt;ref&gt;[https://granniegreen.wordpress.com/2015/04/08/chp-2-forty-years-champion-for-the-environment/ Dr. WK Chan (2008), Chapter 2, Forty Years Champion for the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==

===[[Tree]] Conservation ===
CA has actively initiated a variety of tree conservation and education works over the past years. Different tree activities included “Arbor Day”, tree appreciation tours, tree risk assessment training workshops, tree-scapes and wall trees photo competitions etc. were organized to raise the public awareness on tree appreciation as well as the importance of [[urban forestry]].

Apart from urban trees, CA also focus on [[woodland]]s in countryside. CA has participated in several [[tree planting]] schemes, organized tree planting activities in different hillsides, not only to provide chances for public to participate into tree works, but also to improve ecological values of local woodland habitats.

===[[Nature]] Conservation ===
The Conservancy Association considers that [[Nature|natural]] and [[cultural heritage]] is an invaluable public asset, belonging to the society and posterity. It is part of the "[[social capital]]s" of Hong Kong. Management of this asset in a [[Sustainability|sustainable manner]] will not only enhance our quality of life, but also contribute substantially to Hong Kong's competitiveness.

=== Waste Reduction and [[Recycling]] ===
CA spares no efforts in the promotion of waste reduction and recycling. We work closely with government departments, property management companies, [[housing estate]]s, [[school]]s and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] in organizing educational and recycling programmes for different audiences, aiming to encourage the general public to achieve waste reduction in daily lives.

=== Environmental Education ===
Community education work is one of the tasks that CA pays attention to. Other than Talks and Guided Tours in traditional formats, education activities provided by CA tend to be diversified , such as green mass games, drama-in-education activities, children's stories, carnivals, Liberal Studies discussion and facilities visits etc., covering a variety of audience from kindergarten kids, primary, secondary &amp; tertiary students and families. Through different experiences, participants could learn to know the natural environment and be more willing to protect environment.

'''Copper indium gallium (di)selenide''' ('''CIGS''') is a [[Alkali metal|I]]-[[Group 3 element|III]]-[[Group 6 element|VI]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[semiconductor material]] composed of [[copper]], [[indium]], [[gallium]], and [[selenium]]. The material is a [[solid solution]] of '''copper indium selenide''' (often abbreviated "CIS") and '''copper gallium selenide'''. It has a chemical formula of CuIn&lt;sub&gt;(1-x)&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;(x)&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where the value of x can vary from 0 (pure copper indium selenide) to 1 (pure copper gallium selenide). CIGS is a [[tetrahedral]]ly [[chemical bond|bond]]ed semiconductor, with the [[chalcopyrite]] crystal structure, and a [[bandgap]] varying continuously with ''x'' from about 1.0 eV (for copper indium selenide) to about 1.7 eV (for copper gallium selenide).

==Structure==

CIGS is a [[tetrahedral]]ly [[chemical bond|bond]]ed semiconductor, with the [[chalcopyrite]] crystal structure. Upon heating it transforms to the [[zincblende]] form and the transition temperature decreases from 1045&amp;nbsp;°C for x=0 to 805&amp;nbsp;°C for x=1.&lt;ref name=str/&gt;

== Applications ==

It is best known as the material for [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells|CIGS solar cells]] a [[thin-film solar cells|thin-film technology]] used in the [[photovoltaic]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/review_meeting/pdfs/prm2009_contreras_cigs.pdf|title=DOE Solar Energy Technologies Program Peer Review|publisher=U.S. department of energy 2009|accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this role, CIGS has the advantage of being able to be deposited on flexible substrate materials, producing highly flexible, lightweight [[solar panel]]s. Improvements in efficiency have made CIGS an established technology among alternative cell materials.

'''Deathnium''' is a name given by early electronic engineers to a trap in [[semiconductors]] that reduced the lifetime of both electron and hole [[charge carriers]]. It is considered the fifth of the imperfections that must be considered in semiconductor crystals to understand semiconductor effects along with [[Electron hole|holes]], [[Electron|electrons]], [[Donor (semiconductors)|donors]], and [[Acceptor (semiconductors)|acceptors]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nobel Lectures in Physics, Volumes 1942-1962|last=|first=|publisher=World Scientific|year=1998|isbn=9810234031|location=Singapore|pages=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deathnium hastens the establishment of equilibrium between holes and electrons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This condition was not anticipated but it emerged during the invention of [[bipolar junction transistor]] after the influence of deep-trap impurities introduced by contamination of the manufacturing machinery, which reduced the lifetime of semiconductor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Patents, Inventions and the Dynamics of Innovation: A Multidisciplinary Study|last=Cullis|first=Roger|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2007|isbn=9781845429584|location=Cheltenham, UK|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habitat destruction and fragmentation ===
[[File:Lacanja burn.JPG|thumb|Lacanja burn shows deforestation]]

Human population growth results in changes in land-use, which can cause natural habitats to become fragmented, altered, or destroyed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Large mammals are often more vulnerable to extinction than smaller animals because they require larger [[home range]]s and thus are more prone to suffer the effects of [[deforestation]]. Large species such as [[elephant]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, large [[primate]]s, [[tapir]]s and [[Peccary|peccaries]] are the first animals to disappear in fragmented [[rainforest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kinnaird, M. F., Sanderson, E. W., O'Brien, T. G., Wibisono, H. T. and Woolmer, G., "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Sanderson2/publication/227602224_Deforestation_Trends_in_a_Tropical_Landscape_and_Implications_for_Endangered_Large_Mammals/links/0912f5108705b72742000000.pdf Deforestation Trends in a Tropical Landscape and Implications for Endangered Large Mammals.]" ''Conservation Biology'' (2003) 17: 245–257.&lt;/ref&gt;

A case study from Amazonian Ecuador analyzed two oil-road management approaches and their effects on the surrounding wildlife communities. The free-access road had forests that were cleared and fragmented and the other had enforced access control. Fewer species were found along the first road with density estimates being almost 80% lower than at the second site that which had minimal disturbance.&lt;ref name="oil roads"&gt;Suárez, E., Morales, M., Cueva, R., Utreras Bucheli, V., Zapata-Ríos, G., Toral, E., Torres, J., Prado, W. and Vargas Olalla, J., "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Galo_Zapata-Rios/publication/229528550_Oil_Industry_Wild_Meat_Trade_and_Roads_Indirect_Effects_of_Oil_Extraction_Activities_in_a_Protected_Area_in_North-Eastern_Ecuador/links/02e7e528ccfdcbb399000000/Oil-Industry-Wild-Meat-Trade-and-Roads-Indirect-Effects-of-Oil-Extraction-Activities-in-a-Protected-Area-in-North-Eastern-Ecuador.pdf Oil Industry, Wild Meat Trade and Roads: Indirect Effects of Oil Extraction Activities in a Protected Area in North-Eastern Ecuador.]" ''Animal Conservation'' 12 (2009): 364–373.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding suggests that disturbances affected the local animals' willingness and ability to travel between patches.[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|right|Fishbone deforestation pattern.

[[Habitat fragmentation|Fragmentation]] lowers populations while increasing extinction risk when the remaining [[habitat]] size is small.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When there is more unfragmented land, there is more habitat for more diverse species. A larger land patch also means it can accommodate more species with larger [[home range]]s.  However, when patch size decreases, there is an increase in the number of isolated fragments which can remain unoccupied by local [[fauna]]. If this persists, species may become extinct in the area.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Rybicki, J., "[http://izt.ciens.ucv.ve/ecologia/Archivos/ECO_POB%202013/ECOPO2_2013/Ecological%20effects%20of%20environ.%20change/Rybicki%20y%20Hanski%202013.pdf Species–area Relationships and Extinctions Caused by Habitat Loss and Fragmentation.]" ''Ecology Letters'' 16 (2013): 27-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon]] looked at two patterns of [[habitat fragmentation]]: "fish-bone" in smaller properties and another unnamed large property pattern. The large property pattern contained fewer fragments than the smaller fish-bone pattern. The results suggested that higher levels of fragmentation within the fish-bone pattern led to the [[loss of species]] and decreased diversity of large vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, D. A., Hobbs, R. J. and Margules, C. R., "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Denis_Saunders/publication/227638151_Saunders_D_Hobbs_R_Margules_C_Biological_Consequences_of_Ecosystem_Fragmentation_A_Review_Conservation_Biology/links/53d20be10cf2a7fbb2e9620f/Saunders-D-Hobbs-R-Margules-C-Biological-Consequences-of-Ecosystem-Fragmentation-A-Review-Conservation-Biology.pdf Biological Consequences of Ecosystem Fragmentation: A Review.]" ''Conservation Biology'' 5 (1991): 18–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Human impacts, such as the fragmentation of forests, may cause large areas to lose the ability to maintain [[biodiversity]] and [[ecosystem function]] due to loss of key ecological processes.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge, M.

=== Invasive species ===

Human influences, such as colonization and agriculture, have caused species to become distributed outside of their native ranges.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fragmentation also has cascading effects on native species, beyond reducing habitat and resource availability; it leaves areas vulnerable to non-native invasions. [[Invasive species]] can out-compete or directly prey upon native species, as well as alter the habitat so that native species can no longer survive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oil roads"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeschke, J., et. al. "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12299/full Defining the Impact of Non-Native Species.]" ''Conservation Biology'' 28.5 (2014): 1188-1194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In extinct animal species for which the cause of extinction is known, over 50% were affected by invasive species. For 20% of extinct animal species, invasive species are the only cited cause of extinction. Invasive species are the second-most important cause of extinction for mammals.&lt;ref&gt;Clavero, M., Garcia-Berthou, E. "[http://dugi-doc.udg.edu:8080/bitstream/handle/10256/12285/InvasiveSpeciesLeading.pdf?sequence=1 Invasive Species are a Leading Cause of Animal Extinctions.]" ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 20.3 (2005): 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global patterns ==

Tropical regions are the most heavily impacted by defaunation.&lt;ref name="def ant" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt; These regions, which include the [[Brazilian Amazon]], the [[Congo Basin]] of Central Africa, and [[Indonesia]], experience the greatest rates of overexploitation and [[habitat degradation]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, specific causes are varied, and areas with one endangered group (such as birds) do not necessarily also have other endangered groups (such as mammals, insects, or amphibians).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: Global map shows new patterns of extinction risk|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_2-11-2006-10-49-47|work=Imperial College London and the Natural Environment Research Council|date=2 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon leads to habitat fragmentation and overexploitation. Hunting pressure in the Amazon rainforest has increased as traditional hunting techniques have been replaced by modern weapons such as shotguns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Access roads built for mining and logging operations fragment the forest landscape and allow hunters to move into forested areas which previously were untouched.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The bushmeat trade in Central Africa incentivizes the overexploitation of local fauna.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Indonesia has the most endangered animal species of any area in the world.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Endangered Species in Indonesia - Australian Science|url = http://www.australianscience.com.au/environmental-science/endangered-species-in-indonesia/|website = Australian Science|accessdate = 2015-11-30|language = en-US|first = Ivanovic,|last = Josip}}&lt;/ref&gt; International trade in wild animals, as well as extensive logging, mining and agriculture operations, drive the decline and extinction of numerous species.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Ecological impacts ==

=== Genetic loss ===
[[Inbreeding]] and [[genetic diversity]] loss often occur with endangered species populations because they have small and/or declining populations. Loss of genetic diversity lowers the ability of a population to deal with change in their environment and can make individuals within the community [[homogeneous]]. If this occurs, these animals are more susceptible to [[disease]] and other occurrences that may target a specific [[genome]]. Without genetic diversity, one disease could eradicate an entire species. Inbreeding lowers reproduction and [[survival rate]]s. It is suggested that these genetic factors contribute to the extinction risk in threatened/endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;Frankham, R., "Genetics and Conservation Biology." C. R. ''Biologies'' 326 (2003): S22-S29.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seed dispersal ===

==== Effects on plants and forest structure ====
The consequences of defaunation can be expected to affect the plant community. There are three non-mutually exclusive conclusions as to the consequences on tropical forest plant communities:

# If seed dispersal agents are targeted by hunters, the effectiveness and amount of dispersal for those plant species will be reduced&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt;
# The species composition of the [[seedling]] and [[sapling]] layers will be altered by hunting,&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt; and
# Selective hunting of medium/large-sized animals instead of small-sized animals will lead to different seed predation patterns, with an emphasis on smaller seeds&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Galetti 2–7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Defaunation affects the populations and diets of rodents in Neotropical rainforests|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632071500186X|journal = Biological Conservation|date = 2015-10-01|pages = 2–7|volume = 190|doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2015.04.032|first = Mauro|last = Galetti|first2 = Roger|last2 = Guevara|first3 = Carolina L.|last3 = Neves|first4 = Raisa R.|last4 = Rodarte|first5 = Ricardo S.|last5 = Bovendorp|first6 = Marcelo|last6 = Moreira|first7 = John B.|last7 = Hopkins III|first8 = Justin D.|last8 = Yeakel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent study analyzed seedling density and composition from two areas, Los Tuxtlas and Montes Azules. Los Tuxtlas, which is affected more by human activity, showed higher seedling density and a smaller average number of different species than in the other area. Results suggest that an absence of vertebrate dispersers can change the structure and diversity of forests.&lt;ref&gt;Dirzo, R. and Miranda, A.

In: ''Plant-Animal Interactions: Evolutionary ecology in tropical and temperate regions''. P. W. Price, T. M. Lewinsohn, G. W. Fernandes &amp; W. W. Benson (Eds.). Wiley and Sons Pub. New York pp: 273-287.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a plant community that relies on animals for dispersal could potentially have an altered [[biodiversity]], species [[Dominance (ecology)|dominance]], survival, [[demography]], and spatial and genetic structure.&lt;ref&gt;Beaune, David. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Beaune/publication/256303581_Seed_dispersal_strategies_and_the_threat_of_defaunation_in_a_Congo_forest/links/00b4952246469ee96c000000.pdf Seed Dispersal Strategies and the Threat of Defaunation in a Congo Forest]." ''Biodiversity and Conservation'' 22.1 (2013): 225-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poaching is likely to alter plant composition because the interactions between game and plant species varies in strength. Some game species interact strongly, weakly, or not at all with species. A change in plant species composition is likely to be a result because the net effect removal of game species varies among the plant species they interact with.&lt;ref name="poachers alter"/&gt;

==== Effects on small-bodied seed dispersers and predators ====

As large-bodied vertebrates are increasingly lost from seed-dispersal networks, small-bodied seed dispersers (i.e. bats, birds, dung beetles) and seed predators (i.e. rodents) are affected. Defaunation leads to reduced species diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Seed predation in a human-modified tropical landscape|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S026646741500019X|journal = Journal of Tropical Ecology|date = 2015-07-01|issn = 1469-7831|pages = 379–383|volume = 31|issue = 4|doi = 10.1017/S026646741500019X|first = Jenny|last = Zambrano|first2 = Rosamond|last2 = Coates|first3 = Henry F.|last3 = Howe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Selective defaunation affects dung beetle communities in continuous Atlantic rainforest|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320713000992|journal = Biological Conservation|date = 2013-07-01|pages = 79–89|volume = 163|series = Special Issue: Defaunation's impact in terrestrial tropical ecosystems|doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2013.04.004|first = Laurence|last = Culot|first2 = Emilie|last2 = Bovy|first3 = Fernando|last3 = Zagury Vaz-de-Mello|first4 = Roger|last4 = Guevara|first5 = Mauro|last5 = Galetti}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to relaxed competition; small-bodied species normally compete with large-bodied vertebrates for food and other resources. As an area becomes defaunated, dominant small-bodied species take over, crowding out other similar species and leading to an overall reduced species diversity.&lt;ref name="Galetti 2–7"/&gt; The loss of species diversity is reflective of a larger [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], which has consequences for the maintenance of [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The quality of the physical habitat may also suffer. Bird and bat species (many of who are small bodied seed dispersers) rely on [[Geophagy|mineral licks]] as a source of sodium, which is not available elsewhere in their diets. In defaunated areas in the Western Amazon, mineral licks are more thickly covered by vegetation and have lower water availability. Bats were significantly less likely to visit these degraded mineral licks.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Defaunation of tropical forests reduces habitat quality for seed-dispersing bats in Western Amazonia: an unexpected connection via mineral licks|journal = Animal Conservation|date = 2014-02-01|issn = 1469-1795|pages = 44–51|volume = 17|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/acv.12055|first = S. J.|last = Ghanem|first2 = C. C.|last2 = Voigt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degradation of such licks will thus negatively affect the health and reproduction of bat populations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Defaunation has negative consequences for seed dispersal networks as well. In the western Amazon, birds and bats have separate diets and thus form separate [[Guild (ecology)|guilds]] within the network.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Partitioning of seed dispersal services between birds and bats in a fragment of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest|url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1984-46702014000300006&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal = Zoologia (Curitiba)|issn = 1984-4670|pages = 245–255|volume = 31|issue = 3|doi = 10.1590/S1984-46702014000300006|first = Raissa|last = Sarmento|first2 = Cecília P.|last2 = Alves-Costa|first3 = Adriana|last3 = Ayub|first4 = Marco A. R.|last4 = Mello|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that large-bodied vertebrates, being generalists, connect separate guilds, creating a stable, [[Ecological resilience|resilient]] network. Defaunation results in a highly modular network in which specialized frugivores instead act as the connector hubs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Ecosystem services===
{{main|ecosystem services}}
Changes in predation dynamics, seed predation, seed dispersal, carrion removal, dung removal, vegetation trampling, and other ecosystem processes as a result of defaunation can affect ecosystem supporting and regulatory services, such as [[nutrient cycling]] and [[decomposition]], crop pollination, [[pest control]], and [[water quality]].&lt;ref name="def ant" /&gt;

=== Conservation ===
Efforts against defaunation include wildlife overpasses&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pell|first=Stuart|last2=Jones|first2=Darryl|date=2015-04-01|title=Are wildlife overpasses of conservation value for birds? A study in Australian sub-tropical forest, with wider implications|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320715000609|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=184|pages=300–309|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2015.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and riparian corridors.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Şekercioğlu|first=Çağan H.|last2=Loarie|first2=Scott R.|last3=Oviedo-Brenes|first3=Federico|last4=Mendenhall|first4=Chase D.|last5=Daily|first5=Gretchen C.|last6=Ehrlich|first6=Paul R.|date=2015-12-01|title=Tropical countryside riparian corridors provide critical habitat and connectivity for seed-dispersing forest birds in a fragmented landscape|journal=Journal of Ornithology|language=en|volume=156|issue=1|pages=343–353|doi=10.1007/s10336-015-1299-x|issn=2193-7192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these can be otherwise known as [[wildlife crossing]] mechanisms. Wildlife overpasses are specifically used for the purpose of protecting many animal species from the roads.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Many countries use them and they have been found to be very effective in protecting species and allowing forests to be connected.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These overpasses look like bridges of forest that cross over many roads, like a walk bridge for humans, allowing animals to migrate from one side of the forest to the other safely since the road cut off the original connectivity.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It was concluded in a study done by Pell and Jones, looking at bird use of these corridors in Australia, that many birds did, in fact, use these corridors to travel from one side of forest to the other and although they did not spend much time in the corridor specifically, they did commonly use them.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Riparian corridors are very similar to overpasses they are just on flat land and not on bridges, however, they also work as connective "bridges" between fragmented pieces of forest. One study done connected the corridors with bird habitat and use for seed dispersal.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The conclusions of this study showed that some species of birds are highly dependent on these corridors as connections between forest, as flying across the open land is not ideal for many species.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Overall both of these studies agree that some sort of connectivity needs to be established between fragments in order to keep the forest ecosystem in the best health possible and that they have in fact been very effective.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Marine ==
Defaunation in the [[marine biology|ocean]] has occurred later and less intensely than on land. A relatively small number of marine species have been driven to extinction. However, many species have undergone local, ecological, and commercial extinction.&lt;ref name="mar def"&gt;McCauley, D. J., Pinsky, M. L., [[Stephen R. Palumbi|Palumbi, S. R.]], Estes, J. A., Joyce, F. H., and Warner, R. R., "[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1gj9w82r.pdf Marine defaunation: Animal loss in the global ocean.]" ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' 347 (2015): 12555641.&lt;/ref&gt; Most large marine animal species still exist, such that the size distribution of global species assemblages has changed little since the Pleistocene, but individuals of each species are smaller on average, and [[overfishing]] has caused reductions in genetic diversity. Most extinctions and population declines to date have been driven by human overexploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Dulvy, N. K., Pinnegar, J. K., and Reynolds, J. D. "[http://www.dulvy.com/uploads/2/1/0/4/21048414/dulvy_holoceneextinctions2009.pdf Holocene extinctions in the sea.]" Pages 129-150 Turvey., S. T., editor. Holocene Extinctions. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
Marine defaunation has a wide array of effects on ecosystem structure and function. The loss of animals can have both top-down (cascading) and bottom-up effects,&lt;ref&gt;Myers, R. A., Baum, J. K., Shepherd, T. D.,  Powers, S. P., and Peterson, C. H. "[http://people.umass.edu/bethanyb/GCE/Myers%20et%20al.,%202007%20sharks.pdf Cascading effects of the loss of apex predatory sharks from a coastal ocean]". ''Science'' 315 (2007):1846–1850.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cury, P. M., Boyd, I. L., Bonhommeau, S., Anker-Nilssen, T., Crawford, R. J., Furness, R. W., ... &amp; Sydeman, W. J., "[http://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00056/16770/14307.pdf Global seabird response to forage fish depletion—one-third for the birds]". ''Science'', 334(2011), 1703-1706.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as consequences for [[biogeochemical cycling]], [[ecosystem connectivity]], and [[ecosystem stability]].

Two of the most important ecosystem services threatened by marine defaunation are the provision of food and coastal storm protection.&lt;ref name="mar def" /&gt;

'''Diagenesis''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˌ|d|aɪ|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ᵻ|s|ɪ|s}}) is the change of [[sediments]] or existing [[sedimentary rocks]] into a different sedimentary rock during and after rock formation ([[lithification]]), at temperatures and pressures less than that required for the formation of [[metamorphic rocks]].&lt;ref Name = EG&gt;Marshak, Stephen, 2009, ''Essentials of Geology,'' W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 3rd ed. {{ISBN|978-0393196566}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not include changes from [[weathering]].&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; It is any chemical, physical, or biological change undergone by a [[sediment]] after its initial deposition, after its lithification. This process excludes surface alteration ([[weathering]]) and [[metamorphism]]. These changes happen at relatively low temperatures and pressures and result in changes to the rock's original [[mineral]]ogy and texture. There is no sharp boundary between diagenesis and [[metamorphism]], but the latter occurs at higher [[temperature]]s and [[pressure]]s. Hydrothermal solutions, meteoric groundwater, porosity, permeability, solubility, and time are all influential factors.

After deposition, sediments are compacted as they are buried beneath successive layers of sediment and cemented by minerals that precipitate from [[solution]]. Grains of sediment, [[Rock (geology)|rock]] fragments and [[fossil]]s can be replaced by other minerals during diagenesis. [[Porosity]] usually decreases during diagenesis, except in rare cases such as [[solvation|dissolution]] of minerals and [[dolomitization]].

The study of diagenesis in rocks is used to understand the geologic history they have undergone and the nature and type of fluids that have circulated through them. From a commercial standpoint, such studies aid in assessing the likelihood of finding various economically viable mineral and [[hydrocarbon]] deposits.

The process of diagenesis is also important in the decomposition of bone tissue.&lt;ref name="Hedges"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedges | first1 = R. E.

== Role of diagenesis in anthropology and paleontology ==

The term diagenesis, literally meaning "across generation",&lt;ref name="O.E.D."&gt;Oxford English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; is extensively used in [[geology]]. However, this term has filtered into the field of [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]] and [[paleontology]] to describe the changes and alterations that take place on skeletal (biological) material. Specifically, diagenesis "is the cumulative physical, chemical and biological environment; these processes will modify an organic object's original chemical and/or structural properties and will govern its ultimate fate, in terms of preservation or destruction".&lt;ref name = "Wilson"&gt;Wilson, L. and M. Pollard, "Here today, gone tomorrow? Integrated experimentation and geochemical modeling in studies of archaeological diagenetic change".

The composite nature of bone, comprising one-third organic (mainly [[protein]] [[collagen]]) and two thirds mineral ([[calcium phosphate]] mostly in the form of [[hydroxyapatite]]) renders its diagenesis more complex.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholson | first1 = R.

# chemical deterioration of the organic phase.
# chemical deterioration of the mineral phase.
# (micro) biological attack of the composite.&lt;ref name = "Collins"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collins | first1 = M. J. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2002 | title = The Survival of Organic Matter in Bone: A Review | url = | journal = Archaeometry | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 383–394 | doi=10.1111/1475-4754.t01-1-00071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are as follows:
# The [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] of collagen depends on time, temperature and environmental pH.&lt;ref name = "Collins"/&gt; At high temperatures, the rate of collagen loss will be accelerated and extreme [[pH]] can cause collagen swelling and accelerated [[hydrolysis]].&lt;ref name = "Collins"/&gt; Due to the increase in [[porosity]] of bones through collagen loss, the bone becomes susceptible to hydrolytic [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] where the hydroxyapatite, with its affinity for [[amino acids]], permits charged species of [[endogenous]] and [[exogenous]] origin to take up residence.&lt;ref name = "Hedges"/&gt;
# The [[hydrolytic]] activity plays a key role in the mineral phase transformations that exposes the collagen to accelerated chemical- and bio-degradation.&lt;ref name = "Collins"/&gt; Chemical changes affect [[crystallinity]].&lt;ref name = "Hedges"/&gt; Mechanisms of chemical change, such as the uptake of F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; may cause [[recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] where hydroxyapatite is dissolved and re-[[precipitated]] allowing for the incorporation of substitution of exogenous material.&lt;ref name = "Hedges"/&gt;
# Once an individual has been [[interred]], microbial attack, the most common mechanism of bone deterioration, occurs rapidly.&lt;ref name = "Collins"/&gt; During this phase, most bone collagen is lost and porosity is increased.&lt;ref name = "Hedges"/&gt; The dissolution of the mineral phase caused by low [[pH]] permits access to the collagen by extracellular microbial enzymes thus microbial attack.&lt;ref name = "Collins"/&gt;

== Role of diagenesis in hydrocarbon generation ==
When animal or plant matter is buried during sedimentation, the constituent organic [[molecule]]s ([[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s and [[lignin]]-[[Humus|humic]] compounds) break down due to the increase in [[temperature]] and [[pressure]]. This transformation occurs in the first few hundred meters of burial and results in the creation of two primary products: [[kerogen]]s and [[bitumen]]s.

It is generally accepted that hydrocarbons are formed by the thermal alteration of these kerogens (the ''biogenic'' theory). In this way, given certain conditions (which are largely temperature-dependent) kerogens will break down to form hydrocarbons through a chemical process known as [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]], or [[Catagenesis (geology)|catagenesis]].

A kinetic model based on experimental data can capture most of the essential transformation in diagenesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abercrombie | first1 = H. J. | last2 = Hutcheon | first2 = I. E. | last3 = Bloch | first3 = J. D. | last4 = Caritat | first4 = P. | year = 1994 | title = Silica activity and the smectite-illite reaction | url = | journal = Geology | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 539–542 | doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1994)022&lt;0539:saatsi&gt;2.3.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a mathematical model in a compacting porous medium to model the dissolution-precipitation mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fowler | first1 = A. C. | last2 = Yang | first2 = X. S. | year = 2003 | title = Dissolution/precipitation mechanisms for diagenesis in sedimentary basins | url = | journal = J. Geophys.

Diagenesis has been divided, based on hydrocarbon and coal genesis into: ''eodiagenesis'' (early), ''mesodiagenesis'' (middle) and ''telodiagenesis'' (late). During the early or eodiagenesis stage shales lose pore water, little to no hydrocarbons are formed and [[coal]] varies between [[lignite]] and [[sub-bituminous]]. During mesodiagenesis, dehydration of [[clay mineral]]s occurs, the main development of oil genesis occurs and high to low volatile [[bituminous coal]]s are formed. During telodiagenesis, organic matter undergoes [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] and dry gas is produced; semi-[[anthracite]] coals develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foscolos | first1 = A. E. | last2 = Powell | first2 = T. G. | last3 = Gunther | first3 = P. R. | year = 1976 | title = The use of clay minerals and inorganic and organic geochemical indicators for evaluating the degree of diagenesis and oil generating potential of shales | doi = 10.1016/0016-7037(76)90144-7 | journal = Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta | volume = 40 | issue = 8| pages = 953–966 | bibcode = 1976GeCoA..40..953F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early diagenesis in newly formed aquatic sediments is mediated by microorganisms using different electron acceptors as part of their metabolism. Organic matter is mineralized, liberating gaseous [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the porewater, which, depending on the conditions, can diffuse into the water column. The various processes of mineralization in this phase are [[nitrification]] and [[denitrification]], [[manganese]] oxide reduction, [[iron]] hydroxide reduction, [[sulfate reduction]], and [[fermentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lovley | first1 = D. R. | year = 1991 | title = Dissimilatory Fe(II) and Mn(IV) reduction | url = | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 259–287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of diagenesis in bone decomposition ==
Diagenesis alters the proportions of organic collagen and inorganic components (hydroxyapatite, calcium, magnesium) of bone exposed to environmental conditions, especially moisture. This is accomplished by the exchange of natural bone constituents, deposition in voids or defects, adsorption onto the bone surface and leaching from the bone.&lt;ref name="Hedges"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Beyond the grave: understanding human decomposition" A. A. Vass ''Microbiology Today'' 2001 [http://pathstoknowledge.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/beyond-the-grave-understanding-human-decomposition-no-photos-v1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In aeronautics, '''downwash''' is the change in direction of air deflected by the aerodynamic action of an [[airfoil]],  [[wing]] or [[helicopter rotor blade]] in motion, as part of the process of producing [[Lift (force)|lift]].&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', page 172. Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56027-287-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lift on airfoil is an example of application of [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's third law of motion]] - the force required to create the downwash is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the lift force on the airfoil. Lift on an airfoil is also an example of the [[Kutta-Joukowski theorem]] – the [[Kutta condition]] explains the existence of downwash at the [[trailing edge]] of the wing.&lt;ref name="Crane" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson_Flight_5.19"&gt;{{Citation

'''Energix Renewable Energies Ltd.''' is a power producer specializing in [[renewable energy]], currently active mainly in the field of [[Photovoltaics]] and [[Wind power]]. Energiesis a public company traded in the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]] since May 2011 ({{TASE|ENRG}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = אנרג'יקס {{!}} Energix Group - Creating Your Green Energy|url = http://www.energix-group.com/|website = www.energix-group.com|accessdate = 2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energix is owned (72%) by Alony Hetz Properties and Investments Ltd. (TASE: "ALHE”), one of the largest real-estate investment group in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Globes Dun’s 100 - Alony-Hetz Properties and Investments Ltd. |url=http://duns100.globes.co.il/en/companies-1000871596 |website=duns100.globes.co.il |accessdate=2015-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015005043/http://duns100.globes.co.il/en/companies-1000871596 |archivedate=2015-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Energix was founded in 2009 as a fully owned subsidiary of Amot Investments Ltd. (TASE: "AMOT”), the Israeli real estate subsidiary of Alony Hetz, under the name of Amot Energy Ltd. Energix made its first steps by installing "small scaled" (50 KWp) roof-top PV systems on industrial parks buildings owned by Amot industrial parks.

In 2010 Energix began developing "medium scaled" projects both on assets owned by Amot as well as through assets owned by its partnership it established with the Granot group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Israeli solar company looks to Africa, US for opportunities|url = http://en.ofweek.com/news/Israeli-solar-company-looks-to-Africa-US-for-opportunities-29677|website = OFweek News|accessdate = 2015-12-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, after an 11 month construction period,  Energix has connected the [[Neot Hovav]] 37.5 MWp solar park. It was the first and largest Grid Connected PV Solar Park in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Israel's biggest solar farm to be set in Ramat Hovav|url = http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4186172,00.html|accessdate = 2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Energix completes 37.5-MW solar park in Israel - SeeNews Renewables|url = http://renewables.seenews.com/news/energix-completes-37-5-mw-solar-park-in-israel-455358|website = renewables.seenews.com|accessdate = 2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ‘Israel’s dump’ now trailblazer for a better environment|url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/israels-dump-now-trailblazer-for-a-better-environment/|website = The Times of Israel|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Projects {{!}} סולאיר ישראל|url = http://www.solaer.co.il/en/projects/|website = www.solaer.co.il|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Energix completed the construction of a [[wind farm]] with a capacity of 50MW in [[Poland]]. It is the first stage out of a total capacity of 192MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tech Nation / Energix buys Polish wind farm project - Tech Nation|url = http://www.haaretz.com/business/tech-roundup/.premium-1.650740|website = Haaretz.com|accessdate = 2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Regulation constricting renewable energy in Israel - Globes English |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-regulations-constricting-renewable-energy-in-israel-1000957570 |website=Globes |accessdate=2015-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927170420/http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-regulations-constricting-renewable-energy-in-israel-1000957570 |archivedate=2015-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tech Nation / Energix buys Polish wind farm project - Tech Nation|url = http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/tech-roundup/.premium-1.650740|website = Haaretz.com|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energix is the winner of "The most Innovative Renewable Energy Company Award" for 2015 of The New Economy Magazine.  It is the first Israeli company to win an award in the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TNE Awards 2015|url = http://www.theneweconomy.com/awards/2015|website = www.theneweconomy.com|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energix' involvement in a project involves financing, gathering regulatory approval, subcontractor management and upon completion of the project, ownership, maintenance and operations of the site.

Energix is located in the [[Moshe Aviv Tower]], [[Ramat Gan]], and currently employs around 25 employees.

In any of these forms, fatty acids are both important dietary sources of fuel for animals and they are important structural components for [[Cell (biology)|cells]].

==History==
The concept of fatty acid (''acide gras'') was introduced by [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]],&lt;ref&gt;Chevreul, M. E. (1813). Sur plusieurs corps gras, et particulièrement sur leurs combinaisons avec les alcalis. ''Annales de Chimie'', t. 88, p. 225-261. [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65741176/f225.item link (Gallica)], [https://books.google.com/books?id=8-sYI8xfBGMC link (Google)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chevreul, M. E. ''Recherches sur les corps gras d'origine animale''. Levrault, Paris, 1823. [https://books.google.com/books?id=r46rnl27h70C link].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leray, C. Chronological history of lipid center. ''Cyberlipid Center''. Last updated on 11 November 2017. [http://www.cyberlipid.org/cyberlip/home0001.htm link].&lt;/ref&gt; though he used initially some variant terms, ''graisse acide'' and ''acide huileux'' ("acid fat" and "oily acid").&lt;ref&gt;Menten, P. ''Dictionnaire de chimie: Une approche étymologique et historique''. De Boeck, Bruxelles. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NKTKDgAAQBAJ link].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Length of fatty acids===
Fatty acids differ by length, often categorized as short to very long. 
*[[Short-chain fatty acid]]s (SCFA) are fatty acids with [[aliphatic]] tails of five or fewer [[carbon]]s (e.g. [[butyric acid]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foodomics: Advanced Mass Spectrometry in Modern Food Science and Nutrition|isbn=9781118169452|editor-last= Cifuentes|editor-first=Alejandro|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013|chapter=Microbial Metabolites in the Human Gut|date=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saturated fatty acids===
{{Main|Saturated fat}}
{{Main list|List of saturated fatty acids}}
Saturated fatty acids have no C=C double bonds. They have the same formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;COOH, with variations in "n". An important saturated fatty acid is [[stearic acid]] (n = 16), which when neutralized with lye is the most common form of [[soap]].

===Unsaturated fatty acids===
{{main|Unsaturated fat}}
Unsaturated fatty acids have one or more C=C [[double bond]]s. The C=C double bonds can give either [[Cis-trans isomerism|''cis'' or ''trans'']]  isomers.  

; ''cis'' : A ''cis'' configuration means that the two hydrogen atoms adjacent to the double bond stick out on the same side of the chain. The rigidity of the double bond freezes its conformation and, in the case of the ''cis'' isomer, causes the chain to bend and restricts the conformational freedom of the fatty acid. The more double bonds the chain has in the ''cis'' configuration, the less flexibility it has. When a chain has many ''cis'' bonds, it becomes quite curved in its most accessible conformations. For example, [[oleic acid]], with one double bond, has a "kink" in it, whereas [[linoleic acid]], with two double bonds, has a more pronounced bend. [[Alpha-linolenic acid|α-Linolenic acid]], with three double bonds, favors a hooked shape. The effect of this is that, in restricted environments, such as when fatty acids are part of a phospholipid in a lipid bilayer, or triglycerides in lipid droplets, cis bonds limit the ability of fatty acids to be closely packed, and therefore can affect the melting temperature of the membrane or of the fat.
; ''trans'' : A ''trans'' configuration, by contrast, means that the adjacent two hydrogen atoms lie on ''opposite'' sides of the chain. As a result, they do not cause the chain to bend much, and their shape is similar to straight saturated fatty acids.

In most naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids, each double bond has three ''n'' carbon atoms after it, for some '''n''', and all are cis bonds. Most fatty acids in the ''trans'' configuration ([[trans fat]]s) are not found in nature and are the result of human processing (e.g., [[hydrogenation]]).

The differences in geometry between the various types of unsaturated fatty acids, as well as between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, play an important role in biological processes, and in the construction of biological structures (such as cell membranes).

==Nomenclature==

===Numbering of the carbon atoms in a fatty acid===
[[File:Fatty acid numbering.png|thumb|upright=2|Numbering of carbon atoms]]
[[Essential fatty acid#Nomenclature and terminology|The position of the carbon atoms]] in a fatty acid can be indicated from the COOH- (or carboxy) end, or from the –CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (or methyl) end. If indicated from the -COOH end, then the C-1, C-2, C-3, ….(etc.) notation is used (blue numerals in the diagram on the right, where C-1 is the –COOH carbon). If the position is counted from the other, –CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, end then the position is indicated by the ω-''n'' notation (numerals in red, where ω-1 refers to the methyl carbon).

The positions of the double bonds in a fatty acid chain can, therefore, be indicated in two ways, using the C-''n'' or the ω-''n'' notation. Thus, in an 18 carbon fatty acid, a double bond between C-12 (or ω-7) and C-13 (or ω-6) is reported either as Δ&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; if counted from the –COOH end (indicating only the “beginning” of the double bond), or as ω-6 (or omega-6) if counting from the –CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; end. The “Δ” is the Greek letter “delta”, which translates into “D” ( for '''D'''ouble bond) in the Roman alphabet. Omega (ω) is the last letter in the Greek alphabet, and is therefore used to indicate the “last” carbon atom in the fatty acid chain. Since the ω-''n'' notation is used almost exclusively to indicate the positions of the double bonds close to the –CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; end in [[essential fatty acid]]s, there is no necessity for an equivalent “Δ”-like notation - the use of the “ω-''n''” notation always refers to the position of a double bond.

Fatty acids with an [[odd number]] of carbon atoms are called [[odd-chain fatty acid]]s, whereas the rest are even-chain fatty acids. The difference is [[gluconeogenesis#Precursors|relevant to gluconeogenesis]].

===Naming of fatty acids===
The following table describes the most common systems of naming fatty acids.

{{Clear}}
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!System
!Example
!Explanation
|-
!Trivial nomenclature
|[[Palmitoleic acid]]
|'''[[Trivial name]]s''' (or '''common names''') are non-systematic historical names, which are the most frequent naming system used in literature. Most common fatty acids have trivial names in addition to their ''systematic names'' (see below). These names frequently do not follow any pattern, but they are concise and often unambiguous.
|-
!Systematic nomenclature
|[[Oleic acid|(9''Z'')-octadec-9-enoic acid]]
|'''[[Systematic name]]s''' (or '''[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] names''') derive from the standard ''[[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC Rules for the Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry]]'', published in 1979,&lt;ref name="nomenclature-1979"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry |last1=Rigaudy|first1= J. |last2=Klesney|first2=S. P. |publisher=[[Pergamon]] |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-08-022369-8 |oclc=5008199}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a recommendation published specifically for lipids in 1977.&lt;ref name="nomenclature-1977"&gt;{{cite journal |year=1977 |title=The Nomenclature of Lipids. Recommendations, 1976 |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=11–21 |doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1977.tb11778.x  |journal=[[European Journal of Biochemistry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counting begins from the [[carboxylic acid]] end. [[Double bond]]s are labelled with ''[[cis-trans isomerism|cis]]''-/''[[cis-trans isomerism|trans]]''- notation or ''[[E-Z notation|E]]''-/''[[E-Z notation|Z]]''- notation, where appropriate.  This notation is generally more verbose than common nomenclature, but has the advantage of being more technically clear and descriptive.
|-
!Δ&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; nomenclature
|[[Linoleic acid|''cis'',''cis''-Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;,Δ&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; octadecadienoic acid]]
|In '''Δ&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;''' (or '''delta-''x''''') '''nomenclature''', each double bond is indicated by Δ&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, where the double bond is located on the ''x''th carbon–carbon bond, counting from the carboxylic acid end. Each double bond is preceded by a ''[[cis-trans isomerism|cis]]''- or ''[[cis-trans isomerism|trans]]''- prefix, indicating the configuration of the molecule around the bond. For example, [[linoleic acid]] is designated "''cis''-Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, ''cis''-Δ&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; octadecadienoic acid".  This nomenclature has the advantage of being less verbose than systematic nomenclature, but is no more technically clear or descriptive.{{citation needed|reason=citation needed for this verbose delta notation, sometimes in chemical it's seen simpler notation with single delta, locants in superscript comma-separated, for various types of unsaturated natural organic compounds |date=September 2018}}
|-
!''n''−''x'' nomenclature
|[[Omega-3 fatty acid|''n''−3]]
|'''''n''−''x''''' ('''''n'' minus ''x'''''; also '''ω−''x''''' or '''omega-''x''''') '''nomenclature''' both provides names for individual compounds and classifies them by their likely biosynthetic properties in animals. A double bond is located on the ''x''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; carbon–carbon bond, counting from the terminal [[methyl]] carbon (designated as ''n'' or ω) toward the [[carbonyl]] carbon. For example, [[alpha-linolenic acid|α-Linolenic acid]] is classified as a [[omega-3 fatty acid|''n''−3]] or [[omega-3]] fatty acid, and so it is likely to share a biosynthetic pathway with other compounds of this type. The ω−''x'', omega-''x'', or "omega" notation is common in popular nutritional literature, but [[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC]] has deprecated it in favor of ''n''−''x'' notation in technical documents.&lt;ref name="nomenclature-1979" /&gt; The most commonly researched fatty acid biosynthetic pathways are [[omega-3 fatty acid|''n''−3]] and [[omega-6 fatty acid|''n''−6]].

=== {{anchor|Free fatty acids}} Free fatty acids===
When [[circulatory system|circulating]] in the [[blood plasma|plasma]] (plasma fatty acids) are not in their [[ester]], fatty acids are known as non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) or free fatty acids (FFAs). FFAs are always bound to a [[transport protein]], such as [[albumin]].&lt;ref name="Dorlands"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |url=http://dorlands.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

===Industrial===
Fatty acids are usually produced industrially by the [[hydrolysis]] of [[triglyceride]]s, with the removal of [[glycerol]] (see [[oleochemical]]s).  [[Phospholipid]]s represent another source. Some fatty acids are produced synthetically by [[carbonylation|hydrocarboxylation]] of alkenes.{{says whom?}}

===By animals===
{{main|Fatty acid synthesis}}
In animals, fatty acids are formed from carbohydrates predominantly in the [[liver]], [[adipose tissue]], and the  [[mammary glands]] during lactation.&lt;ref name=stryer&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=Biochemistry |chapter= Fatty acid metabolism. |edition= 4th |location= New York |publisher= W. H. Freeman and Company|date= 1995 |pages= 603–628 |isbn= 978-0-7167-2009-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbohydrates are converted into [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] by [[glycolysis]] as the first important step in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; Pyruvate is then decarboxylated to form [[acetyl-CoA]] in the [[mitochondrion]]. However, this acetyl CoA  needs to be transported into [[cytosol]] where the synthesis of fatty acids occurs. This cannot occur directly. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, [[Citric acid|citrate]] (produced by the condensation of acetyl-CoA with [[Oxaloacetic acid|oxaloacetate]]) is removed from the [[citric acid cycle]] and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; There it is cleaved by [[ATP citrate lyase]] into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate is returned to the mitochondrion as [[malate]].&lt;ref name= ferre&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000100426 | title = SREBP-1c Transcription Factor and Lipid Homeostasis: Clinical Perspective | journal = Hormone Research | year = 2007 | first = P. | last = Ferre |first2=F. |last2=Foufelle | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 72–82| pmid = 17344645 | url = http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowFulltext&amp;ArtikelNr=100426&amp;Ausgabe=232805&amp;ProduktNr=224036 | accessdate = 2010-08-30 | quote = this process is outlined graphically in page 73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cytosolic acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by [[acetyl CoA carboxylase]] into [[malonyl-CoA]], the first committed step  in the  synthesis of fatty acids.&lt;ref name= ferre /&gt;&lt;ref name=Voet&gt;{{cite book |last=Voet |first=Donald |first2=Judith G. |last2=Voet |first3=Charlotte W.|last3= Pratt  |title=Fundamentals of Biochemistry|edition= 2nd |publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2006 |pages=547, 556 |isbn=978-0-471-21495-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malonyl-CoA is then involved in a repeating series of reactions that lengthens the growing fatty acid chain by two carbons at a time. Almost all natural fatty acids, therefore, have even numbers of carbon atoms. When synthesis is  complete the free fatty acids are nearly always combined with glycerol (three fatty acids to one glycerol molecule) to form [[triglyceride]]s, the main storage form of fatty acids, and thus of energy in animals. However, fatty acids are also important components of the [[phospholipid]]s that form the [[phospholipid bilayers]] out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed (the [[cell wall]], and the membranes that enclose all the [[organelles]] within the cells, such as the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], the [[mitochondria]], [[endoplasmic reticulum]], and the [[Golgi apparatus]]).&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

The "uncombined fatty acids" or "free fatty acids" found in the circulation of animals come from the breakdown (or [[lipolysis]]) of stored [[triglyceride]]s.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zechner | first1 = R. | last2 = Strauss | first2 = J.

Lipidol. | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 333–340 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because they are insoluble in water, these fatty acids are transported bound to plasma [[albumin]]. The levels of "free fatty acids" in the blood are limited by the availability of albumin binding sites. They can be taken up from the blood by all cells that have mitochondria (with the exception of the cells of the [[central nervous system]]). Fatty acids can only be broken down in mitochondria, by means of [[beta-oxidation]] followed by further combustion in the [[citric acid cycle]] to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water. Cells in the central nervous system, which, although they possess mitochondria, cannot take free fatty acids up from the blood, as the [[blood-brain barrier]] is impervious to most free fatty acids,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} excluding [[short-chain fatty acid]]s and  [[medium-chain fatty acid]]s.&lt;ref name="SCFA MCT-mediated BBB passage - 2005 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsuji A | title = Small molecular drug transfer across the blood-brain barrier via carrier-mediated transport systems | journal = NeuroRx | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–62 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15717057 | pmc = 539320 | doi = 10.1602/neurorx.2.1.54 | quote = Uptake of valproic acid was reduced in the presence of medium-chain fatty acids such as hexanoate, octanoate, and decanoate, but not propionate or butyrate, indicating that valproic acid is taken up into the brain via a transport system for medium-chain fatty acids, not short-chain fatty acids.&amp;nbsp;...

==Reactions of fatty acids==
Fatty acids exhibit reactions like other carboxylic acids, i.e. they undergo [[esterification]] and acid-base reactions.

===Acidity===
Fatty acids do not show a great variation in their acidities, as indicated by their respective [[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]].  [[Nonanoic acid]], for example, has a p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of 4.96, being only slightly weaker than acetic acid (4.76).  As the chain length increases, the solubility of the fatty acids in water decreases, so that the longer-chain fatty acids have minimal effect on the [[pH]] of an aqueous solution.  Even those fatty acids that are insoluble in water will dissolve in warm [[ethanol]], and can be [[titration|titrated]] with [[sodium hydroxide]] solution using [[phenolphthalein]] as an indicator.  This analysis is used to determine the free fatty acid content of fats; i.e., the proportion of the triglycerides that have been [[hydrolysis|hydrolyze]]d.

Neutralization of fatty acids, i.e. [[saponification]], is a widely practiced route to [[metallic soap]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Klaus Schumann, Kurt Siekmann|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a24_247|isbn=978-3527306732|chapter=Soaps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrogenation and hardening===
[[Hydrogenation]] of unsaturated fatty acids is widely practiced. Typical conditions involve 2.0–3.0 MPa of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure, 150&amp;nbsp;°C, and nickel supported on silica as a catalyst.  This treatment affords saturated fatty acids.  The extent of hydrogenation is indicated by the [[iodine number]].  Hydrogenated fatty acids are less prone toward [[rancidification]].  Since the saturated fatty acids are [[melting point|higher melting]] than the unsaturated precursors, the process is called hardening. Related technology is used to convert vegetable oils into [[margarine]]. The hydrogenation of triglycerides (vs fatty acids) is advantageous because the carboxylic acids degrade the nickel catalysts, affording nickel soaps. During partial hydrogenation, unsaturated fatty acids can be isomerized from ''cis'' to ''trans'' configuration.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann|last=Anneken|first=David J.|displayauthors=etal|title=Fatty Acids|DOI=10.1002/14356007.a10_245.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More forcing hydrogenation, i.e. using higher pressures of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and higher temperatures, converts fatty acids into [[fatty alcohol]]s.  Fatty alcohols are, however, more easily produced from fatty acid [[ester]]s.

In the [[Varrentrapp reaction]] certain unsaturated fatty acids are cleaved in molten alkali, a reaction at one time of relevance to structure elucidation.

===Auto-oxidation and rancidity===
{{Main|Rancidification}}
Unsaturated fatty acids undergo a chemical change known as [[auto-oxidation]]. The process requires oxygen (air) and is accelerated by the presence of trace metals. Vegetable oils resist this process to a small degree because they contain antioxidants, such as [[tocopherol]].  Fats and oils often are treated with [[chelation|chelating agents]] such as [[citric acid]] to remove the metal catalysts.

===Ozonolysis===
Unsaturated fatty acids are susceptible to degradation by ozone.  This reaction is practiced in the production of [[azelaic acid]] ((CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from [[oleic acid]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

===Analysis===
In chemical analysis, fatty acids are separated by gas chromatography of methyl esters; additionally, a separation of unsaturated isomers is possible by argentation thin-layer chromatography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/chromsci/25.7.302| pmid = 3611285| title = Separation of Fatty Acids or Methyl Esters Including Positional and Geometric Isomers by Alumina Argentation Thin-Layer Chromatography| journal = Journal of Chromatographic Science| volume = 25| issue = 7| pages = 302–6| year = 1987| last1 = Breuer | first1 = B.| last2 = Stuhlfauth | first2 = T.| last3 = Fock | first3 = H. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circulation==

===Digestion and intake===
{{Main|Digestion#Fat digestion}}
[[Short-chain fatty acid|Short-]] and [[medium-chain fatty acids]] are absorbed directly into the blood via intestine capillaries and travel through the [[portal vein]] just as other absorbed nutrients do. However, [[long-chain fatty acids]] are not directly released into the intestinal capillaries. Instead they are absorbed into the fatty walls of the intestine [[Intestinal villus|villi]] and reassembled again into [[triglyceride]]s. The triglycerides are coated with [[cholesterol]] and protein (protein coat) into a compound called a [[chylomicron]].

From within the cell, the chylomicron is released into a [[lymphatic]] capillary called a [[lacteal]], which merges into larger lymphatic vessels. It is transported via the lymphatic system and the [[thoracic duct]] up to a location near the heart (where the arteries and veins are larger). The thoracic duct empties the chylomicrons into the bloodstream via the left [[subclavian vein]]. At this point the chylomicrons can transport the triglycerides to tissues where they are stored or metabolized for energy.

===Metabolism===
{{Main|Fatty acid metabolism}}
When metabolized, fatty acids yield large quantities of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. Many cell types can use either [[glucose]] or fatty acids for this purpose. Fatty acids (provided either by ingestion or by drawing on triglycerides stored in fatty tissues) are distributed to cells to serve as a fuel for muscular contraction and general metabolism. They are broken down to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water by the intra-cellular [[mitochondria]], releasing large amounts of energy, captured in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] through [[beta oxidation]] and the [[citric acid cycle]].

====Essential fatty acids====
{{Main|Essential fatty acid}}
Fatty acids that are required for good health but cannot be made in sufficient quantity from other substrates, and therefore must be obtained from food, are called essential fatty acids. There are two series of essential fatty acids: one has a double bond [[Omega-3 fatty acid|three carbon atoms]] away from the methyl end; the other has a double bond [[Omega-6 fatty acid|six carbon atoms]] away  from the methyl end. Humans lack the ability to introduce double bonds in fatty acids beyond carbons 9 and 10, as counted from the carboxylic acid side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolsover|first=Stephen R.|title=Cell Biology: A Short Course|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3a6p9pA5gZ8C&amp;pg=PA42+|date=15 February 2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-46159-3|pages=42ff|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two essential fatty acids are [[linoleic acid]] (LA) and [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (ALA). These fatty acids are widely distributed in plant oils. The human body has a limited ability to convert ALA into the longer-chain [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s — [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA), which can also be obtained from fish. Omega-3 and [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] fatty acids are [[Biosynthesis|biosynthetic]] precursors to [[Cannabinoid#Endocannabinoids|endocannabinoids]] with [[Nociception|antinociceptive]], [[anxiolytic]], and [[Nervous system|neurogenic]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramsden|first=Christopher E.|last2=Zamora|first2=Daisy|last3=Makriyannis|first3=Alexandros|last4=Wood|first4=JodiAnne T.|last5=Mann|first5=J.

===Distribution===
{{Main|Blood fatty acids}}
Blood fatty acids are in different forms in different stages in the blood circulation. They are taken in through the intestine in [[chylomicron]]s, but also exist in [[very low density lipoprotein]]s (VLDL) and [[low density lipoprotein]]s (LDL) after processing in the liver. In addition, when released from [[adipocytes]], fatty acids exist in the blood as [[free fatty acids]].

It is proposed that the blend of fatty acids exuded by mammalian skin, together with [[lactic acid]] and [[pyruvic acid]], is distinctive and enables animals with a keen sense of smell to differentiate individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial uses==
Fatty acids are mainly used in the production of [[soap]], both for cosmetic purposes and, in the case of [[metallic soap]]s, as lubricants.  Fatty acids are also converted, via their methyl esters, to [[fatty alcohol]]s and [[fatty amine]]s, which are precursors to surfactants, detergents, and lubricants.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; Other applications include their use as  [[Emulsion#Emulsifiers|emulsifiers]], texturizing agents, wetting agents, [[Defoamer|anti-foam agents]], or stabilizing agents.&lt;ref name="buildingblocks"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aciscience.org/docs/Fatty_Acids_Building_Blocks_for_Industry.pdf | title= Fatty Acids: Building Blocks for Industry | access-date=22 Apr 2018 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=aciscience.org |publisher= American Cleaning Institute |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Esters of fatty acids with simpler alcohols (such as methyl-, ethyl-, n-propyl-, isopropyl- and butyl esters) are used as emollients in cosmetics and other personal care products and as synthetic lubricants. Esters of fatty acids with more complex alcohols, such as [[sorbitol]], [[ethylene glycol]], [[diethylene glycol]], and [[polyethylene glycol]] are consumed in food, or used for personal care and water treatment, or used as synthetic lubricants or fluids for metal working.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2910">The '''Fender Reverb Unit''' (6G15) was a [[vacuum tube]], spring [[reverb]]-equipped [[effects unit]] made by [[Fender Musical Instrument Corporation|Fender]]. The Reverb Unit was originally introduced in 1961. It was discontinued in 1966 and was replaced by a solid-state model, the FR1000.&lt;ref name="Teagle" /&gt; The unit features three controls: Dwell, Mixer and Tone and includes a [[12AT7]] tube as a [[preamplifier]]; a 6K6 tube as the reverb driver; and a [[12AX7]] as the reverb recovery tube.  The rectifier is a diode-type solid state unit.  The circuit board, like Fender's [[Fender_amplifier#Brownface_(Brown_and_Blonde)|Brownface]], [[Fender_amplifier#Blackface|Blackface]] and [[Fender_amplifier#Silverface|Silverface]] amplifiers is an eyelet board and the unit its completely hand wired.  The spring reverb “tank” is mounted on the interior side of the front baffle in a vertical position. Tanks were supplied by Gibbs and Accutronics in the original version. The vertically mounted tank should be a 4AB3C1C (last letter in Accutronics model designation indicates tank orientation) but most actually shipped with 4AB3C1B tanks which are designed for horizontal mounting; these are the same ones found in the Fender combo amps where it is mounted of the floor in a horizontal configuration. Physically, the unit looks like a small amplifier head and since the early 1960s the unit has become synonymous with surf music.

==1976–1978==
The tube reverb was reintroduced in 1976 with a silver control panel ("Silverface"). It was discontinued in 1978.&lt;ref name="Teagle"&gt;Teagle, J. and Sprung, J.: ''Fender Amps: The First Fifty Years''.&lt;/ref&gt; This reissue differs significantly from the original 6G15 circuit. The unit has 4 tubes: V1 (Input/preamplifier, a 12AX7 as opposed to a 12AT7 in the earlier three-tube version), V2 (reverb driver, a [[6V6]] as opposed to a 6K6 in the original), V3 (reverb recovery, a 12AX7), and V4 (a buffer stage, using another 12AX7). V4 acts to reduce changes in output impedance when the wet-dry mix is varied, ameliorating the “tone suck” (loss of volume and some high frequency signal) seen with the original and later reissue 3 tube versions.

==Reissue (1994)==
A reissue of the original tube reverb was introduced in 1994. Some changes in the circuit were made to accommodate a 6V6 reverb driver tube, replacing the obsolete 6K6.  Reissues also have two printed circuit boards (potentiometers are mounted on the smaller of the two) and a mix of hand wiring and spade connectors.  It is available with [[White (Fender)|white]], [[Blackface (Fender)|black]] or [[Brown (Fender)|brown]] tolex. Fender also now makes a tweed-covered Reverb Unit to match its [[Fender_amplifier#Tweed_amplifiers|Tweed amplifiers]] of the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Teagle" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1496">The '''Forest Vegetation Simulator''' (FVS) is a [[Growth and yield modelling|forest growth and yield model]] developed by the [[United States Forest Service]] and is used by natural resource managers and researchers. FVS is calibrated for specific geographic areas and uses a host of simulation models to forecast forest composition and structure.

FVS uses current [[forest inventory]] data to describe initial stand conditions and requires a description of the inventory design, stand attributes, and a list of individual tree information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060828203442/http://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/fvs/description/index.shtml What is FVS?"] [http://www.fs.fed.us U.S. Forest Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970708105238/http://www.fs.fed.us/ |date=1997-07-08 }}. Accessed December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions to FVS are available to assess the effects of forest insects and diseases, fire, and forest carbon.

==Model mechanics==
FVS is an empirical forest growth model based on the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots. It models individual tree growth as a function of average stand characteristics. Each of the regional variants is based on FIA plots within the region. The model is designed to produce reasonable approximations of forest growth which agree with the [[-3/2 thinning law]] and a basal area maximum.

===Historical sales 1999-2014===

The following table presents historical hybrid sales figures by vehicle model in the United States since 1999 through December 30, 2014, in order of total historical sales from 1999 to 2014.&lt;ref name=DoEHEV/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sales2011US/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sales2013US/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sales2014US/&gt; Family of vehicles sharing nameplate/marque (i.e. Toyota Prius) or exactly the same powertrain (i.e. Ford Fusion Hybrid and Lincoln MKZ Hybrid) are grouped together.
&lt;!-- WIKI EDITORS NOTE: If updating year-to-date sales, please update the reference link for verification, and the "Total" column for accuracy and consistency.  The table used to be updated monthly, but now the regular editors are trying to do the update at year's end. The next update is scheduled for sales through December 2015.  That said, if other users wish to update the tables monthly, or before the next quarterly cycle, the Hybridcars.com Dashboard (see http://www.hybridcars.com/market-dashboard.html) provides reliable monthly sales reports that can be used for the purpose, and this source is desirable to keep consistency in the series.

==Etymology==
Lungzubel means a rice beer jar or container in the Biate language. The literal meaning of Lungzubel are – 'Lung' means Stone, 'Zu' means Rice beer and 'Bel' means Jar, which comes together as “Stone Rice Beer Jar”.

==History==
Lungzubels are one of the historical treasures of the Biate tribe. However, the origin of the Lungzubels remains shrouded in obscurity. According to [[Biate people|Biate]] legends and elders, erection and carving of stone monuments has been the cultural practice of the Biate tribe from time immemorial, the most popular among them viz. the Lungzubels, Lungmaicham (stone altar), etc. These stone monuments or relics are generally a pictogram of a successful or triumphant Biate chief or warriors who gained honour in the past. Moreover, the fact that rice beer used to play an important role in the rituals and festivals of the Biates in the past throw much light on why the Lungzubels were carved out. One theory also holds that these stone jars are the handiwork of Lamlira, a legendary Biate warrior who led the Biates to their present hills believed to be in the 12-13th century.&lt;ref name=Pakem&gt;{{Cite book| title=The Biate. In, The Tribes of North East India (Edt. by Sebastian Karotemprel) | author=Pakem, B. | year=1998 | pages=289–301 | edition= | publisher=Centre for Indigenous Cultures| location=Shillong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Lungzubels are not confined to a particular place but are spread out in all Biate inhabited areas in the southwestern part of Dima Hasao district and the adjoining state of Meghalaya across the Kangkalang ([[Kopili River|Kopili]]) river mainly in the [[Saipung]] Elaka, East Jaintia Hills district. Dr.B.Pakem, a renowned writer and former Vice-Chancellor of [[North Eastern Hill University]] also wrote that these round stones and hollow ground resemble those found in the nearby Sumer Elaka, between Umkyurpong and Kseh villages in Meghalaya. He believed that it might have been the sacrificial or dancing places of the Biates' forefathers in the past. &lt;ref name=Pakem&gt;{{Cite book| title=The Biate. In, The Tribes of North East India (Edt. by Sebastian Karotemprel) | author=Pakem, B. | year=1998 | pages=289–301 | edition= | publisher=Centre for Indigenous Cultures| location=Shillong}}&lt;/ref&gt;In Dima Hasao, the most well-known location is a small Biate village called Khobak, about 130&amp;nbsp;km from the district headquarters [[Haflong]]. Lungzubels are also found in some other areas albeit in small numbers. It is widely believed that these places may also have been inhabited by the Biates in olden days.

[[Image:Lungzubel Meghalaya.JPG|thumb|'''Lungzubels in Saipung, Meghalaya''']]

==Present condition and preservation==
Most of the relics were gradually destroyed over time, by nature or man, as it was left abandoned and unguarded for a long time.It is believed that the advent of Christianity among the Biates in the 19th century could have been the main reason behind the neglect of these cultural treasures as Christianity doesn't encourage intoxicated drinks of any kind. Originally animists, conversion to the new faith may have led the Biates to abandon their age old practice of brewing rice beer which is still a practice among some of their neighboring brethren tribes.

Encouragingly, because of the relentless efforts of the Biate Devanpui (Biate Apex Body) and the Biate Cultural Organization, Assam (BCOA), the importance of the relics and the need for its preservation have been acknowledged, and hence, as a result, Lungzubels around Khobak and its surrounding areas in Dima Hasao district are now being maintained and looked after by the Archaeological Dept. of the Department of Cultural Affairs, Assam. Moreover, with a view to promote tourism in the district as well as to showcase the Lungzubels to the world, Lungzubel festival was also organised by the Biate Cultural Organisation (BCO) of Assam, in collaboration with 22 Sector Assam Rifles, State Tourism Department and Archaeological Department and a Haflong-based NGO named Make a Difference (MaD) Society, on September 16, 2015 at Khobak where thousands of people from all spheres attended the day-long programme that included a pipe band display by the Assam Rifles and traditional dances performed by the local villagers belonging to the Biate community. &lt;ref name=&gt;{{Cite book| title= Assam Tribune| author= | year= September 17, 2015 | page= | edition= | publisher= | location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The steps taken by the Assam Government has been commendable and the Lungzubels are now well looked after.
In the neighboring Meghalaya state, however, no concrete steps have been taken by the Government of Meghalaya to preserve the Lungzubels found in [[East Jaintia Hills]] district as of yet. They continue to be in a state of neglect.

==Connectivity==
Khobak is well connected by an all weather motorable road and one can visit the place at any time of the year. It is located about 130&amp;nbsp;km from Haflong.

'''Modec''' was an [[electric vehicle]] manufacturer in Coventry, in the United Kingdom, specialising in [[Commercial vehicle]]s in the [[Large goods vehicle|N2]] category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/main/wp29/wp29wgs/wp29gen/wp29fdoc/78r1a2e.pdf|title=Transport -  Transport - UNECE|author=|date=|website=www.unece.org|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It unveiled its first model in April 2006 and announced its intention to commence series production in March 2007, with the first production vehicles destined for [[Tesco]]. Following a long-term decline in sales, it entered administration in March 2011, with all remaining assets and intellectual property sold to [[Navistar International]].

==History==
; 2002 : eMercury project commenced within [[London Taxis International]] (a subsidiary of [[Manganese Bronze Holdings]]).  The project was led by Jevon Thorpe, designer of the [[TX1]]London Taxi.  Some development funding received from the Energy Savings Trust (EST), part of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]].

; 2004: Three eMercury prototypes demonstrated - one conventional [[lead-acid battery]] powered, one [[hybrid vehicle]] utilising a [[nickel metal hydride battery]] and one utilising a high energy [[molten salt battery]] mounted in a removable cassette between the [[chassis]] rails.
: [[Manganese Bronze Holdings]] announces its decision to focus on its taxi business. The eMercury project bought by [[Jamie Borwick]], former CEO &amp; Chairman of Manganese Bronze, who creates Modec Limited as part of Borwick Group.
: Splits with drivetrain supplier Azure Dynamics, in favour of [[Zytek]], commences development of production vehicles

; 2006 : Announces partnerships with Lex Logistics for customer service, [[GE Commercial Finance]] for vehicle finance and [[battery rental]] and [[Axeon Power]] for battery cassette assemblies containing [[Zebra battery]] technology.

===Closure===
Following a long-term decline in sales with a total production of around 400 vehicles, and following the failure of a rescue deal with Navistar, Modec entered administration in March 2011 with debts of over £40m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shankleman|first=Jessica|title=Could Modec crash kill off UK's commercial electric vehicle market?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/08/modec-crash-commercial-electric-vehicle|work=The Guardian|accessdate=15 May 2012|date=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navistar subsequently bought the intellectual property rights from administrators [[Zolfo Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/birmingham-business/birmingham-business-news/automotive-business/2011/04/08/modec-electric-van-know-how-sold-to-us-firm-navistar-65233-28486941/|title=Modec electric van know-how sold to US firm Navistar|author=Anna Blackaby|publisher=birminghampost.net|date=8 April 2011|accessdate=2011-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the closure of the business and sale of the assets, [[Liberty Electric Cars]] hired the entire Modec engineering team and set up a new subsidiary "Liberty E-Tech".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/2011/6/2/ex-modec-engineering-team-joins-forces-with-liberty-electric-cars/39721/|title=Ex Modec engineering team joins forces with Liberty Electric Cars|publisher=Fleet News|date=2 June 2011|accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failing in January 2011 to agree a deal with Navistar to buy the brand, in July 2011 Liberty launched a service called "e-Care" to service and maintain Modec vehicles, which presently covers the UK, France, Germany and Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/2011/9/12/liberty-electric-cars-launches-liberty-e-care/40572/|title=Liberty Electric Cars launches Liberty E-Care|publisher=Fleet News|date=12 September 2011|accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical==
The only product of the Modec company was the Modec EV commercial vehicle. It was produced in three versions; a [[chassis cab]], box van and a dropside. All three shared a common wheelbase of {{convert|141.7|in|m|2|abbr=on}} and a steel ladder frame chassis. The Modec has a kerb weight of 3.3 tonnes and a max gross capacity of 6.05 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modec Brochure|url=http://publishing.yudu.com/Freedom/Ac6dq/ModecEVtruckbrochure/resources/index.htm|work=Modec|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vehicles use an {{convert|102|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} motor with {{convert|221|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque and an exchangeable lead-acid battery which is charged from an external charger than requires a 32amp 3-phase supply to charge the vehicle for 6 hours, it also has options for Lithium-Ion Phosphate or Sodium Nickel chloride batteries.

It has a {{Convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} range and a {{Convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} top speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/paulodowd/modec-electric-vehicle Presentation about Modec vehicles form Paul o'Dowd their Nation Sales manager] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622062903/http://www.slideshare.net/paulodowd/modec-electric-vehicle |date=22 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1971 AMC Gremlin AMO 2015 show - all original 6of6.jpg|thumb|upright|An original 1971 [[American Motors]] window sticker listing standard and optional equipment]] 
The '''Monroney sticker''' or '''window sticker''' is a label required in the [[United States]] to be displayed in all new [[automobile]]s and includes the listing of certain official information about the car. The window sticker was named after [[Mike Monroney|Almer Stillwell "Mike" Monroney]], United States Senator from [[Oklahoma]]. Monroney sponsored the [[Automobile Information Disclosure Act of 1958]], which mandated the disclosure of equipment and pricing information on new automobiles.

Since the mid-1970s the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] provides [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] metrics in the label to help consumers choose more fuel efficient vehicles.

New requirements for the Monroney label were issued for 2008 cars and light-duty trucks sold in the US. The 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) mandated inclusion of additional information about fuel efficiency as well as ratings on each vehicle's greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants.&lt;ref name=EPA2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT052511/&gt;

A more comprehensive fuel economy and environment label was mandatory beginning in [[model year]] 2013, though some carmakers adopted it voluntarily for model year 2012. The new window sticker includes specific labels for [[alternative fuel]] and [[alternative propulsion]] vehicles available in the US market, such as [[plug-in hybrid]]s, [[electric vehicle]]s, [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s, [[Fuel cell vehicle|hydrogen fuel cell vehicle]], and [[natural gas vehicle]]s. 

The new label introduces the comparison of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles using [[miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent]] (MPGe) as a metric. Other information provided for the first time includes  [[greenhouse gas]] and [[smog]] [[Motor vehicle emissions|emission]]s ratings, estimates of fuel cost over the next five years, and a [[QR Code]] that can be scanned by a [[smartphone]] to allow users access to additional online information.

The Monroney sticker is required to be affixed to the side [[window]] or [[windshield]] of every new car sold in the United States and can only be removed by the consumer (Chapter 28, Sections 1231-1233, [[Title 15 of the United States Code]]).  A fine of up to {{USD|1,000}} per vehicle for each offense is authorized if the sticker is missing, and other fees and penalties are authorized if the sticker is altered illegally (including imprisonment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=15 U.S. Code § 1233 - Violations and penalties |url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1233 |work=Cornell University |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The act does not apply to vehicles with a [[gross vehicle weight rating]] (GVWR) of more than {{convert|8500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.

The sticker must include the following information:
* The [[Suggested retail price|manufacturer's suggested retail price]] (MSRP)
* Engine and transmission specifications
* Standard equipment and warranty details
* Optional equipment and pricing
* City and highway [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy ratings]], as determined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA)

==Redesigned fuel economy label==
As required by the 2007 [[Energy Independence and Security Act]] (EISA), with the introduction of [[advanced-technology vehicle]]s in the U.S. new information should be incorporated in the [[Monroney label]] of new cars and light-duty trucks sold in the country, such as ratings on [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], [[greenhouse gas emissions]], and other [[air pollutant]]s. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) conducted a series of studies to determine the best way to redesign this label to provide consumers with simple energy and environmental comparisons across all vehicles types, including [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEV), [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s (PHEV), and conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel, in order to help consumers choose more efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles.&lt;ref name=EPAfueleconomy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/|title=Fuel Economy Label|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|date=2011-02-14|accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPAstudy10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/label/420r10909.pdf |title=Environmental Protection Agency Fuel Economy Label - Final Report|author=Office of Transportation and Air Quality, EPA, and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Us DoT|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |date=September 2010|accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nissan Leaf EPA fuel economy label.jpg|thumb|EPA's fuel economy and environmental label for the 2011 [[Nissan Leaf]] [[electric car]]]] 
As part of the research and redesign process, EPA conducted [[focus group]]s where presented participants with several options to express the consumption of electricity for [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s. The research showed that participants did not understand the concept of a [[kilowatt hour]] as a measure of electric energy use in spite of the fact that this is the metric used in their monthly electric bills. Instead, participants favored a [[miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent]], MPGe, as the metric to compare with the familiar miles per gallon used for gasoline vehicles. The research also concluded that the kW-hrs per 100 miles metric was more confusing to focus group participants compared to a miles per kW-hr. Based on these results, EPA decided to use the following fuel economy and fuel consumption metrics on the redesigned labels: MPG (city and highway, and combined); MPGe (city and highway, and combined); Gallons per 100 miles; kW-hrs per 100 miles.&lt;ref name=EPAstudy10/&gt;

The proposed design and final content for two options of the new sticker label that will be introduced in 2013 [[model year]] cars and trucks were consulted for 60 days with the public in 2010, and both included miles per gallon equivalent and kW-hrs per 100 miles as the fuel economy metrics for plug-in cars, but in one option MPGe and annual electricity cost are the two most prominent metrics. One of the design options had a letter grading system from A to D and the rating would have compared a given vehicle’s fuel economy and air pollution to those of the entire fleet of new cars. The letter grade system was opposed by carmakers and rejected after the public consultation.&lt;ref name=NYT052511/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/label/420f10048.pdf|title=EPA and NHTSA Propose Changes to the Motor Vehicle Fuel Economy Label|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |date=August 2010|accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/e-p-a-develops-grading-system-for-new-car-stickers/?scp=1&amp;sq=EPA%20new%20window%20sticker%20letter%20grading&amp;st=cse |title=E.P.A.

==2013 fuel economy and environment label==
[[File:2012 Chevrolet Volt EPA window sticker 0483.jpg|thumb|New design of the EPA/DOE fuel economy and environment label for the 2012 [[Chevrolet Volt]] showing potential fuel cost savings for the [[plug-in hybrid]] and other performance indicators]]  
In May 2011, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) and EPA issued a joint final rule establishing new requirements for a fuel economy and environment label that will be mandatory for all new passenger cars and trucks starting with [[model year]] 2013, though carmakers can adopt it voluntarily for model year 2012. The ruling include new labels for [[alternative fuel]] and [[alternative propulsion]] vehicles available in the US market, such as [[plug-in hybrid]]s, [[electric vehicle]]s, [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s, [[Fuel cell vehicle|hydrogen fuel cell vehicle]], and [[natural gas vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name=EPA2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/carlabel/420f11017.htm|title=Fact Sheet: New Fuel Economy and Environment Labels for a New Generation of Vehicles |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |date=May 2011|accessdate=2011-05-25}} ''EPA-420-F-11-017''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/05/felabel-20110525.html|title=EPA, DOT unveil the next generation of fuel economy labels |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2011-05-25|accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common fuel economy metric adopted to allow the comparison of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles is [[miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent]] (MPGe). A gallon of gasoline equivalent means the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity, cubic feet of [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG), or kilograms of [[hydrogen]] that is equal to the energy in a gallon of gasoline.&lt;ref name=EPA2013/&gt;

The new labels include for the first time an estimate of how much fuel or electricity it takes to drive {{Convert|100|mi}}, providing U.S. consumers with fuel consumption per distance traveled, the efficiency metric commonly used in many other countries. EPA's objective is to avoid the traditional miles per gallon metric that can be potentially misleading when consumers compare fuel economy improvements, and known as the "MPG illusion."&lt;ref name=EPA2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT052511&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/business/energy-environment/26label.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1 |title=New Mileage Stickers Include Greenhouse Gas Data |first=John M. |last=Broder |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2011-05-25|accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other information provided for the first time in the redesigned labels includes:&lt;ref name=GCC2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT052511/&gt;
*[[Greenhouse gas]] ratings of how a model compares to all others for tailpipe emissions of [[carbon dioxide]]. A footnote like note clarifies that upstream emissions from electricity generation are not included.
*[[Smog]] [[Motor vehicle emissions|emission]]s ratings based on air pollutants such as [[nitrogen oxide]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]].
*New ways to compare energy use and cost between new-technology cars that use electricity and conventional cars that are gasoline-powered.
*Estimates on how much more or less consumers will save or spend on fuel over the next five years compared to the average new vehicle.
*Information on the driving range while running in [[all-electric mode]] and charging time for plug-in hybrids and electric cars.
*A [[QR Code]] that can be scanned by a [[smartphone]] to allow users access to online information about how various models compare on fuel economy, the price of gasoline and electricity where the user lives, and other environmental and energy factors. This tool will also allow consumers to enter information about their typical commutes and driving behavior in order to get a more precise estimate of fuel costs and savings.

'''NC State University (Lot 86, Farm Unit 1)''' is a [[Superfund]] site&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/nar467.htm EPA NPL Superfund Site Narrative]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[North Carolina]] located to the north of [[Carter–Finley Stadium]].  It is a {{convert|1.5|acre|m2|adj=on}} site that was used from 1969 until 1980 to dispose of [[hazardous waste]] from laboratories and research facilities.  The [[North Carolina State University]] Department of Marine, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences began monitoring the site in 1981, drilling wells and sampling the [[groundwater]].  [[Groundwater remediation]] is currently being conducted&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/region4/waste/npl/nplnc/ncst86nc.htm EPA Site Summary]&lt;/ref&gt; at the site via pump and treat methods to remove [[chemicals of concern]], including [[chloroform]], [[bromoform]], [[1,1,1-trichloroethane]], and [[methylene chloride]].

"The groundwater remediation system consists of approximately 18 pumping wells that penetrate the contamination.  Special chemical resistant pumps pump the contaminated groundwater to a treatment building above ground.  Air Stripping is the primary form of treatment of the contaminated groundwater.  Once treated, water is pumped to the sewer system for disposal."

A solar farm is currently located on a portion of the site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/region4/superfund/sites/npl/northcarolina/ncstatnc.html#location&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NEG Micon''' is a former [[Denmark|Danish]] [[wind turbine]] manufacturer. It was formed in 1997 as a result of a merger between Nordtank Energy Group (NEG) and Moerup Industrial Windmill Construction Company (Micon).&lt;ref name="agores"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/publications/WETF/Facts_Volume_3.pdf | title=WIND ENERGY - THE FACTS (Volume 3)| publisher=European Commission (Directorate-General for Energy)| accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[company]] was merged with another Danish wind turbine manufacturer, [[Vestas]], in 2004, and it is now operating under that name. The company produced [[wind turbines]] for many different countries including [[Canada]], Denmark, [[Germany]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[United States]].

NEG Micon turbine had 35 different models,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewindpower.net/manufacturer-datasheet-range-41-neg-micon.php Product range of NEG Micon]&lt;/ref&gt; and were very popular in the [[wind power industry]], particularly the ''NM-48'', ''NM-52'', ''NM-72'', and ''NM-82'' turbines; and can be seen throughout major [[wind farm]]s around the world.

'''Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute (NARI)''' is a [[non-governmental organisation]] and non-profit research and development institute in Tambmal, [[Phaltan]], [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. The institute undertakes research and development in the fields of [[agriculture]], [[renewable energy]], [[animal husbandry]] and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/Nimbkar-Agricultural-Research-Institute-125446618328 Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; The institute was founded in 1968 by Shri [[B. V. Nimbkar]], who remained its president until 1990. Dr.[[Anil K. Rajvanshi]] is currently the director of the institute whereas Dr. [[Nandini Nimbkar]] is the president.

==Agriculture==
NARI has developed various [[safflower]] varieties and hybrids for both high oil content and petals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebetterindia.com/30018/hybrid-varieties-of-safflower-revolutionize-agriculture-farmer-income-dry-states These Hybrid Varieties of Safflower Can Shake Up Agriculture and Farmer Income in the Dry States]&lt;/ref&gt; NARI is one of the research centers included in the All India Coordinated Research Project on Oilseeds for irrigated safflower under the aegis of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR, New Delhi).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icar-iior.org.in/index.php/aicrp-centres/safflower]&lt;/ref&gt; The institute has developed high yield varieties and hybrids of [[cotton]], [[sunflower]], safflower, and sweet sorghum (named Madhura),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebetterindia.com/92959/sweet-sorghum-syrup-health-food/|title=Syrup made from sweet sorghum could be next best health food|work=From the Better India}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as technology for producing ethanol, jaggery and syrup from sweet sorghum. NARI also carries out agrochemical testing for various companies and research laboratories in India to the standards of the Central Insecticides Board for the purposes of registration of new agro-chemicals.

==Renewable energy==
Work in this field has been mostly in solar and biomass energy and recently in sustainable and environmentally friendly transport systems, ethanol lighting/cooking and handicapped rickshaw.
*NARI has developed an efficient multifuel lantern called Noorie for rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010722/nation.htm|title=Lantern research at NARI|work=From The Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Complete technology for producing ethanol from sweet [[sorghum]] has been developed at the institute. A number of high ethanol yielding varieties have also been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hedon.info/NariEthanolStove|title=Ethanol Stove research at NARI}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*NARI has developed a stove running on 50% (w/w) and more ethanol/water concentration.[http://southasia.oneworld.net/todaysheadlines/indian-ngo-awarded-for-its-innovative-lantern-cum-stove]
*The [[gasification]] technology for thermal applications has been developed at NARI, including technology for gasification of loose leafy biomass fuels like sugarcane leaves and bagasse, sweet sorghum stalks and bagasse.[http://gasifiers.bioenergylists.org/naribagassegas]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2980">In [[geometry and topology]], it is a usual axiom of a [[manifold]] to be a [[Hausdorff space]]. In [[general topology]], this axiom is relaxed, and one studies '''non-Hausdorff manifolds''': spaces [[locally homeomorphic]] to [[Euclidean space]], but not necessarily Hausdorff.

==Examples==

===Line with two origins===
The most familiar non-Hausdorff manifold is the '''line with two origins''', or '''bug-eyed line'''.

This is the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of two copies of the real line
:'''R''' × {''a''} and '''R''' × {''b''}
with the [[equivalence relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;(x,a) \sim (x,b)\text{ if }x \neq 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This space has a single point for each nonzero real number ''r'' and two points 0&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; and 0&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;.  A local base of open neighborhoods of &lt;math&gt;0_a&lt;/math&gt; in this space can be thought to consist of sets of the form &lt;math&gt;\{r\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}\vert-\varepsilon&lt;r&lt;\varepsilon\}\cup\{0_a\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is any positive real number.  A similar description of a local base of open neighborhoods of &lt;math&gt;0_b&lt;/math&gt; is possible. Thus, in this space all neighbourhoods of 0&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; intersect all neighbourhoods of 0&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;, so it is non-Hausdorff.

Further, the line with two origins does not have the homotopy type of a [[CW-complex]], or of any Hausdorff space.&lt;ref&gt;Gabard, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Branching line===
Similar to the line with two origins is the '''branching line'''.

This is the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of two copies of the real line
:'''R''' × {''a''} and '''R''' × {''b''}
with the [[equivalence relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;(x,a) \sim (x,b)\text{ if }x &lt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This space has a single point for each negative real number ''r'' and two points &lt;math&gt;x_a, x_b&lt;/math&gt; for every non-negative number: it has a "fork" at zero.

===Etale space===
The [[etale space]] of a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]], such as the sheaf of continuous real functions over a manifold, is a manifold that is often non-Hausdorff. (The etale space is Hausdorff if it is a sheaf of functions with some sort of [[analytic continuation]] property.){{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Quantum path integration (sum over histories)===
Mark F. Sharlow claims that functional spacetime of [[Path integration|path integral]] has a "branching" non-Hausdorff structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mark F. Sharlow|title=The quantum mechanical path integral: toward a realistic interpretation|url=https://www.eskimo.com/~msharlow/path.pdf|date=2005–2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The largest possible [[proton affinity]] value for a base in a solution of water is that of hydroxide, 1,633.14 kJ/mol.  Bases with higher proton affinities irreversibly abstract protons from water, and as a result the anions cannot be observed.  Therefore, stronger bases must be used in an [[aprotic solvent]] such as [[tetrahydrofuran]] (oxolane). According to calculations, ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion is the strongest possible organic base, with a proton affinity of 1843 kJ [[Mole (unit)|mol]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion has two isomers: [[Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion|''Meta-''diethynylbenzene dianion]] and [[Para-diethynylbenzene dianion|''Para-''diethynylbenzene dianion]].  Because these ions would abstract protons from any organic solvent, they are known only in the gas phase.&lt;ref name="article" /&gt;

== Synthesis and Observation ==

Since ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion cannot be made in solution, investigation of the dianion is difficult. In the gas phase, however, the absence of any solvent interaction provides an ideal environment for investigating the basicity of the compound, and the gas phase value of the proton affinity can be calculated with greater precision.

The synthesis of ortho-diethynlbenzene dianion was performed in a linear quadrupole ion-trap mass spectometer. [[Electrospray ionization|Electrospray Ionisation]] (ESI) of the diacid precursor results in the dicarboxylate dianion ([C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]) losing two Hydrogen ions to become ([C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;). The dianion was mass-selected and then subjected to [[Collision-induced dissociation|Collision Induced Dissociation]] (CID), resulting in the loss of two dioxide molecules and generation of the ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion:
[[File:O-diethynylbenzene dianion preparation.png|thumb|center|upright=3.0|Preparation of o-diethynylbezene dianion from the dicarboxylate precursor]]

The meta and para isomers were prepared analogously. 

Reactions of the gas-phase dianions were studied by reacting with a small quantity of the desired reagent added to the helium carrier gas. Reaction with [[heavy water]] produced a singly-deuterated monanion with ''[[Mass-to-charge ratio|m/z]]'' 126. Reaction with benzene produced the phenide anion, ''m/z'' 77, highlighting the extreme basicity of the dianion. Attempted reaction with [[deuterium]] gas and deuterated [[methane]] was not successful despite the favourable thermodynamics; the authors attribute this to the high [[activation energy|activation barrier]] for proton abstraction from those substrates.&lt;ref name="article" /&gt;

'''Porous silicon''' (abbreviated as "PS" or "pSi") is a form of the chemical element [[silicon]] that has introduced [[nanoporous|nanopores]] in its [[microstructure]], rendering a large surface to volume ratio in the order of 500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==History==

Porous silicon was discovered by accident in 1956 by Arthur Uhlir Jr. and Ingeborg Uhlir at the [[Bell Labs]] in the U.S. At the time, the Ulhirs were in the process of developing a technique for polishing and shaping the surfaces of silicon and [[germanium]]. However, it was found that under several conditions a crude product in the form of thick black, red or brown film were formed on the surface of the material. At the time, the findings were not taken further and were only mentioned in Bell Lab's technical notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Canham |first=Leigh T. |authorlink=Leigh Canham |date=10 April 1993 |title=A glowing future for silicon: Chips and circuits could work much faster if they used light to communicate with each other. Fragile layers of porous silicon could be just the thing to let them do it |work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13818683.800-a-glowing-future-for-silicon-chips-and-circuits-could-work-much-faster-if-they-used-light-to-communicate-with-each-other-fragile-layers-of-porous-silicon-could-be-just-the-thing-to-let-them-do-it.html |accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the discovery of porous silicon in the 1950s, the scientific community was not interested in porous silicon until the late 1980s. At the time, [[Leigh Canham]] – while working at the [[Defence Research Agency]] in England – reasoned that the porous silicon may display quantum confinement effects.&lt;ref&gt;Sailor Research Group 17 February 2003, [http://chem-faculty.ucsd.edu/sailor/research/porous_Si_intro.html Introduction to Porous Si], Sailor research group at UCSD, Department of Chemistry, University of California.&lt;/ref&gt; The intuition was followed by successful experimental results published in 1990. In the published experiment, it was revealed that silicon wafers can emit light if subjected to [[electrochemical]] and [[chemical]] dissolution.

The published result stimulated the interest of the scientific community in its [[nonlinear optics|non-linear optical]] and [[electrical]] properties. The growing interest was evidenced in the number of published work concerning the properties and potential applications of porous silicon. In an article published in 2000, it was found that the number of published work grew exponentially in between 1991 and 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parkhutik |first1=Vera |journal=Journal of Porous Materials |volume=7 |pages=363 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1009643206266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a team of scientists at the [[Technical University of Munich]] inadvertently discovered that [[Hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] porous silicon reacts explosively with [[oxygen]] at [[cryogenic]] temperatures, releasing several times as much energy as an equivalent amount of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], at a much greater speed. (An abstract of the study can be found below.) Explosion occurs because the oxygen, which is in a liquid state at the necessary temperatures, is able to [[Oxidation|oxidize]] through the porous molecular structure of the silicon extremely rapidly, causing a very quick and efficient [[detonation]]. Although hydrogenated porous silicon would probably not be effective as a weapon, due to its functioning only at low temperatures, other uses are being explored for its explosive properties, such as providing thrust for [[satellite]]s.

==Fabrication of porous silicon==

Fabrication of porous silicon may range from initial formation through [[Etching (microfabrication)|stain-etching]] or by forming an [[anodizing|anodization]] cell.  Drying, storage of porous silicon, and surface modification are needed afterwards.  If anodization in an aqueous solution is used to form microporous silicon, the material is commonly treated in ethanol immediately after fabrication, to avoid damage to the structure that results due to the stresses of the capillary effect of the aqueous solution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/khalidtantawi/porous-silicon  Porous Silicon Fabrication, retrieved April 3, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anodization===
[[File:Anodization cell.svg|alt=Anodization cell|thumb|Schematic view of the anodization cell]]
One method of introducing pores in silicon is through the use of an anodization cell. A possible anodization cell employs platinum cathode and silicon wafer anode immersed in [[hydrogen fluoride]] (HF) electrolyte. Recently, inert diamond cathodes are used to avoid metallic impurities in the electrolyte and inert diamond anodes form an improved electrical back plate contact to the silicon wafers. [[Corrosion]] of the [[anode]] is produced by running electric current through the cell. It is noted that the running of constant [[Direct current|DC]] is usually implemented to ensure steady tip-concentration of HF resulting in a more [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] porosity layer although pulsed current is more appropriate for the formation of thick silicon wafers bigger than 50&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref name="hal"&gt;Halimaoui A. 1997, "Porous silicon formation by anodization", in ''Properties of Porous Silicon''. Canham, L. T., Institution of Engineering and Technology, London, {{ISBN|0-85296-932-5}} pp. 12–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was noted by Halimaoui that [[hydrogen]] evolution occurs during the formation of porous silicon. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;When purely aqueous HF solutions are used for the PS formation, the hydrogen bubbles stick to the surface and induce lateral and in-depth inhomogeneity&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The hydrogen evolution is normally treated with absolute [[ethanol]] in concentration exceeding 15%. It was found that the introduction of ethanol eliminates hydrogen and ensures complete infiltration of HF solution within the pores. Subsequently, uniform distribution of porosity and thickness is improved.

===Stain etching===

It is possible to obtain porous silicon through stain-etching with [[hydrofluoric acid]], [[nitric acid]] and [[water]]. A publication in 1957 revealed that stain films can be grown in dilute solutions of nitric acid in concentrated hydrofluoric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Archer|first1=R. |title=Stain films on silicon|journal=Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids|volume=14|pages=104|year=1960|doi=10.1016/0022-3697(60)90215-8|bibcode = 1960JPCS...14..104A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Porous silicon formation by stain-etching is particularly attractive because of its simplicity and the presence of readily available corrosive reagents; namely nitric acid (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and hydrogen fluoride (HF). Furthermore, stain-etching is useful if one needs to produce a very thin porous Si films.&lt;ref&gt;Coffer J. L. 1997, "Porous silicon formation by stain etching", in ''Properties of Porous Silicon'', Canham, L. T., Institution of Engineering and Technology, London, {{ISBN|0-85296-932-5}} pp. 23–28.&lt;/ref&gt; A publication in 1960 by R. J. Archer revealed that it is possible to create stain films as thin as 25&amp;nbsp;Å through stain-etching with HF-HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solution.

=== Bottom-Up Synthesis ===

Porous silicon can be synthesized chemically from silicon tetrachloride, using self-forming salt byproducts as templates for pore formation. The salt templates are later removed with water.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140410/ncomms4605/full/ncomms4605.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drying of porous silicon==

Porous silicon is systematically prone to presence of cracks when the water is evaporated. The cracks are particularly evident in thick or highly porous silicon layers.&lt;ref&gt;Bellet D. 1997, "Drying of porous silicon", in ''Properties of Porous Silicon'', Canham, L. T., Institution of Engineering and Technology, London, {{ISBN|0-85296-932-5}} pp. 38–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the cracks has been attributed to the large [[capillary]] stress due to the minute size of the pores. In particular, it has been known that cracks will appear for porous silicon samples with thickness larger than a certain critical value. Bellet concluded that it was impossible to avoid cracking in thick porous silicon layers under normal evaporating conditions. Hence, several appropriate techniques have been developed to minimize the risk of cracks formed during drying.

;Supercritical drying
[[Supercritical drying]] is reputed to be the most efficient drying technique but is rather expensive and difficult to implement. It was first implemented by Canham in 1994 and involves [[superheating]] the liquid pore above the critical point to avoid interfacial tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Canham|first1=L. T.|last2=Cullis|first2=A. G.|last3=Pickering|first3=C.|last4=Dosser|first4=O. D.|last5=Cox|first5=T. I.|last6=Lynch|first6=T. P.|title=Luminescent anodized silicon aerocrystal networks prepared by supercritical drying|journal=Nature|volume=368|pages=133|year=1994|doi=10.1038/368133a0|issue=6467|bibcode = 1994Natur.368..133C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Freeze drying
[[Freeze drying]] procedure was first documented around 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amato|first1=G.|title=Porous silicon via freeze drying|journal=Materials Letters|volume=26|pages=295|year=1996|doi=10.1016/0167-577X(95)00244-8|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the formation of porous silicon, the sample is frozen at a temperature of about 200 K and sublimed under vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=S. M.|last2=James|first2=D.|last3=Ali|first3=Z.|last4=Bouchaour|first4=M.|title=Effect of drying on porous silicon|journal=Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry|volume=76|pages=677|year=2004|doi=10.1023/B:JTAN.0000028047.00086.ef|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Pentane drying
The technique uses [[pentane]] as the drying liquid instead of water. In doing so the capillary stress is reduced because pentane has a lower surface tension than water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Fuguo|last2=Song|first2=Shiyong|last3=Zhang|first3=Junyan|title=Surface texturing of porous silicon with capillary stress and its superhydrophobicity|journal=Chemical Communications|pages=4239|year=2009|doi=10.1039/b905769b|issue=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Slow evaporation
[[evaporation|Slow evaporating]] technique can be implemented following the water or ethanol rinsing. It was found that slow evaporation decreased the trap density

==Surface modification of porous silicon==

The surface of porous silicon may be modified to exhibit different properties. Often, freshly etched porous silicon may be unstable due to the rate of its [[oxidation]] by the atmosphere or unsuitable for cell attachment purposes. Therefore, it can be surface modified to improve stability and cell attachment

===Surface modification improving stability===

Following the formation of porous silicon, its surface is covered with [[covalent bond|covalently]] bonded hydrogen. Although the hydrogen coated surface is sufficiently stable when exposed to inert atmosphere for a short period of time, prolonged exposure render the surface prone to oxidation by atmospheric oxygen. The oxidation promotes instability in the surface and is undesirable for many applications. Thus, several methods were developed to promote the surface stability of porous silicon.

An approach that can be taken is through [[thermal oxidation]]. The process involves heating the silicon to a temperature above 1000 C to promote full oxidation of silicon. The method reportedly produced samples with good stability to aging and electronic surface [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]].&lt;ref&gt;Chazalviel J. N., Ozanam F. 1997, "Surface modification of porous silicon", in ''Properties of Porous Silicon, Canham'', L. T., Institution of Engineering and Technology, London, {{ISBN|0-85296-932-5}} pp. 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Porous silicon exhibits a high degree of [[biocompatibility]]. The large surface area enables [[organic chemistry|organic]] molecules to adhere well. It degrades to [[silicic acid|Orthosillicic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Williams57/publication/235997830_Porous_Silicon_Membrane_for_Investigation_of_Transmembrane_Proteins/links/00b7d520a40a2b336b000000.pdf  Tantawi et. al. Porous silicon membrane for investigation of transmembrane proteins, Journal of Superlattices and Microstructures, Vol. 58, 2013, pages 78-80]&lt;/ref&gt; which causes no harm to the body. This has opened potential applications in medicine such as a framework of the growth of [[bone]].

===Surface modification improving cell adhesion===

Surface modification can also affect properties that promote [[cell adhesion]]. One particular research in 2005 studied the mammalian cell adhesion on the modified surfaces of porous silicon. The research used rat [[PC12 cells]] and [[Lens (anatomy)|Human Lens Epithelial (HLE)]] cells cultured for four hours on the surface modified porous silicon. Cells were then stained with vital dye FDA and observed under [[fluorescence microscopy]]. The research concluded that "amino [[silanisation]] and coating the pSi surface with collagen enhanced cell attachment and spreading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Low |first1=S. P. |last2=Williams |first2=K. A. |last3=Canham |first3=L. T. |last4=Voelcker |first4=N. H. |title=Evaluation of mammalian cell adhesion on surface-modified porous silicon |journal=Biomaterials |volume=27 |issue=26 |pages=4538–46 |year=2006 |pmid=16707158 |doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification of porous silicon==

===Porosity===
Porosity is defined as the fraction of void within the pSi layer and can be determined easily by weight measurement.&lt;ref name=hal/&gt; During formation of porous silicon layer through anodization, the porosity of a wafer can be increased through increasing current density, decreasing HF concentration and thicker silicon layer. The porosity of porous silicon may range from 4% for macroporous layers to 95% for mesoporous layers. A study by Canham in 1995 found that "a 1&amp;nbsp;µm thick layer of high porosity silicon completely dissolved within a day of in-vitro exposure to a [[simulated body fluid]]".&lt;ref name=Canham&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Canham|first1=Leigh T.|title=Bioactive silicon structure fabrication through nanoetching techniques|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=7|pages=1033|year=1995|doi=10.1002/adma.19950071215|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also found that a silicon wafer with medium to low porosity displayed more stability. Hence, the porosity of porous silicon is varied depending on its potential application areas.

===Pore size===
The porosity value of silicon is a macroscopic parameter and doesn’t yield any information regarding the microstructure of the layer. It is proposed that the properties of a sample are more accurately predicted if the pore size and its distribution within the sample can be obtained. Therefore, porous silicon has been divided into three categories based on the size of its pores; [[macropore|macroporous]], [[mesoporous]], and [[Microporous material|microporous]].

==Key characteristic of porous silicon==

===Highly controllable properties===

Porous silicon studies conducted in 1995 showed that the behavior of porous silicon can be altered in between "bio-inert", "bioactive" and "resorbable" by varying the porosity of the silicon sample.&lt;ref name=Canham/&gt; The in-vitro study used simulated body fluid containing ion concentration similar to the human blood and tested the activities of porous silicon sample when exposed to the fluids for prolonged period of time. It was found that high porosity mesoporous layers were completely removed by the simulated body fluids within a day. In contrast, low to medium porosity microporous layers displayed more stable configurations and induced hydroxyapatite growth.

===Bioactive===

The first sign of porous silicon as a [[Biological activity|bioactive]] material was found in 1995. In the conducted study, it was found that [[hydroxyapatite]] growth was occurring on porous silicon areas. It was then suggested that "hydrated microporous Si could be a bioactive form of the [[semiconductor]] and suggest that Si itself should be seriously considered for development as a material for widespread [[in vivo]] applications."&lt;ref name=Canham/&gt; Another paper published the finding that porous silicon may be used a substrate for hydroxyapatite growth either by simple soaking process or laser-liquid-solid interaction process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pramatarova|first1=L.|last2=Pecheva|first2=E.|last3=Dimovamalinovska|first3=D.|last4=Pramatarova|first4=R.|last5=Bismayer|first5=U.|last6=Petrov|first6=T.|last7=Minkovski|first7=N.|title=Porous silicon as a substrate for hydroxyapatite growth|journal=Vacuum|volume=76|pages=135|year=2004|doi=10.1016/j.vacuum.2004.07.004|issue=2–3|bibcode=2004Vacuu..76..135P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, [[in-vitro]] studies have been conducted to evaluate the interaction of cells with porous silicon. A 1995 study of the interaction of [[Hippocampus|B50 rat hippocampal cells]] with porous silicon found that B50 cells have clear preference for adhesion to porous silicon over untreated surface. The study indicated that porous silicon can be suitable for [[cell culture|cell culturing]] purposes and can be used to control cell growth pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sapelkin|first1=A.|last2=Bayliss|first2=S.|last3=Unal|first3=B.|last4=Charalambou|first4=A.|title=Interaction of B50 rat hippocampal cells with stain-etched porous silicon|journal=Biomaterials|volume=27|issue=6|pages=842–6|year=2006|pmid=16098578|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.06.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-toxic waste product===

Another positive attribute of porous silicon is the degradation of porous silicon into [[monomer]]ic silicic acid (SiOH4). Silicic acid is reputed to be the most natural form of element in the environment and is readily removed by [[kidney]]s.

The human [[blood plasma]] contains monomeric silicic acid at levels of less than 1&amp;nbsp;mg Si/l, corresponding to the average dietary intake of 20–50&amp;nbsp;mg/day. It was proposed that the small thickness of silicon coatings presents minimal risk to a toxic concentration being reached. The proposal was supported by an experiment involving volunteers and silicic-acid drinks. It was found that concentration of the acid rose only briefly above the normal 1&amp;nbsp;mg Si/l level and was efficiently expelled by urine excretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Canham, L. T., Aston R. |title=Will a chip every day keep the doctor away? |journal=Physics World |volume=14 |issue=7 |pages=27–32 |date=July 2001 |format= |url=http://physicsworldarchive.iop.org/full/pwa-pdf/14/7/phwv14i7a31.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superhydrophobicity===

The simple adjustment of pore morphology and geometry of porous silicon also offers a convenient way to control its wetting behavior. Stable ultra- and [[superhydrophobic]] states on porous silicon can be fabricated and used in [[lab-on-a-chip]], [[microfluidic]] devices for the improved surface-based bioanalysis.&lt;ref name=Ressine2007&gt;{{cite journal|author = Ressine, A.|author2=Marko-Varga, G. |author3=Laurell, T. |year = 2007|title = Porous silicon protein microarray technology and ultra-/superhydrophobic states for improved bioanalytical readout|journal = Biotechnology Annual Review|volume = 13|pages = 149–200|pmid = 17875477|doi = 10.1016/S1387-2656(07)13007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optical properties===
pSi demonstrates [[Optics|optical properties]] based on porosity and the medium inside the pores. The effective [[refractive index]] of pSi is determined by the porosity and refractive index of the medium inside the pores. If the refractive index of the medium inside pores is high, the effective refractive index of pSi will be high as well. This phenomenon causes the [[spectrum]] to shift towards longer [[wavelength]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ouyang|first1=Huimin|title=Biosensing using porous silicon photonic bandgap structures|volume=6005|pages=600508|year=2005|doi=10.1117/12.629961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12892">In [[power engineering]], the '''power-flow study''',  or  '''load-flow study''', is a [[numerical analysis]] of the flow of electric power in an interconnected system. A power-flow study usually uses simplified notations such as a [[one-line diagram]] and [[per-unit system]], and focuses on various aspects of [[AC power]] parameters, such as voltages, voltage angles, real power and reactive power. It analyzes the power systems in normal steady-state operation.

Power-flow or load-flow studies are important for planning future expansion of power systems as well as in determining the best operation of existing systems. The principal information obtained from the power-flow study is the magnitude and phase angle of the voltage at each [[busbar|bus]], and the real and reactive power flowing in each line.

Commercial power systems are usually too complex to allow for hand solution of the power flow.  Special purpose [[Network analyzer (AC power)|network analyzers]] were built between 1929 and the early 1960s to provide laboratory-scale physical models of power systems. Large-scale digital computers replaced the analog methods with numerical solutions.

In addition to a power-flow study, computer programs perform related calculations such as [[short-circuit]] fault analysis, stability studies (transient and steady-state), unit commitment and [[economic dispatch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Low | first1 = S. H. | chapter = Convex relaxation of optimal power flow: A tutorial | doi = 10.1109/IREP.2013.6629391 | title = 2013 IREP Symposium Bulk Power System Dynamics and Control - IX Optimization, Security and Control of the Emerging Power Grid | pages = 1–06 | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-1-4799-0199-9 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, some programs use [[linear programming]] to find the ''optimal power flow'', the conditions which give the lowest cost per [[kilowatt hour]] delivered.

A load flow study is especially valuable for a system with multiple load centers, such as a refinery complex. The power flow study is an analysis of the system’s capability to adequately supply the connected load. The total system losses, as well as individual line losses, also are tabulated. Transformer tap positions are selected to ensure the correct voltage at critical locations such as motor control centers. Performing a load flow study on an existing system provides insight and recommendations as to the system operation and optimization of control settings to obtain maximum capacity while minimizing the operating costs. The results of such an analysis are in terms of active power, reactive power, magnitude and phase angle. Furthermore, power-flow computations are crucial for [[Unit_commitment_problem_in_electrical_power_production|optimal operations of groups of generating units]].

The [[Open Energy Modelling Initiative]] promotes [[open source]] load-flow models and other types of energy system models.

==Model==
An '''alternating current power-flow model''' is a model used in electrical engineering to analyze [[power grids]]. It provides a [[Nonlinear#Nonlinear systems|nonlinear system]] which describes the energy flow through each transmission line. The problem is non-linear because the power flow into load impedances is a function of the square of the applied voltages. Due to nonlinearity, in many cases the analysis of large network via AC power-flow model is not feasible, and a linear (but less accurate) DC power-flow model is used instead.

Usually analysis of a three-phase system is simplified by assuming balanced loading of all three phases. Steady-state operation is assumed, with no transient changes in power flow or voltage due to load or generation changes. The system frequency is also assumed to be constant. A further simplification is to use the [[per-unit system]] to represent all voltages, power flows, and impedances, scaling the actual target system values to some convenient base. A system [[one-line diagram]] is the basis to build a mathematical model of the generators, loads, buses, and transmission lines of the system, and their electrical impedances and ratings.

==Power-flow problem formulation==
The goal of a power-flow study is to obtain complete voltages angle and magnitude information for each bus in a power system for specified load and generator real power and voltage conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=J. |last1=Grainger |first2= W.|last2= Stevenson|title=Power System Analysis|publisher= McGraw–Hill|location= New York|year=1994| isbn= 0-07-061293-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once this information is known, real and reactive power flow on each branch as well as generator reactive power output can be analytically determined. Due to the nonlinear nature of this problem, numerical methods are employed to obtain a solution that is within an acceptable tolerance.

The solution to the power-flow problem begins with identifying the known and unknown variables in the system. The known and unknown variables are dependent on the type of bus. A bus without any generators connected to it is called a Load Bus. With one exception, a bus with at least one generator connected to it is called a Generator Bus. The exception is one arbitrarily-selected bus that has a generator. This bus is referred to as the [[slack bus]].

In the power-flow problem, it is assumed that the real power ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; and reactive power ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; at each Load Bus are known. For this reason, Load Buses are also known as PQ Buses. For Generator Buses, it is assumed that the real power generated ''P&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the voltage magnitude |''V''| is known. For the Slack Bus, it is assumed that the voltage magnitude |''V''| and voltage phase ''Θ'' are known. Therefore, for each Load Bus, both the voltage magnitude and angle are unknown and must be solved for; for each Generator Bus, the voltage angle must be solved for; there are no variables that must be solved for the Slack Bus. In a system with ''N'' buses and ''R'' generators, there are then &lt;math&gt;2(N-1) - (R-1)&lt;/math&gt; unknowns.

In order to solve for the &lt;math&gt;2(N-1) - (R-1)&lt;/math&gt; unknowns, there must be &lt;math&gt;2(N-1) - (R-1)&lt;/math&gt; equations that do not introduce any new unknown variables. The possible equations to use are power balance equations, which can be written for real and reactive power for each bus.
The real power balance equation is:

: &lt;math&gt;0 = -P_{i} + \sum_{k=1}^N |V_i||V_k|(G_{ik}\cos\theta_{ik}+B_{ik}\sin\theta_{ik})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the net active power injected at bus ''i'', &lt;math&gt;G_{ik}&lt;/math&gt; is the real part of the element in the [[Ybus matrix|bus admittance matrix]] Y&lt;sub&gt;BUS&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to the &lt;math&gt;i_{th}&lt;/math&gt; row and &lt;math&gt;k_{th}&lt;/math&gt; column, &lt;math&gt;B_{ik}&lt;/math&gt; is the imaginary part of the element in the Y&lt;sub&gt;BUS&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to the &lt;math&gt;i_{th}&lt;/math&gt;  row and &lt;math&gt;k_{th}&lt;/math&gt;  column and &lt;math&gt;\theta_{ik}&lt;/math&gt; is the difference in voltage angle between the &lt;math&gt;i_{th}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;k_{th}&lt;/math&gt;  buses (&lt;math&gt;\theta_{ik}=\delta_i-\delta_k&lt;/math&gt;). The reactive power balance equation is:

: &lt;math&gt;0 = -Q_{i} + \sum_{k=1}^N |V_i||V_k|(G_{ik}\sin\theta_{ik}-B_{ik}\cos\theta_{ik})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; is the net reactive power injected at bus ''i''.

Equations included are the real and reactive power balance equations for each Load Bus and the real power balance equation for each Generator Bus. Only the real power balance equation is written for a Generator Bus because the net reactive power injected is assumed to be unknown and therefore including the reactive power balance equation would result in an additional unknown variable. For similar reasons, there are no equations written for the Slack Bus.

In many transmission systems, the voltage angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_{ik}&lt;/math&gt; are usually relatively small. There is thus a strong coupling between real power and voltage angle, and between reactive power and voltage magnitude, while the coupling between real power and voltage magnitude, as well as reactive power and voltage angle, is weak. As a result, real power is usually transmitted from the bus with higher voltage angle to the bus with lower voltage angle, and reactive power is usually transmitted from the bus with higher voltage magnitude to the bus with lower voltage magnitude. However, this approximation does not hold when the voltage angle is very large.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeh.ee.ethz.ch/uploads/tx_ethstudies/modelling_hs08_script_02.pdf Andersson, G: Lectures on Modelling and Analysis of Electric Power Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215042633/http://www.eeh.ee.ethz.ch/uploads/tx_ethstudies/modelling_hs08_script_02.pdf |date=2017-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newton–Raphson solution method==
There are several different methods of solving the resulting nonlinear system of equations. The most popular is known as the Newton–Raphson method. This method begins with initial guesses of all unknown variables (voltage magnitude and angles at Load Buses and voltage angles at Generator Buses). Next, a [[Taylor Series]] is written, with the higher order terms ignored, for each of the power balance equations included in the system of equations .
The result is a linear system of equations that can be expressed as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\Delta \theta \\ \Delta |V|\end{bmatrix} = -J^{-1} \begin{bmatrix}\Delta P \\ \Delta Q \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q&lt;/math&gt; are called the mismatch equations:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta P_i = -P_i + \sum_{k=1}^N |V_i||V_k|(G_{ik}\cos\theta_{ik}+B_{ik}\sin \theta_{ik})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta Q_{i} =  -Q_{i} + \sum_{k=1}^N |V_i||V_k|(G_{ik}\sin\theta_{ik}-B_{ik}\cos\theta_{ik})&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix of partial derivatives known as a [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]]:
&lt;math&gt;J=\begin{bmatrix} \dfrac{\partial \Delta P}{\partial\theta} &amp; \dfrac{\partial \Delta P}{\partial |V|} \\ \dfrac{\partial \Delta Q}{\partial \theta}&amp; \dfrac{\partial \Delta Q}{\partial |V|}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

The linearized system of equations is solved to determine the next guess (''m'' + 1) of voltage magnitude and angles based on:

: &lt;math&gt;\theta^{m+1} = \theta^m + \Delta \theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;|V|^{m+1} = |V|^m + \Delta |V|\,&lt;/math&gt;

The process continues until a stopping condition is met. A common stopping condition is to terminate if the [[Matrix norm|norm]] of the mismatch equations is below a specified tolerance.

A rough outline of solution of the power-flow problem is:
# Make an initial guess of all unknown voltage magnitudes and angles. It is common to use a "flat start" in which all voltage angles are set to zero and all voltage magnitudes are set to 1.0 p.u.
# Solve the power balance equations using the most recent voltage angle and magnitude values.
# Linearize the system around the most recent voltage angle and magnitude values
# Solve for the change in voltage angle and magnitude
# Update the voltage magnitude and angles
# Check the stopping conditions, if met then terminate, else go to step 2.

==Other power-flow methods==
*[[Gauss–Seidel method]]: This is the earliest devised method. It shows slower rates of convergence compared to other iterative methods, but it uses very little memory and does not need to solve a matrix system.
*[[Fast-decoupled-load-flow method]] is a variation on Newton-Raphson that exploits the approximate decoupling of active and reactive flows in well-behaved power networks, and additionally fixes the value of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] during the iteration in order to avoid costly matrix decompositions. Also referred to as "fixed-slope, decoupled NR". Within the algorithm, the Jacobian matrix gets inverted only once, and there are three assumptions. Firstly, the conductance between the buses is zero. Secondly, the magnitude of the bus voltage is one per unit. Thirdly, the sine of phases between buses is zero.  Fast decoupled load flow can return the answer within seconds whereas the Newton Raphson method takes much longer. This is useful for real-time management of power grids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stott|first=B.|last2=Alsac|first2=O.|date=May 1974|title=Fast Decoupled Load Flow|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4075431/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems|language=en-US|volume=PAS-93|issue=3|pages=859–869|doi=10.1109/tpas.1974.293985|issn=0018-9510}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Holomorphic embedding load flow method]]: A recently developed method based on advanced techniques of complex analysis. It is direct and guarantees the calculation of the correct (operative) branch, out of the multiple solutions present in the power flow equations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7213">A '''pulsed plasma thruster (PPT)''', also known as a plasma jet engine, is a form of [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric spacecraft propulsion]].&lt;ref name = NASAPPT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs23grc.html|title=NASA Glenn Research Center PPT|work=National Aeronautics &amp; Space Administration (NASA)|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PPTs are generally considered the simplest form of electric spacecraft propulsion and were the first form of electric propulsion to be flown in space, having flown on two Soviet probes ([[Zond 2]] and [[Zond 3]]) starting in 1964.&lt;ref name = SURREY_UNI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/26851//|title=University of Surrey PPT Thesis Abstract|work=Doctoral Thesis - University of Surrey|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPTs are generally flown on [[spacecraft]] with a surplus of electricity from abundantly available solar energy.

== Operation ==
[[File:SchematiclayoutofaPulsedPlasmaThruster.png|thumb|Schematic layout of a Pulsed Plasma Thruster]]
Most PPTs use a solid material (normally [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]], more commonly known as Teflon) for [[propellant]], although very few use liquid or gaseous propellants. The first stage in PPT operation involves an [[electric arc|arc of electricity]] passing through the fuel, causing [[ablation]] and [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] of the fuel. The heat generated by this arc causes the resultant gas to turn into [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], thereby creating a charged gas cloud. Due to the force of the ablation, the plasma is propelled at low speed between two charged plates (an [[anode]] and [[cathode]]). Since the plasma is charged, the fuel effectively completes the circuit between the two plates, allowing a current to flow through the plasma. This flow of electrons generates a strong electromagnetic field which then exerts a [[Lorentz force]] on the plasma, accelerating the plasma out of the PPT exhaust at high velocity.&lt;ref name = NASAPPT/&gt; Its mode of operation is similar to a [[railgun]]. The pulsing occurs due to the time needed to recharge the plates following each burst of fuel, and the time between each arc. The frequency of pulsing is normally very high and so it generates an almost continuous and smooth thrust. While the thrust is very low, a PPT can operate continuously for extended periods of time, yielding a large final speed.

The energy used in each pulse is stored in a capacitor.&lt;ref name = THE_ENGINEER&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/aerospace/news/plasma-thrusters-could-double-the-lifetime-of-mini-satellites/1011817.article|title=Plasma thrusters could double the lifetime of mini satellites|work=[[The Engineer (magazine)|The Engineer]]|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By varying the time between each capacitor discharge, the thrust and power draw of the PPT can be varied allowing versatile use of the system.&lt;ref name = SURREY_UNI/&gt;

== Comparison to chemical propulsion ==
The equation for the change in velocity of a spacecraft is given by the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation|rocket equation]] as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta v = v_\text{e} \ln \frac{m_0}{m_1}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta v\ &lt;/math&gt; is delta-v - the maximum change of speed of the vehicle (with no external forces acting),
:&lt;math&gt;v_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[effective exhaust velocity]] (&lt;math&gt;v_\text{e} = I_\text{sp} \cdot g_0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;I_\text{sp}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific impulse]] expressed as a time period and &lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt; is [[standard gravity]]),
:&lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; refers to the [[natural logarithm]] function,
:&lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial total mass, including propellant,
:&lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; is the final total mass.

PPTs have much higher exhaust velocities than chemical propulsion engines, but have a much smaller fuel flow rate. From the Tsiolkovsky equation stated above, this results in a proportionally higher final velocity of the propelled craft. The exhaust velocity of a PPT is of the order of tens of km/s while conventional chemical propulsion generates [[thermal velocity|thermal velocities]] in the range of 2–4.5&amp;nbsp;km/s. Due to this lower thermal velocity, chemical propulsion units become exponentially less effective at higher vehicle velocities, necessitating the use of electric spacecraft propulsion such as PPTs. It is therefore advantageous to use an electric propulsion system such as a PPT to generate high interplanetary speeds in the range 20–70&amp;nbsp;km/s.

[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA's]] research PPT (flown in 2000) achieved an exhaust velocity of 13,700&amp;nbsp;m/s, generated a [[thrust]] of 860&amp;nbsp;µN, and consumed 70{{nbsp}}W of electrical power.&lt;ref name = NASAPPT/&gt;

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

PPTs are very robust due to their inherently simple design (relative to other electric spacecraft propulsion techniques). As an electric propulsion system, PPTs benefit from reduced fuel consumption compared to traditional chemical rockets, reducing launch mass and therefore launch costs, as well as high specific impulse improving performance.&lt;ref name = NASAPPT/&gt;

However, due to energy losses caused by late time ablation and rapid [[conductive heat transfer]] from the propellant to the rest of the spacecraft, propulsive efficiency (kinetic energy of exhaust / total energy used) is very low compared to other forms of electric propulsion, at around just 10%.

== Uses ==

PPTs are well-suited to uses on relatively small spacecraft with a mass of less than 100&amp;nbsp;kg (particularly [[Cubesat|CubeSats]]) for roles such as [[attitude control]], [[Orbital station-keeping|station keeping]], de-orbiting manoeuvres and deep space exploration. Using PPTs could double the life-span of these small satellite missions without significantly increasing complexity or cost due to the inherent simplicity and relatively low cost nature of PPTs.&lt;ref name = THE_ENGINEER/&gt;

The first use of PPTs was on the [[Soviet]] [[Zond 2]] [[space probe]] on 30 November 1964.

A PPT was flown by NASA in November, 2000, as a flight experiment on the [[Earth Observing-1]] spacecraft. The thrusters successfully demonstrated the ability to perform roll control on the spacecraft and also demonstrated that the [[electromagnetic interference]] from the pulsed plasma did not affect other spacecraft systems.&lt;ref name = NASAPPT/&gt; Pulsed Plasma Thrusters are also an avenue of research used by universities for starting experiments with electric propulsion due to the relative simplicity and lower costs involved with PPTs as opposed to other forms of electric propulsion such as [[Hall-effect thruster|Hall-effect ion thrusters]].&lt;ref name = SURREY_UNI/&gt;

[[File:Eugène Atget (French - Chiffonier (Ragpicker) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A rag-picker in Paris, ca, 1899 - 1901.]]
A '''Rag-picker''', or '''Chiffonnier''', is term for someone who makes a living by rummaging through [[refuse]] in the streets to collect material for salvage. Scraps of cloth and paper could be turned into [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]], broken [[glass]] could be melted down and reused, and even dead cats and dogs could be [[Skinning|skinned]] to make clothes. 

The rag-pickers in 19th and early 20th Century did not [[recycle]] the materials themselves; they would simply collect whatever they could find and turn it over to a "master rag-picker" (usually a former rag-picker) who would, in turn, sell it&amp;mdash;generally by weight&amp;mdash;to wealthy investors with the means to convert the materials into something more profitable.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oHIDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA360&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Old and New Paris: Its history, its people, and its places|author=Edwards, Henry Sutherland|year=1893|pages=360–365|publisher=Cassell and Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Opinion|volume=36|chapter=The Workers in Waste Products|author=The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|year=1904|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=atYaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA782&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although it was solely a job for the lowest of the [[working classes]], rag-picking was considered an honest [[Job (role)|occupation]], more on the level of [[street sweeper]] than of a [[beggar]]. In Paris, for instance, rag-pickers were regulated by law: their operations were restricted to certain times of night, and they were required to return any unusually valuable items to the owner or to the authorities.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt; When [[Eugène Poubelle]] introduced the [[garbage can]] in 1884, he was criticized in the French newspapers for meddling with the rag-pickers' livelihoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynch, Hannah|year=1901|title=French life in town and country|publisher=Putnam|pages=278–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[sanitation]] and recycling programs ultimately caused the profession to decline, though it did not disappear entirely; [[rag and bone man|rag and bone men]] were still operating in the 1970s. 

Rag-picking is still widespread in [[Third World]] countries today, such as in [[Mumbai]], [[India]], where it offers the poorest in society around the rubbish and recycling areas a chance to earn a hand-to-mouth supply of money. In 2015, the Environment Minister of India declared a national award to recognise the service rendered by rag-pickers. The award, with a cash prize of Rs. 1.5 lakh, is for three best rag pickers and three associations involved in innovation of best practices. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/rag-pickers-services-will-be-recognised-by-government-to-give-national-award/article7382780.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship in waste management and recycling ==
Ragpicking has a positive impact on urban spaces with a weak waste management infrastructure. In India, the economic activity of ragpicking is worth about ₹3200 crore. India was also found to have a near-90% recycle rate for PET bottles, which could probably be attributed to ragpicking, given a lack of solid-waste management and under-developed waste collection and recycling culture in that country. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/india-recycles-90-of-its-pet-waste-outperforms-japan-europe-and-us-study/story-yqphS1w2GdlwMYPgPtyb2L.html NCL and PET Packaging Association for Clean Environment (PACE)　2017年2月&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electronics]], a '''rubber diode''' or '''V{{sub|BE}} multiplier''' is a [[Bipolar junction transistor]] circuit that serves as a [[voltage reference]].  It consists of one transistor and two [[resistor]]s, and the reference voltage across the circuit is determined by the selected resistor values and the base-to-emitter voltage (V{{sub|BE}}) of the transistor.  The circuit behaves as a [[voltage divider]], but with the voltage across the base-emitter resistor determined by the forward base-emitter junction voltage.

It is commonly used in the [[biasing]] of [[push-pull output]] stages of [[amplifier]]s, where one benefit is thermal compensation: The temperature-dependent variations in the multiplier's V{{sub|BE}}, can be made to match variations occurring in the V{{sub|BE}} of the power transistors by mounting to the same [[heat sink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crecraft |first1=David |last2=Gergely |first2=Stephen |date=May 21, 2002 |title=Analog Electronics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lS7qN6iHyBYC&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=vbe%20multiplier&amp;pg=PA188#v=onepage&amp;q=vbe%20multiplier&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |page=188 |isbn=0080475833 |access-date=August 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it is sometimes called a '''bias servo'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sound.whsites.net/amp_design.htm |title= Amplifier Design Guidelines |last= Elliott |first= Rod |date= 27 Dec 2006 |website= Elliott Sound Products |access-date= Aug 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5006">'''Schreinemaker's Analysis''' is the use of Schreinemaker's Rules to create a [[phase diagram]].

After applying Schreinemaker's Rules and creating a phase diagram, the resulting geometric figure will be [[thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] accurate, although the [[axe]]s will be undetermined. In order to determine the correct orientation of the [[geometric figure]] obtained through Schreinemaker's Rules, one must have additional information about the given [[chemical reaction|reactions]] or go through an analytical treatment of the thermodynamics of the relevant [[Phase (matter)|phases]].

==Metastable extensions==

Univariant lines are sometimes called [[chemical reaction|reaction]] lines. The extension of a univariant line through the invariant point is called the '''metastable extension'''. Univariant lines are usually drawn as a solid line while their metastable extensions are drawn as a dotted line.

Univariant lines and their metastable extensions are often labeled by putting in square brackets the phase that is absent from the reaction associated with the given univariant line. In other words, since every univariant line represents a [[chemical equilibrium]], these equilibrium curves are named with the phase (or phases) that is ''not'' involved in the equilibrium.

Take an example with four phases: A, B, C, D. If a univariant line is defined by the equilibrium reaction A+D←→C, this univariant line would be labeled [B], because the phase B is absent from the reaction A+D←→C.

==Morey-Schreinemaker Coincidence Theorem==

The '''Morey-Schreinemaker Coincidence Theorem''' states that for every univariant line that passes through the invariant point, one side is stable and the other is [[metastable]]. The invariant point marks the boundary of the stable and metastable segments of a reaction line.

===Phase Rule===

{{main|phase rule}}
An invariant point is defined as a representation of an invariant system (0 degrees of freedom by Gibbs' [[phase rule]]) by a point on a phase diagram.
A univariant line thus represents a univariant system with 1 degree of freedom. Two univariant lines can then define a divariant area with 2 degrees of freedom.

===Metastable Extensions Rule===

From the '''Morey-Schreinemaker Coincidence Theorem''', Schreinemaker's Rules can be determined. These rules can be used in the creation of an accurate [[phase diagram]] where both [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]] are [[intensive quantity|intensive]] thermodynamic variables.

There are many correct collections of "Schreinemaker's Rules" and the choice to use a given set of rules depends on the nature of the phase diagrams being created. Due to the phrasing of the Morey-Schreinemaker Coincidence Theorem, only one rule is essential to the Schreinemaker's Rules. This is the so-called '''metastable extensions rule''':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The metastable extension of the [phase-absent] reaction must fall in the sector in which that phase is stable in all possible assemblages.''&lt;ref&gt;Spear, Frank S. ''Metamorphic Phase Equilibria and Pressure-Temperature-Time Paths''. Washington, D.C: Mineralogical Society of America, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Generic_phase_diagram.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A generic phase diagram with unspecified axes; the invariant point is marked in red, metastable extensions labeled in blue, relevant reactions noted on stable ends of univariant lines.]]

This rule is geometrically sound in the construction of [[phase diagrams]] since for every metastable reaction, there must be a phase that is relatively stable. This phase must be the one which does not participate in the reaction and is therefore not consumed as a reactant or formed as a product, thus being "stable."

Some collections of '''Schreinemaker's Rules''' will contain the following, additional, basic statements:

* No assemblage has a stability area greater than 180°.
* All reactants and products are stable in the field where the reaction plots.
* The absent phase is unstable where the reaction plots.
* Complex reactions (high number of participating phases) ''usually'' lie within bounding, simple reactions defining the phase stability region.
* The simplest divariant region ''usually'' contains the most metastable extensions.
* If each stable and metastable reaction curve is labeled with the absent phase, then the order of the named curves as you proceed around the invariant point should cycle through all phases twice in order of their relative reaction components.

====Assemblages====
An '''assemblage''' is defined as the phases on one side of an equilibrium reaction. An assemblage can be either a single phase or a collection of phases.
In the example above with the equilibrium reaction A+D←→C, (A+D) is an assemblage as well as (C) on its own.

[[File:Slosh in Pool 20150719.jpg|thumb|Water sloshing in the swimming pool of a cruise ship undergoing pitching motion]]
In [[fluid dynamics]], '''slosh''' refers to the movement of [[liquid]] inside another object (which is, typically, also undergoing motion).

Strictly speaking, the liquid must have a [[free surface]] to constitute a '''slosh dynamics''' problem, where the dynamics of the liquid can interact with the container to alter the system dynamics significantly.&lt;ref&gt;Moiseyev, N.N. &amp; V.V. Rumyantsev. "Dynamic Stability of Bodies Containing Fluid." Springer-Verlag, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Important examples include [[propellant]] slosh in [[spacecraft]] tanks and [[rocket]]s (especially upper stages), and the [[free surface effect]] (cargo slosh) in ships and trucks transporting liquids (for example oil and gasoline).
However, it has become common to refer to liquid motion in a completely filled tank, i.e. without a free surface, as "fuel slosh".{{Citation needed lead|date=August 2011}}

Such motion is characterized by "[[inertial wave]]s" and can be an important effect in spinning spacecraft dynamics. Extensive mathematical and empirical relationships have been derived to describe liquid slosh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Ibrahim| first=Raouf A.| title=Liquid Sloshing Dynamics: Theory and Applications| year=2005| publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521838856|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ctvhvH74ZzEC&amp;dq=liquid+slosh+ibrahim&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=liquid%20slosh%20ibrahim&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sloshing|last = Faltinsen|first = Odd M.|publisher = Cambridge University press|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0521881111|location = |pages = |last2 = Timokha|first2 = Alexander N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of analyses are typically undertaken using [[computational fluid dynamics]] and [[finite element methods]] to solve the [[fluid-structure interaction]] problem, especially if the solid container is flexible. Relevant fluid dynamics non-dimensional parameters include the [[Bond number]], the [[Weber number]], and the [[Reynolds number]].

Slosh is an important effect for spacecraft,&lt;ref&gt;Reyhanoglu, M. "Maneuvering control problems for a spacecraft with unactuated fuel slosh dynamics". Control Applications, 2003. Proc 2003 IEEE Conference. Volume 1, 23–25 June 2003, pp695-699.&lt;/ref&gt; ships,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and some [[aircraft]]. Slosh was a factor in the [[Falcon 1]] second test flight anomaly, and has been implicated in various other spacecraft anomalies, including a near-disaster&lt;ref&gt;Veldman, A.E.P. et al. "The Numerical Simulation of Liquid Sloshing On-Board Spacecraft." J. Comput. Phys. 224 (2007) 82-99.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous ([[NEAR Shoemaker]]) satellite.

Liquid slosh in [[microgravity]]&lt;ref&gt;Monti, R. "Physics of Fluids in Microgravity." CRC, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antar, B.N. &amp; V.S. Nuotio-Antar. "Fundamentals of Low Gravity Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer." CRC, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; is relevant to spacecraft, most commonly Earth-orbiting [[satellites]], and must take account of liquid [[surface tension]] which can alter the shape (and thus the [[eigenvalues]]) of the liquid slug. Typically, a large part of the mass fraction of a satellite is liquid propellant at/near Beginning of Life (BOL), and slosh can adversely affect satellite performance in a number of ways. For example, propellant slosh can introduce uncertainty in spacecraft attitude (pointing) which is often called [[jitter]]. Similar phenomena can cause [[pogo oscillation]] and can result in structural failure of space vehicle.

Another example is problematic interaction with the spacecraft Attitude Control System (ACS), especially for spinning satellites&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, C. "Behavior of Spinning Space Vehicles with Onboard Liquids." NASA GSFC Symposium, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; which can suffer [[resonance]] between slosh and [[nutation]], or adverse changes to the rotational [[inertia]].

Optimizations and sloshing reduction techniques in fuel tanks such as elliptical tank, rectangular, modified oval and generic tank shape have been performed in different filling levels using numerical, analytical and analogical analyses. Most of these studies concentrate on effects of baffles on sloshing while the influence of cross-section is completely ignored.&lt;ref name="ssdfss"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Talebitooti | first1 = R.| last2 = shojaeefard | first2 = M.H.| last3 = Yarmohammadisatri | first3 = Sadegh | year = 2015 | title = Shape design optimization of cylindrical tank using b-spline curves | url = | journal = computer &amp; fluids | volume = 109 | pages = 100–112 | doi= 10.1016/j.compfluid.2014.12.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical effects ==
Sloshing or shifting [[cargo]], water [[Sailing ballast|ballast]], or other liquid (e.g. from leaks or fire fighting) can cause disastrous [[capsize|capsizing]] in ships due to [[free surface effect]]; this can also affect trucks and aircraft.

The effect of slosh is used to limit the bounce of a [[roller hockey]] ball. Water slosh can significantly reduce the rebound height of a ball&lt;ref&gt;Sport ball for roller hockey; U.S. Patent 5516098; May 14, 1996; Jeffrey Aiello.&lt;/ref&gt; but some amounts of liquid seem to lead to a [[resonance]] effect. Many of the balls for roller hockey commonly available contain water to reduce the bounce height.

'''Solar Euromed''' is a high technology group based in [[France]] specialized in [[concentrated solar power]] technology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emerging-energy.com/uploadDocs/GlobalConcentratedSolarPowerMarketsandStrategies2010.pdf|work=Global Concentrated Solar Power Markets and Strategies 2010-2025. April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; in activity from 2007 to 2016.

The company provides proprietary [[concentrated solar power|solar thermal power systems]] which produce [[heat]] for [[power generation]] and [[List of industrial processes|industrial applications]] with the built-in ability to [[Energy storage|store energy]] and [[Electricity generation|supply electricity]] on demand, even after [[sunset]]. Solar Euromed's [[concentrated solar power|solar thermal technology]] is based on the concept of [[Solar thermal energy|direct steam generation]] and [[Optics|linear Fresnel optics]] and was developed together with the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] and the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|French Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solareuromed.com/sites/default/files/Les%20Echos_SEM%20pr%C3%AAt%20%C3%A0%20construire%20une%20centrale%20solaire%20en%20Corse_11_0.pdf Les Echos - Solar Euromed prêt à construire une centrale solaire en Corse]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since its inception, Solar Euromed has been an active promoter of [[concentrated solar power|CSP]] technology in [[Europe]] and has built a recognized expertise in this emerging field:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalkia.com/en/news-media/press-releases/2008-09-15,thermo-dynamic-solar-project.htm France's first thermo-dynamic solar project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724035942/http://www.dalkia.com/en/news-media/press-releases/2008-09-15,thermo-dynamic-solar-project.htm |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2007, Solar Euromed developed the Solenha project ultimately classified as [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/seveso/index.htm Seveso] enabling a greater knowledge&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solareuromed.com/sites/default/files/SEM_TR11_HIPT_001_print_0.pdf Solar Euromed - Hazard issues in Parabolic Trough Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[environmental impact assessment]] of [[Solar thermal energy|parabolic trough]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/terre/0101562941-solenha-retard-a-l-allumage Liberation - Solenha]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2009, the group launched its technology development plan funded by the French innovation fund [[:fr:Oséo|Oseo]] and the [[European Union]] which initially resulted in a Fresnel-based pilot plant located at the [[Themis (solar power plant)|Themis solar energy R&amp;D platform]] in the [[Pyreneans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tecsol.blogs.com/mon_weblog/2011/07/solar-euromed-poursuit-son-d%C3%A9veloppement-dans-le-solaire-%C3%A0-concentration.html Tecsol - Solar Euromed's development]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2010, the company signed a 2 GW agreement with the [[Sudan|Republic of Sudan]] for the development, construction and operation of CSP plants to be implemented over the next decade. Few weeks later, Solar Euromed signed a [[power purchase agreement]] for the realization of the first 250 MW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evwind.es/noticias.php?id_not=4915 REVE - Solar Euromed signed an agreement for a 2 GW Solar in Sudan]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011,  it secured in [[Corsica]] a [[construction permit]] for the implementation of the largest solar thermal power plant in France set to demonstrate Solar Euromed’s proprietary Fresnel-based technology at utility scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helioscsp.com/noticia.php?id_not=523 Helionoticias - Authorities award construction permit for the first CSP plant in France] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321184115/http://www.helioscsp.com/noticia.php?id_not=523 |date=2012-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 2015, the company was placed under [[administration (law)|administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.greenunivers.com/2016/01/y-a-t-il-un-repreneur-pour-solar-euromed-137700/|title=Y a-t-il un repreneur pour Solar Euromed ?|date=January 7, 2016 |author=Anne-Claire Poirier|website=greenunivers.com|access-date=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was finally shut down in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.bienpublic.com/edition-dijon-ville/2016/09/13/solar-euromed-a-ete-placee-en-liquidation-judiciaire|title=Solar Euromed a été placée en liquidation judiciaire|date=2016-09-13|access-date=2016-10-20|website=bienpublic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concentrated solar power==
[[Concentrated solar power|CSP]] technologies concentrate [[energy]] from the [[sun]]’s rays to heat a [[fluid]] to high temperatures. This heat is transformed into [[mechanical energy]] and then into [[electricity]]. Using the [[sun]] as a free source of [[energy]], structures made out of [[metal]] and [[glass]] and completely [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emission-free, [[Concentrated Solar Power]] is a [[sustainable]] and [[environmentally friendly]] solution to produce a [[Sustainable energy|clean]] and [[renewable]] energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtcc.org/2010/html/solar-euromed.html Responding to climate change 2010 - CSP – The fully sustainable solution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527113349/http://www.rtcc.org/2010/html/solar-euromed.html |date=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSP is a proven technology and the first plants began operating in [[California]] in the 80’s, spurred by federal and state tax incentives and mandatory long-term [[power purchase agreement|power purchase contracts]]. A drop in [[fossil fuel]] prices then led the federal and state governments to dismantle the [[policy]] framework that had supported the advancement of CSP. In 2006, the market re-emerged in [[Spain]] and the [[United States]], supported by changes in governmental policies favorable to [[renewable energies]] – and [[solar energy|solar]] in particular. CSP uses [[renewable]] [[Solar energy|solar resource]] to [[Electricity generation|generate electricity]] while producing no [[GHG emissions]] (SO&lt;small&gt;X&lt;/small&gt;, CO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;) with large scale power capacities. CSP plants can be combined with [[thermal storage]] capacity so as to avoid [[intermittency]] due to [[clouds]], or to provide the [[Electrical grid|grid]] with [[electricity]] in the [[evening]], during [[peak hours]], and throughout the [[night]]. CSP plants can also provide power generation during off-solar hours thanks to [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridization]] either with [[gas]] or [[biomass]]. While the bulk of CSP electricity will come from large, on-grid power plants, these technologies also show significant potential for supplying other specific needs such as [[water desalination]], [[off-grid]] [[power generation|power]], [[combined heat and power generation]], [[process heat]], oil &amp; gas [[pump]]ing, and [[Hydrogen economy|solar fuels generation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/papers/2010/csp_roadmap.pdf International Energy Agency CSP Roadmap ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Solar Euromed's technology use long and narrow segments of [[mirror]] that pivot to [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] the [[sunlight]] onto a fixed [[Solar thermal collector|absorber tube]] located at the common focal line of the reflectors. A secondary reflector enables to have a higher [[heat flux]] and [[homogeneous]] [[heating]] of the absorber tube which can generate [[temperatures]] up to 450&amp;nbsp;°C. Solar Euromed's solutions include a large scale assembly of Fresnel reflector modules working with direct steam generation at high temperature, a thermal storage capacity, a scheme of assembly enabling [[farming]] under the reflectors due to the high positioning of the structures, and the use of recyclable materials limiting waste during the dismantling and the [[environmental impact]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neo-planete.com/2011/06/22/solar-euromed-developpe-les-centrales-solaires-a-concentration/ Solar Euromed CEO's interview on technology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electroiq.com/photovoltaics/2011/08/1474394352/french-solar-euromed-launches-fund-raising-for-solar-project-in-corsica.html Renewables news network - French Solar Euromed launches fund-raising for solar project in Corsica] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120905234112/http://www.electroiq.com/photovoltaics/2011/08/1474394352/french-solar-euromed-launches-fund-raising-for-solar-project-in-corsica.html |date=2012-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advantages of the technology'''

Fresnel technology has CSP’s best land-to-electricity [[ratio]] due to a compact [[design]] and the [[usability]] of space below support structures. This technology is also considered to be cheaper to implement and allows a strong [[construction]] modularity. Fresnel system requires flat or less-shaped [[mirror]]s and facilitates Direct Steam Generation, eliminating the need for costly [[Coolant|heat transfer fluids]] and [[heat exchangers]]. Moreover, [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|operations and maintenance]] are easy, hence, the associated [[cost]]s are moderate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenunivers.com/2011/07/solar-euromed-monte-en-pression-sur-le-solaire-thermodynamique-premium-60049/ Greenunivers.com - CSP technology by Solar Euromed]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pilot Plant'''

In [[partnership]] with two leading French R&amp;D centers ([[CNRS]] and [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|CEA]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solareuromed.com/en/partners/science-and-technology Solar Euromed - R&amp;D partnerships]&lt;/ref&gt; Solar Euromed has implemented this landmark technology development into a fully instrumented MW-size pilot plant called Augustin Fresnel 1 located in the French [[Pyreneans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solareuromed.com/en/vision/innovate/augustin-fresnel-1 Augustin Fresnel 1 official description]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alba Nova 1==

Located at [[Ghisonaccia]] in [[Corsica]], Alba Nova 1 is Solar Euromed's [[Concentrated solar power|CSP]] demonstration plant for which a [[construction permit]] was already secured for a net [[Electric power|power output]] of 12 MW producing [[electricity]] equivalent of the consumption of 10 000 households, thus serving as a bridge between the pilot phase and the anticipated deployment in the [[MENA]] region. It provides an optimized integration of [[agricultural]] activities under the supporting structures and a state-of-the art [[eco-friendly]] overall [[design]]. It is the first CSP project to be authorized in France since more than 30 years&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120913083021/http://www.tenerrdis.fr/rep-edito/p-456.html Tenerrdis - Permit granted for Solar Euromed]&lt;/ref&gt; and serves as a reference for the [[Energy transformation|energy conversion]] and [[economic]] performance of Solar Euromed’s Fresnel proprietary technology. Due to its [[island|insularity]], [[Corsica]] has specific energetic constraints to operate with limited connections to an external network, protection of [[Natural environment|environment]], [[fire]], and has to manage the downward looking lifecycle of two fossil-powered thermal [[power plants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corsematin.com/article/haute-corse/une-centrale-solaire-en-projet Corse Matin newspaper - Une centrale solaire en projet]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3013">'''Solar bonds''' are [[Municipal bond|municipal]] [[revenue bond]]s issued to provide low-interest financing for lower-cost accelerated development of local [[renewable energy]] technologies such as [[solar power]]. 
 
==History==
The first solar bond authority was drafted by [[Paul Douglas Fenn]], creator of [[Community Choice Aggregation]], and approved by [[San Francisco, California]] voters in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.local.org/hbondlnk.html&lt;/ref&gt; Under "solar neighborhoods" approach, municipal governments would enter into multi-decade community-wide [[power purchase agreement]]s with competitive suppliers and issue solar bonds, or "H Bonds", to finance the new supplier's rollout of local renewable energy and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] measures, offering municipal bond financing to residents and businesses, the debt for which would be repaid on monthly electric bills - an approach that has come to be called "on-bill financing." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financing Green Projects|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2008/03/financing-green-projects-51766|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City of San Francisco enshrined solar bonds in its Community Choice Aggregation program in 2004 when it adopted an ordinance combining the City's authority to procure power for its residents and businesses with its authority to issue revenue bonds under the solar bond authority. Fenn drafted the ordinance (86-04, 2004) for sponsoring supervisor [[Tom Ammiano]], who had also sponsored placing the solar bond authority on the 2001 ballot, and Fenns' company, Local Power Inc., went on to draft a 2007 implementation plan and 2013 business model to implement the $1 billion project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Francisco's Green Power Plan Still Stalled by Corporate Interests a Decade Later|url=http://truth-out.org/news/item/18347-considered-a-national-example-san-franciscos-green-power-plan-has-struggled-for-a-decade-to-overcome-opposition-from-monopoly-corporate-interests|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local Power also contributed substantially to Sonoma county's Sonoma Clean Power program which has a similar structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bottom Line|url=http://www.metroactive.com/bohemian/11.23.11/news-1147.html|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=$1 Million RESCO Grant Approved for Energy Independence Projects|url=http://scwa2.computergrafixco.com/eNews/index.asp?issue=5/1/2009&amp;campaign=Enews&amp;article=2113|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from creating a new generation of Community Choice Aggregations, San Francisco's solar bond authority spawned the subsequent appearance of both public and private financing of customer-owned solar and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] measures, including [[PACE financing]] and the solar [[power purchase agreement]] or PPA, transforming the photovoltaics industry in the United States.

This page describes some parameters used to characterize the properties of the '''thermal boundary layer''' formed by a heated (or cooled) fluid moving along a heated (or cooled) wall.  In many ways, the thermal boundary layer description parallels the [[boundary layer|velocity (momentum) boundary layer]] description first conceptualized by [[Ludwig Prandtl]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Prandtl, “Über Flüssigkeitsbewegung bei sehr kleiner Reibung,” Verhandlungen des Dritten Internationalen Mathematiker-Kongresses in Heidelberg 1904, A. Krazer, ed., Teubner, Leipzig, (1905) 484–491.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consider a fluid of uniform temperature &lt;math&gt;T_o&lt;/math&gt; and velocity &lt;math&gt;u_o&lt;/math&gt; impinging onto a stationary plate uniformly heated to a temperature &lt;math&gt;T_s&lt;/math&gt;.  Assume the flow and the plate are semi-infinite in the positive/negative direction perpendicular to the &lt;math&gt;x-y&lt;/math&gt; plane.  As the fluid flows along the wall, the fluid at the wall surface satisfies a [[no-slip boundary condition]] and has zero velocity, but as you move away from the wall, the velocity of the flow asymptotically approaches the free stream velocity &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The temperature at the solid wall is &lt;math&gt;T_s&lt;/math&gt; and gradually changes to &lt;math&gt;T_o&lt;/math&gt; as one moves toward the free stream of the fluid.  It is impossible to define a sharp point at which the thermal boundary layer fluid or the velocity boundary layer fluid becomes the free stream, yet these layers have a well-defined characteristic thickness given by &lt;math&gt;\delta_T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta_v&lt;/math&gt;.  The parameters below provide a useful definition of this characteristic, measurable thickness for the thermal boundary layer.  Also included in this boundary layer description are some parameters useful in describing the shape of the thermal boundary layer.

== 99% Thermal Boundary Layer thickness ==
The '''thermal boundary layer thickness''', '''&lt;math&gt;\delta_T&lt;/math&gt;''',  is the distance across a boundary layer from the wall to a point where the flow temperature has essentially reached the 'free stream' temperature, &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;.  This distance is defined normal to the wall in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-direction.  The thermal boundary layer thickness is customarily defined as the point in the boundary layer, &lt;math&gt;y_{99}&lt;/math&gt;, where the temperature &lt;math&gt;T(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; reaches 99% of the free stream value &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta_T = y_{99}&lt;/math&gt;   such that  &lt;math&gt;T(x,y_{99})&lt;/math&gt; = 0.99 &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;
at a position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; along the wall.  In a real fluid, this quantity can be estimated by measuring the temperature profile at a position &lt;math&gt;x  
&lt;/math&gt; along the wall.  The temperature profile is the temperature as a function of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; at a fixed &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; position.

For [[laminar flow]] over a flat plate a zero incidence, the thermal boundary layer thickness is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Schlichting, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta_T = \delta_v \mathrm{Pr}^{-1/3}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta_T = 5.0 \sqrt{ {\nu  x}\over u_0} \mathrm{Pr}^{-1/3}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Pr}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Prandtl Number]]
:&lt;math&gt;\delta_v&lt;/math&gt; is the thickness of the [[boundary layer thickness|velocity boundary layer thickness]] &lt;ref&gt;Schlichting, p.140.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; is the freestream velocity
:&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the distance downstream from the start of the boundary layer
:&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[kinematic viscosity]]

For [[turbulent flow]] over a flat plate, the thickness of the thermal boundary layer that is formed is not determined by thermal diffusion, but instead, it is random fluctuations in the outer region of the boundary layer of the fluid that is the driving force determining thermal boundary layer thickness.  Thus the thermal boundary layer thickness for turbulent flow does not depend on the [[Prandtl number]] but instead on the [[Reynolds number]].  Hence, the turbulent thermal boundary layer thickness is given approximately by the turbulent velocity [[boundary layer thickness]] expression&lt;ref&gt;Schlichting, p. 638.&lt;/ref&gt; given by:
:&lt;math&gt; \delta_T \approx \delta \approx 0.37x/ {\mathrm{Re}_x}^{1/5} &lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;{\mathrm{Re}_x}= u_0 x/\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Reynolds number]]

This turbulent boundary layer thickness formula assumes 1) the flow is turbulent right from the start of the boundary layer and 2) the turbulent boundary layer behaves in a geometrically similar manner (i.e. the velocity profiles are geometrically similar along the flow in the x-direction, differing only by stretching factors in &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlichting, p.152.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Neither one of these assumptions is true for the general turbulent boundary layer case so care must be exercised in applying this formula.

== Thermal Displacement Thickness ==

The '''thermal displacement thickness''', '''&lt;math&gt;\beta^*&lt;/math&gt;''' may be thought of in terms of the difference between a real fluid and a hypothetical fluid with thermal diffusion turned off but with velocity &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; and temperature &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;.  With no thermal diffusion, the temperature drop is abrupt.  The thermal displacement thickness is the distance by which the hypothetical fluid surface would have to be moved in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-direction to give the same integrated temperature as occurs between the wall and the reference plane at &lt;math&gt;\delta_T&lt;/math&gt; in the real fluid.  It is a direct analog to the velocity displacement thickness which is often described in terms of an equivalent shift of a hypothetical inviscid fluid (see Schlichting&lt;ref&gt;Schlichting, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; for velocity displacement thickness).

The definition of the thermal displacement thickness for incompressible flow is based on the integral of the reduced temperature:

:&lt;math&gt; {\beta^*}= \int_0^\infty {\theta(x,y) \,\mathrm{d}y}&lt;/math&gt;
 
where the dimensionless temperature is &lt;math&gt;\theta(x,y) = (T(x,y)-T_0)/(T_s-T_0)&lt;/math&gt;.  In a [[wind tunnel]], the velocity and temperature profiles are obtained by measuring the velocity and temperature at many discrete &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-values at a fixed &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-position.  The thermal displacement thickness can then be estimated by [[numerical integration|numerically integrating]] the scaled temperature profile.
  
== Moment Method ==
A relatively new method&lt;ref&gt;Weyburne, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weyburne, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; for describing the thickness and shape of the thermal boundary layer utilizes the [[Moment (mathematics)|moment method]] commonly used to describe a random variable's [[probability distribution]].  The moment method was developed from the observation that the plot of the second derivative of the thermal profile for laminar flow over a plate looks very much like a [[Gaussian distribution]] curve.&lt;ref&gt;Weyburne, 2006, p. 1680.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is straightforward to cast the properly scaled thermal profile into a suitable integral kernel.

The thermal profile central moments are defined as:
:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa_n} = {1\over\beta^*}\int_0^\infty { (y- m_T)^n  \theta(x,y) \mathrm{d}y}&lt;/math&gt;
where the mean location, &lt;math&gt;m_T&lt;/math&gt;, is given by: 
:&lt;math&gt; m_T = {1\over\beta^*}\int_0^\infty { y \theta(x,y)  \mathrm{d}y}&lt;/math&gt;

There are some advantages to also include descriptions of moments of the boundary layer profile derivatives with respect to the height above the wall.  Consider the first derivative temperature profile central moments given by:
:&lt;math&gt; {\epsilon_n} = \int_0^\infty { (y-{\beta^*})^n {d \theta(x,y) \over dy} \mathrm{d}y}&lt;/math&gt;
where the mean location is the thermal displacement thickness &lt;math&gt;\beta^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally the second derivative temperature profile central moments are given by:
:&lt;math&gt; {\phi_n} = \mu\int_0^\infty { (y-{\mu})^n {d^2  \theta(x,y) \over dy^2} \mathrm{d}y}&lt;/math&gt;
where the mean location, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:
:&lt;math&gt; {1 \over \mu} = -\left( \frac{d\theta(x,y) }{d y}\right)_{y=0}&lt;/math&gt;
  
With the moments and the thermal mean location defined, the boundary layer thickness and shape can be described in terms of the thermal boundary layer width ([[variance]]), thermal [[Skewness|skewnesses]], and thermal excess ([[Kurtosis|excess kurtosis]]).  For the Pohlhausen solution for laminar flow on a heated flat plate,&lt;ref&gt;Schlichting, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; it is found that thermal boundary layer thickness defined as &lt;math&gt;\delta_T = m_T + 4\sigma_T&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_T=\kappa_2^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, tracks the 99% thickness very well.&lt;ref&gt;Weyburne, 2018, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  

For laminar flow, the three different moment cases all give similar values for the thermal boundary layer thickness.  For turbulent flow, the thermal boundary layer can be divided into a region near the wall where thermal diffusion is important and an outer region where thermal diffusion effects are mostly absent.  Taking a cue from the [[Boundary layer|boundary layer energy balance equation]], the second derivative boundary layer moments, &lt;math&gt;{\phi_n}&lt;/math&gt; track the thickness and shape of that portion of the thermal boundary layer where [[thermal diffusivity]] &lt;math&gt;{\alpha }&lt;/math&gt; is significant.  Hence the moment method makes it possible to track and quantify the region where thermal diffusivity is important using &lt;math&gt;{\phi_n}&lt;/math&gt; moments whereas the overall thermal boundary layer is tracked using &lt;math&gt;{\epsilon_n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\kappa_n}&lt;/math&gt; moments.

Calculation of the derivative moments without the need to take derivatives is simplified by using integration by parts to reduce the moments to simply integrals based on the thermal displacement thickness kernel:
:&lt;math&gt; {k_n}= \int_0^\infty {y^n\theta(x,y) \,\mathrm{d}y}&lt;/math&gt;
This means that the second derivative skewness, for example, can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{T} = \phi_3/\phi_2^{3/2} = (2\mu^3 - 6\beta^*\mu^2 + 6\mu k_1)/(-\mu^2 + 2\mu\beta^*)^{3/2} &lt;/math&gt;

The tower sections weigh approximately 90&amp;nbsp;tonnes in total with the tower and blades combined weighing 125 tonnes. On average the blades turn at 16.2 rpm. There are four levels in a turbine and it takes about five minutes to get to the top.

Each wind turbine produces on average 24 [[megawatt hour]]s of power each day. On a windy day three wind turbines can power the whole of Clare and the whole wind farm can power up to 163,000 homes or 5 to 10% of South Australia.

The wind farm is planned to be upgraded with six new turbines.&lt;ref name="pgc"/&gt;

'''Whittle Shortline''' is a [[toy]] company owned and operated in the [[United States]].

== History ==

During the mid-1990s, former [[US Air Force]] pilot Mike Whitworth received a compound [[mitre saw]] as a gift from his wife, ostensibly for doing [[home improvement]] projects.

The saw sat unused for almost two years, when Whitworth got the inspiration to produce toy trains for friends and family. By 1997, word of his craftsmanship had reached local retailers, who in turn asked that he make the wooden trains on a professional basis.

In 1999 the production moved from the family home some miles to the historic building of the [[Frisco Hotel]] in [[Valley Park, Missouri|Valley Park]], a suburb of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. By 2005 most of the production was moved north to the city of Louisiana, Missouri.

In the recent wake of the [[2007 Chinese export recalls|recalls]] of many Chinese-made consumer goods (including toys),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=25363|title = Recall on Thomas the Tank Engine Toys|author = Gil McClanahan | date = 2007-06-19|work = WOWK-TV| accessdate = 2008-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whittle Shortline have seen a heightening of interest in their products.

== Products ==
[[Image:Toytrain.jpg|thumb|right|A colorful engine patterned from a [[Chessie System]] [[EMD GP40-2|GP40-2]], one of many wooden toy trains offered by Whittle Shortline.]]
Wooden toy trains and accessories are their specialty. These are non-motorized, and suitable for children. The cars and [[locomotive]]s [[Railway coupling|couple]] together using small [[magnet]]s, and are easy to manipulate. Whittle Shortline differ from their peers in that most of their trains are patterned from [[prototype]] [[North America]]n [[railroad]] equipment. The company proudly state their products as being '[[Made in the USA]]'.

The high quality woods used make Whittle Shortline toys more expensive than many other brands that use the same type of track.  However, they are compatible with brands such as [[BRIO]] and [[Thomas the Tank Engine]].

Aside from their standard line of wooden trains, Whittle Shortline also offer special versions of their toys.

=== Holiday car series ===
Each year since 2002, the company has offered a freight car decorated in a colorful [[holiday]] theme aimed at collectors. Typically featuring a [[boxcar]], although the 2002 and 2005 release saw a gift-adorned [[flatcar]] and [[hot cocoa]]-themed [[Tank car|tanker car]], respectively.

=== The Little Engine That Could ===
In 2006, the company released a wooden toy train line based upon [[The Little Engine That Could]], as a domestic alternative to [[Thomas the Tank Engine]].

=== Mega Trains ===
Whittle Shortline introduced in 2007 a line of 'Mega Trains'. These featured greatly enlarged locomotives and rolling stock, while retaining compatibility with standard wooden track.

The 12 [[megawatt]] (MW) '''Wyandot Solar Facility''' is a [[solar photovoltaic]] power plant completed in 2010, located in [[Salem Township, Wyandot County, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;Solar Energy Industries Association (2010).  [http://www.seia.org/galleries/pdf/Major%20Solar%20Projects.pdf Utility-Scale Solar Projects in the United States]&lt;/ref&gt; This system uses 159,200 panels spread over {{convert|83.9|acre}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pseg.com/wyandot/index.jsp Press kit]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Juwi|Juwi Solar]] developed the Wyandot Solar Facility and Vaughn Industries, based in Wyandot County, was the primary construction contractor. Most of the construction jobs created by the project went to Ohio residents. [[First Solar]] supplied the solar panels from their manufacturing plant in Perrysburg, Ohio.&lt;ref name=govmon&gt;[http://www.thegovmonitor.com/world_news/united_states/ohio-opens-states-largest-solar-farm-in-upper-sandusky-37439.html Ohio Opens States Largest Solar Farm In Upper Sandusky] (August 24, 2010), ''GovMonitor''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 24, 2010, Ohio Governor [[Ted Strickland]] joined The Public Service Enterprise Group, Ohio State University President Dr. E. Gordon Gee, and other local leaders to open the solar facility.&lt;ref name=govmon/&gt;
