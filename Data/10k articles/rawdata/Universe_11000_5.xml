The '''Kalamazoo Tornado of 1980''' struck downtown [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], on Tuesday, May 13, 1980. The tornado, which touched down at 4:09&amp;nbsp;pm, was rated F3 on the [[Fujita scale]].  The tornado killed 5&amp;nbsp;people and injured 79.  Damage was estimated at $50,000,000.&lt;ref name="rootsweb"&gt;{{cite web | title=Kalamazoo 1980 Tornado |work=Kalamazoo County, Michigan, Genealogy and Local History | url= http://www.rootsweb.com/~mikalama/tornado.htm | accessdate=July 30, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080224224212/http://www.rootsweb.com/~mikalama/tornado.htm |archivedate=February 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;

A series of ten explosions took place on April 22, 1992, in the downtown district of Analco Colonia Atlas in [[Guadalajara]] city, [[Jalisco]] state, Mexico.  Numerous [[gasoline]] explosions in the [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] system and fires over four hours destroyed {{convert|8|km}} of streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_lnqNFJPOcC|title=Managing Disaster Risk in Mexico: Market Incentives for Mitigation Investment|last=Kreimer|first=Alcira|date=1999|publisher=World Bank Publications|isbn=9780821344910|page=44|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gante Street was the most damaged. By the accounting of  [[Lloyd's of London]], the reported number of people killed was about 252 people although many estimate that the catastrophe actually caused at least 1000 deaths.&lt;ref name=aria.dev&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/wp-content/files_mf/FD_3543_guadalajara_1992_ang.pdf|title=Explosion of hydrocarbons in an urban sewerage network|last=|first=|date=December 2007|website=|publisher=|access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 500 to 600 people were missing,&lt;ref name=aria.dev/&gt; nearly 500 were injured and 15,000 were left homeless. The estimated monetary damage ranges between $300 million and $1 billion. The affected areas can be recognized by the more [[modern architecture]] in the areas that were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V112/N22/mexico.22w.html |author=Peter Eisner |title=Nine officials charged in sewer-line explosions case |work=The Tech |publisher=Tech.mit.edu |date=April 28, 1992 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four days before the explosion, residents started complaining of a strong gas-like smell coming from the sewers which became progressively more pungent over the course of those days. They were experiencing symptoms such as stinging in their eyes and throats; and nausea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/sewers-explode-in-guadalajara|title=Sewers explode in Guadalajara - Apr 22, 1992 - HISTORY.com|newspaper=HISTORY.com|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some residents even found gasoline coming out of their water pipes. City workers were dispatched to check the sewers and found dangerously high levels of gasoline fumes. However, the city mayor did not feel it was necessary to evacuate the city because he felt that there was no risk of an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semp.us/publications/biot_reader.php?BiotID=356 |work=SEMP Biot #356 |title=The Guadalajara 1992 Sewer Gas Explosion Disaster |publisher=Semp.us |date=May 3, 2006 |accessdate=2015-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210235229/http://www.semp.us/publications/biot_reader.php?BiotID=356 |archivedate=February 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology of events ==

Before the explosions, on April 19, Gante Street residents reported a strong stench of gasoline and plumes of white smoke coming out from the sewers to the City of Guadalajara. The next day, workers of the City Council and [[Civil Protection]] commenced two days of investigations in Gante Street; they found high levels of gasoline among other hydrocarbons, but announced it was not necessary to evacuate the area. At 10am on April 22, manhole covers in the street began to bounce and columns of white smoke started coming out of them.

At 10:05 on April 22, the first two explosions were recorded, the first on the corner of Calzada Independencia and Aldama Street, and the second at the intersection of Gante and 20 De Noviembre. A minute later the first call was received on the 060 Emergency Line and was forwarded to automatic voice messenger. A third explosion at 10:08 resulted in a bus, belonging to the Tuts Company, being projected through the air on the corner of Gante and Nicolas Bravo. Four minutes later another explosion was registered in Gonzalez Gallo Avenue. At 10:15 factory workers along Gonzalez Gallo Avenue began to evacuate, just before rescue teams and volunteers began to arrive in areas affected by the explosions. At 10:23 the fifth explosion occurred, at the intersection of Gante and Calzada del Ejercito. At 10:29 evacuations began in the Mexicaltzingo neighborhood, two minutes before the sixth explosion was recorded at the intersection of 5 De Febrero and Rio Bravo.

At 10:43 the seventh explosion occurred, at the corner of Ghent Street and Silverio Garcia. Just after more rescue teams arrived in the affected areas, the eighth explosion occurred at 11:02, at the intersection of Rio Nilo Avenue and the Rio Grande. After this explosion the neighborhoods of Atlas, Alamo Industrial, El Rosario, Quinta Velarde and Fraccionamiento Revolución; and the center of the municipality of [[Tlaquepaque]]; were evacuated. The last two explosions were at 11:16, one at the intersection of Rio Alamos and Rio Pecos, and the other at González Gallo and Rio Suchiate. In the afternoon, the fear of further tragedies made people across the [[Guadalajara Metropolitan Area|Guadalajara Metro Area]] uncover manholes for any remaining gases to escape. Residents of neighborhoods such as Zona Industrial, 18 De marzo, Fresno, 8 De Julio, Ferrocarril, La Nogalera, Morelos, Echeverria, Polanco, 5 de mayo and Miravalle are told to be aware of any unusual events.

After the explosions, there was great panic on April 25 among residents of the neighborhoods 5 De Mayo, el Dean, Echeverría and Polanco; firefighters asked people to avoid lighting any flames, due to a strong smell of gas. It was later confirmed to be a leak in a [[Pemex]] pipe.

==Investigation==
An investigation into the disaster found that there were two precipitating causes:

* New water pipes, made of [[zinc]]-coated [[iron]], were built too close to an existing [[steel]] gasoline pipeline. The underground humidity caused these materials to create an [[electrolytic]] reaction, akin to that which occurs inside a [[zinc-carbon battery]]. As the reaction proceeded it eventually caused the steel pipe to [[corrosion|corrode]], creating a hole in the pipeline that permitted gasoline to leak into the ground and into the main sewer pipe.
* The sewer pipe had been recently rebuilt into a U-shape so that the city could expand its underground metro railway system.  Usually sewers are built in a slope so that gravity helps move waste along. In order to get the U-shape to work, an [[inverted siphon]] was placed so that fluids could be pushed against gravity. The design was flawed, however. While liquids were successfully pumped through, gases were not, and gas fumes would build up.

==Aftermath==
In the aftermath, city officials and corporations blamed each other. Some people initially thought a cooking oil manufacturing company was leaking [[hexane]], a flammable liquid similar to (and a component of) gasoline, into the sewers, but this was later found to be erroneous. Numerous arrests were made in an attempt to indict those responsible for the blasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/cases/17-03.html |title=Maria Estela Acosta Hernandez et. al. v. Mexico |publisher=University of Minnesota |date=February 20, 2003 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four [[Pemex]] officials were indicted and charged, on the basis of negligence. Ultimately, however, these people were cleared of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975488,00.html |title=Pemex Is Blamed for The Sewer Explosion|publisher=Time.com |date=1992-05-11 |work=Time |accessdate=2014-04-20}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the survivors that were affected by the explosions started a group called "La Asociacion 22 de Abril en Guadalajara" (the association of April 22 of Guadalajara).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pagina24jalisco.com.mx/local/2014/05/07/niega-lilia-ruiz-abusos-contra-afectados-del-22-de-abril/|title=Niega Lilia Ruiz abusos contra afectados del 22 de abril {{!}} Página 24 Jalisco|website=pagina24jalisco.com.mx|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign was started by a survivor of the explosions named Lilia Ruiz Chávez, who as a result of the explosions lost her leg as well as her home. She started the group that has a total of 80 members not only because no one was convicted of this preventable incident but also because the victims of this tragedy were not receiving any compensation or assistance due to injuries sustained or loss as a result of the accident. The victims of this tragedy not only lost their homes but also their health and many lost loved ones as well. Although they are aware that no amount of money will bring back their relatives as states Chavez, the tragedy left them unable to care for themselves let alone afford their medication as a consequence of the incident. Chavez as well as the other survivors have been fighting for 24 years now for justice to be served. Because of  the constant struggle and pressure from the victims toward [[Pemex]], the company that was initially blamed for the incident, finally agreed to pay out 40 million pesos to the group. Although Pemex claims this is a donation and no way does it mean they are taking blame for the incident.

The '''2009 European floods''' were a series of natural disasters that took place in June 2009 in [[Central Europe]]. [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Turkey]] were all affected. The heavy rains caused overflowing of the rivers [[Oder River|Oder]], [[Vistula]], [[Elbe]] and [[Danube]]. At least 12 people were killed in the [[Czech Republic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Ten dead in Czech floods, central Europe on alert | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE55O4O820090625 | work= | publisher=Reuters.com | date= 2009-06-25| accessdate=2009-06-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090629170650/https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE55O4O820090625| archivedate= 29 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one in [[Poland]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}.

It moved slowly over the [[Adriatic Sea]] toward the [[Black Sea]] forming an ''upper low'' – despite the typical muggy movement from the southeast and build-up of precipitation from the east and northeast, a classic flood situation that was missing the [[Genoa low]] of a ground low core.

The Quinton Low formed from June 20–22, through constriction of an upper low over the Alps towards the southeast.  An Atlantic infusion of cold air had brought heavy precipitation&lt;ref name="wetterzentrale GFS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wetterzentrale.de/topkarten/fsavneur.html|title=Wetter : Wetterzentrale : Top Karten : Prognose - GFS Europa|publisher=Wetterzentrale.de|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Prognose_20090618.gif|format=GIF|title=Barometric map image|publisher=Met.fu-berlin.de|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with snowfall down to elevations of 1500m.

Locally, this phase was similar to the [[2005 European floods]], although in that year there was a faster rise.&lt;ref name="SN 2009-06-24-7"/&gt;

Starting on June 25, the low moved over the [[Black Sea]].  On June 25 and 26,&lt;ref&gt;[http://imkhp2.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de/~muehr/satpicsf/FV/EUR/200906251200_met8.jpg] {{dead link|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the precipitation was concentrated in the area around [[Belgrade]] and Southern Hungary.

The stable and stationary weather situation did not disintegrate until after June 29.  However, the air mass over Central and Eastern Europe remained extremely moist and unstable such that heavy thunderstorms repeatedly drove further local floods in the following days.  Local areas of heavy rain of up to 50mm in a few hours were recorded across Central Europe until the first two weeks of July.  The end of the weather phase did not occur until the passing of the low ''Rainer'' over England and the North Sea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Prognose_20090703.gif|format=GIF|title=Barometric map image|publisher=Met.fu-berlin.de|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Prognose_20090704.gif|format=GIF|title=Barometric map image|publisher=Met.fu-berlin.de|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and low ''Steffen'' over Southern Scandinavia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Prognose_20090708.gif|format=GIF|title=Barometric map image|publisher=Met.fu-berlin.de|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://imkhp2.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de/~muehr/satpicsf/DWD/2009_IR/200907081200ir.jpg]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020120943/http://imkhp2.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de/~muehr/satpicsf/DWD/2009_IR/200907081200ir.jpg |date=October 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which the slowly advancing weather system surrounded from July 3 to the 9th.

===Austria===
On Tuesday June 23, the strong rise began to impact the tributaries that lead from the south to the Danube, and flood warnings were triggered on the night of June 24 in many places in the [[Upper Austrian Prealps|Upper]] and [[Vienna Woods|Lower Austrian Prealps]].&lt;ref name ="fireworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fireworld.at/cms/story.php?id=22502&amp;menu=4|title=sterreich: Hochwasser-Einstze Juni 2009|publisher=Fireworld.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The state warning centers were reinforced.  By the morning of June 24, about 4,000 firefighters were already operating in [[Upper Austria]] and [[Lower Austria]].  Armed Forces helicopters were also in use.

In Upper Austria, the [[Krems (Lower Austria)|Krems]] and [[Traun (river)|Traun]] rivers partially came together at the banks.  The level of the tributaries was rising while the Danube was steady.  Seven districts in Lower Austria were already affected.  The rivers [[Ybbs]], Melk, Erlauf, [[Traisen (river)|Traisen]], and Perschling were especially flooded.  [[Ybbsitz]] had been closed off from the outside world since 3AM.&lt;ref name="SN 2009-06-30-8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salzburg.com/nwas/archiv_artikel.php?xm=3509205|title=Archiv der Salzburger Nachrichten - SALZBURG.COM|author=Salzburger Nachrichten|publisher=Salzburg.com|accessdate=28 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709140931/http://www.salzburg.com/nwas/archiv_artikel.php?xm=3509205|archive-date=2009-07-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the Danube (Strudengau, [[Wachau]]), the available mobile flood prevention equipment was assembled as much as possible.  In [[Styria]], only individual actions were reported, mainly pumping operations but also elimination of mudslides.

By June 25, the persistent rainfall was over.  Instead, increasingly short heavy rains with large masses of water were recorded.  Since the ground was no longer receptive to water, the aftereffects of these precipitations were similarly devastating.  In Upper Austria, the situation calmed because the level of the tributaries was slowly falling towards normal levels.  In [[Steyr]], the level had sunk to the quay, 1.4m less than the previous day.  The Danube had reached its highest level of 6.9m overnight in [[Mauthausen]] and also sank slowly.  The center of the flood shifted towards Wachau as the precipitation itself moved towards the east.  253 of the 326 fire departments in [[Burgenland]] were called on for flood operations within 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfkdo-gs.at/images/downloads/20090624_pa_unwetter_lfv.pdf |format=PDF |title=Unwettereinsätze im Burgenland : Größter Einsatz in der Geschichte des Landesfeuerwehrverbandes 253 der 326 burgenländischen Feuerwehren im Einsatz |publisher=Bkfdo-gs.at |accessdate=28 November 2014 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Albertina, Vienna|Albertina Museum]] in [[Vienna]] evacuated 950,000 artworks by artists such as Monet and Renoir.&lt;ref name="At least 10 die in Czech floods"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0625/breaking18.htm|title=At least 10 die in Czech floods|date=2009-06-25|accessdate=2009-06-29|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, further floods affected areas stretching from [[Mostviertel]] to Burgenland, particularly in the [[Güssing District]] where whole tracts of land were under up to a meter of water, while [[Strem]] was surrounded by masses of water.&lt;ref name="SN 2009-06-30-8"/&gt;  The Armed Forces assisted the fire departments with 200 men.  In the Lower Austrian Klingfurth near [[Wiener Neustadt]], homes threatened by a landslide had to be evacuated.  The [[Adria-Wien Pipeline]], which lies in the affected hillside, had to be turned off for security reasons.  In Styria, in which about 400 landslides were recorded since the beginning of the storm, the situation calmed a bit as the day turned to evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oesterreich.orf.at/stories/371300/|title=Hochwasser: Keine Pause für die Helfer - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Oesterreich.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday June 27, two dams of the [[Leitha]] river in [[Bruck an der Leitha District]] were broken open so that water could flow into an uninhabited area in order to relieve the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noe.orf.at/stories/371554/|title=Donauzubringer könnten wieder ansteigen - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Noe.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On Sunday night, a fatality was reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noe.orf.at/stories/371448/|title=Wasserflut fordert Opfer: 16-Jähriger stirbt - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Noe.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further installments of rain were encountered after the weekend.  The assistance of the Armed Forces concentrated on the areas around [[Feldbach District]] and [[Fürstenfeld District]].  [[Upper Styria]] was also increasingly affected.  The village of [[Radmer]] was without power and completely inaccessible after heavy mudslides.  Floods and obstructions also surrounded [[Mariazell]] and [[Hieflau]].  The situation at the [[Enns (river)|Enns]] intensified again.  On the afternoon of Monday June 29, the level of the Steyr was again over 4m.  Wachau also went into another flood warning.&lt;ref name="SN 2009-06-30-8"/&gt;   On the night of June 30, the Alpine railway station was flooded for the second time in the span of a few days&lt;ref name=StPoeltenKatastrophe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.st-poelten.gv.at/Content.Node/presse/Hochwasser.php.23264.php|title=Home - Landeshauptstadt St. Pölten, Niederösterreich|publisher=St-poelten.gv.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the strongest-ever measured rainfall in [[St. Pölten]].  The [[ÖBB]] again closed down the operation of the [[Mariazellerbahn]].&lt;ref name=orfnoe371845&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noe.orf.at/stories/371845/|title=St. Pölten und Wilhelmsburg wieder betroffen - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Noe.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Tuesday, further landslides were able to be stopped with the help of [[Czech hedgehog]]s.  Nevertheless, numerous buildings could still not be cleared as habitable.  Due to scattered storms in [[Graz-Umgebung District]], there were also frequent lightning strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steiermark.orf.at/stories/372319/|title=Heftige Gewitter: Wieder Hangrutschungen - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Steiermark.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday July 3, Wachau was affected by the storm for the second time within two weeks.  [[Spitz, Austria|Spitz]], which had been previously flooded by the Danube, was flooded this time by the usually only 30&amp;nbsp;cm deep Spitzerbach, which swelled to 4m after thunderstorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noe.orf.at/stories/372769/|title=Erneut lokale Überflutungen und Vermurungen - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Noe.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An 81-year-old man who was swept away was not found until July 12 in the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noe.orf.at/stories/374579/|title=Hochwasseropfer vermutlich gefunden - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Oesterreich.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, in [[Waldviertel]] and [[Steyr-Land District]], severe thunderstorms occurred with heavy precipitation, which again required the use of over 2,000 firefighters.&lt;ref name="orf 372868"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oesterreich.orf.at/stories/372868/|title=Ein Toter in Niederösterreich befürchtet - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Oesterreich.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday July 6, the strongest rainfall in 200 years began in the afternoon hours.  Parts of Lower Austria, [[Vienna]], and Northern Burgenland were especially affected.&lt;ref name=derstandard070709&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/fs/1246541405761/Jahrhunderregen-am-Montag-St-Poelten-saeuft-ab|title=St. Pölten säuft ab|work=Derstandard.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Pölten was again declared a disaster area, as large parts of the metropolitan area were flooded.&lt;ref name=stpoelten&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.st-poelten.gv.at/Content.Node/presse/Krisenstab.php|title=Home - Landeshauptstadt St. Pölten, Niederösterreich|publisher=St-poelten.gv.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nadelbach flooded the cadastral communities Nadelbach and Hafing.  The surroundings of the Alpine Railway Station were yet again under water.  Areas that had never before had to suffer through flooding were also unexpectedly under water on July 6. Europaplatz and Schießstadtring in St. Pölten had to be closed off; a 7m-wide stream had carved itself out leading from the Alpine Railway Station to the center of the city.  The regional court and the prison were also threatened by high water.&lt;ref name=presse070709&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/oesterreich/493293/index.do?_vl_backlink=/home/panorama/oesterreich/index.do|title=St. Pölten: Ärger als die Jahrhundertflut|work=DiePresse.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further danger existed at the [[EVN Group]] substation as the water level had almost brought power production to a halt.  The B1a tunnel under the government Landhaus district was blocked due to the flood.  The [[Western Railway (Austria)|Western Railway]] had to be closed down for two hours in the evening.&lt;ref name=derstandard070709/&gt; Additional problems arose due to the rise of the groundwater level associated with the flooding, which also reached a historical peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noe.orf.at/stories/373507/|title=Grundwasserspiegel in St. Pölten enorm hoch - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Noe.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Severe weather warnings were issued on Thursday July 7 that were similar in scope to the days before.  This time however, the storm affected the Upper Austrian area more, where especially extensive damage had been done by hail in agricultural areas in [[Gmunden]], [[Vöcklabruck]], and [[Wels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ooe.orf.at/stories/373644/|title=Millionenschaden nach Hagelunwetter - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Ooe.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dürnstein]] in Wachau, there were rockslides at Vogelbergsteig, which blocked both the Danube Highway and the Danube Railway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oe1.orf.at/inforadio/109114.html?filter=3] {{dead link|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The B3 became once again freely passable on July 10 after explosions that removed loose rock from the wall.  However, the Danube Railway required longer repair work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noe.orf.at/stories/374290/|title=B3 nach Felssturz wieder befahrbar - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Noe.org.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 10, the situation in Styria again took a turn for the worse.  There was further rainfall, especially in Feldbach District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steiermark.orf.at/stories/374178/|title=Erneut Hangrutschungen im Bezirk Feldbach - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Steiermark.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were about 600 landslides in Styria around this timeframe.

====Damage and relief efforts====

Damage estimates were first released after two weeks.  The damage in Burgenland amounted to over €2,500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burgenland.orf.at/stories/373166/|title=Schadensbilanz nach Hochwasser - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Burgenland.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lower Austria, about 3,000 claims were registered with a total claim amount of about €60,000,000.  Because of this, the assistance for Lower Austria was increased from an estimated €2,500,000 to €10,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noe.orf.at/stories/373442/|title=Hochwasserhilfe des Landes wird aufgestockt - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Oesterreich.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Upper Austria, damage claims were expected to be about €20,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oesterreich.orf.at/stories/374233/|title=Nach dem Hochwasser: Schaden wird sichtbar - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Oesterreich.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Styria, the amount was about €10,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steiermark.orf.at/stories/373945/|title=Bezirk Feldbach: Noch keine Entwarnung - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Steiermark.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The other federal states did not report damage totals.

Since disaster management in Austria takes place mainly at the federal state level, figures for all of Austria are not readily available.  Countrywide figures were only released for the Armed Forces.  137,000 relief hours were worked in the assistance operation from June 23 to July 9.  On average, about 700 soldiers were deployed at any time countrywide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oesterreich.orf.at/stories/373943/|title=Soldaten waren 137.000 Stunden im Einsatz - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Oesterreich.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 311,000 relief hours were worked by firefighters and disaster assistance services in the largest federal state Lower Austria alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noe.orf.at/stories/374312/|title=Tausende Helfer packten an - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Noe.orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Austrian Red Cross]] also helped with many volunteers and crisis intervention teams.  Likewise, Team Austria volunteers were put to work in the relief effort.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120712022100/http://oe3.orf.at/teamoesterreich/stories/372677/] &lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that at the beginning of August in Lower Austria alone twelve streets and three railways were obstructed shows how extensive the infrastructure damage was.  The repair work took weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noe.orf.at/stories/379495/|title=Nach Unwettern weiterhin Straßen gesperrt - oesterreich.ORF.at|publisher=Noe.org.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Czech Republic ===

In the Czech Republic, persistent heavy rainfall beginning on June 22 led to the rise of smaller Vltavan tributaries in the [[Bohemian Forest]] and the Nové Hrady Mountains.  A flood warning was issued for the [[South Bohemian Region]].  The highest level was reached in the rivers [[Malše]], Blatnice, and Černá.  [[České Budějovice]] was also affected by the warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tschechien-online.org/news/15385-hochwasserwarnung-tschechien/|title=Hochwasserwarnung in Tschechien|work=Tschechien Online|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the evening, the Rožnovská Bečva rose about 1.2m in [[Valašské Meziříčí]] and its water level at the estuary in the [[Bečva]] rose to ten times normal.  The [[Vsetínská Bečva]] also swelled and several streets were flooded in [[Vsetín]], Valašské Meziříčí, and [[Rožnov pod Radhoštěm]].  In [[Zubří (Vsetín District)|Zubří]], numerous cars were overcome by the water.  There were fatalities in [[Černotín]] and Valašské Meziříčí.  In [[Český Krumlov]], the [[Vltava]] reached six times the normal water amount, with 63 m³/s.  Near [[Větřní]], a dinghy containing three occupants capsized, one of which drowned.

[[File:Nový Jičín, den po povodni 2009.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Flash flood in [[Nový Jičín]] on June 25, 2009, the morning after]]

The floods in North [[Moravia]] and [[Silesia]] took on a different character.  In the span of two hours on June 24, strong rainfall brought flash floods with up to 80L/m² of rain at the streams Jičínka and Zrzávka.  The level of the Jičínka swelled to 5.5m and thereby exceeded the [[1997 Central European flood]] by 2m.  In [[Jeseník nad Odrou]], the brook Luha rose to 2m in the span of a half-hour; four people died in that community, three by drowning.  People also died in [[Nový Jičín]], [[Bernartice nad Odrou]], [[Životice u Nového Jičína]], and [[Kunín]].  The floods also created extensive damage in districts of Nový Jičín such as Bludovice, Žilina, [[Hodslavice]], and [[Mořkov]].

Other rivers temporarily rose over their banks after strong local rainfall.  In [[Bohemian Switzerland]], the [[Kamenice (Labe)|Kamenice]] flooded parts of [[Janská]] on the evening of July 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obec-janska.cz/index.php?page%3Dpovoden |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905004138/http://www.obec-janska.cz/index.php?page=povoden |archivedate=2009-09-05 |df= }} Bilder von Hochwasser in Janská&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 6th, sudden thunderstorms hit [[Ústí nad Labem Region]], where a state of emergency had to be called in some places.  West and South Bohemia were also severely threatened in places like [[Tábor]].  The authorities feared a burst of dams of artificial lakes and considered evacuating the affected villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tschechien-online.org/news/15467-howasser-serie-tschechien-reisst-nicht/|title=Hochwasser-Serie in Tschechien reit nicht ab|work=Tschechien Online|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts of West and South Bohemia as well as Central Moravia were also greatly affected by the flood.  In the region, dams of a series of artificially created lakes threatened to break.  The authorities considered the evacuation of more villages on Tuesday night.

Overall, fourteen people died in the Czech Republic due to the impact of the flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rosie|last=Johnston|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/more-flash-floods-strike-north-bohemia|title=More flash floods strike north Bohemia|work=Radio Prague|date=5 July 2009|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Olomouc Region]] and the [[Moravian-Silesian Region]] were particularly affected in the drainage basins of the [[Oder]] and the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] where numerous streets and rail lines were disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tschechien-online.org/news/15400-hochwasser-tschechien-fordert-zwolf-todesopfer/|title=Hochwasser in Tschechien fordert 12 Todesopfer|work=Tschechien Online|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first estimates, the total damage was estimated to be 5-6 billion [[Czech koruna]] (about €230,000,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-regions-to-coordinate-steps-after-floods/386578?id=386573|title=Hašek: Kraje budou koordinovat obnovu po záplavách|language=Czech|work=Czech News Agency|date=5 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712022540/http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-regions-to-coordinate-steps-after-floods/386578?id=386573|archivedate=12 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hepatitis vaccinations were commenced for children in severely affected areas in order to prevent an outbreak of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniela|last=Lazarová|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/children-in-flood-regions-inoculated-against-hepatitis|title=Children in flood regions inoculated against hepatitis|work=Radio Prague|date=6 July 2009|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, the lowest flood warning level was lifted in Nový Jičín Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/de/artikel/118638|title=Radio Prag - Trotz Hochwasserschäden kehrt normales Leben in Region Nový Jičín zurück|publisher=Radio.cz|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of the speed of response by firefighters and municipalities was prevalent, as citizens were not informed about impending floods.  The Environmental Minister [[Ladislav Miko]] confirmed that the meteorological internet server broke down at a critical time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jan|last=Velinger|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/hospodarske-noviny-flood-commission-recommends-30-million-be-used-to-improve-communication-between-authorities-during-flood-crises|title=Hospodářské noviny: flood commission recommends 30 million be used to improve communication between authorities during flood crises|work=Radio Prague|date=24 July 2009|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
By June 23, the first warnings in [[Bavaria]] had already come as precipitation amounted to 70L/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 24 hours.  In the mountains, snowfall was observed.  On the Zugspitze, 60&amp;nbsp;cm of new snow fell.  The first floods came at the [[Inn (river)|Inn]]. [[Altötting (district)|Altötting]], [[Berchtesgadener Land]], [[Cham (district)|Cham]], and particularly [[Traunstein (district)|Traunstein]] were affected by the flooding owing to rising tributaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/577/473095/text/|title=Hochwasser in Bayern befürchtet - Wasser ohne Ende|work=Süddeutsche.de|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday night, June 25, the level of the Danube rose in [[Passau]], such that the warning level reached 3 (definition: individual built-up properties or basements are flooded, blocking of local transport channels, or isolated use of water or dam defense is required).  On Thursday, the flooding of the Danube and the [[Isar]] moved the warning level to 2 (definition: agriculture and forestry land is flooded or light traffic delays on main traffic roads and local roads).  Throughout Thursday, the water level sank in Passau, however the recession was slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.news.yahoo.com/1/20090625/twl-hochwasser-in-bayern-auf-rckzug-1be00ca.html |title=Yahoo Nachrichten - Aktuelle Nachrichten &amp; Meldungen |work=Yahoo Nachrichten Deutschland |accessdate=28 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628145320/http://de.news.yahoo.com/1/20090625/twl-hochwasser-in-bayern-auf-rckzug-1be00ca.html |archivedate=28 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hungary ===
[[File:Esztergom 2009 flood 2.JPG|200px|thumb|right|[[Nándor Zsolt Music School]] surrounded by water in [[Esztergom]]]]
The first flood notifications in Hungary came on June 25.  The [[Rába]] reached the highest ever measured level in [[Szentgotthárd]] on Thursday morning.  This was about 30&amp;nbsp;cm higher than in a large flood in 1965.  Due to the temporary expansion of flood protection and because the high water level did not persist, there was no expected risk.  The Hungarian Western Railway still had to close down operation between Szentgotthárd and [[Jennersdorf]] because the rails were undermined in numerous places.  In [[Komárom-Esztergom County]], the first flood warning level was called.  The [[Leitha]] in Hungarian territory was not affected.

On June 26, a cautious all-clear was announced for the Danube between [[Esztergom]] and [[Budapest]] because the water levels remained lower than had been feared.  The peak was expected on the night of June 27 into the 28th and was estimated to be 40–50&amp;nbsp;cm deeper than in the devastating floods of 2006.  Nevertheless, precautions were taken in numerous important locations, such as [[Szentendre Island]].

On the morning of Sunday, June 28, the Danube reached its high point which was 25% less than the floods in 2006.  Flood warnings were in effect for a stretch of 528 kilometers of the Danube in Hungary.  In [[Nagymaros]], the level rose 5.33m, while the level in Budapest rose 6.96m.  The increase had been expected to be 7.04m for a short time.  In the upper Danube areas, the level sank noticeably around this time.  In Budapest alone, the floods led to the blockage of the two quays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pesterlloyd.net/2009_26/0926hochmontag/0926hochmontag.html|title=Hochwasser in Ungarn 2009, Donau, Budapest - Pester Lloyd|publisher=Pesterlloyd.net|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2 there were alerts along 853 kilometers. 36 kilometers of third degree alerts near the river [[Lajta]], second degree on the Danube at [[Dunakiliti]], [[Győr]], [[Komárom]], [[Esztergom]], [[Budapest]] and on the river Rába at [[Sárvár]], first degree alerts from the Ipoly river mouth to the southern border of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=853 kilométernyi szakaszon van árvízvédelmi készültség  - hir3.hu - Megbízható hírforrás, értéket közvetít |url=http://hir3.hu/index.php?hir=magazin&amp;hirid=25973&amp;kat=1 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iXakWyex?url=http://hir3.hu/index.php?hir=magazin&amp;hirid=25973&amp;kat=1 |archivedate=2009-07-25 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===

On June 23, smaller rivers rose in the area of [[Rzeszów]] and in [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]].  After strong rain fell in the [[Owl Mountains]] (at the rate of 60mm/h in [[Walim, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Walim]], for example), flood warnings were called for the Piława at Mościsko (Faulbrück) and the Bystrzyca Świdnicka at Lubachów (Breitenhain).  In Świdnica, Bystrzyca Street flooded.  Further damage was seen in [[Wałbrzych]] and [[Jelenia Góra]].

The Polish National Security Center stated that rivers exceeded warning levels in forty-three areas, whilst alarm levels were exceeded in a further twenty places.&lt;ref name="At least 10 die in Czech floods"/&gt; A total of fifty families were evacuated in [[Kraków]]. Water submerged a railway station in [[Upper Silesia]].

=== Romania ===
Flood warnings were issued for 22 and 23 June for 21 [[Counties of Romania|counties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.jurnalul.ro/stire-meteo/avertizarea-hidrologica-de-inundatii-pentru-21-de-judete-se-mentine-pana-miercuri-la-pranz-512355.html "Avertizarea hidrologică de inundaţii pentru 21 de judeţe se menţine până miercuri la prânz" ("Flood Warning for 21 Counties Maintained until Wednesday at Noon")], ''Jurnalul Naţional'', 23 June 2009; accessed 30 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst rain and hail, warnings were also issued for the [[Buzău River|Buzău]] and [[Ialomiţa River|Ialomiţa]] rivers for 29 and 30 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.jurnalul.ro/stire-meteo/avertizarea-hidrologica-de-inundatii-pentru-21-de-judete-se-mentine-pana-miercuri-la-pranz-512355.html "Cod galben de inundaţii pe râurile Buzău şi Ialomiţa.

===Serbia===
Serbia was also hit with heavy rainfall by the storms.  Places like [[Belgrade]] and [[Novi Sad]] in the north of the country were mainly affected, but [[Valjevo]] was also affected 90&amp;nbsp;km southeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2009&amp;mm=06&amp;dd=30&amp;nav_id=60184 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801124815/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2009&amp;mm=06&amp;dd=30&amp;nav_id=60184 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 August 2012 |title=B92 - News - Storms hit northern Serbia |work=B92 |accessdate=28 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
A flash flood in [[Istanbul]] started on September 9. Heavy rains caused water levels to rise six feet, flooding a major highway and commercial district in the city's Ikitelli district. Hundreds of people climbed onto rooftops, and many desperate motorists struggled to escape their vehicles and run to safety. Others drowned in their own vehicles. Many people taking refuge on rooftop of them were airlifted to safety by rescue helicopters. Rescue workers using inflatable boats also travelled through the flooded streets, picking up survivors. Some rescuers used ropes to drag people across the torrent to safety. Four helicopters and eight boats were used for rescue work. Istanbul firefighters recovered seven bodies at a truck parking lot littered with upended trucks. The bodies of seven women were found in a van outside a textile factory. The van had been taking them to their jobs, when the flood hit. Police were deployed throughout the city to prevent looting. Two other people died in Istanbul's Catalca suburb and six others were swept away by the flood. 20 people died, 8 were listed as missing, and 20 were injured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.yahoo.comk/s/ap/20090909/ap_on_re_eu/eu_turkey_floods] {{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further storms==
Storms followed this series of floods that had no connection with the weather referenced above but mostly affected the same areas.

On the night of July 23, a storm front moved from Germany into Austria, the Czech Republic, and Poland that arose due to previously prevalent unusually high temperatures.  It impacted the area through hail and storms and partially also through heavy rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fireworld.at/cms/story.php?id=23043|title=Sbg: Groeinsatz nach Hagelsturm im Flachgau|publisher=Fireworld.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lower Austria, where such fronts usually dissipate, the front strengthened and the storms hit the Vienna metropolitan area.  The population was completely unprepared when the storm struck because it did not appear in any weather models.  People were injured or even killed mainly by uprooted trees.  Agriculture was also hit hard with damages.  Widespread power outages were recorded.  The Austrian insurance companies faced damages of around €20,000,000 in the agricultural industry alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orf.at/090724-40808/?href=http://www.orf.at/090724-40808/40809txt_story.html|title=Tennisballgro&amp;zlig;e Hagelkörner|publisher=Orf.at|accessdate=28 November 2014}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian hail insurance companies also faced the largest single event in the last 60 years from a cost of damages perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagel.at/site/index.cfm?objectid=AC305148-AE47-DA47-1924EF91D0838ED2&amp;refid=2C81258A-3005-4277-CFC40E405708392F|title=Hagelversicherung: Unwetter vom 23.

A '''brine spring''' or '''salt spring''' is a [[Brine|saltwater]] [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]].

Brine springs are not necessarily associated with [[halite]] deposits in the immediate vicinity. They may occur at valley bottoms made of clay and gravel which became soggy with brine seeped downslope from the valley sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= W.C. |last= Phalen |year= 1919 |title= Salt Resources of the United States |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jagPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA132 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= Government Printing Office |page= 132 |oclc= 4101987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, brine springs have been early sources of U.S. salt production, as in the case of the [[salterns]] in [[Salt industry in Syracuse, New York|Syracuse, New York]] and at the [[Illinois Salines]].

A '''bromide''' is a chemical compound containing a bromide [[ion]] or [[ligand]]. This is a [[bromine]] atom with an ionic [[electric charge|charge]] of −1 (Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;); for example, in [[caesium bromide]], caesium cations (Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are electrically attracted to bromide anions (Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to form the electrically neutral [[ionic compound]] CsBr. The term "bromide" can also refer to a bromine atom with an [[oxidation number]] of −1 in [[covalent]] compounds such as [[sulfur dibromide]] (SBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Natural occurrence==
Bromide is present in typical [[seawater]] (35 [[Salinity|PSU]]) with a concentration of around 65&amp;nbsp;mg/L, which is around 0.2% of all dissolved [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s. Seafoods and deep sea plants generally have high levels of bromide, while foods derived from land have variable amounts. Bromargyryte - natural, crystalline silver bromide - is the most common bromide mineral currently known. It is still very rare. Beside silver, bromine is sometimes found in minerals combined with mercury and copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindat.org|title=Mindat.org - Mines, Minerals and More|author=|date=|website=www.mindat.org|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010302042623/http://www.mindat.org/|archivedate=2 March 2001|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
One can test for a bromide ion by adding excess dilute [[nitric acid|HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] followed by dilute aqueous [[silver nitrate|AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] solution. The formation of creamy [[silver bromide]] precipitate confirms the existence of bromides.

==Medical uses==
{{Main|Potassium bromide}}

Bromide compounds, especially [[potassium bromide]], were frequently used as sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Their use in over-the-counter sedatives and headache remedies (such as [[Bromo-Seltzer]]) in the United States extended to 1975, when bromides were withdrawn as ingredients, due to [[chronic toxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url =https://books.google.com/?id=fd_S2Van52EC&amp;dq=%22The+Great+American+Fraud%22&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title = The Great American fraud | author1 =Adams | first1 =Samuel Hopkins | year =1905 | postscript =&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This use gave the word "bromide" its colloquial connotation of a boring [[cliché]], a bit of [[conventional wisdom]] overused as a calming phrase, or verbal [[sedative]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|title=the definition of bromide|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bromide|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=21 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224192445/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bromide|archivedate=24 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bromide ion is [[antiepileptic]], and bromide salts are still used as such, particularly in veterinary medicine. Bromide ion is excreted by the kidneys. The half-life of bromide in the human body (12 days) is long compared with many pharmaceuticals, making dosing difficult to adjust (a new dose may require several months to reach equilibrium). Bromide ion concentrations in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] are about 30% of those in blood, and are strongly influenced by the body's chloride intake and metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, L. S. and Gilman, A. (eds.) (1970) "Hypnotics and Sedatives", p. 121 in Chapter 10 in ''The Biological Basis of Therapeutics'', Fourth Edition, The MacMillan Co., London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since bromide is still used in veterinary medicine (particularly to treat seizures in dogs) in the United States, veterinary diagnostic labs can routinely measure blood bromide levels. However, this is not a conventional test in human medicine in the U.S., since there are no FDA-approved uses for bromide, and (as noted) it is no longer available in over-the-counter sedatives. Therapeutic bromide levels are measured in European countries like [[Germany]], where bromide is still used therapeutically in human epilepsy.

Chronic toxicity from bromide can result in [[bromism]], a syndrome with multiple neurological symptoms. Bromide toxicity can also cause a type of skin eruption. See [[potassium bromide]].

[[Lithium bromide]] was used as a [[sedative]] beginning in the early 1900s, but it fell into disfavor in the 1940s, possibly due to the rising popularity of safer and more efficient sedatives (specifically, [[barbiturates]]) and when some heart patients died after using a salt substitute (see [[lithium chloride]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/content/Article/87/99356.htm?pagenumber=1 Bipolar disorder]. webmd.com&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[lithium carbonate]] and [[lithium chloride]] it was used as treatment for [[bipolar disorder]].

It has been said that during World War I, British soldiers were given bromide to curb their sexual urges,&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, Yuki (2002) ''Japan's Comfort Women: Sexual slavery and prostitution during World War II and the US Occupation'', Routledge, p. 175. {{ISBN|0415194008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although this is not well supported by documentation, and has been disputed as an urban myth, as the sedative effects of bromide would have hampered military performance. [[Lord Dunsany]] mentions a soldier being given bromide as a sedative for nervous exhaustion and overwork in his play ''Fame and the Poet'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lord Dunsany|title=Fame and the Poet|journal=The Atlantic Monthly|date=August 1919|pages=175–183|url=https://www.unz.org/Pub/AtlanticMonthly-1919aug-00175|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222133207/https://www.unz.org/Pub/AtlanticMonthly-1919aug-00175|archivedate=2015-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are more substantiated reports that bromide was used in the food served at some concentration camps during the Holocaust. This was apparently done in an effort to both chemically restrain the interned and prevent menstruation in women.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, “The Coming of Age” in Women and the Holocaust, eds Rittter &amp; Roth, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In biology==
According to one study, bromine (as bromide) is an essential cofactor in the peroxidasin catalysis of sulfilimine crosslinks in collagen IV. This post-translational modification occurs in all animals, and bromine is an essential trace element for humans.&lt;ref name="pmid24906154"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=McCall AS, Cummings CF, Bhave G, Vanacore R, Page-McCaw A, Hudson BG |title = Bromine Is an Essential Trace Element for Assembly of Collagen IV Scaffolds in Tissue Development and Architecture|journal = Cell|volume = 157|issue = 6|pages = 1380–92|year = 2014|pmid = 24906154|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.009|pmc=4144415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromide is needed by [[eosinophils]] (white blood cells of the granulocyte class, specialized for dealing with multi-cellular parasites), which use it to generate antiparasitic brominating compounds such as [[hypobromite]], by the action of [[eosinophil peroxidase]], a [[haloperoxidase]] enzyme which is able to use chloride, but preferentially uses bromide when available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2538427 |year=1989 |last1=Mayeno |first1=AN |last2=Curran |first2=AJ |last3=Roberts|first3=RL|last4=Foote|first4=CS|title=Eosinophils preferentially use bromide to generate halogenating agents|volume=264|issue=10|pages=5660–8|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than its role in collagen IV production and its facultative use in eosinophils by the body, bromide is not known in other cases necessary for animal life, as its functions may generally be replaced (though in some cases not as well) by chloride. Land plants do not use bromide.

Bromide salts are also sometimes used in [[hot tub]]s and spas as mild [[germicidal]] agents, using the action of an added oxidizing agent to generate ''in situ'' [[hypobromite]], in a similar fashion to the peroxidase in eosinophils.

Bromide is perhaps a minor necessary nutrient for [[collagen]] IV-producing animals in the sea. However, a few sea animals, such as ''[[Murex]]'' snails, use bromide to make organic compounds. Bromide ion is also heavily concentrated by some species of ocean [[algae]], which construct [[methyl bromide]] and a great number of bromoorganic compounds with it, using the unusual enzymes called [[vanadium bromoperoxidase]]s to do these reactions.

The average concentration of bromide in human blood in Queensland, Australia is {{val|5.3|1.4|u=mg/L}} and varies with age and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9602940|year=1998|last1=Olszowy|first1=HA|last2=Rossiter|first2=J|last3=Hegarty|first3=J|last4=Geoghegan|first4=P|title=Background levels of bromide in human blood|volume=22|issue=3|pages=225–30|journal=Journal of Analytical Toxicology|doi=10.1093/jat/22.3.225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much higher levels may indicate exposure to brominated chemicals (e.g. [[methyl bromide]]). However, since bromide occurs in relatively high concentration in seawater and many types of seafood, bromide concentrations in the blood are heavily influenced by seafood contributions to the diet.

'''Chalk River Laboratories''' ({{lang-fr|Laboratoires de Chalk River}}; also known as '''CRL''', '''Chalk River Labs''' and formerly '''Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories''') is a Canadian [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] research facility in [[Deep River, Ontario|Deep River]], [[Renfrew County]], [[Ontario]], near [[Chalk River]], about {{cvt|180|km}} north-west of [[Ottawa]].

CRL is a site of major research and development to support and advance nuclear technology, in particular [[CANDU reactor]] technology. CRL has expertise in physics, metallurgy, chemistry, biology, and engineering and unique research facilities. For example, [[Bertram Brockhouse]], a professor at [[McMaster University]], received the 1994 [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics for his pioneering work in [[neutron spectroscopy]] while at CRL from 1950-1962.  Sir [[John Cockcroft]] was an early director of CRL and also a [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]]. CRL produces a large share of the world's supply of [[Nuclear medicine|medical radioisotopes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chalk River makes 1st isotopes in 15 months|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2010/08/18/isotopes-medical-chalk-river-aecl.html|publisher=CBC.ca|accessdate=15 March 2011|date=August 18, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606061302/http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2010/08/18/isotopes-medical-chalk-river-aecl.html|archivedate=6 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is owned by the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories subsidiary of [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] and operated under contract by the Canadian National Energy Alliance, a private-sector consortium led by [[SNC-Lavalin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marowits|first1=Ross|title=SNC-Lavalin consortium chosen to run Chalk River nuclear lab|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/snc-lavalin-consortium-chosen-to-run-chalk-river-nuclear-lab|accessdate=February 9, 2017|work=Ottawa Citizen|date=June 26, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415135343/http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/snc-lavalin-consortium-chosen-to-run-chalk-river-nuclear-lab|archivedate=April 15, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:NRX_Pile_Building_and_ZEEP_Building-_Cooling_Tanks_1945.jpg|thumb|right|NRX and Zeep buildings, Chalk River Laboratories, 1945]] The facility arose out of a 1942 collaboration between British and Canadian nuclear researchers which saw a [[Montreal Laboratory|Montreal research laboratory]] established under the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] (NRC).  By 1944 the Chalk River Laboratories were opened and in September, 1945 the facility saw the first nuclear reactor outside of the United States become operational (see [[Lew Kowarski]]).  In 1946, NRC closed the Montreal laboratory and focused its resources on Chalk River.

In 1952, [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] (AECL) was created by the government to promote peaceful use of nuclear energy.  AECL also took over operation of Chalk River from the NRC.  Throughout the 1950s-2000s various nuclear research reactors have been operated by AECL for production of nuclear material for medical and scientific applications.  The Laboratories produce about one-third of the world's [[Nuclear medicine|medical isotopes]], and about half of the North American supply. Despite the declaration of peaceful use, from 1955 to 1976, Chalk River facilities supplied about 250&amp;nbsp;kg of [[plutonium]], in the form of spent reactor fuel, to the U.S. Department of Energy to be used in the production of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;letter from Dept. of Energy official, March 4, 1996, published at {{cite web |url=http://www.ccnr.org/DOE.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628205542/http://www.ccnr.org/DOE.html |archivedate=2008-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The bomb dropped on [[Nagasaki]], Japan, used about 6.4&amp;nbsp;kg of plutonium.)

Canada's first [[nuclear power plant]], a partnership between AECL and [[Ontario Hydro|Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario]], went online in 1962 near the site of Chalk River Laboratories. This reactor, [[Nuclear Power Demonstration]] (NPD), was a demonstration of the [[CANDU reactor]] design, one of the world's safest and most successful nuclear reactors.

The Deep River [[neutron monitor]] operated once in Chalk river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cr0.izmiran.ru/dprv/baseinfo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129081714/http://cr0.izmiran.ru/dprv/baseinfo.htm |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1952 NRX incident===
Chalk River was also the site of two nuclear accidents in the 1950s. The first incident occurred in 1952, when there was a [[Criticality accident|power excursion]] and partial loss of coolant in the [[NRX]] reactor, which resulted in significant damage to the core. The control rods could not be lowered into the core because of mechanical problems and human errors. Three rods did not reach their destination and were taken out again by accident. The fuel rods were overheated, resulting in a meltdown. The reactor and the reactor building were seriously damaged by hydrogen explosions. The seal of the reactor vessel was blown up four feet. In the cellar of the building, some 4,500 tons of radioactive water was found. This water was dumped in ditches around 1600 meters from the border of the [[Ottawa River]]. During this accident some 10,000 [[curies]] or 370 TBq of radioactive material was released.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Nuclear Society'' (1989) [http://media.cns-snc.ca/history/nrx.html The NRX Incident by Peter Jedicke]&lt;/ref&gt; Future [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Jimmy Carter]], then a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] officer, was part of the cleanup crew.&lt;ref name="paulson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccnr.org/paulson_legacy.html|title=Reactor Accidents: The Human Fallout|author=|date=|website=www.ccnr.org|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923232909/http://www.ccnr.org/paulson_legacy.html|archivedate=23 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/timeline/index.html|title=Jimmy Carter timeline|author=|date=|website=pbs.org|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329152940/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/timeline/index.html|archivedate=29 March 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later the reactor was in use again.&lt;ref name="CNF1952"&gt;{{en icon}} ''The Canadian Nuclear FAQ'' [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRX reactor in 1952?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022641/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm |date=2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1958 NRU incident===
The second accident, in 1958, involved a fuel rupture and fire in the [[National Research Universal reactor]] (NRU) reactor building. Some fuel rods were overheated. With a robotic crane, one of the rods with metallic [[uranium]] was pulled out of the reactor vessel. When the arm of the crane moved away from the vessel, the uranium caught fire and the rod broke. The largest part of the rod fell down into the containment vessel, still burning. The whole building was contaminated. The valves of the ventilation system were opened, and a large area outside the building was contaminated. The fire was extinguished by scientists and maintenance men in protective clothing running along the hole in the containment vessel with buckets of wet sand, throwing the sand down at the moment they passed the smoking entrance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Canadian Nuclear FAQ'' [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#nru1958 What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRU reactor in 1958?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022641/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm |date=2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both accidents required a major cleanup effort involving many civilian and military personnel.  Follow-up health monitoring of these workers has not revealed any adverse impacts from the two accidents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#nru1958 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022641/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm |date=2009-01-30 }} What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRU reactor in 1958?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x|title=The Canadian Nuclear FAQ - Section D: Safety and Liability|author=|date=|website=www.nuclearfaq.ca|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006022038/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x|archivedate=6 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Anti-nuclear movement in Canada#Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility|Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility]], an [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] watchdog group, notes that some cleanup workers who were part of the military contingent assigned to the NRU reactor building unsuccessfully applied for a military disability pension due to health damages.&lt;ref name="paulson"/&gt;

Chalk River Laboratories remain an AECL facility to this day and are used as both a research (in partnership with the NRC) and production facility (on behalf of AECL) in support of other Canadian electrical utilities.

=== 2007 shutdown ===
On November 18, 2007, the NRU, which makes medical radioisotopes, was shut down for routine maintenance. This shutdown was extended when AECL, in consultation with the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]] (CNSC), decided to connect seismically-qualified emergency power supplies (EPS) to two of the reactor's cooling pumps (in addition to the AC and DC backup power systems already in place), which had been required as part of its August 2006 operating licence issued by the CNSC.  This resulted in a worldwide shortage of radioisotopes for medical treatments because Chalk River makes the majority of the world's supply of medical radioisotopes, including two-thirds of the world's [[technetium-99m]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/highlights/2006/0605chalkriver_e.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402220916/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/highlights/2006/0605chalkriver_e.html |date=April 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, 2007, the [[House of Commons of Canada]], acting on independent expert advice, passed emergency legislation authorizing the restarting of the NRU reactor and its operation for 120 days (counter to the decision of the CNSC), which was passed by the Senate and received [[Royal Assent]] on December 12. Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] criticized the CNSC for this shutdown which "jeopardized the health and safety of tens of thousands of Canadians", insisting that there was no risk, contrary to the testimony of then CNSC President &amp; CEO Linda Keen. She would later be fired for ignoring a decision by Parliament to restart the reactor, reflecting its policy that the safety of citizens requiring essential [[nuclear medicine]] should be taken into account in assessing the overall safety concerns of the reactor's operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071211.wisotope1211/BNStory/National/ |accessdate=December 14, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403090931/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071211.wisotope1211/BNStory/National/ |archivedate=April 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |last=Ljunggren |first=David |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1154689120071213 |title=Canadian parliament orders isotope reactor restart |journal=Reuters |date=2007-12-12 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603180453/http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1154689120071213 |archivedate=2009-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sunday, May 5, 2013 3:49 PM EDT Facebook Twitter RSS |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/285210 |title=Much more at stake than medical isotopes &amp;#124; Toronto Star |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002154837/http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/285210 |archivedate=October 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/12/13/chalk-river-reactor.html |title=Chalk River plant to begin making radioisotopes in a week - Canada - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926071822/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/12/13/chalk-river-reactor.html |archivedate=2010-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Citizen |first=Ottawa |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=c70b1f37-7efe-46c1-a165-8b0efd4dfcaa |title=Harper government fires Linda Keen over isotope crisis |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-01-16 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110071829/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=c70b1f37-7efe-46c1-a165-8b0efd4dfcaa |archivedate=2012-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NRU reactor was restarted on December 16, 2007.

===2008 radioactive leakage===
On December 5, 2008, [[heavy water]] containing tritium leaked from the NRU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/issues/memo_re_december_2008.cfm |title=Current Issues - CNSC Report to Minister of Natural Resources regarding recent events at National Research Universal (NRU) Reactor |publisher=Cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222055045/http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/issues/memo_re_december_2008.cfm |archivedate=2013-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The leaked water was contained within the facility, and the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]] (CNSC) was notified immediately, as required.

In its formal report to the CNSC, filed on December 9, 2008 (when the volume of leakage was determined to meet the requirement for such a report) [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited|AECL]] mentioned that 47 litres of heavy water were released from the reactor, about 10% of which evaporated and the rest contained, but affirmed that the spill was not serious and did not present a threat to public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090127/radioactive_spill_090127/20090127?hub=Canada&amp;s_name= |title=Agency says it was told of nuke leak within hours &amp;#124; CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604012750/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090127/radioactive_spill_090127/20090127?hub=Canada&amp;s_name= |archivedate=2009-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount that evaporated to the atmosphere is considered to be minor, accounting for less than a thousandth of the regulatory limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aecl.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=971 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615020303/http://www.aecl.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=971 |archivedate=2009-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The public was informed of the shutdown at the reactor, but not the details of the leakage since it was not deemed to pose a risk to the public or environment.  The leak stopped before the source could be identified, and the reactor was restarted on December 11, 2008 with the approval of the CNSC, after a strategy for dealing with the leak (should it reappear) was put in place.

In an unrelated incident, the same reactor had been leaking 7,001 litres of light water per day from a crack in a weld of the reactor's reflector system.  This water has been systematically collected, purified in an on-site Waste Treatment Centre, and eventually released to the Ottawa River in accordance with CNSC, Health Canada, and Ministry of the Environment regulations.  Although the leakage is not a concern to the CNSC from a health, safety or environmental perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/releases/news_release.cfm?news_release_id=332 |title=News Releases |publisher=Cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229170842/http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/releases/news_release.cfm?news_release_id=332 |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; AECL has plans for a repair to reduce the current leakage rate for operational reasons.

===2009 NRU reactor shutdown===
{{Main|National Research Universal reactor#2009 Shutdown|l1=National Research Universal reactor&amp;nbsp;— 2009 Shutdown}}
In mid-May 2009 the heavy water leak at the base of the NRU reactor vessel, first detected in 2008 (see above), returned at a greater rate and prompted another temporary shutdown that lasted until August 2010.  The lengthy shutdown was necessary to first completely defuel the entire reactor, then ascertain the full extent of the corrosion to the vessel, and finally to effect the repairs&amp;nbsp;— all with remote and restricted access from a minimum distance of 8 metres due to the residual radioactive fields in the reactor vessel. The 2009 shutdown occurred at a time when only one of the other four worldwide regular medical isotope sourcing reactors was producing, resulting in a worldwide shortage. {{citation-needed|date=December 2016}}

==NRU shutdown in March 2018==
The NRU reactor licence expired in 2016, however the licence was extended to March 31 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/a-relic-of-canada-s-atom-age-the-nru-reactor-is-shutting-down-for-good-1.4595836|title=Canada's NRU reactor in Chalk River is being turned off for good  - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409162437/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/a-relic-of-canada-s-atom-age-the-nru-reactor-is-shutting-down-for-good-1.4595836|archivedate=9 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;2018.

'''Chicago and Southern Air Lines Flight 4''' was a regularly scheduled flight from [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] to [[Chicago, Illinois]], via [[Jackson, Mississippi]], [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[St. Louis, Missouri]], operated with a [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra]].   On August 5, 1936, after departing from  [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]], the flight crashed in a farm field near the Missouri River. All 6 passengers and 2 crew members were killed in the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=25677 |title=ASN Aircraft accident 05-AUG-1936 Lockheed 10B Electra NC16022 |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==

The Lockheed Electra was on a flight from [[New Orleans]] to [[Chicago]].  After having left New Orleans at 5:30 PM, it proceeded normally to [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and [[St. Louis]].   It departed St. Louis at 10PM, and was scheduled to arrive in Chicago at 12:55 AM.&lt;ref name="gendisasters0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.gendisasters.com/missouri/15418/st-louis-mo-near-transport-plane-crash-aug-1936?page=0%2C0 |title=St. Louis, MO (near) Transport Plane Crash, Aug 1936 &amp;#124; GenDisasters ... Genealogy in Tragedy, Disasters, Fires, Floods |publisher=.gendisasters.com |date=2010-03-08 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft departed St. Louis and proceeded on a northerly track towards the [[Missouri River]].  Five minutes after departure, all radio contact was lost with the aircraft.   Chicago and Southern’s company radio controller made repeated attempts to contact the flight, and then notified the Chicago station, informing them of the missing aircraft.&lt;ref name="gendisasters0"/&gt;

Farmers in the vicinity of the aircraft’s last radio contact were contacted, and began a search for the aircraft, believing an accident had occurred.   Within several hours the aircraft was located, in a farm field near the Missouri River.   Seven of the plane’s eight occupants were found within 50 feet of the wreckage; the remaining passenger was found still in the cabin.  All of the victims showed signs of massive impact trauma, and were believed to have been killed instantly.&lt;ref name="gendisasters0"/&gt;

The weather in the area had been reported as clear, except for in the vicinity of the river, where heavy ground fog was present.   Preliminary reports believed the ground fog to have been a factor.&lt;ref name="gendisasters0"/&gt;

Upon examination of the wreckage, it was found that the plane had, for unknown reasons, been in a low turn near the ground, and the wingtip made contact with the terrain, causing the aircraft to impact the ground.   The reason for the low-altitude turn was unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planecrashinfo.com/1936/1936-23.htm |title=Accident Details : August 5, 1936 |publisher=Planecrashinfo.com |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9252">'''Cryoneurolysis''', also referred to as '''cryoanalgesia''', is a medical procedure that temporarily blocks nerve conduction along peripheral nerve pathways. The procedure, which inserts a small probe to freeze the target nerve, can facilitate complete regeneration of the structure and function of the affected nerve. Cryoneurolysis has been used to treat a variety of painful conditions.

==Medical uses==
A similar procedure that uses [[radiofrequency]] energy for [[back pain]] appears to have short term benefit, but it is unclear if it has a long term effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boswell|first1=MV|last2=Colson|first2=JD|last3=Sehgal|first3=N|last4=Dunbar|first4=EE|last5=Epter|first5=R|title=A systematic review of therapeutic facet joint interventions in chronic spinal pain.|journal=Pain physician|date=January 2007|volume=10|issue=1|pages=229–53|pmid=17256032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms of action==

===Nerve anatomy===
Each nerve is composed of a bundle of [[axon]]s. Each axon is surrounded by the [[endoneurium]] connective tissue layer. These axons are bundled into fascicles surrounded by the [[perineurium]] connective tissue layer. Multiple fascicles are then surrounded by the [[epineurium]], which is the outermost connective tissue layer of the nerve. The axons of myelinated nerves have a [[myelin]] sheath made up of [[Schwann cells]] that coat the axon.&lt;ref name= "Gray"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gray |first = Henry |date=1918 |title=Gray's Anatomy | location=Philadelphia  | publisher=Lea &amp; Febiger | ISBN=1-58734-102-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nerve injury classification===
[[File:Nerve injury classification table of temperatures required for injury.png|thumb|Nerve injury classification table of temperatures required for injury&lt;ref name=Zhou&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|title=Mechanism research of cryoanalgesia|journal=Neurological Research|date=1995|volume=17|pages=301–311|pmid=7477749|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sunderland&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sunderland|title=Nerves and Nerve Injuries|date=1968|publisher=Livingstone|location=Edinburgh &amp; London|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhou 21"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|title=Cryoanalgesia: electrophysiology at different temperatures|journal=Cryobiology|date=2003|volume=46|pages=26–32|doi=10.1016/s0011-2240(02)00160-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;|x300px]]

Classification of nerve damage was well-defined by Sir Herbert Seddon and Sunderland in a system that remains in use.&lt;ref name = "Seddon"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Seddon HJ | title=Three Types of Nerve Injury | journal=Brain  | volume=66 | issue=4 | year=1943 | pages=238–288 | doi=10.1093/brain/66.4.237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjacent table details the forms ([[neurapraxia]], [[axonotmesis]] and [[neurotmesis]]) and degrees of nerve injury that occur as a result of exposure to various temperatures.

Cryoneurolysis treatments that use [[nitrous oxide]] (boiling point of -88.5&amp;nbsp;°C) as the coolant fall in the range of an [[axonotmesis]] injury, or 2nd degree injury, according to the Sunderland classification system. Treatments of the nerve in this temperature range are reversible. Nerves treated in this temperature range experience a disruption of the [[axon]], with [[Wallerian degeneration]] occurring distal to the site of injury.&lt;ref name=Savastano&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savastano|title=Sciatic nerve injury: A simple and subtle model for investigating many aspects of nervous system damage and recovery|journal=Journal of Neuroscience Methods|date=2014|volume=227|pages=166–180|doi=10.1016/j.jneumeth.2014.01.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The axon and [[myelin sheath]] are affected, but all of the connective tissues ([[endoneurium]], [[perineurium]], and [[epineurium]]) remain intact.&lt;ref name=Hsu&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hsu|title=Reduction in muscular motility by selective focused cold therapy|journal=Journal of Neural Transmission|date=2013|volume=121|pages=15–20|doi=10.1007/s00702-013-1077-y|pmid=23917804|issue=1|pmc=3889817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Wallerian degeneration, the axon regenerates along the original nerve path at a rate of approximately 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm per day.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|title=Cryoanalgesia: the response to alterations in freeze cycle and temperature|journal=British Journal of Anesthesiology|date=1981|volume=53|issue=11|pages=1121–1127|doi=10.1093/bja/53.11.1121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tetzlaff&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tetzlaff|title=Neurofilament elongation into regenerating facial nerve axons|journal=Neuroscience|date=1989|volume=29|issue=3|pages=659–666|doi=10.1016/0306-4522(89)90138-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seil&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seil|title=Nerve, organ, and tissue regeneration--research perspectives|date=1983|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|pages=482|edition=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lundy-Eckman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lundy-Eckman|title=Neuroscience: Fundamentals for rehabilitation|date=2007|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=St. Louis, MIssouri|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryoneurolysis differs from [[cryoablation]] in that cryoablation treatments utilize [[liquid nitrogen]] (boiling point of -195.8&amp;nbsp;°C) as the coolant, and therefore, fall into the range of a [[neurotmesis]] injury, or 3rd degree injury according to the Sunderland classification. Treatments of the nerve in this temperature range are irreversible.

The use of cold for pain relief and as an anti-inflammatory has been known since the time of [[Hippocrates]] (460-377 B.C).&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|title=The History of Cryosurgery|journal=J R Soc Med|date=2001|volume=94|issue=4|pages=196–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then there have been numerous accounts of ice used for pain relief including from the Ancient Egyptians and Avicenna of Persia (A.D.982–1070).&lt;ref name=Trescot&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trescott|title=Cryoanalgesia in Interventional Pain Management|journal=Pain Physician|date=2003|volume=6|pages=345–360}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812 Napoleon's Surgeon General noted that half-frozen soldiers from the Moscow battle were able to tolerate amputations with reduced pain&lt;ref name=Larre&gt;{{cite book |last=Larrey|first=Dominique Jean|date=1832 |title=Surgical Memoirs of the campaigns of Russia, Germany and France|location=Philadelphia |publisher=Carey &amp; Lea}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1851, ice and salt mixtures were promoted by [[James Arnott (physician)|Arnott]] for the treatment of nerve pain. Campbell White, in 1899, was the first to use refrigerants medically, and Allington, in 1950, was the first to use liquid nitrogen for medical treatments.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; In 1961, Cooper et al. created an early cryoprobe that reached -190&amp;nbsp;°C using liquid nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; Shortly thereafter, in 1967, an ophthalmic surgeon named Amoils used carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide to create a cryoprobe that reached -70&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt;

==Devices==

===Cryoprobe===

Cryoneurolysis is performed with a [[cryoprobe]], which is composed of a hollow cannula that contains a smaller inner lumen. The pressurized coolant (nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide or liquid nitrogen) travels down the lumen and expands at the end of the lumen into the tip of the hollow cannula. No coolant exits the cryoprobe. The expansion of the pressurized liquid causes the surrounding area to cool (known as the [[Joule-Thomson effect]]) and the phase change of the liquid to gas also causes the surrounding area to cool. This causes a visible iceball to form and the tissue surrounding the end of the cryoprobe to freeze. The gas form of the coolant then travels up the length of the cryoprobe and is safely expelled. The tissue surrounding the end of the cryoprobe can reach as low as -88.5&amp;nbsp;°C with nitrous oxide as the coolant, and as low as -195.8&amp;nbsp;°C with liquid nitrogen. Temperatures below -100&amp;nbsp;°C are damaging to nerves.

===Other Devices===

The Endocare PerCryo Percutaneous Cryoablation device utilizes argon as a coolant and can be used with 4 different single cryoprobe configurations with a diameter of either 1.7&amp;nbsp;mm (~16 gauge) or 2.4&amp;nbsp;mm (~13 gauge) in diameter .&lt;ref name=Percryo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthtronics.com/sites/default/files/resources/PerCryo-Probe-Reference.pdf|title=The perfect Percryo probe for any procedure|website=HealthTronics|access-date=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Myoscience Iovera° is a handheld device that uses nitrous oxide as a coolant and can be used with a three-probe configuration with a probe diameter of 0.4&amp;nbsp;mm (~27 gauge).&lt;ref name=Iovera&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ioverahealth.com/how_it_works.php|title=Iovera Health - How it Works|website=Myoscience|access-date=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most forms of [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) can be either powered by [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or flywheel energy.  These are ready for immediate use at the instant that the [[mains electricity]] fails, but the small amount of stored [[energy]] they contain makes them suitable for a few seconds or minutes of use only. To get uninterruptible and continuous power supply, a diesel-generator back-up system is needed.

'''Diesel rotary uninterruptible power supply''' devices (DRUPS) combine the functionality of a battery-powered or flywheel-powered UPS and a diesel generator. When mains electricity supply is within specification, an electrical generator with a mass functions as motor to store kinetic energy in an electro-mechanical [[flywheel]]. In combination with a reactor or choke coil, the electrical generator also works as active filter for all sorts of power quality problems, like harmonics, RFI, and frequency variations. When mains electricity supply fails, stored energy in the flywheel is released to drive the electrical generator, which continues to supply power without interruption. At the same time (or with some delay, for example 2 to 11 seconds, to prevent the diesel engine from starting at every incident), the [[diesel engine]] takes over from the flywheel to drive the [[electrical generator]] to make the [[electricity]] required. The electro-magnetic flywheel can continue to support the diesel generator in order to keep a stable output frequency. Typically a DRUPS will have enough fuel to power the load for days or even weeks in the event of failure of the mains electricity supply.

The main advantages of DRUPS equipment compared to battery-powered UPS combined with a diesel-generator are the higher overall system energy efficiency, smaller footprint, use of fewer components, longer technical lifetime (no use of power electronics) and the fact it does not result in chemical waste (no use of batteries).{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The main disadvantages of DRUPS equipment are a more frequent maintenance regimen due to the number of moving parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricalreview.co.uk/features/6038-118165: 'UPS systems - A question of UPS architecture: static or rotary?']&lt;/ref&gt; DRUPS are also typically installed in external buildings due to noise concerns from the generators.

A DRUPS can provide a ride-through time of 15–40 seconds. A flywheel UPS can be installed ahead of typical UPS battery systems to reduce the effects of lightning &amp; switching transients and to increase battery life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facilitiesnet.com/powercommunication/article/Flywheel-UPS-Require-Less-Maintenance--11530 POWER &amp; COMMUNICATION: 'Flywheel UPS Require Less Maintenance' by Greg Livengood - February 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Discovery! The Search for Arabian Oil''''' is a non-fiction book written by [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning American author [[Wallace Stegner]].

Written by Stegner in the late 1950s the book was originally serialized in fourteen parts in the magazine [[Saudi Aramco World]] in 1970-71 and later published in [[Beirut]] [[Lebanon]] in 1971 in a limited press run. In 2005 Selwa Press asked [[Aramco]] for permission to license this work and present it as an illustrated, fully annotated edition that was released in hardcover in September 2007, the first time it was published in the US.

In late 2007 Selwa's right to publish the book under Stegner's name was questioned by the author's former agent, as well as by Stegner's son and by a biographer.&lt;ref name="WashPost"/&gt;

The book outlines the history of [[Aramco]] and the story of the first discoveries of [[oil]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] region and [[Saudi Arabia]].  Stegner wrote a detailed history of the first contacts between representatives from the American oil company Casoc (or Socal) and King [[Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud]] of Saudi Arabia and his concessions to the company to search for oil in the kingdom in the 1930s.

== Book Summary ==

The book outlines the beginnings of the discovery of oil in the Persian Gulf during the 1930s by oil companies from around the world.  The exploration for oil took place during the depression of the 1930s and companies in the US and other countries were hesitant to spend resources looking for oil.  During the 1930s the Persian Gulf, aside from Saudi Arabia, was primarily controlled by the British military and British companies operating in public interest.

The 1930s Kingdom of Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud was a conservative country skeptical of outsiders and the homeland of Islam's main pilgrimige sites and holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]].

The King was also interested in oil exploration though and made concessions to several companies, allowing them to explore for oil in the Kingdom.  Discovery! outlines how American oil officials agreed to share profits with the King, train employees, build roads and towns, and eventually turn Aramco into a Saudi run and owned company in return for revenue and exclusive oil rights.

Following several negotiations outlined in Stegner's book and especially with the help of ex-English intelligence officer and Muslim convert [[St. John Philby]] the American company and the Saudi King agreed to partner.

Stegner's book details the lives of some of the American families who were part of this oil exploration and the unique set of circumstances that they faced living in Saudi Arabia as well as the effect that these families and employees had on the native population of Saudi Arabia.

He also outlines the beginnings of a relationship between US business and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from the 1930s through the end of World War II.

== History of the Book ==

The first manuscript was written by Stegner in 1956 and was submitted to Aramco shortly thereafter.  According to Discovery!'s new introduction officials at the company were hesitant to publish the manuscript due to the political situation in the Middle East with the nationalization of the [[Suez canal]] and the [[pan-Arabism]] of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of [[Egypt]].  The manuscript remained unpublished until a company editor found it in 1967.

Stegner and Aramco compromised on the contents of the book and it began being published in serial form in Saudi Aramco World magazine in 1970.  Stegner's hesitations on writing a public relations campaign for a company were included in the book as well as some of his critiques.

The book was released worldwide in September 2007 with additional annotations, a bibliography, an introduction by author and journalist [[Thomas Lippman]] and unreleased photographs.

==Controversy==

Questions have arisen over Selwa Press' legal right to publish the book with Stegner's name attached.  The dispute centers over whether a 1958 contract between the author and Aramco required Stegner's approval before his name could be used. Publisher Tim Barger said that Stegner had given that approval when the book was serialized in an Aramco magazine in the 1960s.  The author also approved an Aramco-published book in 1971.  But the author's former agent, Carl Brandt, who represents Stegner's estate, called the book "a bowdlerized version of what Wally wrote," and Stegner's son Page said that material critical of Aramco or considered offensive to the company's Saudi partners was removed. Stegner biographer [[Philip L. Fradkin|Philip Fradkin]] said that Stegner was paid for his work and had accordingly permitted an Aramco-published version but did not want that version published as a trade book.&lt;ref name="WashPost"&gt;{{cite news | first= Bob | last=Thompson | coauthors= | title=Was This 'Discovery!' Meant to Be Found? | date=2007-11-29 | publisher= | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/28/AR2007112802404_pf.html | work =The Washington Post | pages =C01 | accessdate = 2007-11-29 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stegner's original draft now resides at the [[University of Utah]]. Barger said that Aramco would never agree to the publication of Stegner's original draft.&lt;ref name="WashPost"/&gt;

'''Docosahexaenoic acid''' ('''DHA''') is an [[omega-3 fatty acid]] that is a primary structural component of the human [[brain]], [[cerebral cortex]], [[skin]], and [[retina]].  In physiological literature, it is given the name 22:6(n-3). It can be synthesized from [[alpha-linolenic acid]] or obtained directly from maternal milk (breast milk), fish oil, or algae oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guesnet P, Alessandri JM |year=2011 |title=Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the developing central nervous system (CNS) - Implications for dietary recommendations |journal=Biochimie |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=7–12 |publisher= |doi= 10.1016/j.biochi.2010.05.005|pmid=20478353 |pmc= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DHA's structure is a [[carboxylic acid]] (-''oic acid'') with a 22-[[carbon chain]] (''docosa-'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] for 22)  and six (''hexa-'') ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|cis]]'' [[double bond]]s (''-en-'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/Docosahexaenoic%20Acids |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707153435/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/Docosahexaenoic%20Acids |archivedate=2013-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the first double bond located at the third carbon from the omega end.&lt;ref&gt;The omega end is the one furthest from the [[carboxyl group]].&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[trivial name]] is '''cervonic acid''', its [[systematic name]] is '''''all-cis''-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexa-enoic acid''', and its shorthand name is '''22:6(n−3)''' in the [[nomenclature of fatty acids]].

Most of the DHA in fish and multi-cellular organisms with access to cold-water oceanic foods originates from photosynthetic and heterotrophic [[microphyte|microalgae]], and becomes increasingly concentrated in organisms the further they are up the food chain. DHA is also commercially manufactured from microalgae: ''[[Crypthecodinium cohnii]]'' and another of the genus ''[[Schizochytrium]]''.&lt;ref name=Martek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboutmartek.martek.com/history/ |author=Martek Biosciences Corporation |title=History of Martek |date=5 April 2007|accessdate=March 10, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070205005919/http://aboutmartek.martek.com/history/  |archivedate = February 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DHA manufactured using microalgae is [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]].&lt;ref name="Martek-2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboutmartek.martek.com/martekproducts/ |author=Martek Biosciences Corporation |title=Martek Products|date=29 July 2008|accessdate=July 29, 2008 |archiveurl = http://martek.com/About/History.aspx  |archivedate = June 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In strict [[herbivores]], DHA is manufactured internally from [[Alpha-linolenic acid|α-linolenic acid]], a shorter omega-3 fatty acid manufactured by plants (and also occurring in animal products as obtained from plants), while [[Omnivore|omnivores]] and [[Carnivore|carnivores]] primarily obtain DHA from their diet.&lt;ref name=Burdge/&gt; Limited amounts of [[Eicosapentaenoic acid|eicosapentaenoic]] and [[docosapentaenoic acid]]s are possible products of α-linolenic acid metabolism in young women&lt;ref name="Burdge1"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Central nervous system constituent==
DHA is the most abundant omega-3 fatty acid in the brain and retina.  DHA comprises 40% of the [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s (PUFAs) in the brain and 60% of the PUFAs in the retina. Five percent of the weight of a [[neuron]]'s [[plasma membrane]] is composed of DHA.&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite web | author = Meharban Singh | title = Essential Fatty Acids, DHA and the Human Brain from the Indian Journal of Pediatrics, Volume 72 | url = http://medind.nic.in/icb/t05/i3/icbt05i3p239.pdf | accessdate = October 8, 2007 |date=March 2005 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolic synthesis==
In humans, DHA is either obtained from the diet or may be converted in small amounts from [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA, 20:5, ω-3) via [[docosapentaenoic acid]] (DPA, 22:5 ω-3) as an intermediate.&lt;ref name=Burdge1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burdge/&gt; This synthesis had been thought to occur through an elongation step followed by the action of Δ4-[[desaturase]].&lt;ref name=Burdge/&gt; It is now considered more likely that DHA is biosynthesized via a C24 intermediate followed by [[beta oxidation]] in [[peroxisome]]s. Thus, EPA is twice elongated, yielding 24:5 ω-3, then desaturated to 24:6 ω-3, then shortened to DHA (22:6 ω-3) via [[beta oxidation]]. This pathway is known as "Sprecher's shunt".&lt;ref name=DeCaterina&gt;{{cite journal

In organisms such as microalgae, mosses and fungi, biosynthesis of DHA usually occurs as a series of desaturation and elongation reactions, catalyzed by the sequential action of desaturase and elongase enzymes. One known pathway in these organisms involves:
# a desaturation at the sixth carbon of [[Alpha-Linolenic acid|alpha-linolenic acid]] by a [[delta 6 desaturase|Δ6 desaturase]] to produce [[stearidonic acid]], 
# elongation of the [[stearidonic acid]] by a [[delta 6 elongase|Δ6 elongase]] to produce to [[eicosatetraenoic acid]], 
# desaturation at the fifth carbon of  [[eicosatetraenoic acid]] by a [[delta 5 desaturase|Δ5 desaturase]] to produce [[eicosapentaenoic acid]],
# elongation of [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] by a [[delta 5 elongase|Δ5 elongase]] to produce [[docosapentaenoic acid]], and
# desaturation at the fourth carbon of [[docosapentaenoic acid]] by a [[Delta 4 desaturase|Δ4 desaturase]] to produce DHA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-02-01|title=Biosynthesis of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6-4, 7,10,13,16,19): two distinct pathways|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952327802002685|journal=Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids|volume=68|issue=2|pages=181–186|doi=10.1016/S0952-3278(02)00268-5|issn=0952-3278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolism==
DHA can be metabolized into DHA-derived [[specialized pro-resolving mediators]] (SPMs), DHA epoxides, electrophilic oxo-derivatives (EFOX) of DHA, neuroprostanes, ethanolamines, acylglycerols, docosahexaenoyl amides of amino acids or neurotransmitters, and branched DHA esters of hydroxy fatty acids, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuda|first1=Ondrej|title=Bioactive metabolites of docosahexaenoic acid|journal=Biochimie|date=2017|doi=10.1016/j.biochi.2017.01.002|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908416302218|accessdate=31 January 2017|volume=136|pages=12–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Electromagnetism|cTopic=Electrostatics}}
In [[physics]] and [[electrical engineering]], a '''conductor''' is an object or type of material that allows the flow of an [[electrical current]] in one or more directions. Materials made of metal are common electrical conductors. Electrical current is generated by the flow of negatively charged electrons, positively charged holes, and positive or negative ions in some cases. 

In order for current to flow, it is not necessary for one charged particle to travel from the machine producing the current to that consuming it. Instead, the charged particle simply needs to nudge its neighbor a finite amount who will nudge its neighbor and on and on until a particle is nudged into the consumer, thus powering the machine. Essentially what is occurring here is a long chain of momentum transfer between mobile charge carriers; the [[Drude model]] of conduction describes this process more rigorously. This momentum transfer model makes metal an ideal choice for a conductor as metals, characteristically, possess a delocalized [[sea of electrons]] which gives the electrons enough mobility to collide and thus effect a momentum transfer. 

As discussed above, electrons are the primary mover in metals; however, other devices such as the cationic [[electrolyte]](s) of a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]], or the mobile protons of the [[proton conductor]] of a fuel cell rely on positive charge carriers. [[Insulator (electricity)|Insulator]]s are non-conducting materials with few mobile charges that support only insignificant [[electric currents]].

==Resistance and conductance==
[[File:Resistivity geometry.png|thumb|A piece of resistive material with electrical contacts on both ends.]]
{{main|Electrical resistance and conductance}}
The resistance of a given conductor depends on the material it is made of, and on its dimensions. For a given material, the resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee281/materials/references/WireResistances.pdf|title=Wire Sizes and Resistance|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a thick copper wire has lower resistance than an otherwise-identical thin copper wire. Also, for a given material, the resistance is proportional to the length; for example, a long copper wire has higher resistance than an otherwise-identical short copper wire. The resistance {{math|''R''}} and conductance {{math|''G''}} of a conductor of uniform cross section, therefore, can be computed as&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
R &amp; = \rho \frac \ell A, \\[6pt]
G &amp; = \sigma \frac A \ell.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the conductor, measured in [[metre]]s [m], ''A'' is the cross-section area of the conductor measured in [[square metre]]s [m²], σ ([[Sigma (letter)|sigma]]) is the [[electrical conductivity]] measured in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per meter (S·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), and ρ ([[Rho (letter)|rho]]) is the [[electrical resistivity]] (also called ''specific electrical resistance'') of the material, measured in ohm-metres (Ω·m). The resistivity and conductivity are proportionality constants, and therefore depend only on the material the wire is made of, not the geometry of the wire. Resistivity and conductivity are [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]]: &lt;math&gt;\rho=1/\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Resistivity is a measure of the material's ability to oppose electric current.

This formula is not exact: It assumes the [[current density]] is totally uniform in the conductor, which is not always true in practical situations. However, this formula still provides a good approximation for long thin conductors such as wires.

Another situation this formula is not exact for is with [[alternating current]] (AC), because the [[skin effect]] inhibits current flow near the center of the conductor. Then, the ''geometrical'' cross-section is different from the ''effective'' cross-section in which current actually flows, so the resistance is higher than expected. Similarly, if two conductors are near each other carrying AC current, their resistances increase due to the [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]]. At [[utility frequency|commercial power frequency]], these  effects are significant for large conductors carrying large currents, such as [[busbar]]s in an [[electrical substation]],&lt;ref&gt;Fink and Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Edition'', pages 17–19&lt;/ref&gt; or large power cables carrying more than a few hundred amperes.

Aside from the geometry of the wire, temperature also has a significant effect on the efficacy of conductors. Temperature affects conductors in two main ways, the first is that materials may expand under the application of heat. The amount that the material will expand is governed by the [[thermal expansion coefficient]] specific to the material. Such an expansion (or contraction) will change the geometry of the conductor and therefore its characteristic resistance. However, this effect is generally small, on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;. An increase in temperature will also increase the number of phonons generated within the material. A [[phonon]] is essentially a lattice vibration, or rather a small, harmonic kinetic movement of the atoms of the material. Much like the shaking of a pinball machine, phonons serve to disrupt the path of electrons, causing them to scatter. This electron scattering will decrease the number of electron collisions and therefore will decrease the total amount of current transferred.

Conduction materials include [[metal]]s, [[electrolyte]]s, [[superconductor]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s and some nonmetallic conductors such as [[graphite]] and [[Conductive polymer]]s.

[[Copper]] has a high [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]]. [[Annealing (metallurgy)|Annealed]] copper is the international standard to which all other electrical conductors are compared; the [[International Annealed Copper Standard]] conductivity is {{val|58|u=MS|up=m}}, although ultra-pure copper can slightly exceed 101% IACS.  The main grade of copper used for electrical applications, such as building wire, [[Electric motor|motor]] windings, cables and [[busbar]]s, is [[Oxygen-free copper#Specification|electrolytic-tough pitch (ETP) copper]] (CW004A or [[ASTM]] designation C100140).  If high conductivity copper must be [[welding|welded]] or [[Brazing|brazed]] or used in a reducing atmosphere, then [[Oxygen-free copper|oxygen-free high conductivity copper]] (CW008A or ASTM designation C10100) may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/alloys/copper/ |title=High conductivity coppers (electrical) |publisher=Copper Development Association (U.K.) |accessdate=2013-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720000331/http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/alloys/copper/ |archivedate=2013-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its ease of connection by [[soldering]] or clamping, copper is still the most common choice for most light-gauge wires.

[[Silver]] is 6% more conductive than copper, but due to cost it is not practical in most cases. However, it is used in specialized equipment, such as [[satellite]]s, and as a thin plating to mitigate [[skin effect]] losses at high frequencies.  Famously, {{convert|14700|ST|t}} of silver on loan from the Treasury were used in the making of the [[calutron]] magnets during World War II due to wartime shortages of copper.

[[Aluminum]] wire is the most common metal in [[electric power transmission]] and [[Electric power distribution|distribution]].  Although only 61% of the conductivity of copper by cross-sectional area, its lower density makes it twice as conductive by mass.  As aluminum is roughly one-third the cost of copper by weight, the economic advantages are considerable when large conductors are required.

The disadvantages of aluminum wiring lie in its mechanical and chemical properties.  It readily forms an insulating oxide, making connections heat up.  Its larger [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] than the brass materials used for connectors causes connections to loosen.  Aluminum can also "creep", slowly deforming under load, which also loosens connections.  These effects can be mitigated with suitably designed connectors and extra care in installation, but they have made [[aluminum building wiring]] unpopular past the [[service drop]].

Organic compounds such as octane, which has 8 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms, cannot conduct electricity. Oils are hydrocarbons, since  carbon has the property of tetracovalency and forms covalent bonds with other elements such as hydrogen, since it does not lose or gain electrons, thus does not form ions. Covalent bonds are simply the sharing of electrons. Hence, there is no separation of ions when electricity is passed through it. So the liquid (oil or any organic compound) cannot conduct electricity.

While pure [[water]] is not an electrical conductor, even a small portion of ionic impurities, such as [[salt]], can rapidly transform it into a conductor.

==Wire size==
Wires are measured by their cross sectional area. In many countries, the size is expressed in square millimetres. In North America, conductors are measured by [[American wire gauge]] for smaller ones, and [[circular mils]] for larger ones. The size of a wire contributes to its ampacity. The [[American wire gauge]] article contains a table showing allowable ampacities for a variety of copper wire sizes.

==Conductor ampacity==
The [[ampacity]] of a conductor, that is, the amount of [[Electric current|current]] it can carry, is related to its electrical resistance: a lower-resistance conductor can carry a larger value of current. The resistance, in turn, is determined by the material the conductor is made from (as described above) and the conductor's size. For a given material, conductors with a larger cross-sectional area have less resistance than conductors with a smaller cross-sectional area.

For bare conductors, the ultimate limit is the point at which power lost to resistance causes the conductor to melt. Aside from [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]], most conductors in the real world are operated far below this limit, however. For example, household wiring is usually insulated with [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] insulation that is only rated to operate to about 60&amp;nbsp;°C, therefore, the current in such wires must be limited so that it never heats the copper conductor above 60&amp;nbsp;°C, causing a risk of [[fire]]. Other, more expensive insulation such as [[Teflon]] or [[fiberglass]] may allow operation at much higher temperatures.

==Isotropy==
If an [[electric field]] is applied to a material, and the resulting induced [[electric current]] is in the same direction, the material is said to be an ''isotropic electrical conductor''.  If the resulting electric current is in a different direction from the applied electric field, the material is said to be an ''anisotropic electrical conductor''.

The '''Elektrische Viktoria''' was an [[electric car]] built in several versions by [[Siemens]] between 1905 and 1909 in [[Berlin]]. The versions comprised a four-seat convertible (advertised and used as a hotel taxi), a minibus with a box-like structure (much like a pickup), and a van.

Top [[speed]] was 30&amp;nbsp;km/h (19&amp;nbsp;mi/h). The [[electric motor]] operated at a nominal potential of 88 [[volt]]s and a maximum current of 40 [[ampere]]s. The maximum power was 3.520 [[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]] (about 4.8 [[Horsepower|HP]]). The cruising range was 60&amp;nbsp;km with the smaller battery version and 80&amp;nbsp;km with the larger battery version.

The car was built in the Berlin-based factory Siemens-Schuckertwerke, a Siemens subsidiary. The total number of units built is not known, but, according to Siemens internal records, probably between 30 and 50 were produced. The price was steep by 1905 standards, at 11000 to 17500 [[German gold mark|Marks]], depending on the model and battery capacity.  At the time, a worker's monthly wages were in the range of 120 to 150 Marks.

== Development ==
[[Regenerative brake|Regenerative braking]] was added during development, i.e., while braking the electric motor's operation was reversed, turning it into an electric generator charging the battery, such that the available kinetic energy could be turned into extended cruising range.

== 2010 replica ==
In 2010 Siemens built a full-scale replica, based on partial sketches and three photographic images. Only the [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] was modified for environmental reasons, avoiding the original [[lead]] based battery technology. The lighting was modernized in order to receive official approval for operation on public roads. Siemens rebuilt the city car type B "Electrical Viktoria open". The weight is 1530&amp;nbsp;kg, to which the battery alone contributes 480&amp;nbsp;kg. Fully charging the battery takes between five and a half to six hours on 220 volt mains. The car was approved on April 8, 2010 and presented to the public in Berlin on April 30.&lt;ref&gt;see also:''105 Jahre Elektromobilität in Berlin. Vom Historischen Elektrotaxi bis zur Mobilitätsinfrastruktur der Zukunft'', article in the Siemenswelt, May 2010, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 21, 2010, the replica was involved an accident in the environs of [[Hinterzarten]], a resort village in the Black Forest, when the car suddenly veered off the road and into an embankment at full speed. The driver and leader of the replica project, [[Wilfried Feldenkirchen]], a professor of economic history, was killed, when he was ejected from the car.  Four accompanying students were injured, two seriously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badische-zeitung.de/titisee-neustadt/feldkirchen-stirbt-bei-fahrt-mit-elektro-oldtimer--32483811.html'' Feldenkirchen stirbt bei Fahrt mit Elektro-Oldtimer''] In: [[Badische Zeitung]] online vom 21.

An '''energy slave''' is that quantity of energy (ability to do work) which, when used to construct and drive non-human [[infrastructure]] ([[machine]]s, [[road]]s, [[Electric power|power grids]], [[fuel]], draft animals, [[Windpump|wind-driven pumps]], etc.) replaces a unit of [[Manual labor|human labor]] (actual work). An energy slave does the work of a person, through the [[energy consumption|consumption of energy]] in the non-human infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The first measured century: an illustrated guide to trends in America, 1900-2000|first1=Theodore|last1= Caplow|first2= Louis |last2=Hicks|first3= Ben J. |last3=Wattenberg|publisher= [[American Enterprise Institute]] |year= 2001|ISBN=0-8447-4138-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was first used by [[R. Buckminster Fuller]] in the caption of an illustration for the cover of the February 1940 issue of [[Fortune Magazine]], entitled "World Energy".  [[Alfred Ubbelohde]] also coined the term, apparently independently, in his 1955 book, "Man and Energy", but the term did not come to be widely used until the 1960s, and is generally credited to Fuller.

==Usage==
An energy slave is used to compare the productivity of a person and the energy that would be required to produce that work in the modern, [[oil|oil fuelled]] industrial [[economy]], although it could be applied anywhere that labor is produced with non-human sourced energy. It does not include the ancillary [[Environmental economics|costs]] of [[Environmental degradation|damage to the environment]] or social structures.  Formally, one energy slave produces one unit of human labor through the non-human tools and energy supplied by the industrial economy, and therefore 1 ES times a constant that converts to work accomplished = 1 human labor unit.

'''Hydrotropism''' (hydro- "water"; tropism "involuntary orientation by an organism, that involves turning or curving as a positive or negative response to a stimulus")&lt;ref&gt;condensed definitions, ''Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; is a plant's growth response in which the direction of growth is determined by a stimulus or gradient in water concentration. A common example is a plant root growing in humid air bending toward a higher relative humidity level.

This is of biological significance as it helps to increase efficiency of the plant in its ecosystem.

The process of hydrotropism is started by the root cap sensing water and sending a signal to the elongating part of the root. Hydrotropism is difficult to observe in underground roots, since the roots are not readily observable, and root [[gravitropism]] is usually more influential than root hydrotropism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Takahashi N, Yamazaki Y, Kobayashi A, Higashitani A, Takahashi H |title=Hydrotropism interacts with gravitropism by degrading amyloplasts in seedling roots of Arabidopsis and radish |journal=Plant Physiol. |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=805–810 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12805610 |pmc=167020 |doi=10.1104/pp.102.018853 |url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12805610}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Water readily moves in soil and soil water content is constantly changing so any gradients in soil moisture are not stable.

Root hydrotropism research has mainly been a laboratory phenomenon for roots grown in humid air rather than soil. Its ecological significance in soil-grown roots is unclear because so little hydrotropism research has examined soil-grown roots. Recent identification of a mutant plant that lacks a hydrotropic response may help to elucidate its role in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Eapen D, Barroso ML, Campos ME, etal |title=A no hydrotropic response root mutant that responds positively to gravitropism in Arabidopsis |journal=Plant Physiol. |volume=131 |issue=2 |pages=536–546 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12586878 |pmc=166830 |doi=10.1104/pp.011841 |url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12586878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrotropism may have importance for plants grown in space, where it may allow roots to orient themselves in a microgravity environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Takahashi H, Brown CS, Dreschel TW, Scott TK |title=Hydrotropism in pea roots in a porous-tube water delivery system |journal=HortScience |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=430–432 |date=May 1992 |pmid=11537612 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
A class of plant hormones called [[auxins]] coordinates this root growth process. Auxins play a key role in bending the plants root towards the water because they cause one side of the root to grow faster than the other and thus the bending of the root. The Auxins are also important to plant life because they help search for water.

==Misconceptions==
* The greater growth of roots in moist soil zones than in dry soil zones is not usually a result of hydrotropism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hershey DR |title=Is hydrotropism all wet? |journal=Science Activities |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=20–24 |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrotropism requires a root to bend from a drier to a wetter soil zone. Roots require water to grow so roots that happen to be in moist soil will grow and branch much more than those in dry soil.
* Roots cannot sense water inside intact pipes via hydrotropism and break the pipes to obtain the water.
* Roots cannot sense water several feet away via hydrotropism and grow toward it. At best hydrotropism probably operates over distances of a couple millimeters″

'''Lumber''' (American English; used only in North America) or '''timber''' (used in the rest of the English-speaking world) is a type of [[wood]] that has been processed into [[Beam (structure)|beams]] and [[plank (wood)|planks]], a stage in the process of [[wood production]]. Lumber is mainly used for structural purposes but has many other uses as well.

There are two main types of lumber. It may be supplied either rough-[[sawmill|sawn]], or surfaced on one or more of its faces. Besides [[pulpwood]], ''rough lumber'' is the raw material for [[furniture]]-making and other items requiring additional cutting and shaping. It is available in many species, usually [[hardwood]]s; but it is also readily available in [[softwood]]s, such as [[Pinus classification|white pine]] and [[red pine]], because of their low cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southern Pine Cost Estimates|url=http://patscolor.com/materials/timber/the-southern-yellow-pine-flooring-decking-guide/|website=patscolor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Finished lumber'' is supplied in standard sizes, mostly for the construction industry – primarily [[softwood]], from [[conifer]]ous species, including [[pine]], [[fir]] and [[spruce]] (collectively [[spruce-pine-fir]]), [[Cedrus|cedar]], and [[Tsuga|hemlock]], but also some hardwood, for high-grade flooring. It is more commonly made from softwood than hardwoods, and 80% of lumber comes from softwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diffen.com/difference/Hardwood_vs_Softwood|title=Hardwood vs Softwood – Difference and Comparison |publisher=Diffen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

In the United States milled boards of wood are referred to as ''lumber''. However, in Britain and other Commonwealth nations, the term ''[[wikt:timber|timber]]'' is instead used to describe sawn wood products, like floor boards.

In the United States and Canada, generally ''timber'' describes standing or felled trees. Specifically in Canada, ''lumber'' describes cut and surfaced wood.&lt;ref name="CRD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptual Reference Database for Building Envelope Research|url=http://alcor.concordia.ca/~raojw/crd/concept/concept000069.html|accessdate=2008-03-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223221704/http://alcor.concordia.ca/~raojw/crd/concept/concept000069.html|archivedate=2008-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the word ''lumber'' is rarely used in relation to wood and has several other meanings, including unused or unwanted items. Referring to wood, ''Timber'' is almost universally used instead.

===Remanufactured lumber===
{{See also|Timber recycling}}
Remanufactured lumber is the result of secondary or tertiary processing/cutting of previously milled lumber. Specifically, it is lumber cut for industrial or [[Wood packaging|wood-packaging]] use. Lumber is cut by ripsaw or [[resaw]] to create dimensions that are not usually processed by a primary [[sawmill]].

Resawing is the splitting of 1-inch through 12-inch [[hardwood]] or [[softwood]] lumber into two or more thinner pieces of full-length boards. For example, splitting a ten-foot 2×4 into two ten-foot 1×4s is considered resawing.

===Plastic lumber===
{{Further|Plastic lumber|Fiber-reinforced composite|Wood-plastic composite}}
Structural lumber may also be produced from recycled plastic and new plastic stock. Its introduction has been strongly opposed by the [[forestry]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volokh.com/sasha/resrec.html "Recycling and Deregulation: Opportunities for Market Development"] ''Resource Recycling,'' September 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Blending fiberglass in plastic lumber enhances its strength, durability, and fire resistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/SUBCOMMIT/D2020.htm "ASTM D6108 – 09 Standard Test Method for Compressive Properties of Plastic Lumber and Shapes"] ''ASTM Committee D20.20 on Plastic Lumber''&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic [[fiberglass]] structural lumber can have a "class 1 [[flame spread]] rating of 25 or less, when tested in accordance with [[ASTM]] standard E 84," which means it burns slower than almost all treated wood lumber.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strongwell.com/PDFfiles/Safdeck%20Safplank/SAFPLANK%20SAFDECK%20Fiberglass%20Decking%20Systems%20Brochure.pdf "SAFPLANK Interlocking Decking System"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426205658/http://www.strongwell.com/PDFfiles/Safdeck%20Safplank/SAFPLANK%20SAFDECK%20Fiberglass%20Decking%20Systems%20Brochure.pdf |date=2013-04-26 }} ''Strongwell.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion of wood logs==
Logs are ''converted'' into timber by being sawn, [[Hewing|hewn]], or [[Wood splitting|split]]. Sawing with a [[rip saw]] is the most common method, because sawing allows logs of lower quality, with irregular grain and large knots, to be used and is more economical. There are various types of sawing:
* Plain sawn (flat sawn, through and through, bastard sawn) – A log sawn through without adjusting the position of the log and the grain runs across the width of the boards.
* [[Quarter sawing|Quarter sawn]] and [[Rift sawing|rift sawn]] – These terms have been confused in history but generally mean lumber sawn so the annual rings are reasonably perpendicular to the sides (not edges) of the lumber.
* Boxed heart – The [[pith]] remains within the piece with some allowance for exposure.
* Heart center – the center core of a log.
* Free of heart center (FOHC) – A side-cut timber without any pith.
* Free of knots (FOK) – No knots are present.

==Dimensional lumber==
{{Globalise/North America|section|date=October 2014}}
[[File:2 By 4 Clue Stick.jpg|thumb|A common 2×4 board]]
Dimensional lumber is lumber that is cut to standardized width and depth, specified in [[inch]]es. [[Carpentry|Carpenters]] extensively use dimensional lumber in [[Framing (construction)|framing]] wooden buildings. Common sizes include ''2×4'' (pictured) (also ''two-by-four'' and other variants, such as ''four-by-two'' in Australia, New Zealand, and the UK), ''2×6'', and ''4×4''. The length of a board is usually specified separately from the width and depth. It is thus possible to find 2×4s that are four, eight, and twelve feet in length. In [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], the standard lengths of lumber are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 feet (1.83, 2.44, 3.05, 3.66, 4.27, 4.88, 5.49, 6.10, 6.71 and 7.32 meters).  For wall framing, "stud" or "precut" sizes are available, and are commonly used. For an eight-, nine-, or ten-foot ceiling height, [[Wall stud|studs]] are available in {{convert|92+5/8|in|cm}}, {{convert|104+5/8|in|cm}}, and {{convert|116+5/8|in|cm}}. The term "stud" is used inconsistently to specify length; where the exact length matters, one must specify the length explicitly.

===Historical Chinese construction===
Under the prescription of the '''Method of Construction''' (營造法式) issued by the [[Southern Song]] government in the early 12th century, timbers were standardized to eight cross-sectional dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=李|first1=誡|title=營造法式|date=1103|publisher=Song Government|location=China|url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E7%87%9F%E9%80%A0%E6%B3%95%E5%BC%8F/%E7%AC%AC%E5%9B%9B%E5%8D%B7|accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless of the actual dimensions of the timber, the ratio between width and height was maintained at 1:1.5.  Units are in Song Dynasty inches (3.12&amp;nbsp;cm).

|}

Timber smaller than the 8th class were called "unclassed" (等外).  The width of a timber is referred to as one "timber" (材), and the dimensions of other structural components were quoted in multiples of "timber"; thus, as the width of the actual timber varied, the dimensions of other components were easily calculated, without resorting to specific figures for each scale.  The dimensions of timbers in similar application show a gradual diminution from the Sui Dyansty (580~618) to the modern era; a 1st class timber during the Sui was reconstructed as 15×10 (Sui Dynasty inches, or 2.94&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=王|first1=貴祥|title=关于隋唐洛阳宫乾阳殿与乾元殿的平面_结构与形式之探讨|journal=中國建築史論匯刊|volume=3|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North American softwoods===
The length of a unit of dimensional lumber is limited by the height and girth of the tree it is milled from.  In general the maximum length is {{convert|24|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}. Engineered wood products, manufactured by binding the strands, particles, fibers, or veneers of wood, together with adhesives, to form composite materials, offer more flexibility and greater structural strength than typical wood building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturallywood.com/Build-and-Design/Wood-Applications/Engineered-Wood-Products.aspx|title=Naturally:wood|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522030232/http://www.naturallywood.com/Build-and-Design/Wood-Applications/Engineered-Wood-Products.aspx|archivedate=2016-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-cut studs save a framer much time, because they are pre-cut by the manufacturer for use in 8-, 9-, and 10-ft (2.44, 2.74 and 3.05&amp;nbsp;m) ceiling applications, which means the manufacturer has removed a few inches or centimetres of the piece to allow for the sill plate and the double top plate with no additional sizing necessary.

In the [[Americas]], ''two-bys'' (2×4s, 2×6s, 2×8s, 2×10s, and 2×12s), named for traditional board thickness in inches, along with the 4×4 ({{convert|3.5|×|3.5|in|mm|0|disp=out}}), are common lumber sizes used in modern construction. They are the basic building blocks for such common structures as [[balloon framing|balloon-frame]] or [[platform framing|platform-frame]] housing. Dimensional lumber made from [[softwood]] is typically used for construction, while [[hardwood]] boards are more commonly used for making cabinets or [[furniture]].

Lumber's [[Real versus nominal value#Engineering|''nominal'' dimensions]] are larger than the actual standard dimensions of finished lumber.  Historically, the nominal dimensions were the size of the green (not dried), rough (unfinished) boards that eventually became smaller finished lumber through drying and planing (to smooth the wood).  Today, the standards specify the final finished dimensions and the mill cuts the logs to whatever size it needs to achieve those final dimensions.  Typically, that rough cut is smaller than the nominal dimensions because modern technology makes it possible and it uses the logs more efficiently.  For example, a "2×4" board historically started out as a green, rough board actually {{convert|2|×|4|in}}.  After drying and planing, it would be smaller, by a nonstandard amount.  Today, a "2×4" board starts out as something smaller than 2 inches by 4 inches and not specified by standards, and after drying and planing is reliably {{convert|1+1/2|×|3+1/2|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://roofonline.com/american-softwood-lumber-standard|title=American Softwood Lumber Standard|website=Roof Online|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early standards called for green rough lumber to be of full nominal dimension when dry. However, the dimensions have diminished over time.  In 1910, a typical finished {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} board was {{convert|13/16|in|mm|abbr=on}}.  In 1928, that was reduced by 4%, and yet again by 4% in 1956.  In 1961, at a meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona, the Committee on Grade Simplification and Standardization agreed to what is now the current U.S. standard: in part, the dressed size of a 1-inch (nominal) board was fixed at {{frac|3|4}}&amp;nbsp;inch; while the dressed size of 2&amp;nbsp;inch (nominal) lumber was ''reduced'' from {{frac|1|5|8}}&amp;nbsp;inch to the current {{frac|1|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;inch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/misc/miscpub_6409.pdf|author=Smith, L. W. and L. W. Wood|date=1964|title=History of yard lumber size standards|publisher=USDA Forest Service, Forest Product Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dimensional lumber is available in green, unfinished state, and for that kind of lumber, the nominal dimensions are the actual dimensions.

===Grades and standards===
[[File:The longest board in the world (2002).jpg|thumb|The longest board in the world (2002) is in Poland and measures 36.83 metres (about 120 ft 10 in) long.]]
Individual pieces of lumber exhibit a wide range in quality and appearance with respect to knots, slope of grain, shakes and other natural characteristics. Therefore, they vary considerably in strength, utility, and value.

The move to set national standards for lumber in the United States began with publication of the American Lumber Standard in 1924, which set specifications for lumber dimensions, grade, and moisture content; it also developed  inspection and accreditation programs.  These standards have changed over the years to meet the changing needs of manufacturers and distributors, with the goal of keeping lumber competitive with other construction products. Current standards are set by the American Lumber Standard Committee, appointed by the [[United States Secretary of Commerce|U.S. Secretary of Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alsc.org/geninfo_history_mod.htm|title=American Lumber Standard Committee: History|website=www.alsc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design values for most species and grades of visually graded structural products are determined in accordance with [[ASTM]] standards, which consider the effect of strength reducing characteristics, load duration, safety and other influencing factors. The applicable standards are based on results of tests conducted in cooperation with the [[USDA]] Forest Products Laboratory. Design Values for Wood Construction, which is a supplement to the ANSI/AF&amp;PA National Design Specification® for Wood Construction, provides these lumber design values, which are recognized by the model building codes.&lt;ref name="WoodWorks Structural Properties and Performance"&gt;{{cite web|title=Structural Properties and Performance|url=http://www.woodworks.org/wp-content/uploads/Wood-design-structural-properties-performance-fact-sheet.pdf|website=woodworks.org|publisher=WoodWorks|accessdate=May 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada has grading rules that maintain a standard among mills manufacturing similar woods to assure customers of uniform quality. Grades standardize the quality of lumber at different levels and are based on moisture content, size, and manufacture at the time of grading, shipping, and unloading by the buyer. The National Lumber Grades Authority (NLGA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlga.org/app/dynarea/view_article/1.html|title=National Lumber Grades Authority (Canada)|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113224/http://www.nlga.org/app/dynarea/view_article/1.html|archivedate=2011-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for writing, interpreting and maintaining Canadian lumber grading rules and standards. The Canadian Lumber Standards Accreditation Board (CLSAB)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clsab.ca/|title=CLSAB and Lumber Grading Quality |publisher= Canadian Lumber Standards Accreditation Board|website=www.clsab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; monitors the quality of Canada's lumber grading and identification system.

Attempts to maintain lumber quality over time have been challenged by historical changes in the timber resources of the United States – from the slow-growing [[virgin forest]]s common over a century ago to the fast-growing [[Forest#Forest plantations|plantations]] now common in today's commercial forests.  Resulting declines in lumber quality have been of concern to both the [[lumber industry]] and consumers and have caused increased use of alternative construction products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neo.ne.gov/home_const/factsheets/min_use_lumber.htm|title=Minimizing the use of lumber products in residential construction|publisher=Nebraska Energy Office|website=www.neo.ne.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.washington.edu/Research/factSheets/11-CINTRAmatsubstitute.pdf|title=Material substitution in the U.S. residential construction industry|publisher=[[University of Washington]], School of Forest Resources|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620142144/http://www.cfr.washington.edu/research/factSheets/11-CINTRAmatsubstitute.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine stress-rated and machine-evaluated lumber is readily available for end-uses where high strength is critical, such as [[truss]]es, [[rafter]]s, laminating stock, [[I-joist|I-beams]] and web joints. Machine grading measures a characteristic such as stiffness or density that correlates with the structural properties of interest, such as [[bending strength]]. The result is a more precise understanding of the strength of each piece of lumber than is possible with visually graded lumber, which allows designers to use full-design strength and avoid overbuilding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturallywood.com/Wood-Products/Wood-Performance/Grades-and-Quality.aspx|title=Naturally:wood|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522205856/http://naturallywood.com/Wood-Products/Wood-Performance/Grades-and-Quality.aspx|archivedate=2016-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, strength grading of rectangular sawn timber (both softwood and hardwood) is done according to EN-14081 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Strength grading of sawn timber in Europe: an explanation for engineers and researchers|first1=Dan|last1=Ridley-Ellis|first2=Peter|last2=Stapel|first3=Vanesa|last3=Baño|date=1 May 2016|journal=European Journal of Wood and Wood Products|volume=74|issue=3|pages=291–306|doi=10.1007/s00107-016-1034-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly sorted into classes defined by EN-338. For softwoods the common classes are (in increasing strength) C16, C18, C24 and C30.  There are also classes specifically for hardwoods and those in most common use (in increasing strength) are D24, D30, D40, D50, D60 and D70. For these classes, the number refers to the required 5th percentile bending strength in Newtons per square millimetre. There are other strength classes, including T-classes based on tension intended for use in [[glulam]].
* C14, used for [[scaffolding]] and [[formwork]]
* C16 and C24, general construction
* C30, prefab roof trusses and where design requires somewhat stronger [[joist]]s than C24 can offer. TR26 is also a common trussed rafter strength class in long standing use in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.napier.ac.uk/cwst/what-is-tr26/|title=What is TR26? |publisher= Centre for Wood Science &amp; Technology|date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* C40, usually seen in [[glulam]]

Grading rules for African and South American sawn timber have been developed by ATIBT&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atibt.com/ ATIBT]&lt;/ref&gt; according to the rules of the Sciages Avivés Tropicaux Africains (SATA) and is based on clear cuttings – established by the percentage of the clear surface.&lt;ref name="fordaq"&gt;{{cite web|title=African and South American sawn timber|url=http://www.fordaq.com/fordaq/html/quality_africa_sata_En.htm|website=www.fordaq.com|publisher=Fordaq S.A., The Timber Network|accessdate=May 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North American hardwoods===
In North America, market practices for dimensional lumber made from hardwoods{{efn
  |Because working expensive hardwoods is far more difficult and costly, and because an odd width might well be conserved and be of use in making such surfaces as a cabinet side or table top [[jointer|joined]] from many smaller widths, the industry generally only does minimal processing, preserving as much board width as is practicable. This leaves culling and width decisions totally in the hands of the craftsman building [[cabinetry|cabinets]] or [[furniture]] with the boards.
  }} varies significantly from the regularized ''standardized '[[dimension lumber]]' sizes'' used for sales and specification of softwoods – hardwood boards are often sold totally rough cut,{{ efn
 | In quarter sawn thicknesses, meaning the thickness and width dimensions as they come out of the sawmills table. Because lengths vary most with temperature, hardwoods boards in the US often have a bit of extra length.
 }} or machine planed only on the two (broader) face sides. When Hardwood Boards are also supplied with planed faces, it is usually both by random widths of a specified thickness (normally matching milling of softwood dimensional lumbers) and somewhat random lengths. But besides those older (traditional and normal) situations, in recent years some product lines have been widened to also market boards in standard stock sizes; these usually retail in [[big-box store]]s and using only a relatively small set of specified lengths;{{efn
  |small set of specified lengths: Fixed length hardwood boards in the United States are most common in 4–6' lengths, with a good representation of 8' lengths in a variety of widths, and a few widths with occasional dimensional sizes to 12' lengths. Often the longer sizes would need be special ordered.
  }} in all cases hardwoods are sold to the consumer by the [[board-foot]] ({{convert|144|cuin|disp=or}}), whereas that [[measurement system|measure]] is not used for softwoods at the retailer (to the cognizance of the buyer).{{efn
  |name=On Australia|1= Fixed board lengths do not apply in all countries; for example, in Australia and the United States, many hardwood boards are sold to timber yards in packs with a common width profile (dimensions) but not necessarily consisting of boards of identical lengths.}}

Also in North America, hardwood lumber is commonly sold in a "quarter" system, when referring to thickness; 4/4 (four quarter) refers to a {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} board, 8/4 (eight quarter) is a {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} board, etc. This "quarter" system is rarely used for softwood lumber; although softwood decking is sometimes sold as 5/4, even though it is actually one-inch thick (from milling 1/8th inch off each side in a motorized [[thickness planer|planing step]] of production).
The "quarter" system of reference is a traditional ([[culture|cultural]]) North American lumber industry nomenclature used specifically to indicate the thickness of rough sawn hardwood lumber.

The following paragraph is exactly backwards from North American cultural practices where finished retail and rough lumber share the same terminology, as is discussed in the paragraph after about 'architects, designers, and builders':
In rough sawn lumber it immediately clarifies that the lumber is not yet milled, avoiding confusion with milled dimension lumber which is measured as actual thickness after machining. Examples – 3/4", 19mm, or 1x.
In recent years architects, designers, and builders have begun to use the "quarter" system in specifications as a vogue of insider knowledge, though the materials being specified are finished lumber, thus conflating  the separate systems and causing confusion.

Hardwoods cut for furniture are cut in the fall and winter, after the sap has stopped running in the trees. If hardwoods are cut in the spring or summer the sap ruins the natural color of the timber and decreases the value of the timber for furniture.

===Engineered lumber===
{{main|Engineered lumber}}

[[Engineered lumber]] is lumber created by a manufacturer and designed for a certain structural purpose. The main categories of engineered lumber are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austin Energy page describing engineered structural lumber|url=http://www.austinenergy.com/Energy%20Efficiency/Programs/Green%20Building/Sourcebook/engineeredStructuralProducts.htm|accessdate=2006-09-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822023120/http://www.austinenergy.com/Energy%20Efficiency/Programs/Green%20Building/Sourcebook/engineeredStructuralProducts.htm|archivedate=2006-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Laminated veneer lumber|Laminated veneer lumber (LVL)]] – LVL comes in {{frac|1|3|4}} inch thicknesses with depths such as {{frac|9|1|2}}, {{frac|11|7|8}}, 14, 16, 18, and 24&amp;nbsp;inches, and are often doubled or tripled up. They function as beams to provide support over large spans, such as removed support walls and garage door openings, places where dimensional lumber is insufficient, and also in areas where a heavy load is bearing from a floor, wall or roof above on a somewhat short span where dimensional lumber is  impractical. This type of lumber is compromised if it is altered by holes or notches anywhere within the span or at the ends, but nails can be driven into it wherever necessary to anchor the beam or to add hangers for I-joists or dimensional lumber joists that terminate at an LVL beam.
* Wooden I-joists – sometimes called "TJI", "Trus Joists" or "BCI", all of which are brands of wooden I-joists, they are used for floor joists on upper floors and also in first floor conventional foundation construction on piers as opposed to slab floor construction. They are engineered for long spans and are doubled up in places where a wall will be aligned over them, and sometimes tripled where heavy roof-loaded support walls are placed above them. They consist of a top and bottom chord or flange made from dimensional lumber with a webbing in-between made from oriented strand board (OSB) (or, latterly, steel mesh forms which allow passage of services without cutting). The webbing can be removed up to certain sizes or shapes according to the manufacturer's or engineer's specifications, but for small holes, wooden I-joists come with "knockouts", which are perforated, pre-cut areas where holes can be made easily, typically without engineering approval. When large holes are needed, they can typically be made in the webbing only and only in the center third of the span; the top and bottom chords lose their integrity if cut. Sizes and shapes of the hole, and typically the placing of a hole itself, must be approved by an engineer prior to the cutting of the hole and in many areas, a sheet showing the calculations made by the engineer must be provided to the building inspection authorities before the hole will be approved. Some I-joists are made with W-style webbing like a truss to eliminate cutting and to allow ductwork to pass through.[[File:Freshlycutlogs.JPG|upright=1.15|thumb|right|Freshly cut logs showing sap running from beneath bark]]
* [[Finger joint|Finger-jointed lumber]] – solid dimensional lumber lengths typically are limited to lengths of 22 to 24 feet, but can be made longer by the technique of "finger-jointing" by using small solid pieces, usually 18 to 24&amp;nbsp;inches long, and joining them together using finger joints and glue to produce lengths that can be up to 36 feet long in 2×6 size. Finger-jointing also is predominant in precut wall studs. It is also an affordable alternative for non-structural hardwood that will be painted (staining would leave the finger-joints visible). Care is taken during construction to avoid nailing directly into a glued joint as stud breakage can occur.
* [[Glued laminated timber|Glulam beams]] – created from 2×4 or 2×6 stock by gluing the faces together to create beams such as 4×12 or 6×16. As such, a beam acts as one larger piece of lumber – thus eliminating the need to harvest larger, older trees for the same size beam.
* [[Truss|Manufactured trusses]] – trusses are used in home construction as a pre-fabricated replacement for roof rafters and ceiling joists (stick-framing). It is seen as an easier installation and a better solution for supporting roofs than the use of dimensional lumber's struts and purlins as bracing. In the southern U.S. and elsewhere, stick-framing with dimensional lumber roof support is still predominant. The main drawbacks of trusses are reduced attic space, time required for engineering and ordering, and a cost higher than the dimensional lumber needed if the same project were conventionally framed. The advantages are significantly reduced labor costs (installation is faster than conventional framing), consistency, and overall schedule savings.

===Various pieces and cuts===
{{details|Woodworking}}
* Square and rectangular forms: [[Plank (wood)|Plank]], [[wikt:slat|slat]], [[batten]], [[wikt:board|board]], [[lath]], ''strapping'' (typically {{nowrap|{{frac|3|4}} in × {{frac|1|1|2}} in}}), ''cant'' (A partially sawn log such as sawn on two sides or squared to a large size and later resawn into lumber. A ''flitch'' is a type of cant with wane on one or both sides). Various pieces are also known by their uses such as [[post (structural)|post]], [[beam (structure)|beam]], ([[girt]]), [[Wall stud|stud]], [[rafter]], [[joist]], [[sill plate]], [[wall plate]].
* [[Rod (geometry)|Rod]] forms: [[Utility pole|pole]], ([[dowel]]), stick (staff, baton)

===Timber piles===
In the United States, [[piling]]s are mainly cut from [[southern yellow pine]]s and [[Douglas fir]]s. [[Wood preservation|Treated]] pilings are available in [[Chromated copper arsenate]] retentions of 0.60, 0.80 and 2.50 pounds per cubic foot ({{convert|0.60|lb/cuft|kg/m3|disp=number}}, {{convert|0.80|lb/cuft|kg/m3|disp=number}} and {{convert|2.50|lb/cuft|kg/m3|disp=out}}) if treatment is required.

==Defects in lumber==

{{Expand German|Holzfehler|date=May 2016}}

Defects occurring in lumber are grouped into the following four divisions:

===Conversion===
During the process of converting timber to commercial form the following defects may occur:
* Chip mark: this defect is indicated by the marks or signs placed by chips on the finished surface of timber
* Diagonal grain: improper sawing of timber
* Torn grain: when a small depression is made on the finished surface due to falling of some tool
* Wane: presence of original rounded surface in the finished product

===Defects due to fungi and animals===
Fungi attack timber when these conditions are all present:
* The timber moisture content is above 25% on a dry-weight basis
* The environment is sufficiently warm
* Oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is present

Wood with less than 25% moisture (dry weight basis) can remain free of decay for centuries. Similarly, wood submerged in water may not be attacked by fungi if the amount of oxygen is inadequate.

Fungi timber defects:
* [[Blue stain fungus|Blue stain]]
* [[Wood-decay fungus|Brown rot]]
* [[Dry rot]]
* [[Heart rot]]
* Sap stain
* [[Wet rot]]
* [[Wood-decay fungus#White rot|White rot]]

Following are the [[insects]] and [[molluscs]] which are usually responsible for the decay of timber:
* [[Woodboring beetle]]s
* Marine borers ([[Barnea similis]])
* Teredos ([[Teredo navalis]])
* [[Termites]]
* [[Carpenter ants]]
* [[Carpenter bee]]s

===Natural forces===
{{Main|wood warping}}
There are two main natural forces responsible for causing defects in timber: abnormal growth and rupture of tissues. Rupture of tissue includes cracks or splits in the wood called "shakes". "Ring shake", "wind shake", or "ring failure" is when the wood grain separates around the growth rings either while standing or during felling. Shakes may reduce the strength of a timber and the appearance thus reduce lumber grade and may capture moisture, promoting decay. [[Eastern hemlock]] is known for having ring shake.&lt;ref name=DA&gt;U. S. Department of Agriculture. "Shake", ''The Encyclopedia of Wood''. New York: [[Skyhorse Pub.]], 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A "check" is a crack on the surface of the wood caused by the outside of a timber shrinking as it seasons. Checks may extend to the [[pith]] and follow the grain. Like shakes, checks can hold water promoting rot. A "split" goes all the way through a timber. Checks and splits occur more frequently at the ends of lumber because of the more rapid drying in these locations.&lt;ref name=DA/&gt;

===Seasoning===
The [[Wood drying|seasoning]] of lumber is typically either kiln- or air-dried. Defects due to seasoning are the main cause of splits, bowing and honeycombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.woodworkingnetwork.com/best-practices-guide/solid-wood-machining/understanding-working-wood-defects|title=Understanding &amp; working with wood defects|last=karenkoenig|date=2016-04-04|work=Woodworking Network|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Durability and service life==
Under proper conditions, wood provides excellent, lasting performance. However, it also faces several potential threats to service life, including fungal activity and insect damage – which can be avoided in numerous ways. Section 2304.11 of the [[International Building Code]]  addresses protection against decay and termites. This section provides requirements for non-residential construction applications, such as wood used above ground (e.g., for framing, decks, stairs, etc.), as well as other applications.

There are four recommended methods to protect wood-frame structures against durability hazards and thus provide maximum service life for the building. All require proper design and construction:
* Controlling moisture using design techniques to avoid decay
* Providing effective control of termites and other insects
* Using durable materials such as pressure treated or naturally durable species of wood where appropriate
* Providing quality assurance during design and construction and throughout the building’s service life using appropriate maintenance practices

===Moisture control===
Wood is a [[Hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] material, which means it naturally absorbs and releases water to balance its internal moisture content with the surrounding environment. The moisture content of wood is measured by the weight of water as a percentage of the oven-dry weight of the wood fiber. The key to controlling decay is controlling moisture. Once decay fungi are established, the minimum moisture content for decay to propagate is 22 to 24 percent, so building experts recommend 19 percent as the maximum safe moisture content for untreated wood in service. Water by itself does not harm the wood, but rather, wood with consistently high moisture content enables fungal organisms to grow.

The primary objective when addressing moisture loads is to keep water from entering the building envelope in the first place, and to balance the moisture content within the building itself. Moisture control by means of accepted design and construction details is a simple and practical method of protecting a [[Timber framing|wood-frame building]] against decay. For applications with a high risk of staying wet, designers specify durable materials such as naturally decay-resistant species or wood that has been treated with [[preservative]]s. [[Cladding (construction)|Cladding]], [[Shake (shingle)|shingles]], [[sill plate]]s and exposed timbers or [[Glued laminated timber|glulam beams]] are examples of potential applications for treated wood.

===Controlling termites and other insects===
For buildings in termite zones, basic protection practices addressed in current building codes include (but are not limited to) the following:

• Grading the building site away from the foundation to provide proper drainage

• Covering exposed ground in any crawl spaces with 6-mil polyethylene film and maintaining at least {{convert|12|to|18|in}} of clearance between the ground and the bottom of framing members above (12&amp;nbsp;inches to beams or girders, 18&amp;nbsp;inches to joists or plank flooring members)

• Supporting post columns by concrete piers so that there is at least {{convert|6|in}} of clear space between the wood and exposed earth

• Installing wood framing and sheathing in exterior walls at least eight inches above exposed earth; locating siding at least six inches from the finished grade

• Where appropriate, ventilating crawl spaces according to local building codes

• Removing building material scraps from the job site before backfilling.

• If allowed by local regulation, treating the soil around the foundation with an approved termiticide to provide protection against subterranean termites

===Preservatives===
{{Main|Wood preservation}}
[[File:Treated timber.jpg|thumb|right|Special fasteners are used with treated lumber because of the corrosive chemicals used in its preservation process.]]

To avoid decay and termite infestation, untreated wood is separated from the ground and other sources of moisture. These separations are required by many building codes and are considered necessary to maintain wood elements in permanent structures at a safe moisture content for decay protection. When it is not possible to separate wood from the sources of moisture, designers often rely on preservative-treated wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodworks.org/files/PDF/publications/wood-design-durability-service-life-fact-sheet.pdf|title=WoodWorks Durability and Service Life|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood can be treated with a preservative that improves service life under severe conditions without altering its basic characteristics. It can also be pressure-impregnated with fire-retardant chemicals that improve its performance in a fire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA59 "Wood That Fights."] ''Popular Sciences'', March 1944, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the early treatments to "fireproof lumber", which retard fires, was developed in 1936 by the Protexol Corporation, in which lumber is heavily treated with salt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lNsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA560 "Lumber is Made Fireproof by Salt Treatment" ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1936] bottom-left p. 560&lt;/ref&gt;
Wood does not deteriorate simply because it gets wet. When wood breaks down, it is because an organism is eating it. Preservatives work by making the food source inedible to these organisms. Properly preservative-treated wood can have 5 to 10 times the service life of untreated wood. Preserved wood is used most often for railroad ties, utility poles, marine piles, decks, fences and other outdoor applications. Various treatment methods and types of chemicals are available, depending on the attributes required in the particular application and the level of protection needed.&lt;ref name="About Treated Wood - CWC"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Treated Wood|url=http://cwc.ca/design-with-wood/durability/pressure-treated-wood/about-treated-wood/|website=CWC|accessdate=May 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic methods of treating: with and without pressure. Non-pressure methods are the application of preservative by brushing, spraying or dipping the piece to be treated. Deeper, more thorough penetration is achieved by driving the preservative into the wood cells with pressure. Various combinations of pressure and vacuum are used to force adequate levels of chemical into the wood. Pressure-treating preservatives consist of chemicals carried in a solvent.
Chromated copper arsenate, once the most commonly used wood preservative in North America began being phased out of most residential applications in 2004. Replacing it are amine copper quat and copper azole.

All wood preservatives used in the United States and Canada are registered and regularly re-examined for safety by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Health Canada's Pest Management and Regulatory Agency, respectively.&lt;ref name="About Treated Wood - CWC"/&gt;

==Ancient construction works==
Timber was used as a dominant building material in most of the ancient temples of [[Kerala]] and coastal [[Karnataka]] of [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;ALAYAM : The Hindu Temple;An Epitome of Hindu Culture; G.Venkataramana Reddy;  Published by Adhyaksha; Sri Ramakrishna Math; {{ISBN|978-81-7823-542-4}}, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timber framing==
{{Main|Timber framing}}
''Timber framing'' is a style of construction which uses heavier framing elements than modern [[Framing (construction)|stick framing]], which uses dimensional lumber. The timbers originally were tree [[Bole (botany)|boles]] squared with a broadaxe or adze and joined together with joinery without nails. Modern timber framing has been growing in popularity in the United States since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Robert L.. Timber framing for the rest of us. Gabriola Island, BC: New Society Publishers, 2004. 6. Print. {{ISBN|0865715084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental effects of lumber==
Green building minimizes the impact or "environmental footprint" of a building. Wood is a major building material that is renewable and replenishable in a continuous cycle.&lt;ref name="About Treated Wood - CWC"/&gt; Studies show manufacturing wood uses less energy and results in less air and water pollution than steel and concrete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corrim.org/pubs/articles/2011/FSG_Review_Carbon_Synthesis.pdf Lippke, B., E. Oneil, R. Harrison, K. Skog, L. Gustavsson, and R. Sathre. 2011. Life cycle impacts of forest management and wood utilization on carbon mitigation: knowns and unknowns. Carbon Management 2(3): 303–33.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110121510/http://www.corrim.org/pubs/articles/2011/FSG_Review_Carbon_Synthesis.pdf |date=2011-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, demand for lumber is blamed for [[deforestation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Dauvergne]] and Jane Lister, ''[https://www.polity.co.uk/resources/peter-timber.asp Timber] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522205904/https%3A//www.polity.co.uk/resources/peter%2Dtimber.asp |date=2016-05-22 }}'' (Polity Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residual wood===
The conversion from coal to [[biomass]] power is a growing trend in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/enn.cfm#id_11950|title=EERE News: EERE Network News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Australia, Fiji, Madagascar, Mongolia, Russia, Denmark, Switzerland and Swaziland governments all support an increased role for energy derived from biomass, which are organic materials available on a renewable basis and include residues and/or byproducts of the logging, sawmilling and papermaking processes. In particular, they view it as a way to lower greenhouse gas emissions by reducing consumption of oil and gas while supporting the growth of forestry, agriculture and rural economies. Studies by the U.S. government have found the country’s combined forest and agriculture land resources have the power to sustainably supply more than one-third of its current petroleum consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feedstockreview.ornl.gov/pdf/billion_ton_vision.pdf U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Energy Biomass as a Feedstock for a Bioenergy and Bioproducts Industry: The Technical Feasibility of a Billion-Ton Annual Supply, 2005 Executive Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825173945/http://feedstockreview.ornl.gov/pdf/billion_ton_vision.pdf |date=2008-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomass is already an important source of energy for the North American forest products industry. It is common for companies to have cogeneration facilities, also known as combined heat and power, which convert some of the biomass that results from wood and paper manufacturing to electrical and thermal energy in the form of steam. The electricity is used to, among other things, dry lumber and supply heat to the dryers used in paper-making.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2477">A '''mason's mitre''' is a type of [[mitre joint]], traditionally used in [[stonework]] or [[masonry]] but commonly seen in [[Countertop#Kitchen_countertops|kitchen countertops]]. In a mason's mitre, the two elements being joined meet as for a [[butt joint]] but a small section of one member is removed creating a socket to receive the end of the other. A small mitre is made at the inside edges of the socket and on the end of the intersecting member so that edge treatments are carried through the joint appropriately.

The mason's mitre allows the appearance of a mitre joint to be created with much less waste than occurs with a common mitre joint, in which triangular sections must be removed from the ends of both joint members.

The terms "back mitre" and "mason's mitre" (or "miter") are often used interchangeably, but are different types of joints, and used for different purposes. Both joints are traditionally used in stone or woodwork. Neither joint requires that one part be [[Coping (joinery)|coped]] (or fit) over the other.  In the back mitre, the joints follow the mitre and [[stile]]/rail joining lines. In the mason's mitre, the intersecting [[Molding (process)|mouldings]] are carved within a single stone block or the woodwork's stile, with the rail or adjacent block having a straight profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frame and panel joinery *PIC*|url=http://www.woodcentral.com/woodworking/forum/archives.pl/bid/1001/md/read/id/457324/sbj/frame-and-panel-joinery/|website=www.woodcentral.com|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kitchen worktop protection== 

A protective trim for mitre cut kitchen worktops has been patented and created by Pepr products. The product is similar to aluminium trims for straight worktop joints, but shaped to fit mitre cut corner worktops. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masonsmitretrim.co.uk/|title=Re: Pepr Mason's Mitre Worktop Trim®|work=masonsmitretrim.co.uk|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faraday Laboratory 1870 Plate RGNb10333198.05.tif|thumb|Faraday's Laboratory at the Royal Institution (1870 engraving)]]

'''Michael Faraday'''  [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ær|ə|d|eɪ|,_|-|d|i}}; 22 September 1791&amp;nbsp;– 25 August 1867) was a British [[scientist]] who contributed to the study of [[electromagnetism]] and [[electrochemistry]]. His main discoveries include the principles underlying [[electromagnetic induction]], [[diamagnetism]] and [[electrolysis]].

Although Faraday received little formal education, he was one of the most influential scientists in history. It was by his research on the [[electromagnetic field|magnetic field]] around a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] carrying a [[direct current]] that Faraday established the basis for the concept of the [[electromagnetic field]] in physics. Faraday also established that [[magnetism]] could affect [[Ray (optics)|rays of light]] and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena.&lt;ref name="EncBrit"&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Faraday, Michael|volume=10|pages=173–175}}. the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEUK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theiet.org/resources/library/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm|title=Archives Michael Faraday biography – The IET|website=theiet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He similarly discovered the principles of electromagnetic induction and diamagnetism, and the [[Faraday's laws of electrolysis|laws of electrolysis]]. His [[invention]]s of [[electric motor|electromagnetic rotary devices]] formed the foundation of electric motor technology, and it was largely due to his efforts that [[electricity]] became practical for use in technology.

As a chemist, Faraday discovered [[benzene]], investigated the [[clathrate hydrate]] of chlorine, invented an early form of the [[Bunsen burner]] and the system of [[oxidation number]]s, and popularised terminology such as "[[anode]]", "[[cathode]]", "[[electrode]]" and "[[ion]]". Faraday ultimately became the first and foremost [[Fullerian Professor of Chemistry]] at the [[Royal Institution]], a lifetime position.

Faraday was an excellent experimentalist who conveyed his ideas in clear and simple language; his mathematical abilities, however, did not extend as far as [[trigonometry]] and were limited to the simplest algebra. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] took the work of Faraday and others and summarized it in a set of equations which is accepted as the basis of all modern theories of electromagnetic phenomena. On Faraday's uses of [[lines of force]], Maxwell wrote that they show Faraday "to have been in reality a mathematician of a very high order – one from whom the mathematicians of the future may derive valuable and fertile methods."&lt;ref name="MaxwellSciPapVol1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RaqhIhxqLiwC&amp;pg=PA360 The Scientific Papers of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] Volume 1] page 360; Courier Dover 2003, {{ISBN|0-486-49560-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of [[capacitance]] is named in his honour: the [[farad]].

[[Albert Einstein]] kept a picture of Faraday on his study wall, alongside pictures of [[Isaac Newton]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/11/09/1068329423959.html|title=Einstein's Heroes (book review)|last=Gleeson-White|first=Jane|date=10 November 2003|website=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist [[Ernest Rutherford]] stated, "When we consider the magnitude and extent of his discoveries and their influence on the progress of science and of industry, there is no honour too great to pay to the memory of Faraday, one of the greatest scientific discoverers of all time."&lt;ref&gt;[[C.N.R.

===Early life===

Tests Called Harmful to Pupil", New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Michael Faraday was born on 22 September 1791 in [[Newington Butts]],&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; which is now part of the [[London Borough of Southwark]] but was then a suburban part of [[Surrey]].&lt;ref&gt;For a concise account of Faraday's life including his childhood, see pages 175–83 of [[Every Saturday|EVERY SATURDAY]]: A JOURNAL OF CHOICE READING, Vol III published at Cambridge in 1873 by [[James R. Osgood|Osgood &amp; Co.]]&lt;/ref&gt;  His family was not well off. His father, James, was a member of the [[Glasite|Glassite]] sect of Christianity. James Faraday moved his wife and two children to London during the winter of 1790 from [[Outhgill]] in [[Westmorland]], where he had been an apprentice to the village blacksmith.&lt;ref&gt;The implication is that James discovered job opportunities elsewhere through membership of this sect. James joined the London meeting house on 20 February 1791, and moved his family shortly thereafter. See [[#Cantor|Cantor]], pp. 57–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael was born in the autumn of that year. The young Michael Faraday, who was the third of four children, having only the most basic school education, had to [[Autodidacticism|educate himself]].&lt;ref&gt;"Michael Faraday."  History of Science and Technology. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. [http://www.answers.com/topic/michael-faraday Answers.com 4 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 14 he became an apprentice to [[George Riebau]], a local bookbinder and bookseller in Blandford Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his seven-year apprenticeship Faraday read many books, including [[Isaac Watts]]'s ''The Improvement of the Mind'', and he enthusiastically implemented the principles and suggestions contained therein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Alice|title=Michael Faraday's Mental Exercises: An Artisan Essay-Circle in Regency London|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed an interest in science, especially in electricity. Faraday was particularly inspired by the book ''Conversations on Chemistry'' by [[Jane Marcet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

===Adult life===
[[File:Faraday Cochran Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Portrait of Faraday in his late thirties, ca. 1826]]
In 1812, at the age of 20 and at the end of his apprenticeship, Faraday attended lectures by the eminent English chemist [[Humphry Davy]] of the [[Royal Institution]] and the [[Royal Society]], and [[John Tatum (scientist)|John Tatum]], founder of the City Philosophical Society. Many of the tickets for these lectures were given to Faraday by [[William Dance]], who was one of the founders of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]]. Faraday subsequently sent Davy a 300-page book based on notes that he had taken during these lectures. Davy's reply was immediate, kind, and favourable. In 1813, when Davy damaged his eyesight in an accident with [[nitrogen trichloride]], he decided to employ Faraday as an assistant. Coincidentally one of the Royal Institution's assistants, John Payne, was sacked and Sir Humphry Davy had been asked to find a replacement; thus he appointed Faraday as Chemical Assistant at the Royal Institution on 1 March 1813.&lt;ref name="EncBrit"/&gt; Very soon Davy entrusted Faraday with the preparation of nitrogen trichloride samples, and they both were injured in an explosion of this very sensitive substance.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faraday-Millikan-Gale-1913.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.85|Michael Faraday, ca. 1861, aged about 70.]]
In the class-based English society of the time, Faraday was not considered a [[gentleman]]. When Davy set out on a long tour of the continent in 1813–15, his [[valet]] did not wish to go, so instead, Faraday went as Davy's scientific assistant and was asked to act as Davy's valet until a replacement could be found in Paris. Faraday was forced to fill the role of valet as well as assistant throughout the trip. Davy's wife, Jane Apreece, refused to treat Faraday as an equal (making him travel outside the coach, eat with the servants, etc.), and made Faraday so miserable that he contemplated returning to England alone and giving up science altogether. The trip did, however, give him access to the scientific elite of Europe and exposed him to a host of stimulating ideas.&lt;ref name="EncBrit"/&gt;

Faraday married Sarah Barnard (1800–1879) on 12 June 1821.&lt;ref&gt;The register at St. Faith-in-the-Virgin near [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], records 12 June as the date their licence was issued. The witness was Sarah's father, Edward. Their marriage was 16 years prior to the Marriage and Registration Act of 1837. See [[#Cantor|Cantor]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; They met through their families at the [[Sandemanian]] church, and he confessed his faith to the Sandemanian congregation the month after they were married. They had no children.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=9153|title=Faraday, Michael (1791–1867)|origyear=2004|year=2011|last=James|first=Frank A. J. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faraday was a devout Christian; his Sandemanian denomination was an offshoot of the [[Church of Scotland]]. Well after his marriage, he served as [[deacon]] and for two terms as an [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]] in the meeting house of his youth. His church was located at Paul's Alley in the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]]. This meeting house relocated in 1862 to [[Barnsbury]] Grove, [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]]; this North London location was where Faraday served the final two years of his second term as elder prior to his resignation from that post.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cantor|Cantor]], pp. 41–43, 60–4, and 277-80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul's Alley was located 10 houses south of the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]]. See page 330 [[James Elmes|Elmes]]'s (1831) ''Topographical Dictionary of the British Metropolis''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Biographers have noted that "a strong sense of the unity of God and nature pervaded Faraday's life and work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Baggott, Jim | title = The myth of Michael Faraday: Michael Faraday was not just one of Britain's greatest experimenters.

In June 1832, the [[University of Oxford]] granted Faraday a [[Doctor of Civil Law]] degree (honorary). During his lifetime, he was offered a [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|knighthood]] in recognition for his services to science, which he [[List of people who have declined a British honour|turned down]] on religious grounds, believing that it was against the word of the Bible to accumulate riches and pursue worldly reward, and stating that he preferred to remain "plain Mr Faraday to the end".&lt;ref&gt;West, Krista (2013).

[[File:Faraday Michael grave.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.85|Michael Faraday's grave at [[Highgate Cemetery]], London]]
Faraday suffered a nervous breakdown in 1839 but eventually returned to his investigations into electromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, Mary Ellen (1997). ''Chemical Achievers: The Human Face of the Chemical Sciences''. Chemical Heritage Foundation. {{ISBN|0-941901-12-2}}. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, as a result of representations by the [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Consort]], Faraday was awarded a [[grace and favour]] house in [[Hampton Court]] in Middlesex, free of all expenses and upkeep. This was the Master Mason's House, later called Faraday House, and now No. 37 Hampton Court Road. In 1858 Faraday retired to live there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/detail.asp?ContentID=197 Twickenham Museum on Faraday and Faraday House]; accessed 14 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having provided a number of various service projects for the British government, when asked by the government to advise on the production of chemical weapons for use in the [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856), Faraday refused to participate citing ethical reasons.&lt;ref name="Croddy"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Croddy|first1=Eric|last2=Wirtz|first2=James J.|title=Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=Faraday++chemical+weapons+Crimean+War|year=2005|pages=Page 86|isbn=978-1-85109-490-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faraday died at his house at [[Hampton Court]] on 25 August 1867, aged 75.&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|2429}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had some years before turned down an offer of burial in [[Westminster Abbey]] upon his death, but he has a memorial plaque there, near [[Isaac Newton]]'s tomb. Faraday was interred in the [[dissenters]]' (non-[[Anglicanism|Anglican]]) section of [[Highgate Cemetery]].

==Scientific achievements==
===Chemistry===
[[File:Ri 2014 - glass making - Faraday.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Equipment used by Faraday to make glass on display at the [[Royal Institution]] in London]]
Faraday's earliest chemical work was as an assistant to [[Humphry Davy]]. Faraday was specifically involved in the study of [[chlorine]]; he discovered two new compounds of chlorine and [[carbon]]. He also conducted the first rough experiments on the diffusion of gases, a phenomenon that was first pointed out by [[John Dalton]]. The physical importance of this phenomenon was more fully revealed by [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]] and [[Joseph Loschmidt]]. Faraday succeeded in liquefying several gases, investigated the alloys of steel, and produced several new kinds of glass intended for optical purposes. A specimen of one of these heavy glasses subsequently became historically important; when the glass was placed in a magnetic field Faraday determined the rotation of the plane of polarisation of light. This specimen was also the first substance found to be repelled by the poles of a magnet.

Faraday invented an early form of what was to become the [[Bunsen burner]], which is in practical use in science laboratories around the world as a convenient source of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Jensen  | first =William B. |doi=10.1021/ed082p518 | title =The Origin of the Bunsen Burner | journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education]]  | volume = 82  | issue = 4 | pages =518 | year =2005  | url = http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/HS/Journal/Issues/2005/Apr/clicSubscriber/V82N04/p518.pdf|format=PDF|bibcode = 2005JChEd..82..518J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Faraday1827|Faraday (1827)]], p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;
Faraday worked extensively in the field of chemistry, discovering chemical substances such as [[benzene]] (which he called bicarburet of hydrogen) and liquefying gases such as chlorine. The liquefying of gases helped to establish that gases are the vapours of liquids possessing a very low boiling point and gave a more solid basis to the concept of molecular aggregation. In 1820 Faraday reported the first synthesis of compounds made from carbon and chlorine, [[hexachloroethane|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[tetrachloroethylene|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], and published his results the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Faraday, Michael | title = On two new Compounds of Chlorine and Carbon, and on a new Compound of Iodine, Carbon, and Hydrogen | journal=Philosophical Transactions | year = 1821 | volume = 111| pages = 47–74 | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1821.0007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Faraday | first = Michael | title = Experimental Researches in Chemistry and Physics | publisher=[[Richard Taylor and William Francis]] | year= 1859 | location = London | pages = 33–53| isbn = 978-0-85066-841-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Williams | first = L.

Faraday was the first to report what later came to be called metallic [[nanoparticles]]. In 1847 he discovered that the optical properties of gold [[colloid]]s differed from those of the corresponding bulk metal. This was probably the first reported observation of the effects of [[quantum]] size, and might be considered to be the birth of [[nanoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nanogallery.info/nanogallery/?ipg=126 |title=The Birth of Nanotechnology |accessdate=25 July 2007 |year=2006 |publisher=Nanogallery.info |quote="Faraday made some attempt to explain what was causing the vivid coloration in his gold mixtures, saying that known phenomena seemed to indicate that a mere variation in the size of gold particles gave rise to a variety of resultant colors." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electricity and magnetism===
Faraday is best known for his work regarding electricity and magnetism. His first recorded experiment was the construction of a [[voltaic pile]] with seven [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|ha'penny]] coins, stacked together with seven disks of sheet zinc, and six pieces of paper moistened with salt water. With this pile he decomposed [[Magnesium sulfate|sulfate of magnesia]] (first letter to Abbott, 12 July 1812).
[[File:Faraday magnetic rotation.jpg|thumb|left|Electromagnetic rotation experiment of Faraday, ''ca.'' 1821&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Faraday, Michael | title = Experimental Researches in Electricity | year = 1844 | volume = 2| isbn = 978-0-486-43505-3 }} See plate 4.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1821, soon after the Danish physicist and chemist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] discovered the phenomenon of [[electromagnetism]], Davy and British scientist [[William Hyde Wollaston]] tried, but failed, to design an [[electric motor]].&lt;ref name="IEEUK"/&gt; Faraday, having discussed the problem with the two men, went on to build two devices to produce what he called "electromagnetic rotation". One of these, now known as the [[homopolar motor]], caused a continuous circular motion that was engendered by the circular magnetic force around a wire that extended into a pool of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] wherein was placed a magnet; the wire would then rotate around the magnet if supplied with current from a chemical battery. These experiments and inventions formed the foundation of modern electromagnetic technology. In his excitement, Faraday published results without acknowledging his work with either Wollaston or Davy. The resulting controversy within the [[Royal Society]] strained his mentor relationship with Davy and may well have contributed to Faraday's assignment to other activities, which consequently prevented his involvement in electromagnetic research for several years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hamilton|Hamilton]], pp. 165–71, 183, 187–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cantor|Cantor]], pp. 231–3.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Induction experiment.png|thumb|One of Faraday's 1831 experiments demonstrating induction. The liquid battery ''(right)'' sends an electric current through the small coil ''(A)''.  When it is moved in or out of the large coil ''(B)'', its magnetic field induces a momentary voltage in the coil, which is detected by the galvanometer ''(G)''.]]
From his initial discovery in 1821, Faraday continued his laboratory work, exploring electromagnetic properties of materials and developing requisite experience. In 1824, Faraday briefly set up a circuit to study whether a magnetic field could regulate the flow of a current in an adjacent wire, but he found no such relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thompson|Thompson]], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment followed similar work conducted with light and magnets three years earlier that yielded identical results.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thompson|Thompson]], p. 91. This lab entry illustrates Faraday's quest for the connection between light and electromagnetic phenomenon 10 September 1821.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cantor|Cantor]], p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; During the next seven years, Faraday spent much of his time perfecting his recipe for optical quality (heavy) glass, borosilicate of lead,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thompson|Thompson]], pp. 95–98.&lt;/ref&gt; which he used in his future studies connecting light with magnetism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thompson|Thompson]], p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his spare time, Faraday continued publishing his experimental work on optics and electromagnetism; he conducted correspondence with scientists whom he had met on his journeys across Europe with Davy, and who were also working on electromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;Faraday's initial induction lab work occurred in late November 1825. His work was heavily influenced by the ongoing research of fellow European scientists Ampere, Arago, and Oersted as indicated by his diary entries. [[#Cantor|Cantor]], pp. 235–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years after the death of Davy, in 1831, he began his great series of experiments in which he discovered [[electromagnetic induction]], recording in his laboratory diary on 28 October 1831 he was; "making many experiments with the great magnet of the Royal Society".&lt;ref&gt;Gooding, David; Pinch, Trevor; Schaffer, Simon (1989).

[[File:Faraday emf experiment.svg|thumb|A diagram of Faraday's iron ring-coil apparatus]]

[[File:Faraday disk generator.jpg|thumb|left|Built in 1831, the [[Faraday disk]] was the first [[electric generator]]. The horseshoe-shaped magnet ''(A)'' created a magnetic field through the disk ''(D)''. When the disk was turned, this induced an electric current radially outward from the center toward the rim.  The current flowed out through the sliding spring contact ''m'', through the external circuit, and back into the center of the disk through the axle.]]
Faraday's breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around an iron ring, and found that upon passing a current through one coil a momentary current was induced in the other coil.&lt;ref name="IEEUK"/&gt; This phenomenon is now known as [[mutual induction]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Valkenburgh (1995). ''Basic Electricity''. Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|0-7906-1041-8}}. p.&amp;nbsp;4–91.&lt;/ref&gt; The iron ring-coil apparatus is still on display at the Royal Institution. In subsequent experiments, he found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire an electric current flowed in that wire. The current also flowed if the loop was moved over a stationary magnet. His demonstrations established that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field; this relation was modelled mathematically by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] as [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], which subsequently became one of the four [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell equations]], and which have in turn evolved into the generalization known today as [[Field theory (physics)|field theory]].&lt;ref name="Pioneers"/&gt; Faraday would later use the principles he had discovered to construct the electric [[Electrical generator#Dynamo|dynamo]], the ancestor of modern power generators and the electric motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michael Faraday's generator|url=http://www.rigb.org/our-history/iconic-objects/iconic-objects-list/faraday-generator|publisher=The Royal Institution|date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Faraday and Daniell 1849 RGNb10408769 f85.tif|thumb|right|Faraday ([[relative direction|right]]) and [[John Frederic Daniell|John Daniell]] ([[relative direction|left]]), founders of electrochemistry.]]
In 1832, he completed a series of experiments aimed at investigating the fundamental nature of electricity; Faraday used "[[Electrostatics|static]]", [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], and "[[Bioelectromagnetism|animal electricity]]" to produce the phenomena of electrostatic attraction, [[electrolysis]], [[Electromagnetism|magnetism]], etc. He concluded that, contrary to the scientific opinion of the time, the divisions between the various "kinds" of electricity were illusory. Faraday instead proposed that only a single "electricity" exists, and the changing values of quantity and intensity (current and voltage) would produce different groups of phenomena.&lt;ref name="IEEUK"/&gt;

Near the end of his career, Faraday proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor.&lt;ref name="Pioneers"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lives and Times of Great Pioneers in Chemistry (lavoisier to Sanger)|date=2015|publisher=World Scientific|pages=85, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was rejected by his fellow scientists, and Faraday did not live to see the eventual acceptance of his proposition by the scientific community. Faraday's concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields; that conceptual model was crucial for the successful development of the electromechanical devices that dominated engineering and industry for the remainder of the 19th century.

===Diamagnetism===
[[File:Faraday photograph ii.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Faraday holding a type of glass bar he used in 1845 to show magnetism affects light in [[dielectric]] material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detail of an engraving by Henry Adlard, based on earlier photograph by Maull &amp; Polyblank ''ca.'' 1857|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp01529|publisher=[[NPR]]|location=National Portrait Gallery, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1845, Faraday discovered that many materials exhibit a weak repulsion from a magnetic field: a phenomenon he termed [[diamagnetism]].&lt;ref&gt;James, Frank A.J.L (2010). ''Michael Faraday: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-161446-7}}. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Faraday also discovered that the plane of [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of linearly polarized light can be rotated by the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the direction in which the light is moving. This is now termed the [[Faraday effect]].&lt;ref name="Pioneers"/&gt; In Sept 1845 he wrote in his notebook, "I have at last succeeded in ''illuminating a magnetic curve'' or ''[[line of force]]'' and in ''magnetising a [[Ray (optics)|ray of light]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Day, Peter (1999). ''The Philosopher's Tree: A Selection of Michael Faraday's Writings''. CRC Press. {{ISBN|0-7503-0570-3}}. p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on in his life, in 1862, Faraday used a spectroscope to search for a different alteration of light, the change of spectral lines by an applied magnetic field. The equipment available to him was, however, insufficient for a definite determination of spectral change. [[Pieter Zeeman]] later used an improved apparatus to study the same phenomenon, publishing his results in 1897 and receiving the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics for his success. In both his 1897 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = The Effect of Magnetisation on the Nature of Light Emitted by a Substance | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]  | year = 1897 | volume = 55 | pages = 347 | author=Zeeman, Pieter | doi = 10.1038/055347a0|bibcode = 1897Natur..55..347Z | issue=1424}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his Nobel acceptance speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Pieter Zeeman, Nobel Lecture | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1902/zeeman-lecture.html | accessdate =29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeeman made reference to Faraday's work.

===Faraday cage===
In his work on static electricity, [[Faraday's ice pail experiment]] demonstrated that the charge resided only on the exterior of a charged conductor, and exterior charge had no influence on anything enclosed within a conductor. This is because the exterior charges redistribute such that the interior fields emanating from them cancel one another. This shielding effect is used in what is now known as a [[Faraday cage]].&lt;ref name="Pioneers"/&gt;

==Royal Institution and public service==
[[File:FaradayFatherThames.jpg|thumb|Michael Faraday meets [[Father Thames]], from ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' (21 July 1855)]]

Faraday had a long association with the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]].  He was appointed Assistant Superintendent of the House of the Royal Institution in 1821.&lt;ref name=RIBiography&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Faraday (1791–1867)|url=http://www.rigb.org/our-history/people/f/michael-faraday|publisher=The Royal Institution|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected a member of the [[Royal Society]] in 1824.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; In 1825, he became Director of the Laboratory of the Royal Institution.&lt;ref name=RIBiography /&gt;  Six years later, in 1833, Faraday became the first [[Fullerian Professor of Chemistry]] at the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]], a position to which he was appointed for life without the obligation to deliver lectures. His sponsor and mentor was [[John 'Mad Jack' Fuller]], who created the position at the Royal Institution for Faraday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Roger|title=What's Who?: A Dictionary of Things Named After People and the People They are Named After|date=2009|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond his scientific research into areas such as chemistry, electricity, and magnetism at the [[Royal Institution]], Faraday undertook numerous, and often time-consuming, service projects for private enterprise and the British government. This work included investigations of explosions in coal mines, being an [[expert witness]] in court, and along with two engineers from [[Chance Brothers]] c.1853, the preparation of high-quality optical glass, which was required by Chance for its lighthouses. In 1846, together with [[Charles Lyell]], he produced a lengthy and detailed report on a serious [[explosion]] in the colliery at [[Haswell, County Durham]], which killed 95 miners. Their report was a meticulous [[forensic investigation]] and indicated that [[coal dust]] contributed to the severity of the explosion. The report should have warned coal owners of the hazard of coal dust explosions, but the risk was ignored for over 60 years until the [[Senghenydd Colliery Disaster]] of 1913.
[[File:Lighthouse lantern room with Fresnel lens.png|thumb|left|Lighthouse lantern room from mid-1800s]]
As a respected scientist in a nation with strong maritime interests, Faraday spent extensive amounts of time on projects such as the construction and operation of [[lighthouse]]s and protecting the bottoms of ships from [[corrosion]]. His workshop still stands at [[Trinity Buoy Wharf]] above the Chain and Buoy Store, next to London's only lighthouse where he carried out the first experiments in electric lighting for lighthouses.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Denis (2001). ''London and the Thames Valley''. Thomas Telford. {{ISBN|0-7277-2876-8}}. p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Faraday was also active in what would now be called [[environmental science]], or engineering. He investigated industrial pollution at [[Swansea]] and was consulted on air pollution at the [[Royal Mint]]. In July 1855, Faraday wrote a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' on the subject of the foul condition of the [[River Thames]], which resulted in an often-reprinted cartoon in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. (See also [[The Great Stink]]).&lt;ref&gt;Faraday, Michael (9 July 1855). "The State of the Thames". The Times. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Faraday assisted with the planning and judging of exhibits for the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851 in London. He also advised the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] on the cleaning and protection of its art collection, and served on the National Gallery Site Commission in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21950|page=4219|date=16 December 1856}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Education was another of Faraday's areas of service; he lectured on the topic in 1854 at the Royal Institution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/scienceeducation00roya|title=Science and education; lectures delivered at the Royal institution of Great Britain|last=Royal Institution of Great Britain|first=|last2=Whewell|first2=William|last3=Faraday|first3=Michael|last4=Latham|first4=Robert Gordon|last5=Daubeny|first5=Charles|last6=Tyndall|first6=John|last7=Paget|first7=James|last8=Hodgson|first8=William Ballantyne|last9=Lankester|first9=E.

Faraday also weighed in negatively on the public's fascination with [[table-turning]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 2 July 1853, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?q1=faraday;id=chi.60765664;view=1up;seq=526;start=1;sz=10;page=search;num=530#view=1up;seq=526 p.530] for Faraday's comments.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924012323014|title=Michael Faraday; his life and work|last=Thompson|first=Silvanus Phillips|date=1898|publisher=London, Cassell|others=Cornell University Library|isbn=|location=|pages=250–252|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mesmerism]], and [[seance]]s, and in so doing chastised both the public and the nation's educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FH0bc2VJNe4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The correspondence of Michael Faraday.

[[File:Faraday Michael Christmas lecture.jpg|thumb|Michael Faraday delivering a [[Christmas Lecture]] at the [[Royal Institution]] in 1856.]]

Before his famous Christmas lectures, Faraday delivered chemistry lectures for the City Philosophical Society from 1816 to 1818 in order to refine the quality of his lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1119/1.1343427| title = Michael Faraday: Prince of lecturers in Victorian England| journal = The Physics Teacher| volume = 39| issue = 1| pages = 32–36| year = 2001| last1 = Lan | first1 = B. L. |bibcode = 2001PhTea..39...32L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1827 and 1860 at the [[Royal Institution]] in London, Faraday gave a series of nineteen [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Christmas lectures]] for young people, a series which continues today. The objective of Faraday's Christmas lectures was to present science to the general public in the hopes of inspiring them and generating revenue for the Royal Institution. They were notable events on the social calendar among London's gentry. Over the course of several letters to his close friend Benjamin Abbott, Faraday outlined his recommendations on the art of lecturing: Faraday wrote "a flame should be lighted at the commencement and kept alive with unremitting splendour to the end".&lt;ref&gt;Hirshfeld, Alan (2006). ''The Electric Life of Michael Faraday''. New York: Walker &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-8027-1470-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lectures were joyful and juvenile, he delighted in filling soap bubbles with various gasses (in order to determine whether or not they are magnetic) in front of his audiences and marveled at the rich colors of polarized lights, but the lectures were also deeply philosophical. In his lectures he urged his audiences to consider the mechanics of his experiments: "you know very well that ice floats upon water&amp;nbsp;... Why does the ice float? Think of that, and philosophise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.3035100| title = Michael Faraday and the Art of Lecturing| journal = Physics Today| volume = 21| issue = 8| pages = 30–38| year = 1968| last1 = Seeger | first1 = R.

[[File:Michael Faraday statue AB.jpg|thumb|Michael Faraday statue in [[Savoy Place]], London. Sculptor [[John Henry Foley]] RA.]]

A statue of Faraday stands in [[Savoy Place]], London, outside the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]]. Also in London, the [[Michael Faraday Memorial]], designed by [[brutalist]] architect [[Rodney Gordon]] and completed in 1961, is at the [[Elephant &amp; Castle]] gyratory system, near Faraday's birthplace at [[Newington Butts]]. Faraday School is located on [[Trinity Buoy Wharf]] where his workshop still stands above the Chain and Buoy Store, next to London's only lighthouse.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Stuart (2012). ''Rivers of Britain: Estuaries, tideways, havens, lochs, firths and kyles''. [[A&amp;C Black]]. {{ISBN|1-4081-5583-4}}. p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Faraday Gardens is a small park in [[Walworth]], London, not far from his birthplace at [[Newington Butts]]. This park lies within the local council ward of Faraday in the [[London Borough of Southwark]]. Michael Faraday Primary school is situated on the [[Aylesbury Estate]] in [[Walworth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelfaradayschool.co.uk/about_us/ Michael Faraday Primary School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329005025/http://michaelfaradayschool.co.uk/about_us/ |date=29 March 2012 }}. michaelfaradayschool.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

A building at [[London South Bank University]], which houses the institute's electrical engineering departments is named the Faraday Wing, due to its proximity to Faraday's birthplace in [[Newington Butts]]. A hall at [[Loughborough University]] was named after Faraday in 1960. Near the entrance to its dining hall is a bronze casting, which depicts the symbol of an electrical [[transformer]], and inside there hangs a portrait, both in Faraday's honour. An eight-story building at the [[University of Edinburgh]]'s science &amp; engineering campus is named for Faraday, as is a recently built hall of accommodation at [[Brunel University]], the main engineering building at [[Swansea University]], and the instructional and experimental physics building at [[Northern Illinois University]]. The former UK Faraday Station in [[Antarctica]] was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_bas/our_history/stations_and_refuges/faraday.php Faraday Station F — History]. antarctica.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

Streets named for Faraday can be found in many British cities (e.g., London, [[Fife]], [[Swindon]], [[Basingstoke]], [[Nottingham]], [[Whitby]], [[Kirkby]], [[Crawley]], [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], [[Swansea]], [[Aylesbury]] and [[Stevenage]]) as well as in France (Paris), Germany ([[Berlin]]-[[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]], Hermsdorf), Canada (Quebec; [[Deep River, Ontario]]; Ottawa, Ontario), and the United States ([[Reston, Virginia]]).

A [[Royal Society of Arts]] [[blue plaque]], unveiled in 1876, commemorates Faraday at 48 Blandford Street in London's Marylebone district.&lt;ref name='EngHet'&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/faraday-michael-1791-1867|title=FARADAY, MICHAEL (1791–1867)|publisher=[[English Heritage]]| accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1991 until 2001, Faraday's picture featured on the reverse of Series E £20 [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|banknotes]] issued by the [[Bank of England note issues|Bank of England]]. He was portrayed conducting a lecture at the Royal Institution with the magneto-electric spark apparatus.&lt;ref name="bankofengland"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/denom_guide/index.htm|title=Withdrawn banknotes reference guide|publisher=[[Bank of England]]|accessdate=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Faraday was ranked number 22 in the [[BBC]]'s list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]] following a UK-wide vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/greatbritons/list.shtml/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021204214727/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/greatbritons/list.shtml/|archivedate=2002-12-04|title=BBC – Great Britons – Top 100|website=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Faraday Institute for Science and Religion]] derives its name from the scientist, who saw his faith as integral to his scientific research. The logo of the Institute is also based on Faraday's discoveries. It was created in 2006 by a $2,000,000 [[Grant (money)|grant]] from the [[John Templeton Foundation]] to carry out academic research, to foster understanding of the interaction between science and religion, and to engage public understanding in both these subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templeton.org/what-we-fund/grants/faraday-institute-for-science-and-religion-interdisciplinary-research-and-projec|title=Faraday Institute for Science and Religion: Interdisciplinary Research and Projects|website=templeton.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111173539/http://www.templeton.org/what-we-fund/grants/faraday-institute-for-science-and-religion-interdisciplinary-research-and-projec|archivedate=11 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/Institute.php About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213214256/http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/Institute.php |date=13 December 2009 }}, Faraday Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

Faraday's life and contributions to electromagnetics was the principal topic of the tenth episode, titled "[[The Electric Boy]]", of the 2014 American science documentary series, ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'', which was broadcast on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and the [[National Geographic Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=A Successor to Sagan Reboots 'Cosmos' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/science/space/a-successor-to-sagan-reboots-cosmos.html |date=4 March 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=17 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics''' ('''MOA''') is a collaborative project between researchers in [[New Zealand]] and [[Japan]], led by Professor Yasushi Muraki of [[Nagoya University]]. They use [[gravitational microlensing|microlensing]] to observe [[dark matter]], [[exoplanet|extra-solar planets]], and [[stellar atmosphere]]s from the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The group concentrates especially on the detection and observation of [[gravitational microlensing]] events of high magnification, of order 100 or more, as these provide the greatest sensitivity to extrasolar planets. They work with other groups in [[Australia]], the [[United States]] and elsewhere. Observations are conducted at New Zealand's [[Mount John University Observatory|Mt. John University Observatory]] using a {{convert|1.8|m|in|1|abbr=on}} [[reflector telescope]] built for the project.

The '''Monolith of Silwan''', also known as the '''Tomb of Pharaoh's daughter''' is a cuboid [[Rock-cut tombs|rock-cut tomb]] located in [[Silwan]], [[Jerusalem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/map/collection/p15799coll74|title=The West Bank and East Jerusalem Searchable Map|publisher=USC Digital Library [[University of Southern California]]|accessdate=2013-10-28|at=Silwan}}&lt;/ref&gt; dating from the period of the [[Kingdom of Judah]]; the latter name refers to a 19th-century hypothesis that the tomb was built by [[Solomon]] for his [[Egypt]]ian wife.&lt;ref name=Ussishkin-TAU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/archaeology/projects/proj_past_silwan.html |title=Silwan, Jerusalem: The Survey of the Iron Age Necropolis |last1=Ussishkin |first1=David |publisher=Tel Aviv University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529130818/http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/archaeology/projects/proj_past_silwan.html |archivedate=May 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ussishkin-ASOR&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.academia.edu/3148025/The_Necropolis_from_the_Time_of_the_Kingdom_of_Judah_at_Silwan_Jerusalem |title=The Necropolis from the Time of the Kingdom of Judah at Silwan, Jerusalem |last1=Ussishkin|first1=David|accessdate=2013-10-28|pages=42&amp;ndash;44|date=May 1970|publisher=American Schools of Oriental Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure, a typical [[Rock-cut tombs in Israel|Israelite rock-cut tomb]], was previously capped by a pyramid structure like the [[Tomb of Zechariah]].  It is one of the more complete and distinctive First Temple Period structures. The pyramidal, rock cap was cut into pieces and removed for quarry,&lt;ref name="holyland"&gt;[[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]], ''The Holy Land'', (2008), page 118&lt;/ref&gt; during the Roman era leaving a flat roof.&lt;ref name="winter"&gt;Dave Winter, ''Israel handbook'', page 174&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb contains a single stone bench, indicating that it was designed for only one burial.&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Daniel Jacobs, ''Rough Guide to Jerusalem'' (1999), page 114&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research indicates that the bench was the base of a [[sarcophagus]] hewn into the original building.&lt;ref name="BAR-39-1"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Who Was Buried in the Tomb of Pharaoh's Daughter? | author=Barkay, Gabriel | journal=Biblical Archaeology Review |date=January–February 2013 | volume=39 | issue=1 | pages=41–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pharaoh's daughter tradition was first suggested by [[Louis Felicien de Saulcy|Louis Félicien de Saulcy]],&lt;ref name="holyland" /&gt; who noted that the bible claims that Solomon built a temple for his Egyptian wife;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|3:1|}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Saulcy, excavating the site in the 19th century, suggested that this might be the same building.&lt;ref name="holyland" /&gt; However, subsequent archaeological investigation has dated the site to the 9th-7th Century BC,&lt;ref name="jacobs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avigao, (1954)&lt;/ref&gt; making the connection to Solomon impossible.

Two letters of a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] inscription survive on the building, the remainder of the inscription having been mutilated beyond recognition, by a [[hermit]] in the [[Byzantine]] era;&lt;ref name="winter" /&gt; Byzantine monks increased the height of the low entrance by removing rock which contained the inscription in order to ease access to the tomb, in which they resided.&lt;ref name="winter" /&gt; The tomb was cleaned following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].

'''Natural Gas Choice''' programs in [[United States of America]] allow residential consumers and other small volume gas users to purchase [[natural gas]] from someone other than their traditional [[utility company]].  With Natural Gas Choice programs, customers can either purchase from their natural gas utility or choose to receive their gas supply from non-utility Choice suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/natural_gas/restructure/restructure.html |title=Natural Gas Residential Choice Programs |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date=2010-05-17 |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large commercial and industrial consumers have had the option of purchasing the natural gas commodity separately from natural gas services for many years.  
&lt;ref name="eia.doe.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/natural_gas/restructure/state/us.html |title=Retail Unbundling - U.S. Summary |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural Gas Choice==

===Overview===
Currently, 21 States and the District of Columbia have legislation or existing programs that allow Natural Gas Choice Programs. Enrollment in “customer choice” programs increased in 2008 for the third year in a row.  Overall, more than 13 percent or about 4.7 million of the approximately 35 million residential natural gas consumers with access to choice were buying natural gas from marketers as of December 2008. The availability and characteristics of these customer choice programs vary widely from state to state.  For instance, some states allow customers to participate in Choice programs, but lack of natural gas supplier participation has precluded the development of a competitive natural gas market. Even in fully developed competitive markets enrollment varies widely. Currently the states of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Ohio]] have the highest percentage of customer participation in Natural Gas Choice programs with 81.5 percent and 42.3 percent of customers participating in Natural Gas Choice Programs respectively.&lt;ref name="eia.doe.gov"/&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]], on the other hand, have customer participation rates of 17.1 percent and 3.1 percent respectively, despite full implementation of Natural Gas Choice Programs.&lt;ref name="eia.doe.gov/newyork"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/oil_gas/natural_gas/restructure/state/ny.html |title=Retail Unbundling - New York |publisher=Eia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the disparity between participation rates is the difficulty marketers in some states have obtaining [[Financing Energy Remarketers|financing]] to purchase natural gas for delivery. Whereas in Georgia, the overwhelming majority of customers are served by one large marketer, [[Georgia Natural Gas]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/oil_gas/natural_gas/restructure/state/ga.html |title=Retail Unbundling - Georgia |publisher=Eia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; a wholly owned subsidiary of the regulated utility, [[Atlanta Gas Light Company]]. New York State is served by 69 mostly independent marketers.&lt;ref name="eia.doe.gov/newyork"/&gt;

===Georgia===
Georgia is the state with the highest participation percentage in Natural Gas Choice programs.&lt;ref name="eia.doe.gov"/&gt;  In 1999 all Georgia customers became eligible to participate in Natural Gas Choice. At one time 19 natural gas suppliers were approved to supply gas to natural gas customers. However, by 2002, 90% of Georgia residents were served by 3 or fewer marketers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In 2007, Georgia had 1,793,650 residential and 127,835 commercial customers. They consumed approximately 112 and 49 billion cubic feet of natural gas, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/natural_gas/restructure/state/ga.html |title=Retail Unbundling - Georgia |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ohio===
Ohio has had Natural Gas Choice since 1997.  More than 40 percent of the state's residential natural gas customers were participating in choice programs as of September 2008.  Several major Ohio natural gas utilities in Ohio have plans to exit the function of supplying natural gas to customers, leaving the gas supply function to independent natural gas supply companies.   In 2007, Ohio had 3,273,791 residential, 272,548 commercial, and 6,865 industrial customers. They consumed approximately 300, 159, and 295 billion cubic feet of natural gas, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/natural_gas/restructure/state/oh.html |title=Retail Unbundling - Ohio |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Ohio has 35 natural gas suppliers certified to participate in Natural Gas Choice programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puco.ohio.gov/apps/RegulatedCompanyList/index.cfm?IID=11 |title=Regulated company list - PUCO |publisher=Puco.ohio.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuclear warfare''' (sometimes '''atomic warfare''' or '''thermonuclear warfare''') is a [[military conflict]] or [[political strategy]] in which [[nuclear weapon]]ry is used to inflict damage on the enemy.  Nuclear weapons are [[weapons of mass destruction]]; in contrast to [[conventional warfare]], nuclear warfare can produce destruction in a much shorter time and can have a long-lasting [[radiological warfare]] result. A major nuclear exchange would have long-term effects, primarily from the [[fallout]] released, and could also lead to a "[[nuclear winter]]" that could last for decades, centuries, or even millennia after the initial attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=940&amp;page=155|title=7 Possible Toxic Environments Following a Nuclear War – The Medical Implications of Nuclear War 1985 – The National Academies Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9056451/nuclear-winter|title=nuclear winter|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts [[Nuclear winter#Criticism and debate|dismiss the nuclear winter hypothesis]], and calculate that even with nuclear weapon stockpiles at [[Cold War]] highs, although there would be [[1,000,000,000|billions]] of [[Casualty (person)|casualties]], billions more rural people would nevertheless survive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Brian|date=December 1982|title=The global health effects of nuclear war|url=http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/82cab/index.html|journal=Current Affairs Bulletin|volume=59|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bmartin.cc"&gt;[http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/82jpr.html Critique of Nuclear Extinction – Brian Martin 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="johnstonsarchive.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/nuclearwar1.html|title=The Effects of a Global Thermonuclear War|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21437545?selectedversion=NBD238850 Long-term worldwide effects of multiple nuclear-weapons detonations.

So far, [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|two nuclear weapons]] have been used in the course of [[war]]fare, both by the [[United States]] near the end of [[World War II]]. On August 6, 1945, a [[uranium]] [[Nuclear weapon design|gun-type]] device (code name "[[Little Boy]]") was detonated over the [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]ese city of [[Hiroshima]]. Three days later, on August 9, a [[plutonium]] [[Nuclear weapon design|implosion-type]] device (code name "[[Fat Man]]") was detonated over the Japanese city of [[Nagasaki]]. These two bombings resulted in the deaths of approximately 120,000 people.

After World War II, nuclear weapons were also developed by the [[Soviet atomic bomb project|Soviet Union]] (1949), the [[United Kingdom]] (1952), [[France]] (1960), and the [[People's Republic of China]] (1964), which contributed to the state of conflict and extreme tension that became known as the [[Cold War]]. In 1974, [[India]], and in 1998, [[Pakistan]], two countries that were openly hostile toward each other, developed nuclear weapons. [[Israel]] (1960s) and [[North Korea]] (2006) are also thought to have developed stocks of nuclear weapons, though it is not known how many. The Israeli government has never admitted or denied to having nuclear weapons, although it is known to have constructed the reactor and reprocessing plant necessary for building nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hersh|first1=Seymour|title=The Samson Option|date=1991|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-394-57006-5|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Africa]] also manufactured several complete nuclear weapons in the 1980s, but subsequently became [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|the first country to voluntarily destroy their domestically made weapons stocks]] and abandon further production (1990s).&lt;ref name='GlobSec1'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/rsa/nuke.htm|title=Nuclear Weapons Program|author=John Pike|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear weapons have been detonated on over 2,000 occasions for [[nuclear weapons testing|testing purposes]] and demonstrations.&lt;ref name='1945-1998'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctbto.org/specials/1945-1998-by-isao-hashimoto/|title="1945–1998" by Isao Hashimoto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Tally'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/nucleartesttally|title=The Nuclear Testing Tally – Arms Control Association|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 and the resultant end of the Cold War, the threat of a major nuclear war between the [[superpower|two nuclear superpowers]] was generally thought to have declined. Since then, concern over nuclear weapons has shifted to the prevention of localized nuclear conflicts resulting from [[nuclear proliferation]], and the threat of [[nuclear terrorism]].

==Types of nuclear warfare==
The possibility of using nuclear weapons in war is usually divided into two subgroups, each with different effects and potentially fought with different types of nuclear armaments.

The first, a '''limited nuclear war'''&lt;ref name=" N.N. Sokov "&gt;{{cite book |url=http://thebulletin.org/why-russia-calls-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation |author=N.N. Sokov  |title=Why Russia calls a limited nuclear strike "de-escalation" |publisher=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=2015 |isbn= |page=|accessdate=2015-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes ''attack'' or ''exchange''), refers to a small-scale use of nuclear weapons by two (or more) belligerents. A "limited nuclear war" could include targeting military facilities—either as an attempt to [[pre-emptive nuclear strike|pre-emptively]] cripple the enemy's ability to attack as a defensive measure, or as a prelude to an invasion by conventional forces, as an offensive measure. This term could apply to ''any'' small-scale use of nuclear weapons that may involve military or civilian targets (or both). {{Dubious|date=April 2012}}{{According to whom|date=April 2012}}

The second, a '''full-scale nuclear war''', could consist of large numbers of nuclear weapons used in an attack aimed at an entire country, including military, economic, and civilian targets. Such an attack would almost certainly destroy the entire economic, social, and military infrastructure of the target nation, and would probably have a devastating effect on Earth's biosphere.&lt;ref name=Ehrlich/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grover|first=Herbert D.|last2=Harwell|first2=Mark A.|date=1985-10-01|title=Biological Effects of Nuclear War II: Impact on the Biosphere|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-lookup/doi/10.2307/1309966|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=35|issue=9|pages=576–583|doi=10.2307/1309966|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Cold War]] strategists such as [[Henry Kissinger]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/multimedia/video/2008/wallace/kissinger_henry_t.html|title=Henry Kissinger: The Mike Wallace Interview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that a limited nuclear war could be possible between two heavily armed superpowers (such as the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]). Some predict, however, that a limited war could potentially "[[Conflict escalation|escalate]]" into a full-scale nuclear war. Others{{Who|date=April 2012}} have called limited nuclear war "global nuclear holocaust in slow motion", arguing that—once such a war took place—others would be sure to follow over a period of decades, effectively rendering the planet uninhabitable in the same way that a "full-scale nuclear war" between superpowers would, only taking a much longer (and arguably more agonizing) path to the same result.

Even the most optimistic predictions{{by whom|date=September 2012}} of the effects of a major nuclear exchange foresee the death of many millions of victims within a very short period of time. More pessimistic predictions argue that a full-scale nuclear war could potentially bring about the [[human extinction|extinction of the human race]], or at least its ''near'' extinction, with only a relatively small number of survivors (mainly in remote areas) and a reduced [[quality of life]] and [[life expectancy]] for centuries afterward. However, such predictions, assuming [[total war]] with nuclear arsenals at [[Cold war|Cold War]] highs, have not been without criticism.&lt;ref name="bmartin.cc"/&gt; Such a horrific catastrophe as global nuclear warfare would almost certainly cause permanent damage to most complex life on the planet, its ecosystems, and the global climate. If predictions about the production of a [[nuclear winter]] are accurate, it would also change the balance of global power, with countries such as Australia, New Zealand, India, China, Argentina and Brazil predicted to become world superpowers if the Cold War ever led to a large-scale nuclear attack.&lt;ref name="johnstonsarchive.net"/&gt;

A study presented at the annual meeting of the [[American Geophysical Union]] in December 2006 asserted that even a small-scale regional nuclear war could produce as many direct fatalities as all of [[World War II]] and disrupt the global climate for a decade or more. In a regional nuclear conflict scenario in which two opposing nations in the [[subtropics]] each used 50 Hiroshima-sized nuclear weapons (c. 15 kiloton each) on major population centers, the researchers predicted fatalities ranging from 2.6 million to 16.7 million per country. The authors of the study estimated that as much as five million tons of [[soot]] could be released, producing a cooling of several degrees over large areas of North America and [[Eurasia]] (including most of the grain-growing regions). The cooling would last for years and could be "catastrophic", according to the researchers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/12/061211090729.htm ScienceDaily – Regional Nuclear War Could Devastate Global Climate]&lt;/ref&gt;

Either a limited or full-scale nuclear exchange could occur during an ''accidental nuclear war'', in which the use of nuclear weapons is triggered unintentionally. Postulated triggers for this scenario have included malfunctioning early warning devices and/or targeting computers, deliberate malfeasance by rogue military commanders, consequences of an accidental straying of warplanes into enemy airspace, reactions to unannounced missile tests during tense diplomatic periods, reactions to military exercises, mistranslated or miscommunicated messages, and others. A number of these scenarios actually occurred during the Cold War, though none resulted in the use of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Alan F. Philips, [http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/accidents/20-mishaps-maybe-caused-nuclear-war.htm 20 Mishaps That Might Have Started Accidental Nuclear War].&lt;/ref&gt; Many such scenarios have been depicted in [[nuclear weapons in popular culture|popular culture]], such as in the 1959 film [[On the Beach (1959 film)|''On the Beach]], the 1962 novel ''[[Fail-Safe (novel)|Fail-Safe]]'' (released as a film in 1964); the film ''[[WarGames]]'', released in 1983; and the film ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'', also released in 1964.

====Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki====
{{Main|Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki}}[[Image:Nagasakibomb.jpg|thumb|Mushroom cloud from the atomic explosion over Nagasaki rising {{convert|18000|m|ft|abbr=on}} into the air on the morning of August 9, 1945.]]

During the final stages of [[World War II]] in 1945, the United States conducted atomic raids on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the first on August 6, 1945, and the second on August 9, 1945. These two events were the only times nuclear weapons have been used in [[combat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hakim| first = Joy| title = A History of Us: War, Peace and all that Jazz| publisher=Oxford University Press| year = 1995| location = New York| isbn = 0-19-509514-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For six months before the atomic bombings, the U.S. [[Twentieth Air Force|20th Air Force]] under [[General (United States)|General]] [[Curtis LeMay]] executed low-level [[Firebombing|incendiary raids]] [[Air raids on Japan|against Japanese cities]]. The worst air raid to occur during the process was not the nuclear attacks, but the [[Bombing of Tokyo|''Operation Meetinghouse'' raid on Tokyo]]. On the night of March 9–10, 1945, ''Operation Meetinghouse'' commenced and 334 [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] [[bomber]]s took off to raid, with 279 of them dropping 1,665 tons of [[incendiary bombs|incendiaries]] and [[explosive]]s on Tokyo. The bombing was meant to burn wooden buildings and indeed the bombing caused fire that created a 50&amp;nbsp;m/s wind, which is comparable to tornadoes. Each bomber carried 6 tons of bombs. A total of 381,300 bombs, which amount to 1,783 tons of bombs, were used in the bombing. Within a few hours of the raid, it had killed an estimated 100,000 people and destroyed {{convert|41|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of the city and 267,000 buildings in a single night — the deadliest bombing raid in [[military aviation]] history other than the atomic raids on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0310-08.htm|title=1945 Tokyo Firebombing Left Legacy of Terror, Pain|work=Common Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2011/03/0309incendiary-bombs-kill-100000-tokyo/ |title=March 9, 1945: Burning the Heart Out of the Enemy |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=9 March 2011 |website=Wired |publisher=Condé Nast Digital |accessdate=June 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolk (2010), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/firebombing-of-tokyo|title=Firebombing of Tokyo|work=HISTORY.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early August 1945, an estimated 450,000 people had died as the U.S. had intensely firebombed a total of 67 Japanese cities.

In late June 1945, as the U.S. wrapped up the two-and-a-half-month [[Battle of Okinawa]] (which cost the lives of 260,000 people, including 150,000 civilians),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Huber/Huber.asp |title=Japan's Battle of Okinawa, March–June 1945|publisher=[[Command and General Staff College]] |accessdate=2016-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214183638/http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Huber/Huber.asp |archivedate=February 14, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ways of Forgetting, Ways of Remembering: Japan in the Modern World |pages=273 |date=February 4, 2014 |publisher=New Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was faced with the prospect of invading the Japanese home islands in an operation codenamed [[Operation Downfall]]. Based on the U.S. casualties from the preceding [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island-hopping campaigns]], American commanders estimated that between 50,000 and 500,000 U.S. troops would die and at least 600,000–1,000,000 others would be injured while invading the Japanese home islands. The U.S. manufacture of 500,000 [[Purple Heart]]s from the anticipated high level of casualties during the U.S. invasion of Japan gave a demonstration of how deadly and costly it would be. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] realized he could not afford such a horrendous casualty rate, especially since over 400,000 American combatants had already died fighting in both the [[European theatre of World War II|European]] and the [[Pacific War|Pacific theaters]] of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgsc.cdmhost.com/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/p4013coll8&amp;CISOPTR=130&amp;REC=2 |title=United States Dept. of the Army, Army Battle Casualties and Non Battle Deaths in World War II |publisher=Cgsc.cdmhost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 1945, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of China issued a [[Potsdam Declaration]] that called for the [[unconditional surrender]] of Japan. It stated that if Japan did not surrender, it would face "prompt and utter destruction".&lt;ref name=atomicarchive&gt;{{cite web | title = Potsdam Declaration: Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender Issued, at Potsdam, July 26, 1945 | url = http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Hiroshima/Potsdam.shtml | publisher = National Science Digital Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = United States Department of State, Office of the Historian | url = https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/PotsdamConf | title = Milestones: 1937–1945 / The Potsdam Conference, 1945 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194738/http://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/PotsdamConf | archivedate = 2013-10-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese government [[mokusatsu|ignored]] this ultimatum, sending a message that they were not going to surrender. In response to the rejection, President Truman authorized the dropping of the atomic bombs. At the time of its use, there were only two atomic bombs available, and despite the fact that more were in production back in [[Contiguous United States|mainland U.S.]], the third bomb wouldn't be available for combat until September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Robert P.|title=Truman and the Hiroshima Cult|date=1995|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Haf2g1mbsH8C|isbn=978-0-87013-940-6|publisher=MSU Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Generals"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II, A Collection of Primary Sources| publisher=[[George Washington University]]| date=August 13, 1945| work=National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 162 | url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/72.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 1945, the uranium-type nuclear weapon codenamed "[[Little Boy]]" was detonated over the Japanese city of [[Hiroshima]] with an energy of about {{convert|15|ktonTNT|GJ|abbr=off}}, destroying nearly 50,000 buildings (including the [[headquarters]] of the [[Second General Army (Japan)|2nd General Army]] and [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Fifth Division]]) and killing approximately 70,000 people, including 20,000 Japanese combatants and 20,000 Korean slave laborers.&lt;ref name=eyewitness&gt;Adams, S. &amp; Crawford, A.. 2000.

Six days after the detonation over Nagasaki, Japan announced [[Surrender of Japan|its surrender]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] on August 15, 1945, signing the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] on September 2, 1945, officially ending the [[Pacific War]] and, therefore, World War II, as [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] had already signed its [[German Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] on May 8, 1945, ending the [[European Theatre of World War II|war in Europe]]. The two atomic bombings led, in part, to [[Post-Occupation Japan|post-war Japan's]] adopting of the [[Three Non-Nuclear Principles]], which forbade the nation from developing nuclear armaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Koizumi | first = Junichiro | authorlink = Junichiro Koizumi | title = Address by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi at the Hiroshima Memorial Service for the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony | publisher=Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet | date = August 6, 2005 | url = http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/koizumispeech/2005/08/06aisatu_e.html | accessdate = Nov 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immediately after the Japan bombings====
After the successful [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] July 16, 1945, which was the very first nuclear detonation, the [[Manhattan project]] lead manager [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] recalled:
{{quote|We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.

[[Atomic Age|Immediately after]] the atomic bombings of Japan, the status of atomic weapons in international and military relations was unclear. Presumably, the United States hoped atomic weapons could offset the Soviet Union's larger conventional ground forces in Eastern Europe, and possibly be used to pressure Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] into making concessions. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union pursued its own atomic capabilities through a combination of scientific research and [[espionage]] directed against the American program. The Soviets believed that the Americans, with their limited nuclear arsenal, were unlikely to engage in any new world wars, while the Americans were not confident they could prevent a Soviet takeover of Europe, despite their atomic advantage.

Within the United States the authority to produce and develop nuclear weapons was removed from military control and put instead under the civilian control of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]]. This decision reflected an understanding that nuclear weapons had unique risks and benefits that were separate from other military technology known at the time.

[[Image:Convair B-36 Peacemaker.jpg|thumb|right|[[Convair B-36]] bomber]]

For several years after [[World War II]], the United States developed and maintained a strategic force based on the [[Convair B-36]] [[bomber]] that would be able to attack any potential enemy from bomber bases in the United States. It deployed atomic bombs around the world for potential use in conflicts. Over a period of a few years, many in the American defense community became increasingly convinced of the invincibility of the United States to a nuclear attack. Indeed, it became generally believed that the threat of nuclear war would deter any strike against the United States.

Many proposals were suggested to put all American nuclear weapons under international control (by the newly formed [[United Nations]], for example) as an effort to deter both their usage and an [[Nuclear arms race|arms race]]. However, no terms could be arrived at that would be agreed upon by both the United States and the Soviet Union.{{Dubious|date=July 2015}} {{According to whom|date=July 2015}}

[[Image:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb|right|American and Soviet nuclear stockpiles.]]

On August 29, 1949, the [[Soviet Union]] tested its [[RDS-1|first nuclear weapon]] at [[Semipalatinsk Test Site|Semipalatinsk]] in [[Kazakhstan]] (see also [[Soviet atomic bomb project]]). Scientists in the United States from the Manhattan Project had warned that, in time, the Soviet Union would certainly develop nuclear capabilities of its own. Nevertheless, the effect upon military thinking and planning in the United States was dramatic, primarily because American military strategists had not anticipated the Soviets would "catch up" so soon. However, at this time, they had not discovered that the Soviets had conducted significant [[nuclear espionage]] of the project from spies at Los Alamos, the most significant of which was done by the theoretical physicist [[Klaus Fuchs]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The first Soviet bomb was more or less a deliberate copy of the [[Fat Man]] [[plutonium]] device. In the same year the first US-Soviet nuclear war plan was penned in the US with [[Operation Dropshot]].

With the monopoly over nuclear technology broken, worldwide nuclear proliferation accelerated. The [[United Kingdom]] tested its first independent atomic bomb in 1952, followed by [[France]] in 1960 and then [[China]] in 1964. While much smaller than the arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union, Western Europe's nuclear reserves were nevertheless a significant factor in strategic planning during the [[Cold War]]. A top-secret [[White paper|White Paper]], compiled by the [[Royal Air Force]] and produced for the British Government in 1959, estimated that British bombers carrying nuclear weapons were capable of destroying key cities and military targets in the Soviet Union, with an estimated 16 million deaths in the Soviet Union (half of whom were estimated to be killed on impact and the rest fatally injured) ''before'' bomber aircraft from the U.S. [[Strategic Air Command]] reached their targets.

===1950s===
Although the Soviet Union had nuclear weapon capabilities in the beginning of the [[Cold War]], the United States still had an advantage in terms of bombers and weapons. In any exchange of hostilities, the United States would have been capable of bombing the Soviet Union, whereas the Soviet Union would have more difficulty carrying out the reverse mission.

The widespread introduction of [[Jet engine|jet]]-powered [[interceptor aircraft]] upset this imbalance somewhat by reducing the effectiveness of the American bomber fleet. In 1949 [[Curtis LeMay]] was placed in command of the [[Strategic Air Command]] and instituted a program to update the bomber fleet to one that was all-jet. During the early 1950s the [[B-47]] and [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] were introduced, providing the ability to bomb the Soviet Union more easily. Before the development of a capable strategic missile force in the Soviet Union, much of the war-fighting doctrine held by western nations revolved around using a large number of smaller nuclear weapons in a tactical role. It is debatable whether such use could be considered "limited" however, because it was believed that the United States would use its own strategic weapons (mainly bombers at the time) should the Soviet Union deploy any kind of nuclear weapon against civilian targets. [[Douglas MacArthur]], an American general, was fired by President [[Harry Truman]], partially because he persistently requested permission to use his own discretion in deciding whether to utilize atomic weapons on the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1951 during the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/China/Nuclear/5630.html Nuclear Chronology 1945–1959]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015161227/http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/China/Nuclear/5630.html |date=October 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mao Zedong]], China's communist leader, gave the impression that he would welcome a nuclear war with the capitalists because it would annihilate what he viewed as their "imperialist" system.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946612-2,00.html Instant Wisdom: Beyond the Little Red Book]".

The concept of a "[[Fortress North America]]" emerged during the Second World War and persisted into the Cold War to refer to the option of defending Canada and the United States against their enemies if the rest of the world were lost to them. This option was rejected with the formation of NATO and the decision to permanently station troops in Europe.

In the summer of 1951 [[Project Vista]] started, in which project analysts such as [[Robert F. Christy]] looked at how to defend Western Europe from a Soviet invasion. The emerging development of [[tactical nuclear weapons]] were looked upon as a means to give Western forces a qualitative advantage over the Soviet numerical supremacy in conventional weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patrickmccray.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2004-McCray-Vista-Paper.pdf Project Vista, Caltech, and the dilemmas of Lee DuBridge]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scares about the increasing ability of the Soviet Union's strategic bomber forces surfaced during the 1950s. The defensive response by the United States was to deploy a fairly strong "layered defense" consisting of [[interceptor aircraft]] and [[Surface-to-air missile|anti-aircraft missile]]s, like the [[Project Nike|Nike]], and guns, like the [[Skysweeper]], near larger cities. However, this was a small response compared to the construction of a huge fleet of nuclear bombers. The principal [[nuclear strategy]] was to massively penetrate the Soviet Union. Because such a large area could not be defended against this overwhelming attack in any credible way, the Soviet Union would lose any exchange.

This logic became ingrained in American nuclear doctrine and persisted for much of the duration of the [[Cold War]]. As long as the strategic American nuclear forces could overwhelm their Soviet counterparts, a Soviet pre-emptive strike could be averted. Moreover, the Soviet Union could not afford to build any reasonable counterforce, as the economic output of the United States was far larger than that of the Soviets, and they would be unable to achieve "nuclear parity".

Soviet nuclear doctrine, however, did not match American nuclear doctrine.&lt;ref name="kms1.isn.ethz.ch"&gt;[http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/46280/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/14933a8e-14e8-43d7-a257-6bdab65dba50/en/ZB79_000.pdf Military Planning for European Theatre Conflict During the Cold War]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airpower.au.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1979/mar-apr/jenson.html|title=Nuclear Strategy differences in Soviet and American thinking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet military planners assumed they could win a nuclear war.&lt;ref name="kms1.isn.ethz.ch"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/63015546/Why-Russia-Thinks-It-Could-Fight-and-Win-a-Nuclear-War Why the Soviet Union thinks it can fight and win a Nuclear War], Richard Pipes, Professor of History Harvard University 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gwu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv//nukevault/ebb285/|title=Candid Interviews with Former Soviet Officials Reveal U.S. Strategic Intelligence Failure Over Decades|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they ''expected'' a large-scale nuclear exchange, followed by a "conventional war" which itself would involve heavy use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s. American doctrine rather assumed that Soviet doctrine was similar, with the ''mutual'' in [[Mutually Assured Destruction]] necessarily requiring that the other side see things in much the same way, rather than believing—as the Soviets did—that they could fight a large-scale, "combined nuclear and conventional" war.

In accordance with their doctrine, the Soviet Union conducted [[Totskoye nuclear test|large-scale military exercises]] to explore the possibility of defensive and offensive [[warfare]] during a [[nuclear war]]. The exercise, under the code name of "[[Totskoye nuclear exercise|Snowball]]", involved the detonation of a nuclear bomb about twice as powerful as that which fell on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and an army of approximately 45,000 soldiers on [[maneuvers]] through the [[hypocenter]] immediately after the blast.&lt;ref&gt;[[Viktor Suvorov]], ''[http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov7/index.html Shadow of Victory]'' ({{lang|ru|Тень победы}}), Donetsk, 2003, {{ISBN|966-696-022-2}}, pages 353–375.&lt;/ref&gt; The exercise was conducted on September 14, 1954, under command of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Georgy Zhukov]] to the north of [[Totskoye]] village in [[Orenburg Oblast]], [[Russia]].

A revolution in nuclear strategic thought occurred with the introduction of the [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM), which the Soviet Union first successfully tested in August 1957. In order to deliver a warhead to a target, a missile was much faster and more cost-effective than a bomber, and enjoyed a higher survivability due to the enormous difficulty of interception of the ICBMs (due to their high altitude and extreme speed). The Soviet Union could now afford to achieve nuclear parity with the United States in raw numbers, although for a time, they appeared to have chosen not to.

Photos of Soviet missile sites set off a wave of panic in the U.S. military, something the launch of [[Sputnik]] would do for the American public a few months later. Politicians, notably then-[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]] suggested that a "[[missile gap]]" existed between the Soviet Union and the United States.&lt;!--This was a savvy political ploy, as the US administration almost certainly knew better, and also knew that they could not be corrected without violating military security. It should be pointed out, though, that Dwight D. Eisenhower's own [[Gaither Report|Gaither panel]] had also overestimated Soviet nuclear capabilities in their 1957 report.[http://www.politicalreviewnet.com/polrev/reviews/DIPH/R_0145_2096_014_19322.asp][http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people/York/york88-con4.html] One result of this, however, was that the Soviets ''believed'' the vulnerability actually existed, with resulting temptation; luckily, cooler heads prevailed. After Kennedy won the 1960 Presidential election, the "missile gap" (conveniently) went away.--&gt;&lt;!--This political interpretation needs to be attributed or made neutral.--&gt; The US military gave missile development programs the highest national priority, and several [[reconnaissance aircraft|spy aircraft]] and [[reconnaissance satellite]]s were designed and deployed to observe Soviet progress.

Early ICBMs and bombers were relatively inaccurate, which led to the concept of [[countervalue]] strikes — attacks directly on the enemy population, which would theoretically lead to a collapse of the enemy's will to fight. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union invested in extensive protected civilian infrastructure, such as large "nuclear-proof" bunkers and non-perishable food stores. By comparison, smaller scale [[civil defense]] programs were instituted in the United States starting in the 1950s, where schools and other public buildings had basements stocked with non-perishable food supplies, canned water, first aid, and [[dosimeter]] and [[Geiger counter]] radiation-measuring devices. Many of the locations were given "[[Fallout shelter]]" designation signs. [[CONELRAD]] radio information systems were adopted, whereby the commercial radio sector (later supplemented by the [[National Emergency Alarm Repeater]]s) would broadcast on two AM frequencies in the event of a Civil Defense (CD) emergency. These two frequencies, 640 and 1240&amp;nbsp;kHz, were marked with small CD triangles on the tuning dial of radios of the period, as can still be seen on 1950s-vintage radios on online auction sites and museums. A few backyard [[fallout shelter]]s were built by private individuals.

[[Henry Kissinger]]'s view on tactical nuclear war in his controversial 1957 book [[Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy]] was that any nuclear weapon exploded in [[air burst]] mode that was below 500 kiloton in yield and thus averting serious fallout, may be more decisive and less costly in human lives than a protracted conventional war.

A list of targets made by the U.S.A. was released sometime during December 2015 by the U.S. [[National Archives and Records Administration]]. The language used to describe targets is "designated ground zeros". The list was released after a request was made during 2006 by William Burr who belongs to a research group at [[George Washington University]], and belongs to a previously [[Classified information#Top secret .28TS.29|top-secret]] 800-page document. The list is entitled "Atomic Weapons Requirements Study for 1959" and was produced by U.S. [[Strategic Air Command]] during the year 1956.&lt;ref&gt;S.

===1960s===
[[Image:Cuban missiles.jpg|thumb|right|[[F-101 Voodoo|RF-101 Voodoo]] reconnaissance photograph of the [[MRBM]] launch site in [[San Cristóbal, Cuba]] (1962)]]

In 1960, the United States developed its first [[Single Integrated Operational Plan]], a range of targeting options, and described launch procedures and target sets against which nuclear weapons would be launched, variants of which were in use from 1961 to 2003. That year also saw the start of the [[Missile Defense Alarm System]], an American system of 12 early-warning satellites that provided limited notice of Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile launches between 1960 and 1966. The [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System]] was completed in 1964.

A complex and worrisome situation developed in 1962, in what is called the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. The Soviet Union placed medium-range ballistic missiles {{convert|90|mi|km}} from the United States, possibly as a direct response to American [[Jupiter missile]]s placed in [[Turkey]]. After intense negotiations, the Soviets ended up removing the missiles from Cuba and decided to institute a massive weapons-building program of their own. In exchange, the United States dismantled its launch sites in Turkey, although this was done secretly and not publicly revealed for over two decades. [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] did not even reveal this part of the agreement when he came under fire by political opponents for mishandling the crisis. Communication delays during the crisis led to the establishment of the [[Moscow–Washington hotline]] to allow reliable, direct communications between the two nuclear powers.

By the late 1960s, the number of ICBMs and warheads was so high on both sides that it was believed that both the United States and the Soviet Union were capable of completely destroying the infrastructure and a large proportion of the population of the other country. Thus, by some western [[game theorist]]s, a [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] system known as [[mutually assured destruction]] (or ''MAD'') came into being. It was thought that no full-scale exchange between the powers would result in an outright winner, with at best one side emerging the [[pyrrhic victory|pyrrhic victor]]. Thus both sides were [[stability-instability paradox|deterred]] from risking the initiation of a direct confrontation, instead being forced to engage in lower intensity [[proxy wars]].

During this decade the [[People's Republic of China]] began to build subterranean infrastructure such as the [[Underground Project 131]] following the [[Sino-Soviet split]].

&lt;!--these next two paragraphs should be elsewhere in the text, not in "1960s"--&gt;
One drawback of the MAD doctrine was the possibility of a nuclear war occurring without either side intentionally striking first. [[Early Warning System]]s (EWS) were notoriously error-prone. For example, on 78 occasions in 1979 alone, a "missile display conference" was called to evaluate detections that were "potentially threatening to the North American continent". Some of these were trivial errors and were spotted quickly, but several went to more serious levels. On September 26, 1983, [[Stanislav Petrov]] received convincing indications of an American first strike launch against the Soviet Union, but positively identified the warning as a false alarm. Though it is unclear what role Petrov's actions played in preventing a nuclear war during this incident, he has been honored by the United Nations for his actions.

Similar incidents happened many times in the United States, due to failed computer chips,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/1998/01/00_phillips_20-mishaps.htm June 80: Faulty Computer Chip] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226153334/http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/1998/01/00_phillips_20-mishaps.htm |date=2013-12-26 }}, ''20 Mishaps that Might Have Started Accidental Nuclear War'', by Alan F. Phillips, M.D., January 1998, Nuclear Age Peace Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; misidentifications of large flights of geese, test programs, and bureaucratic failures to notify early warning military personnel of legitimate launches of test or weather missiles. For many years, the U.S. Air Force's strategic bombers were kept airborne on a daily rotating basis "around the clock" (see [[Operation Chrome Dome]]), until the number and severity of accidents, the [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash]] in particular, persuaded policymakers it was not worthwhile.

===1970s===
Israel responded to the Arab [[Yom Kippur War]] attack on 6 October 1973 by assembling 13 nuclear weapons in a tunnel under the [[Negev desert]] when Syrian tanks were sweeping in across the [[Golan Heights]]. On 8 October 1973, Israeli Prime Minister Mrs [[Golda Meir]] authorized Defense Minister [[Moshe Dayan]] to activate the 13 Israeli nuclear warheads and distribute them to [[Israeli air force]] units, with the intent that they be used if Israel began to be overrun.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Nuclear Weapons in the Cold War, Bernard Brodie&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 1973, as US [[President Nixon]] was preoccupied with the  [[Watergate scandal]], Henry Kissinger ordered a [[DEFCON]]-3 alert preparing American B-52 nuclear bombers for war. Intelligence reports indicated that the USSR was preparing to defend Egypt in its [[Yom Kippur war]] with Israel. It had become apparent that if Israel had dropped nuclear weapons on Egypt or Syria, as it prepared to do, then the USSR would have retaliated against Israel, with the US then committed to providing Israeli assistance, possibly escalating to a general nuclear war.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

By the late 1970s, people in both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], along with the rest of the world, had been living with the concept of [[mutual assured destruction]] (MAD) for about a decade, and it became deeply ingrained into the psyche and popular culture of those countries.

On May 18, 1974, [[India]] conducted its first nuclear test in the [[Pokhran]] test range. The name of the operation was [[Smiling Buddha]], and India termed the test as a "peaceful nuclear explosion".

The Soviet [[Duga radar|Duga]] early warning [[over-the-horizon radar]] system was made operational in 1976. The extremely powerful radio transmissions needed for such a system led to much disruption of civilian shortwave broadcasts, earning it the nickname "[[Russian Woodpecker]]".

The idea that any nuclear conflict would eventually escalate was a challenge for military strategists. This challenge was particularly severe for the United States and its [[NATO]] allies. It was believed (until the 1970s) that a Soviet tank invasion of Western [[Europe]] would quickly overwhelm NATO conventional forces, leading to the necessity of the West escalating to the use of tactical nuclear weapons, one of which was the [[W-70]].

This strategy had one major (and possibly critical) flaw, which was soon realized by military analysts but highly underplayed by the U.S. military: conventional [[NATO]] forces in the European theatre of war were far outnumbered by similar Soviet and [[Warsaw Pact]] forces, and it was assumed that in case of a major Soviet attack (commonly envisioned as the "Red tanks rolling towards the [[North Sea]]" scenario) that NATO—in the face of quick conventional defeat—would soon have no other choice but to resort to tactical nuclear strikes against these forces. Most analysts agreed that once the first nuclear exchange had occurred, escalation to global nuclear war would likely become inevitable. The Soviet bloc's vision of an atomic war between NATO and Warsaw Pact forces was simulated in the top secret exercise [[Seven Days to the River Rhine]] in 1979. The British government exercised their vision of Soviet nuclear attack with [[Square Leg]] in early 1980.

Large hardened nuclear [[weapon storage area]]s were built across European countries in anticipation of local US and European forces falling back as the conventional NATO defense from the Soviet Union, named [[REFORGER]], was believed to only be capable of stalling the Soviets for a short time.

In the late 1970s and, particularly, during the early 1980s under U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], the United States renewed its commitment to a more powerful military, which required a large increase in spending on U.S. military programs. These programs, which were originally part of the defense budget of U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]], included spending on conventional and nuclear weapons systems. Under Reagan, defensive systems like the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] were emphasized as well.

Another major shift in nuclear doctrine was the development and the improvement of the [[submarine]]-launched, nuclear-armed, ballistic missile, or [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|SLBM]]. It was hailed by many military theorists as a weapon that would make nuclear war less likely. SLBMs—which can move with "stealth" (greatly lessened detectability) virtually anywhere in the world—give a nation a "[[second strike]]" capability (i.e., after absorbing a "first strike"). Before the advent of the SLBM, thinkers feared that a nation might be tempted to initiate a first strike if it felt confident that such a strike would incapacitate the nuclear arsenal of its enemy, making retaliation impossible. With the advent of SLBMs, no nation could be certain that a first strike would incapacitate its enemy's entire nuclear arsenal. To the contrary, it would have to fear a near certain retaliatory second strike from SLBMs. Thus, a first strike was a much less feasible (or desirable) option, and a deliberately initiated nuclear war was thought to be less likely to start.

However, it was soon realized that submarines could approach enemy coastlines undetected and decrease the warning time (the time between detection of the missile launch and the impact of the missile) from as much as half an hour to possibly under three minutes. This effect was especially significant to the United States, Britain and China, whose capitals all lay within 100 miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) of their coasts. Moscow was much more secure from this type of threat, due to its considerable distance from the sea. This greatly increased the credibility of a "surprise first strike" by one faction and (theoretically) made it possible to knock out or disrupt the [[chain of command]] of a target nation before any counterstrike could be ordered (known as a "[[decapitation strike]]"). It strengthened the notion that a nuclear war could possibly be "won", resulting not only in greatly increased tensions and increasing calls for [[fail-deadly]] control systems, but also in a dramatic increase in military spending. The submarines and their missile systems were very expensive, and one fully equipped nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed missile submarine could cost more than the entire [[Measures of national income and output#Gross National Product|GNP]] of a [[developing country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/subs/history/timeline/cost/index.html|title=The Cost of Submarines|accessdate=2008-07-13|work=Fast Attacks and Boomers}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also calculated, however, that the greatest cost came in the development of ''both'' sea- and land-based anti-submarine defenses and in improving and strengthening the "chain of command", and as a result, military spending skyrocketed.

South Africa developed a nuclear weapon capability during the 1970s and early 1980s. It was operational for a brief period before being dismantled in the early 1990s.

According to the 1980 [[United Nations]] report ''General and Complete Disarmament: Comprehensive Study on Nuclear Weapons: Report of the Secretary-General'', it was estimated that there were a total of about 40,000 [[Historical nuclear weapons stockpiles and nuclear tests by country|nuclear warheads in existence]] at that time, with a potential combined explosive yield of approximately 13,000 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]]. By comparison, when the volcano [[Mount Tambora]] erupted in 1815—turning 1816 into the [[Year Without A Summer]] due to the levels of [[global dimming]] [[sulfate]] aerosols and ash expelled—it exploded with a force of roughly 800 to 1,000 megatons,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and ejected {{convert|160|km3|cumi|abbr=on}} of mostly rock/[[tephra]],&lt;ref name="Stothers1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stothers | first = Richard B. | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | title = The Great Tambora Eruption in 1815 and Its Aftermath | volume = 224 | issue = 4654 | year = 1984 | pages = 1191–1198 | doi = 10.1126/science.224.4654.1191 | pmid = 17819476|bibcode = 1984Sci...224.1191S }}&lt;/ref&gt; that included 120 million [[tonne]]s of sulfur dioxide as [[Mount Tambora#Global effects|an upper estimate]].&lt;ref name="Oppenheimer2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Oppenheimer | first = Clive | title = Climatic, environmental and human consequences of the largest known historic eruption: Tambora volcano (Indonesia) 1815 | journal = Progress in Physical Geography | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | year = 2003 | pages = 230–259 | doi = 10.1191/0309133303pp379ra}}&lt;/ref&gt; A larger eruption, approximately 74,000 years ago, in [[Mount Toba]] produced {{convert|2800|km3|abbr=on}} of tephra, forming [[lake Toba]],&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2005/05_04_28.html |title=Supersized eruptions are all the rage! |date=April 28, 2005 |publisher=[[USGS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produced an estimated {{convert|6000|e6t|ST}} of sulfur dioxide.&lt;ref name=robock2009&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Robock, A.|author2=C.M.

However, comparisons with [[supervolcanos|supervolcanoes]] are more misleading than helpful due to the different [[aerosol]]s released, the likely [[air burst]] fuzing height of nuclear weapons and the globally scattered location of these potential nuclear detonations all being in contrast to the singular and subterranean nature of a supervolcanic eruption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, assuming the entire world stockpile of weapons were grouped together, it would be difficult, due to the [[nuclear fratricide]] effect, to ensure the individual weapons would go off all at once. Nonetheless, many people believe that a full-scale nuclear war would result, through the nuclear winter effect, in the [[human extinction|extinction of the human species]], though not all analysts agree on the assumptions that underpin these nuclear winter models.&lt;ref name="bmartin.cc"/&gt;

On Sept. 1, 1983, [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] was shot down by Soviet jet fighters.  On the 26th, a Soviet early warning station under the command of [[Stanislav Petrov]] falsely detected 5 inbound [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s from the US. Petrov correctly assessed the situation as a false alarm, and hence did not report his finding to his superiors.  It is quite possible that his actions prevented "[[World War III]]", as the Soviet policy at that time was [[Launch on warning|immediate nuclear response]] upon discovering inbound ballistic missiles.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The world came unusually close to nuclear war when the Soviet Union thought that the NATO military exercise [[Able Archer 83]] was a ruse or "cover-up" to begin a nuclear first strike. The Soviets responded by raising readiness and preparing their nuclear arsenal for [[High-alert nuclear weapon|immediate use]]. Soviet fears of an attack ceased once the exercise concluded without incident.

===Post-Cold War===
Although the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] ended the [[Cold War]] and greatly reduced tensions between the [[United States]] and the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], the Soviet Union's formal successor state, both countries remained in a "nuclear stand-off" due to the continuing presence of a very large number of deliverable nuclear warheads on both sides. Additionally, the end of the Cold War led the United States to become increasingly concerned with the development of nuclear technology by other nations outside of the former Soviet Union. In 1995, a branch of the U.S. Strategic Command produced an outline of forward-thinking strategies in the document "[[Essentials of Post–Cold War Deterrence]]".

In 1996, a Russian [[Continuity of government#Soviet Union and Russia|continuity of government facility]], [[Kosvinsky Mountain]], which is believed to be a counterpart to the US [[Cheyenne Mountain Complex]], was completed.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowonheartland.net/2012/02/russias-top-secret-bases.html |title=WINDOW ON HEARTLAND Geopolitical notes on Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424050959/http://www.windowonheartland.net/2012/02/russias-top-secret-bases.html |archivedate=April 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/1997/bmd970404a.htm  "Moscow builds bunkers against nuclear attack"], by [[Bill Gertz]], ''[[Washington Times]]'', April 1, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/kosvinsky.htm |title=Global Security.org Kosvinsky Mountain, Kos'vinskiy Kamen', Gora, MT 59°31'00"N   59°04'00"E}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to resist US [[nuclear bunker buster|earth-penetrating nuclear warheads]],&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; and is believed to host the Russian [[Strategic Rocket Forces]] alternate command post, a post for the general staff built to compensate for the vulnerability of older Soviet era command posts in the Moscow region.

As a consequence of the [[9/11]] attacks, American forces immediately increased their readiness to the highest level in 28 years, closing the blast doors of the NORAD's [[Cheyenne Mountain Complex|Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center]] for the first time due to a non-exercise event. But unlike similar increases during the Cold War, Russia immediately decided to stand down a large military exercise in the Arctic region, in order to minimize the risk of incidents, rather than following suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a1115putinspeaks|title=Context of '(After 11:15 a.m.) September 11, 2001: Russian President Putin Speaks with President Bush'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former chair of the [[United Nations]] [[Nuclear disarmament|disarmament]] committee stated that there are more than 16,000 strategic and tactical nuclear weapons ready for deployment and another 14,000 in storage, with the U.S. having nearly 7,000 ready for use and 3,000 in storage, and Russia having about 8,500 ready for use and 11,000 in storage. In addition, [[China]] is thought to possess about 400 nuclear weapons, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] about 200, [[France]] about 350, [[India]] about 80–100, and [[Pakistan]] 100–110. [[North Korea]] is confirmed as having nuclear weapons, though it is not known how many, with most estimates between 1 and 10. [[Israel]] is also widely believed to [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|possess usable nuclear weapons]]. NATO has [[Nuclear sharing|stationed]] about 480 American nuclear weapons in Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, and Turkey, and several other nations are thought to be in pursuit of an arsenal of their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/CityandRegion/2006/02/14/1441292-sun.html London Free Press – Disarmament expert warns of nuclear threat] Non functioning link&lt;/ref&gt;

A key development in nuclear warfare throughout the 2000s and early 2010s is the [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation]] of nuclear weapons to the [[Developing country|developing world]], with [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] both publicly testing several nuclear devices, and [[North Korea]] conducting an underground nuclear test on October 9, 2006. The U.S. Geological Survey measured a 4.2 magnitude earthquake in the area where the North Korean test is said to have occurred. A further test was announced by the North Korean government on May 25, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8067438.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Asia-Pacific – N Korea faces new UN resolution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]], meanwhile, has embarked on a nuclear program which, while officially for civilian purposes, has come under close scrutiny by the United Nations and many individual states.

Recent studies undertaken by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] cite the enduring India-Pakistan conflict as the one "flash point" most likely to escalate into a nuclear war. During the [[Kargil War]] in 1999, Pakistan came close to using its nuclear weapons in case the conventional military situation underwent further deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1989886.stm|title=Pakistan 'prepared nuclear strike'|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan's foreign minister had even warned that it would "use any weapon in our arsenal", hinting at a nuclear strike against India.&lt;ref&gt;"Pakistan May Use Any Weapon," The News, Islamabad,
May 31, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was condemned by the international community, with Pakistan denying it later on. This conflict remains the only war (of any sort) between two declared nuclear powers. The [[2001-2002 India-Pakistan standoff]] again stoked fears of nuclear war between the two countries. Despite these very serious and relatively recent threats, relations between India and Pakistan have been improving somewhat over the last few years. However, with the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|November 26, 2008 Mumbai terror attacks]], tensions again worsened.

Another potential geopolitical issue which is considered particularly worrisome by military analysts is a possible conflict between the [[United States]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] over [[Taiwan]]. Although economic forces are thought to have reduced the possibility of a military conflict, there remains concern about the increasing military buildup of [[China]] (China is rapidly increasing its naval capacity), and that any move toward [[Taiwan independence]] could potentially spin out of control.

[[Israel]] is thought to possess somewhere between one hundred and four hundred nuclear warheads. It has been asserted that the [[Dolphin-class submarine]]s which Israel received from [[Germany]] have been adapted to carry Popeye [[cruise missile]]s with nuclear warheads, so as to give Israel a [[second strike]] capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/08/25/israel_buys_2_nuclear_capable_submarines_from_germany/|title=Israel buys 2 nuclear-capable submarines from Germany|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel has been involved in wars with its neighbors in the [[Middle East]] (and with other "non-state actors") on numerous prior occasions, and its small geographic size and population could mean that, in the event of future wars, the Israeli military might have very little time to react to an invasion or other major threat. Such a situation could escalate to nuclear warfare very quickly in some scenarios.

The country declared Japan as its first target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/391376/North-Korea-states-nuclear-war-is-unavoidable-as-it-declares-first-target-will-be-Japan|title=North Korea states 'nuclear war is unavoidable' as it declares first target will be Japan|publisher=Express|author=Meredith, Charlotte|date=2013-04-12|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year of 2014, when Russian relationships with the USA had become worse, it was stated by the Russian state-owned [[Russia 1]] TV channel that ‘Russia is the only country in the world that is really capable of turning the USA into radioactive ash’.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-russia-kiselyov/russia-can-turn-us-to-radioactive-ash-kremlin-backed-journalist-idUSL6N0MD0P920140316&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sub-strategic use===
{{see also|Nuclear bunker buster|Edward Teller#Decision to drop the bombs}}
The above examples envisage nuclear warfare at a strategic level, i.e., [[total war]]. However, nuclear powers have the ability to undertake more limited engagements.

"Sub-strategic use" includes the use of either "low-yield" tactical nuclear weapons, or of [[variable yield]] [[strategic nuclear weapon]]s in a very limited role, as compared to battlefield exchanges of larger-yield [[strategic nuclear weapon]]s. This was described by the UK Parliamentary [[Defence Select Committee]] as "the launch of one or a limited number of missiles against an adversary as a means of conveying a political message, warning or demonstration of resolve".&lt;ref&gt;UK Parliament, House of Commons, "Select Committee on Defence, Eighth Report", ''[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmdfence/986/98605.htm]'', 20 June 2006.  Fetched from URL on 23 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that all current nuclear weapons states possess tactical nuclear weapons, with the exception of the [[United Kingdom]], which decommissioned its tactical warheads in 1998. However, the UK does possess scalable-yield strategic warheads, and this technology tends to blur the difference between "strategic", "sub-strategic", and "tactical" use or weapons. American, French and British nuclear submarines are believed to carry at least ''some'' missiles with [[dial-a-yield]] warheads for this purpose, potentially allowing a strike as low as one [[kiloton]] (or less) against a single target. Only the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Republic of India]] have declarative, unqualified, unconditional "[[no first use]]" nuclear weapons policies. India and Pakistan maintain only a [[credible minimum deterrence|credible minimum]] [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]].

Commodore [[Tim Hare]], former Director of Nuclear Policy at the [[British Ministry of Defence]], has described "sub-strategic use" as offering the Government "an extra option in the escalatory process before it goes for an all-out strategic strike which would deliver unacceptable damage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmdfence/986/98605.htm#a11|title=House of Commons – Defence – Eighth Report – THE 1998 STRATEGIC DEFENCE REVIEW|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this sub-strategic capacity has been criticized as potentially increasing the "acceptability" of using nuclear weapons. Combined with the trend in the reduction in the worldwide nuclear arsenal as of 2007 is the warhead miniaturization and modernization of the remaining strategic weapons that is presently occurring in all the declared nuclear weapon states, into more "usable" configurations. The [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] suggests that this is creating a culture where use of these weapons is more acceptable and therefore is increasing the risk of war, as these modern weapons do not possess the same psychological deterrent value as the large Cold-War era, multi-megaton warheads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-06/12/content_892127.htm Risk of nuclear warfare rising] (AP) Updated: 2007-06-12 08:36&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ways, this present change in the [[balance of terror]] can be seen as the complete embracement of the switch from the 1950s [[Eisenhower|Eisenhower doctrine]] of "[[massive retaliation]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Matthew|last=Jones|title=Targeting China: U.S. Nuclear Planning and 'Massive Retaliation' in East Asia, 1953–1955|journal=Journal of Cold War Studies|year=2008|volume=10|issue=4|pages=37–65|doi=10.1162/jcws.2008.10.4.37|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; to one of "[[flexible response]]", which has been growing in importance in the US nuclear war fighting plan/[[Single Integrated Operational Plan|SIOP]] every decade since.

For example, the United States adopted a policy in 1996 of allowing the targeting of its nuclear weapons at non-state actors ("[[terrorists]]") armed with [[weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Daniel Plesch|author2=Stephen Young|title=Senseless policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgsAAAAAMBAJ|journal=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]|year=1998|publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another dimension to the tactical use of nuclear weapons is that of such weapons deployed at sea for use against surface and submarine vessels. Until 1992, vessels of the United States Navy (and their aircraft) deployed various such weapons as bombs, rockets (guided and unguided), torpedoes, and depth charges. Such tactical naval nuclear weapons were considered more acceptable to use early in a conflict because there would be few civilian casualties. It was feared by many planners that such use would probably quickly have escalated into large-scale nuclear war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declassified: Nuclear Weapons at Sea, Conclusions and Recommendations|url=https://fas.org/blogs/security/2016/02/nuclear-weapons-at-sea/|website=Federation of American Scientists|accessdate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation was particularly exacerbated by the fact that such weapons at sea were not constrained by the safeguards provided by the [[Permissive Action Link]] attached to U.S. Air Force and Army nuclear weapons. It is unknown if the navies of the other nuclear powers yet today deploy tactical nuclear weapons at sea.

The 2018 US Nuclear Posture Review emphasised the need for the US to have sub-strategic nuclear weapons as additional layers for its nuclear deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2018 Nuclear Posture Review|url=https://www.defense.gov/News/SpecialReports/2018NuclearPostureReview.aspx|website=US Defense Department|accessdate=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear terrorism==
{{Main|Nuclear terrorism}}
[[Nuclear terrorism]] by non-state organizations or actors (even individuals) is a largely unknown and understudied factor in nuclear deterrence thinking, as states possessing nuclear weapons are susceptible to retaliation in kind, while sub- or trans-state actors may be less so. The collapse of the Soviet Union has given rise to the possibility that former Soviet nuclear weapons might become available on the [[black market]] (so-called 'loose nukes').

A number of other concerns have been expressed about the security of nuclear weapons in newer nuclear powers with relatively less stable governments, such as [[Pakistan]], but in each case, the fears have been addressed to some extent by statements and evidence provided by those nations, as well as cooperative programs between nations. Worry remains, however, in many circles that a relative decrease in security of nuclear weapons has emerged in recent years, and that terrorists or others may attempt to exert control over (or use) nuclear weapons, militarily applicable technology, or nuclear materials and fuel.

Another possible nuclear terrorism threat are devices designed to disperse radioactive materials over a large area using conventional explosives, called [[dirty bomb]]s. The detonation of a "dirty bomb" would not cause a nuclear explosion, nor would it release enough radiation to kill or injure a large number of people. However, it could cause severe disruption and require potentially very costly decontamination procedures and increased spending on security measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/dirty-bombs-bg.html|title=Backgrounder on Dirty Bombs|author=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|date=May 2007|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survival==
{{see also|Nuclear famine}}
The predictions of the effects of a major [[countervalue]] nuclear exchange include millions of city dweller deaths within a short period of time. Some 1980s predictions had gone further and argued that a full-scale nuclear war could eventually bring about the [[Human extinction|extinction of the human race]].&lt;ref name=Ehrlich/&gt; Such predictions, sometimes but not always based on total war with nuclear arsenals at [[Cold War]] highs, received contemporary criticism.&lt;ref name="bmartin.cc"/&gt; On the other hand, some 1980s governmental predictions, such as [[FEMA]]'s [[CRP-2B]] and NATO's ''Carte Blanche,'' have received criticism from groups like the [[Federation of American Scientists]] for being overly optimistic. CRP-2B, for instance, infamously predicted that 80% of Americans would survive a nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union, a figure that neglected nuclear war's impacts on healthcare infrastructure, the food supply, and the ecosystem and assumed that all major cities could be successfully evacuated within 3–5 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/lib-www/la-pubs/00173165.pdf |title=NUCLEAR WINTER: THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF HUMAN SURVIVAL |last1=Bumstead |first1=Pamela |date=December 6, 1985 |publisher=American Anthropological Association |location=Washington, DC |conference=84th Annual Meeting of the American Anthropological Association
 |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Cold War publications advocated preparations that could purportedly enable a large proportion of civilians to survive even a total nuclear war. Among the most famous of these is [[Nuclear War Survival Skills]].&lt;ref name="NWSS1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=6–11|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p911.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid injury and death from a nuclear weapons heat flash and blast effects, the two most far ranging prompt [[effects of nuclear weapons]], schoolchildren were taught to [[duck and cover]] by the early Cold War [[Duck and Cover (film)|film of the same name]]. Such advice is once again being given in case of [[nuclear terrorism|nuclear terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/01/the-unexpected-return-of-duck-and-cover/68776/|title=The Unexpected Return of 'Duck and Cover'|author=Glenn Harlan Reynolds|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prussian blue]], or "Radiogardase", is stockpiled in the US, along with [[potassium iodide]] and [[DPTA]] as pharmaceuticals useful in treating internal exposure to harmful [[radioisotopes]] in fallout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remm.nlm.gov/sns.htm|title=Strategic National Stockpile (SNS)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publications on adapting to a changing diet and supplying nutritional food sources following a nuclear war, with particular focus on agricultural [[radioecology]], include ''Nutrition in the postattack environment'' by the [[RAND corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM5052.html|title=Nutrition in the postattack environment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British government developed a public alert system for use during nuclear attack with the expectation of a [[four-minute warning]] before detonation. The United States expected a warning time of anywhere from half an hour (for land-based missiles) to less than three minutes (for submarine-based weapons). Many countries maintain plans for [[continuity of government]] and [[continuity of operations]] following a nuclear attack or similar disasters. These range from a [[designated survivor]], intended to ensure survival of some form of government leadership, to the Soviet [[Dead Hand (nuclear war)|Dead Hand]] system, which allows for retaliation even if all Soviet leadership were destroyed. Nuclear submarines are given [[letters of last resort]]: orders on what action to take in the event that an enemy nuclear strike has destroyed the government.

A number of other countries around the world have taken significant efforts to maximize their survival prospects in the event of large calamities, both natural and manmade. For example, metro stations in [[Pyongyang Metro|Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]], were constructed {{convert|110|m|ft}} below ground, and were designed to serve as nuclear shelters in the event of war, with each station entrance built with thick steel blast doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Martin|title=Korea|year=2007|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-558-1|author2=Bartlett, Ray |author3=Whyte Rob |page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Springer|first=Chris|title=Pyongyang: the hidden history of the North Korean capital|year=2003|publisher=Entente Bt|isbn=978-963-00-8104-7|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of privately funded [[fallout shelter]]s is the [[Ark Two Shelter]] in [[Ontario]], Canada, and [[Autonomous building|autonomous shelters]] have been constructed with an emphasis on post-war networking and reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvblogs.nationalgeographic.com/2012/03/27/doomsday-preppers-its-gonna-get-worse-tonight-at-9p-etpt/|title=Doomsday Preppers: It’s Gonna Get Worse Tonight at 9P et/pt|work=[[Nat Geo TV]] Blogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Switzerland]], the majority of homes have an underground [[blast shelter|blast]] and fallout shelter. The country has an overcapacity of such shelters and can accommodate slightly more than the nation's population size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304231204576405700994655570?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_world | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Deborah | last=Ball | title=Swiss Renew Push for Bomb Shelters | date=2011-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6347519.stm | work=BBC News | first=Imogen | last=Foulkes | title=Swiss still braced for nuclear war | date=2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the nuclear fallout shelters described above are the ideal long term protection methods against dangerous radiation exposure in the event of a nuclear catastrophe, it is also necessary to have [[Radiation protection#Externally Penetrating Radiation Protective Equipment|mobile protection equipment]] for medical and security personnel to safely assist in containment, evacuation, and many other necessary public safety objectives which ensue as a result of nuclear detonation. There are many basic shielding strategies used to protect against the deposition of radio active material from external radiation environments. Respirators which protect against internal deposition are used to prevent the inhalation and ingestion of radioactive material and dermal protective equipment which is used to protect against the deposition of material on external structures like skin, hair, and clothing. While these protection strategies do slightly reduce the exposure, they provide almost no protection from externally penetrating [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]], which is the cause of [[Acute radiation syndrome|Acute Radiation Syndrome]] and can be extremely lethal in high dosages. Naturally, shielding the entire body from high energy [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]] is optimal, but the required mass to provide adequate attenuation makes functional movement nearly impossible.

Recent scientific studies have shown the feasibility of partial body shielding as a viable protection strategy against externally penetrating gamma radiation. The concept is based in providing sufficient attenuation to only the most radio-sensitive organs and tissues in efforts to defer the onset of [[Acute radiation syndrome|Acute Radiation Syndrome]], the most immediate threat to humans from high doses of gamma radiation. [[Acute radiation syndrome|Acute Radiation Syndrome]] is a result of irreversible bone marrow damage from high energy radiation exposure. Due to the regenerative property of [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s found in bone marrow, it is only necessary to protect enough bone marrow to repopulate the exposed areas of the body with the shielded supply. Because 50% of the body's supply of bone marrow is stored in the pelvic region which is also in close proximity to other radio-sensitive organs in the abdomen, the lower torso is a logical choice as the primary target for protection.&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, Gideon; Kase, Kenneth; Orion, Itzhak; Broisman, Andrey; Milstein, Oren (2017-09). "Selective Shielding of Bone Marrow". ''Health Physics''. '''113''' (3): 195–208. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1097/hp.0000000000000688. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] 0017-9078.&lt;/ref&gt;

This research allows for the development of relatively lightweight [[Radiation protection#Externally Penetrating Radiation Protective Equipment|mobile radiation protection equipment]] which can provide life saving protection from intense radioactive environments without hindering functional mobility. This technology has wide-ranging military, emergency personnel, private sector, and civilian application as the radiation risks of nuclear energy, warfare, and terrorism around the world continue to grow. One example of such technology is the [[StemRad#Technology|360 Gamma]], a radiation protection belt designed on the principles of bone marrow shielding.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Heaviside was born in [[Camden Town]], London, at 55 Kings Street&lt;ref name = Nahin&gt;{{cite book| ref=Nahin|author = Nahin, Paul J. |authorlink=Paul J. Nahin| title = Oliver Heaviside: The Life, Work, and Times of an Electrical Genius of the Victorian Age| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=e9wEntQmA0IC&amp;pg=PA13| date = 9 October 2002| publisher = JHU Press| isbn = 978-0-8018-6909-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} (now Plender Street). He was a short and red-headed child, and suffered from [[scarlet fever]] when young, which left him with a hearing impairment. A small legacy enabled the family to move to a better part of Camden when he was thirteen and he was sent to Camden House Grammar School. He was a good student, placed fifth out of five hundred students in 1865, but his parents could not keep him at school after he was 16, so he continued studying for a year by himself and had no further formal education.&lt;ref name=Hunt91&gt;Bruce J.

Heaviside's uncle by marriage was Sir [[Charles Wheatstone]] (1802–1875), an internationally celebrated expert in telegraphy and electromagnetism, and the original co-inventor of the first commercially successful telegraph in the mid-1830s. Wheatstone took a strong interest in his nephew's education&lt;ref name = "wheatstone"&gt;{{cite book|  last1= Sarkar|first1= T.

Two years later he took a job as a telegraph operator with the Danish [[Great Northern Telegraph Company]] laying a cable from Newcastle to [[Denmark]] using British contractors. He soon became an electrician. Heaviside continued to study while working, and by the age of 22 he published an article in the prestigious ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'' on 'The Best Arrangement of [[Wheatstone's Bridge]] for measuring a Given Resistance with a Given Galvanometer and Battery'{{sfn|Heaviside|1892|pp=3-8}} which received positive comments from physicists who had unsuccessfully tried to solve this algebraic problem, including [[Sir William Thomson]], to whom he gave a copy of the paper, and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. When he published an article on the  [[Duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]] method of using a telegraph cable,{{sfn|Heaviside|1892|pp=18-34}} he poked fun at R. S. Culley, the engineer in chief of the [[Post Office (UK)#Telegraph|Post Office telegraph]] system, who had been dismissing duplex as impractical. Later in 1873 his application to join the [[Society of Telegraph Engineers]] was turned down with the comment that "they didn't want telegraph clerks". This riled Heaviside, who asked Thomson to sponsor him, and along with support of the society's president he was admitted "despite the P.O. snobs".&lt;ref name=Hunt91/&gt;{{rp|60}}

In 1873 Heaviside had encountered Maxwell's newly published, and later famous, two-volume ''[[Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]''. In his old age Heaviside recalled:
{{quote|
I remember my first look at the great treatise of Maxwell's when I was a young man… I saw that it was great, greater and greatest, with prodigious possibilities in its power… I was determined to master the book and set to work. I was very ignorant. I had no knowledge of mathematical analysis (having learned only school algebra and trigonometry which I had largely forgotten) and thus my work was laid out for me. It took me several years before I could understand as much as I possibly could. Then I set Maxwell aside and followed my own course. And I progressed much more quickly… It will be understood that I preach the gospel according to my interpretation of Maxwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Sarkar|first1= T.

Undertaking research from home, he helped develop [[transmission line]] theory (also known as the "''[[telegrapher's equations]]''"). Heaviside showed [[Heaviside condition|mathematically]] that uniformly distributed [[inductance]] in a telegraph line would diminish both [[attenuation]] and [[distortion]], and that, if the inductance were great enough and the [[Electrical insulation|insulation]] [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] not too high, the [[Digital circuit|circuit]] would be distortionless while [[Current (electricity)|currents]] of all [[Frequency|frequencies]] would have equal speeds of propagation.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Telephone |volume=26 |page=554 |first=Harry Robert |last=Kempe |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaviside's equations helped further the implementation of the telegraph.

===Middle years===
From 1882 to 1902, except for three years, he contributed regular articles to the trade paper ''[[The Electrician]]'', which wished to improve its standing, for which he was paid £40 per year. This was hardly enough to live on, but his demands were very small and he was doing what he most wanted to. Between 1883 and 1887 these averaged 2–3 articles per month and these articles later formed the bulk of his ''Electromagnetic Theory'' and ''Electrical Papers''.&lt;ref name=Hunt91/&gt;{{rp|71}}

In 1880, Heaviside researched the [[skin effect]] in telegraph transmission lines. That same year he patented, in England, the [[coaxial cable]]. In 1884 he recast Maxwell's mathematical analysis from its original cumbersome form (they had already been recast as [[quaternion]]s) to its modern [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] terminology, thereby reducing twelve of the original twenty equations in twenty unknowns down to the four [[differential equation]]s in two unknowns we now know as [[Maxwell's equations]]. The four re-formulated Maxwell's equations describe the nature of electric charges (both static and moving), magnetic fields, and the relationship between the two, namely electromagnetic fields.

Between 1880 and 1887, Heaviside developed the [[operator theory|operational calculus]] using ''p'' for the [[differential operator]], (which Boole&lt;ref&gt;"A Treatise on Differential Equations", 1859&lt;/ref&gt; had previously denoted by ''D''), giving a method of solving differential equations by direct solution as [[algebraic equation]]s. This later caused a great deal of controversy, owing to its lack of [[rigour]]. He famously said, "Mathematics is an experimental science, and definitions do not come first, but later on."&lt;ref&gt;Heaviside, "On Operators in Physical Mathematics, Part II"&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion he asked somewhat more defensively, "Shall I refuse my dinner because I do not fully understand the process of digestion?"&lt;ref&gt;Heaviside, "Mathematics and the Age of the Earth" in ''Electromagnetic Theory'' vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, Heaviside worked with his brother Arthur on a paper entitled "The Bridge System of Telephony". However the paper was blocked by Arthur's superior, [[William Henry Preece]] of the [[General Post Office|Post Office]], because part of the proposal was that [[loading coil]]s ([[inductor]]s) should be added to telephone and telegraph lines to increase their self-induction and correct the distortion which they suffered. Preece had recently declared self-inductance to be the great enemy of clear transmission. Heaviside was also convinced that Preece was behind the sacking of the editor of ''The Electrician'' which brought his long-running series of articles to a halt (until 1891).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Heaviside, Oliver|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|first=Bruce J.|last=Hunt|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33796|subscription=yes|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a long history of animosity between Preece and Heaviside.  Heaviside considered Preece to be mathematically incompetent, an assessment supported by the biographer [[Paul J. Nahin]]: "Preece was a powerful government official, enormously ambitious, and in some remarkable ways, an utter blockhead." Preece's motivations in suppressing Heaviside's work were more to do with protecting Preece's own reputation and avoiding having to admit error than any perceived faults in Heaviside's work.&lt;ref name=Nahin/&gt;{{rp| xi–xvii, 162–183}}

The importance of Heaviside's work remained undiscovered for some time after publication in ''The Electrician'', and so its rights lay in the public domain. In 1897, [[AT&amp;T Corp.|AT&amp;T]] employed one of its own scientists, [[George Ashley Campbell|George A. Campbell]], and an external investigator [[Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin|Michael I. Pupin]] to find some respect in which Heaviside's work was incomplete or incorrect.  Campbell and Pupin extended Heaviside's work, and AT&amp;T filed for patents covering not only their research, but also the technical method of constructing the coils previously invented by Heaviside. AT&amp;T later offered Heaviside money in exchange for his rights; it is possible that the Bell engineers' respect for Heaviside influenced this offer.  However, Heaviside refused the offer, declining to accept any money unless the company were to give him full recognition.  Heaviside was chronically poor, making his refusal of the offer even more striking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Wiener, Norbert]] | title = Invention: The Care and Feeding of Ideas| year = 1993| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-73111-8| pages = 70–75| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3Q2qOtOeLYC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But this setback had the effect of turning Heaviside's attention towards electromagnetic radiation,{{sfn|Hunt|2004}} and in two papers of 1888 and 1889, he calculated the deformations of electric and magnetic fields surrounding a moving charge, as well as the effects of it entering a denser medium. This included a prediction of what is now known as [[Cherenkov radiation]], and inspired his friend [[George FitzGerald]] to suggest what now is known as the [[Length contraction#Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction hypothesis|Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction]].

In 1889, Heaviside first published a correct derivation of the magnetic force on a moving charged particle,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/14786448908628362| title = XXXIX.On the electromagnetic effects due to the motion of electrification through a dielectric| journal = Philosophical Magazine |series=Series 5| volume = 27| issue = 167| pages = 324| year = 1889| last1 = Heaviside | first1 = O. }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now called the [[Lorentz force]].

In the late 1880s and early 1890s, Heaviside worked on the [[concept]] of [[electromagnetic mass]]. Heaviside treated this as material [[mass]], capable of producing the same effects. [[Wilhelm Wien]] later verified Heaviside's expression (for low [[Velocity|velocities]]).

In 1891 the British [[Royal Society]] recognized Heaviside's contributions to the mathematical description of electromagnetic phenomena by naming him a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], and the following year devoting more than fifty pages of the ''Philosophical Transactions'' of the Society to his vector methods and electromagnetic theory. In 1905 Heaviside was given an honorary doctorate by the [[University of Göttingen]].

===Later years and views===
In 1896, FitzGerald and [[John Perry (engineer)|John Perry]] obtained a civil list pension of £120 per year for Heaviside, who was now living in Devon, and persuaded him to accept it, after he had rejected other charitable offers from the Royal Society.{{sfn|Hunt|2004}}

In 1902, Heaviside proposed the existence of what is now known as the [[Kennelly–Heaviside layer]] of the [[ionosphere]]. Heaviside's proposal included means by which radio signals are transmitted around the Earth's curvature. The existence of the ionosphere was confirmed in 1923. The predictions by Heaviside, combined with [[Max Planck|Planck's]] radiation theory, probably discouraged further attempts to detect radio waves from the [[Sun]] and other [[astronomical object]]s. For whatever reason, there seem to have been no attempts for 30 years, until [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Jansky's]] development of [[radio astronomy]] in 1932.

In later years his behavior became quite [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]].  According to associate B. A. Behrend, he became a recluse who was so averse to meeting people that he delivered the manuscripts of his ''Electrician'' papers to a grocery store, where the editors picked them up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

During this time Heaviside would sign letters with the initials "''W.O.R.M.''" after his name. Heaviside also reportedly started painting his fingernails pink and had granite blocks moved into his house for furniture.&lt;ref name=Nahin/&gt;{{rp| xx}} In 1922, he became the first recipient of the [[Faraday Medal]], which was established that year.

On Heaviside's religious views, he was a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], but not a religious one. He was even said to have made fun of people who put their faith in a supreme being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Strange Brains and Genius: The Secret Lives of Eccentric Scientists and Madmen|year=1998|publisher=Plenum Publishing Company Limited|isbn=9780306457845|author=[[Pickover, Clifford A.]] |chapter=Oliver Heaviside|quote=Religion: A Unitarian, but not religious.

[[File:Comparison of before and after the monument restoration.PNG|thumb|Comparison of before and after the restoration project.]]

Heaviside died on 3 February 1925, at [[Torquay]] in [[Devon]] by falling from a ladder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Oliver Heaviside|journal=Journal of the AIEE|date=March 1925|volume=44|issue=3|pages=316–317|doi=10.1109/JAIEE.1925.6537168|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6537168/|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is buried near the eastern corner of [[Paignton]] cemetery. He is buried with his father, Thomas Heaviside (1813–1896) and his mother, Rachel Elizabeth Heaviside. The gravestone was cleaned thanks to an anonymous donor sometime in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oliver Heaviside: Maverick mastermind of electricity|year=2009|publisher=The Institution of Engineering and Technology|isbn=9780863419652|author=[[Mahon, Basil]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his recognition was gained posthumously.

===Heaviside Memorial Project===
In July 2014, academics at [[Newcastle University]], UK and the Newcastle Electromagnetics Interest Group founded the Heaviside Memorial Project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.heavisidememorialproject.co.uk |title=Heaviside Memorial Project Homepage |journal=Nature |volume=165 |issue=4208 |pages=991–3 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=27 July 2014 |publisher=Heaviside Memorial Project |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a bid to fully restore the monument through public subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/Bid-restore-monument/story-21752656-detail/story.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140806033513/http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/Bid-restore-monument/story-21752656-detail/story.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 August 2014 |title=Bid to restore Paignton monument to Oliver Heaviside |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=27 July 2014 |website=www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk |publisher=Herald Express |accessdate=29 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/sage/about/news/item/the-heaviside-memorial-project |title=The Heaviside Memorial Project |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=29 July 2014 |website=www.newcastle.ac.uk |publisher=Newcastle University |accessdate=29 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729185150/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/sage/about/news/item/the-heaviside-memorial-project |archivedate=29 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The restored memorial was ceremonially unveiled on 30 August 2014 by Alan Heather, a distant relative of Heaviside.

===The Heaviside Collection 1872–1923===
A collection of Heaviside's notebooks, papers, correspondence, notes and annotated pamphlets on telegraphy is held at the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET) Archive Centre.&lt;ref&gt;Savoy Hill House 7-10, Savoy Hill, London WC2R 0BU   Email: archives@theiet.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovations and discoveries==
Heaviside did much to develop and advocate [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] methods and the [[vector calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;See especially '''Electromagnetic Theory''', vol.1 chap.3 pp.132-305 where he gave a complete account&lt;/ref&gt;  [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell's]] formulation of [[electromagnetism]] consisted of 20 equations in 20 variables. Heaviside employed the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] and [[divergence]] operators of the [[vector calculus]] to reformulate 12 of these 20 equations into four equations in four variables ('''B''', '''E''', '''J''', and ρ), the form by which they have been known ever since (see [[Maxwell's equations]]). Less well known is that Heaviside's equations and Maxwell's are not exactly the same, and in fact it is easier to modify the latter to make them compatible with quantum physics.&lt;ref&gt;''Topological Foundations of Electromagnetism'', World Scientific Series in Contemporary Chemical Physics, 13 March 2008, Terence W. Barrett.&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of [[gravitational waves]] was also discussed by Heaviside using the analogy between the inverse-square law in gravitation and electricity &lt;ref&gt;A gravitational and electromagnetic analogy,''Electromagnetic Theory'', 1893, 455-466 Appendix B. This was 25 years before Einstein's paper on this subject&lt;/ref&gt;

He invented the [[Heaviside step function]] using it to calculate the [[Electric current|current]] when an [[electric circuit]] is switched on. He was the first to use the unit impulse function now usually known as the [[Dirac delta function]].&lt;ref&gt;'''Electromagnetic Theory''',vol.II, para.271, eqns 54,55&lt;/ref&gt; He invented his [[operational calculus]] method for solving [[linear differential equation]]s. This resembles the currently used [[Laplace transform]] method based on the "Bromwich integral" named after [[Thomas John I'Anson Bromwich|Bromwich]] who devised a rigorous mathematical justification for Heaviside's operator method using contour integration.&lt;ref&gt;See the paper of Jeffreys quoted in the Bromwich WP article&lt;/ref&gt; Heaviside was familiar with the Laplace transform method but considered his own method more direct.&lt;ref&gt;'''Electromagnetic Theory''' vol 3, section starting on p.324. Available online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A rigorous version of Heaviside's operational calculus has been constructed see Mikusinski J: '''The Operational Calculus''', Pergamon Press 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaviside developed the [[transmission line]] theory (also known as the "telegrapher's equations"), which had the effect of increasing the transmission rate over transatlantic cables by a factor of ten. It originally took ten minutes to transmit each character, and this immediately improved to one character per minute. Closely related to this was his discovery that telephone transmission could be greatly improved by placing [[electrical inductance]] in series with the cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wiener |first=Norbert | title = Invention: The Care and 70–75| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3Q2qOtOeLYC| year = 1993| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-73111-8| pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaviside also independently discovered the [[Poynting vector]].&lt;ref name =Nahin/&gt;{{rp|116–118}}

Heaviside advanced the idea that the Earth's uppermost atmosphere contained an ionized layer known as the [[ionosphere]]; in this regard, he predicted the existence of what later was dubbed the [[Kennelly–Heaviside layer]]. In 1947 [[Edward Victor Appleton]] received the Nobel Prize in Physics for proving that this layer really existed.

===Electromagnetic terms===
Heaviside [[neologism|coined]] the following terms of art in [[electromagnetic theory]]:
* [[admittance]] ''(reciprocal of impedance)'' (December 1887);
* [[elastance]] ''(reciprocal of permittance, reciprocal of capacitance)'' (1886);
* [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] ''(real part of admittance, reciprocal of resistance)'' (September 1885);
* [[electret]] for the electric analogue of a permanent magnet, or, in other words, any substance that exhibits a quasi-permanent electric polarization (e.g. [[ferroelectric]]);
* [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] (July 1886);
* [[inductance]] (February 1886);
* [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] (September 1885);
* [[permittance]] and [[permittivity]] (June 1887);
* [[reluctance]] (May 1888);
* [[susceptance]] ''(imaginary part of admittance, reciprocal of reactance)'' (1887).

{{infobox osmium}}
'''Osmium''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὀσμή ''osme'', "smell") is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Os''' and [[atomic number]] 76. It is a hard, brittle, bluish-white [[transition metal]] in the [[platinum group]] that is found as a [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|trace element]] in alloys, mostly in [[platinum]] ores. Osmium is the densest naturally occurring element, with an experimentally measured (using x-ray crystallography) [[density]] of {{val|22.59|u=g/cm3}}. Manufacturers use its [[alloy]]s with platinum, [[iridium]], and other platinum-group metals to make [[fountain pen]] [[Nib (pen)#Nib tipping|nib tipping]], [[electrical contacts]], and in other applications that require extreme durability and [[hardness]].{{sfn|Haynes|2011|p=4.25}} The [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|element's abundance]] in the Earth's crust is among the rarest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1953/0285/report.pdf|title=Recent estimates of the abundances of the elements in the Earth's crust|last=Fleischer|first=Michael|date=1953|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/geology/chapter/reading-abundance-of-elements-in-earths-crust/|title=Reading: Abundance of Elements in Earth's Crust {{!}} Geology|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osmium has a blue-gray tint and is the densest [[stable element]], approximately twice the density of [[lead]]{{sfn|Haynes|2011|p=4.25}} and slightly denser than [[iridium]].&lt;ref name="Densities"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.platinummetalsreview.com/pdf/pmr-v33-i1-014-016.pdf|title=Densities of osmium and iridium: recalculations based upon a review of the latest crystallographic data|author=Arblaster, J.

Osmium is a hard but brittle [[metal]] that remains [[lustrous]] even at high temperatures. It has a very low [[compressibility]]. Correspondingly, its [[bulk modulus]] is extremely high, reported between {{val|395}} and {{val|462|ul=GPa}}, which rivals that of [[diamond]] ({{val|443|u=GPa}}). The hardness of osmium is moderately high at {{val|4|u=GPa}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Osmium Metal Studied under High Pressure and Nonhydrostatic Stress|journal=Phys. Rev.

&lt;!--Common [[oxidation state]]s of osmium are +4 and +3, but oxidation states from +1 to +8 are observed.

Osmium forms compounds with [[oxidation state]]s ranging from −2 to +8. The most common oxidation states are +2, +3, +4, and +8. The +8 oxidation state is notable for being the highest attained by any chemical element aside from iridium's +9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2014/10/iridium-oxide-cation-oxidation-state-9|title=Iridium forms compound in +9 oxidation state|author=Stoye, Emma|date=23 October 2014|publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is encountered only in [[xenon]],&lt;ref name="selig"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Xenon tetroxide – Preparation + Some Properties|journal=Science| date=1964 |volume=143|pages=1322–3| doi=10.1126/science.143.3612.1322|pmid=17799234|issue=3612|jstor=1713238|bibcode=1964Sci...143.1322S|last1=Selig|first1=H.|display-authors=4|last2=Claassen|first2=H.

The most common compound exhibiting the +8 oxidation state is [[osmium tetroxide]]. This toxic compound is formed when powdered osmium is exposed to air. It is a very volatile, water-soluble, pale yellow, crystalline solid with a strong smell. Osmium powder has the characteristic smell of osmium tetroxide.&lt;ref name="mager"/&gt; Osmium tetroxide forms red osmates {{chem|OsO|4|(OH)|2|2-}} upon reaction with a base.

By contrast, [[osmium dioxide]] (OsO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is black, non-volatile, and much less reactive and toxic.

Only two osmium compounds have major applications: osmium tetroxide for [[staining]] tissue in [[electron microscopy]] and for the oxidation of [[alkenes]] in [[organic synthesis]], and the non-volatile osmates for [[Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation|organic oxidation reactions]].&lt;ref name="Bozzola"/&gt;

Osmium pentafluoride (OsF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is known, but osmium trifluoride (OsF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) has not yet been synthesized. The lower oxidation states are stabilized by the larger halogens, so that the trichloride, tribromide, triiodide, and even diiodide are known. The oxidation state +1 is known only for osmium iodide (OsI), whereas several carbonyl complexes of osmium, such as [[triosmium dodecacarbonyl]] ({{chem|Os|3|(CO)|12}}), represent oxidation state 0.&lt;ref name="Holle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="greenwood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenwood|first=N.

J|author2=Levason, W.|doi=10.1016/0010-8545(82)85001-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the lower oxidation states of osmium are stabilized by [[ligand]]s that are good σ-donors (such as [[amines]]) and π-acceptors ([[heterocyclic compound|heterocycles]] containing [[nitrogen]]). The higher oxidation states are stabilized by strong σ- and π-donors, such as {{chem|O|2-}} and {{chem|N|3-}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Sykes, A. G. | title = Advances in Inorganic Chemistry| date = 1992| publisher = Academic Press| isbn = 978-0-12-023637-4| page = 221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its broad range of compounds in numerous oxidation states, osmium in bulk form at ordinary temperatures and pressures resists attack by all acids and alkalis, including [[aqua regia]].&lt;ref name="hunt" /&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of osmium}}
Osmium has seven naturally occurring [[isotope]]s, six of which are stable: {{chem|184|Os}}, {{chem|187|Os}}, {{chem|188|Os}}, {{chem|189|Os}}, {{chem|190|Os}}, and (most abundant) {{chem|192|Os}}. {{chem|186|Os}} undergoes [[alpha decay]] with such a long [[half-life]] {{val|2.0e15|1.1}} years, approximately {{val|140000}} times the [[age of the universe]], that for practical purposes it can be considered stable. Alpha decay is predicted for all seven naturally occurring isotopes, but it has been observed only for {{chem|186|Os}}, presumably due to very long half-lives. It is predicted that {{chem|184|Os}} and {{chem|192|Os}} can undergo [[double beta decay]] but this radioactivity has not been observed yet.&lt;ref name="nubase"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Audi|first=G.|title=The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=729|issue=1|pages=3–128|date=2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A|last2=Bersillon|first2=O.|last3=Blachot|first3=J.|last4=Wapstra|first4=A. H.|url=http://hal.in2p3.fr/in2p3-00014184|citeseerx=10.1.1.692.8504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{chem|187|Os}} is the descendant of {{chem|187|[[rhenium|Re]]}} (half-life {{val|4.56|e=10|u=years}}) and is used extensively in dating terrestrial as well as [[meteorite|meteoric]] [[rock (geology)|rocks]] (see [[rhenium-osmium dating]]). It has also been used to measure the intensity of continental weathering over geologic time and to fix minimum ages for stabilization of the [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] roots of continental [[craton]]s. This decay is a reason why rhenium-rich minerals are abnormally rich in {{chem|187|Os}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Józef|last=Dąbek|author2=Halas, Stanislaw|title=Physical Foundations of Rhenium-Osmium Method – A Review|journal=Geochronometria|volume=27|date=2007|doi=10.2478/v10003-007-0011-4|pages=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most notable application of Os isotopes in geology has been in conjunction with the abundance of iridium, to characterise the layer of [[shocked quartz]] along the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] that marks the extinction of the non-avian [[dinosaur]]s 65 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction|author=Alvarez, L.

==History==
Osmium was discovered in 1803 by [[Smithson Tennant]] and [[William Hyde Wollaston]] in [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Osmium|journal=Metallurgist|volume=18|issue= 2|date=1974|doi=10.1007/BF01132596|pages=155–157|first=S. I.|last=Venetskii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of osmium is intertwined with that of platinum and the other metals of the [[platinum group]]. Platinum reached Europe as ''platina'' ("small silver"), first encountered in the late 17th century in silver mines around the [[Chocó Department]], in [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Platinum of New Granada: Mining and Metallurgy in the Spanish Colonial Empire|author=McDonald, M.|journal=Platinum Metals Review|volume=3|issue=4|date=959|pages=140–145|url=http://www.platinummetalsreview.com/dynamic/article/view/pmr-v3-i4-140-145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery that this metal was not an alloy, but a distinct new element, was published in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Juan, J.|author2=de Ulloa, A.|date=1748|title=Relación histórica del viage a la América Meridional|volume=1|page=606|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uranium]] and osmium were early successful [[catalyst]]s in the [[Haber process]], the [[nitrogen fixation]] reaction of [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] to produce [[ammonia]], giving enough yield to make the process economically successful. At the time, a group at [[BASF]] led by [[Carl Bosch]] bought most of the world's supply of osmium to use as a catalyst. Shortly thereafter, in 1908, cheaper catalysts based on iron and iron oxides were introduced by the same group for the first pilot plants, removing the need for the expensive and rare osmium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Smil| first = Vaclav| title = Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=G9FljcEASycC| date = 2004| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 978-0-262-69313-4| pages = 80–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osmium is one of the even-numbered elements, which puts it in the upper half of [[Abundance of the chemical elements|elements commonly found in space]]. It is, however, the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|least abundant]] stable element in Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]], with an average mass fraction of 50&amp;nbsp;[[parts-per notation|parts per trillion]] in the [[continental crust]].&lt;ref name="wede"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0016-7037(95)00038-2|pages=1217–1232|title=The composition of the continental crust|date=1995|issue=7|author=Wedepohl, Hans K|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=59|bibcode=1995GeCoA..59.1217W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osmium is found in nature as an uncombined element or in natural [[alloy]]s; especially the iridium–osmium alloys, [[osmiridium]] (osmium rich), and [[Osmiridium|iridosmium]] (iridium rich).&lt;ref name="Emsley"&gt;{{cite book| last = Emsley| first = J.| title = Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements| date = 2003| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford, England, UK| isbn = 978-0-19-850340-8| pages = 199–201| chapter = Osmium }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[nickel]] and [[copper]] deposits, the platinum group metals occur as [[sulfide]]s (i.e., (Pt,Pd)S)), [[telluride (chemistry)|tellurides]] (e.g., PtBiTe), [[antimonide]]s (e.g., PdSb), and [[arsenide]]s (e.g., PtAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); in all these compounds platinum is exchanged by a small amount of iridium and osmium.

Within Earth's crust, osmium, like iridium, is found at highest concentrations in three types of geologic structure: igneous deposits (crustal intrusions from below), [[impact crater]]s, and deposits reworked from one of the former structures. The largest known primary reserves are in the [[Bushveld Igneous Complex]] in [[South Africa]],&lt;ref name="kirk-pt"&gt;{{cite book |title=Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology |first = R.

Smaller reserves can be found in the United States.&lt;ref name="kirk-pt" /&gt; The [[alluvial]] deposits used by [[pre-Columbian]] people in the [[Chocó Department]], [[Colombia]] are still a source for platinum group metals. The second large alluvial deposit was found in the [[Ural Mountains]], Russia, which is still mined.&lt;ref name="USGS-YB-2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/platinum/mcs-2008-plati.pdf |publisher=United States Geological Survey USGS|accessdate=2008-09-16|title=Commodity Report: Platinum-Group Metals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Osmium cluster.jpg|thumb|Osmium [[crystal]]s, grown by [[Chemical transport reaction|chemical vapor transport]].]]
Osmium is obtained commercially as a by-product from [[nickel]] and [[copper]] mining and processing. During [[Copper extraction techniques#Electrorefining|electrorefining of copper]] and nickel, noble metals such as silver, gold and the platinum group metals, together with non-metallic elements such as [[selenium]] and [[tellurium]] settle to the bottom of the cell as ''anode mud'', which forms the starting material for their extraction.&lt;ref name="usgs2008-summary"&gt;{{cite journal|author=George, M.

Several methods can achieve this, depending on the separation process and the composition of the mixture. Two representative methods are fusion with [[sodium peroxide]] followed by dissolution in [[aqua regia]], and dissolution in a mixture of [[chlorine]] with [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;ref name="kirk-pt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ullmann-pt"&gt;{{cite book |author=Renner, H. |display-authors=4 |author2=Schlamp, G. |author3=Kleinwächter, I. |author4=Drost, E. |author5=Lüschow, H.

Rhodium can be separated from the residue by treatment with molten [[sodium bisulfate]]. The insoluble residue, containing Ru, Os and Ir, is treated with [[sodium oxide]], in which Ir is insoluble, producing water-soluble Ru and Os salts. After oxidation to the volatile oxides, {{chem|RuO|4}} is separated from {{chem|OsO|4}} by precipitation of (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; with ammonium chloride.

Neither the producers nor the United States Geological Survey published any production amounts for osmium.

==Applications==
Because of the volatility and extreme toxicity of its oxide, osmium is rarely used in its pure state, but is instead often alloyed with other metals for high-wear applications. Osmium alloys such as [[osmiridium]] are very hard and, along with other platinum-group metals, are used in the tips of [[fountain pen]]s, instrument pivots, and electrical contacts, as they can resist wear from frequent operation. They were also used for the tips of [[phonograph]] [[stylus|styli]] during the late 78 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and early "[[LP record|LP]]" and "[[Single (music)|45]]" record era, circa 1945 to 1955. Osmium-alloy tips were significantly more durable than steel and chromium needle points, but wore out far more rapidly than competing, and costlier, [[sapphire]] and [[diamond]] tips, so they were discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Cramer, Stephen D. | author2 = Covino, Bernard S.

[[Osmium tetroxide]] has been used in [[fingerprint]] detection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Use of Hydrogen Fluoride in the Development of Latent Fingerprints Found on Glass Surfaces|first=Herbert L.|last=MacDonell|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science|volume=51|issue=4|date=1960|pages=465–470|jstor=1140672|doi=10.2307/1140672|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4971&amp;context=jclc}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in staining [[fat]]ty tissue for optical and [[electron microscopy]]. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes [[biological membrane]]s in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in [[transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image).&lt;ref name="Bozzola"&gt;{{cite book| author2 = Russell, Lonnie D.| last = Bozzola| first = John J.| title = Electron microscopy : principles and techniques for biologists| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zMkBAPACbEkC&amp;pg=PA21| date = 1999| publisher = Jones and Bartlett| location = Sudbury, Mass.| isbn = 978-0-7637-0192-5| pages = 21–31| chapter = Specimen Preparation for Transmission Electron Microscopy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Chadwick, D.| title = Role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in smooth muscle| date = 2002| publisher = John Wiley and Sons| isbn = 978-0-470-84479-3| pages = 259–264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tetroxide and its derivative  [[potassium osmate]] are important oxidants in [[organic synthesis]]. For the [[Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation]], which uses osmate for the conversion of a [[double bond]] into a [[Vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] [[diol]], [[Karl Barry Sharpless]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kolb|first=H.

In 1898 an Austrian chemist [[Carl Auer von Welsbach|Auer von Welsbach]] developed the Oslamp with a [[Electrical filament|filament]] made of osmium, which he introduced commercially in 1902. After only a few years, osmium was replaced by the more stable metal [[tungsten]]. Tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals, and its use in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of [[incandescent lamp]]s.&lt;ref name="griffith" /&gt;

The light bulb manufacturer [[Osram]] (founded in 1906, when three German companies, Auer-Gesellschaft, AEG and Siemens &amp; Halske, combined their lamp production facilities) derived its name from the elements of '''os'''mium and Wolf'''ram''' (the latter is German for tungsten).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scanning our past from London: the filament lamp and new materials|first=B.|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|date=2001|volume=89|issue=3|pages=413–415|doi=10.1109/5.915382|author=Bowers, B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[palladium]], powdered osmium effectively absorbs hydrogen atoms. This could make osmium a potential candidate for a metal-hydride battery electrode. However, osmium is expensive and would react with potassium hydroxide, the most common battery electrolyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Solubility of Hydrogen in the Platinum Metals under High Pressure|first=V.

Osmium has high [[reflectivity]] in the [[ultraviolet]] range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]; for example, at 600 [[Ångström|Å]] osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1364/AO.24.002959|title=Osmium coated diffraction grating in the Space Shuttle environment: performance|date=1985|author=Torr, Marsha R.|journal=Applied Optics|volume=24|page=2959|pmid=18223987|issue=18|bibcode=1985ApOpt..24.2959T }}&lt;/ref&gt; This high reflectivity is desirable in space-based [[Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy|UV spectrometers]], which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations. Osmium-coated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the [[Space Shuttle]], but it soon became clear that the oxygen radicals in the [[low Earth orbit]] are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1364/AO.24.002660|title=Low earth orbit environmental effects on osmium and related optical thin-film coatings|date=1985|author=Gull, T.

Osmium is usually sold as a minimum 99.9% pure powder. Like other precious metals, it is measured by [[troy weight]] and by [[grams]]. Its price in 2018 is about $1,000 per troy oz, depending on the quantity, its purity and its supplier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://periodic.lanl.gov/76.shtml Osmium].

'''''Pandora's Promise''''' is a 2013 [[documentary film]] about the [[nuclear power debate]], directed by [[Robert Stone (director)|Robert Stone]]. Its central argument is that [[nuclear power]], which still faces historical opposition from [[environmentalist]]s, is a relatively safe and clean energy source which can help [[climate change mitigation|mitigate]] the serious problem of [[anthropogenic global warming]].&lt;ref name=WaPo /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h0sXC00bs6M_Jb4gB85wl-La-P2w |title=Pro-nuclear activists get pulpit at Sundance |last1=Raynaldy |first1=Romain |date=19 Jan 2013 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=IIMbj67Mz9s|title=Pandora's Promise - Q&amp;A at the IFC Center's Stranger Than Fiction Series|link=no}} (Pandora's Promise's channel)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/06/pandora_s_promise_producer_nuclear_energy_is_necessary_to_fight_climate.html |title=Orthodox Environmentalists Don’t Want You to See My Environmental Film |last1=Stone |first1=Robert |date=20 June 2013 |website=[[Slate (magazine)]] |accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title is derived from the ancient [[Greek myth]] of [[Pandora]], who released numerous evils into the world, yet as the movie's [[tagline]] recalls: "At the bottom of [[Pandora's box|the box]] she found hope."

==Reactions==

Reactions to the film have been mixed, if not [[attitude polarization|polarized]]; e.g.:

* [[Kennette Benedict]] from the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] states: "Nuclear power may indeed end up being part of the energy mix that leads to both a more stable climate and adequate livelihoods around the world. But the challenges posed by nuclear power&amp;nbsp;– like the risk of weapons proliferation and reactor accidents, and the need to securely store radioactive used fuel for many generations&amp;nbsp;– are not adequately addressed in the film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thebulletin.org/pandoras-false-promise |title= Pandora's false promise |author= Kennette Benedict  |date=2013-06-10  |work=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Manohla Dargis]] wrote a somewhat critical review.&lt;ref name=Revkin /&gt;
* [[Friends of the Earth Australia]] has (among other groups) denounced the movie as "[[propaganda]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foe.org.au/pandora |title=Pandoras [sic] Promise Propaganda |website=[[Friends of the Earth Australia]] |accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Owen Gleiberman]] lauded it as "radically sane".&lt;ref name=Revkin /&gt;
* [[Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.]] characterized it as an "elaborate [[hoax]]" and a "[[big lie]]".&lt;ref name=Revkin /&gt;
* [[Edwin Lyman]] of the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] was critical of various "less-than-[[half truth]]s".&lt;ref name=Revkin /&gt;
* [[Michael Moore]] discussed the film (among other topics) with director Robert Stone in front of an audience at the [[Traverse City Film Festival]] in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=C5LVLUo8VyA|title=Michael Moore &amp; Robert Stone at The Traverse City Film Festival|link=no}} (Pandora's Promise's channel)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Quiggin]] comments that ''Pandora’s Promise'' presents the environmental rationale for nuclear power, but that reviving nuclear power debates is a distraction, and the main problem with the nuclear option is that it is not economically-viable. Quiggin says that we need more [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and more [[renewable energy commercialization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/08/reviving-nuclear-power-debates-is-a-distraction-we-need-to-use-less-energy |title=Reviving nuclear power debates is a distraction.

* [[Terry Tempest Williams]] stated "this film’s strength was not that it changed my mind, which it did not, but that it expanded it".&lt;ref name=Revkin /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3968">'''Peter L. Hagelstein''' is a principal investigator in the [[Research Laboratory of Electronics]] (RLE) and an associate professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). He received a [[bachelor of science]] and a [[master of science]] degree in 1976, then a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in [[electrical engineering]] in 1981, from MIT. He was a staff member of [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] from 1981 to 1985 before joining the MIT faculty in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1986. 

Hagelstein's early work focused on extreme [[ultraviolet]] and soft [[X-ray laser]]s, relativistic [[atomic structure]] and [[particle collider|electron collision]] [[physics]], [[autoionization]] and dielectronic [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]] processes, [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] population kinetics, [[radiation]] transport and large scale physics simulation. He received the [[Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award]] in 1984 for his innovation and creativity in X-ray laser physics. While working in the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] he pioneered the work that later produced the first X-ray laser, which would later become important for the US [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], popularly referred to as the "Star Wars" program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William J. Broad|title=Star warriors: a penetrating look into the lives of the young scientists behind our space age weaponry|year=1985|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-54566-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 he started investigating [[cold fusion]] (also called ''low-energy nuclear reactions'') with the hope of making a breakthrough similar to the X-ray laser.&lt;ref name=daley2004/&gt; In the period between 1989 and 2004, the field became discredited in the eyes of many scientists.  Due to his involvement, as of 2004 he has not achieved full professorship and he has lost his own laboratory.&lt;ref name=daley2004&gt;{{citation |title= Heating up a cold theory |author= Beth Daley |work= The Boston Globe |date= July 27, 2004 |url= http://www.boston.com/news/globe/health_science/articles/2004/07/27/heating_up_a_cold_theory/ |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His recent efforts have included the invention of [[semiconductor]] technology that could allow efficient, affordable production of electricity from a variety of energy sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Practical Way to Make Power From Wasted Heat|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|date=November 27, 2001|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/27/business/technology-a-practical-way-to-make-power-from-wasted-heat.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/thermoelectric.html|title=Turning heat to electricity|last=Chandler|first=David L.|publisher=[[MIT]]|date=November 18, 2009|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as continuing investigations of low-energy nuclear reactions. Hagelstein is the co-author of a new textbook, ''Introductory Applied Quantum and Statistical Mechanics'', and chaired the Tenth [[International Conference on Cold Fusion]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hecht| first = Jeff | title = Is Cold Fusion Heating Up? | work = Technology Review | publisher = MIT | date = April 23, 2004 | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/13559/page1/| | accessdate = April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polyethylene''' or '''polythene''' (abbreviated '''PE'''; [[IUPAC]] name '''polyethene''' or '''poly(methylene)''') is the most common [[plastic]]. {{As of|2017}}, over 100 million [[tonne]]s of polyethylene resins are produced annually, accounting for 34% of the total plastics market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geyer|first=Roland|last2=Jambeck|first2=Jenna R.|last3=Law|first3=Kara Lavender|date=2017-07-01|title=Production, use, and fate of all plastics ever made|journal=Science Advances|volume=3|issue=7|pages=e1700782|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1700782|pmid=28776036|pmc=5517107|bibcode=2017SciA....3E0782G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.plasticseurope.org/application/files/5715/1717/4180/Plastics_the_facts_2017_FINAL_for_website_one_page.pdf|title=Plastics: The Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=Plastics Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary use is in [[packaging]] ([[plastic bag]]s, [[plastic film]]s, [[geomembranes]], containers including [[bottle]]s, etc.). Many kinds of polyethylene are known, with most having the [[chemical formula]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. PE is usually a mixture of similar [[polymer]]s of [[ethylene]] with various values of ''n''. Polyethylene is a [[thermoplastic]]; however, it can become a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]] [[plastic]] when modified (such as [[cross-linked polyethylene]]).

==History==
Polyethylene was first synthesized by the German chemist [[Hans von Pechmann]], who prepared it by accident in 1898 while investigating [[diazomethane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=von Pechmann, H. |year=1898|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90751n/f312.image.langEN |title=Ueber Diazomethan und Nitrosoacylamine|journal=Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin|volume=31|pages=2640–2646|quote= page 2643: Erwähnt sei noch, dass aus einer ätherischen Diazomethanlösung sich beim Stehen manchmal minimale Quantitäten eines weissen, flockigen, aus Chloroform krystallisirenden Körpers abscheiden; ... (It should be mentioned that from an ether solution of diazomethane, upon standing, sometimes small quantities of a white, flakey substance, which can be crystallized from chloroform, precipitate; ... )}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bamberger claimed that one of his students, Hindermann, had noted the formation of polyethylene in 1897. Eug. Bamberger &amp; Fred. Tschirner (1900) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k907551/f960.image.langEN "Ueber die Einwirkung von Diazomethan auf β-Arylhydroxylamine"] (On the effect of diazomethane on β-arylhydroxylamine), ''Berichte der Deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin'', '''33''': 955–959. From footnote 3 on page 956: "Die Abscheidung weisser Flocken aus Diazomethanlösungen erwähnt auch v. Pechmann (diese Berichte 31, 2643); er hat sie aber wegen Substanzmangel nicht untersucht. Ich hatte übrigens Hrn. v. Pechmann schon einige Zeit vor Erscheinen seiner Publication mitgetheilt, dass aus Diazomethan ein fester, weisser Körper entstehe, der sich bei der Analyse als (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; erwiesen habe, worauf mir Hr. v. Pechmann schrieb, dass er den weissen Körper ebensfalls beobachtet, aber nicht untersucht habe. Zuerst erwähnt ist derselbe in der Dissertation meines Schülers Hindermann, Zürich (1897), S. 120." (Von Pechmann (these ''Reports'', '''31''', 2643) also mentioned the precipitation of white flakes from diazomethane solutions; however, due to a scarcity of the material, he didn't investigate it. Incidentally, some time before the appearance of his publication, I had communicated to Mr. von Pechmann that a solid, white substance arose from diazomethane, which on analysis proved to be (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, whereupon Mr. von Pechmann wrote me that he had likewise observed the white substance, but not investigated it. It is first mentioned in the dissertation of my student Hindermann, Zürich (1897), p. 120.)&lt;/ref&gt; When his colleagues [[Eugen Bamberger]] and [[Friedrich Tschirner]] characterized the white, waxy substance that he had created, they recognized that it contained long &amp;ndash;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;ndash; chains and termed it ''polymethylene''.&lt;ref&gt;Eug. Bamberger &amp; Fred. Tschirner (1900) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k907551/f960.image.langEN "Ueber die Einwirkung von Diazomethan auf β-Arylhydroxylamine"] (On the effect of diazomethane on β-arylhydroxylamine), ''Berichte der Deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin'', '''33''': 955–959. From page 956: "Eine theilweise — übrigens immer nur minimale — Umwandlung des Diazomethans in Stickstoff und Polymethylen vollzieht sich auch bei ganz andersartigen Reactionen; ... " (A partial — incidentally, always only minimal — conversion of diazomethane into nitrogen and polymethylene takes place also during quite different reactions; ... )

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:First polythene pillbox.JPG|thumb|right|A [[pill box (container)|pill box]] presented to a technician at ICI in 1936 made from the first pound of polyethylene]]

The first industrially practical polyethylene synthesis (diazomethane is a notoriously unstable substance that is generally avoided in industrial application) was discovered in 1933 by [[Eric Fawcett]] and [[Reginald Gibson]], again by accident, at the [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) works in [[Northwich]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.thisischeshire.co.uk/2006/8/23/275808.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100121071050/http://archive.thisischeshire.co.uk/2006/8/23/275808.html |archivedate=21 January 2010 |title=Winnington history in the making |date=23 August 2006 |work=This is Cheshire |accessdate=20 February 2014 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon applying extremely high pressure (several hundred [[atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]]) to a mixture of ethylene and [[benzaldehyde]] they again produced a white, waxy material. Because the reaction had been initiated by trace [[oxygen]] contamination in their apparatus, the experiment was, at first, difficult to reproduce. It was not until 1935 that another ICI chemist, [[Michael Perrin]], developed this accident into a reproducible high-pressure synthesis for polyethylene that became the basis for industrial LDPE production beginning in 1939. Because polyethylene was found to have very low-loss properties at very high frequency radio waves, commercial distribution in Britain was suspended on the outbreak of World War II, secrecy imposed, and the new process was used to produce insulation for UHF and SHF [[coaxial cable]]s of [[radar]] sets. During World War II, further research was done on the ICI process and in 1944 Bakelite Corporation at Sabine, Texas, and Du Pont at Charleston, West Virginia, began large-scale commercial production under license from ICI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=July 1949 |title=Poly – The All Star Plastic |work=Popular Mechanics |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GtkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA126 |pages=125–129 |volume=91 |issue=1 |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The breakthrough landmark in the commercial production of polyethylene began with the development of [[catalyst]] that promoted the polymerization at mild temperatures and pressures. The first of these was a [[chromium trioxide]]–based catalyst discovered in 1951 by [[Robert Banks (chemist)|Robert Banks]] and [[J. Paul Hogan]] at [[Phillips Petroleum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Transition Metal Polymerization Catalysts |last1=Hoff |first1=Ray |last2=Mathers |first2=Robert T. |editor1-last=Hoff |editor1-first=Ray |editor2-last=Mathers |editor2-first=Robert T. |year=2010 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-470-13798-7 |doi=10.1002/9780470504437.ch10 |chapter=Chapter 10. Review of Phillips Chromium Catalyst for Ethylene Polymerization}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 the German chemist [[Karl Ziegler]] developed a catalytic system based on [[titanium]] [[halide]]s and organoaluminium compounds that worked at even milder conditions than the Phillips catalyst. The Phillips catalyst is less expensive and easier to work with, however, and both methods are heavily used industrially. By the end of the 1950s both the Phillips- and [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst|Ziegler]]-type catalysts were being used for HDPE production. In the 1970s, the Ziegler system was improved by the incorporation of [[magnesium chloride]].  Catalytic systems based on soluble catalysts, the [[metallocene]]s, were reported in 1976 by [[Walter Kaminsky]] and [[Hansjörg Sinn]]. The Ziegler- and metallocene-based catalysts families have proven to be very flexible at copolymerizing ethylene with other [[olefin]]s and have become the basis for the wide range of polyethylene [[resin]]s available today, including [[Polyethylene#Very-low-density_polyethylene_(VLDPE)|very low density polyethylene]] and [[linear low-density polyethylene]]. Such resins, in the form of [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene#UHMWfiber|UHMWPE fibers]], have (as of 2005) begun to replace [[aramid]]s in many high-strength applications.

==Properties==
The properties of polyethylene can be divided into mechanical, chemical, electrical, optical, and thermal properties.&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Kaiser|first1= Wolfgang|title= Kunststoffchemie für Ingenieure von der Synthese bis zur Anwendung|date=2011|publisher= Hanser|location=München|isbn= 978-3-446-43047-1|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanical properties ===
Polyethylene is of low strength, [[hardness]] and rigidity, but has a high [[ductility]] and [[impact strength]] as well as low friction. It shows strong [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] under persistent force, which can be reduced by addition of short fibers. It feels waxy when touched.

=== Thermal properties ===
The commercial applicability of polyethylene is limited by its comparably low melting point. For common commercial grades of medium- and high-density polyethylene the melting point is typically in the range {{convert|120|to|180|C|F}}. The melting point for average, commercial, low-density polyethylene is typically {{convert|105|to|115|C|F}}. These temperatures vary strongly with the type of polyethylene.

===Chemical properties===
Polyethylene consists of nonpolar, saturated, high molecular weight hydrocarbons. Therefore, its chemical behavior is similar to [[Kerosene|paraffin]]. The individual macromolecules are not [[covalent bond|covalently]] linked. Because of their symmetric molecular structure, they tend to crystallize; overall polyethylene is [[Crystallization of polymers|partially crystalline]]. Higher [[crystallinity]] increases [[density]] and mechanical and chemical stability.

Most [[Low-density polyethylene|LDPE]], [[Medium-density polyethylene|MDPE]], and [[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]] grades have excellent chemical resistance, meaning they are not attacked by strong acids or strong bases, and are resistant to gentle oxidants and reducing agents. Crystalline samples do not dissolve at room temperature. Polyethylene (other than cross-linked polyethylene) usually can be dissolved at elevated temperatures in [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s such as [[toluene]] or [[xylene]], or in chlorinated solvents such as [[trichloroethane]] or [[trichlorobenzene]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Whiteley, Kenneth S.; Heggs, T. Geoffrey; Koch, Hartmut; Mawer, Ralph L. and Immel, Wolfgang (2005) "Polyolefins" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry''. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a21_487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyethylene absorbs almost no [[water]]. The gas and water vapour permeability (only polar gases) is lower than for most plastics; [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[flavorings]] on the other hand can pass it easily.

PE can become brittle when exposed to sunlight, [[carbon black]] is usually used as a UV stabilizer.

Polyethylene burns slowly with a blue flame having a yellow tip and gives off an odour of paraffin (similar to [[candle]] flame). The material continues burning on removal of the flame source and produces a drip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boedeker.com/burntest.htm |title=How to Identify Plastic Materials Using The Burn Test |work=Boedeker Plastics |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyethylene cannot be imprinted or bonded with adheasives without pretreatment. High strength joins are readily achieved with plastic welding.

===Electrical properties===
Polyethylene is a good [[insulator (electricity)|electrical insulator]]. It offers good [[electrical treeing]] resistance; however, it becomes easily [[triboelectric effect|electrostatically charged]] (which can be reduced by additions of [[graphite]], [[carbon black]] or [[antistatic agent]]s).

===Optical properties ===
Depending on thermal history and film thickness PE can vary between almost clear ([[transparency and translucency|transparent]]), milky-opaque ([[translucent]]) or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]. LDPE thereby owns the greatest, LLDPE slightly less and HDPE the least transparency. Transparency is reduced by [[crystallite]]s if they are larger than the wavelength of visible light.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, C. I. (2010)　''Extrusion of Polymers: Theory and Practice''. 2nd ed.. Hanser: Munich.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing process==

===Monomer===

}}
The ingredient or [[monomer]] is [[ethylene]] ([[IUPAC]] name ethene), a [[gas]]eous [[hydrocarbon]] with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which can be viewed as a pair of [[methylene group]]s (–{{chem|CH|2}}–) connected to each other. Typical specifications are &lt;5 ppm for water, oxygen, and other [[alkene]]s. Acceptable contaminants include N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ethane (common precursor to ethylene), and methane. Ethylene is usually produced from petrochemical sources, but also is generated by dehydration of ethanol.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"/&gt;

===Polymerization===
Ethylene is a rather stable molecule that polymerizes only upon contact with catalysts. The conversion is highly [[exothermic]]. [[Coordination polymerization]] is the most pervasive technology, which means that metal chlorides or metal oxides are used. The most common catalysts consist of [[titanium(III) chloride]], the so-called [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst]]s. Another common catalyst is the [[Phillips catalyst]], prepared by depositing [[chromium trioxide|chromium(VI) oxide]] on silica.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"/&gt; Polyethylene can be produced through [[radical polymerization]], but this route has only limited utility and typically requires high-pressure apparatus.

==Joining==
Commonly used methods for joining polyethylene parts together include:&lt;ref name="pdl"&gt;Plastics Design Library (1997). ''Handbook of Plastics Joining: A Practical Guide''. Norwich, New York: Plastics Design Library. p. 326. {{ISBN|1-884207-17-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adhesive]]s and [[solvent]]s are rarely used because polyethylene is [[nonpolar]] and has a high resistance to solvents. [[Pressure-sensitive adhesive]]s (PSA) are feasible if the surface chemistry or charge is modified with [[plasma activation]], [[flame treatment]], or [[corona treatment]].

==Classification==
Polyethylene is classified by its [[density]] and [[Branching (chemistry)|branching]]. Its mechanical properties depend significantly on variables such as the extent and type of branching, the crystal structure, and the [[molecular weight]]. There are several types of polyethylene:

*[[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]] (UHMWPE)
*Ultra-low-molecular-weight polyethylene (ULMWPE or PE-WAX)
*High-molecular-weight polyethylene (HMWPE)
*[[High-density polyethylene]] (HDPE)
*High-density cross-linked polyethylene (HDXLPE)
*[[Cross-linked polyethylene]] (PEX or XLPE)
*[[Medium-density polyethylene]] (MDPE)
*[[Linear low-density polyethylene]] (LLDPE)
*[[Low-density polyethylene]] (LDPE)
*Very-low-density polyethylene (VLDPE)
*[[Chlorinated polyethylene]] (CPE)

With regard to sold volumes, the most important polyethylene grades are HDPE, LLDPE, and LDPE.

Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene in Total Joint Replacement and Medical Devices|edition= 3rd| page=3|isbn=9780323354356 |year=2015|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/C2013-0-16083-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high molecular weight makes it a very [[toughness|tough]] material, but results in less efficient packing of the chains into the [[crystal structure]] as evidenced by densities of less than high-density polyethylene (for example, 0.930–0.935&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). UHMWPE can be made through any catalyst technology, although Ziegler catalysts are most common. Because of its outstanding toughness and its cut, wear, and excellent chemical resistance, UHMWPE is used in a diverse range of applications. These include can- and [[bottle]]-handling machine parts, moving parts on weaving machines, bearings, gears, artificial joints, edge protection on ice rinks, steel cable replacements on ships, and butchers' chopping boards. It is commonly used for the construction of articular portions of [[implant (medicine)|implants]] used for [[hip replacement|hip]] and [[knee replacement]]s. As [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene#UHMWfiber|fiber]], it competes with [[aramid]] in [[bulletproof vests]].

===High-density polyethylene (HDPE)===
{{main|High-density polyethylene}}
[[File:Hdpe pipe installation.jpg|thumb|[[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]] pipe installation in storm drain project in [[Mexico]]]]
HDPE is defined by a density of greater or equal to 0.941&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. HDPE has a low degree of branching. The mostly linear molecules pack together well, so intermolecular forces are stronger than in highly branched polymers. HDPE can be produced by [[chromium]]/silica catalysts, [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst]]s or [[metallocene]] catalysts; by choosing catalysts and reaction conditions, the small amount of branching that does occur can be controlled. These catalysts prefer the formation of [[free radicals]] at the ends of the growing polyethylene molecules. They cause new ethylene monomers to add to the ends of the molecules, rather than along the middle, causing the growth of a linear chain.

HDPE has high tensile strength. It is used in products and packaging such as milk jugs, detergent bottles, butter tubs, garbage containers, and water pipes. One-third of all toys are manufactured from HDPE. In 2007, the global HDPE consumption reached a volume of more than 30 million tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/polyethylene-hdpe/ |title=Market Study: Polyethylene – HDPE |date=May 2012 |publisher=Ceresana Research |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-linked polyethylene (PEX or XLPE)===
{{Main|Cross-linked polyethylene}}
PEX is a medium- to high-density polyethylene containing [[cross-link]] bonds introduced into the polymer structure, changing the thermoplastic into a [[thermoset]]. The high-temperature properties of the polymer are improved, its flow is reduced, and its chemical resistance is enhanced. PEX is used in some potable-water plumbing systems because tubes made of the material can be expanded to fit over a metal nipple and it will slowly return to its original shape, forming a permanent, water-tight connection.

===Medium-density polyethylene (MDPE)===
{{Main|Medium-density polyethylene}}
MDPE is defined by a density range of 0.926–0.940&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. MDPE can be produced by chromium/silica catalysts, Ziegler-Natta catalysts, or metallocene catalysts. MDPE has good shock and drop resistance properties. It also is less notch-sensitive than HDPE; stress-cracking resistance is better than HDPE. MDPE is typically used in gas pipes and fittings, sacks, shrink film, packaging film, carrier bags, and screw closures.

===Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE)===
{{Main|Linear low-density polyethylene}}
LLDPE is defined by a density range of 0.915–0.925&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. LLDPE is a substantially linear polymer with significant numbers of short branches, commonly made by [[copolymerization]] of ethylene with short-chain [[alpha-olefin]]s (for example, [[1-butene]], [[1-hexene]], and [[1-octene]]). LLDPE has higher tensile strength than LDPE, and it exhibits higher impact and [[puncture resistance]] than LDPE. Lower thickness (gauge) films can be blown, compared with LDPE, with better environmental stress-cracking resistance, but is not as easy to process. LLDPE is used in packaging, particularly film for bags and sheets. Lower thickness may be used compared to LDPE. It is used for cable coverings, toys, lids, buckets, containers, and pipe. While other applications are available, LLDPE is used predominantly in film applications due to its toughness, flexibility, and relative transparency. Product examples range from agricultural films, Saran wrap, and bubble wrap, to multilayer and composite films. In 2013, the world LLDPE market reached a volume of US$40 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/polyethylene-lldpe/ |title=Market Study: Polyethylene – LLDPE 2nd. edition |date=November 2014 |publisher=Ceresana |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low-density polyethylene (LDPE)===
{{Main|Low-density polyethylene}}
LDPE is defined by a density range of 0.910–0.940&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. LDPE has a high degree of short- and long-chain branching, which means that the chains do not pack into the [[crystal structure]] as well. It has, therefore, less strong intermolecular forces as the [[instantaneous-dipole induced-dipole attraction]] is less. This results in a lower [[tensile strength]] and increased [[ductility]]. LDPE is created by [[Radical polymerization|free-radical polymerization]]. The high degree of branching with long chains gives molten LDPE unique and desirable flow properties. LDPE is used for both rigid containers and plastic film applications such as plastic bags and film wrap. In 2013, the global LDPE market had a volume of almost US$33 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/polyethylene-ldpe/ |title=Market Study: Polyethylene – LDPE (2nd edition) |date=October 2014 |publisher=Ceresana |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radical polymerization process used to make LDPE does not include a catalyst that "supervises" the radical sites on the growing PE chains. (In HDPE synthesis, the radical sites are at the ends of the PE chains, because the catalyst stabilizes their formation at the ends.) Secondary [[free radical|radicals]] (in the middle of a chain) are more stable than primary radicals (at the end of the chain), and tertiary radicals (at a branch point) are more stable yet. Each time an ethylene monomer is added, it creates a primary radical, but often these will rearrange to form more stable secondary or tertiary radicals. Addition of ethylene monomers to the secondary or tertiary sites creates branching.

===Very-low-density polyethylene (VLDPE)===
VLDPE is defined by a density range of 0.880–0.915&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. VLDPE is a substantially linear polymer with high levels of short-chain branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with short-chain alpha-olefins (for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene). VLDPE is most commonly produced using metallocene catalysts due to the greater co-monomer incorporation exhibited by these catalysts. VLDPEs are used for hose and tubing, ice and frozen food bags, food packaging and stretch wrap as well as impact modifiers when blended with other polymers.

Recently, much research activity has focused on the nature and distribution of long chain branches in polyethylene. In HDPE, a relatively small number of these branches, perhaps one in 100 or 1,000 branches per backbone carbon, can significantly affect the [[rheology|rheological]] properties of the polymer.

===Copolymers===
In addition to [[copolymerization]] with alpha-olefins, ethylene can also be the copolymerized with a wide range of other monomers and ionic composition that creates ionized free radicals. Common examples include [[vinyl acetate]] (the resulting product is [[ethylene-vinyl acetate]] copolymer, or EVA, widely used in athletic-shoe sole foams) and a variety of [[acrylate]]s. Applications of [[Acrylic resin|acrylic]] [[copolymer]] include packaging and sporting goods, and [[superplasticizer]], used for cement production.

=== Molecular structure of different PE types ===
The diverse material behavior of different types of polyethylene can be explained by their molecular structure. Molecular weight and crystallinity are having the biggest impact, the crystallinity in turn depends on molecular weight and degree of branching. The less the polymer chains are branched, and the smaller the molecular weight, the higher the crystallinity of polyethylene. The crystallinity is between 35% (PE-LD/PE-LLD) and 80% (PE-HD). Within crystallites polyethylene has a density of 1.0&amp;nbsp;g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, in the amorphous regions of 0.86&amp;nbsp;g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, an almost linear relationship exists between density and crystallinity.&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;

The degree of branching of the different types of polyethylene can be schematically represented as follows:&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| PE-HD || [[File:PE-HD schematic.svg|Schematic representation of PE-HD (high-density polyethylene).]]

|}

&lt;small&gt;The figure shows polyethylene backbones, short-chain branches and side chain branches. The polymer chains are represented linearly.&lt;/small&gt;

=== Chain branches ===
The properties of polyethylene are highly dependent on type and number of chain branches. The chain branches in turn depend on the process used: either the high-pressure process (only PE-LD) or the low-pressure process (all other PE grades). Low-density polyethylene is produced by the high-pressure process by radical polymerization, thereby numerous short chain branches as well as long chain branches are formed. Short chain branches are formed by [[intramolecular]] [[chain transfer]] reactions, they are always [[butyl group|butyl]] or [[ethyl group|ethyl]] chain branches because the reaction proceeds after the following mechanism:
:[[File:PE-LD mechanism en.svg|Mechanism for the emergence of side chains during synthesis of polyethylene (PE-LD).]]

==Environmental issues==
{{expand section|date=August 2018}}
[[File:Polyethylene.jpg|thumb|140|A recyclable bag manufactured from polyethylene]]

{{See also|Plastic pollution}}

Polyethylene is produced from ethylene, and although ethylene can be produced from [[renewable resources]], it is mainly obtained from [[petroleum]] or [[natural gas]].

Moreover, the widespread usage of polyethylene poses difficulties for [[waste management]] if it is not recycled. Polyethylene is not readily biodegradable, and thus accumulates in [[landfills]]. Incineration may result in harmful [[Incineration#Gaseous emissions|gaseous emissions]].

In Japan, getting rid of plastics in an environmentally friendly way was the major problem discussed until the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]] in 2011 became a larger issue. It was listed as a $90 billion market for solutions. Since 2008, Japan has rapidly increased the recycling of plastics, but still has a large amount of plastic wrapping which goes to waste.&lt;ref name="prideaux2007"&gt;{{cite news|title=Plastic incineration rise draws ire|first=Eric |last=Prideaux |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20071103f2.html |newspaper=Japan Times |date=3 November 2007 |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122082604/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20071103f2.html |archivedate=22 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a Japanese researcher, Akinori Ito, released the prototype of a machine which creates oil from polyethylene using a small, self-contained vapor distillation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/thinking-tech/new-invention-turns-plastic-bags-into-oil/6295 |date=17 February 2011 |title=New invention turns plastic bags into oil |first=Tuan |last=Nguyen |publisher=smartplanet.com |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodegradability===

Polyethylene is not readily biodegradable, and thus accumulates in landfills. However, there are a number of species of bacteria and animals that are able to degrade polyethylene.

In May 2008, Daniel Burd, a 16-year-old Canadian, won the [[Canada-Wide Science Fair]] in Ottawa after discovering that ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'', with the help of ''[[Sphingomonas]]'', can degrade over 40% of the weight of plastic bags in less than three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://woohooreport.com/2009/09/wci-student-isolates-microbe-that-lunches-on-plastic-bags/|publisher=The Record.com|title=CanadaWorld – WCI student isolates microbe that lunches on plastic bags|accessdate=2014-02-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718081923/http://woohooreport.com/2009/09/wci-student-isolates-microbe-that-lunches-on-plastic-bags/|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thermophilic bacterium ''[[Brevibacillus borstelensis]]'' (strain 707) was isolated from a soil sample and found to use low-density polyethylene as a sole carbon source when incubated together at 50&amp;nbsp;°C. Biodegradation increased with time exposed to [[ultraviolet]] radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=15836478 |journal=Journal of Applied Microbiology |last=Hadad |first=D. |last2=Geresh |first2=S. |last3=Sivan |first3=A. |title=Biodegradation of polyethylene by the thermophilic bacterium ''Brevibacillus borstelensis'' |year=2005 |volume=98 |issue=5 |pages=1093–1100 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2672.2005.02553.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Acinetobacter]]'' sp. 351 can degrade lower molecular-weight PE oligomers. When PE is subjected to thermo- and photo-oxidization, products including alkanes, alkenes, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, carboxylic acid, keto-acids, dicarboxylic acids, lactones, and esters are released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|first=Yutaka |last=Tokiwa |first2=Buenaventurada P. |last2=Calabia |first3=Charles U. |last3=Ugwu |first4=Seiichi |last4=Aiba |title=Biodegradability of Plastics |pages=3722–3742 |date=September 2009 |volume=10 |issue=9 |pmc=2769161 |pmid=19865515 |doi=10.3390/ijms10093722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a Chinese researcher discovered that [[Indian mealmoth]] larvae could metabolize polyethylene from observing that plastic bags at his home had small holes in them. Deducing that the hungry larvae must have digested the plastic somehow, he and his team analyzed their gut bacteria and found a few that could use plastic as their only carbon source. Not only could the bacteria from the guts of the ''Plodia interpunctella'' moth larvae metabolize polyethylene, they degraded it significantly, dropping its tensile strength by 50%, its mass by 10% and the molecular weights of its polymeric chains by 13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondriest.com/news/discovery-plastic-eating-bacteria-may-speed-waste-reduction.htm |date=27 January 2015 |title=Discovery of plastic-eating bacteria may speed waste reduction |first=Lori |last=Balster |publisher=fondriest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/es504038a |pmid=25384056 |title=Evidence of Polyethylene Biodegradation by Bacterial Strains from the Guts of Plastic-Eating Waxworms |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=48 |issue=23 |pages=13776–84 |year=2014 |last1=Yang |first1=Jun |last2=Yang |first2=Yu |last3=Wu |first3=Wei-Min |last4=Zhao |first4=Jiao |last5=Jiang |first5=Lei |bibcode=2014EnST...4813776Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, researchers reported that the caterpillar of ''[[Galleria mellonella]]'' eats [[Plastic pollution|plastic garbage]] such as polyethylene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/forscherin-entdeckt-zufaellig-plastik-fressende-raupe-a-1144619.html |author=| title=Forscherin entdeckt zufällig Plastik-fressende Raupe| publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]| language=German |date=April 24, 2017 |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''BBC News''|author=Briggs, Helen |title=Plastic-eating caterpillar could munch waste, scientists say|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-39694553|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemically modified polyethylene ==
Polyethylene may either be modified in the polymerization by [[Chemical polarity|polar]] or non-polar [[comonomer]]s or after polymerization through polymer-analogous reactions. Common polymer-analogous reactions are in case of polyethylene [[Cross-link|crosslinking]], [[Chlorination reaction|chlorination]] and [[sulfochlorination]].

=== Non-polar ethylene copolymers ===

==== α-olefins ====
In the low pressure process [[Alpha-olefin|α-olefins]] (e.g. [[1-Butene|1-butene]] or [[1-Hexene|1-hexene]]) may be added, which are incorporated in the polymer chain during polymerization. These copolymers introduce short side chains, thus [[crystallinity]] and [[density]] are reduced. As explained above, mechanical and thermal properties are changed thereby. In particular, PE-LLD is produced this way.

==== Metallocene polyethylene (PE-MC) ====
Metallocene polyethylene (PE-M) is prepared by means of [[metallocene catalysts]], usually including copolymers (z. B. ethene / hexene). Metallocene polyethylene has a relatively narrow [[molecular weight distribution]], exceptionally high toughness, excellent optical properties and a uniform comonomer content. Because of the narrow molecular weight distribution it behaves less pseudoplastic (especially under larger shear rates). Metallocene polyethylene has a low proportion of low molecular weight (extractable) components and a low welding and sealing temperature. Thus, it is particularly suitable for the food industry.&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;{{rp|238}}&lt;ref name="Vasile"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pascu|first1=Cornelia Vasile: Mihaela|title=Practical guide to polyethylene|date=2005|publisher=Rapra Technology Ltd.|location=Shawbury|isbn=978-1859574935|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}}

====Polyethylene with multimodal molecular weight distribution====
Polyethylene with multimodal molecular weight distribution consists of several polymer fractions, which are homogeneously mixed. Such polyethylene types offer extremely high stiffness, toughness, strength, stress crack resistance and an increased crack propagation resistance. They consist of equal proportions higher and lower molecular polymer fractions. The lower molecular weight units crystallize easier and relax faster. The higher molecular weight fractions form linking molecules between crystallites, thereby increasing toughness and stress crack resistance. Polyethylene with multimodal molecular weight distribution can be prepared either in two-stage reactors, by catalysts with two different active centers on a carrier or by blending in extruders.&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;{{rp|238}}

==== Cyclic olefin copolymers (COC) ====
[[Cyclic olefin copolymer]]s are prepared by copolymerization of ethene and [[cycloolefin]]s (usually [[norbornene]]) produced by using metallocene catalysts. The resulting polymers are amorphous polymers and particularly transparent and heat resistant.&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;{{rp|239}}&lt;ref name="Vasile" /&gt;{{rp|27}}

=== Polar ethylene copolymers ===
The basic compounds used as polar comonomers are vinyl alcohol ([[Vinyl alcohol|Ethenol]], an unsaturated alcohol), acrylic acid ([[propenoic acid]], an unsaturated acid) and [[ester]]s containing one of the two compounds.

==== Ethylene copolymers with unsaturated alcohols ====
Ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) is (formally) a copolymer of PE and vinyl alcohol (ethenol), which is prepared by (partial) hydrolysis of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (as vinyl alcohol itself is not stable). However, typically EVOH has a higher comonomer content than the VAC commonly used.&lt;ref name="Domininghaus"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elsner |first1=Peter|last2=Eyerer |first2=Peter|last3=Hirth|first3=Thomas|title=Domininghaus - Kunststoffe|date=2012 |publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin Heidelberg |isbn=978-3-642-16173-5|edition=8. |page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|239}}

EVOH is used in multilayer films for packaging as a barrier layer (barrier plastic). As EVOH is hygroscopic (water-attracting), it absorbs water from the environment, whereby it loses its barrier effect. Therefore, it must be used as a core layer surrounded by other plastics (like LDPE, PP, PA or PET). EVOH is also used as a coating agent against corrosion at street lights, traffic light poles and noise protection walls.&lt;ref name="Domininghaus" /&gt;{{rp|239}}

==== Ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers (EAA)  ====
Copolymer of ethylene and unsaturated carboxylic acids (such as acrylic acid) are characterized by good adhesion to different materials, by resistance to stress cracking and high flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elsner, Peter; Eyerer, Peter and Hirth, Thomas |title=Kunststoffe Eigenschaften und Anwendungen |date=2012|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-16173-5 |edition=8.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are more sensitive to heat and oxidation than ethylene homopolymers. Ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers are used as [[adhesion promoter]]s.&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;

If salts of an unsaturated carboxylic acid are present in the polymer, thermo-reversible ion networks are formed, they are called [[ionomer]]s. Ionomers are highly transparent thermoplastics which are characterized by high adhesion to metals, high abrasion resistance and high water absorption.&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;

=== Ethylene copolymers with unsaturated esters ===
If unsaturated esters are copolymerized with ethylene, either the alcohol moiety may be in the polymer backbone (as it is the case in ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer) or of the acid moiety (e. g. in ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer). [[Ethylene-vinyl acetate]] copolymers are prepared similarly to LD-PE by high pressure polymerization. The proportion of comonomer has a decisive influence on the behaviour of the polymer.

The density decreases up to a comonomer share of 10% because of the disturbed crystal formation. With higher proportions it approaches to the one of [[polyvinyl acetate]] (1.17 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Domininghaus" /&gt;{{rp|235}} Due to decreasing crystallinity ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are getting softer with increasing comonomer content. The polar side groups change the chemical properties significantly (compared to polyethylene):&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;{{rp|224}} weather resistance, adhesiveness and weldability rise with comonomer content, while the chemical resistance decreases. Also mechanical properties are changed: stress cracking resistance and toughness in the cold rise, whereas yield stress and heat resistance decrease. With a very high proportion of comonomers (about 50%) rubbery thermoplastics are produced ([[thermoplastic elastomer]]s).&lt;ref name="Domininghaus" /&gt;{{rp|235}}

Ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymers behave similarly to ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers.&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;{{rp|240}}

=== Crosslinking ===
{{Main|Cross-linked polyethylene}}
A basic distinction is made between peroxide crosslinking (PE-Xa), silane crosslinking (PE-Xb), electron beam crosslinking (PE-Xc) and azo crosslinking (PE-Xd).&lt;ref name="Saechtling"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baur|first1=Erwin |last2=Osswald|first2=Tim A. |title=Saechtling Kunststoff Taschenbuch |date=October 2013|isbn=978-3-446-43729-6 |page=443}} [https://www.kunststoffe.de/themen/basics/standardthermoplaste/polyethylen-pe/artikel/vernetztes-polyethylen-pe-x-820007.html Vorschau auf kunststoffe.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crosslinking PE scheme en.svg|frameless|upright=2.5|Shown are the peroxide, the silane and irradiation crosslinking]]

&lt;small&gt;Shown are the peroxide, the silane and irradiation crosslinking. In each method, a radical is generated in the polyethylene chain (top center), either by radiation (h·ν) or by peroxides (R-O-O-R). Then, two radical chains can either directly crosslink (bottom left) or indirectly by silane compounds (bottom right).&lt;/small&gt;

*'''Peroxide crosslinking (PE-Xa)''': The crosslinking of polyethylene using [[peroxide]]s (e. g. [[dicumyl peroxide|dicumyl]] or [[di-tert-butyl peroxide]]) is still of major importance. In the so-called ''Engel process'', a mixture of HDPE and 2 %&lt;ref name="Ullmanns"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Whiteley |first1=Kenneth S.|title=Polyethylene |journal=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |doi=10.1002/14356007.a21_487.pub2|year=2011|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt; peroxide is at first mixed at low temperatures in an extruder and then crosslinked at high temperatures (between 200 and 250&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name="Saechtling" /&gt; The peroxide [[Radical initiator#Major types of initiation reaction|decomposes to peroxide radicals]] (RO•), which abstract (remove) hydrogen atoms from the polymer chain, leading to [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]]. When these combine, a crosslinked network is formed.&lt;ref name="Koltzenburg"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Koltzenburg|first1=Sebastian |last2=Maskos|first2=Michael|last3=Nuyken |first3=Oskar|title=Polymere: Synthese, Eigenschaften und Anwendungen |date=2014|publisher=Springer Spektrum |isbn=978-3-642-34773-3|page=406|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting polymer network is uniform, of low tension and high flexibility, whereby it is softer and tougher than (the irradiated) PE-Xc.&lt;ref name="Saechtling" /&gt;
*'''Silane crosslinking (PE-Xb)''': In the presence of [[silanes]] (e.g. [[trimethoxyvinylsilane]]) polyethylene can initially be Si-[[Functionality (chemistry)|functionalized]] by irradiation or by a small amount of a peroxide. Later Si-OH groups can be formed in a [[Laboratory water bath|water bath]] by [[hydrolysis]], which condense then and crosslink the PE by the formation of Si-O-Si bridges. [16] [[Catalyst]]s such as [[dibutyltin dilaurate]] may accelerate the reaction.&lt;ref name="Ullmanns" /&gt;
*'''Irradiation crosslinking (PE-Xc)''': The crosslinking of polyethylene is also possible by a downstream radiation source (usually an [[electron accelerator]], occasionally a [[isotopic radiator]]). PE products are crosslinked below the crystalline melting point by splitting off [[hydrogen]] atoms. [[β-radiation]] possesses a [[penetration depth]] of 10 [[Millimetre|mm]], [[Gamma ray|ɣ-radiation]] 100&amp;nbsp;mm. Thereby the interior or specific areas can be excluded from the crosslinking.&lt;ref name="Saechtling" /&gt; However, due to high capital and operating costs radiation crosslinking plays only a minor role compared with the peroxide crosslinking.&lt;ref name="Domininghaus" /&gt; In contrast to peroxide crosslinking, the process is carried out in the [[solid-state chemistry|solid state]]. Thereby, the cross-linking takes place primarily in the amorphous regions, while the crystallinity remains largely intact.&lt;ref name="Ullmanns" /&gt;
*'''Azo crosslinking (PE-Xd)''': In the so-called ''Lubonyl process'' polyethylene is crosslinked preadded [[azo compound]]s after extrusion in a hot salt bath.&lt;ref name="Domininghaus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saechtling" /&gt;

===Chlorination and sulfochlorination===
[[Chlorinated Polyethylene]] (PE-C) is an inexpensive material having a chlorine content from 34 to 44%. It is used in blends with [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] because the soft, rubbery chloropolyethylene is embedded in the PVC matrix, thereby increasing the [[impact resistance]]. In addition, it also increases the weather resistance. Furthermore, it is used for softening PVC foils, without risking the migrate of plasticizers. Chlorinated polyethylene can be crosslinked peroxidically to form an elastomer which is used in cable and rubber industry.&lt;ref name="Domininghaus" /&gt; When chlorinated polyethylene is added to other polyolefins, it reduces the flammability.&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;{{rp|245}}

Chlorosulfonated PE (CSM) is used as starting material for ozone resistant [[synthetic rubber]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemgapedia.de/vsengine/vlu/vsc/de/ch/9/mac/andere/kautschuk/kautschuk.vlu/Page/vsc/de/ch/9/mac/andere/kautschuk/chlorsulfon.vscml.html Chlorsulfoniertes Polyethylen (CSM)].

===Bio-based polyethylene===

[[Braskem]] and [[Toyota Tsusho Corporation]] started joint marketing activities to produce polyethylene from [[sugarcane]]. Braskem will build a new facility at their existing industrial unit in [[Triunfo, Rio Grande do Sul|Triunfo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil]] with an annual production capacity of {{convert|200000|ST|kg}}, and will produce high-density and low-density polyethylene from [[bioethanol]] derived from sugarcane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.yourindustrynews.com/blog/?p=2390 |title=Braskem &amp; Toyota Tsusho start joint marketing activities for green polyethylene from sugar cane |publisher=yourindustrynews.com |date=26 September 2008 |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyethylene can also be made from other feedstocks, including [[wheat grain]] and [[sugar beet]]. These developments are using renewable resources rather than fossil fuel, although the issue of plastic source is currently negligible in the wake of [[plastic pollution|plastic waste]] and in particular polyethylene waste as shown above.

==Nomenclature and general description of the process==
The name polyethylene comes from the ingredient and not the resulting chemical compound, which contains no double bonds. The scientific name ''polyethene'' is systematically derived from the scientific name of the monomer.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kahovec"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac200274101921|title=Nomenclature of regular single-strand organic polymers (IUPAC Recommendations 2002)|year=2002|last1=Kahovec|first1=J.|last2=Fox|first2=R. B.|last3=Hatada|first3=K.|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=74|page=1921|ref=harv|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alkene monomer converts to a long, sometimes ''very'' long, alkane in the polymerization process.&lt;ref name="Kahovec" /&gt; In certain circumstances it is useful to use a structure-based nomenclature; in such cases [[IUPAC]] recommends poly(methylene) (poly(methanediyl) is a non-preferred alternative).&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_683.htm |title=A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds (Recommendations 1993) IUPAC, Commission on Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry |year=1993 |publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications |isbn=978-0632037025 |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in names between the two systems is due to the ''opening up'' of the monomer's double bond upon polymerization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://old.iupac.org/reports/provisional/abstract04/favre_310305.html |title=IUPAC Provisional Recommendations on the ''Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry'' |date=27 October 2004 |publisher=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is abbreviated to ''PE''. In a similar manner [[polypropylene]] and [[polystyrene]] are shortened to PP and PS, respectively. In the United Kingdom and India the polymer is commonly called ''polythene'', from the ICI [[trademark|trade name]], although this is not recognized scientifically.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22491">As part of a concerted effort worldwide to [[Energy conservation|reduce energy consumption]], CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and the impact of industrial operations on the environment, various regulatory authorities in many countries have introduced, or are planning, legislation to encourage the manufacture and use of higher efficiency [[Engine|motors]]. This article looks at the development of the '''premium efficiency''' standard (IE3) and premium [[Mechanical efficiency|efficiency]] motors (PEMs) and associated environmental, [[Environmental law|legal]] and energy-related topics.

==History==
The [[1979 energy crisis|oil crisis]] and the worldwide need for more power and consequently more [[power station]]s have raised [[energy conservation]] awareness.

In 1992 the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], as part of the [[Energy Policy Act of 1992|Energy Policy Act]] (EPAct) set minimum efficiency levels (see Table B-1){{Vague|date=May 2015}} for [[electric motor]]s.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aceee.org/Motors/epactapp.htm |title=Energy Efficiency Topics |publisher=ACEEE |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the European Committee of Manufacturers of Electrical Machines and Power systems (CEMEP) issued a voluntary agreement of motor manufacturers on efficiency classification, with three efficiency classes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.induteq.nl/bestanden/masterclass/w33/motors-abc-en.pdf#page=18 |title=Siemens ABC of motors, pag.18 |publisher=Siemens |date=2009 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eff 1 for High Efficiency
* Eff 2 for Standard Efficiency
* Eff 3 for Low Efficiency

==Premium efficiency electrical motors==
The term “Premium efficiency” as discussed here relates to a class of motor efficiency. It is thought necessary to introduce this term associated with motors because of forthcoming legislation in [[European Union|the EU]], USA and other countries regarding the future mandatory use of premium-efficiency [[Squirrel-cage_rotor|squirrel cage]] induction type motors in defined equipment.

==Reducing energy consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions==
Several statements have been made regarding motor use and the advantages of using premium-efficiency or higher efficiency motors. These include:

Based on [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] data, it is estimated that the [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] (NEMA) premium-efficiency motor program would save 5.8&amp;nbsp;[[terawatt]]s of electricity and prevent the release of nearly 80 million metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere over the next ten years. This is equivalent to keeping 16&amp;nbsp;million cars off the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nema.org/gov/energy/efficiency/premium |accessdate=September 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221083647/http://nema.org/gov/energy/efficiency/premium/ |archivedate=February 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roughly 30 million new electric motors are sold each year for industrial purposes. Some 300 million motors are in use in industry, infrastructure and large buildings. These electric motors are responsible for 40% of global electricity used to drive pumps, fans, compressors and other mechanical traction equipment. Motor technology has evolved over the last few decades. Superior so-called "premium" products are now available, ready to change the market toward [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and to contribute in lowering [[greenhouse gas]] emissions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardo-energy.org/ |title=The Global Community for Sustainable Energy Professionals |publisher=Leonardo ENERGY |date= |accessdate=2015-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With using [[best practice]] energy efficiency of electrical motors can be improved by 20% to 30% on average. Most improvements have a pay back time of 1 to below 3 years. This in addition means a big potential impact on reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsystems.org/ |title=IEA 4E - Electric Motor Systems Annex - EMSA |publisher=Motorsystems.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric motor systems consume large amounts of [[electrical energy]] and can provide an opportunity for significant energy savings. Energy represents more than 97 percent of total motor operating costs over the motor’s lifetime. However, the purchase of a new motor often tends to be driven by the price, not the electricity it will consume. Even a small improvement in efficiency could result in significant energy and cost savings. Investing a little more money upfront for a more efficient motor is often paid back in energy savings. Improving energy efficiency reduces greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/Publications/commercial/pdf/M144-21-2003E.pdf |accessdate=October 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706182440/http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/Publications/commercial/pdf/M144-21-2003E.pdf |archivedate=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of motor efficiency==
The efficiency of an electric motor is defined as the ratio of usable shaft power to electric input power.

'''''&lt;sup&gt;η&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;mot&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;shaft&lt;/sub&gt; ÷ &lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'''''

'''''&lt;sup&gt;η&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;mot&lt;/sub&gt;'''''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;= motor efficiency [%]

'''''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;shaft&lt;/sub&gt;'''''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;= shaft Power [kW] ( in USA HP with factor 1.34)

'''''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'''''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;= electrical input from [[power supply]] [kW]

The shaft power is transferred to the machine driven; the electric input power is what is metered and charged for. Loss in motor efficiency is determined by the difference between the input power and output or shaft power.

'''''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; - &lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;shaft&lt;/sub&gt;'''''

'''''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = losses of electric motor [kW]

Motor [[Losses in electrical systems|energy loss]] is mainly heat caused by many factors, including loss from the coil winding (resistance), loss in the rotor bars and [[slip ring]]s, loss due to magnetising of the [[iron]] core, and loss from friction of bearings.

==Premium efficiency motor programs in USA==
[[File:Nema logo.png|thumb|NEMA logo]]
On December 19, 2007, President Bush signed the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] (EISA) into law (Public Law 140-110). The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) actively participated in crafting major provisions on EISA. A critical provision that NEMA focused on was increased motor efficiency levels. The Motor Generator section of NEMA joined forces with the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy to draft and recommend new motor efficiency regulations covering both general purpose and some categories of definite and special purpose electrical motors.

The Motor and Generator Section of NEMA established the NEMA Premium program for four main reasons:
* Electric motors have a significant impact on the total energy operating cost for industrial, institutional and commercial buildings.
* Electric motors vary in terms of energy efficiency. The NEMA Premium program will assist purchasers identify higher efficient motors that will save them money and improve system reliability.
* NEMA Premium labeled electric motors will assist users to optimize motor systems efficiency in light of power supply and utility deregulation issues.
* NEMA Premium motors and optimized systems will reduce electrical consumption thereby reducing pollution associated with [[Electricity generation|electrical power generation]].

A summary of EISA standards for motors:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nema.org/media/pr/20080327a.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916174037/http://www.nema.org/media/pr/20080327a.cfm |date=September 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EU approach to premium efficiency motors==
In June, 2005, the European Union enacted a [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] on establishing a framework for setting [[Sustainable design|Eco-design]] requirements (such as energy efficiency requirements) for all energy using products in the residential, tertiary and industrial sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.iec.ch |title=Welcome to the IEC - International Electrotechnical Commission |publisher=Iec.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coherent EU-wide rules for eco-design will ensure that disparities among national regulations do not become obstacles to intra-EU trade. The directive does not introduce directly binding requirements for specific products, but does define conditions and criteria for setting requirements regarding environmentally relevant product characteristics (such as energy consumption) and allows them to be improved quickly and efficiently. It will be followed by implementing measures which will establish the eco-design requirements. In principle, the Directive applies to all energy using products (except transport vehicles) and covers all energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managenergy.net/products/R535.htm |title=Supporting local and regional sustainable actions |publisher=ManagEnergy |date= |accessdate=2015-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unifying worldwide efficiency classifications==
[[IEC 60034-30]] specifies [[electrical efficiency]] classes for single-speed, [[three-phase]], 50&amp;nbsp;Hz and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, [[cage-induction motor]]s that:
* have 2, 4, or 6 poles (3,000; 1,500; and 1,000 RPM at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz)
* have rated output between 0.75 and 375&amp;nbsp;kW
* have a rated voltage up to 1000 V
* are rated on the basis of either duty type S1 (continuous duty) or S3 (intermittent duty) with a rated cyclic duration factor of 80% or higher

The table below shows the IEC 60034-30 (2008) efficiency classes and comparable efficiency levels.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! Efficiency Levels
! Comparison
|-
| IE1
|Standard efficiency
|
|-
| IE2
| High efficiency
|For 50&amp;nbsp;Hz considerably higher than EFF2 of CEMEP and identical to the U.S. EPAct for 60&amp;nbsp;Hz
|-
| IE3
| Premium efficiency
| New efficiency class in Europe for 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, higher than EFF1 on CEMEP and with some exceptions identical to NEMA Premium in the United States for 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.
|}

The standard also reserves an IE4 class (Super Premium Efficiency) for the future. The following motors are excluded from the new efficiency standard:
* Motors made solely for inverter operation
* Motors completely integrated into a machine (pump, fan, or compressor) that cannot be tested separately from the machine.

[[File:Efficiencychart1 motorefficiency.png]]
''Graph is showing as example 50 Hz, 4-pole motors''

For 60&amp;nbsp;Hz operation, the IE2 and IE3 minimum full-load efficiency values are virtually identical to the North American National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nema.org/ |title=National Electrical Manufacturers Association |publisher=NEMA |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy Efficient and Premium Efficiency motor standards, respectively. (NEMA does specify different full-load efficiency values for motors with Totally Enclosed Fan-Cooled and Open Drip-proof enclosures and from 200HP IEC IE3 efficiency is slightly higher than NEMA Premium Efficiency). The IEC minimum full-load efficiency standards are higher for 60&amp;nbsp;Hz motors than for 50&amp;nbsp;Hz motors. This is because as long as the motor torque is constant, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R or winding resistance losses are the same at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. The motor output power, however, increases linearly with speed, increasing by 20% when the frequency is increased from 50&amp;nbsp;Hz to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. In general, the 60&amp;nbsp;Hz efficiency is about 2.5% to 0.5% greater than the 50&amp;nbsp;Hz values. The efficiency gain is greater for smaller motor power ratings.

To show compliance with these new efficiency standards, motors must be tested in accordance with the newly adopted [[IEC 60034-2–1]] testing protocol. This procedure provides test results that are largely compatible with those obtained by the North American [[IEEE 112B]] and [[CSA 390]] test methods. The new standard also requires that the motor efficiency class and nominal motor efficiency be labeled on the motor nameplate and given in [[product literature]] and motor catalogues in the following format:

'''IE3 94.5%'''

==New minimum energy performance standards in EU==
On 22 July 2009, Commission Regulation (EC) No 640/2009 implementing Directive 2005/32/EC states that in the EU, with the exception of some special applications, motors shall not be less efficient than the IE3 efficiency level as from 1 January 2015.

In detail:
* IE2 by June 16, 2011
* IE3 by January 1, 2015 (for motors &gt;=7.5 to 375&amp;nbsp;kW) and IE2 only in combination with an [[Adjustable Speed Drive|adjustable speed drive]]
* IE3 for all motors by January 1, 2017, (for motors from 0.75 to 375&amp;nbsp;kW) and IE2 only in combination with an adjustable speed drive.

EC 60034-30, IE3 Premium Efficiency (%) is presented in the table.

==Design of premium efficiency motors==
Design of Premium Efficiency Motors needs special knowledge, experience and test facilities, equipped with precision instrumentation. The task of design is, to get the efficiency up by minimizing and balancing the single losses, especially those created in the stator coils, the stator iron (magnetizing) and the losses within the rotor by slip. In comparison to standard (e.g. IE1) electrical motors, more iron and copper material are used. IE3 motors are heavier and physically bigger than IE1 motors.

Typically use of higher slot fill in the copper winding, use of thinner laminations of improved steel properties, reducing the air gap, better design of cooling fan, use of special and improved bearings etc. can ensure higher efficiency in the motors.

The high [[Copper wire and cable#Electrical conductivity|electrical conductivity]] of [[copper]] versus other metallic conductors enhances the electrical energy efficiency of motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=IE3 energy-saving motors |journal=Engineer Live |date=2013-02-21 |url=http://www.engineerlive.com/Design-Engineer/Motors_and_Drives/IE3_energy-saving_motors/22687/ |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the mass and cross section of conductors in a [[Inductor|coil]] increases the electrical energy efficiency of the motor.

==Commercial rebate programs==
The [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] Energy and Natural Resources Committee adopted a NEMA-advocated provision that created a premium energy-efficient motor rebate program, also known as a “crush for credit” program, according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). The program provided a $25 per horsepower rebate and a $5 per horsepower rebate for the disposal of the old motor. The latter program was needed to offset the cost difference between new, more expensive, efficient motors and the lesser cost to repair the older, more inefficient motors, NEMA says. This program allowed the federal government to spend $350 million in incentives for the widespread adoption of NEMA Premium motors.

Within the EU, various Capital Allowance Schemes encourage companies to purchase equipment incorporating premium-efficiency motors. For example, in the UK, the Enhanced Capital Allowances Scheme &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eca.gov.uk/etl/default.htm |accessdate=October 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306151742/http://www.eca.gov.uk/etl/default.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a [[Tax holiday|tax incentive]] to businesses that invest in equipment that meets published energy-saving criteria. The Energy Technology List (ETL) details the criteria for each type of technology, and lists those products in each category that meet them. It is managed by [[the Carbon Trust]], on behalf of the Government, and has two parts:
* The Energy Technology Criteria List (ETCL), which is reviewed annually as part of to ensure that it reflects technological progress. It sets out the qualifying energy-saving criteria for each class of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eca.gov.uk/etl/about/Budget+2006+Remove.htm |accessdate=October 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712004653/http://www.eca.gov.uk/etl/about/Budget+2006+Remove.htm |archivedate=July 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Energy Technology Product List (ETPL), updated at the start of each month on this website, lists the products and technologies that are eligible for an ECA.

The ETPL also contains details of the maximum claim values &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eca.gov.uk/etl/claim/claimvalues.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001115146/http://www.eca.gov.uk/etl/claim/claimvalues.htm |date=October 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for qualifying products which comprise a component in a larger piece of plant and machinery, which does not itself qualify for ECAs.

'''Key Features of the ECA scheme are'''
* Open to all businesses that pay UK corporation or [[income tax]], regardless of size, sector or location.
* Provides 100% first-year capital allowances on investments in energy-saving equipment against taxable profits of the period of investment.
* All the products listed on the ETPL must meet the energy-saving criteria, published in the ETCL.
* Only spending on new and unused energy-saving equipment can qualify for ECAs.
* Capital allowances are available for spending “on the provision of” plant and machinery. This can include certain costs arising as a direct result of the installation of qualifying plant and machinery such as; transport of the equipment to the site, and some direct installation costs. One can refer to the Claiming an ECA &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eca.gov.uk/etl/claim/_default.htm |accessdate=October 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709110640/http://www.eca.gov.uk/etl/claim/_default.htm |archivedate=July 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; section for more information.

A similar scheme in Ireland, Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA) run by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sei.ie/ |title=SEAI - Welcome to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland |publisher=Sei.ie |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; lets a company cut its [[taxable income]] by 100% of the capital cost of eligible energy-efficient equipment in the first year of purchase. This compares to just 12.5% for ineligible plant and machinery.

With the existing Capital Allowances tax structure, when money is spent on “capital equipment” companies can deduct the cost of this equipment from their profits proportionally over a period of 8 years, i.e. the annual taxable profit is only reduced by 1/8 of the total equipment cost.

With new ACA, when money is spent on “Eligible energy efficient capital equipment”, the company can deduct the full cost of this equipment from their profits in the year of purchase, i.e. the taxable profit in year one is reduced by the full cost of the equipment.

[[File:Recycle001.svg|thumb|right|The Universal Recycling Symbol, here rendered with a black outline and green fill. Both filled and outline versions of the symbol are in use.]]
The universal '''recycling symbol''' ({{Unichar|2672|Universal recycling symbol}} or {{Unichar|267B|Black universal recycling symbol}} in [[Unicode]]) is internationally recognized.

==History==
Worldwide attention to environmental issues led to the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970. [[Container Corporation of America]], a large producer of recycled paperboard, sponsored a contest for art and design students at high schools and colleges across the country to raise awareness of environmental issues. It was won by [[Gary Anderson (designer)|Gary Anderson]], then a 23-year-old college student at the [[University of Southern California]], whose entry was the image now known as the universal recycling symbol.&lt;ref name=GaryFound&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Penny|author2=Jerry Powell |title=Gary Anderson has been found!|journal=Resource Recycling: North America's Recycling and Composting Journal|date=May 1999|pages=pg.1–2|url=http://logoblink.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/recycling_symbol_garyanderson.pdf|accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol is not [[trademark]]ed and is in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name=GaryFound/&gt; The public-domain status of the symbol has been challenged, but this challenge was unsuccessful owing to the wide use of the symbol. However, the universal symbol may have been inspired by similar existing recycling symbols, such as one featuring two arrows chasing each other in a circle that Volkswagen stamped in the early 1960s into some automobile parts it remanufactured{{citation_needed|date=September 2018}}.

==Variants==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Gary anderson and recycling logo.JPG|right|thumbnail|[[Gary Anderson (recycling)|Gary Anderson]] (right) showing his original design of the recycling logo in 1970]] --&gt;
The recycling symbol is in the [[public domain]], and is not a [[trademark]]. The Container Corporation of America originally applied for a trademark on the design, but the application was challenged, and the corporation decided to abandon the claim.&lt;ref name="GaryFound"/&gt; As such, anyone may use or modify the recycling symbol, royalty-free.

Though use of the symbol is regulated by law in some countries,&lt;ref name=RulesLogo&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules Governing Use of Recycling Logo|url=http://www.recyclingexpert.co.uk/rules-governing-use-recycling-logo.html|work=Recycling Expert [website]|publisher=recyclingexpert.co.uk|accessdate=2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  countless variants of it exist worldwide. Anderson's original proposal had the arrows form a triangle standing on its tip—upside down compared with the versions most commonly seen today—but the CCA, in adopting Anderson's design, rotated it 60° to stand on its base instead.&lt;ref name="GaryFound"/&gt;

Both Anderson's proposal and CCA's designs form a Möbius strip with ''one'' half-twist by having two of the arrows fold over each other, and one fold under, thereby canceling out one of the other folds. However, most variants of the symbol used today have all the arrows folding over themselves, producing a Möbius strip with ''three'' half-twists. Existing single half-twist variants of the logo do not generally agree on which of the arrows is the one to fold underneath.  The logo is usually displayed with the arrows circulating clockwise, but the underlying Möbius strip exists in two [[topology|topologically]] distinct mirror-image forms of opposite [[handedness]].

The [[American Paper Institute]] originally promoted four different variants of the recycling symbol for different purposes. The plain Möbius loop, either white with an outline or solid black, was to be used to indicate that a product was ''recyclable''.  The other two variants had the Möbius loop inside a circle—either [[white on black]] or black on white—and were meant for products ''made of recycled materials'', with the white-on-black version to be used for 100% recycled fiber, and the black-on-white version for products containing both recycled and unrecycled fiber.&lt;ref name="GaryFound"/&gt; For example, a paper envelope might have both the first and last of these four symbols, to indicate that it was recyclable, and made from both recycled and unrecycled fibers.

In addition to the [[resin identification code]]s 1–7 in the triangular recycling symbol, Unicode lists the following recycling symbols:
* {{unichar|2672|UNIVERSAL RECYCLING SYMBOL}}
* {{unichar|267A|RECYCLING SYMBOL FOR GENERIC MATERIALS}}
* {{unichar|267B|BLACK UNIVERSAL RECYCLING SYMBOL}}
* {{unichar|267C|RECYCLED PAPER SYMBOL}} (indicates product contains recycled paper)
* {{unichar|267D|PARTIALLY-RECYCLED PAPER SYMBOL}} (indicates product contains partially recycled paper)
* {{unichar|267E|PERMANENT PAPER SIGN}} (e.g. for [[acid-free paper]])

An ISO/IEC working group has researched and documented some of the variations of the recycling logo currently{{when|date=June 2012}} in use, and has made recommendations for adding some more of them to the Unicode standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Everson|first1=Michael (co-editor)|title=Background information on Recycling Symbols|url=http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2342.pdf|work=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 N2342|publisher=ISO/IEC|accessdate=2011-05-26|first2=Asmus|last2=Freytag (co-editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rapid expansion of materials converted to [[printer filament]] for [[3-D printing]] using [[recyclebot]] technology, a large expansion of resin identification codes has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Emily J. Hunt, Chenlong Zhang, Nick Anzalone, Joshua M. Pearce, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.02.004 Polymer recycling codes for distributed manufacturing with 3-D printers], ''Resources, Conservation and Recycling'', '''97''', pp. 24-30 (2015). [https://www.academia.edu/11229348/Polymer_recycling_codes_for_distributed_manufacturing_with_3-D_printers open access]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resin identification code==
In 1988, the American [[Society of the Plastics Industry]] (SPI) developed the [[resin identification code]] which is used to indicate the predominant plastic material used in the manufacture of the product or packaging.  Their purpose is to assist recyclers with sorting the collected materials, but they do not necessarily mean that the product/packaging can be recycled either through domestic curbside collection or industrial collections.  The SPI symbols are loosely based on the Möbius loop symbol, but feature simpler bent (rather than folded over) arrows that can be embossed on plastic surfaces without loss of detail.  The arrows are formed into a flat, two-dimensional triangle rather than the pseudo-three-dimensional triangle used in the original recycling logo.

The different resin identification codes can be represented by [[Unicode]] icons &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♳&lt;/span&gt; (U+2673), &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♴&lt;/span&gt; (U+2674), &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♵&lt;/span&gt; (U+2675), &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♶&lt;/span&gt; (U+2676), &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♷&lt;/span&gt; (U+2677), &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♸&lt;/span&gt; (U+2678), &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♹&lt;/span&gt; (U+2679), and &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♺&lt;/span&gt; (U+267A).

[[Recycling codes]] extend these numbers above 7 to include various non-plastic materials, including metals, glass, paper, and batteries of various types. 

==Other variants==
[[File:Recycle symbol Taiwan.svg|thumb|[[Taiwan]]'s recycling symbol features the use of [[negative space]] to also create arrows pointing outward]]
♾, an [[infinity]] sign (∞) inside a circle, represents the '''permanent paper symbol''',  used in packaging and publishing to signify the use of durable [[acid-free paper]].   In some ways, this logo expresses the ''opposite'' intention from the recycle logo, in that the acid-free paper is intended to last indefinitely, rather than being recycled.  Nevertheless, acid-free paper does not usually contain toxic materials (although certain inks do), so it is easily recycled or composted.

A satirical version of the classic recycling logo also exists, in which the three arrows are twisted from a circular pattern to pointing radially outward, thus symbolizing wasteful one-time usage rather than environmentally friendly recycling.  This message is reinforced by the circular inscription, "THIS PROJECT WAS ENVIRONMENTALLY UNFRIENDLY", surrounding the modified logo.  The satirical logo appears in the 1998 catalog of an [[installation art]] work in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], in which the artist [[Steven Pippin]] modified a row of glass-doored washing machines in a [[laundromat]] to operate as giant cameras.  The cameras were used to take sequential photographs in the manner of pioneering [[stop motion]] photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]].  The front-loading washing machines were then used to develop and process the 24&amp;nbsp;inch (61&amp;nbsp;cm) diameter circular film negatives.&lt;ref name=LaundroLoco&gt;{{cite book|last=Pippin|first=Steven John|author2=San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|title=Laundromat locomotion : Mr. Pippin : [on the occasion of the Exhibition Laundromat Locomotion]|year=1998|publisher=Verlag der Kunst|location=[Amsterdam ; Dresden]|isbn=90-5705-094-3|type=Softcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[carpentry]], a '''reveal''' is a feature resembling a [[rabbet]], but constructed of separate pieces of [[wood]]. A reveal may typically be seen at the edge of a [[door]] or [[window]], where the face [[Molding (decorative)|molding]] is set back, often by a distance from 3/16" (5 mm) to 1/2" (12 mm,) to ''reveal'' the edge of the casing [[wood plank|plank]].

A "tight reveal" is where the distance to the edge of the casing is kept as small as possible, to give a smoother, more consistent look, often thought to be more contemporary. This is often achieved on a cabinet door by notching out the area of the door where the hinge mounts.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21861">In [[theoretical physics]], a '''scalar–tensor theory''' is a theory that includes both a [[Scalar field theory|scalar field]] and a [[tensor]] field to represent a certain interaction.  For example, the [[Brans–Dicke theory]] of [[gravitation]] uses both a scalar field and a [[tensor field]] to mediate the gravitational interaction.

== Tensor fields and field theory ==
Modern physics tries to derive all physical theories from as few principles as possible. In this way, [[Newtonian mechanics]] as well as [[quantum mechanics]] are derived from [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s ''[[principle of least action]]''. In this approach, the behavior of a system is not described via [[force]]s, but by functions which describe the energy of the system. Most important are the energetic quantities known as the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] function and the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] function. Their derivatives in space are known as [[Hamiltonian field theory|Hamiltonian density]] and [[Lagrangian (field theory)|the Lagrangian density]]. Going to these quantities leads to the field theories.

Modern physics uses [[field (physics)|field]] theories to explain reality. These fields can be [[scalar (physics)|scalar]], [[vector field|vectorial]] or [[tensor field|tensorial]]. An example of a scalar field is the temperature field. An example of a vector field is the wind velocity field. An example of a tensor field is the [[Cauchy stress tensor|stress tensor]] field in a stressed body, used in [[continuum mechanics]].

== Gravity as field theory ==
In physics, forces (as vectorial quantities) are given as the derivative (gradient) of scalar quantities named potentials. In classical physics before [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], gravitation was given in the same way, as consequence of a gravitational force (vectorial), given through a scalar potential field, dependent of the mass of the particles. Thus, [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] gravity is called a [[scalar theory]]. The gravitational force is dependent of the distance ''r'' of the massive objects to each other (more exactly, their centre of mass). Mass is a parameter and space and time are unchangeable.

Einstein's theory of gravity, the [[General Relativity]] (GR) is of another nature. It unifies space and time in a 4-dimensional ''manifold'' called space-time. In GR there is no gravitational force, instead, the actions we ascribed to being a force are the consequence of the local curvature of space-time. That curvature is defined mathematically by the so-called [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]], which is a function of the total energy, including mass, in the area. The derivative of the metric is a function that approximates the classical Newtonian force in most cases. The metric is a tensorial quantity of degree 2 (it can be given as a 4x4 matrix, an object carrying 2 indices).

Another possibility to explain gravitation in this context is by using both tensor (of degree n&gt;1) and scalar fields, i.e. so that gravitation is given neither solely through a scalar field nor solely through a metric. These are scalar–tensor theories of gravitation.

The field theoretical start of General Relativity is given through the Lagrange density. It is a scalar and gauge invariant (look at [[gauge theories]]) quantity dependent on the curvature scalar R. This Lagrangian, following Hamilton's principle, leads to the field equations of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]. If in the Lagrangian the curvature (or a quantity related to it) is multiplied with a square scalar field, field theories of scalar–tensor theories of gravitation are obtained. In them, the [[gravitational constant]] of Newton is no longer a real constant but a quantity dependent of the scalar field.

===Mathematical formulation===

An action of such a gravitational scalar–tensor theory can be written as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; S = \frac{1}{c} \int {d^4 x \sqrt{-g} \frac{1}{2 \mu}} \times \left[ \Phi  R-\frac{\omega(\Phi)}{\Phi} (\partial_\sigma \Phi)^2-V(\Phi)+ 2 \mu~\mathcal{L}_m (g_{\mu \nu}, \Psi)  \right], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the metric determinant, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci scalar constructed from the metric &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a coupling constant with the dimensions &lt;math&gt;L^{-1} M^{-1}T^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt; is the scalar-field potential, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_m&lt;/math&gt; is the material Lagrangian and &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; represents the non-gravitational fields. Here, the Brans–Dicke parameter &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; has been generalized to a function. Although &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is often written as being &lt;math&gt;8 \pi G / c^4&lt;/math&gt;, one has to keep in mind that the fundamental constant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; there, is not the [[Gravitational constant|constant of gravitation]] that can be measured with, for instance, [[Cavendish experiment|Cavendish type experiments]]. Indeed, the [[Gravitational constant|empirical gravitational constant]] is generally no longer a constant in scalar–tensor theories, but a function of the scalar field &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. The metric and scalar-field equations respectively write:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu \nu}R= \frac{\mu}{\Phi}T_{\mu
\nu}+ \frac{1}{\Phi} [\nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu -g_{\mu \nu}\Box]\Phi 
+\frac{\omega(\Phi)}{\Phi^2}(\partial_\mu \Phi \partial_\nu \Phi
- \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu \nu}(\partial_\alpha \Phi)^2)-g_{\mu \nu} \frac{V(\Phi)}{2 \Phi} , &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\omega(\Phi)+3}{\Phi}\Box \Phi=  \frac{\mu}{\Phi} T   - \frac{\omega'(\Phi)}{\Phi} (\partial_\sigma \Phi)^2 + V'(\Phi) - 2 \frac{V(\Phi)}{\Phi} . &lt;/math&gt;
Also, the theory satisfies the following conservation equation, implying that test-particles follow space-time [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesics]] such as in general relativity:
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_\sigma T^{\mu \sigma} = 0, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; T^{\mu \sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stress–energy tensor|stress-energy tensor]] defined as
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu \nu}=-\frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}} \frac{\delta(\sqrt{-g}\mathcal{L}_m)}{\delta g^{\mu \nu}}. &lt;/math&gt;

====The Newtonian approximation of the theory====

Developing perturbatively the theory defined by the previous action around a Minkowskian background, and assuming non-relativistic gravitational sources, the first order gives the Newtonian approximation of the theory. In this approximation, and for a theory without potential,  the metric writes
:&lt;math&gt;g_{00}=-1+ 2 \frac{U}{c^2}+\mathcal{O}(c^{-3}),~ g_{0i}=\mathcal{O}(c^{-2}),~ g_{ij}=\delta_{ij}+\mathcal{O}(c^{-1}),&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following usual [[Poisson's equation|Poisson equation]] at the lowest order of the approximation:

It corresponds to the remaining [[General covariance|diffeomorphism]] degree of freedom that is not fixed by the weak isotropy condition. The sources are defined as

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the (true) constant that appears in the coupling constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; defined previously.

== Observational constraints on the theory ==

Current observations indicate that &lt;math&gt;\gamma-1=(2.1 \pm 2.3)\times 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which means that &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 &gt; 40 000&lt;/math&gt;. Although explaining such a value in the context of the original [[Brans–Dicke theory]] is impossible, [[Thibault Damour|Damour]] and [[Kenneth Nordtvedt|Nordtvedt]] found that the field equations of the general theory often lead to an evolution of the function &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; toward infinity during the evolution of the universe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hence, according to them, the current high value of the function &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; could be a simple consequence of the evolution of the universe.

The best current constraint on the post-Newtonian parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; comes from Mercury's perihelion shift and is &lt;math&gt;|\beta-1|&lt;3 \times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Both constraints show that while the theory is still a potential candidate to replace general relativity, the scalar field must be very weakly coupled in order to explain current observations.

Generalized scalar-tensor theories have also been proposed as explanation for the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|accelerated expansion of the universe]] but the measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event [[GW170817]] has ruled this out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |title=Challenges to Self-Acceleration in Modified Gravity from Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure |first1=Lucas|last1=Lombriser |first2=Nelson|last2=Lima |arxiv=1602.07670 |class=astro-ph.CO |date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-02-quest-riddle-einstein-theory.html|title=Quest to settle riddle over Einstein's theory may soon be over|date=February 10, 2017|access-date=October 29, 2017|website=[[phys.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/science/2017/02/theoretical-battle-dark-energy-vs-modified-gravity/|title=Theoretical battle: Dark energy vs. modified gravity|date=February 25, 2017|access-date=October 27, 2017|website=[[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ezquiaga|first=Jose María|last2=Zumalacárregui|first2=Miguel|date=2017-12-18|title=Dark Energy After GW170817: Dead Ends and the Road Ahead|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.251304|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=119|issue=25|pages=251304|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.251304|bibcode=2017PhRvL.119y1304E|arxiv=1710.05901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Creminelli|first=Paolo|last2=Vernizzi|first2=Filippo|date=2017-12-18|title=Dark Energy after GW170817 and GRB170817A|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.251302|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=119|issue=25|pages=251302|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.251302|arxiv=1710.05877|bibcode=2017PhRvL.119y1302C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Higher-dimensional relativity and scalar–tensor theories ==

After the postulation of the [[General Relativity]] of Einstein and Hilbert, [[Theodor Kaluza]] and [[Oskar Klein]] proposed in 1917 a generalization in a 5-dimensional manifold: [[Kaluza–Klein theory]]. This theory possesses a 5-dimensional metric (with a ''compactified and constant 5th metric component, dependent on the ''gauge potential'') and unifies [[gravitation]] and [[electromagnetism]], i.e. there is a geometrization of electrodynamics.

This theory was modified in 1955 by [[P. Jordan]] in his ''Projective Relativity'' theory, in which, following group-theoretical reasonings, Jordan took a functional 5th metric component that lead to a variable gravitational constant ''G''. In his original work, he introduced coupling parameters of the scalar field, to change energy conservation as well, according to the ideas of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]].

Following the ''Conform Equivalence theory'', multidimensional theories of gravity are ''conform equivalent'' to theories of usual General Relativity in 4 dimensions with an additional scalar field. One case of this is given by Jordan's theory, which, without breaking energy conservation (as it should be valid, following from microwave background radiation being of a black body), is equivalent to the theory of [[Carl H. Brans|C. Brans]] and [[Robert H. Dicke]] of 1961, so that it is usually spoken about the ''Brans–Dicke theory''. The [[Brans–Dicke theory]] follows the idea of modifying Hilbert-Einstein theory to be compatible with [[Mach's principle]]. For this, Newton's gravitational constant had to be variable, dependent of the mass distribution in the universe, as a function of a scalar variable, coupled as a field in the Lagrangian. It uses a scalar field of infinite length scale (i.e. long-ranged), so, in the language of [[Hideki Yukawa|Yukawa]]'s theory of nuclear physics, this scalar field is a ''massless field''. This theory becomes Einsteinian for high values for the parameter of the scalar field.

In 1979, R. Wagoner proposed a generalization of scalar–tensor theories using more than one scalar field coupled to the scalar curvature.

JBD theories although not changing the geodesic equation for test particles, change the motion of composite bodies to a more complex one. The coupling of a universal scalar field directly to the gravitational field gives rise to potentially observable effects for the motion of matter configurations to which gravitational energy contributes significantly. This is known as the "Dicke–Nordtvedt" effect, which leads to possible violations of the Strong as well as the Weak Equivalence Principle for extended masses.

JBD-type theories with short-ranged scalar fields use, according to Yukawa's theory, ''massive scalar fields''. The first of this theories was proposed by A. Zee in 1979. He proposed a Broken-Symmetric Theory of Gravitation, combining the idea of Brans and Dicke with the one of Symmetry Breakdown, which is essential within the [[Standard Model]] SM of [[elementary particles]], where the so-called Symmetry Breakdown leads to mass generation (as a consequence of particles interacting with the Higgs field). Zee proposed the Higgs field of SM as scalar field and so the Higgs field to generate the gravitational constant.

The interaction of the Higgs field with the particles that achieve mass through it is short-ranged (i.e. of Yukawa-type) and gravitational-like (one can get a Poisson equation from it), even within SM, so that Zee's idea was taken 1992 for a scalar–tensor theory with Higgs field as scalar field with Higgs mechanism. There, the massive scalar field couples to the masses, which are at the same time the source of the scalar Higgs field, which generates the mass of the elementary particles through Symmetry Breakdown. For vanishing scalar field, this theories usually go through to standard General Relativity and because of the nature of the massive field, it is possible for such theories that the parameter of the scalar field (the coupling constant) does not have to be as high as in standard JBD theories. Though, it is not clear yet which of these models explains better the phenomenology found in nature nor if such scalar fields are really given or necessary in nature. Nevertheless, JBD theories are used to explain [[cosmic inflation|inflation]] (for massless scalar fields then it is spoken of the inflaton field) after the [[Big Bang]] as well as the [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]. Further, they are an option to explain dynamics usually given through the standard [[cold dark matter]] models, as well as [[MOND]], [[Axion]]s (from Breaking of a Symmetry, too), [[MACHOS]],...

== Connection to string theory ==

A generic prediction of all string theory models is that the spin-2 graviton has a spin-0 partner called the [[dilaton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Damour|first=Thibault|author-link=Thibault Damour|last2=Piazza|first2=Federico|last3=Veneziano|first3=Gabriele|author-link3=Gabriele Veneziano|date=2002-08-05|title=Runaway Dilaton and Equivalence Principle Violations|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.081601|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=89|issue=8|pages=081601|arxiv=gr-qc/0204094|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.081601|via=|bibcode=2002PhRvL..89h1601D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, string theory predicts that the actual theory of gravity is a scalar–tensor theory rather than general relativity. However, the precise form of such a theory is not currently known because one does not have the mathematical tools in order to address the corresponding non-perturbative calculations. Besides, the precise effective 4-dimensional form of the theory is also confronted to the so-called [[String theory landscape|landscape issue]].

A '''separator''' is a permeable [[artificial membrane|membrane]] placed between a [[battery (electricity)|battery's]] [[anode]] and [[cathode]]. The main function of a separator is to keep the two electrodes apart to prevent electrical [[short circuit]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s while also allowing the transport of ionic [[charge carriers]] that are needed to close the circuit during the passage of [[Current (electricity)|current]] in an [[electrochemical cell]].&lt;ref name=six&gt;Flaim, Tony, Yubao Wang, and Ramil Mercado. "High Refractive Index Polymer Coatings." SPIE Proceedings of Optical Systems Design. Web&lt;/ref&gt;

Separators are critical components in liquid [[electrolyte]] batteries. A separator generally consists of a [[polymeric membrane]] forming a microporous layer. It must be chemically and [[Electrochemistry|electrochemically]] stable with regard to the &lt;nowiki/&gt;[[electrolyte]] and electrode materials and mechanically strong enough to withstand the high [[Tension (physics)|tension]] during battery construction. They are important to batteries because their structure and properties considerably affect the battery performance, including the batteries energy and power densities, cycle life, and safety.&lt;ref name = Arora&gt;Arora, Pankaj and Zhang, Zhengming (John). “Battery Separators” Chemical Reviews 2004 104 (10), 4419-4462&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Unlike many forms of technology, polymer separators were not developed specifically for batteries. They were instead spin-offs of existing technologies, which is why most are not optimized for the systems they are used in.  Even though this may seem unfavorable, most polymer separators can be mass-produced at a low cost, because they are based on existing forms of technologies.&lt;ref name = two&gt;Choi, Sung-Seen, Soo Lee, Young, Whan Joo, Chang Goo Lee, Seung, Kyoo Park, Jong and Han, Kyoo-Seung “Electrospun PVDF nanofiber web as polymer electrolyte or separator” Electrochimica Acta 50 (2004) 339–343&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshino and co-workers of the [http://Asahi%20Kasei%20Corporation Asahi Kasei Corporation] first developed them for a prototype of secondary lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in 1983.

[[File:Schematic of a Li-ion battery.jpg|thumb|Schematic of a lithium ion battery]]

Initially, [[lithium cobalt oxide]] was used as the cathode and [[polyacetylene]] as the anode. Later in 1985, it was found that using [[lithium cobalt oxide]] as the cathode and [[graphite]] as the anode produced an excellent secondary battery with enhanced stability, employing the frontier electron theory of Kenichi Fukui&lt;ref name=jone&gt;(Licari, J. J., and B. L. Weigand. "Solvent-Removable Coatings for Electronic Applications." ACS Symposium Series 123 (1980): 127-37. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt;  This enabled the development of portable devices, such as cell phones and laptops.  However, before [[lithium ion batteries]] could be mass-produced, safety concerns needed to be addressed such as overheating and over potential. One key to ensuring safety was the separator between the cathode and anode. Yoshino developed a microporous [[polyethylene]] membrane separator with a “fuse” function.&lt;ref name="thermal"&gt;Chung, Y. S., S. H. Yoo, and C. K. Kim. "Enhancement of Meltdown Temperature of the Polyethylene Lithium-Ion Battery." Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research 48.9 (2009): 4346-351. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;   In the case of abnormal heat generation within the battery cell, the separator provides a shutdown mechanism. The micropores close by melting and the ionic flow terminates.  In 2004, a novel electroactive polymer separator with the function of overcharge protection was first proposed by Denton, et al.&lt;ref name = four&gt;Feng, J.K., Ai, X.P, Cao, Y.L. et al “A polytriphenylamine-modified separator with reversible overcharge protection for 3.6 V-class lithium-ion battery” Journal of Power Sources 189 (2009) 771–774&lt;/ref&gt;  This kind of separator reversibly switches between insulating and conducting states. Changes in charge potential drive the switch. More recently, separators primarily provide charge transport and electrode separation.

== Materials ==
Materials include nonwoven fibers ([[cotton]], [[nylon]], [[polyesters]], [[glass]]), polymer films ([[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], poly ([[tetrafluoroethylene]]), [[polyvinyl chloride]]), [[ceramic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.targray.com/li-ion-battery/separators/ceramic-separators/|title=Ceramic Separators for Lithium-ion Battery Manufacturing &amp; Research|publisher=Targray|date=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and naturally occurring substances ([[rubber]], [[asbestos]], [[wood]]). Some separators employ polymeric materials with pores of less than 20 Å, generally too small for batteries. Both dry and wet processes are used for fabrication.&lt;ref name=thirthteen&gt;Munshi, M. Z. A. Handbook of Solid State Batteries &amp; Capacitors. Singapore: World Scientific Pub., 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twenty-four&gt;Zhang, S.S. “A review on the separators of liquid electrolyte Li-ion batteries” Journal of Power Sources 164 (2007) 351–364&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonwovens consist of a manufactured sheet, web or mat of directionally or randomly oriented fibers.

Supported liquid membranes consist of a solid and liquid phase contained within a microporous separator.

Some polymer electrolytes form complexes with [[alkali metal]] salts, which produce ionic conductors that serve as solid electrolytes.

Solid ion conductors, can serve as both separator and the electrolyte.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, L. C., M. K. Harvey, J. C. Ng, and U. Scheunemann. ''Ultra-high Molecular Weight Polyethylene UHMW-PE/ and Its.'' Science Direct, 18 May 1998. 13 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Separators can use a single or multiple layers/sheets of material.

== Production ==

Polymer separators generally are made from microporous polymer membranes. Such membranes are typically fabricated from a variety of inorganic, organic and naturally occurring materials. Pore sizes are typically larger than 50-100 Å. 

Membranes synthesized by dry processes are more suitable for higher power density, given their open and uniform pore structure, while those made by wet processes are offer more charge/discharge cycles because of their tortuous and interconnected pore structure. This helps to suppress the conversion of charge carriers into crystals on anodes during fast or low temperature charging.&lt;ref name=nine&gt;Jeon, M.Y., and C.K. Kim. "Phase Behavior of Polymer/diluent/diluent Mixtures and Their Application to Control Microporous Membrane Structure." Journal of Membrane Science 300 (2007): 172-81. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dry process ===

The dry process involves extruding, annealing and stretching steps. The final porosity depends on the morphology of the precursor film and the specifics of each step. The extruding step is generally carried out at a temperature higher than the [[Melting points|melting point]] of the [[polymer resin]]. This is because the resins are melted to shape them into a uniaxially-oriented tubular film, called a precursor film.  The structure and orientation of the precursor film depends on the processing conditions and the resin's characteristics. In the [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] process, the precursor is annealed at a temperature slightly lower than the polymer's melting point. The purpose of this step is to improve the crystalline structure. During stretching, the annealed film is deformed along the machine direction by a cold stretch followed by a hot stretch followed by relaxation. The cold stretch creates the pore structure by stretching the film at a lower temperature with a faster strain rate. The hot stretch increases pore sizes using a higher temperature and a slower strain rate. The relaxation step reduces internal stress within the film.&lt;ref name=onefive&gt;zawa, Kazunori. Lithium Ion Rechargeable Batteries: materials, Technology, and New Applications. Weinheim: WILEY-VCH, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twentythree&gt;Zhang, S.S., Ervin, M.H., Xu, K., Jow, T.R.“Microporous polyacrylonitrile-methyl methacrylate membrane as a separator of rechargeable lithium battery” Electrochimica Acta 49 2004 3339–3345&lt;/ref&gt;

The dry process is only suitable for polymers with high [[crystallinity]]. These include but are not limited to: semi-crystalline [[polyolefins]], [[polyoxymethylene]], and [[isotactic]] poly (4-methyl-1-pentene). One can also use blends of immiscible polymers, in which at least one polymer has a crystalline structure, such as polyethylene-[[polypropylene]], polystyrene-polypropylene, and poly ([[ethylene]] [[terephthalate]]) - polypropylene blends.&lt;ref name= eleven&gt;Lee, J.Y., Lee, Y.M. Bhattacharya, B. et al. “Separator grafted with siloxane by electron beam irradiation for lithium secondary batteries” Electrochimica Acta 54 2009 4312–4315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twentyfour&gt;Zhang, S.S. “A review on the separators of liquid electrolyte Li-ion batteries” Journal of Power Sources 164 2007 351–364&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wet process ===

The wet process consists of mixing, heating, extruding and additive removal steps. The polymer resins are first mixed with, [[Mineral oil|paraffin oil]], [[antioxidant]] and other additives. The mixture is heated to produce a homogenous solution. The heated solution is pushed through a sheet die to make a gel-like film. The additives are then removed with a volatile solvent to form the microporous result.&lt;ref name= seven&gt;Gwon, S.J., Choi, J.H. , Sohn, J.Y. and et al. “Preparation of a new micro-porous poly(methyl methacrylate)-grafted polyethylene separator for high performance Li secondary battery.” Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research B 267 (2009) 3309–3313&lt;/ref&gt;

The wet process is suitable for both crystalline and amorphous polymers. Wet process separators often use ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene.

=== Choice of polymer ===
[[File:Polypropylen.svg|thumb|The chemical structure of polypropylene]]
[[File:Polyethylene-repeat-2D.png|thumb|The chemical structure of polyethylene]]

Specific types of polymers are ideal for the different types of synthesis. Most polymers currently used in battery separators are [[polyolefin]] based materials with [[semi-crystalline]] structure. Among them, [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], and their blends such as polyethylene-polypropylene are widely used. Recently, graft polymers have been studied in an attempt to improve battery performance, including micro-porous poly([[methyl methacrylate]])-grafted&lt;ref name=jseven&gt;Gwon, S.J.,  Choi, J.H. , Sohn, J.Y.  and et al. “Preparation of a new micro-porous poly(methyl methacrylate)-grafted polyethylene separator for high performance Li secondary battery.” Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research B 267 2009 3309–3313&lt;/ref&gt; and [[siloxane]] grafted polyethylene separators, which show favorable surface morphology and electrochemical properties compared to conventional polyethylene separators. In addition, [[polyvinylidene fluoride]] (PVDF) nanofiber webs can be synthesized as a separator to improve both ion conductivity and dimensional stability&lt;ref name=jtwo&gt;Choi, Sung-Seen, Soo Lee, Young, Whan Joo, Chang Goo Lee, Seung,  Kyoo Park, Jong and Han, Kyoo-Seung “Electrospun PVDF nanofiber web as polymer electrolyte or separator” Electrochimica Acta 50 2004 339–343&lt;/ref&gt;  Another type of polymer separator, polytriphenylamine (PTPAn)-modified separator, is an electroactive separator with reversible overcharge protection.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Feng, J.K., Ai, X.P, Cao, Y.L. et al “A polytriphenylamine-modified separator with reversible overcharge protection for 3.6 V-class lithium-ion battery” Journal of Power Sources 189 2009 771–774&lt;/ref&gt;

== Placement ==
[[File:Side view of a Battery.jpg|thumb|Side view of a battery]]

Always the separator is placed between the anode and the cathode. The pores of the separator are filled with the electrolyte and packaged for use.&lt;ref name=fourteen&gt;Nikolou, Maria. Dyer, Aubrey. Steckler, Timothy. Donoghue, Evan. Wu, Zhuangchun. Heston, Nathan. Rinzler, Andrew. Tanner, David. Reynolds, John. Dual n- and p-Type Dopable Electrochromic Devices Employing Transparent Carbon Nanotube Electrodes Chemistry of Materials 2009 21 (22), 5539-5547&lt;/ref&gt;

== Essential properties ==

; Chemical stability: The separator material must be chemically stable against the electrolyte and electrode materials under the strongly reactive environments when the battery is fully charged. The separator should not degrade. Stability is assessed by use testing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Jeong, Yeon-Bok, and Dong-Won Kim. "Cycling Performances of Li/LiCoO2 Cell with Polymer-coated Separator." Electrochimica Acta 50.2-3 2004: 323-26. Science Direct. Web. 13 Oct. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Thickness: A battery separator must be thin to facilitate the battery's [[Energy density|energy]] and [[Power density|power densities]]. A separator that is too thin can compromise mechanical strength and safety. Thickness should be uniform to support many charging cycles. 25.4μm-(1.0 [[thousandth of an inch|mil]]) is generally the standard width. The thickness of a polymer separator can be measured using the T411 om-83 method developed under the auspices of the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry.&lt;ref name=sixteen&gt;Pitet, Louis M., Mark A. Amendt, and Marc A. Hillmyer. "Nanoporous Linear Polyethylene from a Block Polymer Precursor." Journal of the American Chemical Society 132.24 (2010): 8230-231. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Porosity: The separator must have sufficient pore density to hold liquid electrolyte that enables ions to move between the electrodes. Excessive porosity hinders the ability of the pores to close, which is vital to allow the separator to shut down an overheated battery. Porosity can be measured using liquid or gas absorption methods according to the American Society for Testing and Materials ([[ASTM International|ASTM]]) D-2873. Typically, a Li-ion battery separator provides porosity of 40%.&lt;ref name="nine"/&gt;
; Pore size: Pore size must be smaller than the particle size of the electrode components, including the active materials and conducting additives. Ideally the pores should be uniformly distributed while also having a tortuous structure. This ensures a uniform current distribution throughout the separator while suppressing the growth of Li on the anode. The distribution and structure of pores can be analyzed using a Capillary Flow Porometer or a [[Scanning Electron Microscope]].&lt;ref name = seventeen&gt;Ruxandra Vidu and Pieter Stroeve. Improvement of the Thermal Stability of Li-Ion Batteries by Polymer Coating of LiMn2O4 Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research 2004 43 (13), 3314-3324&lt;/ref&gt;
; Permeability: The separator must not limit performance. Polymer separators typically increase the resistance of the electrolyte by a factor of four to five. The ratio of the resistance of the electrolyte-filled separator to the resistance of the electrolyte alone is called the MacMullin number. [[Air permeability]] can be used indirectly to estimate the MacMullin number. Air permeability is expressed in terms of the [[Gurley value]], the time required for a specified amount of air to pass through a specified area of the separator under a specified pressure. The Gurley value reflects the tortuosity of the pores, when the porosity and thickness of the separator is fixed. A separator with uniform porosity is vital to battery life cycle. Deviations from uniform permeability produce uneven current density distribution, which causes the formation of crystals on the anode.&lt;ref name= ten&gt;(Kim, J.Y. and Lim, D.Y.. “Surface-Modified Membrane as A Separator for Lithium-Ion Polymer Battery.” Energies 2010, 3(4), 866-885)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= twenty-three)&gt;Yoo, S. H., and C. K. Kim. "Enhancement of the Meltdown Temperature of a Lithium Ion Battery Separator." Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research 48 (2009): 99335-941. Print&lt;/ref&gt;
; Mechanical strength: The separator must be strong enough to withstand the tension of the winding operation during battery assembly. Mechanical strength is typically defined in terms of the tensile strength in both the machine (winding) direction and the transverse direction, in terms of tear resistance and puncture strength. These parameters are defined in terms of [[Young’s modulus]].&lt;ref name = eighteen&gt;Scrosati, Bruno. Applications of Electroactive Polymers. London: Chapman &amp; Hall, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Wettability: The electrolyte must fill the entire battery assembly, requiring the separator to "wet" easily with the electrolyte. Furthermore, the electrolyte should be able to permanently wet the separator, preserving the cycle life. There is no generally accepted method used to test [[wettability]], other than observation.&lt;ref name = nineteen&gt;Stroeve, Pieter, and Anna C. Balaz. "Macromolecular Assemblies in Polymeric Systems." ACS Symposium Series 493 (1993): 1-7. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Thermal stability: The separator must remain stable over a wide temperature range without curling or puckering, laying completely flat.&lt;ref name = twenty&gt;Sohna, Joon-Yong, Sung-Jin Gwon, Jae-Hak Choi, Junhwa Shina, and Young-Chang Nho. "Preparation of Polymer-coated Separators Using an Electron Beam Irradiation." Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research B (2008): 4994-5000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Thermal shutdown: Separators in lithium-ion batteries must offer the ability to shut down at a temperature slightly lower than that at which [[thermal runaway]] occurs, while retaining its mechanical properties.&lt;ref name="thermal"/&gt;

==Defects==
Many Structural defects can form in polymer separators due to temperature changes. These structural defects can result in a thicker separators. Furthermore, there can be intrinsic defects in the polymers themselves, such as polyethylene often begins to deteriorate during the stages of polymerization, transportation, and storage.&lt;ref name=twentyfive&gt;E. O. Koval’, V. V. Kolyagin, I. G. Klimov and E. A. Maier. "Investigation of the influence of technological factors on quality of basic brands of HPPE" Russian Journal of Applied Chemistry
Volume 83, Number 6, 1115-1120&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, defects such as tears or holes can form during the synthesis of polymer separators. There are also other sources of defects can come from doping the polymer separator.&lt;ref name="Arora"/&gt; Recently groups have been trying to improve the wettability of the polymer separators by co-doping the normal polyethylene separator with acrylonitrile. The researchers found that acrylonitrile was more susceptible to be compatible with the electrolyte due to the wettability property.&lt;ref name=twentysix&gt;Jun Young Kim and Dae Young Lim. "Plasma-Modified Polyethylene Separator Membrane for Lithium-ion Polymer Battery" Next generation lithium ion batteries for electrical vehicles. 56-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Li-ion Batteries==
Polymer separators, similar to battery separators in general, act as a separator of the anode and cathode in the Li-ion battery while also enabling the movement of ions through the cell. Additionally, many of the polymer separators, typically multilayer polymer separators, can act as “shutdown separators”, which are able to shut down the battery if it becomes too hot during the cycling process.  These multilayered polymer separators are generally composed of one or more polyethylene layers which serve to shut down the battery and at least one polypropylene layer which acts as a form of mechanical support for the separator.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;&lt;ref name=five&gt;Feng, J.K. Ai, X.P., Cao Y.L. et al. “Polytriphenylamine used as an electroactive separator material for overcharge protection of rechargeable lithium battery” Journal of Power Sources 161 (2006) 545–549&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types of battery separators==
In addition to polymer separators, there are several other types of separators. There are nonwovens, which consist of a manufactured sheet, web, or mat of directionally or randomly oriented fibers. Supported liquid membranes, which consist of a solid and liquid phase contained within a microporous separator. Additionally there are also polymer electrolytes which can form complexes with different types of alkali metal salts, which results in the production of ionic conductors which serve as solid electrolytes. Another type of separator, a solid ion conductor, can serve as both a separator and the electrolyte in a battery.&lt;ref name = twenty-one&gt;Wang, L. C., M. K. Harvey, J. C. Ng, and U. Scheunemann. "Ultra-high Molecular Weight Polyethylene UHMW-PE/ and Its." Weblogin:. Science Direct, 18 May 1998. Web. 13 Oct. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] technology was used to modify a polyethylene membrane for enhanced adhesion, wettability and printability. These are usually performed by modifying the membrane on only its outermost several molecular levels. This allows the surface to behave differently without modifying the properties of the remainder. The surface was modified with acrylonitrile via a plasma coating technique.  The resulting acrylonitrile-coated membrane was named PiAn-PE. The surface characterization demonstrated that PiAN-PE's enhanced adhesion resulted from the increased polar component of surface energy.&lt;ref name=btwo&gt;Kim, J. Y. Plasma-modified polyethylene membranes as a separator for lithium-ion polymer battery. Electrochimica Acta, 2009, 54(14), 3714-3719&lt;/ref&gt;

The sealed rechargeable [[nickel-metal hydride battery]] offers significant performance and environmental friendliness above alkaline rechargeable batteries.  Ni/MH, like the lithium-ion battery, provides high energy and power density with long cycle lives.  This technology's greatest problem is its inherent high corrosion rate in aqueous solutions.  The most commonly used separators are porous insulator films of [[polyolefin]], nylon or cellophane. Acrylic compounds can be radiation-grafted onto these separators to make their properties more wettable and permeable. Zhijiang Cai and co-workers developed a solid polymer membrane gel separator. This was a polymerization product of one or more [[monomers]] selected from the group of [[water-soluble]] ethylenically unsaturated [[amides]] and acid.  The polymer-based gel also includes a water swellable polymer, which acts as a reinforcing element.  Ionic species are added to the solution and remain embedded in the gel after polymerization. 

Ni/MH batteries of bipolar design (bipolar batteries) are being developed because they offer some advantages for applications as storage systems for electric vehicles.  This solid polymer membrane gel separator could be useful for such applications in bipolar design.  In other words, this design can help to avoid short-circuits occurring in liquid-electrolyte systems.&lt;ref name=bthree&gt;Cai, Z. Possible application of novel solid polymer membrane gel separator in nickel/metal hydride battery. Journal of Materials Science, 2004, 39, 703-705&lt;/ref&gt;

Inorganic polymer separators have also been of interest as use in lithium-ion batteries.  Inorganic particulate film/[[poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)]]/inorganic particulate film trilayer separators are prepared by [[dip-coating]] inorganic particle layers on both sides of PMMA thin films.  This inorganic trilayer membrane is believed to be an inexpensive, novel separator for application in lithium-ion batteries from increased dimensional and thermal stability.&lt;ref name= thirty&gt;Kim, M; Han, G. Y.; Yoon, K. J.; Park, J. Y.  Preparation of a trilayer separator and its application to lithium-ion batteries.  Journal of Power Sources, 2010, 195(24), 8302-8305&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Crystallization}}
A '''single crystal''' or '''monocrystalline''' [[solid]] is a material in which the [[crystal lattice]] of the entire sample is continuous and unbroken to the edges of the sample, with no [[Grain boundary|grain boundaries]]. The absence of the defects associated with grain boundaries can give monocrystals unique properties, particularly mechanical, optical and electrical, which can also be [[anisotropic]], depending on the type of [[crystallography|crystallographic]] structure. These properties, in addition to making them precious in some gems, are industrially used in technological applications, especially in optics and electronics.

Because [[entropy|entropic]] effects favour the presence of some imperfections in the microstructure of solids, such as [[impurity|impurities]], inhomogeneous strain and crystallographic defects such as [[dislocation]]s, perfect single crystals of meaningful size are exceedingly rare in nature, and are also difficult to produce in the laboratory, though they can be made under controlled conditions. On the other hand, imperfect single crystals can reach enormous sizes in nature: several [[mineral]] species such as [[beryl]], [[gypsum]] and [[feldspar]]s are known to have produced crystals several metres across.

The opposite of a single crystal is an amorphous structure where the atomic position is limited to short range order only. In between the two extremes exist ''[[polycrystalline]]'', which is made up of a number of smaller crystals known as ''[[crystallite]]s'', and ''[[paracrystalline]]'' phases.

== Uses ==

=== Semiconductor industry ===

[[Monocrystalline silicon|Single crystal silicon]] is used in the [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|fabrication of semiconductors]].  On the [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] scale that [[microprocessor]]s operate on, the presence of grain boundaries would have a significant impact on the functionality of [[field effect transistor]]s by altering local electrical properties. Therefore, microprocessor fabricators have invested heavily in facilities to produce large single crystals of silicon.

=== Optics ===

* Monocrystals of [[fluorite]] are sometimes used in the objective lenses of [[apochromat]]ic [[refractor|refracting telescopes]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

=== Materials engineering ===

Another application of single crystal solids is in materials science in the production of high strength materials with low thermal [[creep (deformation)|creep]], such as [[turbine blades]].&lt;ref name=spt&gt;Spittle, Peter. [http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~kadem/Rolls%20Royce.pdf "Gas turbine technology"] ''[[Rolls-Royce plc]]'', 2003.

=== Electrical conductors ===
Single crystals provide a means to understand, and perhaps realize, the ultimate performance of metallic conductors.

Of all the metallic elements, silver and copper have the best conductivity at room temperature, so set the bar for performance.  The size of the market, and vagaries in supply and cost, have provided strong incentives to seek alternatives or find ways to use less of them by improving performance.

The conductivity of commercial conductors is often expressed relative to the [[International Annealed Copper Standard]], according to which the purest copper wire available in 1914 measured around 100%.  The purest modern copper wire is a better conductor, measuring over 103% on this scale.  The gains are from two sources.  First, modern copper is more pure.  However, this avenue for improvement seems at an end.  Making the copper purer still makes no significant improvement.  Second, [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] and other processes have been improved.  Annealing reduces the dislocations and other crystal defects which are sources of resistance.  But the resulting wires are still polycrystalline.  The grain boundaries and remaining crystal defects are responsible for some residual resistance.  This can be quantified and better understood by examining single crystals.

As anticipated, single-crystal copper did prove to have better conductivity than polycrystalline copper.&lt;ref name=Cho&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cho|first=Yong Chan |author2=Seunghun Lee |author3=Muhammad Ajmal |author4=Won-Kyung Kim |author5=Chae Ryong Cho |author6=Se-Young Jeong |author7=Jeung Hun Park |author8=Sang Eon Park |author9=Sungkyun Park |author10=Hyuk-Kyu Pak |author11=Hyoung Chan Kim |title=Copper Better than Silver: Electrical Resistivity of the Grain-Free Single-Crystal Copper Wire|journal=Crystal Growth &amp; Design|date= March 22, 2010|volume=10|pages=2780–2784|doi=10.1021/cg1003808|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cg1003808|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But there were surprises in store (see table).  The single-crystal copper not only became a better conductor than high purity polycrystalline silver, but with prescribed heat and pressure treatment could surpass even single-crystal silver.  And although impurities are usually bad for conductivity, a silver single-crystal with a small amount of copper substitutions was a better conductor than them all.
 
As of 2009, no single-crystal copper is manufactured on a large scale industrially, but methods of producing very large individual crystal sizes for copper conductors are exploited for high performance electrical applications. These can be considered meta-single crystals with only a few crystals per metre of length.

=== In research ===

Single crystals are essential in research especially [[condensed-matter physics]], [[materials science]], [[surface science]] etc. The detailed study of the [[crystal structure]] of a material by techniques such as [[Bragg diffraction]] and [[helium atom scattering]] is much easier with monocrystals. Only in single crystals it is possible to study directional dependence of various properties. Furthermore, techniques such as [[scanning tunneling microscopy]] are only possible on surfaces of single crystals. In [[superconductivity]] there have been cases of materials where superconductivity is only seen in single crystalline specimen. They may be grown for this purpose, even when the material is otherwise only needed in [[polycrystalline]] form.

== Manufacture ==

In the case of silicon and metal single crystal fabrication the techniques used involve highly controlled and therefore relatively slow [[Crystallisation|crystallization]].

Specific techniques to produce large single crystals (aka [[boule (crystal)|boules]]) include the [[Czochralski process]] and the [[Bridgman technique]]. Other less exotic methods of crystallization may be used, depending on the physical properties of the substance, including [[hydrothermal synthesis]], [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], or simply [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|solvent-based crystallization]].

A different technology to create single crystalline materials is called [[epitaxy]].  As of 2009, this process is used to deposit very thin (micrometre to nanometer scale) layers of the same or different materials on the surface of an existing single crystal. Applications of this technique lie in the areas of semiconductor production, with potential uses in other nanotechnological fields and catalysis.

'''Soil moisture sensors''' measure the volumetric [[water content]] in [[soil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James E. |last=Arnold |publisher=NASA |title=Soil Moisture |url=http://wwwghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/landprocess/lp_home.htm |accessdate=15 June 2015 |quote=Soil moisture is difficult to define because it means different things in different disciplines. For example, a farmer's concept of soil moisture is different from that of a water resource manager or a weather forecaster. Generally, however, soil moisture is the water that is held in the spaces between soil particles. Surface soil moisture is the water that is in the upper 10 cm of soil, whereas root zone soil moisture is the water that is available to plants, which is generally considered to be in the upper 200 cm of soil. }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the direct [[Gravimetric analysis|gravimetric measurement]] of free soil moisture requires removing, drying, and weighting of a sample, soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content indirectly by using some other property of the soil, such as electrical resistance, dielectric constant, or interaction with [[neutron]]s, as a proxy for the moisture content. The relation between the measured property and soil moisture must be calibrated and may vary depending on environmental factors such as soil type, [[temperature]], or [[electric conductivity]]. Reflected [[microwave]] radiation is affected by the soil moisture and is used for [[remote sensing]] in [[hydrology]] and agriculture. Portable probe instruments can be used by farmers or gardeners.

Soil moisture sensors typically refer to sensors that estimate volumetric water content. Another class of sensors measure another property of moisture in soils called [[water potential]]; these sensors are usually referred to as soil water potential sensors and include [[Tensiometer (soil science)|tensiometer]]s and gypsum blocks.

==Technology==
Technologies commonly used to indirectly measure volumetric water content (soil moisture) include)

* [[Frequency domain sensor|Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR)]]: The [[dielectric constant]] of a certain volume element around the sensor is obtained by measuring the operating frequency of an oscillating circuit.
* [[Time domain reflectometry|Time Domain Transmission (TDT) and Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR)]]: The [[dielectric constant]] of a certain volume element around the sensor is obtained by measuring the speed of propagation along a buried transmission line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.usu.edu/soilphysics/SCOTT/2005_JHYDROL_Blonquist-etal_TDR.pdf |title=A time domain transmission sensor with TDR performance characteristics |last=Blonquist |first=J.

* [[Neutron moisture gauge]]s: The [[Neutron moderator|moderator]] properties of water for neutrons are utilized to estimate soil moisture content between a source and detector probe. 
* [[Soil resistivity]]:  Measuring how strongly the soil resists the flow of electricity between two electrodes can be used to determine the soil moisture content.
*[[Galvanic cell]]: The amount of water present can be determined based on the voltage the soil produces because water acts as an electrolyte and produces electricity. The technology behind this concept is the galvanic cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/acs.analchem.5b01653 | volume=87 | title=Galvanic Cell Type Sensor for Soil Moisture Analysis | journal=Analytical Chemistry | pages=7439–7445 | last1 = Gaikwad | first1 = Pramod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

===Agriculture===
Measuring soil moisture is important for [[agriculture|agricultural]] applications to help farmers manage their [[irrigation system]]s more efficiently. Knowing the exact soil moisture conditions on their fields, not only are farmers able to generally use less water to grow a crop, they are also able to increase yields and the quality of the crop by improved management of soil moisture during critical plant growth stages.{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence, especially how "quality" of a crop can be improved|date=July 2015}}

===Landscape irrigation===
In [[urban area|urban]] and [[suburban]] areas, [[Garden|landscapes]] and residential [[lawn]]s are using soil moisture sensors to interface with an irrigation controller. Connecting a soil moisture sensor to a simple irrigation clock will convert it into a "smart" irrigation controller that prevents irrigation cycles when the soil is already wet, e.g. following a recent rainfall event.

Golf courses are using soil moisture sensors to increase the efficiency of their irrigation systems to prevent over-watering and leaching of fertilizers and other chemicals into the ground.{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source/examples needed for application on golf courses|date=July 2015}}

===Research===
Soil moisture sensors are used in numerous research applications, e.g. in [[agricultural science]] and [[horticulture]] including irrigation planning, [[Climatology|climate research]], or [[environmental science]] including [[Solution|solute]] transport studies and as auxiliary sensors for [[soil respiration]] measurements.&lt;ref&gt;Decagon Devices "[http://manuals.decagon.com/Bibliographies/soils.pdf List of peer-reviewed publications using Decagon soil moisture sensors]". Retrieved: 20 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple Sensors for Gardeners===
Relatively cheap and simple devices that do not require a power source are available for checking whether plants have sufficient moisture to thrive. After inserting a probe into the soil for approximately 60 seconds, a meter indicates if the soil is too dry, moist or wet for plants.{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source/examples needed|date=July 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1590">In [[forestry]], '''stocking''' is a [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] measure of the area occupied by [[tree]]s, usually measured in terms of well-spaced trees or [[basal area]] per [[hectare]], relative to an optimum or desired level of density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Glossary of Forestry Terms in British Columbia | publisher = Ministry of Forests and Range (Canada) | date = March 2008 | url = http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/library/documents/glossary/Glossary.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A desirable level of stocking is often considered that which maximizes [[timber|timber production]], or other [[forest management|management objectives]].

Stocking can be expressed in either absolute or relative terms. Absolute terms include the basal area or trees per acre. Relative terms measure the density against a reference level, which is determined by dominant tree species, the [[Phytochorion|plant community]], and [[site index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor-last =United States Forest Service | contribution =Chapter 9 - Timber Stocking Guides and Growth Predictions | contribution-url =http://gis.fs.fed.us/im/directives/fsh/2409.17/9-9.2.txt | title =FSH 2409.17 Silvicultural Practices Handbook | publisher =United States Department of Agriculture | url =http://gis.fs.fed.us/cgi-bin/Directives/get_dirs/fsh?2409.17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stand density''' is not the same as stocking. See [[stand density index]] for the difference.

"'''The Doomsday Machine'''" is the sixth episode of the [[Star Trek: The Original Series (season 2)|second season]] of the American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. Written by [[Norman Spinrad]] and directed by [[Marc Daniels]], it was first broadcast on October 20, 1967.

In the episode, the [[starship]] ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' fights a powerful planet-killing machine from another galaxy. 

==Plot==
The [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] starship USS ''Enterprise'', following a trail of mysteriously destroyed star systems, picks up the automated distress beacon of another starship, the USS ''Constellation''. Upon arrival, the ''Constellation'' is found drifting in space and severely damaged; Captain [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]], Chief Medical Officer [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]], Chief Engineer [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Scott]] and a damage control team transport to the ship to evaluate her. There they discover the only member of the crew still aboard, [[Star Trek uniforms|Commodore]] [[List of Star Trek characters (A–F)#Matt Decker|Matt Decker]], her captain, who is suffering from severe mental trauma.

Decker explains that he and his crew had discovered a giant machine, miles long, that used beams of [[antiproton]]s to tear planets apart, consuming the rubble for fuel. Their attack on the machine was ineffective and they suffered heavy damage. Decker evacuated his crew to one of the planets of the system, which the machine subsequently destroyed. Kirk theorizes that the machine is an ancient [[doomsday device|doomsday machine]], which must be stopped before it reaches more populated sectors of the galaxy. The ''Enterprise'' takes the ''Constellation'' in tow and McCoy takes Decker back to the ''Enterprise'', while Scott's damage control team attempt repairs on the ''Constellation''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s impulse engines, weapons and shields. Kirk attends to the ''Constellation''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s nonfunctional viewscreen, which, other than communications from ''Enterprise'', will be his only means of monitoring events outside the ship.

The ''Enterprise's'' first officer, [[Spock]], informs Kirk of the sudden appearance of the so-called planet killer and it begins to pursue the ''Enterprise''. As the boarding party prepares to beam back aboard, the machine attacks the ''Enterprise'', damaging the transporter and disrupting communications. Decker, now the senior officer on the ''Enterprise'', assumes command and orders a phaser attack. The phasers are useless against the machine, and the ship is then caught in a tractor beam which draws it towards the planet killer's maw. Kirk completes his repair of ''Constellation''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s viewscreen and is shocked to see the ''Enterprise'' engaging the machine. Scott has managed to repair impulse engines and recharge one of the ''Constellation'''s phaser banks, so Kirk uses the crippled ship to approach and fire at the planet killer, distracting it long enough for ''Enterprise'' to escape its tractor beam. After repairing the transporter and reestablishing voice communications, ''Enterprise'' retreats to a safe distance. Spock relieves Decker of command on Kirk's orders and Decker is escorted to Sickbay. However, Decker subdues his security escort and steals a [[shuttlecraft (Star Trek)|shuttlecraft]], flying it straight into the maw of the machine. Despite Kirk's plea for him to return to the ''Enterprise'' and his own horror as he is swallowed by the planet killer, he does not deviate from his course and dies.

Lt. [[Hikaru Sulu|Sulu]] reports that the shuttlecraft explosion has reduced the planet killer's power output by a small amount. Realizing that this may have been Decker's intention, and hoping that a starship would do much more damage, Kirk comes up with a plan to explode the ''Constellation'' inside the planet killer. Over Spock's objections, Kirk insists on piloting the damaged ship himself, and Scott rigs the impulse engines to explode with a thirty-second delay before detonation, warning his captain that once the timer is enabled, there is no way to abort it.

With the rest of the boarding party transported back to the ''Enterprise'', Kirk aims the ''Constellation'' at the maw of the planet killer, triggers the timer, and orders the ''Enterprise'' to beam him aboard. The transporter malfunctions, and Scott races to set it right with advice from Spock. With almost no time to spare, Kirk is safely beamed aboard the ''Enterprise'' as the ''Constellation'' explodes inside the planet killer, leaving it dead in space, its threat ended.

==Production==
Episode writer Norman Spinrad based the script on a novelette "The Planet Eater" that had been rejected by a number of publishers. He revived the idea when he had a chance to pitch it to Executive Producer Gene Roddenberry. "I did "The Doomsday Machine" fast," he recalled.&lt;ref&gt;Vinciguerra, Thomas (March 28, 2012).  [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/arts/television/cbs-blocks-use-of-unused-star-trek-script-by-spinrad.html "A 'Trek' Script Is Grounded in Cyberspace."]  ''[[The New York Times]]''.  Retrieved October 7, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Spinrad had written the script with actor [[Robert Ryan]] in mind to play Commodore Decker, but Ryan was unavailable owing to prior commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trekmovie.com/2007/02/10/spinrad-videoblog-on-history-of-doomsday|title=Spinrad VideoBlog On History Of Doomsday|accessdate=December 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources hold that the episode was influenced by [[Fred Saberhagen]]'s series of [[Berserker (Saberhagen)|berserker]] stories,&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, [http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/berserkers Berserkers]&lt;/ref&gt; a series of robotic killing machines built as a [[doomsday device]] by a now-vanished race to wipe out their rivals.&lt;ref&gt;"Fred Saberhagen... was best known for his Berserker series, in which self-replicating robotic probes, a doomsday device left over from a vast interstellar conflict, are programmed to destroy all organic life... The series was an obvious influence on television's Star Trek, in an episode called The Doomsday Machine."  Michael Carlson, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jul/20/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries "Obituary, Fred Saberhagen"], ''The Guardian'', Thursday 19 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, author Norman Spinrad denies the influence&amp;nbsp;— "I wasn't conscious of the Saberhagen stuff when I was doing this, but I was certainly conscious of ''[[Moby-Dick|Moby Dick]]''. And, actually, my unpublished novelette, which was the genesis of ("The Doomsday Machine"), was written before the Saberhagen stuff."&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[StarTrek.com]]|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/doomsday-more-with-norman-spinrad-part-1|title="Doomsday" &amp; More With Norman Spinrad, Part 1|date=March 4, 2012|accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-[[Star Trek canon|canon]] ''Star Trek'' media refer to the device as a Berserker.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Planet_killer Memory Alpha]. ''The Star Trek Concordance'' refers to the device as the "Berserker"; ''The Monsters of Star Trek'' also used the berserker moniker in describing the weapon.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one source the model for the USS ''Constellation'' was an off-the-shelf AMT ''Enterprise'' model painted and torched in places for the battle damage, while other sources claim that the smallest and least detailed ''Enterprise'' professional model was altered for the episode. It has also been stated that the ''Constellation''&amp;apos;s hull ID number of 1017 came from simply switching the digits of an ''Enterprise'' model's 1701 hull numbers.&lt;ref name="OkudaOkuda2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Okuda|first1=Michael|last2=Okuda|first2=Denise|last3=Mirek|first3=Debbie|title=The Star Trek Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbYf2l7gczUC&amp;pg=PT412|accessdate=April 4, 2013|date=May 17, 2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781451646887|pages=412–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was written as a [[bottle episode]], i.e., one that could use existing ship sets to save time and money. According to Spinrad, the episode was so well received by Roddenberry that he commissioned him to write another for comedian [[Milton Berle]] who planned to do a dramatic turn on the show titled "He Walked Among Us".&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;

==Music==
This is one of the few ''Star Trek'' episodes in the second season for which original music was written; in this case a full score, by [[Sol Kaplan]].&lt;ref name="von Schroeck"&gt;{{cite video |url=https://vimeo.com/181693915 |title="The Doomsday Machine" Music Revealed |publisher=[[Vimeo]] |author=Shem von Schroeck |date=6 September 2016 |accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[James Lileks]] notes that the music cues for this episode are "intended to belong together, and that’s one of the reasons the episode works like few others: it has a unique symphonic score. Played start to finish, it holds together."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lileks.com/bleats/archive/04/0904/092404.html |title=LILEKS (James) The Bleat |accessdate=December 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230063325/http://www.lileks.com/bleats/archive/04/0904/092404.html |archivedate=December 30, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Bond]] notes, "Although he wrote only two scores for the series, New York composer Sol Kaplan's music was tracked endlessly throughout the show's first two seasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bond | first = Jeff | title = The Music of Star Trek: Profiles in Style | publisher = Lone Eagle | year = 1999 | isbn = 1580650120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Lileks and Bond point out similarities between this music and [[John Williams]]' award-winning score for ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', nearly a decade later. The music for this episode was collected, along with the score for "[[Amok Time]]", on the second release from Crescendo Records of music from the series: the first release other than the music from the pilot episodes.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:NCC1017.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A scene from the remastered episode "The Doomsday Machine", showing a heavily damaged USS ''Constellation'' produced using CGI technology]] --&gt;

==Non-canon sequels to the episode==
An advanced version of the Planet Killer appears in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' novel ''[[Vendetta (Star Trek)|Vendetta]]''. The novel depicts the original Planet Killer as a prototype for a weapon designed to combat the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]], released in desperation when the weapon's designers realized that the Borg would defeat them before they could finish the more advanced version. In the 2005 episode of  ''[[Star Trek: Phase II (fan series)|Star Trek: New Voyages]]'', "In Harm's Way", [[William Windom (actor)|William Windom]] reprises his role as Commodore Matt Decker almost 40 years later. ''[[Star Trek Online]]'' features the machine in the Federation storyline.

==Reception==
For the franchise's 30th anniversary, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked "The Doomsday Machine" No. 4 on its list of the 10 best ''Star Trek'' episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Logan |first=Michael |date=August 24, 1996 |title=10 Truly Stellar Episodes |magazine=
 [[TV Guide]] |location= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zack Handlen of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode an "A" rating, describing the episode as "very strong stuff", noting effective tension building and the development of Decker's character. Handlen also noted [[Sol Kaplan]]'s score which "matches the actors' intensity."&lt;ref name="AVClub"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Handlen |first=Zack |title="The Apple" / "The Doomsday Machine"|publisher=[[The A.V.

'''The Rock''' is a [[boulder]] on the campus of [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]], United States, located in between University Hall and Harris Hall. It serves as a [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] for campus groups and events, and has been painted with different colors and messages over the years.

==History==
[[File:Northwestern Rock and University Hall.jpg|thumb|The rock in 2009]]
The Rock, a purple-and-white [[quartzite]] boulder, was transplanted from [[Devil's Lake (Wisconsin)|Devil's Lake]], [[Wisconsin]], as a gift of the class of 1902. That graduating class liked the idea of running water on campus "in some form or another" and rigged the Rock to make a fountain on the south end of campus. The original plumbing was later refitted into a water fountain.

The Rock is one of Northwestern's best-known landmarks. While it was originally a fountain, vandalism of the Rock gradually increased, particularly during the [[Vietnam War]]. With the first painting of the rock in the 1940s, it became a canvas for student art, opinions, advertising, messages, proposals, and jokes. Tradition holds that if a student wishes to paint something on the Rock, he or she must guard it from sunrise until the early morning hours (24 hours) before painting. Many student groups start guarding even earlier to ensure that they will be able to claim the Rock for whatever event or date is being advertised.

However, the Rock is no longer one solid piece of quartzite. In 1989 the Rock was moved about 20 feet to accommodate new landscaping. The work crew which was to move the Rock dropped it, splitting it up one side and crumbling part of the base. Scientists at [[Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science|McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science]] provided an epoxy to patch the Rock together again.

==In popular culture==
Author [[Bob Wood (author)|Bob Wood]] discusses "The Rock" in the Northwestern chapter of his 1989 book ''[[Big Ten Country]]''.

'''Upilex''' is a heat-resistant [[polyimide film]]  that is the product of the polycondensation reaction between  biphenyl tetracarboxylic dianhydride ([[BPDA]]) monomers and diamine. Its properties include dimensional stability, low water absorption, high chemical resistance and high mechanical properties (up to 550 MPa depending on film thickness), high heat and chemical resistance.&lt;ref&gt;High Temperature Dielectric Properties of Apical, Kapton, Peek Upilex  
 https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19920019432_1992019432.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by [[UBE Industries]]. 
Upilex-S is the standard grade but other grades include Upilex-RN, VT, CA and SGA. Upilex-S is used when excellent mechanical properties are required, Upilex-RN possesses excellent molding processability, while Upilex-VT has superior heat bonding characteristics. General applications of Upilex include their use in flexible printed circuits, electric motor and generator insulation, high temperature wire and cable wrapping, and specialty pressure sensitive tapes. Polyimides have also been extensively studied in gas and humidity sensors. The concentration is then determined by monitoring the capacitance of modified Upilex films. With the advantages of flexibility and easy functionalization, Upilex films are often used as substrate materials in biosensor platforms. For instance, it is possible to electropolymerize onto these films or attach enzymes to it for the detection of glucose. 

Upilex-S, along with other polyimides [[Kapton]] HN and Kapton E, have been investigated by [[NASA]] with respect to their radiation durability for possible use in the [[Next Generation Space Telescope]], where polymer film layer sunshields must operate at low temperatures and in the presence of [[cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Next Generation Space Telescope Sunshield Materials Titles http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/epbranch/TEMP/epbranch/other/nexttitles.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Flexible superstrate solar cells have been directly grown on commercially available Upilex foils, which makes for lightweight solar cells with a high specific power. Micro-heating elements can be integrated on polyimide sheets, which gives it the benefit of robustness and low-power consumption required for high temperatures. Upilex membranes are not transparent because of their aromatic C-H stretching band, but this can be altered by substituting hydrogen atoms by deuterium atoms.

[[File:Electricbike1raleigh.JPG|thumb|Raleigh SC30 with an aftermarket electric conversion hub motor kit installed.]]
The '''wheel hub motor''' (also called '''wheel motor''', '''wheel hub drive''',  '''hub motor''' or '''in-wheel motor''') is an [[electric motor]] that is incorporated into the [[Wheel#Hub|hub]] of a wheel and drives it directly.

==History==
[[File:Lohner Porsche.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid]], the world's first [[hybrid electric vehicle|gasoline-electric hybrid automobile]], used wheel hub motors.&lt;ref name=HybridCarHist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/history/history-of-hybrid-vehicles.html |title=History of Hybrid Vehicles |publisher=HybridCars.com |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904154040/http://www.hybridcars.com/history/history-of-hybrid-vehicles.html |archivedate=4 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/3456/Lohner-Porsche-Mixte-Voiturette.htmlLohner-Porsche Mixte Voiturette]&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The Adams patent is US # 300,827 in 1884.
* [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT433180&amp;id=1IxYAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=electric+wheel+hub+motor&amp;num=100&amp;as_drrb_ap=b&amp;as_minm_ap=1&amp;as_miny_ap=1776&amp;as_maxm_ap=1&amp;as_maxy_ap=1896#PPP4,M1First Practical wheel motor:] Albert Parcelle of Boston, MA developed the first fully incorporated wheel hub motor in his "Electro-Motor Traction Wheel" and patented it in patent US # 433,180 in 1890.

* [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT572036&amp;id=Es1CAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;dq=572,036&amp;num=100#PPA2-IA1,M1 Electric wheel motor advantages revealed in patent:] An early wheel hub electric motor was invented by Frenchman  Charles Theryc and patented in 1896 as US patent 572,036 entitled Wheel with Electric Motor hub for Vehicles. In the patent he explained all advantages including no transmission losses because of the absence of classic transmission rods from engines to wheels.
* [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT574200&amp;id=6zFHAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;dq=574,200&amp;num=100#PPP1,M1 Diesel wheel motor:] Not all wheel hub motors were electric. C F Goddard in 1896 invented a piston hub motor for horseless carriages patented in US # 574,200. He envisioned it powered by expanding gas of some kind.  His offcenter flexible bent spoke designs later appeared in the Apollo moon rovers' wheels in 1960s.
* [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT593248&amp;id=ab0_AAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;dq=593,248&amp;num=100#PPP1,M1 Using cams, another type of combustion wheel motor:] In patent # 593,248 W C Smith in 1897 developed another explosive gas expansion motor inside a wheel hub that utilized cams on a track in the hub to transmit power to the wheel.

The electric wheel hub motor was raced by [[Ferdinand Porsche]] in 1897 in [[Vienna]], Austria. Porsche's first engineering training was electrical, not internal combustion based. As a result, he developed his first cars as electric cars with electric wheel hub motors that ran on batteries. The [[Lohner Porsche]], fitted with one wheel motor in each of the front wheels, appeared at the [[World Exhibition]] in Paris in 1900 and created a sensation in the young automobile world. In the following years, 300 Lohner Porsches were made and sold to wealthy buyers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.porsche.com/usa/aboutporsche/porschehistory/milestones/&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the growth in power of the gasoline engine overtook the power of the electric wheel hub motors and this made up for any losses through a transmission. As a result, autos moved to gasoline engines with transmissions, but they were never as efficient as electric wheel hub motors.

==Uses in current and future vehicles==
* They are commonly found on [[electric bicycle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electricrider.com/crystalyte/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wheel motors are applied in industry, e.g. driving wheels that are part of assembly lines.
* They have not been used very often on cars, despite being invented for this purpose (see [[#History|history]]).  The only production car using them is the [[MW Motors Luka EV|Luka EV]] by MW Motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lukaev.com/ |title=Luka EV |publisher=MW Motors |access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
Hub motor electromagnetic fields are supplied to the stationary windings of the motor. The outer part of the motor follows, or tries to follow, those fields, turning the attached wheel. In a brushed motor, energy is transferred by brushes contacting the rotating shaft of the motor. Energy is transferred in a brushless motor electronically, eliminating physical contact between stationary and moving parts. Although [[brushless motor]] technology is more expensive, most are more efficient and longer-lasting than brushed motor systems.

A hub motor typically is designed in one of three configurations. Considered least practical is an axial-flux motor, where the stator windings are typically sandwiched between sets of magnets. The other two configurations are both radial designs with the motor magnets bonded to the rotor; in one, the inner rotation motor, the rotor sits inside the stator, as in a conventional motor. In the other, the outer-rotation motor, the rotor sits outside the stator and rotates around it. The application of hub motors in vehicular uses is still evolving, and neither configuration has become standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://machinedesign.com/motorsdrives/designing-hub-brushless-motors|title= Designing In-Hub Brushless Motors |publisher=machinedesign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric motors have their greatest torque at startup, making them ideal for vehicles as they need the most torque at startup too.  The idea of "revving up" so common with internal combustion engines is unnecessary with electric motors.  Their greatest torque occurs as the rotor first begins to turn, which is why electric motors do not require a transmission.  A gear-down arrangement may be needed, but unlike in a transmission normally paired with a combustion engine, no shifting is needed for electric motors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Wheel hub motors are increasingly common on electric bikes and electric scooters in some parts of the world, especially Asia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ebikes.ca/hubmotors.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electricrider.com/crystalyte/motordimensions.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with conventional EV design in automobiles==

Compared with the conventional [[electric vehicle]] design with one motor situated centrally driving two (sometimes four) wheels by axles, the wheel motor arrangement has certain advantages and disadvantages:

===Drive by wire===
[[File:Hiriko 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Hiriko Fold]] pre-production model uses a hub wheel that integrates a motor, steering actuators, suspension and braking right inside the wheel, controlled by a drive-by-wire system.]] 
Cars with electronic control of brakes and acceleration provide more opportunities for computerized vehicle dynamics such as:

* Active cruise control, where the vehicle can maintain a given distance from a vehicle ahead
* Collision avoidance, where the vehicle can automatically brake to avoid a collision
* Emergency brake assist, where the vehicle senses an emergency stop and applies maximum braking
* Active software differentials, where individual wheel speed is adjusted in response to other inputs
* Active brake bias, where individual wheel brake effort is adjusted in real time to maintain vehicle stability
* Brake steer, where individual wheel brake bias is adjusted to assist steering (similar to a tracked vehicle like a [[bulldozer]])

While some of these features have started to appear as options for some internal combustion engine vehicles, optional [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS brakes]] can add up to $2,000 to the cost of a base model.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openroad.com.au/motoring_roadsafety_priceofsafety.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

As wheel motors brake and accelerate a vehicle with a single solid state electric/electronic system many of the above features can be added as software upgrades rather than requiring additional systems/hardware be installed like with ABS etc. This should lead to cheaper active dynamic safety systems for wheel motor equipped road vehicles.

===Weight savings===
Eliminating mechanical transmission, including gearboxes, differentials, drive shafts, and axles, provides a significant weight and manufacturing cost saving, while also decreasing the environmental impact of the product.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Unsprung weight concerns===

The major disadvantage of a wheel hub motor is that the weight of the electric motor increases the [[unsprung weight]], which adversely affects handling and ride. The wheels are more sluggish in responding to road conditions, especially fast motions over bumps, and transmit the bumps to the chassis instead of absorbing them. 

Most conventional electric motors include ferrous material composed of laminated [[electrical steel]]. This ferrous material contributes most of the weight of electric motors. To minimize this weight, several recent wheel-motor designs have minimized the electrical steel content of the motor by using [[Electric motor#Ironless or coreless rotor motor|a coreless design]] with [[Litz wire]] coil windings to reduce [[eddy current]] losses. This significantly reduces wheel motor weight and therefore unsprung weight.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Another method used is to replace the cast iron friction brake assembly with a wheel motor assembly of similar weight. This results in no net gain in unsprung weight and provides a car capable of braking up to 1G.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uTR-8KarE&lt;/ref&gt;  

A good example of this is the Michelin [[Active Wheel]] motor as fitted to the [[Heuliez]] Will, the first electric car with an Active Wheel drive, which results in an unsprung weight of 35&amp;nbsp;kg on the front axle and which compares favorably to a small car such as a Renault Clio that has 38&amp;nbsp;kg of unsprung weight on its front axle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.causecast.org/news_items/7667-michelin-unveils-active-wheel-in-affordable-electric-car&lt;/ref&gt;
