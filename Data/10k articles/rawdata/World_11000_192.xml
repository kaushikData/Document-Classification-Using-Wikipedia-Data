      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2023">'''Baloz''' or '''bajloz''' is a sea monster in [[Albanian mythology]].

==Etymology==
[[Maximilian Lambertz]] suggested that the word derived from Italian ''[[bailo]]'', the title of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]].&lt;ref name=Elsie&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Elsie|author2=Janice Mathie-Heck|title=Songs of the Frontier Warriors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5xgxBY81S7IC&amp;pg=PA367|year=2004|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|isbn=978-0-86516-412-3|pages=367–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literally, the word seems to have originated from the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] ''blozë''(soot), referring to baloz's armour color, or maybe from [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word "balyoz" meaning "hammer", maybe due to the hammers of war the baloz carried.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Folklore==
Baloz (as a character) has been found in many Albanian myths and legends about fighting against the Albanian nobles such as: Muji, Halili, [[Gjergj Elez Alia]] and [[Constantin and Doruntinë|Constantin]]. The monster is found in the [[Albanian Songs of the Frontier Warriors]].&lt;ref name=Elsie/&gt;

Detailed descriptions have been found in a collection of Albanian myths named ''Ancient Albanian Tales'' ({{lang-sq|Tregime të Moçme Shqiptare}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tregime të moçme shqiptare
 |last=Kuteli |first=Mitrush |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1987 |publisher=Naim Frasheri |location=Tirana |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10rhAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=P%C3%ABrralla+t%C3%AB+Mo%C3%A7me+Shqiptare&amp;dq=P%C3%ABrralla+t%C3%AB+Mo%C3%A7me+Shqiptare&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eyQ2TNnWI8T68AbGw5GDDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6wEwAQ |accessdate=2010-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; collected and rewritten by [[Dhimitër Pasko]].

'''Baloz Sedelija''' was a Slavic warrior in Albanian folklore.&lt;ref name=Elsie/&gt; Another character was '''Baloz(i) i Zi'''.

[[File:Countries by Birth Rate in 2017.svg|thumb|450px|Countries by crude birth rate (CBR) in 2017.]]
The '''birth rate''' (technically, births/population rate) is the total number of live births per 1,000 in a population in a year or period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/world/birth_rate.html |title=World Birth rate – Demographics |publisher=Indexmundi.com |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of births in a population is calculated in several ways: live births from a universal registration system for births, deaths, and marriages; population counts from a [[census]], and estimation through specialized [[Demographics|demographic]] techniques. The birth rate (along with [[mortality rate|mortality]] and [[human migration|migration]] rate) are used to calculate [[population growth]].

The ''crude birth rate'' is the number of live births per year per 1,000 mid-year population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20451597~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html|title=Data - Population and Demographic Indicators|website=econ.worldbank.org|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See "[[Fertility rates]]"; Economic Geography Glossary at University of Washington&lt;/ref&gt; Another term used interchangeably with ''birth rate'' is ''natality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/birthrate |title=birthrate – definition of birthrate by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[crude death rate]] is subtracted from the crude birth rate, the result is the [[rate of natural increase]] (RNI).&lt;ref name="worldbank1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.CBRT.IN |title=Birth rate, crude (per 1,000 people) &amp;#124; Data &amp;#124; Table |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is equal to the rate of population change (excluding migration).&lt;ref name="worldbank1"/&gt;

The total (crude) birth rate (which includes all births)—typically indicated as births per 1,000 population—is distinguished from an age-specific rate (the number of births per 1,000 persons in an age group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/birth-rate |title=birthrate: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known use of the term "birth rate" in English occurred in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/birthrate |title=Birthrate – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The birth rate is an issue of concern and policy for national governments. Some (including those of [[Italy]] and [[Malaysia]]) seek to increase the birth rate with financial incentives or provision of support services to new mothers. Conversely, other countries have policies to reduce the birth rate (for example, China's [[one-child policy]] which was in effect from 1978 to 2015). Policies to increase the crude birth rate are known as pro-natalist policies, and policies to reduce the crude birth rate are known as anti-natalist policies. Measures such as improved information on [[birth control]] and its availability have achieved similar results in countries such as [[Family planning in Iran|Iran]].

There has also been discussion on whether bringing women into the forefront of development initiatives will lead to a decline in birth rates. In some countries, government policies have focused on reducing birth rates by improving women's rights, sexual and [[reproductive health]]. Typically, high birth rates are associated with health problems, low [[life expectancy]], low living standards, low [[social status]] for women and low educational levels. [[Demographic transition]] theory postulates that as a country undergoes [[economic development]] and social change its population growth declines, with birth rates serving as an indicator.

At the 1974 [[World Population Conference]] in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], [[Women's rights#Modern movements|women's issues]] gained considerable attention. Family programs were discussed, and 137 countries drafted a World Population Plan of Action. As part of the discussion, many countries accepted modern [[birth control]] methods such as the [[birth control pill]] and the [[condom]] while opposing [[abortion]]. Population and the need to incorporate women into the discourse were discussed; it was agreed that improvements in women's status and initiatives in defense of reproductive health and freedom, the environment, and sustainable socioeconomic development were needed.

Birth rates ranging from 10–20 births per 1,000 are considered low, while rates from 40–50 births per 1,000 are considered high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childtrends.org/?indicators=fertility-and-birth-rates|title=Fertility and Birth Rates|date=2015-03-24|website=Child Trends|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are problems associated with both extremes. High birth rates may stress government welfare and family programs. Additional problems faced by a country with a high birth rate include educating a growing number of children, creating jobs for these children when they enter the workforce, and dealing with the environmental impact of a large population. Low birth rates may stress the government to provide adequate senior welfare systems and stress families who must support the elders themselves. There will be fewer children (and a working-age population) to support an aging population.

== Coercive population control ==
In the 20th century, several authoritarian governments have sought either to increase or to decrease the birth rates, often through forceful intervention. One of the most notorious [[natalist]] policies is that which occurred in [[communist Romania]] in the period of 1967-1990 during communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], who adopted a very aggressive natalist policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people. This period has later been depicted in movies and documentaries (such as ''[[4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days]]'', ''[[Children of the Decree]]''). These policies temporarily increased birth rates for a few years, but this was followed by a later decline due to an increased use of [[illegal abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/6/590 |title=Europe the continent with the lowest fertility &amp;#124; Human Reproduction Update &amp;#124; Oxford Academic |website=Humupd.oxfordjournals.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mihai Horga1 |author2=Caitlin Gerdts |author3=Malcolm Potts |url=http://jfprhc.bmj.com/content/39/1/2.full |title=The remarkable story of Romanian women's struggle to manage their fertility &amp;#124; Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Healthcare |website=Jfprhc.bmj.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceaușescu's policy resulted in over 9,000 women who died due to illegal abortions,&lt;ref name="Kligman short"&gt;Kligman, Gail.

The irony of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu|Ceaușescu's]] aggressive natalist policy was a generation that may not have been born would eventually lead the [[Romanian Revolution]] which would overthrow and have him [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu#Execution|executed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Freakonomics|last=Levitt &amp; Dubner|first=Steven &amp; Stephen|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2005|isbn=9780141019017|location=80 Strand, London WC2R ORL England|page=107|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In stark opposition with Ceaușescu's natalist policy was China's [[one child policy]], in effect from 1978 to 2015, which included abuses such as [[forced abortion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-18435126 |title=China forced abortion photo sparks outrage - BBC News |website=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy has also been deemed responsible for the common practice of [[sex selective abortion]] which led to an imbalanced [[sex ratio]] in the country. Given strict family-size limitations and a preference for sons, girls have become unwanted in China because they are considered as depriving the parents of the possibility of having a son. With the progress of prenatal sex-determination technologies and induced abortion, the one-child policy gradually turned into a one-son policy.&lt;ref name="Bulte, Heerink, &amp; Zhang, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulte, E., Heerink, N., &amp; Zhang, X.|title=China’s one-child policy and ‘the mystery of missing women’: ethnic minorities and male-biased sex ratios.|journal=Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics|year=2011|volume=73|issue=1|pages=0305–9049|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00601.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, the steady decline in birth rates over the past decades can be greatly attributed to the significant gains in women's freedoms, such as tackling the phenomenon of [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]], education for women and increased socioeconomic opportunities. Women of all economic, social, religious and educational persuasions are choosing to have fewer children as they are gaining more control over their own [[reproductive rights]]. Apart from more children living into their adult years, women are often more ambitious to take up work, education and living their own lives rather than just a life of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=People Quake|last=Pearse|first=Fred|publisher=Eden Project Books|year=2010|isbn=9781905811342|location=61-63 Uxbridge Road, London W5 5SA|pages=P131|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birth rates in third world countries have fallen due to the introduction of [[family planning]] clinics.

In Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world, women are on average having two children less often than they did before 1999, according to Australian demographer Jack Caldwell. Bangladeshi women eagerly took up contraceptives, like condoms and the pill, on offer from a foreign population agency in a study by the World Bank carried out in 1994. The study proved that family planning could be carried out and accepted practically anywhere. Caldwell also believes that agricultural improvements led to the need for less labour. Children not needed to plough the fields would be of surplus and require some education, so in turn, smaller families, and with smaller families, women are able to work and have greater ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=People Quake|last=Pearse|first=Fred|publisher=Eden Project Books|year=2010|isbn=9781905811342|location=61-63 Uxbridge Road, London W5 5SA|pages=P133-136|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Myanmar]], a country which until 2011 was controlled by an austere military junta, intent on controlling every aspect of its population's lives. The military generals wanted the country's population doubled. In their view, The women's job was to produce babies to power the country's labour force, so family planning was vehemently opposed. The women of Burma opposed this policy, and Peter McDonald of the Australian National University argues that this gave rise to a [[black market]] trade in contraception, all smuggled from neighbouring Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=People Quake|last=Pearse|first=Fred|publisher=Eden Project Books|year=2010|isbn=9781905811342|location=61-63 Uxbridge Road, London W5 5SA|pages=P136|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, five years after the war ended, Iran saw the fastest recorded drop in fertility in world history. Revolution gave way to consumerism and westernization. With TVs and cars came condoms and the pill. A generation of women expected to produce soldiers in the fight against Iraq was met by the next generation of women who had a choice to enjoy some new found luxuries. In the years during the Iran/Iraq war, the women of Iran averaged about 8 children each, a ratio the hard line Islamic President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wanted to revive. As of 2010, the birth rate of Iran is 1.7 babies per woman. Some may say this is a triumph of western values, which give women more freedoms, over an Islamic ruled state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=People Quake|last=Pearse|first=Fred|publisher=Eden Project Books|year=2010|isbn=9781905811342|location=61-63 Uxbridge Road, London W5 5SA|pages=P137-139|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic clerics are having less influence over women in other Muslim countries also. In the past 30 years Turkey`s fertility rate of children per woman has dropped from 4.07 to 2.08. Tunisia has dropped from 4.82 to 2.14 and Morocco from 5.4 to 2.52 children per woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/australia-population/|title=worldmeters|last=Staff|first=|date=22 October 2016|website=www.worldmeters.info|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin America, of predominately Catholic faith, has seen the same trends in falling fertility rates. Brazilian women are having half the children they were 25 years ago with a rate of 2.2 children per woman. The Vatican is having less influence over women in other hard-line Catholic countries also. Mexico, El Salvador, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Venezuela and Peru have all seen significant drops in fertility in the same period, all going from over six to less than three children per woman. Forty percent of married Brazilian women are choosing to get sterilised after having children, but this may be a compromise as it is only one confession of sin to the church. Some may say this is a triumph of Western values, which give women more freedoms, over a Catholic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=People Quake|last=Pearse|first=Fred|publisher=Eden Project Books|year=2010|isbn=9781905811342|location=61-62 Uxbridge Road, London W5 5SA|pages=P140|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
The region of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] has the highest birth rate in the world.

=== Australia ===
Historically, [[Australia]] has had a relatively low fertility rate, reaching a high of 3.14 births per woman in 1960.&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/australia-population/|title=Australian Population|last=Staff|first=|date=2016-10-23|website=www.worldometers.info|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a decline which continued until the mid-2000, when a one off cash incentive was introduced to reverse the decline. In 2004, the then [[Howard government]] introduced a non-means tested 'Maternity Payment' to parents of every newborn as a substitute to maternity leave. The payment known as the 'Baby Bonus' was A$3000 per child. This rose to A$5000 which was paid in 13 instalments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mccrindle.com.au/the-mccrindle-blog/the-baby-bonus-generation|title=The Baby Bonus Generation|last=Staff|first=|date=2013-05-15|website=www.mccrindle.com.au|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a time when Australia's unemployment was at a 28-year low of 5.2%, the then Treasurer [[Peter Costello]] stated there was opportunity to go lower. With a good economic outlook for Australia, Costello held the view that now was a good time to expand the population, with his famous quote that every family should have three children "one for mum, one for dad and one for the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2004/s1261874.htm|title=ABC TV Transcript|last=Costello|first=Peter|date=2004-12-09|website=www.abc.net.au|publisher=Australian Broadcast Commission|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's fertility rate reached a peak of 1.95 children per woman in 2010, a 30-year high,&lt;ref name="Staff"/&gt; although still [[Sub-replacement fertility|below replacement rate]].

Phil Ruthven of the business information firm IBISWorld believes the spike in fertility was more about timing and less about monetary incentives. Generation X was now aged 25 to 45 years old. With numerous women putting pregnancies off for a few years for the sake of a career, many felt the years closing in and their biological clocks ticking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2007/s1963979.htm|title=ABC Radio Transcript|last=Ruthven|first=Phil|date=2007-06-27|website=www.abc.net.au|publisher=Australian Broadcast Commission|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 2014, the baby bonus was replaced with Family Tax Benefit A. By then the baby bonus had left its legacy on Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mccrindle.com.au/the-mccrindle-blog/the-baby-bonus-generation|title=The McCrindle Blog|last=Staff|first=|date=2013-05-15|website=www.mccrindle.com.au|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Australia's fertility rate has only decreased slightly to 1.91 children per woman.&lt;ref name="Staff"/&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Canada&lt;/big&gt;'''

{{cns|date=November 2018|text=Canada's birthrate is 1.60 births per woman as of 2015, more closely resembling a European country than Australia or the USA.}}

=== France ===
[[France]] has been successful in increasing fertility rates from the low levels seen in the late 1980s, after a continuous fall in the birth rate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=이(Yi)|first=문숙(Moun Souk)|date=Winter 2016|title=프랑스의 저출산 문제 해소 요인 (Resolved Factors to Low Fertility in France)|url=|journal=한국콘텐츠학회논문지(Journal of the Korea contents association)|volume=16 |issue=1|pages=558|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the total fertility rate was as low as 1.66, but perhaps due to the active family policy of the government in the mid 1990s, it has increased, and maintained an average of 2.0 average from 2008 until 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

France has embarked on a strong incentive policy based on two key measures to restore the birth rate: family benefits (''les allocations familiales'') and a family-coefficient of income tax (''le quotient familial'').&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=이(Yi)|first=문숙(Moun Souk)|date=Winter 2016|title=프랑스의 저출산 문제 해소 요인 (Resolved Factors to Low Fertility in France)|url=|journal=한국콘텐츠학회논문지(Journal of the Korea contents association)|volume=16 |issue=1|pages=561|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of World War II, early family policy in France has been based on a family tradition that requires children to support multi-child family, so that a third child enables a multi-child family to benefit from family allowances and income tax exemptions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is intended to allow families with three children to enjoy the same living standards as households without children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In particular, the French income taxation system is structured so that families with children receive tax breaks greater than single adults without children.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=이(Yi)|first=문숙(Moun Souk)|date=Winter 2016|title=프랑스의 저출산 문제 해소 요인 (Resolved Factors to Low Fertility in France)|url=|journal=한국콘텐츠학회논문지(Journal of the Korea contents association)|volume=16 |issue=1|pages=562|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This income tax imposition system is known as the family coefficient of income tax.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A characteristic of the family factor is that households with a large number of children, even if they are at the same standard of living, can receive more tax exemption benefits.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Since the 1970s, the focus has been on supporting families who are vulnerable such as single parent families and the children of a poor family in order to ensure equality of opportunity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=이(Yi)|first=문숙(Moun Souk)|date=Winter 2016|title=프랑스의 저출산 문제 해소 요인 (Resolved Factors to Low Fertility in France)|url=|journal=한국콘텐츠학회논문지(Journal of the Korea contents association)|volume=16 |issue=1|pages=563|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as many women began to participate in the labor market, the government introduced policies of financial support for childcare leave as well as childcare facilities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1994, the government expanded the parent education allowance (''l'allocation parentale d'éducation'') for women with two children to ensure freedom of choice and reduce formal unemployment in order to promote family well-being and women's labor participation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There are also:
* an infant child care allowance, family allowance and family allowance for multichild family, and a multi-element family pension scheme.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=이(Yi)|first=문숙(Moun Souk)|date=Winter 2016|title=프랑스의 저출산 문제 해소 요인 (Resolved Factors to Low Fertility in France)|url=|journal=한국콘텐츠학회논문지(Journal of the Korea contents association)|volume=16 |issue=1|pages=564|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The birth rate in [[Germany]] is only 8.3 per thousand—so low that the UK and France (which have smaller populations) had more births in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2011/0809/1224302081071.html | work=The Irish Times | title=Germany faces up to its kinder surprise | date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In Europe as of July 2011, Ireland's birth rate was 16.5 per 1000 (3.5 percent higher than the next-ranked country, the UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Susan Daly |url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-has-one-of-highest-birth-and-lowest-death-rates-in-eu-189080-Jul2011/ |title=Ireland has one of highest birth and lowest death rates in EU · TheJournal |publisher=Thejournal.ie |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, [[Japan]] has the third lowest crude birth rate (i.e. not allowing for the population's age distribution) in the world, with only [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] and [[Monaco]] having lower crude birth rates.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; Japan has an unbalanced population with many elderly but few young people, and the this is projected to be more extreme in the future, unless there are major changes. An increasing number of Japanese people are staying unmarried: between 1980 and 2010, the percentage of the population who had never married increased from 22% to almost 30%, even as the population continued to age, and by 2035 one in four people will not marry during their childbearing years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yoshida|first1=Reiji|title=Japan’s population dilemma, in a single-occupancy nutshell|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/12/31/national/social-issues/japans-population-dilemma-single-occupancy-nutshell/|accessdate=14 January 2016|work=The Japan Times|date=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese sociologist [[Masahiro Yamada]] coined the term "[[parasite single]]s" for unmarried adults in their late 20s and 30s who continue to live with their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wiseman |first=Paul |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-06-02-japan-women-usat_x.htm |title=USATODAY.com - No sex please we're Japanese |website=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date=2004-06-02 |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
In August 2011 Taiwan's government announced that its birth rate declined in the previous year, despite the fact that the government implemented approaches to encourage fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sui |first=Cindy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14525525 |title=BBC News – Taiwanese birth rate plummets despite measures |publisher=BBC |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In July 2011, the UK's [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) announced a 2.4 percent increase in live births in the UK in 2010.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/13/more-midwives-birth-rate-40-year-high |title=Call for more midwives as birth rate reaches 40-year high &amp;#124; Society &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=17 October 2011 |date=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the highest birth rate in the UK in 40 years.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; However, the UK record year for births and birth rate remains 1920 (when the ONS reported over 957,000 births to a population of "around 40 million").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16853368|title=Go Figure: When was the real baby boom?|publisher=BBC news magazine|author=Michael Blastland|date=2 February 2012|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
According to U.S. federal-government data released in March 2011, births fell four percent from 2007 to 2009 (the largest drop in the U.S. for any two-year period since the 1970s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/31/news/la-heb-us-birth-rate-falls-20110331 |title=Us Birth Rate &amp;#124; U.S. birth rate: Drop in birth rate is the biggest in 30 years – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |first=Shari |last=Roan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, North Dakota had the nation's lowest unemployment rate (3.1 percent) and was the only state to show an increase (0.7 percent) in its birth rate. All other states either remained the same or declined.

The research center's study also found evidence of a correlation between economic difficulties and fertility decline by race and ethnicity. Hispanics (particularly affected by the recession) have experienced the largest fertility decline, particularly compared to Caucasians (who have less economic hardship and a smaller decline in fertility). In 2008–2009 the birth rate declined 5.9 percent for Hispanic women, 2.4 percent for African American women and 1.6 percent for white women. The relatively large birth rate declines among Hispanics mirror their relatively large economic declines, in terms of jobs and wealth. According to the statistics using the data from National Centre for Health Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau, from 2007 to 2008, the employment rate among Hispanics declined by 1.6 percentage points, compared with declines of 0.7 points for whites. The unemployment rate shows a similar pattern—unemployment among Hispanics increased 2.0 percentage points from 2007 to 2008, while for whites the increase was 0.9 percentage points. A recent report from the Pew Hispanic Center revealed that Hispanics have also been the biggest losers in terms of wealth since the beginning of the recession, with Hispanic households losing 66% of their median wealth from 2005 to 2009. In comparison, black households lost 53% of their median wealth and white households lost only 16%. In facts, Hispanics, who have been hit the hardest in terms of employment and wealth, have also experienced the largest fertility declines since the onset of the recession because the birth rate declines of Hispanic women is the highest while comparing to the White women. Since, the unemployment rate has been increasing, the birth rate decline has been decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Livingston|first1=Gretchen|title=In a Down Economy, Fewer Births|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/10/12/in-a-down-economy-fewer-births/|website=Pew Research Center|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors (such as women's labor-force participation, contraceptive technology and public policy) make it difficult to determine how much economic change affect fertility. Research suggests that much of the fertility decline during an economic downturn is a postponement of childbearing, not a decision to have fewer (or no) children; people plan to "catch up" to their plans of bearing children when economic conditions improve. Younger women are more likely than older women to postpone pregnancy due to economic factors, since they have more years of fertility remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/10/12/in-a-down-economy-fewer-births/?src=prc-headline |title=In a Down Economy, Fewer Births &amp;#124; Pew Research Center |website=Pewsocialtrends.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the [[U.S. National Institutes of Health]] announced that the adolescent birth rate continues to decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jul2011/nichd-07.htm |title=Federal report shows drop in adolescent birth rate, July 7, 2011 News Release – National Institutes of Health (NIH) |publisher=Nih.gov |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, teenage birth rates in the U.S. were at the lowest level in U.S. history.&lt;ref name="Cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/about/index.htm |title=About Teen Pregnancy |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teen birth rates in the U.S. have decreased from 1991 through 2012 (except for an increase from 2005–2007).&lt;ref name="Cdc.gov"/&gt; The other aberration from this otherwise-steady decline in teen birth rates is the six percent decrease in birth rates for 15- to 19-year-olds between 2008 and 2009.&lt;ref name="Cdc.gov"/&gt;&lt;!--This does not make sense.--&gt; Despite the decrease, U.S. teen birth rates remain higher than those in other developed nations.&lt;ref name="Cdc.gov"/&gt; Racial differences affect teen birth and pregnancy rates: American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic black teen pregnancy rates are more than double the non-Hispanic white teenage birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/features/dsTeenPregnancy/#source |title=CDC Data &amp; Statistics &amp;#124; Feature: Teen Birth Rates Declined Again in 2009 |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=1 July 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States strict in enforcing child support have up to 20 percent fewer unmarried births than states that are lax about getting unmarried dads to pay, the researchers found. Moreover, according to the results, if all 50 states in the United States had done at least as well in their enforcement efforts as the state ranked fifth from the top, that would have led to a 20 percent reduction in out-of-wedlock births.&lt;ref name="archive1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=10608 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505175913/http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=10608 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-05-05 |title=uwnews.org &amp;#124; Tough child support laws may deter single men from becoming fathers, study finds &amp;#124; University of Washington News and Information |date= |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States population growth is at an historical low level as the United States current birth rates are the lowest ever recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baby bust: U.S. births at record low|url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/06/news/economy/birth-rate-low/|publisher=CNN|date=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low birth rates in the contemporary United States can possibly be ascribed to the recession, which led women to postpone having children and fewer immigrants coming to the US. The current US birth rates are not high enough to maintain the size of the U.S. population, according to [[The Economist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=

==Factors affecting birth rate==
{{Main|Fertility factor (demography)}}
[[File:2018 UN Human Development Report.svg|thumb|[[Human Development Index]] map. Darker is higher. Countries with a higher HDI usually have a lower birth rate, known as the [[Income and fertility|fertility-income paradox]].]]
There are many factors that interact in complex ways, influencing the births rate of a population.
[[Developed countries]] have a lower birth rate than [[underdeveloped countries]] (see [[Income and fertility]]). A parent's number of children strongly correlates with the number of children that each person in the next generation will eventually have.&lt;ref name="Murphy2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Michael|title=Cross-National Patterns of Intergenerational Continuities in Childbearing in Developed Countries|journal=Biodemography and Social Biology|volume=59|issue=2|year=2013|pages=101–126|issn=1948-5565|doi=10.1080/19485565.2013.833779}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors generally associated with increased fertility include [[religiosity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1353/sof.0.0000| title = Religiosity and Fertility in the United States: The Role of Fertility Intentions| journal = Social Forces| volume = 86| issue = 3| page = 1163| year = 2008| last1 = Hayford | first1 = S.

Many of these factors however are not universal, and differ by region and social class. For instance, at a global level, religion is correlated with increased fertility, but in the West less so: Scandinavian countries and France are among the least religious in the EU, but have the highest TFR, while the opposite is true about Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, Poland and Spain.
(see [[Religion in the European Union]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdde220&amp;plugin=0 |title=Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table |website=Ec.europa.eu |date=2016-08-11 |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reproductive health]] can also affect the birth rate, as untreated infections can lead to fertility problems, as can be seen in the "infertility belt" - a region that stretches across central Africa from the United Republic of Tanzania in the east to Gabon in the west, and which has a lower fertility than other African regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/88/12/10-011210/en/|title=WHO - Mother or nothing: the agony of infertility|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=2900173 | volume=26 | title=Infertility in Central Africa: infection is the cause | year=1988 | journal=Int J Gynaecol Obstet | pages=423–8 | last1 = Collet | first1 = M | last2 = Reniers | first2 = J | last3 = Frost | first3 = E | last4 = Gass | first4 = R | last5 = Yvert | first5 = F | last6 = Leclerc | first6 = A | last7 = Roth-Meyer | first7 = C | last8 = Ivanoff | first8 = B | last9 = Meheus | first9 = A | doi=10.1016/0020-7292(88)90340-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Child custody laws, affecting fathers' parental rights over their children from birth until child custody ends at age 18, may have an effect on the birth rate. [[U.S. state]]s strict in enforcing [[child support]] have up to 20 percent fewer unmarried births than states that are lax about getting unmarried fathers to pay, the researchers found. Moreover, according to the results, if all 50 states in the United States had done at least as well in their enforcement efforts as the state ranked fifth from the top, that would have led to a 20 percent reduction in out-of-wedlock births.&lt;ref name="archive1"/&gt;

'''''Brulion''''' (meaning ''Rough Sketchbook'' in English) was a [[Polish language]] quarterly literary [[magazine]] published in Poland from 1986 to 1999.

==History and profile==
''Brulion'' was established by a group led by Robert Tekieli in [[Kraków]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="Phillips2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ursula Phillips|title=Polish Literature in Transformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFNeAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA252|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=25 January 2013|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-90289-4|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mathe&gt;{{cite book|author1=Matthias Schwartz|author2=Heike Winkel|title=Eastern European Youth Cultures in a Global Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWT-CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=24 April 2016|edition=mathe|date=30 November 2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-38513-0|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine, published quarterly, ceased publication in 1999.&lt;ref name=Phillips2013/&gt;

Its [[editor in chief]] was also Robert Tekieli. Originally a quarterly of the alternative and semi-legal [[Polish culture]], it became known for respecting no taboos and producing scandals since its ninth issue, thus becoming the voice of the [[Resistance movement|underground]], [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] Poland. The generation of ''brulion'' writers was influenced mainly by [[List of poets from the United States|American poets]] like [[Frank O'Hara]] (that is why they're often called ''o´harists''), [[Allen Ginsberg]] or [[John Ashbery]], translated by Pietr Sommer. Another translator, Stanisław Barańczak, introduced to Poland the poetry of [[Philip Larkin]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[Robert Frost]] and others. ''Brulion'' published among others an almanac named ''Przyszli barbarzyńci'' (''Future barbarians''; the title comes from a poem by [[Konstantinos Kavafis|Cavafy]]). Therefore, the ''brulion'' generation is also known as ''barbarians''.&lt;ref name="mathe"/&gt;

[[File:retablemonaco.jpg |thumb|''Altarpiece of St Nicolas - [[Ludovico Brea]], 1500'']]
The '''Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate''' (in [[French language]]: ''Cathédrale de Notre-Dame-Immaculée''), but sometimes called '''Saint Nicholas Cathedral''' (name of the old church which was demolished in 1874),&lt;ref name=wondermondo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/E/Small/Monaco/MonacoCathedral.htm|title=Monaco Cathedral|publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Monaco Cathedral''' (French: ''Cathédrale de Monaco''), is the cathedral of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Monaco]] in [[Monaco-Ville]], [[Monaco]], where many of the [[House of Grimaldi|Grimaldis]] were buried, including [[Grace Kelly]] and—more recently—[[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Rainier III]].

The cathedral was built in 1875–1903 and consecrated in 1911, and is on the site of the first parish church in Monaco built in 1252 and dedicated to Saint Nicholas.  Of note are the [[retable]] (circa 1500) to the right of the transept, the Great Altar and the Episcopal throne in white [[Carrara marble]].

Pontifical services take place on the major religious festivals, such as the Feast of [[Devota|Sainte Dévote]] (27 January) and the national holiday (19 November). On feast days and during religious music concerts, one can hear the magnificent four-keyboard organ, inaugurated in 1976.

From September through June, “Les Petits Chanteurs de Monaco” and the singers of the Cathedral Choir School sing during Mass every Sunday at 10:00am. Mass is also celebrated here each year on 6 December, when primary children gather for a joyful remembrance of St. Nicholas' life.

The '''Central African National Liberation Movement''' ({{lang-fr|Mouvement Centrafricain de Libération Nationale}}, MCLN), was a political opposition movement in the [[Central African Republic]] led by Rodolphe Iddi Lala. The party had an armed wing, the Forces Armées de Libération Militaire.

==History==
Lala was expelled from [[Abel Goumba]]'s [[Ubangian Popular Front]] in 1980, and subsequently formed the MCLN on 30 December 1980.&lt;ref name=EISA/&gt; On July 14, 1981 MCLN bombed a popular cinema in [[Bangui]]. Three people were killed and several others injured. MCLN took responsibility for the act and claimed that such attacks would only be stopped if French troops withdrew. The regime answered by banning MCLN and several other (more peaceful) opposition groups.&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, Thomas. ''The Central African Republic: The Continent's Hidden Heart''. Boulder: Westview Press, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

MCLN was supported by [[Libya]]. Claimed links to MCLN was often used by the regime to dislegimitize the major opposition forces in the country. The party was banned on 18 July 1981.&lt;ref name=EISA&gt;[http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/car-defunct-political-parties CAR: Defunct political parties] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113912/http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/car-defunct-political-parties |date=April 2, 2015 }} EISA&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a new movement going by the same name was formed. Media reports connect the new ''MNLC'' to outbursts of violence in the Central African Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/car-violence-rises-shot-children-husband-180211091014962.html CAR violence rises: 'They shot my children and husband']. [[Al Jazeera]], 12 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; NGO [[International Crisis Group]] reports that "clashes between armed groups National Movement for the Liberation of the Central African Republic (MNLC) and Revolution and Justice (RJ) intensified" in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crisisgroup.org/crisiswatch/january-2018#central-african-republic Crisis Watch: Central African Republic].

The '''Centre Party '86''', ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Centrumpartij '86''; abbr. '''CP’86'''), was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[far-right]] political party which existed between 1986 and 1998. The party was a more radical splinter from the [[Centre Party (Netherlands)|Centre Party]] and was established on 20 May 1986 and was disestablished on 18 November 1998, before an [[Amsterdam]] court ruled the party to be illegal. The [[New National Party (Netherlands)|NNP]] split off from the CP'86 in turn, several key people of that party had been prominent CP'86 members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1244">'''European Cultural Month''' is an event created by the [[European Union]] to promote [[culture]]. It is similar to the [[European City of Culture]], but lasting for a shorter time and intended mainly for the [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] European countries. It was launched in 1990.  

The event has currently been suspended. It is possible that it may resume, but would only take place in European cities not in countries which are members of the EU, which are therefore ineligible to be nominated as European city of culture.&lt;ref name="Culture Month"&gt;{{cite web |title=European Culture Month |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/eac/ecocs/present_cap/retrospective_en.html |accessdate=2008-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202062436/http://ec.europa.eu/culture/eac/ecocs/present_cap/retrospective_en.html |archivedate=2008-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not to be confused with [http://www.euintheus.org/event/european-month-of-culture/ European Month of Culture], an initiative of the EU Delegation to the United States, which has run every May since 2013.

'''''Friday Night'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film-center.si/index.php?module=fdb&amp;op=film&amp;filmID=2288|title=Slovenian Film Center, Friday Night}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-sl|V petek zvečer}}) is a Slovenian low-budget film that premiered in theaters across [[Slovenia]] in 2000. Directed by [[Danijel Sraka]]; written by [[Beno 'Stef' Torkar]]; produced by [[Ales Blatnik]] and Danijel Sraka. The film received extensive media coverage in Slovenia during filming as a result of being privately financed and having an international crew when most films from the area where dependent on state funds and local workers.

The crew members brought in from abroad where [[Mikael Karlmark]] from Sweden, [[Roy Kurtluyan]] from [[Turkey]]/United States, [[Donald L. Painchaud]] from Canada and [[James Debbs]] from the United States.

==Summary==

High school friends Edi, Marko, Katja, Mateja, and Petra are trying to find their way to graduation. Along the way they encounter extremely hostile teachers, offensive policemen, insane parents, and at one point aliens (?!). Will they succeed in reaching their goal: the ultimate 'be here or die' party?

Although [[vowel length]] is typically contrastive in [[Omotic languages]], Ganza does not have a clear contrast between long and short vowel phonemes. Instead, Ganza has predictable utterance-final vowel
lengthening and a set of monosyllabic words with double vowels.&lt;ref name="Smolders-2016"/&gt;{{rp|109}}

{{Grand Armee Corps}}

The '''II Corps''' of the [[Grande Armée]] was a military unit that existed during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

==The Campaigns==
At its formation in 1805, [[Auguste de Marmont]] was appointed commander of the corps. 

===The War Of The Third Coalition===
It participated in the [[Ulm Campaign]] before advancing southeast to serve as a flank guard. Still under Marmont, the troops then served as the garrison of the [[Illyrian Provinces]] until 1809 when they became the ''Army of Dalmatia'' and later the [[XI Corps (Grande Armée)|XI Corps]].

===The Peninsular War===
A new II Corps was created in 1808 in northern Spain from the troops under [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Jean-Baptiste Bessières]]. Soon after, Marshal [[Nicolas Soult]] took command of the formation. In 1810, [[Jean Reynier]] assumed command of the corps in Spain until 1811 when the unit was suppressed.

===The War Of The Fifth Coalition===
Meanwhile, a parallel II Corps was created in 1809 to fight against Austria. The formation was led first by [[Nicolas Oudinot]], then by Marshal [[Jean Lannes]] who was fatally wounded at [[Battle of Aspern-Essling|Aspern-Essling]]. Oudinot took over the corps again and won his marshal's baton at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]] in July 1809.

===The Invasion Of Russia===
Still commanded by [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Nicolas Oudinot]], the Corps took part in the [[French invasion of Russia (1812)|1812 invasion of Russia]], at which point its size was roughly 40,000 men.

The '''Institute of the Black World''' ('''IBW''') was a [[think tank]] based in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], which was founded and directed by [[African diaspora]] [[intellectual]]s from 1969 to 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Johnson |first=Christopher K. |editors= Molefi Kete Asante and Ama Mazama|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Black Studies |date= |year= 2005|publisher= |location= |id= |doi= 10.4135/9781412952538.n141|chapter=Institute of the Black World |title=Encyclopedia of Black Studies |isbn=9780761927624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Led primarily by [[Vincent Harding]], it was originally a project of the [[Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change]]&lt;ref&gt;Soyer, Daniel, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3444700638/institute-black-world.html "Institute of the Black World"], ''Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and is described by the historian Derrick E. White as "a collection of activist-intellectuals who analyzed the educational, political, and activist landscape to further the Black Freedom Struggle in the wake of King’s assassination."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University Press of Florida| isbn = 978-0-8130-4062-2| last = White| first = Derrick E| title =Challenge of Blackness: The Institute of the Black World and Political Activism in the 1970s| location = Gainesville| accessdate = 2016-09-21| date = 2011| url = http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=767222| page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Harding, [[Stephen Henderson (literary scholar)|Stephen Henderson]] and William Strickland (of the University of Massachusetts) formed the core leadership in the early years of the IBW.&lt;ref&gt;White 2011:9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacramentoblackbookfair.com/featured/bill_strickland.php Bill Strickland biography], Sacramento Black Book Fair.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IBW sought to build connections across a range of diverse Black approaches, including [[Black nationalism]], [[Racial integration|integrationism]], and [[Marxism]], and in particular sought to reach three specific audiences: First, Black scholars developing Black Studies programs; second, Black elected officials; and third, grassroots organizations.&lt;ref&gt;White 2011:6.&lt;/ref&gt; Its participants included nationalists [[John Henrik Clark]] and [[Julius Lester]], integrationists such as [[C. T. Vivian]], and a significant number of intellectuals from outside of the United States, particularly the Caribbean, including Marxist theorist [[C. L. R. James]], cultural theorist [[Sylvia Wynter]], historians [[Robert A. Hill (Jamaican historian)|Robert A. Hill]] and [[Walter Rodney]], and economists [[George Beckford]] and [[Norman Girvan]].&lt;ref&gt;White 2011:7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The IBW's own orientation has been described as "pragmatic Black nationalism... rooted in specific issues such as Black Studies or the creation of a black political agenda for the seventies; thus, its pragmatism critically engaged and employed the best practices from a variety of ideological perspectives, including cultural and political nationalism, as well as integration."&lt;ref&gt;White 2011:8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The organization closed in 1983.

{{Internet |expanded=Governance}}

The '''Internet Ungovernance Forum''' ('''IUF''') is an open forum for dialogue on issues of Internet censorship, freedom of speech, surveillance, privacy and community-centric governance approaches conceived by the [[Alternative Informatics Association]].&lt;ref name=IUF2014&gt;[https://iuf.alternatifbilisim.org/ "2014 Turkey - Internet Ungovernance Forum, official website"] Retrieved 30 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Forum was held in Turkey in September, 2014 and served as model for the organization of the Brazilian and Italian Forums of 2015.

==History and development of the IUF==

=== IUF Turkey 2014 ===
The first '''Internet Ungovernance Forum''' was held in September 2014 in Turkey to demand that fundamental freedoms, openness, unity and net neutrality remain as the building blocks of the Internet. It was held in parallel to the [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF), which was already taking place in Istanbul between 2–5 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/2014/09/07/internet-issues-discussed-in-internet-ungovernance-forum|title=Internet issues discussed in Internet Ungovernance Forum|last=|first=|date=2014-09-07|work=|newspaper=DailySabah|access-date=2017-02-02|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They felt that issues such as [[Net neutrality]], [[Internet privacy]] and Freedom of Speech were not getting the right attention at IGF.&lt;ref name="IUF2014"/&gt;

Participants of the two-day conference included [[Julian Assange]], [[Jacob Appelbaum]] and [[Amelia Andersdotter]].

The '''Irbit Bike Show''' (Ирбитский байк слёт) is held every year at the end of July. It is organised by the local bike club as a celebration of the town's importance as a manufacturer of heavy motorcycles (see [[IMZ-Ural]]) in both the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Russia]]. Thousands of riders from throughout the [[Sverdlovsk Oblast|Sverdlovsk region]] and other parts of Russia attend, and increasingly more foreign riders are attending.

'''Jailolo''' is a town and former sultanate on [[Halmahera]] in [[Indonesia]]'s [[Maluku Islands]]. It is located on the island's west coast approximately 20&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Ternate]]. Jailolo is a small port that serves Halmahera's northwestern coastal villages.

Before the arrival of Europeans was the most important political power on Halmahera. It is thought that the sultanate had a measure of influence and autonomy as a combined [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and Ternatean force overran in it 1551. It was then under the control of the Dutch and Ternateans for two centuries.

The Sultanate was re-established in 1798, by the Sultan of Tidore who had expelled the Dutch from his island and proclaimed a noble from [[Makian]] as Sultan of Jailolo. The Dutch forced the aristocracy into exile in 1832. Baba Hassan attempted a revolt in 1876, but his rebellion was easily put down by steam-powered Dutch warships. In 1914, a revolt over taxation saw Jailoloans kill the colonial district officer, and there was a revolt on the island of [[Waigeo]] off [[western New Guinea]]. The sultan's palace was located on a flat-topped hill above the junction of the Sahu-Sidangoli road, however, all remnants have now disappeared.

The local people are the Sahu. They perform traditional dances in August and September to celebrate the rice harvest. They recently converted to Christianity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1729">A philanthropic organisation set up in 1950 in [[Bulawayo]], Rhodesia (now called [[Zimbabwe]]) to support and train disadvantaged people. The founder, [[Jairos Jiri]], using Christian principles, wanted to help individuals who previously had been marginalized and rejected. Initially the association supported [[Art in Zimbabwe|arts endeavors]] and training and set up craft outlets selling tourist souvenirs, such as carvings, paintings, tiles and furniture. In the 1970s legal representation and affiliate support groups were founded in the UK. Jairos Jiri Associations now house the disadvantaged, support musical and dance groups, and are a powerful advocacy for those who would otherwise have no voice in Zimbabwe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3787">[[File:Ladegården, 1892.jpg|thumb|200px|Ladegården in 1892]]
'''Ladegården''', or '''Københavns Ladegård''' ("Copenahgen's Ladegård") was established as a farm under [[Copenhagen Castle]] by [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] in 1623 and was located roughly at the site of the present-day [[Radiohuset|Radio House]] on [[Rosenørns Allé]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. The complex with later additions later served a range of different functions before it was demolished in the early 1920.

==History==
[[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] built a farm referred to as Ladegården about which hardly anything is known at Nyby outside Copenhagen 1548. The building later associated with the name was established by [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] in 1623. The estate covered all of present-day [[Frederiksberg Municipality]]. Its purpose was to provide produce for the royal household, grazing for its livestock and feed for the royal mews. A building g with room for 500 pieces of cattle was destroyed in a storm in 1628 and a new, three-storey brick building was constructed in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kobenhavnshistorie.dk/bog/kko/l/kko_l-1.html|title=Ladegården|publisher=Selskabet for Københavns Historie|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex was surrounded by bastions and a moat that was fed with water from the Ladegård Canal as well as Rosenåen, a branch which emptied into the sea at [[Kalvebod Brygge|Kalvebod Beach]]. The farm was never an economic success and some of the land was sold off to a group of Dutch farmers from [[Amager]]. The building was destroyed during the [[Assault on Copenhagen (1659)|Swedish siege of Copenhagen]] in 1658-59.

The ruin was purchased by [[Christoffer Gabel]] in the earlu 1660s. In 1710, it was converted into a military hospital. During the outbreak of plague 1711-13, it was used as a plague hospital alongside nearby [[Vodroffsvej#Hospital|Vodroffgård]], housing one hundred patients at a time.

On 27 June 1723, the director of the Military Hospital Barracks applied for permission to establish a spinning mill and weaver at Ladegården. Shortly thereafter plans arose to transform the building into a [[workhouse]].

In 1768, Ladegården was sold to the City of Copenhagen. The residents of Sankt Hans Hospital, a mental institution based in another former plague hospital, which was located at Kalvebod Beach, was then transferred to the Ladegården site but the institution kept its name. The two facilities co-existed at Ladegården until 1816 when Sankt Hans Hospital was moved to Bistrup at [[Roskilde]].

Ladegården was once again left unused for until it was once again used as a workhouse from 1822. In 1834, it was expanded with a [[penal labour]] facility. In 1908, the indigent residents moved to the newly established institution Sundholm on [[Amager]]. The buildings were demolished in connection with extension of [[Rosenørns Allé]] in the 1920s. The [[Radiohuset|Radio House]] was built on the western part of the site. The gore between [[Åboulevard]], Rosenørns Allé and Julius Thomsens Gade was transferred from Frederiksberg to [[Copenhagen Municipality]] and redeveloped with housing.

Historically, the school served Gambian and non-Gambian students, with different tuition rates for non-Gambian students with parents working for international agencies, Gambian students, and other non-Gambian students.

A grant by the [[federal government of the United States]] was discontinued in 1984 when the [[Banjul American Embassy School]] (BAES) was established. American parents had paid high tuition dollars to Marina but got little power in the school's management. In addition, according to the BAES, at Marina "the level of English was questioned" and that Marina "was becoming less an international school".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://baes.gm/history History]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6Y5tSA0yE Archive]).

'''Merchant raiders''' are armed [[commerce raiding]] [[ship]]s that disguise themselves as [[non-combatant]] [[merchant vessel]]s.

==History==
[[Germany]] used several merchant raiders early in [[World War I]] (1914–1918), and again early in [[World War II]] (1939–1945). The most famous{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} captain of a German merchant raider, [[Felix von Luckner]], used the sailing ship [[SMS Seeadler (Windjammer)|SMS ''Seeadler'']] for his voyage (1916–1917). The Germans used a sailing ship at this stage of the war because coal-fired ships had limited access to fuel outside of territories held by the [[Central Powers]] due to international regulations concerning refueling of combat ships in neutral countries.

Germany sent out two waves of six surface raiders each during [[World War II]]. Most of these vessels were in the {{convert|8000|–|10000|LT|t}} range. Many of these vessels had originally been [[refrigerator ship]]s, used to transport fresh food from the tropics. These vessels were faster than regular [[merchant vessel]]s, which was important for a [[warship]]. They were armed with six [[15 cm SK L/45|15cm]] (5.9&amp;nbsp;inch) [[naval gun]]s, some smaller guns, [[torpedo]]es, [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance seaplanes]] and some were equipped for [[minelaying]]. Several captains demonstrated great creativity in disguising their vessels to masquerade as allied or as neutral merchants. ''[[German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|Kormoran]]'' sank the Australian cruiser [[HMAS Sydney (D48)|''Sydney'']] in one of the most well-known episodes involving merchant raiders during World War II.

Italy intended to outfit four refrigerated [[Banana boat (ship)|banana boat]]s as merchant raiders during World War II (''[[Ramb I]]'', ''[[Ramb II]]'', ''[[Ramb III]]'' and ''[[Ramb IV]]''). Only ''Ramb I'' and ''Ramb II'' served as merchant raiders and neither ship sank enemy vessels. The New Zealand cruiser [[HMNZS Leander|''Leander'']] [[Action of 27 February 1941|sank ''Ramb I'']] off the Maldives (February 1941); ''Ramb II'' sailed to the Far East, where the Japanese prevented her from raiding, ultimately took her over and converted her to an auxiliary transport ship. (''Ramb III'' served as a convoy escort and ''Ramb IV'' was converted for the Italian Royal Navy to a hospital ship.)

These commerce raiders carried no armour because their purpose was to attack merchantmen, not to engage warships. Also it would be difficult to fit armour to a civilian vessel. Eventually most were sunk or transferred to other duties.

The British deployed [[Armed Merchant Cruiser]]s in World War I and in World War II. Generally adapted from [[Ocean liner|passenger liner]]s, they were larger than the German merchant raiders.

During [[World War I]], the British [[Royal Navy]] deployed [[Q-ship]]s to combat German [[U-boat]]s. Q-ships were warships posing as merchant ships so as to lure U-boats to attack them; their mission of destroying enemy warships differed significantly from the raider objective of disrupting enemy trade.

'''Moonraisers''' are a [[reggae]] band formed in 1992 and based in [[Neuchâtel]], [[Switzerland]].  Their style, a type of electronic reggae dubbed ''World’n’Moonstyle Reggae'', joins roots reggae with [[funk]], [[world music|world]] and [[electronica|electro]] elements.They are best known for composing the original version of the dance super hit, ''Rise up''. Although at the time it came out it didn't make any success, the song became a hit played in the dance clubs for months after Yves laRocke made a dance cover of it.

The '''News Corporation takeover bid for BSkyB''' was a proposed takeover of [[British Sky Broadcasting]] (BSkyB) by [[News Corporation]], the media conglomerate of [[Rupert Murdoch]]. The bid was launched in June 2010, but was withdrawn in July 2011 following the [[News International phone hacking scandal]]. News Corporation already owned 39.1% of BSkyB, and held on to its stake following the collapse of the takeover bid. The takeover was an essential part of News Corporation's business strategy, not least as it would have made possible integration with other entities such as [[Sky Deutschland]] and [[Sky Italia]].&lt;ref name=Pratley&gt;Nils Pratley, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 12 July 2011, [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/11/viewpoint-news-corp-bskyb-takeover News Corp needs all of BSkyB]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' went so far as to say that, "Without a full takeover of BSkyB, News Corp's global satellite strategy would look an unco-ordinated mess."&lt;ref name=Pratley/&gt;

The first key turning point in the planned takeover was the removal in December 2010 of regulatory approval from [[Vince Cable]], who had told undercover reporters from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' he had "declared war" on Murdoch. When these comments were made public, the final say on the deal went instead to [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]]. Cable's comments on this matter were not published by the ''Telegraph'', but were instead leaked to BBC journalist [[Robert Peston]], most likely (according to a later Telegraph investigation) by two former Telegraph employees who had moved to [[News International]], a News Corporation subsidiary. Hunt was much more sympathetic to the takeover bid than Cable.

The second turning point was the series of revelations in early July of the hacking of the phones of non-celebrity victims by the ''[[News of the World]]'', a tabloid newspaper published by News International. Details of the activities, especially regarding the paper's hacking into the voicemail of murder victim [[Milly Dowler]], sparked widespread outrage against News Corporation. Attempts to defuse the scandal by closing the ''News of the World'' and publishing an apology by Murdoch both failed. In the face of a planned motion in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] calling on News Corporation to abandon the bid, News Corporation acquiesced.

==Offer==
On 15 June 2010, BSkyB announced that it had rejected an offer from [[News Corporation]] to take full control of the company. News Corp had offered 700p per share for the remaining 60.9% of shares that it did not own. BSkyB said that it would only consider offers of at least 800p per share.&lt;ref name="offereject"&gt;{{Cite news

==Regulatory issues==
Although the two companies had not agreed on a revised takeover proposal, News Corporation announced its intention to seek regulatory approval from the European Commission in November.&lt;ref name="seekapproval"&gt;{{Cite news

  | accessdate = 3 March 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal was also reviewed by the British government. On 4 November 2010 [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Business Secretary]] [[Vince Cable]] referred the takeover bid to [[Ofcom]] to consider issues of media plurality.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/8634176/News-of-the-World-phone-hacking-scandal-timeline.html |title=News of the World phone hacking scandal: timeline |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=13 July 2011|accessdate=14 July 2011 |location=London |first1=Indu |last1=Chandrasekhar |first2=Murray |last2=Wardrop |first3=Andy |last3=Trotman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011 it was reported that around this time News Corp's [[News International]] subsidiary had "bullied" the Liberal Democrats. ''[[The Observer]]'' said that "According to one account from a senior party figure, a cabinet minister was told that, if the government did not do as NI wanted, the Lib Dems would be 'done over' by the Murdoch papers."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 24 July 2011, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/23/news-international-liberal-democrats-bskyb News International 'bullied Liberal Democrats over BSkyB bid']&lt;/ref&gt;

In late December 2010, undercover reporters from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', posing as constituents, set up a meeting with Cable, in which he made some unguarded remarks about the coalition, including a description of the coalition's attempt at fast, widespread reforms (including the health service and local governments) as being a "kind of Maoist revolution". When his comments appeared in the press on 21 December, Cable stated, "Naturally I am embarrassed by these comments and I regret them", before reaffirming his commitment to the coalition government, stating that "I am proud of what it is achieving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/8215462/Vince-Cable-I-could-bring-down-the-Government.html |title=Vince Cable: I could bring down the Government |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= 20 December 2010|accessdate=21 December 2010 |location=London |first=Holly |last=Watt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Norman Smith |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12045792 |title=Vince Cable said he could quit coalition if pushed |publisher=BBC |date= 21 December 2010|accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 the [[Press Complaints Commission]] upheld a complaint regarding the ''Telegraph'''s use of subterfuge: "On this occasion, the commission was not convinced that the public interest was such as to justify proportionately this level of subterfuge."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 10 May 2011, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/10/daily-telegraph-vince-cable-tapes Daily Telegraph censured by PCC over Vince Cable tapes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an undisclosed part of the ''Telegraph'' transcript, Cable stated in reference to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s News Corporation takeover bid for BSkyB, "I have declared war on Mr Murdoch and I think we are going to win." This was given to the [[BBC]]'s [[Robert Peston]] by a whistleblower unhappy that the ''Telegraph'' had not published Cable's comments in full, and also published on 21 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12053656 |title=Vince Cable criticises Murdoch takeover in secret tapes |publisher=BBC |date= 21 December 2010|accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this revelation Cable had his responsibility for media affairs – including ruling on Murdoch's takeover plans – withdrawn from his role as business secretary that same day.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Wintour, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/dec/21/vince-cable-war-murdoch-gaffe "Humiliated Vince Cable stripped of Sky role after 'war with Murdoch' gaffe"], ''The Guardian'', 21 December 2010. Retrieved 23 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011 a firm of private investigators hired by the ''Telegraph'' to track the source of the leak concluded "strong suspicion" that two former Telegraph employees who had moved to [[News International]], one of them [[William Lewis (journalist)|Will Lewis]], had gained access to the transcript and audio files and leaked them to Peston.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 23 July 2011, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/22/willlewis-telegraphmediagroup News Corp boss 'linked' to leak of Vince Cable's Rupert Murdoch comments]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the business secretary Vince Cable was stripped of his jurisdiction over the deal, the proposal was referred to [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]], the [[Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport|Secretary of State for culture, media and sport]].&lt;ref name="tohunt"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt initially elected not to refer to the deal to the [[Competition Commission]], announcing on 3 March 2011 that he intended to accept a series of undertakings given by News Corporation, paving the way for the deal to be approved. The undertakings would have led to [[Sky News]] being severed from BSkyB.&lt;ref name="skyspinoff"&gt;{{Cite news

  | accessdate = 3 March 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 June it was reported that News Corp had reached an agreement with [[Ofcom]] to approve the takeover, on the basis of [[Sky News]] becoming a separate company.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Independent]]'', 23 June 2011, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/hunt-set-to-give-goahead-to-bskyb-deal-next-week-2301420.html Hunt set to give go-ahead to BSkyB deal next week]&lt;/ref&gt;

By early July, despite public opposition to the deal, "Government says its ready to give clearance to deal. Jeremy Hunt gives opponents one final week to raise objections. However, he has provisionally agreed to proposals that will see Sky News be spun off as an independent company to allay fears the deal would give Mr Murdoch's News Corporation too much control of the media. After the consultation ends on July 8, Mr Hunt is expected to wave the merger through once and for all. He is keen to give final confirmation by July 19 when the summer parliamentary recess begins."&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; Several days later, with the [[News of the World phone hacking scandal]] exploding, [[Ofcom]] intervened, saying that it has "a duty to be satisfied on an ongoing basis that the holder of a broadcasting licence is 'fit and proper'".&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt;

==Bid withdrawn==
It was in the wake of the [[Milly Dowler]] phone hacking allegations that a significant number of people, including former deputy prime minister [[John Prescott]] and other politicians, began to seriously question whether the takeover of BSkyB by News Corporation ought to be blocked.&lt;ref name="prescottcomment"&gt;{{Cite news

Soon after launch, the campaign gained the support of suspected hacking victim, the actor [[Hugh Grant]], who became a public spokesperson, appearing on ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' and ''[[Newsnight]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediastandardstrust.org/mst-news/hacked-off-campaign-for-a-public-inquiry-into-phone-hacking/|title=Media Standards Trust  " Blog Archive   " Hacked Off: Campaign for a Public Inquiry into Phone Hacking|publisher=mediastandardstrust.org|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, during the [[News International phone hacking scandal]], BSkyB shares plummeted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barr |first=Robert |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/07/08/2304932/bskyb-shares-down-again-as-pm.html |title=BSkyB shares plunge on News Corp bid doubts – National Business |work=The Miami Herald |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hunt received well over 150,000 submissions from members of the public, driven by efforts by campaign groups [[Avaaz.org]] and [[38 Degrees]]. Most submissions were opposed to News Corp taking full control of BSkyB. News Corp subsequently withdrew undertakings made as part of negotiations with the government, triggering an immediate referral of the proposal to the Competition Commission.&lt;ref name="referralcomp"&gt;{{Cite news

Numerous analysts and commentators suggested that as a result of the phone hacking scandal, it would be politically difficult or impossible for News Corp to proceed with its takeover plans.&lt;ref name="sentiment1"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to public pressure for the deal to be withdrawn or for the Government to halt the proposal, Britain's major political parties all expressed the view that the deal should not go ahead. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] both indicated that they would support an [[opposition day]] motion from [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] calling on News Corp to rescind its offer.&lt;ref name="parliamentmotion"&gt;{{Cite news

On 13 July, shortly before the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] was due to debate the motion, News Corporation announced that it would be withdrawing its proposal to take complete ownership of BSkyB.&lt;ref name="BBC-withdraw"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14142307|title=News Corp withdraws bid for BSkyB|publisher=BBC|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chase Carey, the corporation's deputy chairman, stated that it was "too difficult to progress" with the proposed takeover given the phone hacking controversy.&lt;ref name="bskybpullout"&gt;{{Cite news

The '''People's Revolutionary Party of Benin''' ({{lang-fr|Parti de la Révolution Populaire du Bénin}}) was a [[political party]] in the [[People's Republic of Benin]]. It was founded in 1975 by General [[Mathieu Kérékou]]. With the new constitution of November 30, 1975, PRPB became the [[One-party state|sole legal party]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrique-express.com/archive/OUEST/benin/beninpaysfiche/chronopol.htm Chronologie BENIN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109230740/http://www.afrique-express.com/archive/OUEST/benin/beninpaysfiche/chronopol.htm |date=2007-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideologically, the party was committed to [[Marxism-Leninism]].

In the parliamentary elections of [[Beninese parliamentary election, 1979|1979]], [[Beninese parliamentary election, 1984|1984]] and [[Beninese parliamentary election, 1989|1989]], PRPB was the only party contesting. In 1979, the lists of the party received 1,243,286 votes (97.9%), in 1984 the lists of the party received 1,811,208 votes (98.1%) and in 1989 the lists of the party received 1,695,860 votes (89.6%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/BENIN_1984_E.PDF], [http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/BENIN_1979_E.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the party renounced Marxism-Leninism as its ideological guidance. It remained the governing force of Benin until 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/french/specials/1618_benin_elex/page8.shtml BBCAfrique.com | Présidentielle 2006 au Bénin]&lt;/ref&gt; The party was dissolved in 1990 and succeeded by the [[Union of Forces of Progress (Benin)|Union of Forces of Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;David Lea &amp; Annamarie Rowe (2001) ''A Political Chronology of Africa'', Taylor &amp; Francis, p34&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pretzel''' ({{audio|GT Pretzel.ogg|listen}}) ({{lang-de|Breze(l)}}) ({{audio|GT Brezel.ogg|listen}}) is a type of [[baking|baked]] [[bread]] product made from [[dough]] most commonly shaped into a twisted [[knot]]. Pretzels originated in Europe, possibly among monastery monks in the [[Early Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=silverman&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=Sharon Hernes|title=Pennsylvania Snacks|publisher=Stackpole Books|year=2001|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q0KyXgBhuZMC&amp;pg=PA30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional pretzel shape is a distinctive nonsymmetrical form, with the ends of a long strip of dough intertwined and then twisted back into itself in a certain way (a pretzel loop). In modern times, pretzels come in a range of different shapes. [[Salt]] is the most common seasoning for pretzels, complementing the [[sodium carbonate|washing soda]] or [[sodium hydroxide|lye]] [[lye roll|treatment]] that gives pretzels their traditional skin and flavor through the [[Maillard reaction]]; other seasonings include various [[cheese]]s, [[sugar]]s, [[chocolate]], [[glaze (cooking technique)|glaze]]s, [[seed]]s, or [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s. There are several varieties of pretzels, including soft pretzels, which must be eaten shortly after preparation, and hard-baked pretzels, which have a long shelf life. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Jeffrey|title=How the pretzel went from soft to hard – and other little-known facts about one of the world’s favorite snacks|url=https://theconversation.com/how-the-pretzel-went-from-soft-to-hard-and-other-little-known-facts-about-one-of-the-worlds-favorite-snacks-95409|accessdate=26 April 2018|work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous unreliable accounts regarding the origin of pretzels, as well as the origin of the name; most assume that they have Christian backgrounds and were invented by European monks.&lt;ref name="silverman"/&gt; According to legend, as cited by several sources, including ''The History of Science and Technology'', by Bryan Bunch and Alexander Hellemans,{{Unreliable source?|reason=Extraordinarily specific claim, for which source provides no evidence.|date=August 2015}} in 610 AD &lt;!-- This is a direct quotation --&gt;"... [a]n Italian monk invents pretzels as a reward to children who learn their prayers. He calls the strips of baked dough, folded to resemble arms crossing the chest, 'pretiola' ("little reward[s]")"&lt;!-- This is a direct quotation --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-did-the-pretzel-get-its-shape/|title=how-did-the-pretzel-get-its-shape/|publisher=wonderopolis.org|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kitchenproject.com/history/Pretzel.htm|title=history/Pretzel|publisher=www.kitchenproject.com|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/tour/pretzel-museum.htm|title=pretzel-museum|publisher=www.ushistory.org|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/hungry-history/the-pretzel-a-twisted-history|title=hungry-history, twisted history|publisher=www.history.com|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no known historical evidence to verify this claim. Another source locates the invention in a monastery in southern France.&lt;ref name="silverman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hartel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hartel|first=AnnaKate|title=Food Bites|publisher=Springer|year=2008|page=111|isbn=0-387-75844-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PMOrW3zkirwC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=history+of+pretzels&amp;lr=&amp;ei=AUExSpzcG4aCywTz2PiKDg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grunes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grunes|first=Barbara|title=The Best Bake Sale Ever Cookbook|publisher=Chronicle Books|year=2007|page=80|isbn=0-8118-5075-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=juPycXQouOgC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=history+of+pretzels&amp;lr=&amp;ei=AUExSpzcG4aCywTz2PiKDg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The looped pretzel may also be related to a Greek ring bread, derived from communion bread used in monasteries a thousand years ago.&lt;ref name="german"&gt;http://www.bad-bad.de/restaur/kuechenkunde/brezel.htm (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, there are stories that pretzels were the invention of desperate [[baker]]s held hostage by local dignitaries.&lt;ref name="brezelbaecker"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Gruenert |url=http://www.brezel-baecker.de/brezelgeschichte#kapitel1 |title=Brezelgeschichte, Brezelhistorie, Brezel, Geschichte, Historie |publisher=Brezel-baecker.de |date=2009-08-23 |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]]'' from 1905 suspects the origin of pretzels in a ban of heathen baking traditions, such as in the form of a [[sun cross]], at the Synod of Estinnes in the year 743. The pretzel may have emerged as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Meyers-1905/A/Brezel Brezel in Meyers Konversationslexikon von 1905 bei Zeno.org] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Jacob Fobsen Van Es Déjeuner Nancy 250808.jpg|thumb|right|288px|''Fish lunch'' by [[Jacob Foppens van Es]], before 1640, [[Museum of Fine Arts of Nancy]]]]
The German name "''Brezel''" may derive also from [[Latin]] ''bracellus'' (a medieval term for "bracelet"),&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]'' s.v.: "[G. ''pretzel'', ''bretzel'', in OHG. ''brizzila'' = It. ''bracciello'' Florio) a cracknel; usually taken as ad. med. L. ''bracellus'' a bracelet; also a kind of cake or biscuit (Du Cange)]"&lt;/ref&gt; or ''bracchiola'' ("little arms").

The pretzel has been in use as an emblem of bakers and formerly their [[guild]]s in southern German areas since at least the 12th century.&lt;ref name=brezelbaecker/&gt; A 12th-century illustration in the ''[[Hortus deliciarum]]'' from the southwest German [[Alsace]] region (today France) may contain the earliest depiction of a pretzel. Within the [[Christian Church]], pretzels were regarded as having religious significance for both ingredients and shape. The knot shape has been claimed to represent hands in [[prayer]].&lt;ref name="silverman"/&gt; Moreover, the three holes within the pretzel represent the three persons of the [[Holy Trinity]]: [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and [[God the Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name="Silverman2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=Sharon Hernes|title=Pennsylvania Snacks|date=20 November 2000|publisher=Stackpole Books|language=English |isbn=9780811728744|page=30|quote=It was in the year 610 A.D., at a monastery in Southern France or Northern Italy, that a creative monk first formed strips of bread dough into the shape of a child's arms folded in prayer. The three holes represented the Christian Trinity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pretzels made with a simple recipe using only flour and water could be eaten during Lent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SAUNDERS|first=Fr.

As time passed, pretzels became associated with both Lent and Easter. Pretzels were hidden on Easter morning just as eggs are hidden today, and are particularly associated with [[Lent]], fasting, and prayers before [[Easter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=543 Catholicculture.org]&lt;!--  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095810/http://www.catholicculture.org/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=543 |date=2007-09-29 }} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the holes in the hubs of round Swedish flat bread (which let them be hung on strings), the loops in pretzels may have served a practical purpose: bakers could hang them on sticks, for instance, projecting upwards from a central column, as shown in a painting by Job Berckheyde (1630–93) from around 1681.&lt;ref&gt;Job Berckheyde, (1630-93), ''The Baker'', c.1681 (oil on canvas) http://www.worcesterart.org/Collection/European/1975.105.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Pretzel baking has most firmly taken root in the region of [[Franconia]] (modern [[Germany|German]] states of [[Bavaria]] and [[Baden-Württemberg]]) and adjoining [[Upper German]]-speaking areas, and pretzels have been an integral part of German baking traditions for centuries. Lye pretzels are popular in southern Germany, [[Alsace]], Austria, and German-speaking Switzerland as a variety of bread, a side dish or a snack, and come in many local varieties. Almost every region and even city has its own way of baking them. Examples for pretzel names in various Upper-German dialects are ''Breze'', ''Brezn'', ''Bretzel'', ''Brezzl'', ''Brezgen'', ''Bretzga'', ''Bretzet'', ''Bretschl'', ''Kringel'', ''Silserli,'' and ''Sülzerli''.&lt;ref name="brezel-baecker.de"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Gruenert |url=http://www.brezel-baecker.de/brezelgeschichte#kapitel16 |title=Brezelgeschichte, Brezelhistorie, Brezel, Geschichte, Historie |publisher=Brezel-baecker.de |date=2009-08-23 |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baked for consumption on the same day, they are sold in every bakery and in special booths or stands in downtown streets. Often, they are sliced horizontally, buttered, and sold as ''Butterbrezel'', or come with slices of cold meats or cheese. [[Sesame]], [[poppy seed|poppy]], [[sunflower]], [[Pepita|pumpkin]], or [[caraway seed]]s, melted [[cheese]], and bacon bits are other popular toppings. Some bakeries offer pretzels made of different flours, such as [[whole wheat]], [[rye]] or [[spelt]]. 

In Bavaria, lye pretzels accompany a main dish, such as [[Weisswurst]] sausage. The same dough and baking procedure with lye and salt is used to make other kinds of "lye pastry" (''Laugengebäck''): [[lye roll]]s, buns, croissants, and even loaves (''Laugenbrötchen'', ''Laugenstangen'', ''Laugen[[croissant]]s'', ''Laugenbrot'').&lt;ref name="brezelbaecker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brezel-baecker.de"/&gt; Yet, in some parts of [[Bavaria]], especially in lower Bavaria, unglazed "white" pretzels, sprinkled with salt and caraway seeds are still popular. Basically, with the same ingredients, lye pretzels come in numerous local varieties. Sizes are usually similar; the main differences are the thickness of the dough, the content of fat and the degree of baking. Typical [[Swabia]]n pretzels, for example, have very thin "arms" and a "fat belly" with a split, and a higher fat content. The thicker part makes it easier to slice them for the use of sandwiches. In Bavarian pretzels, the arms are left thicker so they do not bake to a crisp and contain very little fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meistermarken-ulmerspatz.de/downloads/bbz/Herstellung_Laugengebaeck.pdf |title=230835/Herst.Laugengeb_Inhalt |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pretzel shape is used for a variety of sweet pastries made of different types of dough (flaky, brittle, soft, crispy) with a variety of toppings (icing, nuts, seeds, cinnamon). Around Christmas, they can be made of soft gingerbread ("[[Lebkuchen]]") with chocolate coating. In southern Germany and adjoining German-speaking areas, pretzels have retained their original religious meanings and are still used in various traditions and festivals. In some areas, on January 1, people give each other lightly sweetened yeast pretzels for good luck and good fortune. These "New Year's pretzels" are made in different sizes and can have a width of {{convert|50|cm}} and more. Sometimes children visit their godparents to fetch their New Years pretzel. On May 1, love-struck boys used to paint a pretzel on the doors of the adored. On the other hand, an upside-down pretzel would have been a sign of disgrace. Especially Catholic areas, such as Austria, Bavaria, or some parts of Swabia, the "Palm pretzel" is made for [[Palm Sunday]] celebrations. Sizes can range from {{Convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} up to {{Convert|1|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and they can weigh up to {{Convert|2.5|kg||abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brezel-weber.de/html/palmbrezel.html |title=Palmbrezel |publisher=Brezel-weber.de |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Gruenert |url=http://www.brezel-baecker.de/brezelgeschichte |title=Brezelgeschichte, Brezelhistorie, Brezel, Geschichte, Historie |publisher=Brezel-baecker.de |date=2009-08-23 |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; An old tradition on Palm Sunday dating back to 1533 is the outdoor pretzel market (''Brezgenmarkt'') in the Hungerbrunnen Valley near [[Heldenfingen]].

In the [[Rhineland]] region, sweet pretzels are made with pudding-filled loops (pudding pretzels). On [[Laetare Sunday]] in [[Luxembourg]], the fourth Sunday in [[Lent]], there is a festival called "Pretzel Sunday". Boys give their girlfriends pretzels or cakes in pretzel form.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrichs, Ann. ''Luxembourg''. New York: Scholastic, Inc, 2005, p. 105. {{ISBN|978-0-516-23681-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size symbolizes how much he likes her. In return, if a girl wants to increase his attention, she will give him a decorated egg on Easter. The pretzel custom is reversed on Pretzel Sunday during [[leap year]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Spicer, Dorothy Gladys. ''Festivals of Western Europe''. New York: H.W. Wilson Co., 1958, pp. 106-7. {{ISBN|978-1-4375-2015-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This custom also still exists in some areas of the [[Swabian Alb]].&lt;ref name=german13&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Gruenert |url=http://www.brezel-baecker.de/brezelgeschichte#kapitel13 |title=Brezelgeschichte, Brezelhistorie, Brezel, Geschichte, Historie |publisher=Brezel-baecker.de |date=2009-08-23 |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same occasion in [[Rhenish Hesse]] and [[Palatinate (region)|the Palatinate]], people have parades carrying big pretzels mounted on colourful decorated poles.&lt;ref name=german13/&gt;

During Lent in [[Biberach an der Riss|Biberach]], "Lent pretzels" are popular. These are shortly boiled in water before baking and afterwards sprinkled with salt. [[Schloss Burg (Solingen)|Schloss Burg]] is renowned for a 200-year-old speciality, the "Burger pretzel". Its texture and flavour resembles [[rusk]] or [[zwieback]]. A local story says that the recipe came from a grateful Napoleonic soldier in 1795, whose wounds were treated by a baker's family in the little town of [[Solingen|Burg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klingenpfad.de/Brezel.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050523034724/http://www.klingenpfad.de/Brezel.htm|date=May 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural importance of the pretzel for Burg is expressed by a monument in honour of the pretzel bakers, and by an 18 km hiking trail nearby called "Pretzel Hiking Trail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=gekapanne |url=http://www.gps-tour.info/de/touren/detail.31536.html |title=Wandern: Der Brezel-Wanderweg um Schloß Burg (Tour 31536) - Tourenblatt |publisher=Gps-tour.info |date=2008-07-30 |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety typical for Upper [[Franconia]] is the "anise pretzel". The town of [[Weidenberg]] celebrates the "Pretzel weeks" during the [[carnival]] season when [[anise]] flavored pretzels are served with special dishes such as cooked meat with [[horseradish]] or roast.
In the city of [[Lübeck]], the 500-year-old [[guild]] of boatmen on the [[Stecknitz Canal]] call their annual meetings in January ''Kringelhöge'' (Pretzelfun). The elaborate affair, with about 200 participants, is celebrated as a breakfast with beer and includes Mass in the Lübeck Cathedral and a presentation of songs by a children's choir. In earlier times, the children were very poor, coming from an orphanage, and each received a ''Kringel'' (pretzel) as a reward. Hence, the name "Pretzelfun" was adopted, because this gift was considered a highlight. Today, the children come from schools, but they still get the pretzels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rondeshagen.com/Kringelhoege2008.html |title=Kringelhöge 2008 |publisher=Rondeshagen.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Osnabrück]] celebrates the anniversary of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) and organizes an annual [[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby horse]] race for grade-four children. On finishing the race, they are presented with a sweet pretzel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osnabrueck.de/13076.asp |title=Büro für Friedenskultur &amp;#124; Steckenpferdreiten |publisher=Osnabrueck.de |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[heraldry]], the city seal of [[Nörten-Hardenberg|Nörten]] dates from around 1550 and depicts two facing lions holding a pretzel at the center.&lt;ref name="ref-1794860229"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=N%C3%B6rten-Hardenberg|title=Nörten-Hardenberg - Heraldry of the World, Wappen, Gemeindewappen|publisher=ngw.nl|accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lye pretzel is the theme for a number of festivals in Germany. The city of [[Speyer]] prides itself to be the "pretzel town", and around the second weekend of July, from Friday to Tuesday, it holds an annual [[funfair]] and festival called "''[[Speyer Brezelfest|Brezelfest]]''", which is the largest [[beer festival]] in the [[Upper Rhine]] region, and attracts around 300,000 visitors. The festival includes a parade with over 100 bands, floats, and clubs participating from the whole region, and 22,000 pretzels are thrown among the crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://verkehrsverein-speyer.de/content/view/31/43/ |title=Geschichte |publisher=Verkehrsverein-Speyer |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315110653/http://verkehrsverein-speyer.de/content/view/31/43/ |archivedate=2010-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the market square of Speyer, there is a fountain with a statue of a boy selling pretzels.

In the late 18th century, southern German and Swiss German immigrants introduced the pretzel to North America. The immigrants became known as the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]], and in time, many handmade pretzel bakeries populated the central Pennsylvania countryside, and the pretzel's popularity spread.&lt;ref name="KP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kitchenproject.com/history/Pretzel.htm |title=The History of the Pretzel |publisher=Kitchenproject.com |date=2008-07-21 |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to that, street vendors used to sell pretzels on street corners in wooden glass-enclosed cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phillyhistory.org/PhotoArchive/Search.aspx?minx=2636294.21875&amp;maxx=2750294.21875&amp;miny=169693.125&amp;maxy=302693.125&amp;updateDays=0&amp;type=area&amp;keywords=pretzel&amp;withoutLoc=true&amp;sortOrderM=Distance&amp;start=0&amp;limit=24&amp;mstart=0&amp;mlimit=12 |title=Historical Photo Archives of Philadelphia Pretzel Vendors |publisher=Phillyhistory.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[File:Dinkelbrezelchen.jpg|thumb|Hard Pretzels]] --&gt;
{{anchor|sticks}}Hard pretzels originated in the United States, where, in 1850, the [[Sturgis Pretzel House|Sturgis bakery]] in [[Lititz, Pennsylvania]], became the first commercial hard pretzel bakery. [[Snack food]] hard pretzels are made in the form of loops, braids, letters, little pretzels, or sticks around {{convert|3|mm|in|frac=8}} thick and {{convert|12|cm|in|0}} long; they have become a popular snack in many countries around the world. A thicker variety of sticks can be {{convert|1.5|cm|in|frac=2}} thick; in the U. S. these are called [[Bavaria]]n pretzels or pretzel rods. Unlike the soft pretzels, these were durable when kept in an airtight environment and marketable in a variety of convenience stores. Large-scale production began in the first half of the 1900s, more so during 1930 to 1950. A prime example was in 1949, when highly innovative [[American Machine and Foundry]] Co., of New York City, developed the "pretzel bender": a new automatic crispy-styled baked pretzel-twisting machine that rolled and tied them at the rate of 50 a minute—more than twice as fast as skilled hand twisters could make them—and conveyed them through the baking and salting process.&lt;ref name="ref438875569"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.modernmechanix.com/machine-speeds-pretzel-bending/|title=Machine Speeds Pretzel Bending &amp;#124; Modern Mechanix|publisher=blog.modernmechanix.com|accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Europe, snack-food pretzels are usually sprinkled with salt, but also with sesame seed, poppy seed, or cheese. In the U.S., they come in many varieties of flavors and coatings, such as [[yogurt]], chocolate, strawberry, mustard, cheese and others, and chocolate-covered hard pretzels are popular around Christmas time and given as gifts. The variety of shapes and sizes became contest of imagination in the marketing of the pretzels taste. During the 1900s, people in Philadelphia would use the small slender pretzel stick as a common accompaniment to [[ice cream]] or would crumble pretzels as a topping. This combination of cold sweet and salty taste was very popular for many years. Eventually, this led to the development of an ice cream cone tasting like a pretzel. More recently [[Mars, Incorporated]] manufactures [[M&amp;M's]] with a small spherical pretzel covered in [[milk chocolate]] and [[candy]] coated in all of the standard M&amp;M's colors, called "Pretzel M&amp;M's". Soft pretzels are frequently sold in [[shopping mall]]s, with notable chains including [[Auntie Anne's]] and [[Pretzelmaker]]/Pretzel Time.

[[Freeport, Illinois]], which sits about 100 miles outside of Chicago, is another city known for its rich pretzel history.{{cn|date=May 2017}} In 1869, a German immigrant named John Billerbeck&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=alicehorner&amp;id=I43869|title=RootsWeb's WorldConnect Project: The Horner Family Of Carroll County, Illinois (And Nearly Everyone Else)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; established the first Billerbeck Bakery which was known for selling German style pretzels to compliment the large number of breweries that existed in Freeport during this time. [[Prohibition]] eventually shut down the breweries which led to the decline of pretzel sales in Freeport, but the city never lost its pretzel pride. For more than 100 years, Freeport has been known as "Pretzel City, USA." Their high school athletic mascot is the Pretzel and the football stadium has been appropriately named "Pretzel Field." In 2003, local citizens launched Freeport's first Pretzel Festival which is a large community event where residents get together to celebrate the city's pretzel history. Contestants are chosen to be crowned Pretzel Prince and Princess and a festival mascot by the name of "Pretzel Bill" (stemming from the Billerbeck Bakery name) dresses as a 6-foot tall walking talking pretzel who hands out pretzels from floats and takes photos with the local festival goers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-06-29/features/0706280746_1_local-ceiling-tasty/2|title=Let's twist again|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other countries ===
Although not as popular as among German speakers and Americans, the looped pretzel is known in other European countries and in other countries around the world. In the Czech Republic, the pretzel is known as ''preclík'', in Finland as ''viipurinrinkeli'', in Slovakia, it is called ''praclík''. The Spanish, French call it ''bretzel'', the Italian ''brezel'', the Dutch favor sweet variants called ''krakeling'', Norwegian and Danish call it a ''[[kringle]]'', and the [[Swedish cuisine|Swedish]] call it ''kringla''. In Polish it is ''precel'', in Hungarian and Croatian it is ''perec'', and in Serbian it is ''pereca''.&lt;ref name="brezel-baecker.de"/&gt; In Romania, the pretzel is known as a variety of ''[[covrigi]]'' and it is a very popular fast food in urban areas and also as a holiday gift.

'''SIPTU''' (Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union; {{lang-ga|An Ceardchumann Seirbhísí, Tionsclaíoch, Gairmiúil agus Teicniúil}}) is [[Ireland]]'s largest trade union, with around 200,000 members. Most of these members are in the [[Republic of Ireland]], although the union does have a [[Northern Ireland]] branch. Its head office, [[Liberty Hall]], is in [[Dublin]], and regional headquarters are located in [[Kilkenny]], [[Galway]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Monaghan]]. SIPTU is affiliated to the [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions]] and to the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Irish Labour Party]].

The Union has its roots in two separate trade unions both founded by the trade union leader and socialist activist [[James Larkin]]; the [[Irish Transport and General Workers' Union]] and the [[Workers' Union of Ireland|Federated Workers' Union of Ireland]]. The two unions merged in 1990 to create SIPTU. The merger was first proposed in the 1950s, and almost happened in 1969.

SIPTU is a [[general union]] which organises across the public and private sectors in Ireland and has large numbers of members working in construction, health, education, transport and manufacturing. It has a long-term commitment to delivering social solidarity and has developed a leadership role in the areas of rights for unemployed persons, people with disabilities and older persons. The union, as part of  promoting fairness at work and justice in society, includes migrant workers in Ireland and campaigns on the twin issues of the exploitation of migrant workers, particularly those from [[Poland]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], and the consequent displacement of Irish workers from employment.

The union established an Organising Unit in 2004 and its president, [[Jack O'Connor (trade unionist)|Jack O'Connor]], set as his objective the transformation of SIPTU - hitherto firmly committed to a servicing agenda - into an organising union.&lt;ref name="marsh"&gt;Arthur Marsh and John B. Smethurst, ''Historical Directory of Trade Unions'', vol.5, pp.440-441&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Southeast European Cooperation Process Map.svg|right|thumb|280px|South-East European Cooperation Process member states]]

The '''South-East European Cooperation Process''' ('''SEECP''') was launched on [[Bulgaria]]'s initiative in 1996. At the Bulgaria-chaired meeting in [[Sofia]], the [[Southeast Europe]] (SEE) countries laid the foundations for regional co-operation for the purposes of creating an atmosphere of trust, good neighbourly relations and stability.

A special characteristic of SEECP is that it is an original form of co-operation among the countries in the region launched on their own initiative, and not on the initiative of some other [[international organisation]] or countries. In that regard, the SEECP seeks to define itself as an authentic voice of SEE, complementary to the [[Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe|Stability Pact]], [[Southeast European Cooperative Initiative]] or the [[Stabilisation and Association Process]].

The basic goals of regional co-operation within SEECP include the strengthening of security and the political situation, intensification of economic relations and co-operation in the areas of human resources, democracy, justice, and battle against illegal activities. It is the intention of the SEECP to enable its members to approach the [[European Union|European]] and [[NATO|Euro-Atlantic]] structures through the strengthening of good neighbourly relations and transformation of the region into an area of peace and stability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2203">The '''Timočani''' (also '''Timochani''', or '''Timochans''') ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: Тимочани) were a medieval [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] tribe that lived in the territory of present-day eastern [[Serbia]], west of the [[Timok River]], as well as in the regions of [[Banat]], [[Syrmia]] and [[Moesia Superior]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Timočani settled in the Balkans in the 6th century and became later subjects of the [[Avar Khaganate]]. In 805 that area was conquered of the [[Bulgar Khanate]] under Khan [[Krum of Bulgaria|Krum]]. In 818 during the rule of [[Omurtag of Bulgaria]] (814-836) they, together with other border tribes of the First Bulgarian Empire, revolted because of an administrative reform that deprived them of much of their local authority.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=pi0xAAAAIAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

They, together with other Slavic tribes, searched protection from [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Louis the Pious]] in the same year, meeting him at his court at [[Herstal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historyexam.hit.bg/2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724014801/http://historyexam.hit.bg/2.htm |archivedate=2010-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Omurtag decided to settle the matter by means of diplomacy in 824-826, though his letters were not replied to by Louis. This prompted Omurtag to undertake a boat campaign on the [[Drava]] in 827 and invade the lands of the Timočani at [[Sirmium]], successfully imposing Bulgar rule again and appointing local governors. Many Timochans fled to Transdanubia, later becoming part of the [[Balaton Principality]].

Today, ''Timočani'' can be used as an informal name for the inhabitants of the [[Timok (river)|Timok]] region in Serbia and Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=Stc&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=gXMtAQAAIAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Christus Sol Invictus.jpeg|thumb|Detail of the mosaic]]
The popularly named '''"Tomb of the Julii"''' (Mausoleum "M") survives in the [[Vatican Necropolis]] beneath [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. The serendipitous discovery near the [[crypt]] has a vaulted ceiling bearing a [[mosaic]] depicting [[Helios]] (Roman [[Sol Invictus]]) with an [[aureole]] riding in his chariot, within a framing of rinceaux of vine leaves, which are not given their usual pagan [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] reading in this context but are related to the True Vine imagery of [[Gospel of John]] 15.1. The mosaic is dated to the late 3rd century to early 4th century.  Other mosaics in this tomb depicting Jonah and the whale, the good shepherd carrying a lamb (the ''[[kriophoros]]'' motif), and fishermen have encouraged its interpretation as a Christian tomb.

This tomb was first discovered in 1574 AD when workmen accidentally broke through the ceiling while conducting some floor alterations in the basilica. The inside was briefly explored and documented before the opening was sealed over once more.&lt;ref&gt;The Bones of Saint Peter, John Evangelist Walsh 1982&lt;/ref&gt;
