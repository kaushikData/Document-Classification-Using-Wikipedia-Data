The '''alcoholic beverage industry in Europe''' is the source of a quarter of the world’s [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and over half of the world's [[wine]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last1=Anderson| first1=Peter|first2=Ben |last2= Baumberg|title=Report: Alcohol in Europe| publisher=Health-EU: The Public Health Portal of the European Union |date= June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade is even more centered on [[Europe]], with 70% of alcohol exports and just under half of the world's imports involving the [[European Union]] (EU). Although the majority of this trade is between EU countries, the trade in alcohol contributes around 9 billion [[euros]] to the goods account balance for the EU as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.org.uk/resources/publications/theglobe/globe200602/gl200602_p3.html#Anchor-Alcohol-49575 "Alcohol in Europe"] The Globe. 2006. Institute of Alcohol Studies. 25 Apr. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

At least 1 in 6 tourists returns from trips abroad with [[alcoholic drinks]], carrying an average of over 2 liters of pure alcohol per person in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Peter. "The Impact of Alcohol in Europe." Eurocare. 25 Apr. 2008 &lt;http://www.eurocare.org/euseminar/presentations/anderson-speech.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Europe also has a problem with illegal transport of alcohol; the European High Level Group on Fraud estimated that 1.5 billion euros were lost to alcohol fraud in 1996.&lt;ref name=fin&gt;Finfacts, Team. "Alcohol Taxation." FinFacts. 2007. FinFacts. 25 Apr. 2008 &lt;http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_10007222.shtml&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alcohol [[excise duties]] in the EU countries amounted to 25 billion euros in 2001, excluding sales taxes and other taxes paid within the supply chain – although 1.5 billion euros is given back to the supply chain through the [[Common Agricultural Policy]].&lt;ref name=fin/&gt; 

Alcohol is also associated with a number of jobs, including over 750,000 jobs in alcoholic beverage (mainly wine) production. Further jobs are also related to alcohol elsewhere in the supply chain, e.g. in pubs or shops.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Pasi. "Alcohol Policy Harmonization." Vatt-Discussion Papers. 1995. Government Institution for Economic Research. 25 Apr. 2008 &lt;http://www.vatt.fi/file/vatt_publication_pdf/k081.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2863">'''André Obey''' ({{IPA-fr|ɔbɛ|lang}}; 8 May 1892 at [[Douai]], [[France]] – 11 April 1975 at [[Montsoreau]], near the [[Loire River]]) was a prominent French playwright during the inter-war years, and into the 1950s.

He began as a [[novelist]] and produced an [[autobiographical novel]] about his [[adolescence]] ''le Joueur de triangle'' (The Triangle Player). After his meeting with [[Jacques Copeau]], he devoted himself completely to dramatic works. In 1945 Obey became provisional general administrator of the [[Comédie-Française]]. He was made full general administrator in 1946, and resigned in 1947 after just under a year's service.

Obey's play ''Le Viol de Lucrèce'' was drawn on by [[Ronald Duncan]] for the [[libretto]] of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s opera ''[[The Rape of Lucretia (opera)|The Rape of Lucretia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peabodyopera.org/seasons/s0607/lucretia07/|title=Opera at Peabody - The Rape of Lucretia|first=Roger|last=Brunyate|website=www.peabodyopera.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obey served as general administrator of the [[Comédie-Française]], in a provisional capacity from October 1945 until 6 April 1946, then with full powers until his resignation on 5 February 1947.

'''Austrian Business Agency''' ({{lang-de|Österreichische Industrieansiedlungs- und WirtschaftswerbungsgmbH}}) (ABA-Invest in Austria) is the national investment promotion company of the Republic of Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft (BMWFW) der Republik Österreich|Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy [http://www.bmwfw.gv.at www.bmwfw.gv.at]&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is responsible for acquiring and providing professional consulting services to foreign companies that intend to establish a subsidiary or business operations in Austria. ABA provides information about Austria as a business location and advises companies on all relevant issues. The business settlement agency was founded as ICD Austria by the [[:de:ÖIAG|ÖIAG]]&lt;ref&gt;ÖIAG - Österreichische Industrieholding AG, [http://www.oebib.gv.at www.oebib.gv.at]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1982, and renamed Austrian Business Agency (ABA) in 1995. On the occasion of its 25th anniversary in 2007, ABA changed its corporate design and now uses the name ABA-Invest in Austria instead of Austrian Business Agency, because it shows more clearly the purpose of the company. ABA-Invest in Austria employs a staff of 25 people.
 
ABA supported a series of prominent international companies such as Sony, Infineon, Ikea, Matsushita Electric Works, Hutchison Mobilfunk, Holmes Place and Starbucks in their setting up business operations in Austria.

A specialized organization belonging to ABA, [[:de:Location Austria|Location Austria]], has been promoting Austria as an international film location since 1998. Location Austria in cooperation with Austria Wirtschaftsservice GmbH (aws) is responsible for coordinating funding measures within the framework of the initiative "Film Industry Support Austria" (FISA). This comprises an initiative of the Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy to support cinema films based on a non-repayable grant amounting to 25 percent of the Austrian film production costs entitled to funding. Due to the major success of the initiative, the funding model "Film Industry Support Austria" (FISA) has been extended for another two years. For more information refer to [http://www.filmindustrysupportaustria.com www.filmindustrysupportaustria.com].

== Areas of activity ==
Austria is in competition with the international community of states to attract foreign direct investment. The national investment promotion company aims to promote the competitive advantages of Austria as a business location, and expand the awareness of Austria as an industrial nation. Austria is the fourth most prosperous country in the [[European Union|EU]],&lt;ref&gt;Eurostat 2016, BIP pro Kopf in KKS&lt;/ref&gt; but is primarily considered to be a tourist destination and a cultural mecca.

ABA supports foreign companies in establishing their own business in Austria. Potential investors are informed about Austria as a business location, as well as about the economic, political and legal framework. The areas of activity of ABA-Invest in Austria include setting up all necessary contacts in Austria, identification and selection of appropriate sites, compiling all relevant information for a company such as cost factors (e.g. labor and infrastructure costs), tax aspects or the performance of different business sectors in the country. ABA is also available as a consulting partner for all expansion investments.

== Foreign direct investments in Austria ==
ABA-Invest in Austria achieved record results in 2017, providing professional support to 344 international companies setting up business operations in Austria. Total investments amounted to EUR 723,85 million, creating 2,672 new jobs.

118 business location projects in 2017 originated in Germany, the traditionally strongest investor nation. Accordingly, Germany was responsible for 34% of all ABA projects. Interest on the part of Chinese companies remained consistently high. Eleven Chinese firms located in Austria in 2017 with the support of ABA, the same as in the previous year. 

There was particularly strong interest on the part of companies from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and from South East Europe (SEE). 99 companies, comprising close to one third of all new ABA business location projects came from CEE/SEE countries. Slovenia was ranked first (26 companies) followed by Hungary (18), Slovakia (14) and Russia (11). With 380 regional headquarters of multinational companies, headquarters location Austria is far ahead of its CEE competitors, namely Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Austria is in the top ranks when it comes to international ratings for “soft” location factors such as quality of life, legal certainty, health care infrastructure and a clean environment.&lt;ref&gt;World Competitiveness Yearbook 2016, „Quality of life“, “Pollution Problems”, “Health Infrastructure”, “Risk of political Instability”&lt;/ref&gt;

On balance, ABA-Invest in Austria has concluded 3,822 international business location projects, attracting total investments of EUR 9.17 billion and creating 57,710 jobs, since its founding in the year 1982.

'''''Codice di Avviamento Postale''''' (Postal Sending Code) is the [[Italy|Italian]] [[post code]] numeric system, consisting of five digits, such as 20121 [[Milan]]. Created in 1967, they are commonly known as CAP. The first two digits denote the administrative province (two provinces when a province has been split after 1967); the third digit shows if the town is the chief-town of the province (odd number, usually 1 or 9, e.g. 07100 [[Sassari]]) or not (even, usually 0 or 8, e.g. 10015 [[Ivrea]]); the last two digits the specific town or village or the delivery post office (only in new provinces created after 1992). In main cities like [[Rome]], [[Milan]], [[Naples]], [[Venice]] the last digits designate the urban postal district (usually 00 or 70 in minor provincial chief-towns). [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City]] are integrated into the Italian postcode system.

'''Cristina Takacs-Vesbach''' (born 1968) is an American [[microbial ecology|microbial ecologist]] studying microbes in [[Antarctica]]'s [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]].

== Early life and education ==
Takacs-Vesbach was born in [[New Jersey]] in 1968 and raised in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].  Originally, she had a fascination with [[astrophysics]], but after a sophomore-level course in [[biogeography]], taught by Dr. Alex Cruz at [[University of Colorado Boulder]], she was drawn to biology. She graduated in 1991 from CU Boulder with a BA in Environmental, Population, and Organismic Biology.

Takacs-Vesbach developed a passion for microbial ecology in Dr. Brad Tebo's laboratory at [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in [[San Diego]], CA in 1994.  Interested in microbial thermophiles of [[Yellowstone National Park]] research, she joined Dr. [[John Charles Priscu|John Priscu's]] laboratory at Montana State University in 1994. Takacs-Vesbach spent three field seasons in the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] as a graduate student, including one WinFly season. Takacs-Vesbach was one of two US women who were the first to spend WinFly in the McMurdo Dry Valleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/students-in-the-news/article_9e7cda3f-e5a6-56ba-863a-6c05d4da8dad.html|title=Students in the News|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Bozeman Daily Chronicle|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She completed her dissertation research on the factors affecting bacterioplankton biomass and productivity in Antarctic lakes 1999, graduating with a PhD in Microbial Ecology with a minor concentration in Biochemistry from [[Montana State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biology.unm.edu/core-faculty/takacs-vesbach.shtml|title=C. Takacs-Vesbach|last=|first=|date=|website=biology.unm.edu|publisher=[[University of New Mexico]]|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career and impact ==
Following graduation, Takacs-Vesbach took a three-year postdoctoral position with Dr. Anna-Louise Reysenbach at [[Portland State University]] where she conducted research on the [[thermophile]]s of Yellowstone National Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biology.unm.edu/vesbach/cv.html|title=Cristina Takacs-Vesbach: CV|last=|first=|date=|website=biology.unm.edu|publisher=University of New Mexico|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Takacs-Vesbach joined the faculty of the Department of Biology at the [[University of New Mexico]], awarded tenure in 2009 and promoted to full Professor in 2015.

Takacs-Vesbach’s contributions to Antarctic science have been in the field of microbial ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pw-t3hkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en|title=Cristina Vesbach|last=|first=|date=|website=scholar.google.com|publisher=Google Scholar|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until her doctoral research on
bacterioplankton biomass and productivity in the lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, bacterioplankton were considered unimportant. She used a forward difference model to show that not only are bacteria significant to the biomass of these lakes, but that substantial predation occurs every season to reduce bacterial biomass by up to 88% at the height of the growing season. Further work by Takacs-Vesbach in this system included estimates of bacterioplankton organic carbon demand and respiration rates. Takacs-Vesbach also contributed to the description of the first microbiological study of sub-glacial [[Lake Vostok]].  Along with her colleagues, Takacs-Vesbach reported the presence and activity of bacteria associated with the accretion ice &gt;4&amp;nbsp;km below the surface of the Antarctic polar plateau. This provided evidence that life may exist in inhospitable settings, which opened the possibility that other planetary bodies, such as [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] or [[Enceladus]], may harbor life today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/12/991210081424.htm|title=Team Led By MSU Biologist Finds Bacteria Deep In Antarctic Ice|last=|first=|date=1999|website=sciencedaily.com|publisher=[[Science Daily]]|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is only in the past few years that Lake Vostok and other similar subglacial lakes finally have been sampled, confirming the initial findings of Takacs-Vesbach and her colleagues that life can exist in the deep icy subsurface of Antarctica.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Douglas|date=2014-08-21|title=Lakes under the ice: Antarctica’s secret garden|url=http://www.nature.com/news/lakes-under-the-ice-antarctica-s-secret-garden-1.15729|journal=Nature|volume=512|issue=7514|pages=244–246|doi=10.1038/512244a|pmid=25143097|bibcode=2014Natur.512..244F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Takacs-Vesbach ’s Antarctic research focuses on the microbial diversity across various aquatic and soil habitats of the McMurdo Dry Valleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcmlter.org/content/biodiversity|title=Biodiversity|last=|first=|date=|website=mcmlter.org|publisher=McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work revealed microbial diversity in this system can be as high as temperate and tropical soils, and although activity is low, it is the highest reported activity per g of soil carbon. Takacs-Vesbach is interested in determining the spatial and temporal variations of microbial diversity, distribution, and function across all major McMurdo Dry Valley habitats, including [[cryoconite]]s, streams, lakes, and soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soils.org/discover-soils/story/climate-change-puts-spotlight-back-antarctic-soils|title=Climate change puts spotlight back on Antarctic soils|last=|first=|date=|website=soils.org|publisher=Soil Science Society of America|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcmlter.org/content/pulse-press-project|title=Pulse-Press Project|last=|first=|date=|website=mcmlter.org|publisher=McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Takacs-Vesbach was a member of the National Academy of Sciences Committee on the Development of a Strategic Vision for the [[United States Antarctic Program|U.S. Antarctic Program]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-08/naos-nrr081115.php|title=New report recommends research priorities for Antarctic and Southern Ocean science|website=EurekAlert!|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/read/21741/chapter/1#iii|title=A Strategic Vision for NSF Investments in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research|last=Medicine|first=National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and|date=2015-08-11|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780309373678|location=|pages=Chapter 1|doi=10.17226/21741|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the U.S. National Committee for the [[International Polar Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://learningcenter.nsta.org/products/symposia_seminars/ipy/bio.aspx|title=Cristina Takacs-Vesbach|last=|first=|date=|website=learningcenter.nsta.org|publisher=The NSTA Learning Center|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and honors ==
Takacs-Vesbach received the Outstanding Performance in a Doctoral Program Award during 1999 from the Montana State University Foundation, Bozeman. This competition is an annual university-wide competition among doctoral degree students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/read/11381/chapter/12#133|title=Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars|last=Council|first=National Research|date=2005-07-25|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780309097246|location=|pages=Appendix A|doi=10.17226/11381|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995-1999, she received the NASA-Montana Space Grant Fellowship from the Montana Space Grant Consortium, Bozeman. This grant came from a statewide competition offering a full scholarship and stipend for doctoral students, awarded to 2-3 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/students-in-the-news/article_9e7cda3f-e5a6-56ba-863a-6c05d4da8dad.html|title=Students in the News|last=Staff|first=Chronicle|website=Bozeman Daily Chronicle|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1995 and 1996, she received the Leopold Schepp Foundation Scholarship from the Leopold Schepp Foundation which is a national competition that recognizes students based on ability and character.

{{legend|blue|Yes}}
{{legend|red|No}}]]
A second '''referendum on the [[Maastricht Treaty]]''' was held in [[Denmark]] on 18 May 1993.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p525 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After rejecting the treaty in a [[Danish Maastricht Treaty referendum, 1992|referendum]] the previous year, this time it was approved by 56.7% of voters with an 86.5% turnout.&lt;ref name="euoplysningen"&gt;[http://www.eu-oplysningen.dk/dkeu/dk/afstemninger/afstemning/1993/ Maastricht-traktaten &amp; Edinburgh-afgørelsen 18. maj 1993] EU Oplysningen {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
It was the second attempt to ratify the Maastricht Treaty, which could not come into effect unless ratified by all members of the [[European Union]]. Thus, the [[Edinburgh Agreement (1992)|Edinburgh Agreement]] granted Denmark four exceptions from the Maastricht Treaty, leading to its eventual ratification.

==Aftermath==

When the result of the referendum was announced, the outcome and frustrations about the referendum being held only a year after the Danes had rejected the previous treaty led to riots in the [[Nørrebro]] area of [[Copenhagen]], {{Citation needed span|text=during which police trapped by a crowd fired 113 shots into the crowd|date=August 2018|reason=}} 11 people were subsequently treated for gunshot wounds as a result of the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1993/may/20/eu.politics|title=Police shoot 11 in Copenhagen as anti-Maastricht demonstrators riot after the result|last=John|first=Carvel|date=20 May 1993|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=15 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126192700/https://www.theguardian.com/world/1993/may/20/eu.politics|archive-date=26 January 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 90 police officers were injured during the riots.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[File:Dinos animals Louvre Cp11243.jpg|thumb|Attic ''dinos'', ca. 540 BC, [[Louvre]] Cp 11243]]
In the [[Typology of Greek vase shapes|typology of ancient Greek pottery]], the '''''dinos''''' (plural ''dinoi'') is a mixing bowl or cauldron. ''Dinos'' means "drinking cup," but in modern typology is used (wrongly) for the same shape as a ''[[lebes]]'', that is, a bowl with a spherical body meant to sit on a stand. It has no handles and no feet.&lt;ref&gt;Brian A. Sparkes, ''Greek Pottery: An Introduction'' (Manchester University Press, 1991), pp. 62, 81, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dinos Painter]], one of the ancient Greek artists known for [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase painting]], takes his name from the type of vase characteristic of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Sparkes, ''Greek Pottery'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dinos were used for mixing water and wine, as it was considered rude to drink straight out of the goblet, at the time.

'''Sir Douglas Mawson''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]&lt;ref name="frs"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alderman | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Tilley | first2 = C.

Along with [[Roald Amundsen]], [[Robert Falcon Scott]], and [[Ernest Shackleton]], he was a key expedition leader during the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]]. The [[Mawson Station]] in the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]] is named in his honour.

== Early life ==
Mawson was born on 5 May 1882 to Robert Ellis Mawson and Margaret Ann Moore.  He was born in [[Shipley, West Yorkshire]], but was less than two years old when his family immigrated to Australia and settled at [[Rooty Hill, New South Wales|Rooty Hill]], now in the western suburbs of Sydney. He attended [[Fort Street High School|Fort Street Model School]] and the [[University of Sydney]], where he graduated in 1902 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree.&lt;ref name="adb"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacka| first=F.

[[Image:Nla.pic-an6481117-v.jpg|thumb|right|Caricature by Sir [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]]]]

He was appointed geologist to an expedition to the [[New Hebrides]] (now [[Vanuatu]]) in 1903; his report, ''The Geology of the New Hebrides'', was one of the first major geological works of [[Melanesia]]. Also that year he published a geological paper on [[Mittagong, New South Wales]]. His major influences in his geological career were [[Edgeworth David|Professor Edgeworth David]] and [[Archibald Liversidge|Professor Archibald Liversidge]]. He then became a lecturer in [[petrology]] and [[mineralogy]] at the [[University of Adelaide]] in 1905.&lt;ref name="adb"/&gt; He identified and first described the mineral [[davidite]].

== Nimrod Expedition ==

Mawson joined [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Nimrod Expedition]] (1907–09) to the [[Antarctic]], originally intending to stay for the duration of the ship's presence in the first summer. Instead both he and his mentor, [[Edgeworth David]], stayed an extra year. In doing so they became, in the company of [[Alistair Mackay]], the first to climb the summit of [[Mount Erebus]] and to trek to the [[South Magnetic Pole]], which at that time was over land.

[[File:MawsonMcKayDavid.jpg|thumb|left| Mackay, David and Mawson raise the flag at the Magnetic South Pole on 16 January 1909]]

== Australasian Antarctic Expedition ==

Mawson turned down an invitation to join Robert Falcon Scott's [[Terra Nova Expedition]] in 1910; Australian geologist [[Griffith Taylor]] went with Scott instead. Mawson chose to lead his own expedition, the [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]], to [[King George V Land]] and [[Adelie Land]], the sector of the Antarctic continent immediately south of Australia, which at the time was almost entirely unexplored.
&lt;!-- almost, because Dumont d'Urville had visited in 1837 or something like that --&gt;
The objectives were to carry out geographical exploration and scientific studies, including a visit to the [[South Magnetic Pole]].
Mawson raised the necessary funds in a year, from British and Australian governments, and from commercial backers interested in [[Antarctica#Economy|mining]] and [[Whaling in Australia|whaling]].&lt;ref name=bbc-2014/&gt;

The expedition, using the ship [[SY Aurora|SY ''Aurora'']] commanded by Captain [[John King Davis]], departed from [[Hobart]] on 2 December 1911, landed at&amp;nbsp;[[Cape&amp;nbsp;Denison]] (named after [[Hugh Denison]], a major backer of the expedition) on [[Commonwealth Bay]] on 8 January 1912, and established the Main Base. A second camp was located to the west on the ice shelf in [[Queen Mary Land]]. Cape Denison proved to be unrelentingly windy; the average wind speed for the entire year was about {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, with some winds approaching {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. They built [[Mawson's Huts|a hut]] on the rocky cape and wintered through nearly constant [[blizzard]]s. Mawson wanted to do aerial exploration and brought the [[Air-tractor sledge|first aeroplane]] to Antarctica. The aircraft, a [[Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/artefacts/display_artefact.cfm?artefact_id=1118 CDWS-1 Air tractor tail]&lt;/ref&gt; was to be flown by [[Francis Howard Bickerton]]. When it was damaged in Australia shortly before the expedition departed, plans were changed so it was to be used only as a tractor on skis. However, the engine did not operate well in the cold, and it was removed and returned to [[Vickers]] in England. The aircraft fuselage itself was abandoned. On 1 January 2009, fragments of it were rediscovered by the Mawson's Huts Foundation, which is restoring the original huts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20100102/sc_nm/us_antarctica_plane Relic of Antarctica's first plane discovered on ice edge]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mawson's exploration program was carried out by five parties from the Main Base and two from the Western Base. Mawson himself was part of a three-man sledging team, the [[Far Eastern Party]], with [[Xavier Mertz]] and [[Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis|Lieutenant Belgrave Ninnis]], who headed east on 10 November 1912, to survey [[King George V Land]]. After five weeks of excellent progress mapping the [[coastline]] and collecting geological samples, the party was crossing the [[Ninnis Glacier]] 480&amp;nbsp;km east of the main base. Mertz was skiing and Mawson was on his [[sled]] with his weight dispersed, but Ninnis was jogging beside the second sled. Ninnis fell through a [[crevasse]], and his body weight is likely to have breached the snow bridge covering it. The six best dogs, most of the party's rations, their tent, and other essential supplies disappeared into the massive crevasse. Mertz and Mawson spotted one dead and one injured dog on a ledge 165&amp;nbsp;ft below them, but Ninnis was never seen again.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.south-pole.com/p0000099.htm www.south-pole.com&lt;/ref&gt;

After a brief service, Mawson and Mertz turned back immediately. They had one week's provisions for two men and no dog food but plenty of fuel and a [[Primus stove|primus]]. They sledged for 27 hours continuously to obtain a spare tent cover they had left behind, for which they improvised a frame from skis and a [[theodolite]]. Their lack of provisions forced them to use their remaining [[sled dog]]s to feed the other dogs and themselves:

{{quote|Their meat was stringy, tough and without a vestige of fat. For a change we sometimes chopped it up finely, mixed it with a little [[pemmican]], and brought all to the boil in a large pot of water. We were exceedingly hungry, but there was nothing to satisfy our appetites. Only a few ounces were used of the stock of ordinary food, to which was added a portion of dog's meat, never large, for each animal yielded so very little, and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs. They crunched the bones and ate the skin, until nothing remained.&lt;ref name=MawsonHomeBlizzard&gt;

There was a quick deterioration in the men's physical condition during this journey. Both men suffered [[dizziness]]; [[nausea]]; [[abdominal pain]]; [[irrationality]]; mucosal fissuring; skin, hair, and nail loss; and the [[yellowing]] of eyes and skin. Later Mawson noticed a dramatic change in his travelling companion. Mertz seemed to lose the will to move and wished only to remain in his sleeping bag. He began to deteriorate rapidly with diarrhoea and madness. On one occasion Mertz refused to believe he was suffering from [[frostbite]] and bit off the tip of his own little finger. This was soon followed by violent raging—Mawson had to sit on his companion's chest and hold down his arms to prevent him from damaging their tent. Mertz suffered further seizures before falling into a coma and dying on 8 January 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Bickel, Lennard (2000).

It was unknown at the time that [[Husky]] [[liver]] contains extremely high levels of [[vitamin A]]. It was also not known that such levels of vitamin A could cause liver damage to humans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitamin a#Toxicity|Vitamin A toxicity]]&lt;/ref&gt; With six dogs between them (with a liver on average weighing 1&amp;nbsp;kg), it is thought that the pair ingested enough liver to bring on a condition known as [[Hypervitaminosis A]]. However, Mertz may have suffered more because he found the tough muscle tissue difficult to eat and therefore ate more of the liver than Mawson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.student.bmj.com/issues/02/05/life/158.php |title=Man's Best Friend? |publisher=Student BMJ 2002;10:131–170 May |accessdate=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;While both men suffered, Mertz suffered more severely.

Mawson continued the final 100 miles alone. During his return trip to the Main Base he fell through the lid of a crevasse, and was saved only by his sledge wedging itself into the ice above him. He managed to climb out using the harness attaching him to the sled.

When Mawson finally made it back to [[Cape Denison]], the ship ''Aurora'' had left only a few hours before. It was recalled by [[wireless communication]], only to have bad weather thwart the rescue effort. Mawson and six men who had remained behind to look for him wintered a second year until December 1913. In Mawson's book ''Home of the Blizzard'', he describes his experiences. His party, and those at the Western Base, had explored large areas of the Antarctic coast, describing its [[Antarctica#Geology|geology]], [[Antarctica#Flora and fauna|biology]] and [[Climate of Antarctica|meteorology]], and more closely defining the location of the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. In 1915, the [[Royal Geographical Society]] awarded him their [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf |title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners |publisher=Royal Geographical Society |accessdate=24 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927221002/http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1916 the [[American Geographical Society]] awarded him the [[David Livingstone Centenary Medal]].&lt;ref name=honorslist&gt;[http://www.amergeog.org/honorslist.pdf "The Cullum Geographical Medal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326222952/http://www.amergeog.org/honorslist.pdf |date=26 March 2009 }}.

The expedition was the subject of [[David Roberts (climber)|David Roberts]]' book ''Alone on the Ice: The Greatest Survival Story in the History of Exploration''.

== ''Home of the Blizzard'' ==

In his book ''The Home of the Blizzard'', Mawson talked of "Herculean gusts" on 24 May 1912 which he learned afterwards "approached two hundred miles per hour".&lt;ref&gt;Mawson, D: "The Home of the Blizzard, Vol I", page 133, J. B. Lippincott, no date&lt;/ref&gt; Mawson reported that the average wind speed for March was 49 miles per hour; for April, 51.5 miles per hour; and for May, 67.719 miles per hour.&lt;ref&gt;Mawson, D: "The Home of the Blizzard, Vol I", page 134, J. B. Lippincott, no date&lt;/ref&gt; These [[katabatic wind]]s can reach around {{convert|300|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and led Mawson to dub Cape Denison "the windiest place on Earth".&lt;ref&gt;Trewby, M.

Mawson married Francisca Adriana (Paquita) Delprat (daughter of [[G. D. Delprat]]) on 31 March 1914 at Holy Trinity Church of England, [[Balaclava, Victoria|Balaclava]], Victoria. They had two daughters, Patricia and Jessica. Also in 1914, he was knighted, and was preoccupied with news of the [[Robert Falcon Scott|Scott disaster]] until the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Mawson served in the war as a major in the British [[Ministry of Munitions]]. Returning to the [[University of Adelaide]] in 1919, he was promoted to the professorship of geology and mineralogy in 1921, and made a major contribution to Australian geology. He organised and led the joint [[British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition]] in 1929–31, which resulted in the formation of the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]] in 1936. He also spent much of his time researching the geology of the northern [[Flinders Ranges]] in South Australia.

Upon his retirement from teaching in 1952 he was made an emeritus professor of the University of Adelaide. He died at his [[Brighton, South Australia|Brighton]] home on 14 October 1958 from a [[cerebral haemorrhage]].&lt;ref name="adb"/&gt; He was 76 years old. At the time of his death he had still not completed editorial work on all the papers resulting from his expedition, and this was completed by his eldest daughter, Patricia, only in 1975.

His image appeared from 1984 to 1996 on the [[Australian dollar|Australian]] paper [[Banknotes of the Australian dollar|one hundred dollar note]] and in 2012 on a $1 coin issued within the Inspirational Australians series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.coinupdate.com/sir-douglas-mawson-featured-on-australian-coin-1506/ Sir Douglas Mawson Featured on Australian $1 Coin]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mawson Peak]] ([[Heard Island]]), [[Mount Mawson]] ([[Tasmania]]), [[Mawson Station]] ([[Antarctica]]), [[Dorsa Mawson]] ([[Mare Fecunditatis]]), the geology building on the main [[University of Adelaide]] campus, suburbs in [[Mawson, Australian Capital Territory|Canberra]] and [[Mawson Lakes, South Australia|Adelaide]], a [[University of South Australia]]n campus and the main street of [[Meadows, South Australia|Meadows]], South Australia are named after him. At [[Oxley College (Burradoo, NSW)|Oxley College]] in [[Burradoo, New South Wales|Burradoo]], New South Wales, a sports house is called Mawson, as is at [[Clarence High School (Howrah, Tasmania)|Clarence High School]] in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], Forest Lodge Public School and [[Fort Street High School]], both in Sydney, where he was educated. The Mawson Collection of Antarctic exploration artefacts is on permanent display at the [[South Australian Museum]], including a screening of a recreated version of his journey that was shown on [[ABC Television]] on 12 May 2008.

Mawson (postcode 2607) is a suburb of Canberra, district of Woden Valley, Australian Capital Territory.  The suburb was gazetted in 1966 and is named after him. The theme for street names in this area is Antarctic exploration.

In 2011, [[Ranulph Fiennes]] included Mawson in his book ''My Heroes: Extraordinary Courage, Exceptional People''.

In 2013 an "Australian Mawson Centenary Expedition" was led by Australian Polar scientists [[Chris Turney]] and Chris Fogwill, of the [[University of New South Wales]], together with Antarctic veteran geologist and mountaineer Greg Mortimer and a group of scientists and adventurers. The expedition was centred on Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic oceanography, climate and biology. The ship, the [[Akademik Shokalskiy|MV ''Akademik Shokalskiy'']], became trapped in the Antarctic sea ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.explorersweb.com/polar/news.php?url=aae-trapped-in-antarctic-sea-ice_1388339068 |title=Australian Spirit of Mawson ship trapped in Antarctic sea ice |publisher=explorersweb.com |date=29 December 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, some of the expedition members revisited Mawson's huts at Cape Denison on Commonwealth Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/antarctica-live/video/2013/dec/25/mawsons-huts-journey-antarctica-video |title=Expedition to Mawson's Huts: a journey into Antarctica – video |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 December 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of Mawson's journals and other expedition records, some historians have questioned Mawson's navigation, risk-taking and leadership.&lt;ref name=bbc-2014&gt;Mark Pharoah, curator of the Mawson collection at the [[South Australia Museum]] in Adelaide. Cited by Andrew Luck-Baker, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25682462 Douglas Mawson: An Australian hero's story of survival], BBC News, 27 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, the first opera to be based on Mawson's 1911–14 expedition to Antarctica, "''The Call of Aurora''" (by Tasmanian composer Joe Bugden)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecallofaurora.com/|title=The Call of Aurora |date= December 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was performed at The Peacock Theatre in Hobart. "''The Call of Aurora''" investigates the relationship between Douglas Mawson and his wireless operator, [[Sidney Jeffryes]], who developed symptoms of paranoia and had to be relieved of his duties.

Mawson's book, ''Alone on the Ice'', and the deadly effect of dog liver are referenced in the plot of an episode of British television series ''[[New Tricks]]'', where it is used to commit the almost-perfect murder.

The '''Federation of International Employers''' / La Federación de Empresarios Internacionales (formerly The Federation of European Employers) was established in 1988 with the support of the European Commission. Today it operates independently and is the leading organisation for multinational [[employer]]s and is also known as FedEE 
Global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eubusiness.com/topics/sme/federation-of-european-employers/ |title= Federation of European Employers |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federation's principal aims are to assist companies to achieve legal compliance, operate more effectively at an international level, improve transnational HR capabilities, network with other international executives, develop practical/equitable pay structures, evaluate new employment methods and trends, monitor [[employee]] participation and [[trade union]] activities and embrace workforce diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing FedEE|url=http://www.fedee.com/fedee-global/|publisher=FedEE Global|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1988, the organisation was founded as the Federation of European Employers by current Secretary-General Robin E.J Chater in order to assist human resource professionals operating in Europe.

The head office was originally located in [[London]], UK - but with its relaunch in 2014 as a global organization the organization changed its operational headquarters to Bristol, UK and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cemea.economistconferences.com/content/robin-chater |title= Economist Conferences |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a further development in 2014, the Federation became the principal sponsor of a new business networking community called [[butN]]. The [[butN]] system allows business travelers to link up and meet face-to-face.

== Work of the Federation ==

In addition to providing legal information, updates and advice, the Federation compiles labour statistics and economic data, and creates policy checklists and model policies for service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.managers.org.uk/page/best-practice-healthy-workplace-healthy-workforce-guidance-managers |title= Best Practice: Healthy Workplace, Healthy Workforce - Guidance for Managers |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Areas of changes monitored by the Federation include: union developments (changes in structure, membership, campaigns, [[protest]]s and strike activity); evolution and operation of [[works councils]]; pay and benefit trends and new elements in [[collective agreements]]; remuneration; [[corporate governance]] rules and [[corporate ethics]]; income tax; health and safety; working time and leave; privacy at work; employee recruitment; work and residence permits; pensions and [[social security]]; financial participation plans; business transfers; termination of employment contracts; discrimination and [[equal opportunity]].

As an employers’ organisation, the Federation also acts as a [[think tank]] in a wide range of employment-related fields.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/law/article3707143.ece |title = In the City: Edward Fennell |last = Fennell |first = Edward |date = 7 March 2013 |website = The Times |accessdate= 2 October 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''France Musique''' is a [[France|French]] national public radio channel owned and operated by [[Radio France]]. It is devoted to the broadcasting of music, both live and recorded, with particular emphasis on [[European classical music|classical music]] and [[jazz]].

==History==
The channel was launched by [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française]] (RTF) in 1954 as ''La Chaîne Haute-Fidélité'', then renamed in 1958 as ''France IV Haute Fidélité'', as ''RTF Haute Fidélité'' in 1963, and finally as ''France Musique'' later in the same year. It was known between 1999 and 2005 as ''France Musiques''.

==Programming==
The channel's schedules feature the transmission of many live and "as live" concerts (that is to say, those recorded live for broadcast at a later date), including the majority of the concerts given by the [[Orchestre National de France]]. Many of the concerts organized by France Musique are also broadcast in Canada by [[CBC Radio 2]] as well as being relayed by other European classical music radio channels, such as [[BBC Radio 3]] in the United Kingdom.

== Mottoes ==
* 1975 : "La première radio en couleurs" (The first radio in colours)
* 1989 : "La musique un ton au-dessus" (Music one tone above)
* 1992 : "Jamais la musique ne vous aura touché d'aussi près" (Music will never have touched you so closely)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23026">The location of the '''geographical centre of Europe''' depends on the definition of the borders of [[Europe]], mainly whether remote islands are included to define the [[extreme points of Europe]], and on the method of calculating the final result. Thus, several places claim to host this hypothetical centre.
[[Image:Centre of Europe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|This map shows in red points some of the locations of claimants to the title of ''Centre of Europe'':&lt;br&gt;
[[Dilove]] (Rakhiv, Ukraine), [[Krahule]] (or [[Kremnické Bane]], Slovakia), [[Dresden]] and  [[Kleinmaischeid]] (Germany), [[Toruń]] and [[Suchowola]] (Poland), [[Bernotai]], or [[Purnuškės]] (Lithuania){{GeoGroupTemplate}}]]

The first official declaration of the Centre of Europe was made in 1775 by the Polish royal astronomer and cartographer [[Szymon Antoni Sobiekrajski]], who calculated it to be in the town of [[Suchowola]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/pl-pd-sw.html |title = Suchowola commune (Poland) |quote = In 1775 royal astronomer Szymon Antoni Sobiekrajski published a report in which he stated that Suchowola is the exact geographic centre of Europe }}&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Białystok]] in modern north-eastern [[Poland]]. The method used was that of calculating equal distances from the extreme points of Europe: the westernmost point in Portugal; the easternmost point in the Central Urals; the northernmost point in Norway; and the southernmost point in Greece (islands were not taken into consideration). There is a monument commemorating that definition in Suchowola {{coord|53|34|39|N|23|06|22|E|type:landmark|name=Suchowola, Poland (monument)}}.

==Current claimants==

==History of claims==
===[[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]]===
[[File:Podlaskie - Suchowola - Suchowola - Kościuszki - Park - Kamień centrum Europy 20110925 01.JPG|thumb|left|upright=.8|Monument in [[Suchowola]], [[Poland]]]]
The first official declaration of the Centre of Europe was made in 1775 by the Polish royal astronomer and cartographer [[Szymon Antoni Sobiekrajski]], who calculated it to be in the town of [[Suchowola]]&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; near [[Białystok]] in modern north-eastern [[Poland]]. The method used was that of calculating equal distances from the extreme points of Europe: the westernmost point in Portugal; the easternmost point in the Central Urals; the northernmost point in Norway; and the southernmost point in Greece (islands were not taken into consideration). There is a monument commemorating that definition in Suchowola {{coord|53|34|39|N|23|06|22|E|type:landmark|name=Suchowola, Poland (monument)}}.

===[[Austria-Hungary]]===
====[[Krahule]], modern day [[Slovakia]]====
[[Image:KremnickeBane-stred-europy.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.8|The marker stone in [[Kremnické Bane]], Slovakia]]
In about 1815 there was a declaration that the centre of Europe was located near the mining town of [[Kremnica]], on a hill that forms the water division between the basins of the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]], near St. John Baptist Church. The method used for calculating is unknown, but from the description given on the commemorative plaque located near the church {{coord|48|44|37|N|18|55|50|E|type:landmark|name=Kremnické Bane, Slovakia (monument)}}, it seems that it has been the centre of the smallest circle circumscribed on Europe (yet the limits of Europe taken into consideration are not known). The title of the "Centre of Europe" is also claimed by the neighbouring village [[Krahule]] (ancient Blaufuß), which used to belong to the same parish, now a famous centre for winter sports, with a hotel and recreation centre called "Stred Európy" ("Centre of Europe").

====[[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]], modern day [[Ukraine]]====
[[Image:Center of Europe - monument - nearby Rakhiv - Ukraine (5647-49).jpg|thumb|left||upright=.8|Austrian-Hungarian marker in Ukraine]]
In 1887, geographers from the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] set up a historical marker and a large stone in what is today a part of Ukraine, believed to mark the geographic centre of Europe. The interpretation of the worn [[Latin]] [[inscription]] on the [[monument]] is debated, with some claiming that the marker is merely one of a number of fixed [[triangulation]] points for surveying purposes established around the territory of the former empire. The external borders of Europe taken into account during the calculations are not known. According to the description, the methodology used for the calculation is that of the geometrical middle point of the extreme [[latitude]]s and [[longitude]]s of Europe, so the stone was located at {{coord|48|30|N|23|23|E|type:landmark}}. However, the actual location of the monument seems rather {{coord|47|57|46.47|N|24|11|14.4|E|type:landmark|name=Dilove, Ukraine (monument)}} and not the coordinates to which they relate. This is near the village of [[Dilove]] located on the [[Tisza]] river, close to the [[Romania]]n border, in the county of [[Rakhiv]] in the [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathian]] region.

=====Soviet measurements=====
Measurements done after [[World War II]] by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scientists reconfirmed the Austria-Hungarian claim that  [[Rakhiv]] and Dilove (in Russian: Rakhov and Dyelovoye) to be the geographical centre of Europe. The old marker in the small town was renewed, and a major campaign to convince everyone of its validity was undertaken.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

====[[Dyleň|Tillenberg/Dyleň]], modern day [[Czech Republic]]/[[Bavaria]]====
[[Image:Mittelpunkt Europas.jpg|thumb|left||upright=.7|Marker near [[Tillenberg]]]]
Austrian geographers also marked the 939-metre-high [[Tillenberg]] ([[Dyleň]]) near the [[Bohemia]]n city of [[Cheb|Eger/Cheb]] with a copper plate as the centre of Europe. As the border to Germany/Bavaria runs 100 m west of the mountaintop, the German village of [[Neualbenreuth]] uses this for promotional purposes. [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]] journalists asked the Institut für Geographie of the [[University of Munich]] to verify the claims. The institute concluded that the centre lies further to the south, in [[Hildweinsreuth]] near [[Flossenbürg]].

===[[Lithuania]]===

[[File:Travel time by car or ferry from the geographical center of Europe.jpg|thumb| Travel time by car or ferry from the geographical center in [[Lithuania]]]]
After a re-estimation of the boundaries of the [[continent]] of [[Europe]] in 1989, [[Jean-George Affholder]], a scientist at the [[Institut géographique national (France)|Institut Géographique National]] (French National Geographic Institute) determined that the geographic centre of Europe is located at {{coord|54|54|N|25|19|E|type:landmark|name=Purnuškės (centre of gravity)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://geosite.jankrogh.com/other.htm |title = Other Places of Interest: Central Europe |author = Jan S. Krogh }}&lt;/ref&gt; The method used for calculating this point was that of the [[centre of gravity]] of the [[geometry|geometrical figure]] of Europe.
This point is located in [[Lithuania]], near the village of Girija. A monument, composed by the sculptor Gediminas Jokūbonis and consisting of a column of white granite surmounted by a crown of stars, was erected at the location in 2004. An area of woods and fields surrounding the geographic centre point and including Lake Girija, Bernotai Hill, and an old burial ground, was set aside as a reserve in 1992. The State Tourism Department at the Ministry of Economy of Lithuania has classified the Geographic Centre monument and its reserve as a tourist attraction. 17&amp;nbsp;km away lies [[Europos Parkas]], ''Open Air Museum of the Centre of Europe'', a sculpture park containing the world's largest sculpture made of TV sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.europosparkas.lt |title = Europos Parkas: Open Air Museum of the Centre of Europe |publisher = EU PHARE 2001 Co-operation in the Baltic Sea Region Programme }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Belarus]]===
[[File:Polotsk Centr Evropy 1.JPG|thumb|left||upright=.8|Monument to the Geographical Centre of Europe in [[Polotsk]], [[Belarus]]]]
In 2000 Belarusian scientists Alexey Solomonov and Valery Anoshko published a report that stated the geographic centre of Europe was located near Lake Sho ({{coord|55|10|55|N|28|15|30|E}}; {{lang-be|Шо}}) in [[Vitsebsk Voblast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url = http://belarus-magazine.by/en.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1178358210&amp;archive=1183809402&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=4&amp;do=archives |publisher = Belarus Magazine |title = Letters stamped “From the center of Europe” |author=Igor Anisimov |issue=5 |year=2007 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/68GAUKHpW?url=http://belarus-magazine.by/en.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1178358210&amp;archive=1183809402&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=4&amp;do=archives |archivedate = 2012-06-08 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientists used a special computer program that takes Europe in a single entity - the White Sea and the Baltic Sea, Britain and Ireland were included in the program as continental zone objects. It is assumed that in the calculations to determine the center of Europe, one must take into account the inland waters of Europe and the Ural Mountains, the eastern border of Europe.

====[[Russia]]n confirmation====
Scientists from the Russian [[Central Research Institute of Geodesy, Aerial Survey and Cartography]] ({{lang-ru|ЦНИИГАиК}}) confirmed the calculations of Belarusian geodesists that the geographical centre of Europe is located in [[Polotsk]] {{coord|55|30|0|N|28|48|0|E}}. A small monument to the Geographical Centre of Europe was set up in Polotsk on May 31, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belta.by/ru/main_news_other?id=213117 Российские геодезисты подтвердили нахождение центра Европы в Полоцке - Главные новости - БЕЛТА - новости, события, факты, комментарии]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Estonia]]===
[[File:Eesti Saaremaa.png|thumb|left||upright=.8|[[Saaremaa]] island in western [[Estonia]]]]
It is claimed that if all the islands of Europe – from the [[Azores]] to [[Franz Joseph Land]] and from [[Crete]] to [[Iceland]] – are taken into consideration then the centre of Europe lies at {{coord|58|18|14|N|22|16|44|E|type:landmark|name=North of Torgu}} in the village of [[Mõnnuste]], on [[Saaremaa]] island in western [[Estonia]]. Again, no author and no method of calculation have been disclosed.

==Geographic centre of the European Union==
Other locations have claimed the title of geographic centre of Europe on the basis of calculations taking into account only the territory of those states which are members of the [[European Union]] (or formerly - [[European Community]]).

===IGN calculations===

As the European Union (EU) has grown in the last 50 years, so has the geographical centre shifted with each expansion.

The French [[Institut Géographique National]] (IGN) has been calculating the changing location of what it estimates to be the geographical centre of the EU since at least 1987. Its calculations exclude such [[Special member state territories and the European Union|extra-European territories]] of the EU as [[French Polynesia]].

===Other calculations===

The geographical midpoint of the European Union is not free from disputes, either. If some different [[extreme points of the European Union]], like some [[Atlantic Ocean]] islands, are taken into consideration this point is calculated in different locations.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Eurozone===
The original centre of the [[Eurozone]] is located in [[France]], and in various places for various periods. At some point of time it was near the village of [[Liernais]]. This location also changes with the accession of new countries into Eurozone (e.g. Slovakia 2009).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The island of '''[[Gozo]]''', which is today a part of [[Malta]], was independent for nearly three years between 1798 and 1801 during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. This brief period is sometimes known as '''''{{lang|it|La Nazione Gozitana}}''''' (lit. "The Gozitan Nation"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vella |first1=George |title=Outline History of the Circolo Gozitano |url=http://circologozitano.webs.com/history.htm |website=Circolo Gozitano |accessdate=2 November 2014 |date=5 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when Gozo was officially an independent state with [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand III of Sicily]] as its monarch, and with a provisional government led by [[Saverio Cassar]], who became Governor-general.

==History==
Until 10 June 1798, Malta and Gozo had been [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|administered]] by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]]. When Napoleon ousted the Knights from the islands in the [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798]], the French established garrisons in various locations in Malta, as well as the [[Cittadella (Gozo)|Cittadella]] and [[Fort Chambray]], the main fortifications on Gozo.

On 2 September 1798, the Maltese rebelled against the French in [[Mdina]], requesting to return under the "Kingdom of Sicily" rule. Word spread and the Gozitans revolted on 3 September. The [[archpriest]] and parish priest of the town of [[Victoria, Gozo|Rabat]], Saverio Cassar, was chosen as the revolt's leader on 18 September. The rebel headquarters was established in the [[Banca Giuratale (Victoria, Gozo)|Banca Giuratale]] (which is now the seat of the Victoria Local Council). Cassar organized the ''dejma'' and collected money to pay the troops under his command. Pro-French partisans were arrested, including three [[Canon (priest)|canons]].

The French garrison held out in the Cittadella and Fort Chambray, until they capitulated on 28 October after negotiations which were made with the help of Sir [[Alexander Ball]]. The 217 French soldiers there agreed to surrender without a fight and transferred the island, its fortifications, 24 cannons, a large quantity of ammunition, and 3,200 sacks of flour to the British.&lt;ref&gt;James, William. ''The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 2, 1797–1799.'' Conway Maritime Press, 2002 [1827], p 189. {{ISBN|0851779069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Citadel in Victoria.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Cittadella (Gozo)|Cittadella]], which the British transferred to the Gozitans on 29 October 1798]]

A day later, the British transferred control of the Cittadella and the rest of the island to the Gozitans. The people declared [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand III of Sicily]] as their monarch, and set up a provisional government led by Saverio Cassar, who became governor-general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cahoon|first1=Ben|title=Malta|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Malta.htm#Gozo|website=World Statesmen|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sciberras|first1=Sandro|title=Maltese History - F.

The Neapolitan flag (which later became the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies#Flags of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|flag of the Two Sicilies]]) was flown over Gozo, and munitions and supplies arrived from [[Naples]], with King Ferdinand praising his "faithful Maltese subjects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Castillo|first1=Dennis Angelo|title=The Maltese Cross: A Strategic History of Malta|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=[[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]]|isbn=9780313323294|page=120|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=i5ns5LNtoiUC&amp;pg=120#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October, Cassar requested that Gozo becomes a separate diocese. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Gozo]] was eventually created on 22 September 1864, 65 years after Cassar's petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Note|url=http://gozodiocese.org/about-us/historical-note/|publisher=Gozo Diocese|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Cassar's rule of Gozo, he organized the administration, reopened the law courts and elected new jurists; and even opened a customs house.

When the French garrison in [[Valletta]] surrendered in September 1800, Malta became a [[Malta Protectorate|British Protectorate]]. Cassar continued to rule Gozo independently until 20 August 1801, when the British [[List of Civil Commissioners of Malta|Civil Commissioner]], [[Charles Cameron (governor)|Charles Cameron]], removed him from the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiavone|first1=Michael J.|title=Dictionary of Maltese Biographies A-F|date=2009|publisher=Publikazzjonijiet Indipendenza|location=[[Malta]]|isbn=9789993291329|pages=533–534}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emmanuel Vitale]], another leader of the Maltese insurrection, became Governor, Superintendent and the Health Director of Gozo, a post which he held until his death fourteen months later.

On 16 December 1805, Cassar died at the age of 58.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2596">The varied difficulties experienced by the copper industry after the depths of the [[Great Depression]] were followed by the idea of getting relief through some form of [[collective action]] in order to reduce the intensity of competition. In this way on March, 28th, 1935, the '''International Copper Cartel''' ('''ICC''')  was formed. There were five members in the [[cartel]] and two friendly foreign observers. The voting members were: Anaconda, Kennecott, Roan Antelope (Mufulira, Northern Rhodesia), Rhokana (Northern Rhodesia) and Union Miniere de Haut Katanga (Belgian Congo), while the non voting members were Bor (Yugoslavia) and Rio Tinto (Spain).  Combined, these seven companies accounted for more than half of the global output of refined copper at that time. The main difference between this and the previous copper cartels is that the ICC members did not attempt to set uniform prices. Rather, they merely wanted to influence prices indirectly, smoothing out wide price fluctuations (Walters, 1944). Despite the immense profits earned by the ICC's members in the following decades, the ICC was never reproached for charging exorbitant prices, as opposed to what happened in the case of previous cartels. Indeed, in Herfindahl’s opinion the cartel did not have any significant effect on price. These are born out in USGS annual price data showing the annual average price of copper in US Dollar per pound (2204.3 lb per metric ton), if one adjusts for the US Consumer Price Index.  

Herfindahl (1959) posits that the cartel members returned to the Nash-Cournot competition once the pivotal or trigger price was exceeded. On the other hand, Montero and Guzmán (2005) posit that the cooperative behavior could have continued in booms, but using output-expanding strategies in order to restrict the entry of the competitive fringe.

The '''International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization''' ('''ITCILO''') is the training arm of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO). It runs training, learning and capacity development services for governments, employers' organizations, workers' organizations and other national and international partners in support of Decent Work and sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itcilo.org/en/the-centre/about-us|title=Mission and impact of the ITCILO|work=itcilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the [[United Nations]] System. 

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Board ==
Given its tripartite structure, the Centre is governed by a [[Board of directors|Board]] composed of representatives of governments, workers' and employers' organizations. The Board approves the annual programme and budget, provides strategic guidance and direction to the management of the Centre, proposes adjustments to reflect changing priorities and resources, and through the review of internal and external audit reports, exercises an oversight role in relation to financial and internal governance matters. The Board meets annually and is chaired by the Director-General of the ILO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itcilo.org/en/the-centre/board-documents|title=Governing Board Documents|work=itcilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:P2170048_copy.jpg|thumb|The President of the Italian Republic Mr. [[Giuseppe Saragat]] ITCILO]]

In the 1950s and 1960s, following decolonization, the Governing Body of the ILO sought a permanent facility that could produce agents of development for emerging nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ITCILO. 40 years at the service of development and social justice|last=|first=|publisher=International Training Centre of the ILO|year=2005|isbn=|location=Turin|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1961, the Italian Government, during the century of Italian unity celebrated in Turin, offered the “Italia 61” premises. 
In May 1963, the ILO’s Governing Body unanimously adopted the Centre’s statute and established, in collaboration with the Italian Government, the International Training Centre on 24 October 1964. The agreement was signed by Giuseppe Saragat, Minister of Foreign Affairs, for the Italian Government, and by David A. Morse, Director-General for the ILO. 
By 1 October 1965, the International Centre for Advanced Technical and Vocational Training was opened.

==Training==


Regular programmes are offered in a multicultural and multilingual environment at the campus or through e-learning.

The '''Irish Free State''' ({{lang-ga|Saorstát Éireann}} {{IPA-ga|ˈsˠiːɾˠ.sˠt̪ˠaːt̪ˠ ˈeːɾʲən̪ˠ|pron}}; 6 December 1922{{spaced ndash}}29 December 1937) was a [[State (polity)|state]] established in 1922 under the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of December 1921. That treaty ended the three-year [[Irish War of Independence]] between the forces of the self-proclaimed [[Irish Republic]], the [[Irish Republican Army (1919–22)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), and [[The Crown|British Crown]] forces.

The Free State was established as a [[Dominion]] of the [[British Commonwealth of Nations]]. It comprised 26 of the 32 [[counties of Ireland]]. [[Northern Ireland]], which comprised the remaining six counties, exercised its right under the Treaty to opt out of the new state. The Free State government consisted of the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]], the representative of the King, and the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]] (cabinet), which replaced both the revolutionary [[Government of the 2nd Dáil|Dáil Government]] and the [[Provisional Government of Ireland (1922)|Provisional Government]] set up under the Treaty. [[W. T. Cosgrave]], who had led both of these governments since August 1922, became the first [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]] (prime minister). The [[Oireachtas (Irish Free State)|Oireachtas]] or legislature consisted of [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Free State)|Dáil Éireann]] (the lower house) and [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Seanad Éireann]], also known as the Senate. Members of the Dáil were required to take an [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance to the Constitution of the Free State and to declare fidelity to the king]]. The oath was a key issue for opponents of the Treaty, who refused to take the oath and therefore did not take their seats. Pro-Treaty members, who formed [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] in 1923, held an effective majority in the Dáil from 1922 to 1927, and thereafter ruled as a minority government until 1932. 

In 1931, with the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] relinquished its remaining authority to legislate for the Free State and the other dominions. This had the effect of making the dominions fully sovereign states. The Free State thus became the first internationally recognised independent Irish state.

In the first months of the Free State, the [[Irish Civil War]] was waged between the newly established [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] and the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–69)|anti-Treaty IRA]], who refused to recognise the state. The Civil War ended in victory for the government forces, with the anti-Treaty forces dumping their arms in May 1923. The anti-Treaty political party, [[Sinn Féin]], refused to take its seats in the Dáil, leaving the relatively small [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] as the only opposition party. In 1926, when Sinn Féin president [[Éamon de Valera]] failed to have this policy reversed, he resigned from Sinn Féin and founded [[Fianna Fáil]]. Fianna Fáil entered the Dáil following the [[Irish general election, June 1927|1927 general election]], and entered government after the [[Irish general election, 1932]], when it became the largest party.

De Valera abolished the Oath of Allegiance and embarked on an [[Anglo-Irish Trade War|economic war]] with the UK. In 1937 he drafted a new [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]], which was passed by a [[Irish constitutional plebiscite, 1937|referendum]] in July of that year. The Free State came to an end with the coming into force of a [[constitution of Ireland|new constitution on 29 December 1937]] when the state took the name “Ireland”.

==Historical background==
The [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, and particularly the execution of fifteen people by firing squad, the imprisonment or internment of hundreds more, and the imposition of martial law, caused a profound shift in public opinion towards [[Irish republicanism|the republican cause in Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie Coleman, ''The Republican Revolution, 1916-1923'', Routledge, 2013, chapter 2 "The Easter Rising", pp. 26-8.  {{ISBN|140827910X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, opposition increased to [[Ireland in World War I|Ireland's participation in World War I]] in Europe and the Middle East. This came about when the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] supported the [[Allies of World War I|Allied cause]] in World War I in response to the passing of the [[Home Rule Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill in 1914]]. Many people had begun to doubt whether the Bill, passed by Westminster in September 1914, but suspended for the duration of the war, would ever come into effect. Due to the war situation [[Spring offensive|deteriorating badly]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in April 1918, which coincided with the publication of the final report and recommendations of the [[Irish Convention#Europe intervenes|Irish Convention]], the British Cabinet drafted a doomed "dual policy" of introducing Home Rule linked to [[compulsory military service]] for Ireland which it eventually had to drop.  Sinn Féin, the Irish Party, and all other Nationalist elements joined forces in opposition to the idea during the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]].  At the same time, the Irish Parliamentary Party lost in support on account of the crisis.  Irish republicans felt further emboldened by successful anti-monarchical revolutions in the [[Russian Empire]] (1917), the [[German Empire]] (1918), and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (1918).  In the [[Irish general election, 1918|December 1918 General Election]], [[History of Sinn Féin|Sinn Féin]] won a large majority of the Irish seats in the Westminster parliament of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]: 73 of the 105 constituencies returned Sinn Féin members (25 uncontested).  The Sinn Féin party, founded by [[Arthur Griffith]] in 1905, had espoused non-violent separatism. Under [[Éamon de Valera]]'s leadership from 1917, it campaigned [[Physical force Irish republicanism|aggressively and militantly]] for an Irish republic.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

On 21 January 1919, Sinn Féin MPs (who became known as ''[[Teachta Dála]]'', TDs), refusing to sit at [[Westminster]], assembled in Dublin and formed a single-chamber Irish parliament called [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Republic)|Dáil Éireann]] (Assembly of Ireland). It affirmed the formation of an Irish Republic and passed a [[Declaration of Independence]], calling itself ''Saorstát Éireann'' (Irish Free State) in [[Irish Gaelic]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...the Irish people is resolved... to promote the common weal, to re-establish justice... with equal rights and equal opportunity for every citizen."{{fact|date=May 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the less than overwhelming majority&lt;ref&gt;[[John Joseph Lee|J. J. Lee]]:  ''Ireland 1912-1985 Politics and Society''  p.41, Cambridge University Press (1989, 1990) {{ISBN|9780521266482}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Irish people accepted this course,&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Mitchell, "Revolutionary Government in Ireland: Dáil Éireann 1919-22" (Dublin 1995), p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States|America]]&lt;ref&gt;Townshend, p.70.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;Townshend, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; were targeted to recognise the Irish Republic internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, "Impressions of Sinn Féin in America" (Dublin 1919), cited by C Townshend, "The Republic: The Fight for Irish Independence" (Penguin 2014), 66-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Message to the Free Nations of the World called on: &lt;blockquote&gt;"...every free nation to support the Irish Republic by recognizing Ireland's national status... the last outpost of Europe towards the West... demanded by the Freedom of the Seas."&lt;ref&gt;Macardle, Dorothy, "Irish Republic 1911-1923" (London 1937)  Appendix 1, no.10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Anglo-Irish War|War of Independence]] (1919–1921) pitted the army of the Irish Republic, the [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] (known subsequently as the "Old IRA" to distinguish it from later organisations of that name), against the [[British Army]], the [[Black and Tans]], the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]], the [[Auxiliary Division]], the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]], the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] and the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]]. On 9 July 1921 a truce came into force. By this time the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Ulster Parliament]] had opened, established under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]], and presenting the republican movement with a ''fait accompli'' and guaranteeing the British permanent entanglement in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Garvin, Tom: ''The Evolution of Irish Nationalist Politics'' : p.143 ''Elections, Revolution and Civil War'' Gill &amp; Macmillan (2005) {{ISBN|0-7171-3967-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 October negotiations opened between the British Prime Minister, [[David Lloyd George]], and Arthur Griffith, who headed the Irish Republic's delegation.  The Irish Treaty delegation (Griffith, Collins, Duggan, Barton, and Gavan Duffy) set up headquarters in [[Hans Place]], Knightsbridge. On 5 December 1921 at 11:15 am the delegation decided during private discussions at 22 Hans Place to recommend the negotiated agreement to the Dáil Éireann; negotiations continued until 2:30 am on 6 December 1921, after which the parties signed [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]].
Nobody had doubted that these negotiations would produce a form of Irish government short of the independence wished for by republicans.{{original research inline|date=May 2016}} The United Kingdom could not offer a republican form of government without losing prestige and risking demands for something similar throughout the Empire.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Furthermore, as one of the negotiators, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], later admitted (and he would have known, given his leading role in the independence war), the IRA at the time of the truce was weeks, if not days, away from collapse, with a chronic shortage of ammunition. "Frankly, we thought they were mad", Collins said of the sudden British offer of a truce – although the republicans would probably have continued the struggle in one form or another, given the level of public support.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Thornton told a meeting, related in Sean O' Sullivan's Memoir, "Make no mistake the IRA was going to fight and going to make the Irish Republic a living fact." cited by Townshend, p.89., Military Archives, Ireland, CD 308/1/5&lt;/ref&gt; Since Lloyd George had already, after the truce had come into effect, made it clear to [[President of the Irish Republic|President of the Republic]], Éamon de Valera, "that the achievement of a republic through negotiation was impossible",&lt;ref&gt;Lee, J. J., p.47&lt;/ref&gt; de Valera decided not to become a member of the treaty delegation and so not to risk more militant republicans labelling him as a "sellout". Yet his own proposals – published in January 1922 – fell far short of an autonomous all-Ireland republic.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Sinn Féin's abstention was unambiguous.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

As expected, the Anglo-Irish Treaty explicitly ruled out a republic. It offered Ireland [[dominion]] status, as a state within the then [[British Empire]] – equal to Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Although less than expected by the Sinn Féin leadership, this deal offered substantially more than the initial form of [[Irish Home Rule movement|home rule]] within the United Kingdom sought by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] from 1880, and represented a serious advance on the Home Rule Bill of 1914 that the Irish nationalist leader [[John Redmond]] had achieved through parliamentary proceedings. However, it all but confirmed the [[partition of Ireland]] between [[Northern Ireland]] and the Irish Free State. The [[Second Dáil]] in Dublin ratified the Treaty (7 January 1922), splitting Sinn Féin in the process.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Arthur Griffith addressing the Dail on 14 December 1921 said "Well, we have brought back Irish freedom and Irish independence ... Ireland is as free as Canada and Australia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates+authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/dail1921121400004?opendocument&amp;highlight=%22independent+country%22|title=Parliamentary Debates|first=Fujitsu/Oireachtas Lotus Notes/Domino Development|last=Team|website=oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Speaking in Dail Eireann on 21 September 1922, Gavan Duffy TD, one of the signatories of the treaty, stated: "The Governor-General will have to do exactly as he is told by Dominion Ministers, and it is proposed, and warmly advocated, that he should cease altogether to be the representative of Great Britain. Let him represent the Imperial Crown, but let Great Britain send Ambassadors to her Dominions, as she does to other countries, because they are in fact independent countries voluntarily uniting themselves with Great Britain and not a gang of subject States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1922-09-21/9/|title=Parliamentary Debates|website=oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Ireland "opts out"==
The Treaty, and the legislation introduced to give it legal effect, implied that Northern Ireland would be a part of the Free State on its creation,&lt;ref name="historical-debates.oireachtas.ie"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Boundary Question: Debate Resumed, Dáil Éireann, 20 June 1924|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1924/06/20/00032.asp|website=Oireachteas.ie|accessdate=30 September 2015|quote=Article 12 of the Treaty reads: 'If before the expiration of the said month an address is presented to his Majesty by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland to that effect, the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland.'

The Treaty was given legal effect in the United Kingdom through the [[Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922]]. That act, which established the Free State, allowed Northern Ireland to "opt out" of it.&lt;ref name="historical-debates.oireachtas.ie"/&gt; Under Article 12 of the Treaty, Northern Ireland could exercise its option by presenting an address to the King requesting not to be part of the Irish Free State. Once the Treaty was ratified, the Houses of Parliament of Northern Ireland had one month (dubbed the "Ulster month") to exercise this option during which month the Government of Ireland Act continued to apply in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbons|first1=Ivan|title=The British Labour Party and the Establishment of the Irish Free State, 1918-1924|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1137444088|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pO6_CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realistically it was always certain that Northern Ireland would opt out of the Free State.  The [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], [[Sir James Craig]], speaking in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]] in October 1922 said that "when 6 December is passed the month begins in which we will have to make the choice either to vote out or remain within the Free State". He said it was important that that choice be made as soon as possible after 6 December 1922 "in order that it may not go forth to the world that we had the slightest hesitation".&lt;ref&gt;Northern Ireland Parliamentary Debates, 27 October 1922&lt;/ref&gt; On the following day, 7 December 1922, the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]] resolved to make the following address to the King so as to opt out of the Irish Free State:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&amp;pageno=1145#bak-2-1149|title=The Stormont Papers - View Volumes|first=Alastair|last=Dunning|date=1 October 2006|website=stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN, We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senators and Commons of Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, having learnt of the passing of the [[Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922|Irish Free State Constitution Act, 1922]], being the Act of Parliament for the ratification of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, do, by this humble Address, pray your Majesty that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland.}}

Discussion in the Parliament of the address was short. Prime Minister Craig left for London with the memorial embodying the address on the night boat that evening, 7 December 1922. The King received it the following day, ''The Times'' reporting:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Houses of Parliament of Northern Ireland had not made such a declaration, under Article 14 of the Treaty Northern Ireland, its Parliament and government would have continued in being but the [[Oireachtas]] would have had jurisdiction to legislate for Northern Ireland in matters not delegated to Northern Ireland under the Government of Ireland Act. This, of course, never came to pass.

On 13 December 1922 Prime Minister Craig addressed the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]] informing them that the King had responded to the Parliament's address as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&amp;pageno=1145#fwd-2-1189|title=The Stormont Papers - View Volumes|first=Alastair|last=Dunning|date=1 October 2006|website=stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governmental and constitutional structures==
[[File:Saorstát Éireann.png|thumb|upright=0.9|A symbol most often associated with the new state's [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs|postal system]].]]
The Treaty established that the new Irish Free State would be a [[constitutional monarchy]], with a Governor-General as representative of the Crown.  The ''[[Constitution of the Irish Free State]]'' made more detailed provision for the state's system of government, with a three-tier parliament, called the [[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State|Oireachtas]], made up of the King and two houses, Dáil Éireann and [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Seanad Éireann]] (the Irish Senate). 

Executive authority was vested in the King, with the Governor-General as his representative. He appointed a cabinet called the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]] to "aid and advise" him. The Executive Council was presided over by a prime minister called the [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]]. In practice, most of the real power was exercised by the Executive Council, as the Governor-General was almost always bound to act on the advice of the Executive Council.

===Representative of the Crown===
{{Main article|Governor-General of the Irish Free State}}
The King in the Irish Free State was represented by a [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]]. The office replaced the previous [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], who had headed English and British administrations in Ireland since the Middle Ages. Governors-General were appointed by the King initially on the advice of the British Government, but with the consent of the Irish Government. From 1927 the Irish Government alone had the power to advise the King whom to appoint.

===Oath of Allegiance===
As with all dominions, provision was made for an Oath of Allegiance. Within dominions, such oaths were taken by parliamentarians personally towards the monarch. The [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Irish Oath of Allegiance]] was fundamentally different. It had two elements; the first, an ''oath to the Free State, as by law established'', the second part a promise of ''fidelity, to His Majesty, King George V, his heirs and successors''. That second fidelity element, however, was qualified in two ways. It was to the King ''in'' Ireland, not specifically to the King of the United Kingdom. Secondly, it was to the King explicitly in his role as part of the Treaty settlement, not in terms of pre-1922 British rule. The Oath itself came from a combination of three sources, and was largely the work of Michael Collins in the Treaty negotiations. It came in part from a draft oath suggested prior to the negotiations by President de Valera. Other sections were taken by Collins directly from the Oath of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB), of which he was the secret head. In its structure, it was also partially based on the form and structure used for 'Dominion status'.

Although 'a new departure', and notably indirect in its reference to the monarchy, it was criticised by nationalists and republicans for making any reference to the Crown, the claim being that it ''was'' a direct oath to the Crown, a fact demonstrably incorrect by an examination of its wording.  But in 1922 Ireland and beyond, it was the perception, not the reality, that influenced public debate on the issue.  Had its original author, Michael Collins, survived, he might have been able to clarify its actual meaning, but with his assassination in August 1922, no major negotiator to the Oath's creation on the Irish side was still alive, available or pro-Treaty. (The leader of the Irish delegation, [[Arthur Griffith]], had also died in August 1922). The Oath became a key issue in the resulting [[Irish Civil War]] that divided the pro- and anti-treaty sides in 1922–23.

==Irish Civil War==
{{Main article|Irish Civil War}}
The compromises contained in the agreement caused the [[Irish Civil War|civil war]] in the 26 counties in June 1922&amp;mdash;April 1923, in which the pro-Treaty [[Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|Provisional Government]] defeated the anti-Treaty Republican forces. The latter were led, nominally, by [[Éamon de Valera]], who had resigned as President of the Republic on the treaty's ratification. His resignation outraged some of his own supporters, notably [[Seán T. O'Kelly]], the main Sinn Féin organizer. On resigning, he then sought re-election but was defeated two days later on a vote of 60–58. The pro-Treaty Arthur Griffith followed as President of the Irish Republic. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] was chosen at a meeting of the members elected to sit in the [[House of Commons of Southern Ireland]] (a body set up under the Government of Ireland Act 1920) to become [[Chairman of the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State]] in accordance with the Treaty. The [[Irish general election, 1922|general election]] in June gave overwhelming support for the pro-Treaty parties. [[W. T. Cosgrave]]'s Crown-appointed Provisional Government effectively subsumed Griffith's republican administration with the death of both Collins and Griffith in August 1922.

=="Freedom to achieve freedom"==
[[File:Irish Free State passport.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Irish passport|Irish Free State passport]] (holder's name removed)]]

===Governance===
The following were the principal parties of government of the Irish Free State between 1922 and 1937:
* [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] under W. T. Cosgrave (1922–32)
* [[Fianna Fáil]] under Éamon de Valera (1932–37)

===Constitutional evolution===
[[File:Stamp irl 1922 2N6se.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Overprint]]ed stamp]]
Michael Collins described the Treaty as "the freedom to achieve freedom". In practice, the Treaty offered most of the symbols and powers of independence. These included a functioning, if disputed, [[Representative democracy|parliamentary democracy]] with its own executive, judiciary and written constitution which could be changed by the [[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State|Oireachtas]].  Although an [[Irish republic]] had not been on offer, the Treaty still afforded Ireland more internal independence than it had possessed in over 400 years, and far exceeded the most optimistic goals of the [[Irish Home Rule movement|Home Rule movement]]. However, a number of conditions existed:

* The King remained king ''in'' Ireland;
* Britain retained the so-called strategic [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]] on Ireland's south coast which were to remain occupied by the [[Royal Navy]]; 
* Prior to the passage  of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], the UK government continued to have a role in Irish governance. Officially the representative of the King, the Governor-General also received instructions from the British Government on his use of the [[Royal Assent]], namely a Bill passed by the Dáil and Seanad could be Granted Assent (signed into law), Withheld (not signed, pending later approval) or Denied (vetoed).  The [[letters patent]] to the first Governor-General, [[Timothy Michael Healy|Tim Healy]], explicitly named Bills that were to be rejected if passed by the Dáil and Seanad, such as any attempt to abolish the Oath. In the event, no such Bills were ever introduced, so the issue was moot.

* As with the other dominions, the Irish Free State had a status of association with the UK rather than being completely legally independent from it. However the meaning of 'Dominion status' changed radically during the 1920s, starting with the [[Chanak crisis]] in 1922 and quickly followed by the directly negotiated [[Halibut Treaty]] of 1923. The [[1926 Imperial Conference]] declared the equality [including the UK] of all member states of the Commonwealth.  The Conference also led to a reform of the King's title, given effect by the ''[[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]]'', which changed the King's royal title so that it took account of the fact that there was no longer a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The King adopted the following style by which he would be known in all of his Empire: ''By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India''. That was the King's title in Ireland just as elsewhere in his Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Long after the Irish Free State had ceased to exist, when [[Elizabeth II]] ascended the Throne, the [[Royal Titles Act 1953]][http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/9] was passed, as were other Acts concerning her Style in other parts of the Empire. Until then the British monarch had only one style. The King was never simply the "King of Ireland" or the "King of the Irish Free State".&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the conduct of external relations, the Irish Free State tried to push the boundaries of its status as a Dominion.  It 'accepted' credentials from international ambassadors to Ireland, something no other dominion up to then had done.  It registered the treaty with the [[League of Nations]] as an international document, over the objections of the United Kingdom, which saw it as a mere ''internal'' document between a dominion and the United Kingdom.  Entitlement of citizenship of the Irish Free State was defined in the [[Irish Free State Constitution]], but the status of that citizenship was contentious. One of the first projects of the Irish Free State was the design and production of the [[Great Seal of the Irish Free State|Great Seal of Saorstát Éireann]] which was carried out on behalf of the Government by [[Hugh Kennedy]].

The [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] (of 1931), embodying a decision of an Imperial Conference, enabled each dominion to enact new legislation or to change any extant legislation, without resorting to any role for the British parliament that may have enacted the original legislation in the past. This change made the dominions, including the Free State, ''de jure'' sovereign nations — fulfilling Collins' vision of having "the freedom to achieve freedom". 

The Free State symbolically marked these changes in two mould-breaking moves soon after winning internationally recognised independence:
* It sought, and got, the King's acceptance to have an Irish minister, to the complete exclusion of British ministers, formally advising the King in the exercise of his powers and functions as King in the Irish Free State.  Two examples of this are the signing of a treaty between the Irish Free State and the [[Portugal|Portuguese Republic]] in 1931, and the act recognising the [[abdication crisis|abdication]] of [[King Edward VIII]] in 1936 separately from the recognition by the British Parliament.
* The unprecedented replacement of the use of the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] and its replacement by the [[Great Seal of the Irish Free State]], which the King awarded to the Irish Free State in 1931.  (The Irish Seal consisted of a picture of 'King George V' enthroned on one side, with the Irish state harp and the words ''Saorstát Éireann'' on the reverse. It is now on display in the Irish National Museum, [[Collins Barracks (Dublin)|Collins Barracks]] in Dublin.)

When Éamon de Valera became President of the Executive Council (prime minister) in 1932 he described Cosgrave's ministers' achievements simply. Having read the files, he told his son, Vivion, "they were magnificent, son".

The Statute of Westminster allowed de Valera, on becoming President of the Executive Council (February 1932), to go even further.  With no ensuing restrictions on his policies, he abolished the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]] (which Cosgrave intended to do had he won the [[Irish general election, 1932|1932 general election]]), the Senate, university representation in the Dáil, and appeals to the [[Privy Council]].
One major policy error occurred in 1936 when he attempted to use the abdication of [[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]] to abolish the crown and governor-general in the Free State with the "Constitution (Amendment No. 27 Act)". He was advised by senior law officers and other constitutional experts that, as the crown and governor-generalship existed separately from the constitution in a vast number of acts, charters, orders-in-council, and letters patent, they both still existed.  A second bill, the "[[Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937|Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1937]]" was quickly introduced to repeal the necessary elements. De Valera retroactively dated the second act back to December 1936.

===Currency===

The new state continued to use sterling from its inception; there is no reference in the Treaty or in either of the enabling Acts to currency.&lt;ref&gt;Except perhaps by inference: the Treaty assigned to the Irish Free State the same status in the Empire as Canada and the latter had already [1851{{mdash}}59] [[History of the Canada dollar#1851|replaced the British Pound]] (with the Canadian Dollar).&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless and within a few years, the Dáil passed the [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1926/en/act/pub/0014/print.html Coinage Act, 1926] (which provided for a ''Saorstát'' [Free State] coinage) and the [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1927/en/act/pub/0032/print.html Currency Act, 1927] (which provided ''inter alia'' for banknotes of the [[Irish Pound#Second pound|Saorstát pound]]). The new Saorstát pound was defined by the 1927 Act to have exactly the same weight and fineness of gold as was the [[sovereign (British coin)|sovereign]] at the time, making the new currency [[Fixed exchange-rate system|pegged]] at 1:1 with sterling. The State circulated its new national coinage in 1928, marked ''Saorstát Éireann'' and a [[Series A Banknotes|national series of banknotes]]. British coinage remained  acceptable in the Free State at an equal rate. In 1937, when the Free State was superseded by Ireland (''Éire''), the pound became known as the "Irish pound" and the coins were marked ''Éire''.

==Demographics==
According to one report, in 1924, shortly after the Irish Free State's establishment, the new dominion had the "lowest birth-rate in the world". The report noted that amongst countries for which statistics were available ([[Ceylon]], Chile, Japan, Spain, South Africa, Netherlands, Canada, Germany, Australia, United States, Britain, New Zealand, Finland and the Irish Free State). Ceylon had the highest birth rate at 40.8 per 1,000 while the Irish Free State had a birth rate of just 18.6 per 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=OSWCC19240311.2.5&amp;srpos=6&amp;e=-------10--1----2%22Irish+Free+State%22-all Otautau Standard and Wallace County Chronicle, Volume XVIX, Issue 971, 11 March 1924, Page 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the Irish Free State==
In 1937 the [[Fianna Fáil]] government presented a draft of an entirely new Constitution to [[Dáil Éireann]].  An amended version of the draft document was subsequently approved by the Dáil.  A [[Irish constitutional plebiscite, 1937|referendum]] was held on  1 July 1937, the same day as the [[Irish general election, 1937|1937 general election]], when a relatively narrow majority approved it.  The new [[Constitution of Ireland]] (''Bunreacht na hÉireann'') repealed the 1922 Constitution, and came into effect on 29 December 1937.

The state was named Ireland ([[Éire]] in the [[Irish language]]), and a new office of [[President of Ireland]] was instituted in place of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State. The new constitution claimed jurisdiction over all of Ireland while recognising that legislation would not apply in Northern Ireland (see [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]]). Articles 2 and 3 were [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|reworded]] in 1998 to remove jurisdictional claim over the entire island and to recognise that "a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island".

With respect to religion, a section of Article 44 included the following:

{{quote|The State recognises the special position of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church as the guardian of the Faith professed by the great majority of the citizens. The State also recognises the [[Church of Ireland]], the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church in Ireland, the [[Religious Society of Friends]] in Ireland, as well as the [[Jew|Jewish Congregations]] and the other religious denominations existing in Ireland at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution.}} Following a referendum, this section was [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|deleted]] in 1973.

It was left to the initiative of de Valera's successors in government to achieve the country's [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|formal transformation into a republic]]. A small but significant minority of Irish people, usually attached to parties like Sinn Féin and the smaller [[Republican Sinn Féin]], denied the right of the twenty-six county state to use the name ''Ireland'' and continued to refer to the state as the Free State.  With Sinn Féin's entry into [[Dáil Éireann]] and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] at the close of the 20th century, the number of those who refuse to accept the legitimacy of the state, which was already in a minority, declined further.  After the setting up of the Free State in 1923, some Protestants left southern Ireland and unionism there largely came to an end.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3259">The '''Consiglio di Stato''' ({{lang-en|'''Council of State'''}}) is a legal-administrative consultative body that ensures the legality of [[public administration]] in [[Italy]]. The council has jurisdiction on acts of all administrative authorities, except when these authorities lack discretionary power, in which case the dispute is considered to be one of civil law.
{{Politics of Italy}}

== Authority ==
The council derives its authority and powers from several articles in the [[Constitution of Italy]].

Article 100:
:: ''The Council of State is a legal-administrative consultative body and ensures the legality of public administration.''

Article 103:
:: ''The Council of State and the other organs of judicial administration have jurisdiction for safeguarding before the public administration legitimate rights and, in particular matters laid out by law, also subjective rights.''

Article 111:
:: ''Appeals to Cassation against decisions of the Council of State and the Court of Accounts are permitted only for motives arising from judicial flaws.''

== Advise ==
The council has consultation authority in several different cases defined by statute.

# Cases in which the consultation of the Council is compulsory (statute n°127 from May 15, 1997):
## drafts of regulations to be signed by a minister or by the President of the Republic;
## drafts of legislations or regulations unifying various previous texts;
## general models for certain types of contracts, agreements and conventions established by one or several ministers ;
## administrative decisions which are bound by the advice of the Council of State in the instances provided by legislation previous to the statute n°127/1997;
## extraordinary petitions to the President of the Republic (petition in-lieu-of litigation sent by citizens to the President of the Republic as a fountain of justice, which are transmitted then to one of the administrative sections of the Council of State. The latter formulates an advice : if the competent minister feels disinclined to follow it, he has to refer the case to the cabinet which is alone may vote to disregard the council's opinion).
# Cases in which the Council may be consulted:
## bills and normative acts of the European Union;
## any question concerning the interpretation of statutes or good administration which a minister may wish to submit to the Council.

== Structure ==
The council has 111 members: the President, 18 presidents of section and 92 councillors of State:

* Four consultative sections, of which one on proposed new rules or regulations;
* Three judicial sections;
* Special (ad hoc) consultative commission;
* A consultative general assembly, composed of all the members of the Council of State;
* A plenary assembly of the judicial sections (13 members).

'''Luxembourg – United States relations''' are [[bilateral relations]] between [[Luxembourg]] and the [[United States]].

== History ==
The United States, fighting on the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] side, contributed to Luxembourg's liberation in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].  More than 5,000 American soldiers, including [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[General (United States)|General]] [[George S. Patton]], are buried at the [[Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial]] near the capital of [[Luxembourg City]], and there are monuments in many towns to American liberators. The strong U.S.–Luxembourg relationship is expressed both bilaterally and through common membership in [[NATO]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE).

According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 42% of [[Luxembourgers]] approve of U.S. leadership, with 33% disapproving and 25% uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/file/poll/161309/US_Global_Leadership_Report_03-13_mh2.pdf U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012] ''[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Montenegrin Australians''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Crnogorski Australijanci'') are [[Australian]] citizens of [[Montenegrins|Montenegrin]] descent.

There are claims that the first Montenegrin emigrants to Australia arrived in the mid-19th century. However, there is no more reliable data on this, primarily because many traveled on the way through parts of today's [[Montenegro]], which were under Austrian rule. It was only in 1884, at least according to available archival data, that 36 Montenegrins migrated "to Asian countries and Australia". Along with this, there are also data that Montenegrins, as well as many other emigrants at that time, worked in mines and deforestation in wetlands. Most were in the mining center of Broken Hill, but also in northern Queensland, where they worked on forest logging and reeds and road construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.portalanalitika.me/clanak/270277/pozdrav-od-crnogoraca-iz-australije-samo-da-se-zna-da-je-crnogorsko|title=Pozdrav od Crnogoraca iz Australije: Samo da se zna da je crnogorsko|website=PortalAnalitika.me|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Montenegrins living in Australia are concentrated in [[New South Wales]] (primarily in [[Sydney]]) and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montenegro.org.au/popis2006.html Montenegrin Ethnic Association of Australia: KOLIKO NAS IMA U AUSTRALIJI....POPIS 2007.

Woolfe was formerly channel controller of [[Sky1]] and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Sweney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/02/television-channelfive |title=Former Sky 1 and Channel 5 channel controller joins Prime Focus |publisher=Guardian |date= 2011-06-02|accessdate=2011-10-19 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[The Guardian]], "''there is no one more noisy in UK TV management than Woolfe''".&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Leigh Holmwood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/13/channelfive-bskyb |title=Richard Woolfe profile: controller set to make a big noise at Channel Five |publisher=Guardian |date= 2008-11-13|accessdate=2011-10-19 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
A self publicist, Woolfe's first major roles in the television industry were as Head of Entertainment at [[Planet 24]], Editor of Entertainment Programmes at [[Granada Television]] and Entertainment and Features Producer at the [[BBC]] and at Real Television. He also served as Controller of [[LivingTV]], [[Ftn (TV channel)|Ftn]] and [[Bravo (UK TV channel)|Bravo]].&lt;ref name="businessweek1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Woolfe |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=25472123&amp;privcapId=26356&amp;previousCapId=5531274&amp;previousTitle=Five |title=Richard Woolfe: Executive Profile &amp; Biography |publisher=BusinessWeek |date= |accessdate=2011-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

===BSkyB===

===Five===

===Credits and awards===
Whilst at [[LivingTV]], Woolfe was named "Industry player of the year" at the [[MediaGuardian]] Edinburgh International TV festival. Wrongly cited as the person who commissioned ''[[Most Haunted]]'', it was actually Arch Dyson two weeks before Woolfe took the job. Whilst at [[LivingTV]] Woolfe oversaw some failures too, Cilla with high production values and a large ad campaign the audience stayed away.

As Director of Programmes at Sky1, 2 &amp; 3, Woolfe overhauled the entire channel brand, and oversaw the acquisition and development of award-winning US dramas, including ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and ''[[Prison Break]]'', and home-grown entertainment and drama formats including ''[[Ross Kemp on Gangs]]''.  The production of Terry Pratchett's ''Hogfather'' "marked a new era of domestically produced drama for Sky, entertaining audiences of over 2.8 million and securing [[Sky1]] its first ever [[BAFTA]].  In 2008, Sky1 was named Broadcast's Best Digital Entertainment Channel under Woolfe's leadership.&lt;ref name="ukscreenassociation1"/&gt; Woolfe acquired a further [[BAFTA]] for ''[[Ross Kemp on Gangs]]''. Also at Sky, Woolfe resurrected [[Gladiators (UK TV series)]], which secured a total audience of over 1.6m for its launch show.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;

Woolfe's producer credits include: ''[[That's Life!]]'', ''[[The National Lottery Live]]'', the first £1m ''[[Survivor (UK TV series)|Survivor]]'' final, ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]] UK'', ''[[Extreme Makeover]] UK'', ''[[Gladiators (UK TV series)|Gladiators]]'' (executive producer), ''[[Don't Forget The Lyrics!]]'' (co-executive producer) and the ill-conceived ''[[Don't Stop Believing (TV series)|Don't Stop Believing]]'' (executive producer).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1484571/filmoyear&lt;/ref&gt; Richard did not survive at Channel 5 when Richard Desmond took over the channel. ''Don't Stop Believing'' became a media headline as Desmond didn't want to pay the full cost because of its failure to gain good audience figure.

==Personal life==
He married in 1988 and has a son and daughter.

"'''Road to Europe'''" (originally called "European Road Show" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20040808fox15/&lt;/ref&gt;) is the 20th episode of the [[Family Guy (season 3)|third season]] of the [[animated cartoon|animated]] [[television comedy|comedy series]] ''[[Family Guy]]''. It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on February&amp;nbsp;7,&amp;nbsp;2002. The episode follows baby [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], who becomes obsessed with the fictional British [[children's television series]] "Jolly Farm Revue". He decides to run away from home to become part of the cast and his [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] decides to chase him down in an attempt to bring him back home. Meanwhile, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] go to a [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] [[concert]], where Lois reveals she knows nothing about the band, much to Peter's embarrassment.

"Road to Europe" was written by [[Daniel Palladino]] and directed by [[Dan Povenmire]]. It received mostly positive reviews from critics for its storyline and its many cultural references. The episode featured Kiss members [[Gene Simmons]] and [[Paul Stanley]]. It also featured guest voices by comedian [[Andy Dick]], actor and director [[Jon Favreau]], actor [[Sean Flynn (actor)|Sean Flynn]], actress and singer [[Lauren Graham]], actress [[Michelle Horn]], and voice actor [[Wally Wingert]].

==Plot summary==
[[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] is obsessed with a British television program called ''Jolly Farm Revue'', a colorful children's TV show featuring several imaginary characters. Questioning his future in [[Quahog, Rhode Island|Quahog]], Stewie decides to travel to "Jolly Farm" in the UK and live there forever. Desperate, he goes to the local airport and sneaks aboard a [[transatlantic flight]], intending to travel to [[London]], and to find the [[BBC]] studios where Jolly Farm Revue is filmed. [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] tries to stop Stewie from leaving [[Rhode Island]], and follows him onboard the plane. When he finally finds Stewie, the plane takes off and lands in the [[Middle East]].

Brian begins to search for a way to get back to the United States, but Stewie refuses to leave with him and insists they travel to London. Brian and Stewie search for a camel to use as transportation, and they perform a musical number as a diversion in order to steal one. They begin their journey, but the camel dies in the middle of the desert. They soon find a nearby [[Comfort Inn]], however, in which to stay. They steal a [[hot air balloon]] from the hotel premises and make their way to the [[Vatican City]], embarrassing the [[Pope]] upon landing, then traveling by train from [[Switzerland]] to [[Munich]], and end up in [[Amsterdam]]. Upon finally arriving at the [[BBC Television Centre]], Stewie is horrified to learn that the farm is a set, and his beloved characters are merely tired out, disinterested actors. Enraged, Stewie decides to travel back home with Brian to Quahog after getting revenge at the Mother Maggie actress for kicking him by defecating in her shoes. This ordeal also causes Stewie to lose interest in the show.

Meanwhile, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] is overjoyed to hear about [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]-stock, a five-night set of concerts in [[New England]] by his favorite band, Kiss. He and his wife, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], dress in face paint and [[leather]] just like the band members in Kiss, as does the rest of the crowd, and they manage to stand in the front row. When [[Gene Simmons]] points the microphone at Lois, prompting her to sing the next line in the chorus of "[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]," Peter is ashamed to discover that she doesn't know the lyrics. Deeply saddened by this, Gene and [[Paul Stanley]] leave the stage, leaving [[Ace Frehley]] and [[Peter Criss]] to perform "[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]" to cheer up the displeased audience.

After the concert, Peter accuses Lois of only [[poseur|pretending to be a Kiss enthusiast]], and they leave the concert venue in disgrace. Later that night, Peter and Lois stop at a [[Denny's]] on the way home from the concert. The Kiss members are seated at another table, and Lois recognizes Gene without his "Demon" make-up as Chaim Witz (Gene's birth name), an old friend. Peter is amazed to discover that Lois or "Loose Lois" had dated Gene when they were in high school. Peter's faith in Lois is then restored, and he proudly shares the news on [[public-access television]] that "my wife did Kiss."&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

"Road to Europe" is the second episode of the "[[Road to...

In addition to the regular cast, the episode featured guest appearances by comedian [[Andy Dick]], actor and director [[Jon Favreau]], actor [[Sean Flynn (actor)|Sean Flynn]], actress and singer [[Lauren Graham]], actress [[Michelle Horn]] and voice actor [[Wally Wingert]]. It also guest starred [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] members [[Gene Simmons]]

==Cultural references==
"Road to Europe" features several cultural references. Brian compares Stewie's look with [[Charlie Brown]]; Stewie responds by comparing him with Charlie Brown's dog [[Snoopy]]; both these characters are from the [[comic strip]] ''[[Peanuts]]''.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|title=Family Guy: The Official Episode Guide, Seasons 1–3|author=Callaghan, Steve|isbn=0-06-083305-X|chapter=Road to Europe|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=[[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]|year=2005|page=204|authorlink=Steve Callaghan}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Kiss concert, the song that the band plays, and the one that Lois does not know the lyrics to, is the single "[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]".&lt;ref name=book/&gt; In the song Stewie and Brian sing, the [[Marquis de Sade]], singer [[Ricky Martin]] and actress [[Phylicia Rashad]] are mentioned. Brian also uses [[Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog]]'s catch phrase, "For me to poop on" to insult Stewie.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

While riding a tour bus in [[Germany]], Brian looks at a history book that has no information regarding German history from&amp;nbsp;1939 – 1945; the years on which [[World War II]] started and ended. Brian questions the tour guide about the dates when Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded]] [[Poland]], but the guide [[Holocaust denial|denies that it happened]]. Brian keeps insisting until the guide yells "Sie werden sich hinsetzen! Sie werden ruhig sein! Sie werden nicht beleidigen Deutschland!", literally meaning "You will sit down! You will be quiet! You will not insult Germany!" while making the [[Nazi salute]] with his left hand.&lt;ref name=book/&gt; The last sentence is grammatically incorrect, as the proper German statement would be, "Sie werden Deutschland nicht beleidigen!"  At the beginning of the episode, the credits are presented with title cards containing images of Brian and Stewie passing by various iconic places in [[Europe]]. These include [[France]]'s [[Eiffel Tower]], [[Italy]]'s [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] and a [[Venice|venetian]] [[gondola]], the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Stonehenge]] and [[Greece]]'s [[Parthenon]].&lt;ref name=book/&gt; Other iconic items shown include the [[Union Flag]] and the [[Pope]].&lt;ref name=ING/&gt;

==Reception==
{{Quote box|width=25em|quote="Brian and Stewie once again reunite for a memorable duet titled, "You and I Are So Awfully Different." If that's not enough, Stewie and Brian also manage to offend the Pope on their way to the Jolly Farm Revue set. While not as exciting as some of their other adventures, the musical number alone makes this episode worthy as one of Stewie and Brian's best adventures."|align=right|source=Ahsan Haque, IGN.&lt;ref name=ING/&gt;}}
Reviews of the episode by television critics were mostly positive. Critic Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]] placed "Road to Europe" in the top ten of Stewie and Brian's Greatest Adventures, ranking it fifth. Haque noted that the episode is not as entertaining as many of the other Stewie and Brian adventures, but the song included in the episode, "You and I Are So Awfully Different" made it worthy of an appearance on the list.&lt;ref name=ING&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Haque, Ahsan|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/105/1057773p1.html|title= Family Guy: Stewie and Brian's Greatest Adventures |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Road to Europe" is the lowest ranked Road to&amp;nbsp;... episode on the list with "[[Road to Germany]]" at number four, "[[Road to Rupert]]" at number three, "[[Road to the Multiverse]]" at number two and "[[Road to Rhode Island]]" ranked as the best.&lt;ref name=ING/&gt; Television critic Ramsey Isler, also of IGN, commented positively about the episode in his review of the eighth season episode "[[Go Stewie, Go]]," which contained an American version of ''Jolly Farm Revue''. Isler went on to note, "for the most part the Jolly Farm concept is much less interesting than it was in the much more amusing and classic ''Family Guy'' episode, 'Road to Europe.'"&lt;ref name="ignreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/107/1077503p1.html |title=Family Guy: "Go Stewie Go" Review |publisher=IGN |author=Isler, Ramsey |date=2010-03-15 |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shiro''' is a homogeneous [[stew]] whose primary ingredient is powdered [[chickpeas]] or [[broad bean]] meal. It is often prepared with the addition of minced [[onion]]s, [[garlic]] and, depending upon regional variation, ground [[ginger]] or chopped tomatoes and chili-peppers. Shiro is served atop [[injera]] (leavened flat bread) or (unleavened flat bread). Tegabino shiro is a type of shiro made from heavily spiced legume, chickpea, field pea, or fava bean, oil (or butter), and water. It is brought bubbling to the table in a miniature [[Pottery|clay pot]] or shallow aluminum pan. Its true aficionados usually consume it with a dark or sergegna injera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stirring the Pot: A History of African Cuisine|last=McCann|first=James C.|publisher=Ohio University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780896804647|location=|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it can be cooked and added to shredded injera or taita and eaten with a spoon; this version is called ''shiro [[fit-fit]]''.

Shiro is an essential part of Eritrean cuisine and [[Cuisine of Ethiopia]]. It is a favorite dish during special occasions, including [[Tsom]], [[Ramadan]] and other fasting seasons.

It is a [[vegan food]], but there are non-vegan variations including [[niter kibbeh]] (a spiced, clarified butter) or meat (in which case it is called ''bozena shiro'').

The '''Taurisci''' were a federation of [[Gauls|Gallic]] tribes who dwelt in today's northern [[Slovenia]] ([[Carniola]]) before the coming of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (c. 200 BC)&lt;ref name="ce-krain"&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Krain}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pliny the Elder]], they are the same people known as the '''Norici'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], [[Naturalis Historia]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Researches Into the Physical History of Mankind | author = [[James Cowles Prichard]] | page = 92 | publisher = [[Houlston &amp; Stoneman]] | year = 1841 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The denotation probably stems from a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word meaning "hill" or "high rock", as in [[Tauern]] and [[Tor (rock formation)|tor]], and therefore may also refer to highlanders in general.

Affiliated with the Celto-Ligurian [[Taurini]], the Taurisci settled on the upper [[Sava]] river after their defeat at the [[Battle of Telamon]] in 225 BC. Following in the wake of the [[Boii]], they migrated to northern [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italia]] and the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast. The Greek chronicler [[Polybius]] (ca. 203–120 BC) mentioned Tauriscian [[gold mining]] in the area of [[Aquileia]]. Along with the troops of the [[Roman Republic]], they were defeated by invading Germanic [[Cimbri]] and [[Teutons]] at the [[Battle of Noreia]] in 112 BC.

The identity of Taurisci and Norici has not yet been conclusively established: According to the historian [[Géza Alföldy]], the Norici were one tribe of the larger highlandic Taurisci federation, while the ''[[Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde]]'' defines the Norici as Celts settling in the ''Regnum [[Noricum]]'' in present-day [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], with the Taurisci as their southeastern neighbours. Other people settling in the region were the [[Pannonians]] in the south-east of Carniola, the [[Iapydes]], an [[Illyria]]n tribe, in the south-west, and the [[Carni]], a [[Adriatic Veneti|Veneti]]c tribe.

[[Teurisci]], [[Geography (Ptolemy)|attested]] by [[Ptolemy]] in [[Dacia]], were originally  a group of the Celtic Taurisci from the Austrian Alps established in North-Western Dacia at the end of Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;Parvan V, Vulpe R, Vulpe A (2002) ''Dacia'' Publisher: Editura 100+1 Gramar, page 165 established&lt;/ref&gt;
