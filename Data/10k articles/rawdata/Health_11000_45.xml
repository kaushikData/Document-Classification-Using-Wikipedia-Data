==History==
From 21 July 1940, Latvia was known as the [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and followed the abortion laws of the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR). On 27 June 1936, the USSR banned abortions unless there was a danger to the life of the mother or the child would inherit a serious disease from the parents. Under this law, abortions were meant to be performed in maternity homes and hospitals, and physicians who disregarded this risked one to two years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="United Nations"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/latvia.doc|title=Abortion in Latvia (Word Document)|publisher=United Nations|date=|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 November 1955, the [[Government of the Soviet Union]] issued a decree which allowed abortions to be available on request. Later that year, abortion was restricted so that it could only be performed in the first three months of pregnancy, unless the birth would endanger the mother. Physicians had to perform abortions in hospitals, and unless the mother was in danger, a fee was charged.&lt;ref name="United Nations"/&gt; If the abortion was not performed in a hospital, the physician would be imprisoned for one year. If the person who performed the abortion did not have a medical degree, then they would be imprisoned for two years. If serious injuries or death were caused to a pregnant woman, there would be up to eight years of imprisonment.&lt;ref name="United Nations"/&gt;

The Government of the USSR was concerned about the rate of illegal abortions, and attempted to decrease their occurrence. On 31 December 1987, the Soviet Union announced that it would permit many medical institutions to perform abortions until the twenty-eighth week of pregnancy. Abortions occurred more frequently and in 1996, 44.1 abortions per 1,000 births occurred in Latvia.&lt;ref name="United Nations"/&gt;

The Fertility and Family Survey in 1995 found that 30% of women at age 25 had had an abortion.&lt;ref name="United Nations"/&gt; Due to the high abortion rate, [[Government of Latvia|Latvia's government]] is encouraging more births.&lt;ref name="LRCT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.life.org.nz/abortion/pagefeature2/36-latvia|title=Latvian and Lithuania|publisher=The Life Resources Charitable Trust|year=1995|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, an abortion can be performed without request up to the twelfth week of pregnancy, and can be requested up to the twenty-eighth.&lt;ref name="Europe's abortion laws"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LRCT"/&gt;

A campaign named "For Life" ("Par dzīvību" in [[Latvian language|Latvian]]) has been set up to reduce the number of abortions in Latvia. In 1991, there were 34,633 births and 44,886 abortions, but this number has been falling since 1999. In 2011, around 7,000 abortions were performed.&lt;ref name="Baltic Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/32082/|title=Baby statues tell a sad story|publisher=Baltic Times|date=31 October 2012|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2010}}, the abortion rate was 15.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 years.&lt;ref name="un2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = World Abortion Policies 2013 | publisher = United Nations | year = 2013 | url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml | accessdate = 3 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aisha Abubakar Abdulwahab was born in c.1971 and she joined the Nigerian police force in 1995. She has a degree in veterinary science and a doctorate.&lt;ref name=bag/&gt;

In 2005 she won a [[UNESCO]] fellow award for her proposal to use [[DNA]] to identify the link between human and [[bovine tuberculosis]]. By taking samples from cows and people she could evaluate the risk that Nigerians made when they drank [[unpasteurized milk]].&lt;ref name=award&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=25846&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Science needs women], UNESCO.org, Retrieved 9 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The award was to enable her to complete the research at any university. Adbulwahab was married with two children.&lt;ref name=bag&gt;[http://nm.onlinenigeria.com/templates/?a=3490&amp;z=12 Female cop bags UNESCO award], 2005, OnlineNigeria, Retrieved 8 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alcoholic cardiomyopathy''' is a disease in which the chronic long-term abuse of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] (i.e., [[ethanol]]) leads to [[heart failure]].&lt;ref name="pmid12006456"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Piano MR |title=Alcoholic cardiomyopathy: incidence, clinical characteristics, and pathophysiology |journal=Chest |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=1638–50 |date=May 2002 |pmid=12006456 |doi=10.1378/chest.121.5.1638 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12006456 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130414121336/http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12006456 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is a type of [[dilated cardiomyopathy]]. Due to the direct toxic effects of alcohol on heart muscle, the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, leading to heart failure. It can affect other parts of the body if the heart failure is severe. It is most common in males between the ages of 35–50.

==Signs and symptoms==

Signs and symptoms presented by the occurrence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy are the result of the heart failing and usually occur after the disease has progressed to an advanced stage. Therefore, the symptoms have a lot in common with other forms of [[cardiomyopathy]]. These symptoms can include the following:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drugs.com/enc/alcoholic-cardiomyopathy.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Ankle, feet, and leg swelling ([[edema]])
*Overall swelling
*[[Anorexia (symptom)|Loss of appetite]]
*Shortness of breath ([[Shortness of breath|dyspnea]]), especially with activity
*Breathing difficulty while lying down
*Fatigue, weakness, faintness
*Decreased alertness or concentration
*Cough containing mucus, or pink, frothy material
*Decreased urine output ([[oliguria]])
*Need to urinate at night ([[nocturia]])
*[[Heart palpitations]] (irregular heart beat) 
*Rapid pulse ([[tachycardia]])

==Diagnosis==
Abnormal heart sounds, murmurs, [[ECG]] abnormalities, and enlarged heart on chest x-ray may lead to the diagnosis. [[Echocardiogram]] abnormalities and [[cardiac catheterization]] or [[angiogram]] to rule out coronary artery blockages, along with a history of alcohol abuse can confirm the diagnosis.

==Treatment==

Treatment for alcoholic cardiomyopathy involves lifestyle changes, including complete abstinence from alcohol use, a low sodium diet,  and fluid restriction, as well as medications.  Medications may include [[ACE inhibitors]], [[beta blockers]], and [[diuretics]] which are commonly used in other forms of cardiomyopathy to reduce the strain on the heart. Persons with congestive heart failure may be considered for surgical insertion of an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator|ICD]] or a [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]] which can improve heart function. In cases where the heart failure is irreversible and worsening, [[heart transplant]] may be considered.

Treatment will possibly prevent the heart from further deterioration, and the cardiomyopathy is largely reversible if complete abstinence from alcohol is maintained.

The Society was founded in 1947 for “the relief of suffering and distress amongst the aged and infirm by the improvement of standards of medical care for such persons, the holding of meetings and the publication and distribution of the results of such research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BGS History|url=http://www.bgs.org.uk/index.php/home/mnubgsrole|access-date=2013-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215147/http://www.bgs.org.uk/index.php/home/mnubgsrole#|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;”.

The BGS achieves these purposes by holding scientific meetings, producing clinical guidance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BGS Guides|url=http://www.bgs.org.uk/index.php/topresources/publicationfind|access-date=2013-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019165435/http://www.bgs.org.uk/index.php/topresources/publicationfind#|archive-date=2013-10-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sharing best practice and acting as an ‘expert voice’ on the care of older people and promoting better health in older age. Members lead several national clinical audits in collaboration with other professional bodies such as Royal Colleges, and specialist clinical associations organizations. 

==Journal==

''[[Age and Ageing]]'', which is published by [[Oxford University Press]], is the official journal of the British Geriatrics Society, publishing refereed original articles and commissioned reviews on geriatric medicine and gerontology. Its range includes research on ageing and the clinical, epidemiological and psychological aspects of later life. Its impact factor of 3.816 is among the highest in the field of clinical ageing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6201">The passing of the [[Cancer Act 1939]] marked the political significance of cancer treatment.  It envisaged a system of co-ordination of diagnosis and treatment under the control of County Councils and County Borough Councils which preceded the establishment of the NHS.  The outbreak of war prevented most of its provisions from coming into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webster|first1=Charles|title=The Health Services Since the War|date=1988|publisher=HMSO|location=London|isbn=0116309423|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
There were 361,216 cancer diagnoses in 2014 in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cancer Is More Common Than Marriage Or Having A First Baby In The UK|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/cancer-more-common-marriage-or-having-first-baby-uk-2563566|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=International Business Times|date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Cancer Research UK]] publishes detailed statistics of the incidence of and mortality from cancer in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cancer Statistics for the UK|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics|website=Cancer Research UK|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three quarters of cancers were related to smoking and drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revealed for the first time: the cancer map of Britain|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3320727/Revealed-for-the-first-time-the-cancer-map-of-Britain.html|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=11 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment of [[cancer]] has been a recurring issue in the [[National Health Service]]. Official guidelines state that no one in England should have to wait more than 62 days for cancer treatment after a referral from their general practitioner.  However, press reports in 2015 indicated that some patients had to wait longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/510685/Hospitals-miss-cancer-targets | title=NHS failing cancer patients with life-threatening delays | accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/20/more-nhs-hospitals-breach-waiting-times-for-cancer-treatment | title=More NHS hospitals breach waiting times for cancer treatment | accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 September 2015, the NHS announced it would no longer pay for 17 different cancer medications. The Telegraph reported that over 5,000 patients with breast, bowel, skin, and pancreatic cancers would be affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/11844314/Thousands-of-cancer-patients-to-be-denied-treatment.html | title=Thousands of cancer patients to be denied treatment | accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A five-year Cancer Strategy Implementation Plan was published by NHS England in 2015.  It promises considerable investment in [[linear accelerator]]s There have been some improvements in cancer care but too many patients are waiting too long for diagnosis and treatment. Sir [[Harpal Kumar]] criticised the government's child obesity strategy. He said the report was not tough enough on the food industry, given the number of cancers which are linked to lifestyle.  The increased investment does not appear to be sufficient to meet the rise in the number of cancer patients, and there are shortages of [[radiologist]]s, specialist nurses and other key staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37719471|title=Cancer care: Is world class status a distant dream?|first=Nick|last=Triggle|date=25 October 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Targets===
National cancer waiting times standards were established by [[NHS England]] in 2009 (and the same targets have been set by [[NHS Scotland]]).
In 2017 the targets are
* No more than 62 days wait between the date the hospital receives an urgent GP referral for suspected cancer and starting treatment
* Starting treatment no more than 31 days after the meeting at which you and your doctor agree the treatment plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Waiting times for tests and treatment after cancer diagnosis|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/cancer-questions/waiting-times-for-tests-and-treatment-after-cancer-diagnosis#treat|accessdate=10 March 2017|publisher=Cancer research UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The targets are monitored monthly and in the period from 2014 to 2016 were only met in 4 months out of 36.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS misses cancer wait time targets for nearly three years|url=http://healthcareleadernews.com/article/nhs-misses-cancer-wait-time-targets-nearly-three-years|accessdate=10 March 2017|publisher=Healthcare Leader|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sara Hiom of [[Cancer Research UK]] said, ‘The state of NHS diagnostic services is deeply concerning – and new GP referral guidelines from NICE mean that even more patients will be waiting for these tests. There aren’t enough trained staff, they’re often reliant on outdated equipment and in many cases they’re already operating services seven days a week.'  Dr Giles Maskell of the [[Royal College of Radiologists]] said, ‘Well-resourced testing services are crucial to the early diagnosis of cancer, which in turn is vital to increase survival from the disease.'  Cancer Research UK is calling on the government to provide funding for earlier diagnosis of cancer as prompt diagnosis increases the chances the patient will survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentnurse.co.uk/news/nhs-cancer-services-underfunded-and-understaffed/89134  NHS cancer services ‘underfunded and understaffed’]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative treatments===
Many physicians in the United Kingdom are at least tolerant of alternative treatments and some might recommend them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative/about/the-difference-between-complementary-and-alternative-therapies "The difference between complementary and alternative therapies"], [[Cancer Research UK]], accessed 20 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2595">'''[[Capital punishment]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]''' was abolished ''de-facto'' for all crimes in November 1998 in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (last execution though to be carried there out in 1977 for murder) and on {{Dts|2000-06-21}} in the [[Republika Srpska]]. The death penalty still remains present in statutes, specifically in Article 11 of Republika Srpska, but the current constitution forbids it from being carried out.

The '''Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium''' ('''CDISC''') is an open, multidisciplinary, neutral, [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3)]] non-profit [[Standard-developing organization|standards developing organization (SDO)]] that has been working through productive, consensus-based collaborative teams, since its formation in 1997, to develop global standards and innovations to streamline medical research and ensure a link with healthcare. The CDISC mission is "to develop and support global, platform-independent data standards that enable information system interoperability to improve medical research and related areas of healthcare". The CDISC Vision is "informing patient care and safety through higher quality medical research". The CDISC suite of standards supports medical research of any type from protocol through analysis and reporting of results. They have been shown to decrease resources needed by 60% overall and 70–90% in the start-up stages when they are implemented at the beginning of the research process.&lt;ref name="r3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrea Vadakin: CDISC standards and innovations, 2012|url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/cont/40sup31/p217-28eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are harmonized through a model that is now not only a CDISC standard but also an [[HL7]] standard on the path to becoming an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] standard, thus giving the CDISC standards (harmonized together through BRIDG) international status and accreditation.

==Overview of standards==
* Dataset.XML ([[DataSet-XML]])
** Enables communication of study results as well as regulatory submission to FDA (pilot since 2014).&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dataset|url=http://www.cdisc.org/dataset-xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Study Data Tabulation Model ([[SDTM]])
** Recommended for FDA regulatory submissions since 2004.
** The SDTM Implementation Guide (SDTM-IG) gives a standardized, predefined collection of domains for clinical data submission, each of which is based on the structure and metadata defined by the SDTM.
* [[Standard for Exchange of Non-clinical Data (SEND)]]
** The SEND Implementation Guide (SEND-IG) provides predefined domains and examples of non-clinical (animal) data based on the structure and metadata define by the SDTM.
* Analysis Data Model (ADaM)
** Defines dataset and metadata standards that support statistical analyses and traceability. ADaM is one of the required standards for data submission to FDA (U.S.) and PMDA (Japan).
* Operational Data Model (ODM)
** The highlights of ODM: includes audit trail, utilizes XML technology, machine- and human- readable, all information are independent from databases, storing of ODM is independent from hard- and software.
* Laboratory Data Model (LAB)
** The Lab standard is used for exchange of laboratory data between labs and CROs
* Case Report Tabulation [[Data definition specification|Data Definition Specification]] (CRT-DDS)
** Also referred to as "[[define.xml]]", a machine readable version of the regulatory submission "define.pdf".
* Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization ([[CDASH]])
** Defines a minimal data collection set for sixteen safety SDTM Domains, harmonizing element names, definitions and metadata. The objective is to establish a standardized data collection baseline across all submissions.
* CDISC Terminology
** Defines controlled terminology for SDTM and CDASH, provides extensible lists of controlled terms designed to harmonize data collected across submissions.

==Individual standards==

===Operational Data Model (ODM)===
The [[CDISC Operational Data Model]] (ODM) is designed to facilitate the regulatory-compliant acquisition, archive and interchange of metadata and data for clinical research studies.  ODM is a vendor-neutral, platform-independent format for interchange and archive of clinical study data. The model includes the clinical data along with its associated metadata, administrative data, reference data and audit information.&lt;ref name="pm"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=26188274|pmc=4714951|year=2015|author1=Huser|first1=V|title=Standardizing data exchange for clinical research protocols and case report forms: An assessment of the suitability of the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Operational Data Model (ODM)|journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics|volume=57|pages=88–99|last2=Sastry|first2=C|last3=Breymaier|first3=M|last4=Idriss|first4=A|last5=Cimino|first5=J. J.|doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2015.06.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
ODM was first introduced in 1999, and the latest version, 1.3.2, was released in 2012.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{cite web|title=ODM|url=http://www.cdisc.org/odm}}&lt;/ref&gt; ODM extensions have been developed to create a number of additional CDISC standards, including Define-XML, Dataset-XML, SDM-XML, and CTR-XML and future planned standard Protocol-XML.

ODM is an XML based standard and it is an XML schema that provides number of constructs for modeling electronic Case Report Forms (CRFs). ODM is often combined with Study Data Model standard to more fully model trial arms or trial activities. ODM is also used in sending forms data from a clinical trial system to an [[electronic health record]] (EHR) system.

===Define-XML===
Define-XML supports the interchange of dataset metadata for clinical research applications in a machine-readable format. An important use case for Define-XML is to support the submission of clinical trials data in CDISC SDTM, SEND or ADaM format to regulatory authorities. The key metadata components to support submissions are:
* Dataset definition
* Dataset variable definitions
* Controlled Terminology definitions
* Value list definitions
* Links to supporting documents
* Computational method definitions
* Comments definitions

Define-XML can also be used to describe proprietary, non-CDISC dataset structures. The Define-XML model is implemented using extensions to the CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM) XML schema. The current version is 2.0 published on the CDISC web site.

===CTR-XML===
Clinical Trial Representation allows representing basic characterstic of a clinical trial, such as study sponsor, study name, size of the trial (number of participants). The standard was first introduced in 2016.

==BRIDG==

[[CDISC BRIDG model]] is a unifying model of the domain of clinical research and research studies. It defines basic elements such as investigator, subject, study, intervention. It is used to keep all standards consistent. It was first introduced in 2006 with version 2 released in 2008. It can be obtained as UML model as well as .OWL format.

==SHARE==

CDISC SHARE (Shared Health and Clinical Research Electronic Library) is a metadata repository that supports the development, governance, publishing, and consumption of CDISC standards in human and machine-readable formats. SHARE helps users find, understand, and use rich metadata (i.e., research concepts, data elements and attributes, relationship among data elements, properties in relationship, and controlled terminologies) relevant to clinical studies more efficiently and consistently. With all these information in a single repository, SHARE will improve integration and traceability of clinical data end-to-end, from protocol through analysis. SHARE will provide a collaborative standards development environment that will improve quality, integration, and consistency across CDISC standards.

==CDISC-registered solutions providers==
CDISC maintains a list of solutions providers, subject matter experts and consultants deemed to have sufficient knowledge and experience implementing the various CDISC standards.

==ODM and EDC integration==
[[Electronic data capture]] (EDC) systems can be certified as compliant with the Operational Data Model (ODM) by CDISC. There are two main types of integration, ODM Import and ODM Export.

===ODM import===
Full import allows importing of ODM-formatted clinical data (MetaData and Data).
MetaData only import allows only the importing of MetaData. This is useful for setting up the EDC system to capture data. Basically allows third party software to define the forms, variables etc. used in the EDC system. This provides an EDC vendor-neutral system for defining a study.

===ODM export===
The EDC system will generate ODM data files for further processing. For example, REDCap data capture system allows export of a study in ODM.&lt;ref name="redcap"&gt;{{cite web|last1=REDCap|title=REDCap ODM support|url=https://projectredcap.org/cdisc.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''clinical decision support system''' ('''CDSS''') is a [[health information technology]] system that is designed to provide [[physician]]s and other health professionals with '''clinical decision support''' ('''CDS'''), that is, assistance with clinical [[decision-making]] tasks. A working definition has been proposed by Robert Hayward of the Centre for Health Evidence: "Clinical decision support systems link health observations with health knowledge to influence health choices by clinicians for improved health care".{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} CDSSs constitute a major topic in [[artificial intelligence in medicine]].

==Effectiveness==
The evidence of the effectiveness of CDSS is mixed. A 2014 systematic review did not find a benefit in terms of risk of death when the CDSS was combined with the [[electronic health record]].&lt;ref name=Moja2014/&gt; There may be some benefits, however, in terms of other outcomes.&lt;ref name=Moja2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moja|first1=L|last2=Kwag|first2=KH|last3=Lytras|first3=T|last4=Bertizzolo|first4=L|last5=Brandt|first5=L|last6=Pecoraro|first6=V|last7=Rigon|first7=G|last8=Vaona|first8=A|last9=Ruggiero|first9=F|last10=Mangia|first10=M|last11=Iorio|first11=A|last12=Kunnamo|first12=I|last13=Bonovas|first13=S|title=Effectiveness of computerized decision support systems linked to electronic health records: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=December 2014|volume=104|issue=12|pages=e12–22|pmid=25322302|doi=10.2105/ajph.2014.302164|pmc=4232126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 [[systematic review]] concluded that CDSSs improved practitioner performance in 64% of the studies. The CDSSs improved patient outcomes in 13% of the studies. Sustainable CDSSs features associated with improved practitioner performance include the following:
* automatic electronic prompts rather than requiring user activation of the system
Both the number and the methodological quality of studies of CDSSs increased from 1973 through 2004.&lt;ref name="pmid15755945"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Garg AX, Adhikari NK, McDonald H, Rosas-Arellano MP, Devereaux PJ, Beyene J | title=Effects of computerized clinical decision support systems on practitioner performance and patient outcomes: a systematic review. | journal=JAMA | year= 2005 | volume= 293 | issue= 10 | pages= 1223–38 | pmid=15755945| url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=clinical.uthscsa.edu/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=15755945 | doi=10.1001/jama.293.10.1223 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another 2005 systematic review found... ''"Decision support systems significantly improved clinical practice in 68% of trials."'' The CDSS features associated with success include the following:&lt;ref name="PMID 15767266"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Kensaku Kawamoto |author2=Caitlin A Houlihan |author3=E Andrew Balas |author4=David F Lobach. | title=Improving clinical practice using clinical decision support systems: a systematic review of trials to identify features critical to success. | journal=BMJ | year= 2005| url=http://www.bmj.com/content/330/7494/765.full.pdf+html | doi=10.1136/bmj.38398.500764.8F | pmid=15767266 | pmc=555881 | volume=330 | issue=7494 | pages=765}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the CDSS is integrated into the clinical workflow rather than as a separate log-in or screen.
* the CDSS is electronic rather than paper-based templates.
* the CDSS provides decision support at the time and location of care rather than prior to or after the patient encounter.
* the CDSS provides recommendations for care, not just assessments.

However, other systematic reviews are less optimistic about the effects of CDS, with one from 2011 stating ''"There is a large gap between the postulated and empirically demonstrated benefits of [CDSS and other] eHealth technologies ... their cost-effectiveness has yet to be demonstrated"''.&lt;ref name="pmid1000387"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Black |first1=A.D. |last2=Car |first2=J. |last3=Pagliari |first3=C. |last4=Anandan |first4=C. |last5=Cresswell |first5=K. |last6=Bokun |first6=T. |last7=McKinstry |first7=B. |last8=Procter |first8=R. |last9=Majeed |first9=A. |last10=Sheikh |first10=A.| title=The impact of ehealth on the quality and safety of health care: A systematic overview | journal=PLoS Medicine | date= 18 January 2011 | volume= 8 | issue= 1 | url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000387 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000387 |pmid=21267058 | pages=e1000387}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 5-year evaluation of the effectiveness of a CDSS in implementing rational treatment of bacterial infections was published in 2014; according to the authors, it was the first long term study of a CDSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nachtigall |first1=I |last2=Tafelski |first2=S |last3=Deja |first3=M |last4=Halle |first4=E |last5=Grebe |first5=M C |last6=Tamarkin |first6=A |last7=Rothbart |first7=A |last8=Unrig |first8=A |last9=Meyer |first9=E |last10=Musial-Bright |first10= L |last11=Wernecke |first11=K D |last12=Spies|first12=C |title=Long-term effect of computer-assisted decision support for antibiotic treatment in critically ill patients: a prospective 'before/after' cohort study |journal=BMJ Open |date=22 December 2014 |volume=4 |issue=12 |pages=e005370 |url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/12/e005370.full |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005370|pmid=25534209 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
A clinical decision support system has been defined as an "active [[knowledge systems]], which use two or more items of patient data to generate case-specific advice."&lt;ref name="Open Clinical DSS"&gt;"Decision support systems ." 26 July 2005. 17 Feb. 2009 &lt;http://www.openclinical.org/dss.html&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that a CDSS is simply a [[decision support system]] that is focused on using [[knowledge management]] in such a way so as  to achieve clinical advice for patient care based on multiple items of patient data.

===Purpose===
The main purpose of modern CDSS is to assist clinicians at the point of care.&lt;ref name="Berner"&gt;Berner, Eta S., ed. Clinical Decision Support Systems. New York, NY: Springer, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that clinicians interact with a CDSS to help to analyse, and reach a [[diagnosis (medical)|diagnosis]] based on, patient data.

In the early days, CDSSs were conceived of as being used to literally make decisions for the clinician. The clinician would input the information and wait for the CDSS to output the "right" choice and the clinician would simply act on that output. However, the modern methodology of using CDSSs to assist means that the clinician interacts with the CDSS, utilizing both their own knowledge and the CDSS, to make a better analysis of the patient's data than either human or CDSS could make on their own. Typically, a CDSS makes suggestions for the clinician to look through, and the clinician is expected to pick out useful information from the presented results and discount erroneous CDSS suggestions.&lt;ref name="Open Clinical DSS" /&gt;

There are two main types of CDSS:&lt;ref name="Berner"/&gt;
*Knowledge-based
*Non-knowledge-based
as detailed below.

An example of how a clinical decision support system might be used by a clinician is a specific type of CDSS, a DDSS (diagnosis decision support systems). A DDSS requests some of the patients data and in response, proposes a set of appropriate diagnoses. The doctor then takes the output of the DDSS and determines which diagnoses might be relevant and which are not,&lt;ref name="Berner" /&gt; and if necessary orders further tests to narrow down the diagnosis.

Another example of a CDSS would be a [[case-based reasoning]] (CBR) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Begum |first1=Shahina |last2=Ahmed |first2=Mobyen Uddin |last3=Funk |first3=Peter |last4=Xiong |first4=Ning |last5=Folke |first5=Mia |date=July 2011 |title=Case-based reasoning systems in the health sciences: a survey of recent trends and developments |journal=IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews) |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=421–434 |doi=10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2071862}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CBR system might use previous case data to help determine the appropriate amount of beams and the optimal beam angles for use in [[radiotherapy]] for brain cancer patients; medical physicists and oncologists would then review the recommended treatment plan to determine its viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khussainova |first1=Gulmira |last2=Petrovic |first2=Sanja |last3=Jagannathan |first3=Rupa |date=2015 |title=Retrieval with clustering in a case-based reasoning system for radiotherapy treatment planning |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |volume=616 |issue=1 |pages=012013 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/616/1/012013 |url=http://stacks.iop.org/1742-6596/616/i=1/a=012013 |issn=1742-6596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important classification of a CDSS is based on the timing of its use. Doctors use these systems at point of care to help them as they are dealing with a patient, with the timing of use being either pre-diagnosis, during diagnosis, or post diagnosis.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Pre-diagnosis CDSS systems are used to help the physician prepare the diagnoses. CDSS used during diagnosis help review and filter the physician's preliminary diagnostic choices to improve their final results. Post-diagnosis CDSS systems are used to mine data to derive connections between patients and their past medical history and clinical research to predict future events.&lt;ref name="Berner" /&gt; It has been claimed that decision support will begin to replace clinicians in common tasks in the future.&lt;ref name="Khosla"&gt;{{cite news|last=Khosla|first=Vinod|title=Technology will replace 80% of what doctors do|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/12/04/technology-doctors-khosla/|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=4 December 2012|work=CNN|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328173118/http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/12/04/technology-doctors-khosla/|archivedate=28 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach, used by the [[National Health Service]] in England, is to use a DDSS (either, in the past, operated by the patient, or, today, by a phone operative who is not medically-trained) to [[triage]] medical conditions out of hours by suggesting a suitable next step to the patient (e.g. call an [[ambulance]], or see a [[General Practitioner|general practitioner]] on the next working day). The suggestion, which may be disregarded by either the patient or the phone operative if common sense or caution suggests otherwise, is based on the known information and an implicit conclusion about what the ''worst-case'' diagnosis is likely to be (which is not always revealed to the patient, because it might well be incorrect and is not based on a medically-trained person's opinion - it is only used for initial triage purposes).

===Knowledge-based CDSS===
Most CDSSs consist of three parts: the knowledge base, an [[inference engine]], and a mechanism to communicate. The knowledge base contains the rules and associations of compiled data which most often take the form of IF-THEN rules. If this was a system for determining [[drug interactions]], then a rule might be that IF drug X is taken AND drug Y is taken THEN alert user. Using another interface, an advanced user could edit the knowledge base to keep it up to date with new drugs. The inference engine combines the rules from the knowledge base with the patient's data. The communication mechanism allows the system to show the results to the user as well as have input into the system.&lt;ref name="Open Clinical DSS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berner"/&gt;

===Non-knowledge-based CDSS===
CDSSs that do not use a knowledge base use a form of [[artificial intelligence]] called [[machine learning]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood plenary talk: The Role of Machine Learning in Clinical Decision Support|journal=SPIE Newsroom|date=March 2015|doi=10.1117/2.3201503.29|last1=Spie}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allow computers to learn from past experiences and/or find patterns in clinical data.  This eliminates the need for writing rules and for expert input. However, since systems based on machine learning cannot ''explain'' the reasons for their conclusions (they are so-called "black boxes", because no meaningful information about how they work can be discerned by human inspection), most clinicians do not use them directly for diagnoses, for reliability and accountability reasons.&lt;ref name="Open Clinical DSS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berner" /&gt; Nevertheless, they can be useful as post-diagnostic systems, for suggesting patterns for clinicians to look into in more depth.

Three types of non-knowledge-based systems are support vector machines, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wagholikar |first=Kavishwar |author2=V. Sundararajan |author3=Ashok Deshpande  |title=Modeling Paradigms for Medical Diagnostic Decision Support: A Survey and Future Directions |year=2012|pages=3029–3049 |doi=10.1007/s10916-011-9780-4 |volume=36 |issue=5 |journal=Journal of Medical Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Artificial neural network]]s use nodes and weighted connections between them to analyse the patterns found in patient data to derive associations between symptoms and a diagnosis.
#[[Genetic algorithm]]s are based on simplified evolutionary processes using directed selection to achieve optimal CDSS results. The selection algorithms evaluate components of random sets of solutions to a problem. The solutions that come out on top are then recombined and mutated and run through the process again. This happens over and over until the proper solution is discovered. They are functionally similar to neural networks in that they are also "black boxes" that attempt to derive knowledge from patient data.
#Non-knowledge-based networks often focus on a narrow list of symptoms, such as symptoms for a single disease, as opposed to the knowledge based approach which cover the diagnosis of many different diseases.&lt;ref name="Open Clinical DSS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berner" /&gt;

==Regulations==

=== United States ===
With the enactment of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (ARRA), there is a push for widespread adoption of [[health information technology]] through the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). Through these initiatives, more hospitals and clinics are integrating [[electronic medical record]]s (EMRs) and [[computerized physician order entry]] (CPOE) within their health information processing and storage. Consequently, the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) promoted usage of health information technology including clinical decision support systems to advance quality of patient care.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The IOM had published a report in 1999, ''[[To Err is Human]]'', which focused on the patient safety crisis in the United States, pointing to the incredibly high number of deaths. This statistic attracted great attention to the quality of patient care.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

With the enactment of the HITECH Act included in the ARRA, encouraging the adoption of health IT, more detailed case laws for CDSS and EMRs are still{{When|date = April 2015}} being defined by the Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and approved by [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). A definition of "Meaningful use" is yet to be published.{{Clarify|date=April 2015}}

Despite the absence of laws, the CDSS vendors would almost certainly be viewed as having a legal duty of care to both the patients who may adversely be affected due to CDSS usage and the clinicians who may use the technology for patient care.{{Citation needed|date = April 2015}}{{Clarify|date=April 2015}} However, duties of care legal regulations are not explicitly defined yet.

With recent effective legislations related to performance shift payment incentives, CDSS are becoming more attractive.{{Citation needed|date = April 2015}}{{Clarify|date=April 2015}}

==Challenges to adoption==

===Clinical challenges===
Much effort has been put forth by many medical institutions and software companies to produce viable CDSSs to support all aspects of clinical tasks. However, with the complexity of clinical workflows and the demands on staff time high, care must be taken by the institution deploying the support system to ensure that the system becomes a fluid and integral part of the clinical workflow. Some CDSSs have met with varying amounts of success, while others have suffered from common problems preventing or reducing successful adoption and acceptance.

Two sectors of the healthcare domain in which CDSSs have had a large impact are the pharmacy and billing sectors. There are commonly used pharmacy and prescription ordering systems that now perform batch-based checking of orders for negative drug interactions and report warnings to the ordering professional. Another sector of success for CDSS is in billing and claims filing. Since many hospitals rely on [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] reimbursements to stay in operation, systems have been created to help examine both a proposed treatment plan and the current rules of Medicare in order to suggest a plan that attempts to address both the care of the patient and the financial needs of the institution.

Other CDSSs that are aimed at diagnostic tasks have found success, but are often very limited in deployment and scope. The Leeds Abdominal Pain System went operational in 1971 for the University of Leeds hospital, and was reported to have produced a correct diagnosis in 91.8% of cases, compared to the clinicians' success rate of 79.6%.{{Citation needed|date = April 2015}}

Despite the wide range of efforts by institutions to produce and use these systems, widespread adoption and acceptance has still not yet been achieved for most offerings. One large roadblock to acceptance has historically been workflow integration. A tendency to focus only on the functional decision making core of the CDSS existed, causing a deficiency in planning for how the clinician will actually use the product in situ. Often CDSSs were stand-alone applications, requiring the clinician to cease working on their current system, switch to the CDSS, input the necessary data (even if it had already been inputted into another system), and examine the results produced. The additional steps break the flow from the clinician's perspective and cost precious time.

===Technical challenges and barriers to implementation===
Clinical decision support systems face steep technical challenges in a number of areas. Biological systems are profoundly complicated, and a clinical decision may utilize an enormous range of potentially relevant data. For example, an electronic [[evidence-based medicine]] system may potentially consider a patient's symptoms, medical history, [[family history (medicine)|family history]] and [[genetics]], as well as historical and geographical trends of disease occurrence, and published clinical data on medicinal effectiveness when recommending a patient's course of treatment.

Clinically, a large deterrent to CDSS acceptance is workflow integration, as mentioned above.

Another source of contention with many medical support systems is that they produce a massive number of alerts. When systems produce high volume of warnings (especially those that do not require escalation), aside from the annoyance, clinicians may pay less attention to warnings, causing potentially critical alerts to be missed.

===Maintenance===
One of the core challenges facing CDSS is difficulty in incorporating the extensive quantity of clinical research being published on an ongoing basis. In a given year, tens of thousands of clinical trials are published.&lt;ref name="pmid17326823"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Gluud C, Nikolova D | title=Likely country of origin in publications on randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials during the last 60 years. | journal=Trials | year= 2007 | volume= 8 |pages=7 | pmid=17326823| url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=clinical.uthscsa.edu/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=17326823 | doi=10.1186/1745-6215-8-7 | pmc=1808475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, each one of these studies must be manually read, evaluated for scientific legitimacy, and incorporated into the CDSS in an accurate way. In 2004, it was stated that the process of gathering clinical data and medical knowledge and putting them into a form that computers can manipulate to assist in clinical decision-support is "still in its infancy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Reed M|title=Computerized Clinical Decision-Support in Respiratory Care|journal=Respiratory Care|date=April 2004|volume=49|pages=378–388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it is more feasible for a business to do this centrally, even if incompletely, than for each individual doctor to try to keep up with all the research being published.

In addition to being laborious, integration of new data can sometimes be difficult to quantify or incorporate into the existing decision support schema, particularly in instances where different clinical papers may appear conflicting. Properly resolving these sorts of discrepancies is often the subject of clinical papers itself (see [[meta-analysis]]), which often take months to complete.

===Evaluation===
In order for a CDSS to offer value, it must demonstrably improve clinical workflow or outcome. Evaluation of CDSS is the process of quantifying its value to improve a system's quality and measure its effectiveness. Because different CDSSs serve different purposes, there is no generic metric which applies to all such systems; however, attributes such as consistency (with itself, and with experts) often apply across a wide spectrum of systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wagholikar |first=K |author2=Kathy L. MacLaughlin |author3=Thomas M Kastner |author4=Petra M Casey |author5=Michael Henry |author6=Robert A Greenes |author7=Hongfang Liu |author8= Rajeev Chaudhry |title=Formative evaluation of the accuracy of a clinical decision support system for cervical cancer screening |year=2013|pages=747–759 |doi=10.1136/amiajnl-2013-001613 |volume=20 |issue=4 |journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|pmc=3721177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evaluation benchmark for a CDSS depends on the system's goal: for example, a diagnostic decision support system may be rated based upon the consistency and accuracy of its classification of disease (as compared to physicians or other decision support systems). An evidence-based medicine system might be rated based upon a high incidence of patient improvement, or higher financial reimbursement for care providers.

==Combining with electronic health records==
Implementing electronic health records (EHR) was an inevitable challenge. The reasons behind this challenge are that it is a relatively uncharted area, and there are many issues and complications during the implementation phase of an EHR. This can be seen in the numerous studies that have been undertaken.{{Citation needed|date = April 2015}} However, challenges in implementing electronic health records (EHRs) have received some attention, but less is known about the process of transitioning from [[Legacy software|legacy]] EHRs to newer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zandieh|first=Stephanie O.|author2=Kahyun Yoon-Flannery |author3=Gilad J. Kuperman |author4=Daniel J. Langsam |author5=Daniel Hyman |author6= Rainu Kaushal |title=Challenges to EHR Implementation in Electronic- Versus Paper-based Office Practices|journal=Journal of Global Information Management|year=2008|pages=755–761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With all of that said, electronic health records are the way of the future for healthcare industry. They are a way to capture and utilise real-time data to provide high-quality patient care, ensuring efficiency and effective use of time and resources. Incorporating EHR and CDSS together into the process of medicine has the potential to change the way medicine has been taught and practiced.&lt;ref name="Berner 2007 3–22"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berner|first=Eta S.|title=Clinical Decision Support Systems: Theory and Practice|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science and Business Media|location=New York|pages=3–22|edition=2|author2=Tonya J.La Lande|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that "the highest level of EHR is a CDSS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothman|first=Brian|author2=Joan. C. Leonard |author3=Michael. M. Vigoda |title=Future of electronic health records: implications for decision support|journal=Mount Sinai Journal of Medicine|year=2012|volume=79|issue=6|pages=757–768|doi=10.1002/msj.21351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since "clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are computer systems designed to impact clinician decision making about individual patients at the point in time that these decisions are made",&lt;ref name="Berner 2007 3–22" /&gt; it is clear that it would be beneficial to have a fully integrated CDSS and EHR.

Even though the benefits can be seen, to fully implement a CDSS that is integrated with an EHR has historically required significant planning by the healthcare facility/organisation, in order for the purpose of the CDSS to be successful and effective. 
The success and effectiveness can be measured by the increase in patient care being delivered and reduced [[adverse events]] occurring. In addition to this, there would be a saving of time and resources, and benefits in terms of autonomy and financial benefits to the healthcare facility/organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sambasivan|first=Murali |author2=Pouyan Esmaeilzadeh |author3=Naresh Kumar |author4=Hossein Nezakati|title=Intention to adopt clinical decision support systems in a developing country: effect of Physician's perceived professional autonomy, involvement and belief: a cross-sectional study|journal=BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making|year=2012|volume=12|pages=142–150|doi=10.1186/1472-6947-12-142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of CDSS combined with EHR===
A successful CDSS/EHR integration will allow the provision of best practice, high quality care to the patient, which is the ultimate goal of healthcare.

Errors have always occurred in healthcare, so trying to minimise them as much as possible is important in order to provide quality patient care. Three areas that can be addressed with the implementation of CDSS and Electronic Health Records (EHRs), are:
# Medication prescription errors
# Adverse drug events
# Other medical errors
CDSSs will be most beneficial in the future when healthcare facilities are "100% electronic" in terms of real-time patient information, thus simplifying the number of modifications that have to occur to ensure that all the systems are up to date with each other.

The measurable benefits of clinical decision support systems on physician performance and patient outcomes remain the subject of ongoing research, as noted in the {{section link||Effectiveness}} section above.

===Barriers===

Implementing electronic health records (EHR) in healthcare settings incurs challenges; none more important than maintaining efficiency and safety during rollout,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spellman Kennebeck|first=Stephanie|author2=Nathan Timm |author3=Michael K Farrell |author4=S Andrew Spooner |title=Impact of electronic health record implementation on patient flow metrics in a pediatric emergency department|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|year=2012|pages=443–447|doi=10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000462 |volume=19|issue=3|pmc=3341791|pmid=22052897}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in order for the implementation process to be effective, an understanding of the EHR users' perspectives is key to the success of EHR implementation projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McGinn | first=Carrie Anna | last2=Gagnon | first2=Marie-Pierre | last3=Shaw | first3=Nicola | last4=Sicotte | first4=Claude | last5=Mathieu | first5=Luc | last6=Leduc | first6=Yvan | last7=Grenier | first7=Sonya | last8=Duplantie | first8=Julie | last9=Abdeljelil | first9=Anis Ben | last10=Légaré | first10=France | title=Users' perspectives of key factors to implementing electronic health records in Canada: a Delphi study | journal=BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=105 | date=2012-09-11 | issn=1472-6947 | pmid=22967231 | pmc=3470948 | doi=10.1186/1472-6947-12-105 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, adoption needs to be actively fostered through a bottom-up, clinical-needs-first approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rozenblum | first=R. | last2=Jang | first2=Y. | last3=Zimlichman | first3=E. | last4=Salzberg | first4=C. | last5=Tamblyn | first5=M. | last6=Buckeridge | first6=D. | last7=Forster | first7=A. | last8=Bates | first8=D.

The main areas of concern with moving into a fully integrated EHR/CDSS system are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berner|first=Eta S.|title=Clinical Decision Support Systems: Theory and Practice|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science and Business Media|location=New York|pages=64–98|edition=2|author2=Tonya J.La Lande|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Privacy
#Confidentiality
#User-friendliness
#Document accuracy and completeness
#Integration
#Uniformity
#Acceptance
#Alert desensitisation

as well as the key aspects of data entry that need to be addressed when implementing a CDSS to avoid potential adverse events from occurring. These aspects include whether:
* correct data is being used
* all the data has been entered into the system
* current best practice is being followed
* the data is evidence-based{{Clarify|date = April 2015}}
A [[service oriented architecture]] has been proposed as a technical means to address some of these barriers.&lt;ref name="pm"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 25325996| year = 2014| author1 = Loya| first1 = S.

===Status in Australia===
As of July 2015, the planned transition to EHRs in Australia is facing difficulties. The majority of healthcare facilities are still running completely paper-based systems, and some are in a transition phase of scanned EHRs, or are moving towards such a transition phase.

Victoria has attempted to implement EHR across the state with its HealthSMART program, but due to unexpectedly high costs it has cancelled the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Charette|first=Robert N.|title=Troubled HealthSMART System Finally Cancelled in Victoria Australia|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/troubled-healthsmart-system-finally-cancelled-in-victoria-australia-|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Australia (SA) however is slightly more successful than Victoria in the implementation of an EHR. This may be due to all public healthcare organisations in SA being centrally run. (However, on the other hand, the UK's [[National Health Service]] is also centrally administered, and its [[National Programme for IT]] in the 2000s, which included EHRs in its remit, was an expensive disaster.)

SA is in the process of implementing "Enterprise [[patient administration system]] (EPAS)". This system is the foundation for all public hospitals and health care sites for an EHR within SA and it was expected that by the end of 2014 all facilities in SA will be connected to it. This would allow for successful integration of CDSS into SA and increase the benefits of the EHR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EPAS program update |url=http://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/public+content/sa+health+internet/health+reform/ehealth/enterprise+patient+administration+system/epas+program+update|publisher=South Australian Health |accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By July 2015 it was reported that only 3 out of 75 health care facilities implemented EPAS.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-01/hospital-beds-closure-epas-electronic-records-delay/6586492 as accessed on 26 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

With the largest health system in the country and a federated rather than centrally administered model, New South Wales is making consistent progress towards statewide implementation of EHRs. The current iteration of the state's technology, eMR2, includes CDSS features such as a sepsis pathway for identifying at-risk patients based upon data input to the electronic record. As of June 2016, 93 of 194 sites in-scope for the initial roll-out had implemented eMR2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= The eMR turns 10 |title= eHealth News |url=http://www.ehealth.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/318981/eHealthNEWS_May-June-2016_web.pdf|work= eHealth News |accessdate= 6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences''' ('''CIOMS''') is an [[international nongovernmental organization]] established jointly by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] in 1949. CIOMS represents a substantial proportion of the biomedical scientific community through its member organizations. The mission of CIOMS is to advance public health through guidance on health research including ethics, medical product development and safety.

==History==
1949: The ''Council for Coordination of International Medical Congresses'' was formally constituted at a jointly-sponsored conference in Brussels. The Council’s original objective was to coordinate and support the work of international organizations of medical sciences through information exchange and financial assistance to organizers of congresses and to the individuals attending them. The scope of activities was gradually broadened to include other forms of international collaboration in medical sciences.&lt;br&gt;

1952: The name of the Council was changed to Council for International Organisations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS), and its statutes were revised.&lt;br&gt;

1959: CIOMS organised a meeting in Vienna under the joint auspices of UNESCO and WHO, “to discuss the principles, organization and scope of “controlled clinical trials”, which must be carried out if new methods or preparations used for the treatment of disease are to be accurately assessed clinically”. This meeting was a methodological landmark in clinical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bird |first1=Sheila M |title=The 1959 meeting in Vienna on controlled clinical trials – a methodological landmark. |journal=JLL Bulletin: Commentaries on the history of treatment evaluation |date=2014 |url=http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/articles/the-1959-meeting-in-vienna-on-controlled-clinical-trials-a-methodological-landmark/ |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
1966: CIOMS reduced its financial assistance towards congresses on purely scientific medical subjects, as it was felt that this was an unnecessary duplication of the large number of scientific meetings being held. &lt;br&gt;

In the years that followed, CIOMS changed its main activities to address some of the social and cultural implications resulting from the rapid progress in biomedical science and the emergence of a new world order with a large number of newly-independent countries. CIOMS started to convene multi-disciplinary international conferences concerned with bioethics, health policy, medical education and health services research. 
Over the next 20 years these working modalities evolved and gradually led to convening specialized international Working Groups with the aim of publishing well balanced reports on topics related to research ethics, drug development and safe use of medicines.&lt;br&gt;

2016: CIOMS joined the [[International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]] (ICH) as an observer.

==Guidelines for research on human subjects==
The ''[https://cioms.ch/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/International_Ethical_Guidelines_for_Biomedical_Research_Involving_Human_Subjects.pdf International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects]'', sometimes informally referred to as
''CIOMS Guidelines'', is a set of ethical principles regarding [[human experimentation]] created in 1993 by CIOMS and updated in 2002. These 21 guidelines (15 in the original report) address issues including [[Informed consent]], standards for external review, recruitment of participants, and more. The Guidelines are general instructions and principles of ethical biomedical research.&lt;ref name=CIOMS&gt;{{cite book|title=International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects|publisher=CIOMS in collaboration with WHO|location=Geneva|isbn=9290360755 |edition=3rd|url=http://www.cioms.ch/publications/guidelines/guidelines_nov_2002_blurb.htm|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
In 2016 new CIOMS ethical Guidelines titled "[https://cioms.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WEB-CIOMS-EthicalGuidelines.pdf International ethical guidelines for health-related research involving humans]" were published. These guidelines were prepared in collaboration with WHO and address additional topics. They stress the need for research that has scientific and social value, provide special guidance for health-related research in low-resource settings, detail the provisions for involving vulnerable groups in research, and describe under what conditions biological samples and health-related data can be used for research.&lt;ref name=CIOMS2&gt;{{cite book|title=International ethical guidelines for health-related research involving humans|publisher=CIOMS in collaboration with WHO|location=Geneva|isbn=9789290360889|url=https://cioms.ch/shop/product/international-ethical-guidelines-for-health-related-research-involving-humans/|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guidelines on medicines safety==
The first systematic international efforts to address medicines safety issues started after 1961, when [[thalidomide]], a medication given to pregnant women to alleviate nausea, led to many thousands of infants being born with deformities. It is not an exaggeration to say that CIOMS guidelines have formed the basis of modern [[pharmacovigilance]], and several CIOMS guidelines were the basis of creating respective ICH guidelines. Some examples: &lt;br&gt;

''ICH-E2A (1994): Clinical Safety Data Management – Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting'' was based on the reports of CIOMS Working Groups (WG) I and II for marketed medicinal products (published 1990 and 1992). &lt;br&gt;

''ICH-E2C (1996):’Clinical Safety Data Management – Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Reports'' described the specifications for format and content of periodic safety update reports (PSURs) and was based on the reports of CIOMS WG II and III (published in 1992, 1995). &lt;br&gt;

''ICH-E2D (2003): Post-Approval Safety Management – Definitions and Standards for Expedited reporting'' formalized the application of relevant elements of ‘’ICH-E2A’’ in the post-authorization phase and was based on the reports of CIOMS WG V (2001). &lt;br&gt;

''ICH-E2F (2010): Development Safety Update Reports'' was based on the report of CIOMS WG VIII (published 2006) and describes the specifications for format and content of development safety update reports (DSURs).&lt;br&gt;

More recently, the CIOMS Working Group on Vaccine Safety has completed published guidance on safety surveillance for new vaccines, especially those introduced early or exclusively to countries with limited pharmacovigilance experience and infrastructure, and on how to communicate information around vaccine safety issues to the public. 

==Guidelines for animal testing==
The Council has also issued ''International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals''.&lt;ref name=CIOMS /&gt;

'''Dental surgery''' is any of a number of [[medical procedure]]s that involve artificially modifying [[dentition]]; in other words, [[surgery]] of the teeth and jaw bones.

==Types==

Some of the more common are:

* '''[[Endodontic]]''' (surgery involving the [[pulp (tooth)|pulp]] or root of the [[tooth]])
** [[Root canal]]
*** [[Pulpotomy]] &amp;mdash; the opening of the pulp chamber of the tooth to allow an infection to drain; usually a precursor to a root canal
*** [[Pulpectomy]] &amp;mdash; the removal of the pulp from the pulp chamber to temporarily relieve pain; usually a precursor to a root canal
** [[Apicoectomy]] &amp;mdash; a root-end resection.  Occasionally a root canal alone is be enough to relieve pain and the end of the tooth, called the apex, is removed by entering through the [[gingiva]] and surgically extracting the diseased material.
* '''[[Prosthodontics]]''' (dental prosthetics)
** [[Crown (dentistry)|Crown]] (caps) &amp;mdash; artificial covering of a tooth made from a variety of biocompatible materials, including CMC/PMC (ceramic/porcelain metal composite), gold or a tin/aluminum mixture.  The underlying tooth must be reshaped to accommodate these fixed restorations 
** [[Veneer (dentistry)|Veneers]] &amp;mdash; artificial coverings similar to above, except that they only cover the forward (labial or buccal) surface of the tooth. Usually for aesthetic purposes only.
** [[Bridge (dentistry)|Bridge]] &amp;mdash; a fixed prothesis in which two or more crowns are connected together, which replace a missing tooth or teeth through a bridge.  Typically used after an extraction.
** [[Dental implant|Implant]] &amp;mdash; a procedure in which a titanium implant is surgically placed in the bone (mandible or maxilla), allowed to heal, and 4–6 months later an [[artificial tooth]] is connected to the implant by cement or retained by a screw.
** [[Denture]]s (false teeth) &amp;mdash; a partial or complete set of dentition which either attach to neighboring teeth by use of metal or plastic grasps or to the gingival or palatal surface by use of adhesive.
** Implant-supported prosthesis &amp;mdash; a combination of dentures and implants; bases are placed into the bone, allowed to heal, and metal appliances are fixed to the gingival surface, following which dentures are placed atop and fixed into place.
* '''[[Orthodontic]]''' treatment
** Implants and implant-supported prosthesis &amp;mdash; also an orthodontic treatment as it involves bones
* [[Apicoectomy]] &amp;mdash; also an orthodontic treatment as part of the underlying bone structure must be removed
** [[Extraction (dental)|Extraction]] &amp;mdash; a procedure in which a diseased, redundant, or problematic tooth is removed, either by pulling or cutting out.  This procedure can be done under local or general [[anesthesia]] and is very common &amp;mdash; many people have their [[wisdom teeth]] removed before they become problematic.
**[[Fiberotomy]] &amp;mdash; a procedure to sever the fibers around a tooth, preventing it from relapsing
*'''[[Periodontics]]'''
*'''[[Oral and maxillofacial surgery]]'''

==Professional dental care==
{{See also|Oral hygiene}}
[[Image:Tooth polishing 9332.JPG|right|thumb|Dental hygienist polishing a patient's teeth]] 

More frequent than usual cleaning and examination may be necessary during the treatment of many different dental/oral disorders or due to recent surgical procedures such as [[dental implants]]. The American Dental Association (ADA) stresses that the frequency of dental visits necessary is dependent upon the needs of each individual with some able to go once or twice a year and others needing to go more often. This may include yearly, select [[dental X-rays]]. See also [[dental plaque]] identification procedure and removal.

==Dental anesthesia==
{{Main|Dental anesthesia}}
[[Dentists]] [[Injection (medicine)|inject]] [[anesthetic]] to block [[sensory transmission]] by the [[alveolar nerve (disambiguation)|alveolar nerve]]s. The [[superior alveolar nerves (disambiguation)|superior alveolar nerves]] are not usually anesthetized directly because they are difficult to approach with a [[Hypodermic needle|needle]]. For this reason, the [[maxillary teeth]] are usually [[anesthetized locally]] by inserting the needle beneath the [[oral mucosa]] surrounding the teeth. The [[inferior alveolar nerve]] is probably anesthetized more often than any other nerve in the body. To anesthetize this nerve, the dentist inserts the needle somewhat posterior to the patient’s last [[Molar (tooth)|molar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10964">'''Facultative lagoons''' are a type of [[waste stabilization pond]] used for biological treatment of industrial and domestic [[wastewater]].  [[Sewage]] or organic waste from food or fiber processing may be catabolized in a system of constructed ponds where adequate space is available to provide an average waste retention time exceeding a month.  A series of ponds prevents mixing of untreated waste with treated wastewater and allows better control of waste residence time for uniform treatment efficiency.
[[File:Facultative pond (6898410678).jpg|thumb|Facultative lagoon in Kenya.]]

== Fundamentals ==

===First pond===
The facultative lagoon in the pond sequence functions like the primary clarifier of a conventional [[sewage treatment]] system.  Heavy solids will settle to the bottom of the lagoon, and lighter solids will float.  This facultative lagoon lacks the [[sludge]] removal capability of a primary clarifier, so a population of [[anaerobic organism]]s will colonize accumulated sludge on the bottom of the lagoon.  The surface area of the lagoon should be large enough to provide an atmospheric [[oxygen]] transfer rate adequate to prevent anaerobic conditions on the lagoon surface.  Intermediate depths of the lagoon support facultative micro-organisms capable of oxidizing both the dissolved and suspended organics from the original wastewater and the products of anaerobic [[catabolism]] on the bottom of the lagoon.&lt;ref name=metcalf&amp;eddy&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy (1972) pp.552-554&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerwater.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/43946/wsp_design_manual.pdf|title=Waste Stabilisation Pond Design Manual|last=Ashworth|first=J|last2=Skinner|first2=M|date=19 December 2011|website=|publisher=Power and Water Corporation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas with a consistently cool, but frost-free, climate may sustain facultative conditions in the first stabilization pond when treating lightly polluted water at low temperatures favorable to high concentrations of [[dissolved oxygen]] with low [[metabolic rate]]s. Facultative pond stratification becomes unstable during cold weather increasing release of malodorous gas when water temperatures drop below 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Reid, George K. | title=Ecology of Inland Waters and Estuaries | year=1961 |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Company |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formation of ice on the pond surface will effectively prevent transfer of atmospheric oxygen to the pond biome. Stabilization ponds in climates with significant seasonal temperature variation may release malodorous gas during the season of rising temperatures as the pond biome consumes wastes accumulated during cold weather with increasing metabolic rates exceeding the atmospheric oxygen transfer rate at the pond surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hammer, Mark J. | title=Water and Waste-Water Technology | year=1975 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | pages=399-402 | isbn=0-471-34726-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent polishing ponds===
[[File:Hamburg-Allermöhe, pond for effluent from constructed wetland (3252521437).jpg|thumb|Facultative lagoon (polishing pond) providing tertiary treatment after a [[constructed wetland]] in Hamburg-Allermöhe, Germany]]
Overflow from the facultative lagoon may be routed through one or more polishing ponds supporting lower populations of anaerobic micro-organisms and a higher proportion of aerobic organisms adapted to survival in lower concentrations of organic material.  [[Effluent]] from the final polishing pond may be suitable for discharge to natural receiving waters.&lt;ref name=Hammer&gt;Hammer (1975) pp.399-402&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxygen transfer and algae===
Objectionable odors are likely when the rate of oxygen transfer from the lagoon surface is less than the rate of oxygen consumption in the lower levels of the lagoon.  A {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} facultative lagoon might provide 50 pounds of oxygen per day (5&amp;nbsp;grams of oxygen per square meter per day) for biochemical catabolism.  Biological activity within a facultative lagoon varies directly with temperature.  Warm weather will require large oxygen transfer rates, and waste accumulation during cold weather can cause short-term warm weather oxygen requirements to exceed long-term waste loading rates.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;  [[Algae]] can provide surface oxygen during daylight hours, but algal respiration can require additional oxygen during darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Fair, Geyer &amp; Okun (1968) p.34-11&lt;/ref&gt;  Ice or scum mats can reduce the oxygen transfer surface.  Some facultative lagoons use mechanical surface aerators to increase atmospheric oxygen transfer, but aerator mixing depth should not re-suspend anaerobic sludge from the bottom of the lagoon.  Aerator operation may be limited to periods of heavy waste loads, high temperatures, darkness, low wind velocity, or other conditions threatening to cause anaerobic conditions on the lagoon surface.&lt;ref name=metcalf&amp;eddy/&gt;

Facultative stabilization ponds [[Stratification (water)|stratify]] with an aerobic surface layer and an anaerobic layer below the surface. The aerobic surface layer limits release of malodorous gas from the anaerobic benthic zone. Algae and [[cyanobacteria]] typically grow in the aerobic zone and provide bacteria in the pond with plenty of oxygen during the daytime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, algal [[photorespiration]] may consume oxygen during night time when it is dark. Waste tabilization ponds with large algal populations may show significant [[diurnality|diurnal]] fluctuation in oxygen concentrations with a peak in the late afternoon, and a minimum at dawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutherson |first=Suthan S. |authorlink = |title =Natural and Enhanced Remediation Systems |publisher =CRC Press |volume = |edition = |date =2001 |location = |page =279 |isbn =1420033069}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kinds of algae growing in treatment ponds include green, red and brown algae.the environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Cincinnati, O. (2010, June 29). ''[http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/P100C8HC.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=2011%20Thru%202015&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;UseQField=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C11THRU15%5CTXT%5C00000000%5CP100C8HC.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=p%7Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=45 NEPIS document display]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimum temperature===
Vertical stratification including an aerobic surface layer, an anaerobic bottom layer, and a facultative intermediate layer is essential to proper functioning of a facultative lagoon ecosystem.  Stratification is maintained by a thermal gradient of cool, dense water at the bottom of the lagoon overlain by warmer, less dense water on the surface.  This thermal gradient becomes unstable when water reaches its maximum density at 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit).  Facultative lagoons are impractical in cold climates, because the lagoons become non-functional when cooler air temperatures depress water temperatures below this critical value.&lt;ref&gt;Reid (1961) p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design considerations==
Inert solids in wastewater will accumulate on the bottom of the lagoon and gradually reduce depth until there is inadequate room for the facultative zone.  Lagoon depths between 2 and 5 feet (60 to 150&amp;nbsp;cm) are preferred for effective treatment.  Parallel facultative lagoons with common polishing ponds allow wastewater treatment to continue while one lagoon is out of service for sludge removal.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;

[[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] falling on the surface of the lagoons and polishing ponds will increase the volume of wastewater requiring disposal.  Conversely, the volume of wastewater may be reduced by evaporation from the water surface in arid climates.

Wastewater nutrients may cause continuing growth of algae in the polishing ponds after the original wastes have been catabolized.  Algae may cause measurable contribution to [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) and [[total suspended solids]] (TSS) concentrations where discharge regulations include limitations on those concentrations.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;  The TSS contribution of algae tends to peak in the summer months, but the long-term BOD of decomposing algae may not be evident within the typical 5-day test.&lt;ref&gt;Weston (1971) p.7-1&lt;/ref&gt;  [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] regulations describe facultative lagoons as providing "treatment equivalent to secondary treatment" when 65 percent of influent BOD and TSS are removed and effluent BOD and TSS concentrations do not exceed a 7-day average of 65&amp;nbsp;mg/L and a 30-day average of 45&amp;nbsp;mg/L.  Individual States may establish alternative effluent limitations.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. "Treatment equivalent to secondary treatment." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|133|105}}. Accessed 2013-05-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similar processes===
The facultative lagoon may be replaced by an [[aerated lagoon]] as the first pond of the series.  Aerated lagoons have mechanical aerators which minimize anaerobic zones by completely mixing the lagoon to achieve catabolism through a process called [[extended aeration]].

The '''Football (Disorder) Act 2000''' is an [[Legislative act|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] enacted during the premiership of [[Tony Blair]]. It served as an amendment to the [[Football Spectators Act 1989]], and strengthened football banning orders (FBOs), a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] order imposed to those convicted of [[Association football|football]]-related offences. FBOs may be issued by courts in the United Kingdom, or following a complaint from a local police force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/football-related-arrests-and-banning-orders-season-2014-to-2015/football-related-arrests-and-banning-orders-season-2014-to-2015|title=Football-related arrests and banning orders season 2014 to 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Gov.uk]]|publisher=|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was "rushed through Parliament" by then-[[Home Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] following violent clashes during [[UEFA Euro 2000]] in France.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/899120.stm|title=Hooligan bill comes into force|date=28 August 2000|newspaper=BBC|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows police in [[England and Wales]] to arrest those suspected of travelling abroad to participate in [[Football hooliganism|hooliganism]] at international games, and to withhold their passports up to five days before an international fixture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Straw stated during an [[opposition day]] for his Bill that he was keen to enact the new laws in time for [[England national football team|England]]'s next international game against [[France national football team|France]] in September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2000-07-13a.1181.0#g1181.2|title=Football (Disorder) Bill: 13 Jul 2000: House of Commons debates|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[TheyWorkForYou]]|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FBOs, introduced by Football Spectators Act 1989, may ban an individual from football grounds in the United Kingdom for two to ten years, with provisions for individual cases. Supporters may also be barred from using [[public transport]] on matchdays, and from town centres and built-up, high-risk areas prior to and following matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inbrief.co.uk/football-law/football-banning-orders/|title=Football Banning Orders: How long do they last and how do they work?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=InBrief|language=en-GB|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1352703/Soccer-thugs-kick-off-for-the-most-violent-season-in-years.html|title=Soccer thugs kick off for 'the most violent season in years'|last=Smith|first=Michael|date=14 August 2000|website=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/football_related_offences/|title=Football Related Offences and Football Banning Orders|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Crown Prosecution Service]]|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life, training, and medical career===

Frank Henry Netter was born in [[Manhattan]] at [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Street]] and [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]], and grew up wanting to be an artist. In high school, he obtained a scholarship to study at the [[National Academy of Design]], doing so at night while continuing high school. After further studying at the [[Art Students League of New York]] and with private teachers, he began a commercial art career, quickly achieving success and doing work for the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''. However, his family disapproved of a career as an artist and he agreed to study medicine. After getting a degree at the [[City College of New York]], he completed medical school at [[New York University School of Medicine|New York University]] and a surgical internship at [[Bellevue Hospital]] and attempted to begin practicing medicine.&lt;ref name="Netter 2014"/&gt; However, as Netter put it: "This was in 1933—the depths of the Depression—and there was no such thing as medical practice. If a patient ever wandered into your office by mistake, he didn't pay."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QIRMAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22and+there+was+no+such+thing+as+medical+practice.+If+a+patient%22&amp;dq=%22and+there+was+no+such+thing+as+medical+practice.+If+a+patient%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlq926mprbAhVkDcAKHYRUDycQ6AEILTAB ''Medical Times'']. Romaine Pierson Pub, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early medical art career===
Having continued doing [[freelance]] art during his medical training, including some work for his professors, he fell back on medical art to supplement his income. In particular, pharmaceutical companies began seeking Netter for illustrations to help sell new products, such as [[Novocain]]. Soon after a misunderstanding wherein Netter asked for $1,500 for a series of 5 pictures and an advertising manager agreed to and paid $1,500 each - $7,500 for the series - Netter gave up the practice of medicine.

===Career with CIBA===


In 1936, the [[Ciba-Geigy|CIBA Pharmaceutical Company]] commissioned a small work from him, a fold-up illustration of a heart to promote the sale of [[digitalis]]. This proved hugely popular with physicians, and a reprint without the advertising copy was even more popular.

Quickly following on the success of the fold-up heart, fold-up versions of other organs were produced. Netter then proposed that a series of pathology illustrations be produced. These illustrations were distributed to physicians as cards in a folder, with advertising for CIBA products on the inside of the folder, and were also popular with physicians. CIBA then collected these illustrations in book form, producing the ''CIBA Collection of Medical Illustrations'', which ultimately comprised 8 volumes (13 books).

Beginning in 1948, CIBA also re-used illustrations by Netter in another series of materials to be given to physicians, the ''Clinical Symposia'' series. These were small magazine-like brochures that typically featured an extensive article on a medical condition, commonly with about a dozen of Netter's illustrations. This series was produced until at least the early 1990s. In 1989, Netter's ''Atlas of Human Anatomy'' was published, assembled from his previous paintings and correlated by updated diagrams.

CIBA's Medical Education Department (East Orange, NJ) filtered the paintings for printing, in an effort that The Big Green Books "might appear more 'even' over time."{{cite quote|date=August 2013}} This sometimes resulted in a considerable reduction of color variation from the truly-unique originals. Digital re-scanning of the originals continue to be published by the current copyright owner to the collection, Elsevier Medical Publishing.  Selected original paintings have been showcased internationally.

Netter's career was presented in a commemorative video by Ciba-Geigy in 1988.

===Skepticism===

Netter was skeptical of the claims of [[alternative medicine]] and [[fad diet]]s. He wrote ''Fad Diets Can Be Deadly'' (1975) which debunked the misleading claims of fad diets.&lt;ref&gt;Flinn, Lewis B. (1977). [https://archive.org/stream/delawaremedicalj4911medi#page/n101/mode/2up/ ''Review: Fad Diets Can Be Deadly by Frank Netter'']. ''Delaware Medical Journal'' 49 (2): 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In all, Netter produced nearly 4,000 illustrations, which have been included in countless publications.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, J. T. (2006). ''Frank H. Netter, M.D. (1906-1991): The Artist and His Legacy''. ''[[Clinical Anatomy]]'' 19 (6): 481-486.&lt;/ref&gt; In perspective, that number represents an image researched, sketched, and completely painted for every three business days for over 50 years.

The vast bulk of Netter's illustrations were produced for and owned by CIBA Pharmaceutical Company and its successor, [[CIBA-Geigy]], which has since merged with [[Sandoz Laboratories]] to become [[Novartis]]. In June 2000, Novartis sold its interest in Netter's works to MediMedia USA's subsidiary Icon Learning Systems, which in turn has sold the portfolio to [[Elsevier]], which continues to make his work available in various formats. His ''Atlas of Human Anatomy'' and other atlases have become a staple of medical education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11808">A '''glaucoma valve''' is a [[shunt (medical)|medical shunt]] used in the treatment of [[glaucoma]] to reduce the [[human eye|eye]]'s [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP).

==Mechanism==
The device works by bypassing the [[trabecular meshwork]] and redirecting the outflow of [[aqueous humour]] through a small tube into an outlet chamber or [[bleb (medicine)|bleb]]. The IOP generally decreases from around 33 to 10 mmHg by removing aqueous on average 2.75 microliters/min.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Richard F. |last1=Brubaker |title=Flow of Aqueous Humor in Humans &amp;#91;The Friedenwald Lecture&amp;#93; |journal=Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science |pmid=1748546 |url=http://www.iovs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1748546 |date=1991-12-01 |volume=32 |issue=13 |pages=3145–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Professor Anthony Molteno developed the first glaucoma drainage implant, in [[Cape Town]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glaucoma.org.nz/memberFiles/Eyelights11-05.pdf{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following on the success of the '''Molteno implant''', several varieties of device have been developed from the original, the '''Baerveldt tube shunt''', or the valved implants, such as the '''Ahmed glaucoma valve''' implant  and the later generation '''pressure ridge''' Molteno implants. These are indicated for glaucoma patients not responding to maximal medical therapy, with previous failed guarded filtering surgery (trabeculectomy). The flow tube is inserted into the anterior chamber of the eye and the plate is implanted underneath the conjunctiva to allow flow of aqueous fluid out of the eye into a chamber called a '''bleb'''.

The ExPress Mini Shunt is a newer, non-valved device that was originally designed to provide a direct conduit from the anterior chamber to the sub-conjunctival space or '''bleb'''. In this position it was unstable and tended to erode through the conjunctiva. Now the more common use is as a modification of the trabeculectomy procedure, placed under a scleral flap, replacing the sclerostomy step (see trabeculectomy).

In comparison to the glaucoma drainage devices that use an ab externo procedure, ab interno implants, such as the Xen Gel Stent, are transscleral implants to channel aqueous humor into the non-dissected Tenon's space, creating a subconjunctival drainage area similar to a bleb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis RA|title=Ab interno approach to the subconjunctival space using a collagen glaucoma stent.|journal=J Cataract Refract Surg|date=Aug 2014|volume=40 | issue = 8 |pages=1301–6|doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2014.01.032|pmid=24943904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xen Gel Stent|url=http://www.aquesys.com/xen.aspx|website=AqueSys|publisher=AqueSys|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implants are transscleral and different from more other ab interno implants that do not create a transscleral drainage, such as iStent, CyPass, or Hydrus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Advances in Glaucoma Filtration Surgery|url=http://glaucomatoday.com/2014/04/advances-in-glaucoma-filtration-surgery|accessdate=27 June 2015|publisher=Glaucoma Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane Review]] of various aqueous shunts and modifications found that the Baerveldt implant may result in lower IOP than the Ahmed implant, but it was unclear if the difference in IOP reduction was clinically significant.&lt;ref name="Tseng"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Tseng VL, Coleman AL, Chang MY, Caprioli J |title = Aqueous shunts for glaucoma |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume = 7 |pages = CD004918 |date = 2017 |pmid = 28750481 |doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004918.pub3 |pmc=5580949}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The review suggests that practitioners should operate with the devices that they are most comfortable with, and have the most experience using.

==Indications==
The glaucoma valve implant is indicated for glaucoma patients not responding to maximal medical therapy, with previous failed guarded filtering surgery ([[trabeculectomy]]) or in cases where conventional drainage surgery is unlikely to succeed. Common situations where the use of a glaucoma implant as a primary procedure is indicated include
* [[Neovascular glaucoma]] – glaucoma associated with vascular disease of the eye (often diabetes).
* Cases of [[Uveitis]] – acute or chronic inflammation of the eye.
* Traumatic glaucoma – glaucoma associated with injury to the eye.
* Silicone glaucoma – glaucoma due to Silicone used to repair a detached retina.
* Infantile/[[Juvenile glaucoma]] – often associated with developmental defects of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0301-4738.67039 |title=Evaluation of ahmed glaucoma valve implantation through a needle-generated scleral tunnel in Mexican children with glaucoma |year=2010 |last1=Oscar |first1=Albis-Donado |last2=Gil-Carrasco |first2=Gil-Carrasco |last3=Romero-Quijada |first3=Romero-Quijada |last4=Thomas |first4=Thomas |journal=Indian Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=365–73 |pmid=20689189 |pmc=2992909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surgical technique==
The flow tube is inserted into the anterior chamber of the eye and the plate is implanted underneath the conjunctiva to allow flow of aqueous fluid out of the eye. 
* The first-generation Molteno and other non-valved implants sometimes require the ligation of the tube until the bleb formed is mildly fibrosed and water-tight.&lt;ref name="VicrylTie"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3814422 |year=1986 |last1=Molteno |first1=AC |last2=Polkinghorne |first2=PJ |last3=Bowbyes |first3=JA |title=The vicryl tie technique for inserting a draining implant in the treatment of secondary glaucoma |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=343–54 |journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Ophthalmology |doi=10.1111/j.1442-9071.1986.tb00470.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done to reduce postoperative hypotony – sudden drops in postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP).
* Valved implants such as the Ahmed glaucoma valve attempt to control postoperative hypotony by using a mechanical valve. Studies show that in severe cases of glaucoma, double plate Molteno implants are associated with lower mean IOP in the long term compared to the Ahmed glaucoma valve.&lt;ref name="AhmedCompare"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11942556 |year=2002 |last1=Ayyala |first1=RS |last2=Zurakowski |first2=D |last3=Monshizadeh |first3=R |last4=Hong |first4=CH |last5=Richards |first5=D |last6=Layden |first6=WE |last7=Hutchinson |first7=BT |last8=Bellows |first8=AR |title=Comparison of double-plate Molteno and Ahmed glaucoma valve in patients with advanced uncontrolled glaucoma |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=94–101 |journal=Ophthalmic Surgery and Lasers}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Second and third generation Molteno implants incorporate a '''biological valve''' and studies show considerable improvement in postoperative outcome over the older style Ahmed and Molteno implants.
* Baervedlt shunts (non-valved) have been shown to have lower rates of surgical failure than Ahmed shunts (valved),&lt;ref name ="ABC"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20932583 |year=2011 |last1=Budenz |first1=DL |last2=Barton |first2=K |last3=Feuer |first3=WJ |last4=Schiffman |first4=J |last5=Costa |first5=VP |last6=Godfrey |first6=DG |last7=Buys |first7=YM |author8=Ahmed Baerveldt Comparison Study Group |title=Treatment outcomes in the Ahmed Baerveldt Comparison Study after 1 year of follow-up |volume=118 |issue=3 |pages=443–52 |doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2010.07.016 |pmc=3020266 |journal=Ophthalmology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="AVB"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21889801 |year=2011 |last1=Christakis |first1=PG |last2=Kalenak |first2=JW |last3=Zurakowski |first3=D |last4=Tsai |first4=JC |last5=Kammer |first5=JA |last6=Harasymowycz |first6=PJ |last7=Ahmed |first7=II |title=The Ahmed Versus Baerveldt study: One-year treatment outcomes |volume=118 |issue=11 |pages=2180–9 |doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2011.05.004 |journal=Ophthalmology}}&lt;/ref&gt; this have may be related to the high rate of valve failure, or to the larger plate surface of the Baerveldt shunt.

==Complications==
The majority of complications occur shortly after surgery. These are generally related to high pressure (due to inflammation following surgery) or low pressure (too much aqueous flow through the tube). Periods of low pressure which are more associated with non-valved shunts, can cause retinal detachments, maculopathy or haemorrhages. Periods of high pressures, which are more associated with valved shunts, are detrimental to the optic nerve. Long term complications of this surgery include diplopia and corneal oedema.

There are also device related complications, which will require surgical revision. For example, erosion, where the conjunctiva erodes over the shunt leaving it exposed, the condition of which may be revised or prevented in advance by the use of amniotic membrane,&lt;ref name="Ros" /&gt; The ologen collagen matrix facilitates tissue regeneration and its application over the site of device implantation can strengthen tissue recovery, reducing possibility of erosion.&lt;ref name="Rho"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rho|first=S|author2=Sung Y|author3=Ma KT|author4=Rho SH|author5=Kim CY|title=Bleb Analysis and Short-Term Results of Biodegradable Collagen Matrix-Augmented Ahmed Glaucoma Valve Implantation: 6-Month Follow-up|journal=Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci|date= 2015|volume=56|issue=10|pages=5896–903|doi=10.1167/iovs.15-17480|pmid=26348639}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sark"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=MS|author2=Sarkisian SR Jr.|title=Using a collagen matrix implant (Ologen) versus mitomycin-C as a wound healing modulator in trabeculectomy with the Ex-PRESS mini glaucoma device: a 12-month retrospective review.|journal=J Glaucoma|date= 2014|volume=23|issue=9|pages=649–52|doi=10.1097/IJG.0000000000000018|pmid=24240882}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ros"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosentreter|first=A|author2=Schield AM|author3=Dinslage S|author4=Dietlein TS|title=Biodegradable implant for tissue repair after glaucoma drainage device surgery|journal=J Glaucoma|date= 2012|volume=21|issue=2|pages=76–8|doi=10.1097/IJG.0b013e3182027ab0|pmid=21278584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ros2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosentreter|first=A|author2=Mellein AC|author3=Konen WW|author4=Dietlein TS|title=Capsule excision and Ologen™ implantation for revision after glaucoma drainage device surgery|journal=Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol.|date= 2010|volume=248|issue=9|pages=1319–24|doi=10.1007/s00417-010-1385-y|pmid=20405139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Apt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aptel|first=F|author2=Dumas S|author3=Denis P|title=Ultrasound biomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography imaging of filtering blebs after deep sclerectomy with new collagen implant|journal=Eur J Ophthalmol.|date= 2009|volume=19|issue=2|pages=223–30|pmid=19253238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the device malfunctions it may need to be replaced. Possible scenarios include blockage, where a particle becomes logged in the tube line blocking flow; retraction, where the tube line slips out of correct position such that flow is inhibited or halted; valve failure, where the valve stops working blocking flow completely.

Surgical failure occurs due to the ongoing scarring over the conjunctival dissipation segment of the shunt may become too thick for the [[aqueous humor]] to filter through. This may require preventive measures using anti-fibrotic medication like 5-fluorouracil (5FU) or Mitomycin-C (during the procedure), or creating a necessity for revision surgery with the sole or combinative use of biodegradable spacer or collagen matrix implant.&lt;ref name="Ros2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7299">'''Good clinical practice''' ('''GCP''') is an international quality standard that is provided by [[International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use|ICH]], an international body that defines a set of standards, which governments can then transpose into regulations for clinical trials involving human subjects. A similar guideline for clinical trials of [[medical device]]s is the international standard [[ISO 14155]], which is valid in the European Union as a harmonized standard. These standards for clinical trials are sometimes referred to as ICH-GCP or ISO-GCP to differentiate between the two and the lowest grade of recommendation in clinical guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guideline.gov/search/search.aspx?term=%27good+clinical+practice%27# Examples of clinical practice guidelines using 'good clinical practice' as lowest grade of recommendation]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GCP follows the [[International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use|International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]] (ICH) of GCP guidelines. GCP enforces tight guidelines on [[ethical]] aspects of a [[clinical study]]. High standards are required in terms of comprehensive documentation for the [[Clinical trial|clinical]] [[Protocol (science)|protocol]], record keeping, training, and facilities, including [[computers]] and software. [[Quality assurance]] and inspections ensure that these [[International standard|standards]] are achieved. GCP aims to ensure that the studies are scientifically authentic and that the clinical properties of the investigational product are properly documented.

GCP guidelines include protection of human rights for the subjects and volunteers in a clinical trial. It also provides assurance of the safety and efficacy of the newly developed compounds.

GCP guidelines include standards on how clinical trials should be conducted, define the roles and responsibilities of institutional review boards, clinical research investigators, clinical trial sponsors, and monitors. In the pharmaceutical industry monitors are often called [[clinical research associate]]s.

A series of unsuccessful and ineffective clinical trials in the past were the main reason for the creation of ICH (The International Council for Harmonisation) and GCP guidelines in the US and Europe. Such was the case with the Elixir Sulphanilamide disaster in 1937 or the Thalidomide incident of the 1960s.  These discussions ultimately led to the development of certain regulations and guidelines, which evolved into the code of practice by which all those involved in clinical research now work. This code is known as International Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice

The first indicator in the regulation of drugs is the Food and Drugs Act established in the US in 1906. It is considered to be the result of very dangerous and even deadly drugs that could have been sold legally just like any other medical goods. For example, such drugs were ‘Grandma’s Secret’ and ‘Kopp’s Baby’s Friend’, which contained a huge amount of morphine. ‘Dr King’s Consumption Cure’ and ‘Dr Bull’s Cough Syrup‘ are examples of drugs which had large doses of morphine and chloroform as well.

==Legal and Regulatory Status==
Although ICH GCP guidelines are recommended by the FDA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/scienceresearch/specialtopics/runningclinicaltrials/default.htm|title=Clinical Trials and Human Subject Protection|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are not statutory in the United States.

==Criticism==
GCP has been called 'a less morally authoritative document' than the [[Declaration of Helsinki]], lacking moral principles and guidance in the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61936-4 | volume=373 | issue=9657 | title=Helsinki discords: FDA, ethics, and international drug trials | journal=The Lancet | pages=13–14| year=2009 | last1=Kimmelman | first1=Jonathan | last2=Weijer | first2=Charles | last3=Meslin | first3=Eric M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disclosure of conflict of interest
* Public disclosure of study design
* Benefit for populations in which research is conducted
* Reporting of accurate results and publication of negative findings
* Access to treatment after research has been conducted
* Restriction of use of placebo in control group where effective alternative treatment is available

In the book ''[[Bad Pharma]]'', [[Ben Goldacre]] mentions these criticisms and notes that the GCP rules "aren't terrible... [they are] more focused on procedures, while Helsinki clearly articulates moral principles".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = Fourth Estate|publication-place = London|title = Bad Pharma|url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL25682902M/Bad_Pharma|author = Ben Goldacre|publication-date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harold Homer Anderson''' (October 23, 1897 – February 9, 1990) was an American research professor of [[psychology]] at [[Michigan State University]], who published on [[child psychology]], [[clinical psychology]], [[Personality psychology|personality]], and cross-national research.

Anderson was the son of a minister from [[Nebraska]], who studied at the [[Northwestern University]]. In 1933 he accepted a position as professor of psychology and head of the department  at [[Michigan State College]]. In 1951 Harald H. Anderson was rewarded the Alumni Medal of the [[Northwestern University]]. In the 1950s he was among the first members of the [[Society for General Systems Research]].

== Work ==

=== Climate in the classroom ===
One of the earliest systematic studies of "climate" in the classroom was undertaken by Harold H. Anderson and [[Helen M. Brewer]]. These are reported in several papers and collected in the 1946 publication ''Studies of Teachers' Classroom Personalities''. These researches were carried out in many schools and different classes from kindergarten to children in early adolescence. The aim was to make certain that behavior, as analysed into different categories, could in fact be observed objectively.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Kenneth &amp; Cosway Ottaway (1998), ''Education and Society: An Introduction to the Sociology of Education''. Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-17754-5}} pp.136-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their recording of "dominative" and "integrative" actions of teachers and pupils in classroom interaction clearly demonstrated that acts of the teachers set behavior patterns that were reflected in classroom interaction generally.&lt;ref&gt;Orest P. Ochitwa [http://saskschoolboards.ca/research/school_improvement/rp27.htm A Study of the Organizational Climate of High and Low Adopter Elementary Schools in Saskatchewan], retrieved 16 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creativity and Its Cultivation ===
In 1957-1958 an Interdisciplinary Symposia on Creativity was held on the Michigan State University. Contributions were made by [[Erich Fromm]], [[Harold D. Lasswell]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Abraham Maslow]], R. May, [[Edmund Ware Sinnott]], Harold H. Anderson himself and others. Harold H. Anderson edited the symposium report with the main title: ''Creativity and its cultivation''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lccn.loc.gov/59007049 Creativity and its cultivation] content in Library of Congress, retrieved 16 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6192">'''Health in Israel''' is generally considered good.

Infant mortality is low.  Life expectancy, 82.1 years is high.  There is good management of chronic disease and excellent primary care.  Expenditure on healthcare is 7.2% of [[Gross Domestic Product]], compared with an average of 9.2% in the OECD.

There are high levels of smoking among [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab Israeli]] men, and high levels of obesity among Arab Israeli women. The overall rate of smoking among the entire population was just under 20% in 2014.

Israel has the second highest rate of skin cancer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obesity==
Obesity rates were below the average for [[OECD]] nations, with an obesity rate of 14% for adults in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.gov.il/English/News_and_Events/Spokespersons_Messages/Pages/23112011_2e.aspx OECD Health at a Glance 2011: Key findings for Israel] Israel Ministry of Health, www.health.gov.il, Publish Date:23/11/2011 11:15&lt;/ref&gt; Socioeconomic status was one factor that impacted overweight and obesity percentages, particularly for women. Women in lower classes were four times as likely to be overweight or obese as women in upper classes. Only 20.2% of the entire population reported that they exercise for twenty minutes or more three times a week.&lt;ref name="Kaluski"/&gt;

The frequency of exercise among the [[Israeli Jews|Jewish Israeli]] population was twice as high as that for the Arab population. Men and women of Arab descent are more likely to be of an unhealthy weight than Israeli men and women.&lt;ref name="Kaluski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaluski|first=D. Nitzan|title=Prevalence of Obesity in Israel|journal=Obesity Reviews|volume=6|issue=2|pages=115|doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2005.00168.x|pmid=15836461|year=2005|last2=Berry|first2=E. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smoking==
Smoking prevalence among males  remained relatively constant at 30%  in the years 1994–2004.&lt;ref name="Baron"&gt;Baron-Epel O. Haviv-Messika A. Tamir D. Nitzan-Kaluski D. Green M. Multiethnic differences in smoking in Israel: pooled analysis from three national surveys. European Journal of Public Health. 14(4):384-9, 2004 Dec.&lt;/ref&gt; Among females the prevalence declined slightly from 25% in 1998 to 18% in 2003.&lt;ref name="Baron"/&gt; For youth, 14% smoked at least once per week in a 2001 publication.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer B. Branski D. Kerem E. Ethnic differences in cigarette smoking among adolescents: a comparison of Jews and Arabs in Jerusalem. Israel Medical Association Journal: Imaj. 3(7):504-7, 2001 Jul.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Israeli youths have begun to use [[bidis]] and [[hookah]], as alternative methods of tobacco use.&lt;ref name="Baron"/&gt; In 1990, smoking was the cause of about 1,800 male deaths in Israel which was around 12% of all male deaths.&lt;ref name="CDCI"/&gt; Smoking has not been found to be significant cause of death among Israeli women.&lt;ref name="CDCI"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/WHO/israel.htm Tobacco or Health: A Global Status Report], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), accessed July 13, 2005 (site now down)&lt;/ref&gt; The average number of cigarettes smoked per [[Israelis|Israeli]] stands at 2162 (6).&lt;ref name="Baron"/&gt;

There are several [[anti-tobacco use legislation]]s in effect. For instance, advertising is prohibited in youth publications and is forbidden on television and radio.&lt;ref name="CDCI"/&gt; in addition to substantial increases in tobacco taxes, although comparatively the prices are still among the lowest compared to all of the European countries.&lt;ref name="CDCI"/&gt; Until 2004, there was no minimum age requirement for buying tobacco products in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/Document/E80607.pdf WHO European Country Profiles on Tobacco Control 2003], [[World Health Organization]], accessed November 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; however, an amendment to the tobacco marketing and advertisement law that became effective at 2004 has limited the sale of tobacco to people above the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moital.gov.il/NR/exeres/E13924CA-0B10-42C0-9F50-76F33C5E01CC.htm] [[Ministry of Economy (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Commerce and Industry]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]], the smoking rate in the Israeli adult population in 2009 was 20.9%, down from 34% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/HealthAndSci-Tech/Health/Article.aspx?id=181972&lt;/ref&gt; A Ministry of Health nationwide survey conducted in 2011 found that 20.6% of the population aged 21 and older were smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Record Number of Non-Smokers|url=http://health.walla.co.il/?w=/5059/2537905|accessdate=15 June 2012|newspaper=Walla|date=31 May 2012|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest percentage of smokers was among Arab males, 44% percent of whom smoked, though this figure is down from 50% in 1996.

In 2014 19.8% of adult Israelis smoked, 26.3% in the Arab population and 18.4% in the Jewish population. 35% of non-smoking respondents to the World Health Survey reported that they had been exposed to passive smoking.  Smoking is responsible for about 8,000 deaths in Israel every year, about 700 among passive smokers. The cost of the damage of smoking to the health system is estimated at [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]] 1.7 billion (about $440 million) a year.  The annual loss of working capacity and paid sick days in the wider economy is estimated at NIS 1.9 billion ($490 million). About NIS 8.2 billion ($2.12 billion) is spent on tobacco products each year.   40 tons of tobacco worth some NIS 24 million ($6.2 million) and about 1.3 million cigarette packs were intercepted at the border crossing between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=8,000 Israelis die of smoking every year|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4663271,00.html|accessdate=22 December 2015|publisher=Ynet News|date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson]] ([[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], 2008), in an article entitled ''Understanding the Employment Relation: The Analysis of Idiosyncratic Exchange''.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson O, Wachter M, Harris JE, Understanding the Employment Relation: The Analysis of Idiosyncratic Exchange. ''Bell Journal of Economics'' 1975; 6: 250-78.&lt;/ref&gt; This article (294 [[Web of Science]] (WoS) citations, 928 [[Google Scholar]] (GS) citations) was subsequently reproduced in several collections,&lt;ref&gt;Putterham L, ed., ''The Economic Nature of the Firm: A Reader''. Cambridge University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; including Williamson’s ''Markets and Hierarchies'' (1975).&lt;ref&gt;Williamson OE. ''Markets and Hierarchies: Analysis and Antitrust Implications, A Study in the Economics of Internal Organization''. Free Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The article has been described as "the first explicit application of the new institutional economics to internal labor markets."&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman BE, ed., ''Government Regulation of the Employment Relationship''. Cornell University Press, 1997, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Internal Organization of Hospitals (1977) ===
Based upon Harris' training in the economics of organization and his experiences as a medical resident, this article (149 WoS citations, 411 GS citations)&lt;ref name="BJE-1977" /&gt; has been listed as one of the top articles in the last four decades of scholarship in health economics.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff A, [[Anthony J. Culyer|Culyer AJ]], Four decades of health economics through a bibliometric lens. ''Journal of Health Economics'' 2012; 31:406-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Reproduced in several collections,&lt;ref&gt;Luke RD, Bauer JC, eds., ''Issues in Health Economics'', Aspen Systems Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kovner AR, Neuhauser D, eds., ''Health Services Management: Readings and Commentary'', 3rd edition. Health Administration Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; the article was cited in the first generation of health economics textbooks as the Harris Model: "The hospital, under Harris' account, is the scene of continual conflict within an organization inherently split into two parts, what Harris describes as a noncooperative oligopoly game."&lt;ref&gt;Folland S, Goodman AC, Stano M, ''The Economics of Health and Health Care'', 1st edition. Macmillan, 1993. See "The Harris Model," pp. 369-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DuMouchel-Harris (1983) ===
Based upon his participation in the [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHMrAAAAYAAJ Diesel Impacts Study Committee] of the [[National Academy of Sciences]], Harris collaborated with William H. DuMouchel in an article entitled ''Bayes Methods for Combining the Results of Cancer Studies in Humans and Other Species'' (181 WoS citations, 228 GS citations).&lt;ref name="JASA-1983" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also discussed in: Berry DA, [[Dalene Stangl|Stangl D.]] ''Bayesian Biostatistics''. Marcel Dekker, 1996; Stangl DK and Berry DA. eds. ''Meta Analysis in Medicine and Health Policy''.

Princeton University Press, 2013; Gelman A, Carlin JB, Stern HS, Dunson DB, Vehtari A, Rubin DB. Bayesian Data Analysis, 3rd Edition, CRC Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As recounted by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne in ''The Theory That Would Not Die'',&lt;ref&gt;McGrayne SB, ''The Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes' Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy''. Yale University Press, 2012. pp. 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt; "Several civilian researchers tackling hitherto intractable problems concerning public health, sociology, epidemiology, and image restoration did experiment during the 1980s with computers for Bayes. A major controversy about the effect of diesel engine emissions on air quality and cancer inspired the first attempt. By the 1980s cancer specialists had solid data about the effects of cigarette smoke on people, laboratory animals, and cells but little accurate information about diesel fumes. William H. DuMouchel from MIT’s mathematics department and Jeffrey E. Harris from its economics department and Massachusetts General Hospital teamed up in 1983 to ask, 'Could you borrow and extrapolate and take advantage of information from non-human species for humans?' ... Thanks to mice and hamster studies, DuMouchel and Harris were able to conclude that even if light-duty diesel vehicles captured a 25% market share over 20 years, the risk of lung cancer would be negligible for the typical urban resident compared to the typical pack-a-day cigarette smoker. ... Today, Bayesian meta-analyses are statistically old hat, but DuMouchel and Harris made Bayesians salivate for more big-data methods—and for the computing power to deal with them."

=== Cigarette Smoking among Successive Birth Cohorts (1983) ===
Motivated by his contributions to the 1979 and 1980 [http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/ Surgeon General’s Reports], Harris developed a method to reconstruct the smoking rates of successive birth cohorts of men and women throughout the 20th century, based upon individual smoking histories reported in large-scale cross-section surveys. The resulting article, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 1983 (148 Wos citations, 210 GS citations),&lt;ref name="JNCI-1983" /&gt; spawned a series of studies tracking the birth cohort-specific relationships between smoking rates and disease incidence.&lt;ref&gt;Burns DM, Lee L, Shen LZ, Gilpin E, Tolley HD, Vaughn J, Shanks TG, Cigarette smoking behavior in the United States, Chapter 2 in Shopland D, Burns DM, Garfinkel L, Samet J, eds., ''Changes in Cigarette-Related Disease Risks and Their Implications for Prevention and Control. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 8''. National Cancer Institute, Bethesda MD, Feb. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Improved Short-Term Survival from AIDS (1990) ===
In an article entitled ''Improved Short-Term Survival of AIDS Patients Initially Diagnosed with Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia, 1984 through 1987'' (101 WoS citations, 131 GS citations),&lt;ref name="JAMA-1990" /&gt; Harris was one of the first investigators to report a significant gain in life expectancy for AIDS patients, which he attributed to the introduction in 1986 of [[zidovudine]], the first antiretroviral agent.

=== Risk of Lung Cancer from Low Tar Cigarettes (2004) ===
Harris collaborated with Dr. [[Michael Thun]] and his colleagues at the [[American Cancer Society]] to study the relationship between cigarette tar yield and the risk of cancer in the Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II) cohort (57 WoS citations, 136 GS citations, 36,000 [http://www.bmj.com/content/328/7431/72/article-info downloads] from British Medical Journal website).&lt;ref name="Harris-Thun" /&gt; This prospective cohort study of over 900,000 men and women remains the standard citation for the conclusion that, while cigarette smoking increases the risk of lung cancer compared to nonsmokers, there is no difference in lung cancer risk between those who smoke medium tar cigarettes, low tar cigarettes and very low tar cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;Ridge CA, McErlean AM, Ginsberg MS. Epidemiology of lung cancer. Seminars in Interventional Radiology 2013; 30(2):93-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he gave expert testimony in [[s:Price v. Philip Morris, Inc.|''Price v. Philip Morris'']], a class-action lawsuit alleging fraud in the marketing and sale concerning light cigarettes, in which the trial court entered a $10.1 billion judgment against the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;Although the judgment was vacated by the Illinois Supreme Court in 2005, the case has been recently revived and is currently [http://www.state.il.us/court/Opinions/AppellateCourt/2014/5thDistrict/5130017.pdf pending appeal].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he gave [http://www.justice.gov/civil/cases/tobacco2/Writtend%20Direct%20of%20Dr.%20Jeffrey%20E.%20Harris.pdf expert testimony] in ''United States v.

Harris has offered expert testimony in numerous other cases involving the [http://web.mit.edu/jeffrey/harris/testimony.html tobacco and pharmaceutical industries].

=== Cipollone v. Liggett (1988) ===
Harris’ role as an expert witness at trial in [[Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.|Cipollone v. Liggett]], the first lawsuit in which a jury held the tobacco industry responsible for an individual smoker’s death, has been subject to numerous reviews. As recounted by [[Richard Kluger]] in his [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''Ashes to Ashes'':&lt;ref&gt;Kluger R, ''Ashes to Ashes: America's Hundred-Year Cigarette War, the Public Health, and the Unabashed Triumph of Philip Morris'', Alfred A. Knopf, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; "Harris tellingly contrasted the tobacco companies' conduct with that of the canning industry, which had adopted new sterilizing methods when botulism was traced to its careless procedures, and the pharmaceutical industry, which had put a skull-and-crossbones warning on preparations found to be toxic when ingested. Such measures were in marked contrast to the conduct of Philip Morris, Harris said, which in the 'Thirties had introduced the humectant [[diethylene glycol]]-- a compound later found to be harmful to the kidneys-- based on a minimum of testing..." Harris' unpublished [http://web.mit.edu/jeffrey/harris/Cipollone_State-of-the-Art_Rept_01-Aug-1985.pdf ''Expert Report on the State of the Art''], which was submitted in the Cipollone litigation, itself spawned an inquiry into the role of historians as experts in tobacco-related litigation.&lt;ref&gt;Proctor RN, "Everyone knew but no one had proof”: tobacco industry use of medical history expertise in US courts, 1990–2002. ''Tobacco Control'' 2006; 15(Suppl. 4): iv117-iv125.&lt;/ref&gt; As recounted by Robert Proctor in ''Golden Holocaust'',&lt;ref&gt;Proctor, RN. Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2011. pp. 426-27.&lt;/ref&gt; "In a memo titled 'Witness Development,' Arnold &amp; Porter's Janet L. Johnson emphasized to STIC's State-of-the-Art Subcomittee their need to develop a 'storyteller' to tell 'our version' of the history of the recognition of tobacco hazards. Jeffrey Harris's expert report for Cipollone had presented a detailed chronicle of the discovery of lung cancer hazard, identifying evidence from the 1930's and the strong case for proof by 1957. The industry wanted to counter the testimony without having to address when a link had actually been established. 'Instead of trying to defend the issue of whether and when a link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer was established, we should consider focusing our testimony on defending 1954, attacking Harris' 1957 date on which a link was 'proven,' and demonstrate that it was not proven in 1957 with post-57 statements by medical experts about the existence of a controversy'."

== Hispanic Collaborations ==

Haldane]. dmm.org.uk. 16 March 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and family ==
Haldane was born in [[Edinburgh]] to Robert Haldane, whose father was Scottish evangelist [[James Alexander Haldane]], and Mary Elizabeth Burdon-Sanderson, daughter of Richard Burdon-Sanderson and the granddaughter of Sir Thomas Burdon. His maternal uncle was the physiologist [[John Scott Burdon-Sanderson]]. He was the brother of [[Elizabeth Haldane]], [[William Stowell Haldane]] and [[Richard Burdon Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane]].

Haldane attended [[Edinburgh Academy]], [[Edinburgh University]] and the [[Friedrich Schiller University of Jena]]. He graduated in medicine from [[Edinburgh University Medical School]] in 1884.

On 12 December 1891 he married Louisa Kathleen Coutts Trotter (1863–1961),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Addison, Henry Robert|author2=Oakes, Charles Henry|author3=Lawson, William John|author4=Sladen, Douglas Brooke Wheelton|title=HALDANE, John Scott|journal=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=757|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA757}}&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of Coutts Trotter FRGS and Harriet Augusta Keatinge.&lt;ref&gt;Daughter of The Right Hon Richard Keatinge PC KC (1793-1876)&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children: the scientist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and the author [[Naomi Mitchison]].

==Career==

Haldane was Gifford Lecturer in the [[University of Glasgow]], Fellow of [[New College, Oxford]], from October 1901,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence|day_of_week=Thursday |date=17 October 1901 |page_number=4 |issue=36588| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Honorary Professor of the [[University of Birmingham]]. Haldane received numerous honorary degrees. He was also President of the English Institution of Mining Engineers, a Companion of Honor of the British Court, a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/about-us/fellowship/Fellows1660-2007.pdf|title=Lists of Royal Society Fellows 1660–2007|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=21 July 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a member of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] and of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]].

Haldane died in [[Oxford]] at midnight on the night of 14 March/15 March 1936. He had just returned from a trip he had undertaken to investigate cases of [[heat stroke]] in the oil refineries in [[Persia]].

Sir [[Henry Newbolt]] wrote a poem called "For J. S. Haldane", published in his anthology "A Perpetual Memory and other Poems" in 1939.

==Accomplishments==
Haldane was an international authority on [[ether]] and [[Respiratory system|respiration]] and the inventor of the [[Black Veil Respirator]], or early gas mask, during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=acott/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sciences and Philosophy: Gifford Lectures, University of Glasgow, 1927–28'' by J.S. Haldane, Doubleday, Doran and Co., Inc., Garden City, NY, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haldane helped determine the regulation of breathing, and discovered the [[Haldane effect]] in [[haemoglobin]]. He was the founder of ''[[The Journal of Hygiene]]''. In 1907 Haldane made a [[decompression chamber]] to help make deep-sea divers safer and produced the first [[decompression tables]] after extensive experiments with animals.&lt;ref name=acott/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boycott |first=A. E. |author2=G. C. C. Damant, J. S. Haldane. |title=Prevention of compressed air illness |journal=J. Hygiene |volume=8 |issue=03 |pages=342–443 |year=1908 |doi=10.1017/S0022172400003399 |pmc=2167126 |pmid=20474365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{The Timetables of Science|pages=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an authority on the effects of [[pulmonary diseases]], such as [[silicosis]] caused by inhaling [[silica]] dust. After being forced out of combatting poison gases in World War I, through alleged German sympathies, he shifted into working with victims of [[gas warfare]] and developed oxygen treatment including the [[oxygen tent]].

==Coal and metal mines==

[[File:Mine safety lamp.jpg|thumb|Modern flame safety lamp used in mines, manufactured by Koehler]]
He investigated the principle of action of many different gases. He investigated numerous [[mine disaster]]s, especially the toxic gases which killed most miners after [[firedamp]] and [[coal dust]] explosions. The toxic mixtures of gases found in mines included [[afterdamp]], [[blackdamp]] and [[whitedamp]]. His description of the way a flame [[safety lamp]] can be used to detect firedamp by the increase in height of the flame, and [[chokedamp]] by the dying of the flame, is a classic exposition in his textbook, ''Respiration''. Although [[electronic gas detector]]s are now used widely in all coal mines, flame lamps are still used extensively for their ease and simplicity of operation. Electronic gas detectors rely on a catalytic chip which can be poisoned by atmospheric impurities.

He identified [[carbon monoxide]] as the lethal constituent of afterdamp, the gas created by [[combustion]], after examining many bodies of miners killed in pit explosions. Their skin was coloured cherry-pink from [[carboxyhaemoglobin]], the stable compound formed in the blood by reaction with the gas. It effectively displaces oxygen, and so the victim dies of [[asphyxia]]. As a result of his research, he was able to design respirators for rescue workers. He tested the effect of carbon monoxide on his own body in a closed chamber, describing the results of his slow poisoning. In the late 1890s, he introduced the use of small animals for miners to detect dangerous levels of carbon monoxide underground, either white mice or canaries. With a faster metabolism, they showed the effects of poisoning before gas levels became critical for the workers, and so gave an early warning of the problem. The [[Domestic Canary|canary]] in British pits was replaced in 1986 by the electronic [[gas detector]].

==Pike's peak expedition==
[[Image:Pikes Peak.jpg|thumb|270px|Pike's Peak as seen from within [[Manitou Springs, Colorado]].]]
Haldane pioneered study of the reaction of the body to low air pressures, such as that experienced at high altitudes. He led an expedition to [[Pike's Peak]] in 1911, which examined the effect of low atmospheric pressure on respiration.

In addition to his work on mine atmospheres, he investigated the air in enclosed spaces such as wells and sewers. One surprising result of his analysis of the air in the sewers beneath the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was to show that the level of bacterial contamination was relatively low. During this research, he investigated fatalities of workmen in a sewer, and showed that [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas was the culprit.

'''John Snow''' (15 March 1813 – 16 June 1858&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=John Snow |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Snow-British-physician |accessdate=2018-03-12 |date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English physician and a leader in the adoption of [[anaesthesia]] and medical [[hygiene]]. He is considered one of the fathers of modern [[epidemiology]], in part because of his work in tracing the source of a [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|cholera outbreak in Soho, London, in 1854]].  His findings inspired fundamental changes in the water and [[sewage treatment|waste systems]] of London, which led to similar changes in other cities, and a significant improvement in general [[public health]] around the world.

== Early life and education ==
Snow was born on 15 March 1813 in [[York]], England, the first of nine children born to William and Frances Snow in their North Street home, and was baptised at [[All Saints' Church, North Street, York]]. His father was a labourer&lt;ref&gt;Wedding Record of William Snow and Frances Empson, Huntington All Saints, 24/05/1812&lt;/ref&gt; who worked at a local coal yard, by the Ouse, constantly replenished from the Yorkshire coalfield by barges, but later was a farmer in a small village to the north of York.&lt;ref&gt;Census 1841&lt;/ref&gt;

The neighbourhood was one of the poorest in the city, and was frequently in danger of flooding because of its proximity to the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]]. Growing up, Snow experienced unsanitary conditions and contamination in his hometown. Most of the streets were unsanitary and the river was contaminated by runoff water from market squares, cemeteries and sewage.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|pmc=1325279|title=John Snow, MD: anaesthetist to the Queen of England and pioneer epidemiologist|last=Ramsay|first=Michael A.E.|date=January 6, 2009|website=US National Library of Medicine NIH|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:allsaintsnorthstreetyork.jpg|thumb|left| All Saints, North Street, York]]

From a young age, Snow demonstrated an aptitude for mathematics. In 1827, when he was 14, he obtained a medical apprenticeship with William Hardcastle in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]]. In 1832, during his time as a surgeon-apothecary apprentice, he encountered a cholera epidemic for the first time in [[Killingworth]], a coal-mining village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Laura|year=2009|title=Cholera and the Pump on Broad Street: The Life and Legacy of John Snow|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snow treated many victims of the disease and gained a lot of experience. Additionally, while he was an apprentice, Snow could not drink, gamble or marry. Eventually he adjusted to [[teetotalism]] and led a life characterized by abstinence, signing an abstinence pledge in 1835. Snow was also a vegetarian and tried to only drink distilled water that was “pure”.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Between 1833 and 1836 Snow worked as an assistant to a [[colliery]] surgeon, first in [[Burnopfield]], County Durham, and then in [[Pateley Bridge]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. In October 1836 he enrolled at the [[John Hunter (surgeon)|Hunterian school of medicine]] on [[Great Windmill Street]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, KB. John Snow. In: ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography''. Vol 12. New York, NY: Charles Scribner's Sons; 1973:502–503.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1837, Snow began working at the [[Westminster Hospital]]. Admitted as a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] on 2 May 1838, he graduated from the [[University of London]] in December 1844 and was admitted to the [[Royal College of Physicians]] in 1850. In 1850 he was also one of the founding members of the [[Epidemiological Society of London]], formed in response to the cholera outbreak of 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/LESociety.html|title=London Epidemiology Society|publisher= UCLA|accessdate = 22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857, Snow made an early and often overlooked&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dunnigan | first1 = M. | title = Commentary: John Snow and alum-induced rickets from adulterated London bread: an overlooked contribution to metabolic bone disease | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyg160 | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 340–1 | year = 2003 | pmid =  12777415| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; contribution to epidemiology in a pamphlet, ''On the adulteration of bread as a cause of [[rickets]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)21130-7| title = On the Adulteration of Bread As a Cause of Rickets| journal = The Lancet| volume = 70| issue = 1766| pages = 4| year = 1857| last1 = Snow | first1 = J. }}&lt;br /&gt; Reedited in {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyg153|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/injepidemiology32_336_337_2003.pdf| pmid = 12777413| title = On the adulteration of bread as a cause of rickets| journal = International Journal of Epidemiology| volume = 32| issue = 3| pages = 336–7| year = 2003| last1 = Snow | first1 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anaesthesia ==
John Snow was one of the first physicians to study and calculate dosages for the use of [[Diethyl ether|ether]] and [[chloroform]] as surgical [[anaesthetic]]s, allowing patients to undergo surgical and [[obstetrics|obstetric]] procedures without the distress and pain they would otherwise experience. He designed the apparatus to safely administer ether to the patients and also designed a mask to administer chloroform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/johnsnow.aspx John Snow (1813–58)]. sciencemuseum.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; He personally administered chloroform to [[Queen Victoria]] when she gave birth to the last two of her nine children, [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany|Leopold]] in 1853 and [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Beatrice]] in 1857,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anesthesia and Queen Victoria|work=John Snow|publisher=Department of Epidemiology [[UCLA School of Public Health]]|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/victoria.html|accessdate=21 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to wider public acceptance of obstetric anaesthesia. Snow published an article on ether in 1847 entitled ''On the Inhalation of the Vapor of Ether''.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, John (1847) [http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/oninhalationvapourether.pdf On the Inhalation of the Vapor of Ether]. ph.ucla.edu&lt;/ref&gt;  A longer version entitled ''On Chloroform and Other Anaesthetics and Their Action and Administration'' was published posthumously in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, John (1858) [https://archive.org/details/onchloroformothe1858snow On Chloroform and Other Anaesthetics and Their Action and Administration]. London: John Churchill&lt;/ref&gt;

After finishing his medical studies in the [[University of London]], he earned his MD in 1844. Snow set up his practice at 54 Frith Street in Soho as a surgeon and general practitioner. John Snow contributed to a wide range of medical concerns including [[anaesthesiology]]. He was a member of the [[Westminster Medical Society]], an organisation dedicated to clinical and scientific demonstrations. Snow gained prestige and recognition all the while being able to experiment and pursue many of his scientific ideas. He was a speaker multiple times at the society’s meetings and he also wrote and published articles. He was especially interested on patients with respiratory diseases and tested his hypothesis through animal studies. In 1841, he wrote, ''On Asphyxiation, and on the Resuscitation of Still-Born Children'', which is an article that discusses his discoveries on the physiology of neonatal respiration, oxygen consumption and the effects of body temperature change.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/article.aspx?articleid=1945835#81074985|title=John Snow’s Practice of Obstetric Anesthesia|last=Caton|first=Donald|date=January 2000|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, his interest in anaesthesia and breathing was evident since 1841 and beginning in 1843, Snow experimented with ether to see its effects on respiration.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Only a year after ether was introduced to Britain, in 1847, he published a short work titled, ''On the Inhalation of the Vapor of Ether,'' which served as a guide for its use. At the same time, he worked on various papers that reported his clinical experience with anaesthesia, noting reactions, procedures and experiments.

Though he thoroughly worked with [[ether]] as an anaesthetic, he never attempted to patent it; instead he continued to work and publish written works on his observations and research. Within two years after ether was introduced, Snow was the most accomplished anaesthetist in Britain. London’s principal surgeons suddenly wanted his assistance.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

John Snow also studied [[chloroform]], as much as he studied ether, which was introduced in 1847 by [[James Young Simpson]], a Scottish obstetrician. He realised that chloroform was much more potent and required more attention and precision when administering it. Snow first realised this with Hannah Greener, a 15-year-old patient, who died on 28 January 1848 after a surgical procedure that required the cutting of her toenail. She was administered chloroform by covering her face with a cloth dipped in the substance. However, she quickly lost pulse and died. After investigating her death and a couple of deaths that followed, he realized that chloroform had to be administered carefully and published his findings in a letter to ''The Lancet''.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

=== Obstetric anaesthesia ===
Snow’s work and findings were related to both anaesthesia and the practice of childbirth. His experience with [[Obstetrics|obstetric]] patients was extensive and used different substances including ether, amylene and chloroform to treat his patients. However, chloroform was the easiest drug to administer. He treated 77 obstetric patients with chloroform. He would apply the chloroform at the second stage of labour and controlled the amount without completely putting the patients to sleep. Once the patient was delivering the baby they would only feel the first half of the contraction and be on the border of unconsciousness but not fully there. Regarding administration of the anaesthetic, Snow believed that it would be safer if another person that was not the surgeon applied it.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

The use of chloroform as an anaesthetic for childbirth was seen as unethical by many physicians and even the [[Church of England]]. However, on 7 April 1853, [[Queen Victoria]] asked John Snow to administer chloroform during the delivery of her eighth child. He then repeated the procedure for the delivery of her daughter, three years later. Medical and religious acceptance of obstetrical anaesthesia came after in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

== Cholera ==
{{Main|1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak}}
[[File:Chol an.gif|thumb|300px|choléra|Map of a later cholera outbreak in London, in 1866]][[File:Choleramaplondon1866.png|thumb|right|300px|Legend for the map above]]
Snow was a skeptic of the then-dominant [[miasma theory]] that stated that diseases such as cholera and [[bubonic plague]] were caused by pollution or a noxious form of "bad air". The [[germ theory of disease]] had not yet been developed, so Snow did not understand the mechanism by which the disease was transmitted. His observation of the evidence led him to discount the theory of foul air. He first publicised his theory in an 1849 essay, ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last=Snow | first=John | author-link=John Snow | year=1849 | title=On the Mode of Communication of Cholera | place=London | publisher=John Churchill | url=https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/ext/cholera/PDF/0050707.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a more detailed treatise in 1855 incorporating the results of his investigation of the role of the water supply in the [[Soho]] epidemic of 1854.&lt;ref name="Snow 1855"&gt;{{ cite book | last=Snow | first=John | author-link=John Snow | year=1855 | title=On the Mode of Communication of Cholera | edition=2nd | place=London | publisher=John Churchill | url=https://archive.org/stream/b28985266#page/n3/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1= Gunn, S. William A.|author2=Masellis, Michele |title=Concepts and Practice of Humanitarian Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1exE1cfKXIC&amp;pg=PA87|date=23 October 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-72264-1|pages=87–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By talking to local residents (with the help of [[Reverend Henry Whitehead]]), he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now [[Broadwick Street]]). Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the [[Broad Street pump]] did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle ([[Hand pump#Types|force rod]]). This action has been commonly credited as ending the outbreak, but Snow observed that the epidemic may have already been in rapid decline:

{{quote|There is no doubt that the mortality was much diminished, as I said before, by the flight of the population, which commenced soon after the outbreak; but the attacks had so far diminished before the use of the water was stopped, that it is impossible to decide whether the well still contained the cholera poison in an active state, or whether, from some cause, the water had become free from it.&lt;ref name="Snow 1855" /&gt;{{rp|51–52}}}}

[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Original map by John Snow showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854, drawn and lithographed by [[Charles Cheffins]].]]
Snow later used a [[dot distribution map|dot map]] to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump. He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. He showed that the [[Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company]] was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the [[Thames]] and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is regarded as the founding event of the science of [[epidemiology]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Snow wrote:
{{quote|On proceeding to the spot, I found that nearly all the deaths had taken place within a short distance of the [Broad Street] pump. There were only ten deaths in houses situated decidedly nearer to another street-pump. In five of these cases the families of the deceased persons informed me that they always sent to the pump in Broad Street, as they preferred the water to that of the pumps which were nearer. In three other cases, the deceased were children who went to school near the pump in Broad Street...

With regard to the deaths occurring in the locality belonging to the pump, there were 61 instances in which I was informed that the deceased persons used to drink the pump water from Broad Street, either constantly or occasionally...

The result of the inquiry, then, is, that there has been no particular outbreak or prevalence of cholera in this part of London except among the persons who were in the habit of drinking the water of the above-mentioned pump well.

I had an interview with the Board of Guardians of St James's parish, on the evening of the 7th inst [7 September], and represented the above circumstances to them. In consequence of what I said, the handle of the pump was removed on the following day.|John Snow|letter to the editor of the ''Medical Times and Gazette''{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}}}

[[File:John Snow memorial and pub.jpg|thumb|John Snow memorial and public house on [[Broadwick Street]], [[Soho]]]]
Researchers later discovered that this public well had been dug only {{convert|3|ft|m|sigfig=1}} from an old [[cesspit]], which had begun to leak faecal bacteria. The cloth nappy of a baby, who had contracted cholera from another source, had been washed into this cesspit. Its opening was originally under a nearby house, which had been rebuilt farther away after a fire. The city had widened the street and the cesspit was lost. It was common at the time to have a cesspit under most homes. Most families tried to have their raw sewage collected and dumped in the Thames to prevent their cesspit from filling faster than the sewage could decompose into the soil.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

[[Thomas Shapter]] had conducted similar studies and used a point-based map for the study of cholera in [[Exeter]], seven years before John Snow, although this did not identify the water supply problem that was later held responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shapter|first1=Thomas|title=The History of the Cholera in Exeter in 1832|date=1849|publisher=John Churchill|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political controversy ===
After the cholera epidemic had subsided, government officials replaced the Broad Street pump handle. They had responded only to the urgent threat posed to the population, and afterward they rejected Snow's theory. To accept his proposal would have meant indirectly accepting the fecal-oral route of disease transmission, which was too unpleasant for most of the public to contemplate.&lt;ref&gt;Chapelle, Frank  (2005) ''Wellsprings''. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press. {{ISBN|0-8135-3614-6}}. p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

It wasn't until 1866 that [[William Farr]], one of Snow's chief opponents, realized the validity of his diagnosis when investigating another outbreak of cholera at [[Bromley by Bow]] and issued immediate orders that unboiled water was not to be drunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cadbury|first=Deborah|title=Seven Wonders of the Industrial World|year=2003|accessdate=|publisher=Fourth Estate|location=London and New York|pages= 189–192|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farr denied Snow's explanation of how exactly the contaminated water spread cholera, although he did accept that water had a role in the spread of the illness. In fact, some of the statistical data that Farr collected helped promote John Snow's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Eyler | first = John M.| date = April 1973| title = William Farr on the Cholera: The Sanitarian's Disease Theory and the Statistician's Method| url = | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine| doi = | pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public health officials recognise the political struggles in which reformers have often become entangled.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, L.J. and Donaldson, R.J. (2005) ''Essential Public Health''. Radcliffe Publishing. {{ISBN|1-900603-87-X}}. p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; During the Annual Pumphandle Lecture in England, members of the John Snow Society remove and replace a pump handle to symbolise the continuing challenges for advances in public health.&lt;ref name="Lecture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnsnowsociety.org/annual-pumphandle-lecture.html|title=Pumphandle Lectures|work=johnsnowsociety.org|publisher=The John Snow Society|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
In 1830 Snow became a member of the [[Temperance Movement]], and lived for a decade or so as a vegetarian and [[teetotaler]]. In the mid-1840s his health deteriorated, and he returned to meat-eating and drinking wine. He continued drinking pure water (via boiling) throughout his adult life. He never married.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Stephanie J. (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25979 "Snow, John (1813–1858)"] in ''Oxford Dictionary of Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow lived at 18 [[Sackville Street (London)|Sackville Street]], London, from 1852 to his death in 1858.&lt;ref name=UCLA&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/phototour1.html ''JOHN SNOW'S HOMES''.] UCLA Department of Epidemiology, 2014. Retrieved 6 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow suffered a stroke while working in his London office on 10 June 1858. He was 45 years old at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Steven|title=The Ghost Map|publisher=[[Riverhead Books]]|year=2006|isbn=1-59448-925-4|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never recovered, dying on 16 June 1858. He was buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of notable occupants |work=Brompton Cemetery |url=http://www.brompton.org/Residents.htm |format=[[HTTP]] |accessdate=21 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823091118/http://www.brompton.org/Residents.htm |archivedate=23 August 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kramatorsk radiological accident''' was a [[list of civilian radiation accidents|radiation accident]] that happened in [[Kramatorsk]], [[Ukrainian SSR]] from 1980 to 1989. In 1989, a small capsule containing highly radioactive [[caesium-137]] was found inside the concrete wall of an apartment building, with a surface gamma radiation exposure dose rate of 1800&amp;nbsp;[[Roentgen (unit)|R]]/year.&lt;ref&gt;Gusev, Igor, Guskova, Angelina, &amp; Mettler, Fred A. (Eds.). (2001). Medical management of radiation accidents. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the source, originally a part of a measurement device (most likely a level meter), was lost in the late 1970s and ended up mixed with material used to construct the building in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntc.kiev.ua/download/arh/BTN/8.pdf|title=Security and Nonproliferation, Issue 2(8)2005, Kyiv, 2005|accessdate=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 9 years, two families lived in the apartment. By the time the capsule was discovered, 6 residents of the building had died from [[leukemia]] and 17 more had received varying doses of radiation. The accident was detected only after the residents requested that the level of radiation be measured in the apartment by a [[health physics|health physicist]].

The address where the accident occurred is Gvardeytsiv Kantemirovtsiv Street, Building 7, Apartment 85, between apartments 85 and 52.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irpa11.irpa.net/pdfs/7c20.pdf|title=Early Medical Consequences of Radiation Incidents in the Former URRS Territory|accessdate=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Larnaca 01-2017 img05 Kyriazis Medical Museum.jpg|thumb|230px|Kyriazis Medical Museum occupies the ground floor.]]
The '''Kyriazis Medical Museum''' in [[Larnaca]], Cyprus was established in 2011.&lt;ref name=established&gt;Politis newspaper 19 October 2011, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;  It displays medical items, books, and framed documents relating to the practice of Cypriot medicine and the [[history of medicine in Cyprus]], from antiquity to the 20th century. It is sometimes referred to as a Medical Museum—the only one in Cyprus.&lt;ref name="established"/&gt;

A sign on the facade says: "Larnaka Cultural Walk - '''Kyriazis Medical Museum''' - A unique in its kind museum in Cyprus which presents the medical, healing and health history of the island." It is located on Karaolis and Dimitriou Street. It is open on Wednesdays and Saturdays from 9 AM to 12.30. Entrance is free.

The Museum organises cultural events, lectures for the public and activities with medical interest. It also functions as a 'health hangout' for healthcare professionals and the general public alike.

== History ==
It was opened by Cyprus Health Minister [[Stavros Malas]] in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Philelephtheros newspaper, 15 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Its founder is [[Marios Kyriazis]],&lt;ref&gt;Prima Scala magazine, p. 44 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; a descendant of four generations of doctors and pharmacists in Larnaca. It is housed in a traditional restored and listed town mansion, donated by Kyriazis.&lt;ref&gt;Iatrikos Kosmos, Journal of the Cyprus medical Association February 2012, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Kyriazis has donated items including items and books inherited from his grandfather [[Neoclis Kyriazis]] (1878–1956) and from his great grandfather Antonios Tsepis (1843–1905) both of whom practiced in Larnaca. The collections of the museum begun in 1990 but due to lack of suitable space the items remained stored, although occasionally, these were exhibited within other medical or historical exhibitions.
[[File:kmm2.jpg|thumb|The entrance hall]]

== Exhibits ==
Documents with old Cypriot poems and [[curse]]s with medical content,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cyprushighlights.com/en/index.php/page/44/&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of virtually forgotten sayings and poems with medical slant of [[Byzantian]], [[Franks|Frankish]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] or [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] origins are exhibited on walls. The sayings and poems were shaped by a history of lack of medical facilities, inadequate treatments and absence of health prevention.

=== The Hall ===
The walls of the main entrance hall (Iliakos) are lined with framed pictures displaying the history of medicine from antiquity, through the Middle Ages and early 1800s. Examples include depictions of operations without anaesthetic, treatment of cholera or the plague, and treatments in monasteries.

=== Room 1 ===
This is the first room encountered on the left of the main entrance. There are Pharmacist’s cupboards displaying original bottles, tablets, injections, and doctor’s prescriptions. Items include a bullet extractor and a spring-loaded device for [[physiotherapy]] of muscles in the hand (where each finger's movement—of a hand that is closing—is counteracted by the force of separate springs, as the springs are stretched). Among other exhibits are a phallic item believed to have been used in the treatment of female hysteria in ancient times, and a rare find: oil from the Larnaka salt lake which was used in skin wounds and insect bites. In this room there is also a display of many old traditional Cypriot poems or sayings with medical content.

=== Room 2 ===
An [[X-ray machine]],  an electronic [[EKG]] measuring instrument, an ob/gynaecological bench and a surgical table are among exhibits in room two. The display information on the gynaecological bench states that it was used by nearly half of the original population of Larnaka. There is also a pharmacist’s display unit with several medical items from the 1850s including cupping material, leeches, a tonsil extractor, a Victorian magneto-electric device and cautery items.
[[File:One of the rooms- surgical theatre.jpg|thumb|Surgical equipment.]]

=== Room 3 ===
Although there are several medical and pharmaceutical items exhibited, this room is served mainly as a study/research facility. A medical library with books in Greek, Cypriot, French and English is available to students or academic researchers. A pharmaceutical display unit contains items for making hand-made pills.

=== Room 4 ===
Original surgical amputation instruments and a [[wikt:trough|trough]] with wood [[shaving]]s (to absorb blood) with a mock amputated hand are among exhibits in room four. There is a replica of the Hippocratic Ladder, a wooden ladder used to treat dislocations of the hip or of the neck. The injured leg was pulled by a ceramic pot full of stones or water.  A medical partition donated by the old Larnaca Hospital serves as a poster display unit with medical cartoons or information about traditional Cypriot therapies. Other items include a doctor's examination couch and equipment for treating tuberculosis.

Books are in all the four rooms. On request, permission to manipulate exhibits can be informally granted.

=== Garden ===
The garden is a traditional urban residential area where meetings or public events are being held. There is a collection of some Cypriot healing herbs such as mint, basil, lavender, sage, melissa and marjoram. The garden is accessible to the public, as this is used also as a health hub, where herbal and other health drinks are served. A covered area has a further display facility where outdoors exhibitions have taken place.

== Architecture ==
The museum has a neoclassic-type façade with blue window shutters, high ceilings, wooden floors in the rooms, and the obligatory decorated ceramic pattern in the ‘iliakos’ floor complete the picture.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Chrysanthou, Sunjet magazine, Cyprus Airways June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The house used to be a private residence, but the street where the museum is located had an unusually high number of doctors, nurses or pharmacists living there. Approximately 50% of all local residents had a medical connection.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cyprus.gov.cy/MOI/pio/pio.nsf/All/C6505F7E24C4E54DC2257A6A00305199/$file/CyprusToday_12_Small.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy of its management ==
The aim is to safeguard the medical cultural heritage of Cyprus for future generations of medical scientists and to identify facts of sociological, scientific, medical or literary interest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.larnakaregion.com/listing_info.php?id=596&lt;/ref&gt; The museum aims to reach any member of the public, of any age, and to facilitate exchange of information, learning and discussion on current health practices based on the past.

== Notable Events ==
The Medical Museum has organised the following cultural events:

April 2012: ‘Strange Traditional Cypriot Treatments’, under the auspices of the Mayor of Larnaca, also broadcast on [[Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation]] channel 1&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cybc-media.com/video/index.php/video-on-demand?task=play&amp;id=6515&amp;sl=cats&lt;/ref&gt;

September 2013: ‘World Tourism Day’ events and practical demonstrations

May 2013: ‘2000 years from the death of [[Apollonios of Kition]]’ under the auspices of the Cyprus Health Minister. This event included Ancient Greek wrestling ([[Pankration]]), medical theatre and presentations.

12 September 2013: Exhibition of medical cartoons, under the auspices of the Mayor of Larnaca.

26 September 2013: ‘Medical Saints of Cyprus’ under the auspices of the Bishop of Kition. Presentations from Kalogera Primary School students and other lectures.

22 May 2014: An evening of Cypriot medicine, in association with the Larnaca Doctors Association, and the Larnaca Municipality.

== Ongoing research projects ==
Three main research projects are currently being undertaken:

1. A compilation of a Cypriot medical dictionary. The aim is to collect and publish all Cypriot words with a medical meaning. Several interested parties are now collaborating in order to prepare a complete collection of all Cypriot medical terms including anatomy, pharmacology and nursing.

2. A study of ‘strange’ traditional healing practices. This includes anything unusual or weird used in the past in order to heal or ameliorate illness.  Examples include baked lizards and gunpowder used in baldness, donkey manure in infections, and live mice in a variety of health recipes.

3. The collection, display and subsequent publication of medieval, Byzantian or early Cypriot literature with medical content. This includes poems and ballads, wishes and curses, folk stories, and couplets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5028">[[File:Lactation Room, Department of Labor, 2016.jpg|thumb|Lactation room at the US Department of Labor, in 2016]]
'''Lactation room''' (or '''Lactorium''') is an [[American English]] term for a private space where a [[breastfeeding|nursing mother]] can use a [[breast pump]]. The development is mostly confined to the United States, which is unique among developed countries in providing minimal [[maternity leave]]. Historian [[Jill Lepore]] argues that the "non-bathroom lactation room" and breast pumps generally are driven by corporate need for workers rather than mothers' wishes or babies' needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lepore|first1=Jill|title=Baby Food: If breast is best, why are women bottling their milk?|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/01/19/baby-food|accessdate=29 December 2017|work=The New Yorker|date=12 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Lactation rooms provide breastfeeding mothers with a private space to pump or nurse. While lactation spaces existed prior to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the amended   [https://www.dol.gov/whd/nursingmothers/Sec7rFLSA_btnm.htm Section 4207 of the Fair Labor Standards Act] requires employers with 50 employees or more to provide a private space for nursing mothers that's not a bathroom. 

==Popularity==
Over the past decade{{Clarify timeframe|date=April 2017}}, lactation rooms have become widely popular in the [[United States|US]] business setting.  The reason for this development is that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“mothers are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. labor force.  Approximately 70% of employed mothers with children younger than 3 years work full time.  One-third of these mothers return to work within 3 months after giving birth and two-thirds return within 6 months. Working outside the home is related to a shorter duration of breastfeeding, and intentions to work full-time are significantly associated with lower rates of breastfeeding initiation and shorter duration”. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/pdf/breastfeeding_interventions.pdf CDC] &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Benefits==
[[File:Lactation room.jpg|thumb|Lactation room at the University of Michigan, in 2014]]
In addition, breastfeeding benefits employers as breastfeeding results in decreased health claims, increased productivity, and fewer days missed from work to care for sick children. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbreastfeeding.org/Issue-Paper/Economics.pdf US Breastfeeding]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} &lt;/ref&gt;

One example of the benefits provided to businesses and employees by establishing a corporate lactation program is that of [[CIGNA]], the national employee benefits company.  In 1995, CIGNA established the “Working Well Moms” program, which provided lactation education program and lactation rooms.  In 2000, CIGNA and the [[UCLA]] conducted a study of 343 breastfeeding women who were taking part in CIGNA’s program.  The study revealed a savings of $240,000 annually in health care expenses for breastfeeding mothers and their children, and a savings of $60,000 annually through reduced absenteeism among breastfeeding mothers at CIGNA. &lt;ref name="CIGNA"&gt;[http://cigna.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=114&amp;item=335 CIGNA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007092332/http://cigna.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=114&amp;item=335 |date=2007-10-07 }} &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the study found that
&lt;blockquote&gt;

“breastfeeding duration for women enrolled in the Working Well Moms program is 72.5% at six months compared to a 21.1 percent national average of employed new mothers.” &lt;ref name="CIGNA"/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Generally, a lactation room includes a [[refrigerator]], sink, cleaning supplies, table, and comfortable chair.  The ability to pump throughout the day allows mothers to keep up their milk supply and enables them to save and take home the nutrient-rich milk they have pumped.

==Resources==
A variety of resources exist for breastfeeding mother and employers on how to establish and promote a lactation room or lactation support program.  The following are currently available:
*[http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/secure/documents/pdf/aiap037226.pdf American Institute of Architects' ''Lactation Room Design'']
*[https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/hwi/toolkits/lactation/index.htm Center for Disease Control’s ''Healthy Workplace Initiative'']
*[http://www.healthypeople.gov/ US Dept. of Health and Human Services’ ''Healthy People 2010'']

In addition, the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]], Maternal and Child Health Bureau is currently developing a toolkit to promote breastfeeding in the workplace called “The Business Case for Breastfeeding”.

'''Lipoatrophy''' is the term describing the localized loss of fat tissue. This may occur as a result of subcutaneous injections of insulin in the treatment of [[diabetes]], from the use of [[human growth hormone]] or from subcutaneous injections of [[copaxone]] used for the treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]]. In the latter case, an injection may produce a small dent at the injection site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Radermecker RP, Piérard GE, Scheen AJ |title=Lipodystrophy reactions to insulin: effects of continuous insulin infusion and new insulin analogs |journal=American journal of clinical dermatology |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=21–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17298103 |doi=10.2165/00128071-200708010-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipoatrophy occurs in [[HIV-associated lipodystrophy]], one cause of which is an [[adverse drug reaction]] that is associated with some [[antiretroviral medication]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barbaro G |title=Visceral fat as target of highly active antiretroviral therapy-associated metabolic syndrome |journal=Curr.

A more general term for an abnormal or degenerative condition of the entire body's [[adipose]] tissue is ''[[lipodystrophy]]''.

This list is a collection of the main guidebook writers for the hill-walking areas of the UK.

*[[M. J. B. Baddeley]] wrote guidebooks in the early 1900s (after the style of [[Baedeker]]?) His [[Lake District]]  volume continued in revised editions into the late 1960s
*[[George &amp; Ashley Abraham]], were climber/photographers who, together with [[Owen Glynne Jones]], started the tradition of photographic guides, though concentrating mainly on rock-climbing.
*[[W. A. Poucher]] developed the photographic guide to upland areas in the early 1960s
*[[Alfred Wainwright]] produced a comprehensive set of hand-drawn guides to the Lake District.
*The [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]] produces a set of 8 District Guides covering both the Scottish Highlands,  Skye &amp; Islands, and the hills of lowlands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8264">A '''medical triad''' is a group of three signs or symptoms, the result of injury to three organs, which characterise a specific medical condition. The appearance of all three signs conjoined together in another patient, points to that the patient has the same medical condition, or diagnosis. 

A '''medical pentad''' is a group of five.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9922">'''Mean opinion score''' (MOS) is a measure used in the domain of [[Quality of Experience]] and [[telecommunications engineering]], representing overall quality of a stimulus or system. It is the [[arithmetic mean]] over all individual “values on a predefined scale that a subject assigns to his opinion of the performance of a system quality”.&lt;ref&gt;ITU-T Rec. P.10 (2006) Vocabulary for performance and quality of service.&lt;/ref&gt; Such ratings are usually gathered in a [[Subjective video quality|subjective quality evaluation test]], but they can also be algorithmically estimated.

MOS is a commonly used measure for video, audio, and audiovisual quality evaluation, but not restricted to those modalities. ITU-T has defined several ways of referring to a MOS in Recommendation [https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.800.1 P.800.1], depending on whether the score was obtained from audiovisual, conversational, listening, talking, or video quality tests.

==Rating scales and mathematical definition==

The MOS is expressed as a single rational number, typically in the range 1–5, where 1 is lowest perceived quality, and 5 is the highest perceived quality. Other MOS ranges are also possible, depending on the [[rating scale]] that has been used in the underlying test. The [[Absolute Category Rating]] scale is very commonly used, which maps ratings between ''Bad'' and ''Excellent'' to numbers between 1 and 5, as seen in below table.
{| class="wikitable"
!Rating
!Label
|-
|5
|Excellent
|-
|4
|Good
|-
|3
|Fair
|-
|2
|Poor
|-
|1
|Bad
|}
Other standardized quality rating scales exist in [[ITU-T]] recommendations (such as [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.800-199608-I/en P.800] or [https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.910 P.910]). For example, one could use a continuous scale ranging between 1–100. Which scale is used depends on the purpose of the test. In certain contexts there are no statistically significant differences between ratings for the same stimuli when they are obtained using different scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huynh-Thu|first=Q.|last2=Garcia|first2=M. N.|last3=Speranza|first3=F.|last4=Corriveau|first4=P.|last5=Raake|first5=A.|date=2011-03-01|title=Study of Rating Scales for Subjective Quality Assessment of High-Definition Video|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5635365/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting|volume=57|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1109/TBC.2010.2086750|issn=0018-9316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MOS is calculated as the [[arithmetic mean]] over single ratings performed by human subjects for a given stimulus in a [[Subjective video quality|subjective quality evaluation test]]. Thus:

:&lt;math&gt;MOS = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N{R_n}}{N}&lt;/math&gt;

Where {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;}} are the individual ratings for a given stimulus by {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;}} subjects.

==Properties of the MOS==

The MOS is subject to certain mathematical properties and biases. In general, there is an ongoing debate on the usefulness of the MOS to quantify Quality of Experience in a single scalar value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoßfeld|first=Tobias|last2=Heegaard|first2=Poul E.|last3=Varela|first3=Martín|last4=Möller|first4=Sebastian|date=2016-12-01|title=QoE beyond the MOS: an in-depth look at QoE via better metrics and their relation to MOS|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41233-016-0002-1|journal=Quality and User Experience|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1007/s41233-016-0002-1|issn=2366-0139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the MOS is acquired using a categorical rating scales, it is based on – similar to [[Likert scale]]s – an [[Level of measurement#Ordinal scale|ordinal scale]]. In this case, the ranking of the scale items is known, but their interval is not. Therefore, it is mathematically incorrect to calculate a mean over individual ratings in order to obtain the central tendency; the median should be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Susan. "Likert scales: how to (ab) use them." Medical education 38.12 (2004): 1217-1218.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice and in the definition of MOS, it is considered acceptable to calculate the arithmetic mean.

It has been shown that for categorical rating scales (such as ACR), the individual items are not perceived equidistant by subjects. For example, there may be a larger “gap” between ''Good'' and ''Fair'' than there is between ''Good''  and ''Excellent''. The perceived distance may also depend on the language into which the scale is translated.&lt;ref&gt;Streijl, Robert C., Stefan Winkler, and David S. Hands. "Mean opinion score (MOS) revisited: methods and applications, limitations and alternatives." Multimedia Systems 22.2 (2016): 213-227.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exist studies that could not prove a significant impact of scale translation on the obtained results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinson|first=M. H.|last2=Janowski|first2=L.|last3=Pepion|first3=R.|last4=Huynh-Thu|first4=Q.|last5=Schmidmer|first5=C.|last6=Corriveau|first6=P.|last7=Younkin|first7=A.|last8=Callet|first8=P. Le|last9=Barkowsky|first9=M.|date=October 2012|title=The Influence of Subjects and Environment on Audiovisual Subjective Tests: An International Study|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6286980/|journal=IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing|volume=6|issue=6|pages=640–651|doi=10.1109/jstsp.2012.2215306|issn=1932-4553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other biases are present in the way MOS ratings are typically acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Zielinski, Slawomir, Francis Rumsey, and Søren Bech. "On some biases encountered in modern audio quality listening tests-a review." Journal of the Audio Engineering Society 56.6 (2008): 427-451.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the above-mentioned issues with scales that are perceived non-linearly, there is a so-called “range-equalization bias”: subjects, over the course of a subjective experiment, tend to give scores that span the entire rating scale. This makes it impossible to compare two different subjective tests if the range of presented quality differs. In other words, the MOS is never an absolute measure of quality, but only relative to the test in which it has been acquired.

For the above reasons – and due to several other contextual factors influencing the perceived quality in a subjective test – a MOS value should only be reported if the context in which the values have been collected in is known and reported as well. MOS values gathered from different contexts and test designs therefore should not be directly compared. ITU-T Recommendation [https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.800.2 P.800.2] prescribes how MOS values should be reported. Specifically, P.800.2 says:&lt;blockquote&gt;it is not meaningful to directly compare MOS values produced from separate experiments, unless those experiments were explicitly designed to be compared, and even then the data should be statistically analysed to ensure that such a comparison is valid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==MOS for speech and audio quality estimation==

MOS historically originates from [[subjectivity|subjective]] measurements where listeners would sit in a "quiet room" and score a telephone call quality as they perceived it. This kind of test methodology had been in use in the telephony industry for decades and was standardized in [[ITU-T]] recommendation [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.800-199608-I/en P.800]. It specifies that “the talker should be seated in a quiet room with volume between 30 and 120 dB and a reverberation time less than 500 ms (preferably in the range 200–300 ms). The room noise level must be below 30 dBA with no dominant peaks in the spectrum.” Requirements for other modalities were similarly specified in ITU recommendations later.

== MOS estimation using quality models ==
Obtaining MOS ratings may be time-consuming and expensive as it requires the recruitment of human assessors. For various use cases such as codec development or service quality monitoring purposes – where quality should be estimated repeatedly and automatically – MOS scores can also be predicted by [[Video quality#Objective video quality|objective quality models]], which typically have been developed and trained using human MOS ratings. A question that arises from using such models is whether the MOS differences produced are noticeable to the users. For example, when rating images on a five point MOS scale, an image with a MOS equal to 5 is expected to be noticeably better in quality than one with a MOS equal to 1. Contrary to that, it is not evident whether an image with a MOS equal to 3.8 is noticeably better in quality than one with a MOS equal to 3.6. Research conducted on determining the smallest MOS difference that is perceptible to users for digital photographs showed that a MOS difference of approximately 0.46 is required in order for 75% of the users to be able to detect the higher quality image. &lt;ref name="interpretMOS"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katsigiannis|first=S.|last2=Scovell|first2=J.

As a result, minimum noticeable MOS differences determined using analytical methods such as in &lt;ref name="interpretMOS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; may change over time.

[[File:Ningizzida.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The "libation vase of [[Gudea]]" with the dragon [[Mušḫuššu]], dedicated to Ningishzida (21st century BC [[short chronology]]). The [[caduceus]] is interpreted as depicting the god himself.]]

'''Ningishzida''' (''sum: &lt;sup&gt;[[dingir|d]]&lt;/sup&gt;nin-g̃iš-zid-da'') is a [[Mesopotamian deity]] of [[vegetation]] and the [[underworld]].  [[Thorkild Jacobsen]] translates ''Ningishzida'' as [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] for "lord of the good tree".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sumerian.org/sumerfaq.htm#s20 Sumerian.org Q&amp;A#20 (Ningishzida)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
In Sumerian mythology, he appears in [[Adapa|Adapa's]] myth as one of the two guardians of [[Anu|Anu's]] celestial palace, alongside [[Tammuz (deity)|Dumuzi]]. He was sometimes depicted as a [[snake|serpent]] with a human head.

[[Lagash]] had a temple dedicated to Ningishzida, and Gudea, ''[[patesi]]'' of Lagash in the 21st century BC (short chronology), was one of his devotees. In the [[Louvre]], there is a famous green [[steatite]] [[vase]] carved for King Gudea of Lagash, dedicated by its inscription: "To the god Ningiszida, his god Gudea, [[Ensí|Ensi]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} (governor) of Lagash, for the prolongation of his life, has dedicated this".

Ningishzida is sometimes the son of [[Ninazu]] and [[Ningiridda]], even though the myth Ningishzida's journey to the netherworld suggests he is the son of [[Ereshkigal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.7.3&amp;charenc=j# Ningishzidda's journey to the netherworld on ETCSL]&lt;/ref&gt; Following an inscription found at Lagash, he was the son of Anu, the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Maurice Price, ''Notes on the Pantheon of the Gudean Cylinders, The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures'', Vol. 17, No. 1 (Oct., 1900), pp. 47-53 {{jstor|528092}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife is [[Azimua]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/sum07.htm Sumerian Mythology: Chapter II. Myths of Origins]&lt;/ref&gt; and also Geshtinanna,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Bertman, 'Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia'. p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; while his sister is [[Amashilama]]. In some texts Ningishzida is said to be female,&lt;ref&gt;Princeton University professors Arthur Frothingham and Allan Marquand, 'American journal of archaeology'. p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; which means "Nin" would then refer to Lady, which is mostly how the word is used by the Sumerians. He or she was one of the ancestors of [[Gilgamesh]].

The [[Adapa]] myth mentions Ningishzida.&lt;ref name=Oracc/&gt;

The death of vegetation is associated with the travel to the underworld of Ningishzida.&lt;ref name=Oracc&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Adam|title=Ningišzida (god)|url=http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/ningizida/|publisher=Ancient Mesopotamian Gods and Goddesses, Oracc and the UK Higher Education Academy|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*The god appears in the ''[[Simon Necronomicon]]'' under the spelling "Ninnghizhidda".
*In [[Marilyn Manson]]'s 1998 autobiography ''[[The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell]]'', Manson encountered a suburban Occultist who pays tribute to Ningishzida.

The '''Nugent Score''' is a [[Gram stain]] scoring system for vaginal swabs to diagnose bacterial [[vaginosis]]. The Nugent score is calculated by assessing for the presence of large [[Gram-positive]] [[Rod-shaped bacteria|rods]] (''[[Lactobacillus]]'' morphotypes; decrease in ''Lactobacillus'' scored as 0 to 4), small Gram-variable rods ([[Gardnerella vaginalis]] morphotypes; scored as 0 to 4), and curved Gram-variable rods ([[Mobiluncus]] spp. morphotypes; scored as 0 to 2). A score of 7 to 10 is consistent with bacterial vaginosis without culture. The Nugent Score is now rarely used by physicians due to the time it takes to read the slides and requires the use of a trained microscopist.&lt;ref name=Bennett2015&gt;{{cite book | last = Bennett | first = John | title = Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's principles and practice of infectious diseases | publisher = Elsevier/Saunders | location = Philadelphia, PA | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781455748013 |postscript=; Access provided by the [[University of Pittsburgh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial vaginosis diagnosis is done by evaluating the pH, the presences of  ''[[Lactobacillus|Lactobacillu]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s spp.'' versus a mixed flora consisting of ''[[Gardnerella vaginalis]], [[Bacteroides]] spp, [[Mobiluncus]] spp, and [[Mycoplasma hominis]].'' Nugent's test for bacterial vaginosis is performed by measuring the pH, evaluating the presence of clue cells, white discharge an odor of amines after mixing with KOH. Prior to the development of Nugent's test, assessment of bacterial vaginosis was based on culturing ''G. vaginalis,'' examining a [[gram stain]] of [[vaginal discharge]] and [[gas chromatography]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A score of 0-10 is generated from combining three other scores.  The scores are as follows:
* 0–3 is considered negative for BV
* 4–6 is considered intermediate
* 7+ is considered indicative of BV.
At least 10–20 high power (1000× oil immersion) fields are counted and an average determined.

'''Pain disorder''' is [[chronic pain]] experienced by a patient in one or more areas, and is thought to be caused by [[Stress (biological)|psychological stress]]. The pain is often so severe that it disables the patient from proper functioning. Duration may be as short as a few days or as long as many years. The disorder may begin at any age, and occurs more frequently in girls than boys.&lt;ref name="Medscape Reference"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/914594|title=Pain Somatoform Disorder|work= Medscape Reference |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disorder often occurs after an accident or during an illness that has caused pain, which then takes on a 'life' of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WCV-4CWRVT2-10&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=0f93cc716ee0ce9ecd3f01293184b81b|title=Clinical utility of DSM-IV pain disorder|last1=Aigner|first1=Martin|last2=Bach|first2=Michael|date=Sep–Oct 1999|journal=Comprehensive psychiatry|doi=10.1016/S0010-440X(99)90140-2|accessdate = 2008-03-27|volume=40|pages=353–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-diagnoses==
The DSM-IV-TR specifies three coded subdiagnoses: pain disorder associated with psychological factors, pain disorder associated with both psychological factors and a general medical condition and pain disorder associated with a general medical condition (although the latter subtype is not considered a mental disorder and is coded separately within the DSM-IV-TR). Conditions such as [[dyspareunia]], [[somatization disorder]], [[conversion disorder]], or [[mood disorders]] can eliminate pain disorder as a diagnosis.&lt;ref name=minddisorders&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Ob-Ps/Pain-disorder.html|title=Pain disorder|work=Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders|first=Tanja|last=Bekhuis|accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis depends on the ability of physicians to explain the symptoms '''and''' on psychological influences.&lt;ref name="Medscape Reference"/&gt;

There are, however, authors who propose that the diagnosis for unexplained pain should be adjustment disorder because it does not pathologize individuals with this medical condition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychological Approaches to Pain Management, Third Edition: A Practitioner's Handbook|last=Turk|first=Dennis|last2=Gatchel|first2=Robert|publisher=Guilford Publications|year=2018|isbn=9781462528530|location=|pages=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is proposed to avoid the stigma of such illness classification.

==Symptoms==
Common symptoms of pain disorder are: negative or distorted cognition, such as feelings of despair or hopelessness; inactivity and passivity, in some cases disability; increased pain, sometimes requiring clinical treatment; sleep disturbance and fatigue; disruption of social relationships; depression and/or anxiety.&lt;ref name=minddisorders/&gt; Acute conditions last less than six months while chronic pain disorder lasts six or more months.&lt;ref name="Behavenet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behavenet.com/pain-disorder| title=Pain disorder|work=BehaveNet.|accessdate=2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no neurological or physiological basis for the pain. Pain is reported as more distressing than it should be had there been a physical explanation.

Pain behavior highlights the psychological aspect of pain disorder. This can be demonstrated how moderate pain symptoms become more painful when rewarded in the form of solicitous and attentive behavior of others, by monetary gain, or by the successful avoidance of distasteful activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kaplan &amp; Sadock's Concise Textbook of Clinical Psychiatry|last=Sadock|first=Benjamin|last2=Sadock|first2=Virginia|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2008|isbn=9780781787468|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same can be said about excessive worry. A minor physical symptom can be aggravated or become more harmful and threatening if the person suffering engages in a constant body and symptom appraisal, which can lead to stress and maladaptive behavior when coping with the physical symptom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
At least once a week, 10-30% of those under 18 years of age suffer from unexplainable headaches and abdominal pains in the United States, and the number is rising. People from [[Collectivism|collectivistic]] countries such as Japan, China, and Mexico are more likely to suffer from pain disorder than [[Individualism|individualistic]] countries such as the US and Sweden.&lt;ref name="Medscape Reference"/&gt;{{verify source|date=January 2015}}{{Dubious|reason=not in cited ref|date=January 2015}}

===Demographics===
Ethnicities show differences in how they express their discomfort and on how acceptable shows of pain and its tolerance are.
Most obvious in adolescence, females suffer from this disorder more than males, and females reach out more.
More unexplainable pains occur as people get older. Typically, younger children complain of only one symptom, commonly abdominal pains or headaches. The older they get, the more varied the pain location as well as more locations and increasing frequency.&lt;ref name="Medscape Reference"/&gt;

===Theories===
* Psychodynamic theory: unconscious conflicts or desires are converted into somatic symptom to protect the conscious of the person from  awareness of it
* Emotions and communication: children show distress in what may be the only way they can, physical symptoms, when they lack the ability to speak or express their thoughts in any way
* Social influences: where psychological disorders are frowned upon, whether in families or cultures, distress may be expressed in physical terms
* Learning theory: children learn to imitate a family member or pick up on possible gains of being "sick"
* Family systems theory: a child's role in a family may be the sick one as part of the family dynamics. Reasons why fall under four possibilities: ''[[enmeshment]]'', ''[[Helicopter parent|overprotection]]'', ''[[Strict father model|rigidity]]'', ''[[lack of conflict resolution]]''
* Trauma and abuse: this includes physical,&lt;ref&gt;Noll-Hussong M, Otti A, Laeer L, Wohlschlaeger A, Zimmer C, Lahmann C, et al. Aftermath of sexual abuse history on adult patients suffering from chronic functional pain syndromes: an fMRI pilot study. Journal of Psychosomatic Research. [Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't]. 2010 May;68(5):483-7.&lt;/ref&gt; psychological, or both combined with somatization. It is a common combination.&lt;ref name="Medscape Reference"/&gt; People who have a history of physical or sexual abuse are more likely to have this disorder. However, not every person with pain disorder has a history of abuse.

==Treatment==
The prognosis is worse when there are more areas of pain reported.&lt;ref name="Understanding Abnormal Behavior"&gt;. {{cite book|first=David|last= Derald Wing|last2=Sue|first2= Stanley|title=Understanding abnormal behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9780324829686|pages=623–27|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment may include psychotherapy (with [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]] or [[operant conditioning]]), medication (often with antidepressants but also with pain medications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/phantom-limb-pain|title=Pain Management: Phantom Limb Pain|date=2007-03-01|work=WebMD.com|first=Ephraim K.|last=Brenman|accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and sleep therapy. According to a study performed at the [[Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine]], antidepressants have an analgesic effect on patients suffering from pain disorder. In a randomized, placebo-controlled antidepressant treatment study, researchers found that "antidepressants decreased pain intensity in patients with psychogenic pain or somatoform pain disorder significantly more than placebo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fishbain, Cutler, Rosomoff, and Rosomoff|title=Do antidepressants have an analgesic effect in psychogenic pain and somatoform pain disorder?|url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/60/4/503.short|publisher=American psychosomatic Society|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescription and nonprescription pain medications do not help and can actually hurt if the patient suffers side effects or develops an addiction. Instead, antidpressants and talk therapy are recommended. [[cognitive-behavioral therapy|CBT]] helps patients learn what worsens the pain, how to cope, and how to function in their life while handling the pain. [[Antidepressant]]s work against the pain and worry. Unfortunately, many people do not believe the pain "is all in their head," so they refuse such treatments.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000922.htm|title=Somatoform Pain Disorder|work= MedlinePlus |accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other techniques used in the management of chronic pain may also be of use; these include massage, [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]], trigger point injections, surgical ablation, and non-interventional therapies such as meditation, yoga, and music and art therapy.&lt;ref name=minddisorders/&gt;

There are also interventions called pain control programs that involve the removal of patients from their usual settings to a clinic or facility that provides inpatient or outpatient treatments. These include multidisciplinary or multimodal approaches, which use combinations of cognitive, behavior, and group therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychological Approaches to Pain Management|last=Turk|first=Dennis|last2=Gatchel|first2=Robert|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2007|isbn=9781462528530|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning treatment===
Before treating a patient, a psychologist must learn as many facts as possible about the patient and the situation. A history of physical symptoms and a psychosocial history help narrow down possible correlations and causes. Psychosocial history covers the family history of disorders and worries about illnesses, chronically ill parents, stress and negative life events, problems with family functioning, and school difficulties (academic and social).
These indicators may reveal whether there is a connection between stress-inducing events and an onset or increase in pain, and the removal in one leading to the removal in the other. They also may show if the patient gains something from being ill and how their reported pain matches medical records.
Physicians may refer a patient to a psychologist after conducting medical evaluations, learning about any psychosocial problems in the family, discussing possible connections of pain with stress, and assuring the patient that the treatment will be a combination between medical and psychological care. Psychologists must then do their best to find a way to measure the pain, perhaps by asking the patient to put it on a number scale. Pain questionnaires, screening instruments, interviews, and inventories may be conducted to discover the possibility of somatoform disorders. [[Projective test]]s may also be used.&lt;ref name="Medscape Reference"/&gt;

==Prevention==
Early intervention when pain first occurs or begins to become chronic offers the best opportunity for prevention of pain disorder.&lt;ref name=minddisorders/&gt;

A '''ploughing match''' is a contest between people who each [[plough]] part of a [[Field (agriculture)|field]].  Nowadays there are usually classes for [[Horse-drawn vehicle|horse-drawn]] ploughs and for [[tractor]] ploughing.  Points are awarded for straightness and neatness of the resulting furrows..

'''Prenatal development''' ({{ety|la|natalis|relating to birth}}) is the process in which an [[embryo]] and later [[fetus]] develops during [[gestation]]. Prenatal development starts with [[fertilization]], the first stage in [[embryogenesis]] which continues in fetal development until [[birth]].

In human [[pregnancy]], prenatal development, also known as '''antenatal development''', is the [[human embryogenesis|development of the embryo]] following fertilization, and continued as [[fetus|fetal]] development. By the end of the tenth week of [[gestational age]] the embryo has acquired its basic form and is referred to as a [[fetus]]. The next period is that of fetal development where many organs become fully developed. This fetal period is described both topically (by organ) and chronologically (by time) with major occurrences being listed by gestational age.

In other animals the very early stages of [[embryogenesis]] are the same as those in humans. In later stages, development across all [[taxon|taxa]] of animals and the length of gestation vary.

==Terminology==
{{anchor|perinatal}}

[[Image:Prenatal development table.svg|center|thumb|900px|Stages during [[pregnancy]]. Embryogenesis is marked in green. Weeks and months are numbered [[gestational age|by gestation]].]]

Different terms are used to describe '''prenatal development''', meaning '''development before birth'''. A term with the same meaning is the "antepartum" (from Latin ''ante'' "before" and ''parere'' "to give birth") Sometimes "antepartum" is however used to denote the period between the 24th/26th week of [[gestation]]al age until birth, for example in [[antepartum hemorrhage]].&lt;ref name=patient.info&gt;[http://www.patient.info/doctor/Antepartum-Haemorrhage.htm patient.info » PatientPlus » Antepartum Haemorrhage] Last Updated: 5 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewomens.org.au/AntepartumHaemorrhage The Royal Women’s Hospital &gt; antepartum haemorrhage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108223247/http://www.thewomens.org.au/AntepartumHaemorrhage |date=8 January 2010 }} Retrieved on Jan 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''perinatal period''' (from Greek ''peri'', "about, around" and Latin ''nasci'' "to be born") is "around the time of [[childbirth|birth]]". In [[developed countries]] and at facilities where expert neonatal care is available, it is considered from 22 completed weeks (usually about 154 days) of [[gestation]] (the time when [[birth weight]] is normally 500 g) to 7 completed days after birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://test.cp.euro.who.int/document/e68459.pdf Definitions and Indicators in Family Planning. Maternal &amp; Child Health and Reproductive Health.] By European Regional Office, World Health Organization. Revised March 1999 &amp; January 2001. In turn citing: WHO Geneva, WHA20.19, WHA43.27, Article 23&lt;/ref&gt; In many of the [[developing country|developing countries]] the starting point of this period is considered 28 completed weeks of gestation (or weight more than 1000 g).&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Meharban (2010).

==Fertilization==
{{Main|Human fertilization}} [[Image:Sperm-egg.jpg|thumb|250px|A sperm fertilizing an ovum.]]
When [[semen]] is released into the [[vagina]], the [[spermatozoa]] travel through the [[cervix]] and body of the uterus and into the [[Fallopian tube]]s. [[Fertilization]] of the [[egg cell]] (ovum), usually takes place in one of the Fallopian tubes. Many sperm are released with the possibility of just one sperm cell managing to adhere to and enter the thick protective shell-like layer surrounding the ovum. The first sperm that penetrates fully into the egg donates its [[genetic material]] ([[DNA]]). The egg then polarizes, repelling any additional sperm. The resulting combination is called a [[zygote]], a new and genetically unique organism. The term "conception" refers variably to either fertilization or to formation of the [[conceptus]] after its [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] in the uterus, and [[beginning of pregnancy controversy|this terminology is controversial]].

Prior to fertilization, each ovum, as a [[gamete]], contains half of the genetic material that will fuse with the male gamete, which carries the other half of the genetic material (DNA). The ovum only carries the X female sex chromosome whilst the sperm carries a single sex chromosome of either an X or a male Y chromosome. The resulting human zygote is similar to the majority of somatic cells because it contains two copies of the genome in a [[diploid]] set of [[chromosomes]]. One set of chromosomes came from the nucleus of the ovum and the second set from the nucleus of the sperm.

The zygote is male if the egg is fertilized by a sperm that carries a Y chromosome, and it is female if the egg is fertilized by a sperm that carries an X chromosome.&lt;ref name = Schacter11&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel|title=Psychology Second Edition|year=2009|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=United States of America|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2|chapter=11-Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Y chromosome contains a gene, [[SRY]], which will switch on [[androgen]] production at a later stage, leading to the development of a [[male]] body type. In contrast, the [[mitochondria]]l [[Mitochondrial DNA|genetic information]] of the zygote comes entirely from the mother via the ovum.

==Development of the embryo==
{{Main|Human embryogenesis}}
[[File:HumanEmbryogenesis.svg|thumb|500px|The initial stages of [[human embryogenesis]].]]
The embryonic period in humans begins at [[fertilization]] (penetration of the egg by the sperm) and continues until the end of the 10th week of gestation (8th week by embryonic age). The period of two weeks from fertilization is also referred to as the germinal stage.

The [[embryo]] spends the next few days traveling down the [[Fallopian tube]]. It starts out as a single cell [[zygote]] and then divides several times to form a ball of cells called a [[morula]]. Further [[cellular division]] is accompanied by the formation of a small cavity between the cells. This stage is called a [[blastocyst]]. Up to this point there is no growth in the overall size of the embryo, as it is confined within a glycoprotein shell, known as the [[zona pellucida]]. Instead, each division produces successively smaller cells.

The [[blastocyst]] reaches the [[uterus]] at roughly the fifth day after fertilization. It is here that lysis of the zona pellucida occurs. This process is analogous to [[zona hatching]], a term that refers to the emergence of the blastocyst from the zona pellucida, when incubated [[in vitro]]. This allows the [[trophectoderm]] cells of the blastocyst to come into contact with, and adhere to, the [[endometrium|endometrial]] cells of the uterus. The trophectoderm will eventually give rise to extra-embryonic structures, such as the [[placenta]] and the membranes. The embryo becomes embedded in the endometrium in a process called [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]]. In most successful pregnancies, the embryo implants 8 to 10 days after ovulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilcox AJ, Baird DD, Weinberg CR | year = 1999 | title = Time of implantation of the conceptus and loss of pregnancy | url = | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 340 | issue = 23| pages = 1796–9 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199906103402304 | pmid = 10362823 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The embryo, the extra-embryonic membranes, and the placenta are collectively referred to as a conceptus, or the "products of conception".

Rapid growth occurs and the embryo's main features begin to take form. This process is called [[cell differentiation|differentiation]], which produces the varied cell types (such as blood cells, kidney cells, and nerve cells). A spontaneous abortion, or [[miscarriage]], in the first trimester of pregnancy is usually&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moore L. Keith.  |title=Before We Are Born: Essentials of Embryology and Birth Defects |publisher=Saunders/Elsevier |location=Philadelphia, PA |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4160-3705-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to major genetic mistakes or abnormalities in the developing embryo. During this critical period (most of the [[first trimester]]), the developing embryo is also susceptible to toxic exposures, such as:

* [[Alcohol]], certain [[Psychoactive drug|drug]]s, and other [[toxins]] that cause [[birth defect]]s, such as [[fetal alcohol syndrome]]
* [[Infection]] (such as [[rubella]] or [[cytomegalovirus]])
* [[Radiation]] from [[x-ray]]s or [[radiation therapy]]
* [[Nutritional deficiencies]] such as lack of [[folate]] which contributes to [[spina bifida]]

==Development of the fetus==

From the 10th week of gestation (8th week of development), the developing organism is called a fetus.

All major structures are already formed in the fetus, but they continue to grow and develop.

Since the precursors of all the major organs are created by this time, the fetal period is described both by organ and by a list of changes by weeks of gestational age.

Because the precursors of the organs are now formed, the fetus is not as sensitive to damage from environmental exposure as the embryo was. Instead, toxic exposure often causes physiological abnormalities or minor congenital malformation.

==Development of organ systems==
{{Organ system development}}

Development continues throughout the life of the embryo and fetus and through into life after birth. Significant changes occur to many systems in the period after birth as they [[adaptation to extrauterine life|adapt to life outside the uterus]].

===Fetal blood===
Fetal [[hematopoiesis]] first takes place in the [[yolk sac]]. The function is transferred to liver by 10th week of gestation and to spleen and bone marrow beyond that. The total blood volume is about 125 ml/kg fetal body weight near term.

====Red blood cells====
Fetus produces megaloblastic red blood cells early in development, which become normoblastic near term. Life span of fetal RBCs is 80 days. Rh antigen appears at about 40 days of gestation.

====White blood cells====
Fetus starts producing [[leukocytes]] at 2 months gestation mainly from [[thymus]] and [[spleen]]. [[Lymphocytes]] derived from thymus are called [[T lymphocytes]], whereas the ones derived from bone marrow are called [[B lymphocytes]]. Both these populations of lymphocytes have short-lived and long-lived groups. Short-lived T lymphocytes usually reside in thymus, bone marrow and spleen; whereas long-lived T lymphocytes reside in blood stream. [[Plasma cells]] are derived from B lymphocytes and their life in fetal blood is 0.5 to 2 days.

===Fetal hormones===
{{Main|Development of the endocrine system}}
Thyroid gland is the first to develop in fetus at 4th week of gestation. Insulin secretion in fetus starts around 12th week of gestation.

==Cognitive development==
Initial knowledge of the effects of prenatal experience on later neuropsychological development originates from the Dutch Famine Study, which researched the cognitive development of individuals born after the [[Dutch famine of 1944–45]].&lt;ref&gt;Henrichs, J. (2010). Prenatal determinants of early behavioral and cognitive development: The generation R study. Rotteram: Erasmus Universiteit.&lt;/ref&gt; The first studies focused on the consequences of the famine to cognitive development, including the prevalence of mental retardation.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Z., Susser, M., Saenger, G., &amp; Marolla, F. (1972). Nutrition and mental performance. Science, 178(62),708-713.&lt;/ref&gt; Such studies predate [[Thrifty phenotype|David Barker's hypothesis]] about the association between the prenatal environment and the development of chronic conditions later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, D. J., Winter, P. D., Osmond, C., Margetts, B., &amp; Simmonds, S. J. (1989). Weight in infancy and death from ischaemic heart disease. Lancet, 2(8663), 577-580.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial studies found no association between malnourishment and cognitive development&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Z., Susser, M., Saenger, G., &amp; Marolla, F. (1972). Nutrition and mental performance. Science, 178(62),708-713.&lt;/ref&gt;, but later studies found associations between malnourishment and increased risk for schizophrenia&lt;ref&gt;Brown, A., Susser, E., Hoek, H., Neugebauer, R., Lin, S., &amp; Gorman, J. (1996). Schizophrenia and affective disorders after prenatal famine.

Prenatal exposure to wartime famine and development of antisocial personality disorder in early adulthood. Jama, 282(5), 455-462.&lt;/ref&gt;, and affective disorders&lt;ref&gt;Brown, A. S., van Os, J., Driessens, C., Hoek, H. W., &amp; Susser, E. S. (2000). Further evidence of relation between prenatal famine and major affective disorder. American Journal of Psychiatry, 157(2), 190-195.&lt;/ref&gt;.

There is evidence that the acquisition of language beings in the prenatal stage. After 26 weeks of gestation, the [[Auditory system|peripheral auditory system]] is already fully formed.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, R. B. (1976). Auditory Competence in Early Life: The Roots of Communicate Behavior Baltimore: University Park Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, most low-frequency sounds (less than 300 HZ) can reach the fetal inner ear in the womb of mammals.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhardt, K. J., Otto, R., Abrams, R. M., Colle, J. J., Burchfield, D. J., and Peters, A. J. M. (1992). Cochlear microphones recorded from fetal and newborn sheep. Am. J. Otolaryngol. 13, 226–233.&lt;/ref&gt; Those low-frequency sounds include pitch, rhythm, and phonetic information related to language.&lt;ref&gt;Lecaneut, J. P., and Granier-Deferre, C. (1993). “Speech stimuli in the fetal environment,” in Developmental Neurocognition: Speech and Face Processing in the First Year of Life, eds B. De Boysson-Bardies, S. de Schonen, P. Jusczyk, P. MacNeilage, and J. Morton (Norwell, MA: Kluwer Academic Publishing), 237–248.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there is evidence of language learning during gestation. Studies have indicated that fetuses react to and recognize differences between sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Kisilevsky, B. S., Hains, S. M. J., Lee, K., Xie, X., Ye, H. H., Zhang, K., and Wang, Z. (2003). Effects of experience on fetal voice recognition. Psychol. Sci. 14, 220–224.&lt;/ref&gt; Such ideas are further reinforced by the fact that newborns present a preference for their mother’s voice&lt;ref&gt;DeCasper, A. J., and Fifer, W. P. (1980). Of human bonding: newborns prefer their mother’s voices. Science 208, 1174–1176.&lt;/ref&gt;, present behavioral recognition of stories only heard during gestation&lt;ref&gt;DeCasper, A. J., and Spence, M. J. (1986). Prenatal maternal speech influences newborns’ perception of speech sounds. Infant Behav. Dev. 9, 133–150.&lt;/ref&gt;, and (in monolingual mothers) present preference for their native language.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, C., Cooper, R. P., and Fifer, W. P. (1993). Two-day-olds prefer their native language. Infant Behav. Dev. 16, 495–500.&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent study with [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] demonstrated different brain activation in newborns hearing their native language compared to when they were presented with a different language, further supporting the idea that language learning starts while in gestation.&lt;ref&gt;May, L., Byers-Heinlein, K., Gervain, J., &amp; Werker, J. F. (2011). Language and the Newborn Brain: Does Prenatal Language Experience Shape the Neonate Neural Response to Speech? Frontiers in Psychology, 2. doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00222&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition==
The fetus passes through 3 phases of acquisition of nutrition from the mother:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Daftary, Shirish; Chakravarti, Sudip (2011). Manual of Obstetrics, 3rd Edition. Elsevier. pp. 1-16. {{ISBN|9788131225561}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Absorption phase:'' Zygote is nourished by cellular cytoplasm and secretions in fallopian tubes and uterine cavity.
# ''Histoplasmic transfer:'' After [[Implantation (human embryo)|nidation]] and before establishment of [[uteroplacental circulation]], fetal nutrition is derived from [[decidual cells]] and maternal blood pools that open up as a result of eroding activity of [[trophoblasts]].
# ''Hematotrophic phase:'' After third week of gestation, substances are transported passively via [[intervillous space]].

==Growth rate==
{{anchor|growth}}Growth rate of fetus is linear up to 37 weeks of gestation, after which it plateaus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The growth rate of an embryo and infant can be reflected as the weight per [[gestational age]], and is often given as the weight put in relation to what would be expected by the gestational age. A baby born within the normal range of weight for that gestational age is known as '''appropriate for gestational age (AGA)'''. An abnormally slow growth rate results in the infant being [[small for gestational age]], and, on the other hand, an abnormally large growth rate results in the infant being [[large for gestational age]]. A slow growth rate and [[preterm birth]] are the two factors that can cause a [[low birth weight]]. Low birth weight (below 2000&amp;nbsp;grams) can ultimately increase the likelihood of schizophrenia by almost four times. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0963721410378360| title=Prenatal Factors in Schizophrenia| journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science| volume=19| issue=4| pages=209–213| year=2010| last1=King| first1=Suzanne| last2=St-Hilaire| first2=Annie| last3=Heidkamp| first3=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth rate can be roughly correlated with the [[fundal height]] which can be estimated by abdominal palpation. More exact measurements can be performed with [[obstetric ultrasonography]].

==Factors influencing development==
{{Further|Alcohol and pregnancy|Smoking and pregnancy}}
[[Intrauterine growth restriction]] is one of the causes of [[low birth weight]] associated with over half of [[neonatal deaths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lawn JE, Cousens S, Zupan J | year = 2005 | title = 4 million neonatal deaths: when? Where? Why? | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 365 | issue = 9462| pages = 891–900 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(05)71048-5 | pmid=15752534}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Poverty ===
Poverty has been linked to poor prenatal care and has been an influence on prenatal development. Women in poverty are more likely to have children at a younger age, which results in low birth weight. Many of these expecting mothers have little education and are therefore less aware of the risks of [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], drinking [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], and [[drug abuse|drug use]] – other factors that influence the growth rate of a fetus. 

=== Mother's age ===
Women between the ages of 16 and 35 have a healthier environment for a fetus than women under 16 or over 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-complications.html|title=Pregnancy Complications|last=Centers for Disease Control|date=2018|website=Centers for Disease Control|archive-url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-complications.html|archive-date=2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women between this age gap are more likely to have fewer complications. Women over 35 are more inclined to have a longer labor period, which could potentially result in death of the mother or fetus. Women under 16 and over 35 have a higher risk of preterm labor (premature baby), and this risk increases for women in poverty, African Americans, and women who smoke. Young mothers are more likely to engage in high risk behaviors, such as using alcohol, drugs, or smoking, resulting in negative consequences for the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdc.gov|title=About Teenage Pregnancy|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Centers for Disease Control|archive-url=https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/about/index.htm|archive-date=2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premature babies from young mothers are more likely to have neurological defects that will influence their coping capabilities – irritability, trouble sleeping, constant crying for example. There is a risk of [[Down syndrome]] for infants born to those aged over 40 years. Young teenaged mothers (younger than 16) and mothers over 35 are more exposed to the risks of miscarriages, premature births, and birth defects.

=== Drug use ===

An estimated 5 percent of fetuses in the United States are exposed to illicit drug use during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wendell|first=A. D.|date=2013|title=Overview and epidemiology of substance abuse in pregnancy|doi=10.1097/GRF.0b013e31827feeb9|pmid=23314721|journal=Clinical Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology|volume=56|issue=1|pages=91–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maternal drug use occurs when drugs ingested by the pregnant woman are metabolized in the placenta and then transmitted to the fetus. When using drugs (narcotics), there is a greater risk of birth defects, low birth weight, and a higher rate of death in infants or stillbirths. Drug use will influence extreme irritability, crying, and risk for SIDS once the fetus is born. The chemicals in drugs can cause an addiction in the babies once they are born. Marijuana will slow the fetal growth rate and can result in premature delivery. It can also lead to low birth weight, a shortened gestational period and complications in delivery. Heroin will cause interrupted fetal development, stillbirths, and can lead to numerous birth defects. Heroin can also result in premature delivery, creates a higher risk of miscarriages, result in facial abnormalities and head size, and create gastrointestinal abnormalities in the fetus. There is an increased risk for SIDS, dysfunction in the central nervous system, and neurological dysfunctions including tremors, sleep problems, and seizures. The fetus is also put at a great risk for low birth weight and respiratory problems. Cocaine use results in a smaller brain, which results in learning disabilities for the fetus. Cocaine puts the fetus at a higher risk of being stillborn or premature. Cocaine use also results in low birthweight, damage to the central nervous system, and motor dysfunction.

=== Alcohol ===

Maternal alcohol use leads to disruptions of the fetus's brain development, interferes with the fetus's cell development and organization, and affects the maturation of the central nervous system. Even small amounts of alcohol use can cause lower height, weight and head size at birth and higher aggressiveness and lower intelligence during childhood.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mattson|first=Sarah N.|last2=Roesch|first2=Scott C.|last3=Fagerlund|first3=Åse|last4=Autti-Rämö|first4=Ilona|last5=Jones|first5=Kenneth Lyons|last6=May|first6=Philip A.|last7=Adnams|first7=Colleen M.|last8=Konovalova|first8=Valentina|last9=Riley|first9=Edward P.|date=2010-06-21|title=Toward a Neurobehavioral Profile of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research|volume=34|issue=9|pages=1640–1650|doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2010.01250.x|pmid=20569243|pmc=2946199|issn=0145-6008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder]]  is a developmental disorder that is a consequence of heavy alcohol intake by the mother during pregnancy. Children with FASD have a variety of distinctive facial features, heart problems, and cognitive problems such as developmental disabilities, attention difficulties, and memory deficits. &lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Smoking and nicotine ===

When a mother smokes during pregnancy the fetus is exposed to nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide. Nicotine results in less blood flow to the fetus because it constricts the blood vessels. Carbon monoxide reduces the oxygen flow to the fetus. The reduction of blood and oxygen flow may result in miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, and premature births.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Espy|first=Kimberly Andrews|last2=Fang|first2=Hua|last3=Johnson|first3=Craig|last4=Stopp|first4=Christian|last5=Wiebe|first5=Sandra A.|last6=Respass|first6=Jennifer|date=2011|title=Prenatal tobacco exposure: Developmental outcomes in the neonatal period.|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=47|issue=1|pages=153–169|doi=10.1037/a0020724|pmid=21038943|pmc=3057676|issn=1939-0599}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exposure to secondhand smoke leads to higher risks of low birth weight and childhood cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rückinger|first=Simon|last2=Beyerlein|first2=Andreas|last3=Jacobsen|first3=Geir|last4=von Kries|first4=Rüdiger|last5=Vik|first5=Torstein|date=December 2010|title=Growth in utero and body mass index at age 5years in children of smoking and non-smoking mothers|journal=Early Human Development|volume=86|issue=12|pages=773–777|doi=10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2010.08.027|pmid=20869819|issn=0378-3782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diseases ===
If a mother is infected with a disease, the placenta cannot always filter out [[pathogen]]s. Viruses such as rubella, chicken pox, mumps, herpes, and human immunodeficiency (HIV) are associated with increased risk of miscarriage, low birth weight, and prematurity, physical malformations, and intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Waldorf |first=K. M. A. |date=2013 |title=Influence of infection during pregnancy on fetal development |journal=Reproduction |volume=146 |issue=5 |pages=151–162 |pmid=23884862  |pmc=4060827 |doi=10.1530/REP-13-0232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The human immunodeficiency virus can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).  Untreated HIV infected expectant mothers pass the virus to their developing offspring between 10 and 20 percent of the time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/2014/en|title=World health statistics|last=|first=|date=2014|website=World Health Organization|archive-url=www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/2014/en|archive-date=2014|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Expectant mothers infected with bacterial or parasitic diseases may also pass the diseases on to the fetus. Examples of diseases include chlamydia, syphilis, tuberculosis, malaria, and toxoplasmosis.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Diav-Citrin |first=O |date=2011 |title=Prenatal exposures associated with neurodevelopmental delay and disabilities |journal=Developmental Disabilities |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=71–84 |pmid=23362027  |doi=10.1002/ddrr.1102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most common of these diseases is toxoplasmosis.  A pregnant female may become infected through contact with contaminated soil, such as through gardening, eating raw or undercooked meat or unwashed vegetables or fruits, or contact with the feces of infected cats.  If the exposure occurs during the first trimester, eye and brain damage may result.  Exposure later in pregnancy may result in mild visual and cognitive impairments. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jones |first=J. |date=2003 |title=Congenital toxoplasmosis |journal=American Family Physician |volume=67 |issue=10 |pages=2131–2137 |pmid=12776962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mother's diet and physical health ===

Adequate nutrition is needed for a healthy fetus.  Mothers who gain less than 20 pounds during pregnancy are at increased risk for having a preterm or low birth weight infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ehrenberg |first=H |date=2003 |title=Low maternal weight, failure to thrive in pregnancy, and adverse pregnancy outcomes |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=189 |issue=6 |pages=1726–1730 |pmid=14710105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; . Iron and iodine are especially important during prenatal development.  Mothers who are deficient in iron are at risk for having a preterm or low birth weight infant.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/nut/#mic|title=Micronutrient deficiencies|last=|first=|date=2002|website=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iodine deficiencies increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and fetal brain abnormalities Adequate [[prenatal care]] gives an improved result in the [[neonate|newborn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is prenatal care and why is it important?|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/pregnancy/conditioninfo/Pages/prenatal-care.aspx|website=www.nichd.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Low birth weight ===
Low birth weight increases an infants risk of long-term growth and cognitive and language deficits. It also results in a shortened gestational period and can lead to prenatal complications.

=== Stress ===
Stress during pregnancy can impact the development of the embryo.  Reilly (2017) states that stress can come from many forms of life events such as community, family, financial issues, and natural causes.  While a woman is pregnant, stress from outside sources can take a toll on the growth in the womb that may affect the child’s learning and relationships when born. For instance, they may have behavioral problems and might be antisocial. The stress that the mother experiences affects the fetus and the fetus’ growth which can include the fetus’ nervous system (Reilly, 2017). Stress can also lead to low birth weight. Even after avoiding other factors like alcohol, drugs, and being healthy, stress can have its impacts whether families know it or not. Many women who deal with maternal stress do not seek treatment.
Similar to stress, Reilly stated that in recent studies, researchers have found that pregnant women who show depressive symptoms are not as attached and bonded to their child while it is in the womb (2017). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reilly |first1=Nicole |title=Stress, depression and anxiety during pregnancy: How does it impact on children and how can we intervene early? |journal=International Journal of Birth &amp; Parent Education |date=2017 |volume=5 |issue=1 |page=9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental toxins ===
Exposure to [[environmental toxins in pregnancy]] lead to higher rates of miscarriage, sterility, and birth defects. Toxins include fetal exposure to lead, mercury, and ethanol or hazardous environments.  Prenatal exposure to mercury may lead to physical deformation, difficulty in chewing and swallowing, and poor motoric coordination.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Caserta |first=D |date=2013 |title=Heavy metals and placental fetal-maternal barrier: A mini review on the major concerns |journal=European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences |volume=17 |issue=16 |pages=2198–2206 |pmid=23893187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exposure to high levels of lead prenatally is related to prematurity, low birth weight, brain damage, and a variety of physical defects. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Exposure to persistent air pollution from traffic and smog may lead to reduced infant head size, low birth weight, increased infant death rates, impaired lung and immune system development. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Proietti|first=E|date=2013|title=Air pollution during pregnancy and neonatal outcome: A review|url=|journal=Journal of Aerosol Medicine and Pulmonary Drug Delivery|volume=26|issue=1|pages=9–23|via=|pmid=22856675|doi=10.1089/jamp.2011.0932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types  ==
Health interventions may be run by a variety of organizations, including [[health department]]s and private organizations. Such interventions can operate at various scales, such as on a global, country, or community level. The whole population can be reached via websites, audio/video messages and other mass media, or specific groups can be affected by administrative action, such as increasing the provision of healthy food at schools.

=== Screening ===
{{Main|Screening (medicine)}}
Screening refers to the practice of testing a set of individuals who meet a certain criteria (such as age, sex, or sexual activity) for a disease or disorder. Many forms of screening are public health interventions. For example, mothers are routinely screened for HIV and Hepatitis B during pregnancy. Detection during pregnancy can prevent [[Vertical transmission|maternal transmission]] of the disease during childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/screening-blood-test-infectious-diseases-pregnant/|title=Screening for hepatitis B, HIV and syphilis|last=|first=|date=2018-01-10|website=www.nhs.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vaccination ===
{{Main|Vaccination schedule}}
Vaccination programs are one of the most effective and common types of public health interventions. Typically programs may be in the form of recommendations or run by [[Health department|governmental health departments]] or nationalised health care systems. For instance, in the U.S., the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Contro]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l decides on a vaccination schedule, and most private health insurers cover these vaccinations. In the UK, the [[National Health Service|NHS]] both decides and implements vaccination protocols. [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s may also may be involved in funding or implementing vaccination programs; for instance [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] assists governments in Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan with the administration of [[Polio vaccine|polio vaccination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Polio|title=Polio|website=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supplementation ===
Supplementation of [[Food fortification|food]] or water of nutrients can reduce [[vitamin deficiency]] and other diseases. Supplementation may be required by law or voluntary. Some examples of interventions include:

=== Behavioural ===
{{Main|Behavior change (public health)}}
Interventions intended to change the behaviour of individuals can be especially challenging. One such form is [[health promotion]], where [[Health education|education]] and [[Mass media|media]] may be used to promote healthy behaviours, such as eating healthy foods (to prevent [[obesity]]), using [[condom]]s (to prevent the transmission of [[Sexually transmitted infection|STDs]]), or stopping [[open defecation]] in [[Developing country|developing countries]] (see for example in India the campaign [[Swachh Bharat mission]]).

The use of laws to criminalise certain behaviours can also be considered a public health intervention, such as [[Vaccination policy|mandatory vaccination]] programs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haverkate|first=M|last2=D’Ancona|first2=F|last3=Giambi|first3=C|last4=Johansen|first4=K|last5=Lopalco|first5=P L|last6=Cozza|first6=V|last7=Appelgren|first7=E|last8=on behalf of the VENICE project gat|first8=collective|date=2012-05-31|title=Mandatory and recommended vaccination in the EU, Iceland and Norway: results of the VENICE 2010 survey on the ways of implementing national vaccination programmes|journal=Eurosurveillance|language=en|volume=17|issue=22|doi=10.2807/ese.17.22.20183-en|issn=1560-7917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vamos|first=Cheryl A.|last2=McDermott|first2=Robert J.|last3=Daley|first3=Ellen M.|date=June 2008|title=The HPV Vaccine: Framing the Arguments FOR and AGAINST Mandatory Vaccination of All Middle School Girls|journal=Journal of School Health|language=en|volume=78|issue=6|pages=302–309|doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2008.00306.x|pmid=18489462|issn=0022-4391}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Criminal transmission of HIV|criminalisation of HIV transmission]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, such measures are typically controversial, particularly in the case of HIV criminalisation where there is evidence it may be counter productive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burris|first=Scott|date=2008-08-06|title=The Case Against Criminalization of HIV Transmission|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/182315|journal=JAMA|language=en|volume=300|issue=5|pages=578–81|doi=10.1001/jama.300.5.578|pmid=18677032|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=E|date=December 2009|title=Criminalization of HIV transmission: poor public health policy.|url=http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/20225503|journal=HIV/AIDS Policy &amp; Law Review|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=|issn=1712-624X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-09-01|title=The problem of "significant risk": Exploring the public health impact of criminalizing HIV non-disclosure|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953611004199|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|language=en|volume=73|issue=5|pages=668–675|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.06.051|pmid=21835524|issn=0277-9536|last1=Mykhalovskiy|first1=Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws which tax certain unhealthy products may also be effective, although also not without controversy, and are sometimes called a "[[sin tax]]".

== Evaluating efficacy ==
Evaluating and predicting the efficacy of a public health intervention, as well as calculating [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost effectiveness]], is essential. An intervention should ideally lower [[Disease|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. Several systematic protocols exist to assist developing such interventions, such as [[Intervention Mapping]].&lt;ref name="im_book"&gt;Bartholomew, L. K., Parcel, G. S., Kok, G., Gottlieb, N. H., &amp; Fernández, M.E., 2011. ''Planning health promotion programs; an Intervention Mapping approach'', 3rd Ed. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She works for the [[Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium]]. Blumenstein has been a member of the [[International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers]]—a group of spiritual elders, [[Medicine man|medicine women]] and wisdom keepers—since its founding in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (2006) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born to her recently widowed mother who lived in the village of [[Tununak, Alaska|Tununak]], [[Nelson Island (Alaska)|Nelson Island]], Alaska, Blumenstein was born while her mother was in a fishing boat.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (2006) pp. 43–46&lt;/ref&gt; Blumenstein felt angry not having her father around when she was a girl, because he died a month before she was born.&lt;ref name="sch46"&gt;Schaefer (2006) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Blumenstein was given a [[Yup'ik]] name means 'Tail End Clearing of the Pathway to the Light'—Rita sees the poetry in the name as she regards herself as being born during "the tail end of the old ways".&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (2006) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Blumenstein's healing abilities were recognised by the wise elders (grandmothers) of her tribe from an early age. Blumenstein began healing at the age of 4.&lt;ref name="sch46"/&gt;

At the age of 9, Blumenstein's great-grandmother gave her thirteen eagle feathers and thirteen stones to give to the International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

| url = http://www.utne.com/2007-11-01/Heartland-Just-Like-Grandma-Told-You.aspx
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, when the International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers convened for the first time, Blumenstein passed out these precious objects to the rest of the members with tears in her eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (2006) pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family life==
Blumenstein was married to her husband, a [[Jews|Jewish]] man, for 43 years. Five of Blumenstein's 6 children have also died.&lt;ref name="sch48"&gt;Schaefer (2006) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Blumenstein's own health has not always been good and in 1995, she found that she had [[cancer]].&lt;ref name = "evergreen"/&gt; Blumenstein saw that being diagnosed with cancer made her realise that she needed to [[Healing|heal]] herself at a 'deeper' level—concluding that the cancer was due to being angry that her father had not been present in her early years.&lt;ref name="sch46"/&gt; Blumenstein is training her granddaughter to follow in her footsteps in order to be a healer and to know their Yup'ik traditions.&lt;ref name="sch48"/&gt;

==Work as healer and doctor==
After Blumenstein started healing people from the age of 4.&lt;ref name="sch46"/&gt; She "worked at many hospitals delivering babies as a doctor's aide in [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]] and [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]]".&lt;ref name = "nwcollege"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rita carried on learning from her elders to become the first certified traditional doctor in Alaska and presently works for the [[Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium]].&lt;ref&gt;Native Village Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work as a teacher==
Blumenstein has taught in over 150 countries on cultural issues, basket weaving, song, and dance, "earning money for Native American Colleges".&lt;ref name = "nwcollege"/&gt; Her teachings about the "[[Talking circle]]" have been published.&lt;ref name="sch48"/&gt;

==The International Council of 13 Grandmothers==
{{Main|International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers}}
In 2004, Blumenstein was approached by The Center for Sacred Studies to serve on the International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers. The Council has been active in protecting indigenous rights and medicines, and traditional teachings on wisdom.

She was interviewed on her work with the Council by the Women Rising Radio Project in 2011.&lt;ref name = "womenrising"&gt;{{Cite web

==Acclaim within Alaska==
In 2006 both Blumenstein's [[tribe]], the Yup'ik and her [[mayor]] declared the 18 February to be Rita Pitka Blumenstein day.&lt;ref name="sch48"/&gt;

In 2009, Blumenstein was one of fifty women inducted into the inaugural class of the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uaa.alaska.edu/news/alaska-women-hall-of-fame-announces-inaugural-class.cfm|title=Alaska Women's Hall of Fame announces inaugural class|date=March 4, 2009|publisher=University of Alaska Anchorage|accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sit-up''' (or '''curl-up''') is an abdominal endurance training exercise to strengthen and tone the [[Human abdomen|abdominal muscles]]. It is similar to a [[crunch (exercise)|crunch]] (crunches target the [[rectus abdominis]] and also work the [[Abdominal external oblique muscle|external]] and [[Abdominal internal oblique muscle|internal obliques]]), but sit-ups have a fuller range of motion and condition additional muscles.

==Form==

It begins with lying with the back on the floor, typically with the arms across the chest or hands behind the head and the knees bent in an attempt to reduce stress on the back muscles and spine, and then elevating both the upper and lower [[vertebrae]] from the floor until everything superior to the [[buttocks]] is not touching the ground. Some argue that situps can be dangerous due to high compressive lumbar load&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Stuart M. |last1=McGill |title=Stability: from biomechanical concept to chiropractic practice |journal=Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=75–88 |date=June 1999 |pmc=2485366 |pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be replaced with the [[crunch (exercise)|crunch]] in exercise programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGill|first=Stuart|title=Low Back Disorders: Evidence-based Prevention and Rehabilitation|publisher=Human Kinetics Publishers|isbn=978-0-7360-6692-1}}{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength exercises such as sit-ups and [[Press-up|push-up]]s do not cause the [[spot reduction]] of fat. Gaining a "[[Rectus abdominis muscle|six pack]]" requires both abdominal [[muscle hypertrophy]] training and fat loss over the abdomen—which can only be done by losing fat from the body as a whole.&lt;ref name="Kravitz"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Frank I. |last1=Katch |first2=P.

===Variations===
The movement can be made easier by placing the arms further down away from the head. Typical variations to achieve this include crossing the arms to place the palms on the front of the shoulders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sit-up (arms crossed)|url=http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/RectusAbdominis/BWSitUpX.html|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extending the arms down to the sides with palms on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sit-up (arms down)|url=http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/RectusAbdominis/BWSitUpAD.html|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'arms on shoulders' variation is also used to make the incline sit-up&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incline Sit-up (arms crossed)|url=http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/RectusAbdominis/BWInclineSitUpX.html|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; easier.

More intense movement is achieved by doing weighted sit-ups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weighted Sit-up|url=http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/RectusAbdominis/WtSitUp.html|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; incline sit-ups with arms behind neck&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incline Sit-up|url=http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/RectusAbdominis/BWInclineSitUp.html|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even harder by doing the weighted incline sit-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weighted Incline Sit-up (arms crossed)|url=http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/RectusAbdominis/WtInclineSitUpX.html|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health risks==
Full sit-ups may cause back pain and arching of the lower back, increasing the risk of [[back injury]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/abdominal.html Abdominal Training]&lt;/ref&gt; Many experts advise against doing sit-ups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-you-can-stop-doing-sit-ups-1450722637?cx_campaign=poptart&amp;mod=cx_poptart#cxrecs_s Why You Can Stop Doing Sit-Ups], [[The Wall Street Journal]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social therapy''' is an activity-theoretic practice developed outside of academia at the East Side Institute for Group and Short Term Psychotherapy in [[New York City|New York]]. Its primary methodologists are cofounders of the East Side Institute, [[Fred Newman (philosopher)|Fred Newman]] and [[Lois Holzman]]. In evolution since the late 1970s, the social therapeutic approach to human development and learning is informed by a variety of intellectual traditions especially the works of [[Karl Marx]], [[Lev Vygotsky]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. 

Recently, however, the idea of social therapy is being challenged by an organization called Project Toe. Co-founder Mike Bardi challenges the assumption that social therapy is strictly [[Group psychotherapy|group therapy]]. He argues that social therapy is more about, "empowering people to help one another." Group therapy is a form of social therapy, but with the evolution of technology, social therapy is evolving into other forms. These forms include Internet, online therapy, non-professional therapy, and many other forms that redefine the therapeutic process.

Alternatively, the term "social therapy, as used in the [[Camphill Movement]] at [[List of Camphill Communities|Camphill communities]], is used to label a professional discipline inspired by [[Rudolf Steiner]], a philosopher, teacher and the founder of [[anthroposophy]], and put into practice by [[Karl König]]. At its heart is the concept that a healthy social environment is essential for adults with [[Developmental disability|developmental disabilities]] to live productive, independent, and joyful lives. A healthy social environment is cultivated through community where all members make a contribution according to their ability. Establishing necessary spiritual, social and physical conditions for this form of community to thrive is the art and science of social therapy.

The training in social therapy provides practical, emotional, psychological and spiritual tools and insights necessary for living and working with developmentally disabled adults.

==As a psychotherapy==

Social therapy is primarily a group-oriented approach. Its practitioners relate to the group, rather than individuals, as the fundamental unit of development. Social therapy is also premised on an understanding of human beings as fundamentally performers. This is in contrast to more traditional forms of therapy that relate to and understand human beings through the lens of behavior.  Social therapy shares family resemblances with [[narrative therapy]] and the [[postmodern]] therapies.

== "Therapy cult" allegations ==
{{Main|Fred Newman (philosopher)#"Therapy Cult" allegations}}

In 1977, Dennis King, writing for ''Heights and Valley News'', penned an article which alleged Newman was the leader of a "[[therapy cult]]."[30] ''The Public Eye'' magazine also carried an article in late 1977 making this claim, though it was primarily directed at [[Lyndon LaRouche]]'s [[National Caucus of Labor Committees|NCLC]] (with which Newman was no longer affiliated).[31] At the time, Newman responded that, "it is of the greatest importance that the entire community of social scientists insist that there be open and critical discussion and dialogue towards the advancement and development of the human sciences; that as scientists and as professionals we do not quiver and shake under the socio-pathological and essentially anti-communist rampages of a Dennis King or others like him."[32] Cult allegations arose again a few years later in the ''Village Voice''.[33]

When political researcher [[Chip Berlet]] became editor of ''The Public Eye'' magazine in 1984, he first announced that the magazine no longer held to that characterization:

"As you will learn from a forthcoming article on Fred Newman and the IWP, the Public Eye no longer feels it is accurate to call Newman's political network a cult. We do feel that at one point in its development it was fair to characterize the group as a cult, and we still have strong criticisms of the group's organizing style and the relationship between Newman's Therapy Institute and his political organizing." (Editor's Note, Public Eye, 1984; Vol. 4, Nos. 3-4)

===Youth development===
Social therapy has influenced youth development, most notably supplemental education.  The All Stars Project, founded by social therapist Fred Newman and developmental psychologist [[Lenora Fulani]] in 1981 produced a variety of programs inspired by social therapy.  The All Stars Talent Show Network, an anti-violence program in cities around the United States and in Europe, engages young people in the production of talents shows.  Social therapy has also influenced youth development in the arena of school mental health. Social therapy can be considered psychotherapy.

'''St John Ambulance''' is a volunteer-led, [[Charitable organization#United Kingdom|charitable]] [[non-governmental organisation]] dedicated to the teaching and practice of [[first aid]] in [[England]]. Along with [[St John Ambulance in Wales|St John Cymru Wales]] and [[St John Ambulance Northern Ireland]], St John Ambulance is one of three affiliates of the international [[St John International|St John]] movement in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Where we work: Europe and Middle East |url=https://www.stjohninternational.org/Pages/Category/europe |work=Order of St John |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The St John Ambulance Association was founded in 1877 to provide first aid training. In 1887, the St John Ambulance Brigade was founded to provide uniformed medics at public events. In 1968, the two were merged into the present foundation.&lt;ref name="jerseyhistory"&gt;[http://www.stjohnambulancejersey.com/_bluebox/A_brief_history_of_St_John_Ambulance_Jersey-attachment=12FC.pdf A brief history of St John Ambulance in Jersey]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation is a subsidiary of the England and the Islands priory (i.e. branch) of the [[Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)|Order of St John]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1077265|The Priory of England and the Islands of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2012, it also managed St John Ambulance services in the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Channel Islands]].&lt;ref name="Ainsworth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/st-john-ambulance-made-155-redundancies-last-year-annual-report-reveals/finance/article/1207944 |title=St John Ambulance made 155 redundancies last year, annual report reveals |date=20 August 2013 |first=David |last=Ainsworth |work=Third Sector |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The St John Ambulance Association was set up in 1877 by the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]] to teach industrial workers first aid, so that they could provide on-the-spot treatment in emergencies. Workers rarely had ready access to a doctor in 19th century workplaces, and since accidents were frequent, death or disability from injuries were common. The St John Ambulance Association set up training sessions across the country, particularly in workplaces in areas of heavy industry, but also in villages, seaside towns and suburban areas.

In 1887, trained volunteers were organised into a uniformed Brigade to provide a first aid and ambulance service at public events. In many parts of England (and in parts of Scotland, until 1908), St John Ambulance was the first and only provider of an ambulance service right up to the middle of the 20th century, when the National Health Service was founded. When there were far fewer doctors and hospital beds than today, St John Ambulance nurses looked after the sick and injured in their own homes.

The St John Ambulance Brigade and St John Ambulance Association merged in 1968&lt;ref name="jerseyhistory"/&gt; to form St John Ambulance, a single organisation providing both training and first aid cover.

During 2013, St John Ambulance trained approximately 278,000 adults through its workplace and community first aid programmes, and directly trained 91,000 schoolchildren. St John Ambulance personnel attended 45,000 public events, treating approximately 102,000 individuals. It also distributed 100,000 free first aid guides nationwide and its free smartphone app was downloaded by 148,000 people.&lt;ref name="annualreports"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/about-us/annual-reports.aspx |title=Annual reports and reviews |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First aid cover at events==
[[File:London Legal Walk (14231648822).jpg|thumb|Cycle Response Units (CRUs) providing cover at an event in London in 2014.]]
St John Ambulance provides first aid cover at thousands of events every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/what-we-do1.aspx|title=What we do - St John Ambulance|work=www.sja.org.uk|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; This service is provided free at the point of delivery, although a charge may be made to the event organiser for provision of the service at their event.

In addition to providing volunteer first aiders for events, where necessary St John Ambulance can provide paramedics, doctors, nurses and cycle responders, as well as mobile treatment centres, [[ambulance]]s and other medical provision.&lt;ref name="annualreports"/&gt; Alongside support functions including command &amp; control vehicles and incident catering units.

The organisation covers many major events across England including the [[London Marathon]] and [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] concerts, as well as smaller and charitable events such as fetes and local fairs.&lt;ref name="annualreports"/&gt;

==Training==
St John Ambulance runs courses in first aid and health &amp; safety for members of the public, training 254,000 people in 2013.&lt;ref name="annualreports"/&gt; Its ''First aid at work'' course is used by many companies to train designated individuals as first-aiders, as required by employment laws; specialist training is also available, including courses for schools staff and people working with children, and professional drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=First aid and health and safety training courses |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/first-aid-training-courses.aspx |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charitable ''Community first aid'' courses also offer people of all ages the chance to learn basic first aid skills at little or no charge. In 2013, 24,000 people attended these courses.&lt;ref name="annualreports"/&gt;

== Work with young people ==
St John Ambulance teaches first aid to thousands of young people, through programmes including Badgers (for seven- to ten-year-olds), [[St John Ambulance Cadets in the UK|Cadets]] (10 to 17-year-olds), LINKS (based in colleges and universities)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Youth programmes at St John Ambulance |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/young-people.aspx |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and RISE, a specialist project aimed at those not in education, employment or training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RISE to the challenge – realise your potential |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/young-people/rise.aspx |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cadets volunteer alongside their adult counterparts on events, making St John Ambulance the only youth organisation to have their young people utilizing their skills in the "real world" with real patients.

In 2013, 91,000 schoolchildren were trained in first aid by St John Ambulance's schools team, while hundreds of thousands more had access to the organisation's training materials for schools, which are available to download for free from its ''Teach the difference'' website.&lt;ref name="annualreports"/&gt;

In 2014, the organisation also launched The Big First Aid Lesson, a free first aid lesson, which was streamed live into classrooms across England. 32,384 students took part in the inaugural event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Big First Aid Lesson |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/young-people/schools/the-big-first-aid-lesson.aspx |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events took place the following 3 years. The Big First Aid Lesson was not held in 2018, to allow the team to focus on promoting first aid as part of the national curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sja.org.uk/sja/schools.aspx|title=School First Aid Resources &amp; Lesson Plans {{!}} St John Ambulance|work=www.sja.org.uk|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Super Badger Award===
St John Ambulance Badgers work towards the 'Super Badger Award'. This award consists of members completing 12 subjects, such as 'Creative', 'Global' and 'Wild' Badger. The award is split into five sections, where Badgers advance through completing more subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=St John Ambulance Badger Programme |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/young-people/badgers/the-badger-programme.aspx |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badgers who achieve their Super Badger receive a ceramic trophy of Bertie Badger, the Badger mascot, dressed in the original Badger uniform. The programme was completely reviewed, redesigned in 2016 and was launched in 2017, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the formation of Badgers.

===Grand Prior Award scheme===
The [[Grand Prior Award]] is the primary award designed for [[St John Ambulance Cadets in the UK|cadets]]. The award is an essential part of Cadet life, and consists of completion of 24 subject areas over the period of Cadet membership, until the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St John Ambulance Grand Prior Award Scheme |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/young-people/cadets/grand-prior-award.aspx |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme started being reviewed and updated in early 2017 and is due for release in mid-2019.

===Amalfi Challenge===
The Amalfi Award was open to all Cadets and adult volunteers aged 16 to 25. The structure of the award focussed on personal task set by the individual. These tasks were categorised into service, relationships, society and challenge. Each participant had to undertake 12 tasks and at completion of 4, 8 and 12 subjects a badge was awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=St John Ambulance Amalfi Challenge |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/young-people/amalfi-challenge.aspx |website=St John Ambulance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226073351/http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/young-people/amalfi-challenge.aspx |archivedate=26 February 2015 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Amalfi Challenge is discontinued in England.

===The Sovereign's Award===
The Sovereign’s Award is the premier achievement for young people, 16-25, within the Order of St John worldwide. The award, which includes a certificate personally signed by the Sovereign Head of the Order, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, is given to young St John Ambulance volunteers in recognition of outstanding work in the areas of personal development, benefit to St John, and benefit to their community. The award is awarded to a maximum of 10 people worldwide, annually.

The awards are presented at the Young Achievers' Reception hosted by Her Royal Highness [[The Princess Royal]], Commandant-in-Chief for Youth. The event is also attended by the National Cadet of the Year for England and the Islands, National Cadet of the Year for Cymru-Wales, Regional Cadets of the Year from England and the Islands, Deputy Cadet of the Year for Cymru-Wales, District Cadets of the Year and nominated young people, aged 7-17.

===LINKS units===
St John Ambulance units dedicated to meeting the needs of student and [[university]] communities can be found at many institutes of higher education across England. These units, known as LINKS units, were originally established at universities to form a 'link' between Cadets and adult volunteering, allowing people to stay affiliated to the organisation and maintain their skills while in higher education. However, LINKS units have become integral parts of the student community and the 90% of LINKS members are new to St John Ambulance at the point of joining, as students that are new to university look for societies to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=University student volunteering |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/volunteer/first-aid/students-in-higher-education.aspx |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigning and awareness-raising==
St John Ambulance campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of first aid, and equip more people with life-saving skills. Its 2013 Save the Boy campaign, which featured an interactive element, demonstrating how to put a casualty in the recovery position, reached 15 million people through television and online media.&lt;ref name="annualreports"/&gt;

In January 2015, it launched a new campaign, The Chokeables, designed to teach parents how to treat a choking infant. The animated film featured the voices of actors [[John Hurt]], [[David Walliams]], [[Johnny Vegas]] and [[David Mitchell (comedian)|David Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/thework/1328925/st-john-ambulance-the-chokeables-bartle-bogle-hegarty/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH |title=St John Ambulance "the chokeables" by Bartle Bogle Hegarty |magazine=[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]] |date=13 January 2015 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the annual Save a Life September campaign, St John Ambulance trainers hold free first aid demonstrations in public spaces around the country, handing out first aid guides to attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Learn-life-saving-skills-free-St-John-Ambulance/story-22952906-detail/story.html |title=Learn life saving skills for free with St John Ambulance |first=Gemma |last=Taylor |newspaper=[[Leicester Mercury]] |date=19 September 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A free first aid app for smartphones is also available to download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/12/st-john-ambulance-calls-football-fans-learn-first-aid-skills-celebrate-like-hero |title=St John Ambulance calls on football fans to learn first aid skills |first=Stuart |last=Goodwin |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 September 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 9-16 October 2018, St John Ambulance was a nationwide-leader in the promotion of Restart A Heart Day 2018, overseen by the [[Resuscitation Council (UK)|Resuscitation Council UK]], on behalf of the [[European Resuscitation Council]] and the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]]. Alongside partner organisations, St John Ambulance trained over 200,000, over the two weeks, in emergency resuscitation.

==Ambulance services==
[[File:Cats ambulance.JPG|thumb|(CATS 1) St John Ambulance]]
St John Ambulance is a leading supplier of ambulance services in England, providing patient transport services to over 100,000 people year, and working in partnership with NHS trusts, private healthcare groups, local authorities and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ambulance Operations |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/what-we-do/ambulance-services.aspx |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Services offered include A&amp;E support, patient transport, bariatric transfer, paediatric and neonatal services, high-dependency transfers, planned journeys, repatriations, community first response and emergency response and major incident support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sja.org.uk/sja/what-we-do/ambulance-operations.aspx|title=Ambulance operations – St John Ambulance|work=www.sja.org.uk|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, St John Ambulance was awarded the Private Ambulance Service Team of the Year Award by the Ambulance Services Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gordon-yates.co.uk/news/article.asp?article=59 |title=Training the best at St John Ambulance |work=Gordon Yates |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406024839/http://gordon-yates.co.uk/News/article.asp?article=59 |archivedate=6 April 2016 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the work it carried out with the [[Children's Acute Transport Service|CATS]] ([[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Great Ormond Street]]) and the South Thames Retrieval Service ([[Evelina London Children's Hospital|Evelina Children's Hospital]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.evelinalondon.nhs.uk/our-services/hospital/south-thames-retrieval-service/overview.aspx|title=South Thames Retrieval Service|website=www.evelinalondon.nhs.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First aid and medical equipment services==
St John Ambulance Supplies (often abbreviated to SJS) is a trading sub-division of St John Ambulance providing first aid and medical equipment and consumables, training equipment, publications, health and safety equipment and clothing. Where a profit is made, surplus from sales are diverted into supporting the charitable work of the [[Venerable Order of St John|Order of St John]] and the St John Ophthalmic Hospital in Jerusalem.

SJS opened its doors at St John’s Gate in Clerkenwell on 12 February 1879 and was originally known as The Stores Depot. It is now a major commercial operation supplying to the public, private and voluntary sector. The store is now only available online.

==Vehicles==
[[File:saint.john.ambulance.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|250px|St John Ambulance Crusader ambulance in a London street.]] 
As individual (local) Divisions of St John Ambulance have historically been responsible for providing their own vehicles, these have taken many and varied forms, beginning with horse-drawn ambulances. Even into the late twentieth century, with some centralisation of control and classification of vehicle types such as Motor Ambulance Units (the title arising historically as a distinction from horse-drawn units), First Aid Posts and Rapid Deployment Vehicles, there remained within the organisation an enormous range of deployed vehicles of different types and even assorted local vehicle liveries. Some ambulances were donated second-hand from industrial plants, some were purchased (from different suppliers) and some were local conversions of commercial vehicles. At the start of the twenty-first century, new legislation regarding emergency ambulances effectively rendered a significant proportion of the then current St John Ambulance fleet redundant. The solution was the development of a specialist St John Ambulance vehicle, which was designed jointly by the organisation and vehicle manufacturer [[Renault]]. The result was the Crusader 900 ambulance.

An early assessment suggested that 100 of the Crusader ambulances (costing, at that time, £40,000 each) would be required immediately, representing an investment of £4 million. In 2000, St John Ambulance committed itself to raising £2 million by public subscription, whilst English and Welsh [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] committed a further £2 million, supplying 50 Crusader ambulances which were handed over in local ceremonies across the country during 2000 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gandhmark.org/PublicPages/StJohnsAmbulance.aspx |title=Mark Masonry and Charitable Giving |website=Mark Lodges Gloucestershire &amp; Herefordshire |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726072949/http://www.gandhmark.org/PublicPages/StJohnsAmbulance.aspx |archivedate=26 July 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.durhamfreemasons.org/Mark/Charity.html |title=Mark Benevolent Fund |website=Mark Master Masons of County Durham |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314162528/http://durhamfreemasons.org/mark/charity.html |archivedate=14 March 2012 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This very large donation allowed the rapid transformation of the national St John Ambulance fleet of front-line ambulances within a much shorter time-scale than could otherwise have been possible. Subsequently, many local Provinces of Freemasons have maintained relations with their local St John Ambulance County units and supported the running costs of these vehicles or even donated further (additional) Crusader ambulances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hertsmark.org/mainpages/newssum2005.htm |title=The New Mark Ambulance |website=Provincial Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons of Hertfordshire |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021162653/http://www.hertsmark.org/mainpages/newssum2005.htm |archivedate=21 October 2007 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2004, the national St John Ambulance emergency vehicle fleet was in a standard corporate livery, with standard vehicle types:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The New Driving Force |author=St John Ambulance Supplies Department |date=June 2004 |publisher=SJS |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SJAVehicles.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Image showing the various vehicles St John Use (Left to Right: 2 Crusaders, a Challenger, a Companion Plus and 2 further Crusaders)]]
* '''Crusader''' – a front-line emergency ambulance, based on the [[Renault Master]] (or similar);
* '''4x4 Ambulance''' – a 4-wheel drive emergency ambulance, based on the [[Nissan Patrol]] (or similar), but with additional headroom, for rural and off-road deployment;
* '''Support Vehicle''' – either based on a van, car or a 4x4 vehicle, Support Units can be used for a variety of purposes. For instance, a Support Car may be used to carry members to and from duties, in a logistical capacity, or even as a response vehicle on larger duties. Support Vans are normally used only for logistical purposes. Mini-buses are also available, and can be used for logistics or the transport of members.

===Specialist vehicles===
St John Ambulance also maintains specialist response options in particular locations, such as Cycle Response Units, control and command units, as well as larger vehicles or trailers used as static first aid posts.

==Volunteers==
The majority of St John Ambulance's volunteers deliver first aid at events and as Community First Responders or work with young people as youth leaders. Other specialist roles are available for healthcare professionals, volunteer managers and in safeguarding, human resources, quality and assurance and health and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/volunteer.aspx |title=Volunteer with St John Ambulance |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Training and skills ===
Volunteers receive training according to the role they fulfill. Those volunteering to provide Event First Aid services are offered a number of first aid qualifications, ranging from a basic emergency life support course and the further first aid modules, which deal with common injuries and ailments, through to Emergency Transport Attendant training which covers some of the competencies of the [[National Health Service]] Ambulance Technicians. 

The training for those delivering Youth Services comprises emergency life support training, coupled with training from the organisation's own youth leader training suite including Essential skills in youth work and Leadership skills in youth work, depending on the volunteer's role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://member.sja.org.uk/ylt/Default.asp |title=St John Ambulance Youth leader training suite |website=St John Ambulance| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203025604/http://member.sja.org.uk/ylt/Default.asp |archivedate=3 December 2013 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to medical training offered, members have the opportunity to carry out other operational roles. These include event planning, event management, radio communications/control, plus other support roles.

=== Healthcare professionals ===
Qualified healthcare professionals may also volunteer their time in St John Ambulance including nurses, paramedics and doctors. All healthcare professionals have their qualifications and professional status checked with the appropriate regulatory body before practising in St John Ambulance. Professionals can carry out any skill appropriate to their type, level of training, competence and when relevant to the situation or patient. Healthcare professionals wear [[St John Ambulance Ranks and Insignia|coloured rank slides]] to distinguish them from internally trained first aiders and ambulance personnel. 

With the exception of Paramedics, any HCP wishing to work on an ambulance though must become a Patient Transport Attendant / Emergency Trasport Attendant, but parts of the training may be omitted if the candidate can attain accreditation of prior learning. This is dependent on the HCP's professional training already undertaken. This is to ensure that the HCP is prepared for working in an ambulance/emergency environment (which they may never have done).

Student HCPs who are on duty with an Event HCP (nurse, doctor or paramedic) may be mentored/supervised by that Event HCP to provide out of hospital care. However, they must undertake the same training in operational clinical practice as all other volunteers through First Aider to Emergency Trasport Attendant and can only operate on duty at events to the scope of their SJA training when working unsupervised, in absence of an event HCP.

==Structure==
In 2012, St John Ambulance was reorganised into a regional structure, with the goal of increasing accountability and maximising charitable outputs.&lt;ref name="sja.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/pdf/Order-of-St-John-Annual-report-2012.pdf |title=Order of St John Annual report 2012 |website=St John Ambulance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193333/http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/pdf/Order-of-St-John-Annual-report-2012.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until that point the organisation had been divided into 42 semi-autonomous counties.

As part of the reorganisation, a more streamlined structure was introduced, with fewer layers of management between the front-line and the St John Ambulance Board.

===St John Ambulance regions===
The current 4 regions are:
* '''East''', made up of the [[East Midlands]] and the [[East of England]]
* '''London &amp; South''', made up of [[London]] and the [[South East]]
* '''North''', made up of the [[North East]] and [[North West England|North West]]
* '''West''', made up of the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] and [[South West England|South West]]

Each region is managed by a paid regional director, and is responsible for the delivery of programmes developed and overseen by National Headquarters. All regions are accountable to the [[Care Quality Commission]] and are independently inspected by the CQC against 14 different outcomes, such as care and welfare of people who use the services, cleanliness and infection control and supporting workers.&lt;ref name="annualreports"/&gt;

During regionalisation in 2012, St John Ambulance in [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]] became separate from England.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth"/&gt;

===District===
The region is divided into a number of districts. A district may contain one or more former "counties" from the previous structure and may only have part of a county in. Each district is managed by a district manager (volunteer), and area managers report to them. District managers are in overall charge of all activities in their district, assisted by the area managers. They have a support team of district specialists in place coordinating functions such as event cover and youth provision, but they have no line management responsibility and report to their respective regional departmental manager. Each district usually contains 3–6 areas.

===Area===
Districts are further divided into geographic areas, led by an area manager (volunteer). Unit managers report to the area manager, and the area manager is in overall charge of the activities of the units in their area, within the boundaries of policies etc. set by Regional Headquarters (RHQ) and NHQ. They are assisted/advised by district specialists to provide the day-to-day functions of the organisation, such as member training and event cover. Each area contains about 8–15 units.

===Unit===
A unit (formerly a "division") is the smallest administrative division of St John Ambulance. Most volunteers are managed within a unit and by a unit manager (volunteer). Units traditionally were ambulance divisions (for men), nursing divisions (for women) and ambulance cadet divisions and nursing cadet divisions for boys and girls respectively. 

In modern times, no single-sex divisions remain and most are either historically termed 'combined division' or 'quadrilateral division'.

Other types of local units exist, such as [[St John Ambulance (England)#Youth services|Badger Setts]] (for 5- to 10-year-olds) and specialised units such as cycle response units, LINKS units within universities and sometimes informal social groups, each with a distinctive command, management or leadership structure. Specilised units are sometimes "virtual units" meaning the unit doesn't physically meet on a regular basis, but works over the internet etc.

The unit manager may have one or more assistant unit managers to assist them. The unit usually has a weekly meeting where members train, practice their skills, and occasionally have visits from guest speakers. Youth units (badgers and [[St John Ambulance Cadets in the UK|cadets]]) follow the St John Ambulance youth programme. Units plan and execute the cover of most of the events requested of the organisation, supported by their area and district managers, district specialists and regional events team. Units are where most people start their time in the organisation.

== Uniform and ranks ==
{{main|St John Ambulance Ranks and Insignia}}[[File:London Marathon 2014 - First aiders (04).jpg|thumb|Personnel in the current uniform (centre and right) and the ceremonial uniform (left).]]
St John Ambulance first aid personnel wear a service delivery uniform consisting of a green shirt; black combat trousers; and either a green and black Parka Jacket, a reversible fleece, or green and black softshell jacket with appropriate black footwear. [[Epaulette|Epaulettes]] on the shirts vary in colour dependent on the profession of the volunteer: Black for first aid personnel, green for registered paramedics, grey for registered nurses, and red for registered doctors. Healthcare professionals' (HCPs) epaulettes don't show specialism such as midwives. Student HCPs wear black epaulettes until they're qualified in their respective profession.  

On the service delivery uniform, a role bar is worn to denote the wearer's role on that event.  High-visibility two-tone yellow-and-green tabards (accepted to denote medical personnel) are only worn when the risk assessment of the event calls for it. 

Badgers wear a branded black polo-shirt and a branded black jumper, where they can wear the badges they earn through the Super Badger programme.  

Cadets wear the same uniform as their adult counterparts, though are permitted to wear a brassard on their left arm where they're able to show their current/highest Grand Prior Award badge at the top-centre; up to three badges, including duty hours, Duke of Edinburgh Award, Sovereign's Award, national competitons winners badge, Amalfi Challenge (discontinued) or Diana Award (if won for services to St John Ambulance); and the Super Badger award (if achieved) at the bottom of the brassard. 

A ceremonial uniform still exists for adult volunteers, consisting of a peaked cap, tailored jacket, white shirt, black trousers, black shoes and clip-on tie. All rank insignia are worn on the outer layer of the jacket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sja.org.uk/shop/pdf/Looking%20the%20part%20catalogue%202013.pdf |title=St John Ambulance uniform catalogue |year=2013 |website=St John Ambulance |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== St John Ambulance in the British armed forces ==
A section of St John Ambulance, St John Ambulance British Forces Overseas (SJABFO), has British units running where there are a large amount of British servicemen and women with their families overseas. These are namely in Cyprus, with units in Germany beginning to close in preparation for the British withdrawal from Germany in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/deployments/germany/|title=Germany|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divisions are directly linked to the UK and national headquarters so that members can transfer to another unit or region/district/area as they would be able to do at home. Cyprus and Germany are a part of St John Ambulance as two districts, unattached to any region, within the organisational structure. The uniform reflects the current service delivery uniform in England.

Volunteers can receive training in the full range of St John Ambulance qualifications.

The overseas forces units (then "divisions") were founded in 1980. They remained very strong for several years, however, as the forces in Germany were reduced many divisions closed. Since the final withdrawal of forces in Germany is expected in the next few years, the role for St John Ambulance will end. However the two units in Cyprus founded in 1991 will continue to provide a service to the community there.

As well as providing medical cover at events, St John Ambulance British Forces provides first-aid training for people of all ages.

St John Ambulance British Forces Overseas works closely with the German Ambulance Services, particularly the sister organisation, [[Die Johanniter]], in providing first aid and ambulance cover German public events where many British or English Speakers are expected to attend. Members can occasionally be seen on their non-emergency ''and'' emergency vehicles responding to public calls. St John Ambulance can also be seen working with [[Order of Malta|Malteser]], the [[German Red Cross]] and local fire brigades which provide ambulance services. The German Emergency Services also assist St John Ambulance at British events on military areas where many German civilians are expected to attend. With the planned withdrawral of British forces from Germany in 2019, this partnership, in this aspect at least, will be discontinued.

== Relations with the Order of St John and other organisations ==
Although the [[Venerable Order of St John|Order of St John]] is largely seen as a Christian organisation for historical reasons, St John Ambulance does not restrict membership to nor promote any particular religion or denomination. Technically, it falls under the sovereignty of [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]], and thus is linked to the [[Church of England]]; however, this relationship is more tradition than authority, and adult members are not required to pledge allegiance to or support either the monarchy or the Christian faith. Historically, Cadet members made a pledge upon joining to the monarch and to God, though was reviewed and no longer a requirement.

St John Ambulance works alongside St John organisations across the world as part of St John International.[https://www.stjohninternational.org/]

Both organisations work support the statutory services in times of civil emergency or crisis. In peacetime, St John Ambulance is senior to the Red Cross however during wartime, the Red Cross would become senior due to an agreement with the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36044">'''Stress management''' is a wide spectrum of techniques and [[psychotherapy|psychotherapies]] aimed at controlling a person's level of [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], especially [[chronic stress]], usually for the purpose of improving everyday functioning. In this context, the term 'stress' refers only to a stress with significant negative consequences, or [[distress (medicine)|distress]] in the terminology advocated by [[Hans Selye]], rather than what he calls [[eustress]], a stress whose consequences are helpful or otherwise.

Stress produces numerous physical and mental symptoms which vary according to each individual's situational factors. These can include physical health decline as well as [[Depression (mood)|depression]].  The process of stress management is named as one of the keys to a happy and successful life in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.psychtreatment.com/stress_management.htm | title=Stress Management: What can you do? | publisher=St. Louis Psychologists and Counseling Information and Referral | accessdate=February 5, 2013 | author=Paul Susic MA Licensed Psychologist Candidate | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124092537/http://www.psychtreatment.com/stress_management.htm | archivedate=January 24, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although life provides numerous demands that can prove difficult to handle, stress management provides a number of ways to manage anxiety and maintain overall well-being.

Despite stress often being thought of as a subjective experience, levels of stress are readily measurable, using various physiological tests, similar to those used in [[polygraph]]s.

Many practical stress management techniques are available, some for use by [[health professional]]s and others, for [[self-help]], which may help an individual reduce their levels of stress, provide positive feelings of control over one's life and promote general [[well-being]]. Other stress reducing techniques involve adding a daily exercise routine, finding a hobby, writing your thoughts, feelings, and moods down and also speaking with a trusted one about what is bothering you. It is very important to keep in mind that not all techniques are going to work the same for everyone, that is why trying different stress managing techniques is crucial in order to find what techniques work best for you. An example of this would be, two people on a roller coaster one can be screaming grabbing on to the bar while the other could be laughing while their hands are up in the air (Nisson). This is a perfect example of how stress effects everyone differently that is why they might need a different treatment. These techniques do not require doctors approval but seeing if a doctors technique works better for you is also very important. 

Evaluating the effectiveness of various stress management techniques can be difficult, as limited research currently exists. Consequently, the amount and quality of evidence for the various techniques varies widely. Some are accepted as effective treatments for use in [[psychotherapy]], while others with less evidence favoring them are considered [[alternative medicine|alternative therapies]].  Many professional organizations exist to promote and provide training in conventional or alternative therapies.

There are several [[Scientific modelling|model]]s of stress management, each with distinctive explanations of mechanisms for controlling stress.  Much more research is necessary to provide a better understanding of which mechanisms actually operate and are effective in practice.

==Historical foundations==
[[Walter Cannon]] and [[Hans Selye]] used animal studies to establish the earliest scientific basis for the study of stress. They measured the physiological responses of animals to external pressures, such as heat and cold, prolonged restraint, and surgical procedures, then extrapolated from these studies to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, W. (1939). The Wisdom of the Body, 2nd ed., NY: Norton Pubs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Selye, H| year=1950| title=Stress and the general adaptation syndrome| journal=Br. Med. J.| volume=1| pages=1383–92| pmid=15426759| issue=4667| pmc=2038162| doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4667.1383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent studies of stress in humans by Richard Rahe and others established the view that stress is caused by distinct, measurable life stressors, and further, that these life stressors can be ranked by the median degree of stress they produce (leading to the [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale]]). Thus, stress was traditionally conceptualized to be a result of external insults beyond the control of those experiencing the stress. More recently, however, it has been argued that external circumstances do not have any intrinsic capacity to produce stress, but instead their effect is mediated by the individual's perceptions, capacities, and understanding.

==Models==

The generalized models are:
* [[Fight-or-flight response|The emergency response/fight-or-flight response]] by Walter Cannon (1914, 1932)
* [[Stress_(biology)#General_adaptation_syndrome|General Adaptation Syndrome]] by Hans Selye (1936)
* Stress Model of Henry
* Transactional (or cognitive) Stress Model / stress model of Lazarus after Lazarus (1974)
* [[Conservation of resources theory|Theory of resource conservation]] by Stevan Hobfoll (1988, 1998; Hobfoll &amp; Buchwald, 2004)

===Transactional model===
[[File:Transactional Model of Stress and Coping - Richard Lazarus.svg|thumb|Transactional Model of Stress and Coping of Richard Lazarus]]
[[Richard Lazarus]] and Susan Folkman suggested in 1981 that stress can be thought of as resulting from an "imbalance between demands and resources" or as occurring when "pressure exceeds one's perceived ability to cope". Stress management was developed and premised on the idea that stress is not a direct response to a stressor but rather one's resources and ability to cope mediate the stress response and are amenable to change, thus allowing stress to be controllable.&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, R.S., &amp; Folkman, S. (1984). Stress, Appraisal and Coping. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many stressors mentioned by employees, these are the most common:
* Conflicts in company
* The way employees are treated by their bosses/supervisors or company
* Lack of job security
* Company policies
* Co-workers who don't do their fair share
* Unclear expectations
* Poor communication
* Not enough control over assignments
* Inadequate pay or benefits
* Urgent deadlines
* Too much work
* Long hours
* Uncomfortable physical conditions
* Relationship conflicts
* Co-workers making careless mistakes

In order to develop an effective stress management program it is first necessary to identify the factors that are central to a person controlling his/her stress, and to identify the intervention methods which effectively target these factors. Lazarus and Folkman's interpretation of stress focuses on the transaction between people and their external environment (known as the Transactional Model). The model contends that stress may not be a stressor if the person does not perceive the stressor as a threat but rather as positive or even challenging. Also, if the person possesses or can use adequate [[coping skills]], then stress may not actually be a result or develop because of the stressor. The model proposes that people can be taught to manage their stress and cope with their stressors. They may learn to change their perspective of the stressor and provide them with the ability and confidence to improve their lives and handle all of types of stressors.

===Health realization/innate health model===
The health realization/innate health model of stress is also founded on the idea that stress does not necessarily follow the presence of a potential stressor. Instead of focusing on the individual's appraisal of so-called stressors in relation to his or her own coping skills (as the transactional model does), the health realization model focuses on the nature of thought, stating that it is ultimately a person's thought processes that determine the response to potentially stressful external circumstances. In this model, stress results from appraising oneself and one's circumstances through a mental filter of insecurity and negativity, whereas a feeling of [[Well being|well-being]] results from approaching the world with a "quiet mind".&lt;ref&gt;Mills, R.C. (1995). ''Realizing Mental Health: Toward a new Psychology of Resiliency.'' Sulberger &amp; Graham Publishing, Ltd. {{ISBN|0-945819-78-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sedgeman, J.A. (2005). Health Realization/Innate Health: Can a quiet mind and a positive feeling state be accessible over the lifespan without stress-relief techniques? Med. Sci. Monitor 11(12) HY47-52. {{cite web |url=http://www.medscimonit.com/fulltxt.php?IDMAN=8224 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925220423/http://www.medscimonit.com/fulltxt.php?IDMAN=8224 |archivedate=2012-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model proposes that helping stressed individuals understand the nature of thought—especially providing them with the ability to recognize when they are in the grip of insecure thinking, disengage from it, and access natural positive feelings—will reduce their stress.

==Techniques==
High demand levels load the person with extra effort and work. A new [[time management|time schedule]] is worked up, and until the period of abnormally high, personal demand has passed, the normal frequency and duration of former schedules is limited.

Many techniques [[Coping skill|cope]] with the stresses life brings. Some of the following ways reduce a lower than usual stress level, temporarily, to compensate the [[biological]] issues involved; others face the [[stressor]] at a higher level of abstraction:

===Stress prevention and resilience===
Although many techniques have traditionally been developed to deal with the consequences of stress, considerable research has also been conducted on the prevention of stress, a subject closely related to [[Psychological resilience|psychological resilience-building]].  A number of self-help approaches to stress-prevention and resilience-building have been developed, drawing mainly on the theory and practice of cognitive-behavioral therapy.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2012"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=Build your Resilience| year=2012| publisher=Hodder| location=London| isbn=978-1444168716|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwIstsEgkBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measuring stress===
Levels of stress can be measured. One way is through the use of psychological testing: ''The [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]]'' [two scales of measuring stress] is used to rate stressful life events, while the [[DASS (psychology)|DASS]] [Depression Anxiety Stress Scales] contains a scale for stress based on self-report items. Changes in [[blood pressure]] and [[galvanic skin response]] can also be measured to test stress levels, and changes in stress levels. A [[digital thermometer]] can be used to evaluate changes in skin temperature, which can indicate activation of the [[fight-or-flight response]] drawing blood away from the extremities. Cortisol is the main hormone released during a stress response and measuring cortisol from hair will give a 60- to 90-day baseline stress level of an individual.  This method of measuring stress is currently the most popular method in the clinic.

===Effectiveness===
Stress management has physiological and immune benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bower, J.

==Types of stress==

===Acute stress===
Acute stress is the most common form of stress among humans worldwide.

Acute stress deals with the pressures of the near future or dealing with the very recent past. This type of stress is often misinterpreted for being a negative connotation. While this is the case in some circumstances, it is also a good thing to have some acute stress in life. Running or any other form of exercise is considered an acute stressor. Some exciting or exhilarating experiences such as riding a roller coaster is an acute stress but is usually very enjoyable. Acute stress is a short term stress and as a result, does not have enough time to do the damage that long term stress causes.&lt;ref name=acute&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGonagle|first=Katherine|author2=Ronald Kessler |title=Chronic Stress, Acute Stress, Depressive Symptoms|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|date=October 1990|volume=18|issue=5|pages=681–706|doi=10.1007/BF00931237|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/44026/1/10464_2004_Article_BF00931237.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronic stress===
[[Chronic stress]] is unlike acute stress. It has a wearing effect on people that can become a very serious health risk if it continues over a long period of time. Chronic stress can lead to memory loss, damage spatial recognition and produce a decreased drive of eating. The severity varies from person to person and also gender difference can be an underlying factor. Women are able to take longer durations of stress than men without showing the same maladaptive changes. Men can deal with shorter stress duration better than women can but once males hit a certain threshold, the chances of them developing mental issues increases drastically.&lt;ref name=hormones&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowman|first=Rachel|title=Chronic Stress Effects on Memory: Sex differences in performance|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=January 2003|volume=43|issue=1|pages=48–59|doi=10.1016/S0018-506X(02)00022-3|last2=Beck|first2=Kevin D|last3=Luine|first3=Victoria N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace==
Stress in the workplace is a commonality throughout the world in every business.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Managing that stress becomes vital in order to keep up [[job performance]] as well as relationship with co-workers and employers.&lt;ref name=Dailybsness.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybsness.com/en-wiki/7_tips_to_prevent_and_reduce_work_stress |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310012706/http://www.dailybsness.com/en-wiki/7_tips_to_prevent_and_reduce_work_stress |archivedate=2016-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For some workers, changing the work environment relieves work stress. Making the environment less competitive between employees decreases some amounts of stress. However, each person is different and some people like the pressure to perform better.

Salary can be an important concern of employees. Salary can affect the way people work because they can aim for promotion and in result, a higher salary. This can lead to chronic stress.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Cultural differences have also shown to have some major effects on stress coping problems. Eastern Asian employees may deal with certain work situations differently from how a Western North American employee would.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In order to manage stress in the workplace, employers can provide stress managing programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofai.co.uk/office-stress-management.html|title=Workplace Stress Management Resource - OFAI|author=|date=|website=www.ofai.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327200411/http://www.ofai.co.uk/office-stress-management.html|archivedate=2016-03-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[therapy]], communication programs, and a more flexible work schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/nyheter/news-2013/article.2013-05-22.9197628529|title=Avoiding change-induced stress in the workplace  — Nordic Labour Journal|first=|last=lars|date=|website=www.nordiclabourjournal.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824145833/http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/nyheter/news-2013/article.2013-05-22.9197628529|archivedate=2013-08-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical environment===

A study was done on the stress levels in general practitioners and hospital consultants in 1999. Over 500 medical employees participated in this study done by R.P Caplan. These results showed that 47% of the workers scored high on their questionnaire for high levels of stress. 27% of the general practitioners even scored to be very depressed. These numbers came to a surprise to Dr. Caplan and it showed how alarming the large number of medical workers become stressed out because of their jobs. Managers stress levels were not as high as the actual practitioners themselves. An eye opening statistic showed that nearly 54% of workers suffered from anxiety while being in the hospital. Although this was a small sample size for hospitals around the world, Caplan feels this trend is probably fairly accurate across the majority of hospitals.&lt;ref name=caplan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caplan|first=R.P|title=Stress, Anxiety, and Depression in Hospital Consultants, General Practitioners, and Senior Health Managers|journal=BMJ|date=November 1994|volume=309|pages=1261–1269|doi=10.1136/bmj.309.6964.1261|issue=6964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress management programs===
Many businesses today have begun to use stress management programs for employees who are having trouble adapting to stress at the workplace or at home. Some companies provide special equipments adapting to stress at the workplace to their employees, like coloring diaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloringnotebook.com|title=Anti stress diary with adult coloring pages|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515213919/https://coloringnotebook.com/|archivedate=2017-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stress relieving gadgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/fight-stress-gadgets/|title=20 Gadgets to Help You Fight Stress - Hongkiat Magazine|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217062941/http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/fight-stress-gadgets/|archivedate=2017-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people have spill over stress from home into their working environment. There are a couple of ways businesses today try to alleviate stress on their employees. One way is individual intervention. This starts off by monitoring the stressors in the individual. After monitoring what causes the stress, next is attacking that stressor and trying to figure out ways to alleviate them in any way. Developing social support is vital in individual intervention, being with others to help you cope has proven to be a very effective way to avoid stress. Avoiding the stressors altogether is the best possible way to get rid of stress but that is very difficult to do in the workplace. Changing behavioral patterns, may in turn, help reduce some of the stress that is put on at work as well.

[[Employee assistance programs]] can include in-house counseling programs on managing stress. Evaluative research has been conducted on EAPs that teach individual stress control and inoculation techniques such as relaxation, biofeedback, and cognitive restructuring. Studies show that these programs can reduce the level of physiological arousal associated with high stress. Participants who master behavioral and cognitive stress-relief techniques report less tension, fewer sleep disturbances, and an improved ability to cope with workplace stressors.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz&amp;Schultz|first=D|title=Psychology and work today|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|page=374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of reducing stress at work is by simply changing the workload for an employee. Some may be too overwhelmed that they have so much work to get done, or some also may have such little work that they are not sure what to do with themselves at work. Improving communications between employees also sounds like a simple approach, but it is very effective for helping reduce stress. Sometimes making the employee feel like they are a bigger part of the company, such as giving them a voice in bigger situations shows that you trust them and value their opinion. Having all the employees mesh well together is a very underlying factor which can take away much of workplace stress. If employees fit well together and feed off of each other, the chances of lots of stress is very minimal. Lastly, changing the physical qualities of the workplace may reduce stress. Changing things such as the lighting, air temperature, odor, and up to date technology.

Intervention is broken down into three steps: primary, secondary, tertiary. Primary deals with eliminating the stressors altogether. Secondary deals with detecting stress and figuring out ways to cope with it and improving stress management skills. Finally, tertiary deals with recovery and rehabbing the stress altogether. These three steps are usually the most effective way to deal with stress not just in the workplace, but overall.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=Sally|title=Occupational Stress: Personal &amp; Professional Approaches|year=1998|publisher=Stanley Thornes ltd.|location=United Kingdom|pages=18–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation industry===
Aviation is a [[Stress in the aviation industry|high-stress industry]], given that it requires a high level of precision at all times.  Chronically high stress levels can ultimately decrease performance and compromise safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woldring|first1=Michael|date=1996-03-15|title=Human Factors Module: Stress|journal=European organisation for the safety of air navigation|url=https://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/field_tabs/content/documents/nm/safety/safety-human-factors-module-stress-1996.pdf|volume=1|pages=3–16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222131033/https://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/field_tabs/content/documents/nm/safety/safety-human-factors-module-stress-1996.pdf|archivedate=2015-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To be effective, stress measurement tools must be specific to the aviation industry, given its unique working environment and other [[stressor]]s.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Stress measurement in aviation seeks to quantify the [[psychological stress]] experienced by [[aviator]]s, with the goal of making needed improvements to aviators' [[coping skills|coping]] and stress management skills.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lehrer |first1=P |last2=Karavidas |first2=M |last3=Lu |first3=SE |last4=Vaschillo |first4=E |last5=Vaschillo |first5=B |last6=Cheng |first6=A |date=May 2010 |title=Cardiac data increase association between self-report and both expert ratings of task load and task performance in flight simulator tasks: An exploratory study |journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=80–7 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2010.02.006 |pmid=20172000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To more precisely measure stress, aviators' many responsibilities are broken down into "workloads."  This helps to categorise the broad concept of "stress" by specific stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biondi|first1=M|last2=Picardi|first2=A|date=1999|title=Psychological stress and neuroendocrine function in humans: The last two decades of research|journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics|volume=68|issue=3|pages=114–50|doi=10.1159/000012323|pmid=10224513}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, since different workloads may pose unique stressors, this method may be more effective than measuring stress levels as a whole.  Stress measurement tools can then help aviators identify which stressors are most problematic for them, and help them improve on managing workloads, planning tasks, and coping with stress more effectively.

To evaluate workload, a number of tools can be used.  The major types of measurement tools are:
# Performance-based measures;
# [[Subjectivity|Subjective]] measures, like questionnaires which aviators answer themselves; and
# [[Physiological]] measures, like measurement of heart rate.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Implementation of evaluation tools requires time, instruments for measurement, and software for collecting data.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

====Measurement systems====
The most commonly used stress measurement systems are primarily [[rating scale]]-based.  These systems tend to be complex, containing multiple levels with a variety of sections, to attempt to capture the many stressors present in the aviation industry.  Different systems may be utilised in different operational specialties.

* The [[Perceived Stress Scale]] (PSS) – The PSS is a widely used subjective tool for measuring stress levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Langan-Fox |first=J |last2=Sankey |first2=M |last3=Canty |first3=JM |date=October 2009 |title=Human factors measurement for future air traffic control systems |journal=Human Factors |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=595–637 |doi=10.1177/0018720809355278 |pmid=20196289}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of 10 questions, and asks participants to rate, on a five-point scale, how stressed they felt after a certain event.  All 10 questions are summed to obtain a total score from 0 to 40.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  In the aviation industry, for example, it has been used with flight training students to measure how stressed they felt after flight training exercises.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirschner|first1=J|last2=Young|first2=J|last3=Fanjoy|first3=R|date=2014|title=Stress and coping as a function of experience level in collegiate flight students|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/jate/vol3/iss2/3/|journal=Journal of Aviation Technology and Engineering|volume=3|issue=2|pages=14–19|doi=10.7771/2159-6670.1092|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528192713/http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/jate/vol3/iss2/3/|archivedate=2016-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Coping Skills Inventory – This inventory measures aviators' skills for coping with stress.  This is another subjective measure, asking participants to rate, on a five-point scale, the extent to which they use eight common coping skills:&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; [[Substance abuse]], Emotional support, Instrumental support (help with tangible things, like child care, finances, or task sharing), Positive reframing (changing one's thinking about a negative event, and thinking of it as a positive instead), Self-blame, Planning, Humour and Religion. An individual's total score indicates the extent to which he or she is using effective, positive coping skills (like humor and emotional support); ineffective, negative coping skills (like substance abuse and self-blame); and where the individual could improve.
* The Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) – SWAT is a rating system used to measure individuals' perceived mental workload while performing a task, like developing instruments in a lab, multitasking aircraft duties, or conducting air defense.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Corwin |first=W.H. |date=1992-04-01 |title=In-flight and post flight assessment of pilot workload in commercial transport aircraft using the subjective workload assessment technique |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327108ijap0202_1?journalCode=hiap20 |journal=The International Journal of Aviation Psychology |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=77–93 |doi=10.1207/s15327108ijap0202_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SWAT combines measurements and scaling techniques to develop a global rating scale.

====Pilot stress report systems====
Early pilot stress report systems were adapted and modified from existing psychological questionnaires and surveys.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite report |author=Young, James |date=December 2008 |title=The Effects of Life-Stress on Pilot Performance |url=http://humansystems.arc.nasa.gov/flightcognition/Publications/Young_TM2008_215375_final.pdf |publisher=NASA Ames Research Center |pages=1–7 |docket= |accessdate= |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305152852/http://humansystems.arc.nasa.gov/flightcognition/Publications/Young_TM2008_215375_final.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The data from these pilot-specific surveys is then processed and analyzed through an aviation-focused system or scale.  Pilot-oriented questionnaires are generally designed to study work stress or home stress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Self-report can also be used to measure a combination of home stress, work stress, and perceived performance. A study conducted by Fiedler, Della Rocco, Schroeder and Nguyen (2000) used Sloan and Cooper's modification of the Alkov questionnaire to explore aviators' perceptions of the relationship between different types of stress.  The results indicated that pilots believed performance was impaired when home stress carried over to the work environment. The degree of home stress that carried over to work environment was significantly and negatively related to flying performance items, such as planning, control, and accuracy of landings. The questionnaire was able to reflect pilots' retroactive perceptions and the accuracy of these perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Muller, Ronald |editor2=Andreas Wittmer |editor3=Christopher Drax |date=2014 |title=Aviation Risk and Safety Management: Methods and Applications In Aviation Organizations |url= |location= |publisher=Springer International |page= |isbn=978-3-319-02779-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alkov, Borowsky, and Gaynor started a 22-item questionnaire for [[U.S. Naval]] aviators in 1982 to test the [[hypothesis]] that inadequate stress coping strategies contributed to flight mishaps.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The questionnaire consists of items related to lifestyle changes and personality characteristics. After completing the questionnaire, the test group is divided into two groups: "at-fault" with mishap, and "not-at-fault" in a mishap. Then, questionnaires from these two groups were analyzed to examine differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=O'Connor, Paul E. |editor2=Cohn, Joseph V. |date=2010 |title=Human Performance Enhancement in High-Risk Environments: Insights, Developments, and Future Directions from Military Research |url= |location= |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page= |isbn=978-0-313-35983-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of British commercial airline pilots, conducted by Sloan and Cooper (1986), surveyed 1,000 pilot members from the [[British Airline Pilots' Association]] (BALPA).  They used a modified version of Alkov, Borowsky, and Gaynor's questionnaire to collect data on pilots'  perceptions of the relationship between stress and performance.  Being a subjective measure, this study's data was based on pilots' perceptions, and thus rely on how accurately they recall past experiences their relationships to stress.  Despite relying on subjective perceptions and memories, the study showed that pilot reports are noteworthy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Beck Depression Inventory]] (BDI) is another scale used in many industries, including the mental health professions, to screen for [[depression (mood)|depressive]] symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barralabc |first=C |last2=Rodríguez-Cintasb |first2=L |last3=Martínez-Lunaabc |first3=Nieves |last4=Bachillerabc |first4=D |date=2014-11-13 |title=Reliability of the Beck Depression Inventory in opiate-dependent patients |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/14659891.2014.980859 |journal=Journal of Substance Abuse |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages=1–6 |doi=10.3109/14659891.2014.980859|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Parsa and Kapadia (1997) used the BDI to survey a group of 57 [[U.S. Air Force]] [[fighter pilot]]s who had flown combat operations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  The adaptation of the BDI to the aviation field was problematic.  However, the study revealed some unexpected findings.  The results indicated that 89% of the pilots reported insomnia; 86% reported irritability; 63%, dissatisfaction; 38%, guilt; and 35%, loss of [[libido]].  50% of two [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s and 33% of another squadron scored above 9 on the BDI, suggesting at least low levels of depression.  Such measurement may be difficult to interpret accurately.{{why?|date=December 2015}}

'''Sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification''' are programs aimed at increasing consumer awareness of the environmental impact and sustainability of their seafood purchasing choices. 

California-based [[Seafood Watch]] and [[Marine Conservation Society]]'s ''fish online'' are some of the best-known guides. One of the best-known certification programs is [[Marine Stewardship Council]]'s scheme for consumer seafood products.

Other programs include regional guides, such as that produced by the [[Australian Marine Conservation Society]] (AMCS). In Canada, [[SeaChoice]] produces assessments and recommendations using the traffic light system, while recommendation of restaurants is done by [[Vancouver Aquarium]]'s [[Ocean Wise]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12679">[[Image:Veterinary Surgeon.jpg|thumb|right|A veterinary surgeon removes stitches from a cat's face following minor surgery on an abscess.]]
'''Veterinary medicine in the United Kingdom''' is the performance of [[veterinary medicine]] by licensed professionals, and strictly regulated by statute law, notably the [[Veterinary Surgeons Act]] of 1966.  Veterinary medicine is led by [[veterinary physician]]s, termed 'veterinary surgeons' (with a different meaning to how it is used in some other [[anglophone countries]], where it denotes a surgical specialist), normally referred to as 'vets'.

Vets are often assisted by registered veterinary nurses, who are able to both assist the vet and to autonomously practice a range of skills of their own, including minor surgery under direction from a responsible vet.

Other professionals are also permitted to perform some animal treatment, through exemptions in the law, and these include [[Joint manipulation|manipulation]] techniques such as [[physiotherapy]], [[chiropractic]] and [[osteopathy]].  Other alternative medicine therapies, such as [[homeopathy]], [[acupuncture]], [[phytotherapy]] and [[aromatherapy]] may only be performed by a licensed veterinary surgeon.

The practice of veterinary medicine in the United Kingdom is regulated by the [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]] (RCVS), who licence both veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses.

==Veterinary surgeons==
In order to practice veterinary medicine in the UK, a veterinary surgeon must hold a current registration with the RCVS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the veterinary profession|url=http://www.rcvs.org.uk/about-us/about-the-veterinary-profession/|website=RCVS|accessdate=2017-03-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires a qualifying degree, usually in [[veterinary science]] or veterinary medicine. From March 2015, veterinary surgeons registered with the RCVS in the UK may optionally use the courtesy title ''Dr''.&lt;ref name="h1334"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vets can call themselves Dr - RCVS|journal=Veterinary Record|date=16 March 2015|volume=176|issue=11|page=267|doi=10.1136/vr.h1334}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it the third clinical degree in the UK, after medicine and dentistry, to allow the use of the title Dr.  The origins of veterinary surgeons parallel to human surgery are reflected in human medicine where qualified surgeons also drop their Dr designation and revert to their original title.

===Education===
Veterinary medicine degree courses are usually five years in length, although [[Cambridge University]]'s degree takes six, and in some cases, a four-year accelerated course is available.  There are a limited number of places on veterinary courses each year, with only eight British Universities offering the degree ([[University of Bristol|Bristol]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool]], [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham]], the [[Royal Veterinary College]], London, and [[University of Surrey|Surrey]]).

[[Continuing professional development]] (CPD) is a mandatory and key part of career development. The RCVS recommends a minimum of 105 hours CPD over a three-year period. The RCVS [[Professional Development Phase]] (PDP) that was launched for new graduates in 2007 provides a structured approach to guide the new graduate towards the professional competences they need to develop in either small animal, equine or production animal practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons|title=Professional Development Phase|url=http://www.rcvs.org.uk/pdp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specialism===
Vets may choose to specialise in various areas of veterinary medicine, through certificate qualifications, modular certificates or diplomas, with each speciality taking around two years to complete. Certificates cover a wide range of areas, including small animal medicine, small animal surgery, large animal medicine, welfare ethics and law, public health, [[cardiology]], [[orthopaedics]] and advanced veterinary practice ([[Cert AVP]]).

There is a large and potentially confusing array of post-nominal titles in the UK veterinary profession.&lt;ref name="VRg2989"&gt;{{cite journal|title=RCVS Council asked to review its decision on postnominals|journal=Veterinary Record|date=2 May 2014|volume=174|issue=18|page=437|doi=10.1136/vr.g2989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Levels of credibility vary. In particular, Certificate level qualification does not qualify a veterinary surgeon as a specialist.  With further training, extensive professional experience and by publishing articles in a particular subject area, it is possible to gain [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]] (RCVS) [[Recognised Specialist Status]]. In 2012, the ruling council of the RCVS adopted a report from the Calman Committee into specialisation in the UK veterinary profession, accepting that only those veterinary surgeons recognised by the RCVS as specialists and placed on a register held by the RCVS could be truly held up as "Specialist". Members of the public looking for an appropriately accredited specialist veterinary surgeon in the UK should therefore primarily seek those that carry the post-nominal description of "RCVS Recognised Specialist in..." after their name.  No other accolade carries authority from the appropriate regulatory body.

Vets may undertake the training to become an Official Veterinarian (OV) which authorises them to carry out tasks on behalf of the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], such as testing cattle for [[tuberculosis]] or issuing of documentation for the export of animals and animal products.

===Employment===
Most veterinary surgeons work in private practice, either in a general practice, or specialising in one type of animal (small animal, equine, zoo animal etc.). Newly qualified veterinary surgeons usually work as assistants for some time before being offered the opportunity to become a partner or a principal. Becoming a partner involves increased responsibility, the need for more business and management skills and a financial input into the practice.

Some vets are also employed by animal welfare charities who offer treatment to the public, such as [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (RSPCA), the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]] (PDSA) and [[The Blue Cross]].

There are also opportunities to work for government services, including APHA (the Animal and Plant Health Agency) who are responsible for the control and eradication of major notifiable diseases, animal welfare, promotion of international trade and certain public health functions related to residues in meat and investigation of food safety incidents, and scanning surveillance, or the [[Veterinary Medicines Directorate]] (VMD) who licence veterinary medicines.

It is also possible to pursue a research and/or teaching career within universities or research bodies.

==Veterinary nurses==
Veterinary Nurses are the primary [[paraveterinary workers]] in the United Kingdom and work alongside vets.  Veterinary Nurses must be registered and follow a strict code of conduct.  Veterinary Nurses have a scope of autonomous practice within which they can act for the animals they treat. Under schedule 3 of the Veterinary Surgeons act they can perform many complex procedures include minor surgery, admission of intravenous fluid therapy and parenteral nutrition, performing diagnostic imaging and monitoring anaesthesia.

Preventative medicine is also an important part of the veterinary nurse’s role with nurse clinics and consultations becoming increasingly common. Nurse led clinics may cover such areas as nutrition and weight management, management of the diabetic or senior patient, parasite control, vaccinations, puppy and kitten socialisation, dental care and wound care.

===Registration===
All veterinary nurses must be registered with the [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]] (RCVS).  Registered Veterinary Nurses have dispensations in law [the Veterinary Surgeons Act of 1966 amended in 2002)] to undertake certain procedures to include minor surgery and anaesthesia on animals under veterinary direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Pullen|first1=Sophie|first2=Carol|last2=Gray|title=Ethics, Law and the Veterinary Nurse|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|publisher=Elsevier Limited|year=2006|page=161|isbn=0-7506-8844-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registered Veterinary Nurses (RVNs) are bound by a code of professional conduct and are obliged to maintain their professional knowledge and skills through ongoing CPD.  Those VN's listed after 2002 are automatically registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veterinary qualifications:  Registered veterinary nurse:  RVN|publisher=[[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]]|url=http://findavet.rcvs.org.uk/find-a-vet/veterinary-qualifications/|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transferring to the VN Register|publisher=[[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]]|url=http://www.rcvs.org.uk/registration/how-to-register/transferring-to-the-vn-register/|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
RVNs train for the Register through either a two to three year further education diploma programme or via a qualifying foundation or honours degree which can be three to four years.  All student nurses must complete a minimum of 2100 hours of work experience in general veterinary practice during their training.

RCVS badges are engraved with the nurse's personal badge number, and as of 2012 are available with the additional engraving ‘registered’ for RVNs.

VN's can further their formal training and gain additional postnominal letters by completing one of many specialist certificates and/or by achieving the RCVS Diploma in Advanced Veterinary Nursing (DipAVN) by following a course of study in one or more of three pathways:  Small animal nursing, Equine nursing, and Veterinary nursing education.  The streamlined RCVS DipAVN replaced the DipAVN(Medical) and DipAVN(Surgical) formerly administered by the BVNA up until 2005.  The DipAVN is offered through [[Myerscough College]] in Lancashire since 2007 and more recently through [[Harper Adams University]], some modules are also available from the [[Royal Veterinary College]] in conjunction with the [[University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DipAVN(Surgical/Medical)|publisher=[[British Veterinary Nursing Association, Ltd.]]|url=http://www.bvna.org.uk/smartweb/further-education/dipavn-medical|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diploma in Advanced Veterinary Nursing|publisher=[[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]]|url=http://www.rcvs.org.uk/education/diploma-in-advanced-veterinary-nursing/|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Representation===
UK Veterinary Nurses are represented by the [[British Veterinary Nursing Association]] (BVNA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Careers|publisher=[[British Veterinary Nursing Association, Ltd.]]|url=http://www.bvna.org.uk/smartweb/careers/careers|accessdate=27 Feb 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Prior to 1979, the term "nurse" was reserved for members of the [[General Nursing Council]], but it was not until 1984 that the term "veterinary nurse" was permitted to be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warner|first1=JD|title=Assessing veterinary nurses in practice|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier Butterworth Heinemann|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780750688406|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal nursing assistants==
Lay staff, without formal qualification or status may be called animal nursing assistants (the BVNA approved term) or veterinary care assistants.   These lay staff have usually undertaken some basic veterinary nurse training but are limited by law as to the procedures they may undertake on animals.  They work alongside qualified vets and veterinary nurses to provide care and support to animal patients and their owners.

'''Waruga''' are a type of [[sarcophagus]] or above ground [[tomb]] traditionally used by the [[Minahasa]]ns of [[North Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]. They are made of stone and consist or a ridged upper part and a box shaped lower section.

Dead Minahasans were originally wrapped in woka, a type of leaf. Woka is the leaf of the fan palm, Livistona. Then they were put in wooden coffins.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In the 9th century the Minahasa started using waruga.

Bodies are put in a position facing north. They seated with heel and toe attaches to the buttocks and the head "kissing" the knees. The Minhasa believe their ancestors came from the north.

In 1828 the Dutch banned the use of waruga&lt;ref name=indo&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WKoIooGXjPYC&amp;pg=PA962&amp;lpg=PA962&amp;dq=Waruga+sarcophagus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uvEGJrG_rg&amp;sig=WFinmy8qUpeos4oRln9NyeUQte0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCmoVChMIuffQyI2fxwIVzCUeCh2rQA2z#v=onepage&amp;q=Waruga%20sarcophagus&amp;f=false Indonesia] by Stephen Backshall page 962&lt;/ref&gt; and the Minahasa started making coffins. Disease outbreak, including typhoid and cholera, was feared. And Christian practice is to bury the dead.

Waruga in Tonsea have carvings and reliefs showing how the bodies are stored in their respective waruga and illustrating livelihoods.

There are about 370 Warugas (waruga-waruga) in [[Rap-Rap]] (15), [[Airmadidi Down]] (211) and  [[Sawangan, North Sulawesi]] (144). They are a tourist attraction and were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1995 in the [[waruga archaeological park]] in Sawangan. At Taman Purbakala Waruga-Waruga, the sarcophagi have been collected from surrounding areas and at a nearby museum porcelain, armbands, axes and bone fragments are exhibited.&lt;ref name=indo/&gt; Most of the waruga have been looted for valuable contents.

'''Water fasting''' is a type of [[fasting]] in which the practitioner consumes only water. One may water fast for a variety of reasons, including medical and religious requirements.

==Religious requirement==

===Jainism===
{{main|Fasting in Jainism}}
[[Jainism|Jains]] maintain a strict water-only fast for 8 to 10 (digambar &amp; Swetambar) days, during the days of [[Paryushan]].

===Roman Catholicism===
{{main|Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church}}
[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] must engage in the [[eucharistic fast]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P39.HTM#AN] Canon 919 §1 of the [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Code of Canon Law]] of the [[Catholic Church]]&lt;/ref&gt; before receiving the [[Eucharist]] during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. While no nutritional or caloric sustenance is permitted, practitioners may take medicine if required, and those whose health problems impede them from fasting are dispensed of the obligation.

Up until the reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]], this fast was required from the previous midnight, as it is in various Orthodox Churches.  However, under Pope [[Paul VI]], the obligatory fast was reduced to only one hour before receiving the [[Eucharist]].

The Catholic Church has also promoted a [[Black Fast]], in which in addition to water, bread is consumed.  Typically, this form of fasting was only used by [[monk]]s and other religious individuals who practice mortifications and asceticism, but all Catholics are invited to take part in it with the advice and consent of their [[spiritual director]].
