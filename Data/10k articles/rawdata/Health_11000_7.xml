The '''acute chest syndrome''' is a [[vaso-occlusive crisis]] of the [[pulmonary]] [[vasculature]] commonly seen in people with [[sickle cell anemia]]. This condition commonly manifests with a new [[Infiltration (medical)|opacification]] of the lung(s) on a chest [[x-ray]].&lt;ref name="Pace2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Betty Pace|title=Renaissance of Sickle Cell Disease Research in the Genome Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhqswaCtcLQC&amp;pg=PA81|accessdate=15 June 2010|year=2007|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=978-1-86094-645-5|pages=81–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The crisis is a common complication in sickle-cell patients and can be associated with one or more symptoms including fever, cough, excruciating pain, [[sputum]] production, [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], or [[Hypoxia (medical)|low oxygen levels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Johnson, CS|year=1995|title=Sickle-Cell Disease: The Acute Chest Syndrome|url=http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/acutechest.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Acute chest syndrome is often precipitated by a lung infection, and the resulting [[inflammation]] and loss of oxygen saturation leads to further sickling of red cells, thus exacerbating pulmonary and systemic hypoxemia, sickling, and vaso-occlusion.
==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of acute chest syndrome is made difficult by its similarity in presentation with pneumonia.  Both may present with a new opacification of the lung on chest x-ray.  The presence of fevers, low oxygen levels in the blood, increased respiratory rate, chest pain, and cough are also common in acute chest syndrome.  Diagnostic workup includes chest x-ray, complete cell count, reticulocyte count, ECG, and blood and sputum cultures.  Patients may also require additional blood tests or imaging (e.g. a CT scan) to exclude a heart attack or other pulmonary pathology.  
==Prevention==
[[Hydroxycarbamide|Hydroxyurea]] is a medication that can help to prevent acute chest syndrome. It may cause a [[Leukopenia|low white blood cell count]], which can predispose the person to some types of infection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/treatments.html Sickle cell disease (SCD)]. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. Retrieved January 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Broad spectrum antibiotics to cover common infections such as ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' and [[mycoplasma]], pain control, and [[blood transfusion]]. Acute chest syndrome is an indication for [[exchange transfusion]].

[[Bronchodilators]] may be useful but have not been well studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knight-Madden|first1=JM|last2=Hambleton|first2=IR|title=Inhaled bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Aug 2, 2014|volume=8|pages=CD003733|pmid=25086371|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003733.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
It may result in death,&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/20711638|acute chest syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is one of the most common causes of death for people with sickle cell anemia.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Abbas, Fausto. Robbins and Cotran: The Pathologic Basis of Disease, Page 631&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ash pit''' is a remnant of a [[wildfire]]. It is a hole in the ground filled with ash, possibly containing hot embers beneath. It is one of the many hazards faced by those fighting wildfires. It is also a danger to residents and their pets returning after a wildfire has gone out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gabbert, Bill |url=http://wildfiretoday.com/2018/03/20/three-firefighters-suffer-burns-on-arizona-fire/ |title=Three firefighters suffer burns on Arizona fire |publisher=Wildfire Today |date=March 20, 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nwcg.gov/committee/6mfs/ash-pit-hazards |title=Ash Pit Hazards &amp;#124; NWCG |publisher=Nwcg.gov |date= |accessdate=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ash pit may be imperceptible from the ground above, and can remain hot for days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/badger-creek-fire-likely-human-caused/article_d89ce46a-51a2-5555-8fbc-60c0fe57daeb.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621115902/https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/badger-creek-fire-likely-human-caused/article_d89ce46a-51a2-5555-8fbc-60c0fe57daeb.html |archive-date=2018-06-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those accidentally walking into one may be severely burned or killed. 

After a wildfire has gone out, firefighters may detect ash pits from helicopters using infrared sensors. Then can then dig down into them, and extinguish them to prevent flare ups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McDermott, Vincent |url=http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/fort-mcmurray-wildfire-finally-extinguished-after-15-months |title=Fort McMurray wildfire finally extinguished after 15 months |publisher=Edmonton Journal |date=September 1, 2017 |accessdate=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
After a fire burns underground fuels, it can create a void that becomes filled with ash from the burned fuel. There are several environmental factors that increase the likelihood of an ash pit being formed. It may result from the presence of extensive root systems of trees and shrubs, as well as peat and deep duff covering mineral soil. Holes created by animals, such as coyote and badger dens, can become ash pits. Abandoned rodent holes can become filled with dry, organic debris. Once this debris is burned, an ash pit may be produced. Areas that have been modified by humans may also become hazardous ash pits. Examples include areas modified with heavy equipment, former bulldozer piles, as well as sawmill sites and timber yards.

==Detection==
An ash pit may sometimes be detected by the presence of white ash or swarms of insects hovering about.

Nearly translucent smoke that quickly dissipates may be visible emanating from an ash pit when it is between the observer and the sun.

Due to incomplete burning, an ash pit may also produce a smell of burning creosote or incomplete combustion.

==Mitigation==
Upon detection, marking or flagging ash pits is advised. Landscapes that have the potential to produce ash pits should be avoided.

[[File:Dix-Dorothea-LOC.jpg|thumb|The Bill was advocated by activist [[Dorothea Dix]].]]
The '''Bill for the Benefit of the Indigent Insane''' (also called the '''Land-Grant Bill For Indigent Insane Persons''', formally the bill "Making a grant of public lands to the several States for the benefit of indigent insane persons") was proposed legislation that would have established asylums for the [[indigent]] [[insane]], and also blind, deaf, and dumb, via federal land grants to the states.

[[File:Franklin Pierce - Cropped.jpg|thumb|The bill was vetoed by president [[Franklin Pierce]].]]
The bill was the signature initiative of activist [[Dorothea Dix]], and passed both houses of Congress in 1854. However, it was vetoed on May 3, 1854 by President [[Franklin Pierce]], the first of his [[List of United States presidential vetoes#Franklin Pierce|nine vetoes]]. Pierce argued that the federal government should not commit itself to [[social welfare]], which he believed was properly the responsibility of the states.&lt;ref name="Tiffany 1890"&gt;Tiffany, Francis. (1890). ''The Life of Dorothea Lynde Dix''. Boston: The Riverside Press. pp. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main provision of the bill was to set aside {{convert|12225000|acre|km2|0|abbr=on}} of federal land: {{convert|10000000|acre|km2|0|abbr=on}} for the benefit of the insane, and the remainder to be sold for the benefit of the "blind, deaf, and dumb", with proceeds distributed to the states to build and maintain asylums.

The initial request, on June 23, 1848, had been for five million acres (20,000&amp;nbsp;km²), which was subsequently expanded.

== Context and legacy ==
The bill was part of the first wave of public mental health initiatives in the United States, which saw the establishment of asylums.

The bill is seen as a landmark in social welfare legislation in the United States. Pierce's veto established a precedent for federal non-participation in social welfare that lasted over 70 years, until the emergency legislation and [[New Deal]] of the 1930s [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Manning |first=S. W. |date=March 1962 |title=The Tragedy of the Ten-Million-Acre Bill |journal=Social Service Review |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=44–50 |doi=10.1086/641182 |jstor=30016764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare instead the county institution of the [[poor farm]].

No further federal legislation on mental health occurred for over 90 years until 1946 when the [[National Mental Health Act]] was passed, establishing federal mental health policy.

'''CAMBRA''' is an acronym for '''Caries Management by Risk Assessment'''.  It describes a preventative form of [[dentistry]] in which patients are categorized by their relative risk for developing [[dental caries]], based on risk factors including diet, [[oral hygiene]], [[fluoride]] regiment, and past oral health history.

El Salvador (along with [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]]) is one of the most conservative countries in [[Latin America]] in regard to [[drug policy]].{{sfn|Mendiburo-Seguel|Vargas|Oyanedel|Torres|2017|p=8}} According to a 2016 study published by the ''[[International Journal of Drug Policy]]'', only 17% of Salvadorans reported having used cannabis.{{sfn|Mendiburo-Seguel|Vargas|Oyanedel|Torres|2017|p=8}}

==Decriminalization efforts==

In 2014, over 700 people protested in [[San Salvador]] in favor of decriminalizing the consumption and personal cultivation of [[cannabis]]. The demonstration was organized by the [[Activism|activist]] group La María Guanaca and backed by the Evangelical Protestant Church of El Salvador.&lt;ref name="ElNuevoDiario2014"/&gt; 

However, support for cannabis reform remains very low. A 2014 survey by [[Latin_American_Public_Opinion_Project#The_AmericasBarometer|AmericasBarometer]] found that a mere 8% of Salvadorans supported legalization of the drug.{{sfn|Cruz|Queirolo|Boidi|2016|p=7}} According to the survey, support was highest among people with higher levels of education, and low among people who consider religion to be especially important in their lives.{{sfn|Cruz|Queirolo|Boidi|2016|p=7}}

'''Capital punishment in Mexico''' was officially abolished on 15 March 2005, having not been used in civil cases since 1937, and in military cases since 1961. [[Mexico]] is the world's most populous country to have completely abolished the [[capital punishment|death penalty]].

==History==
[[File:Mexican execution, 1914.jpg|left|thumb|A Mexican execution by firing squad in 1914]]
There is significant history of abolitionism in Mexico, dating back to the 19th century. Following the [[Plan of Ayutla]], the [[1857 Constitution of Mexico|1857 constitution]] was drafted, which specifically outlawed the death penalty for political crimes, and allowed abolition for ordinary crimes in the future.&lt;ref name=Cultural&gt;{{Harvnb|Sarat|Boulanger|pp=69–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Constitution&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.juridicas.unam.mx/infjur/leg/conshist/pdf/1857.pdf|title=Constitución Política de la República Mexicana de 1857|year=1857|accessdate=2 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523013917/http://www.juridicas.unam.mx/infjur/leg/conshist/pdf/1857.pdf|archivedate=23 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico's government at that time was quite unstable, and the express abolition of political crimes could have been linked to concern that the lawmakers themselves could become subject to the punishment if there was an uprising. Personal experiences too may have been a factor, as many Mexicans had experienced political repression.&lt;ref name=Cultural/&gt; There was widespread condemnation of the death penalty in the media, and many Mexican literates were familiar with the work of [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria]]. Following the rule of [[Porfirio Díaz]], the death penalty article was amended in the reform which led to the current [[Constitution of Mexico]].&lt;ref name=Cultural/&gt;

The last non-military execution in Mexico was in 1937, and the last military execution (of a soldier charged with insubordination and murder) was in 1961,&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7866811.stm|title=Death penalty debate grows in Mexico|author=Gibbs, Stephen|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=4 February 2009|accessdate=2 August 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211101642/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7866811.stm|archivedate=11 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the official abolition of the military death penalty in 2005 and of the civil death penalty in 1976 lagged the ''[[de facto]]'' cessations by 68 and 15 years, respectively.&lt;ref name=Bitter&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|Whitt|2007|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico is a majority [[Roman Catholic]] country, with 88%&lt;!-- 74 612 373 / 84 794 454 --&gt; of the population identifying themselves as adherents.&lt;ref name="2000 Census"&gt;{{Citation|title=Religión|work=Censo Nacional de Población y Vivienda 2000|year=2000|publisher=[[INEGI]]|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/2000/definitivos/Nal/tabulados/00re01.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925184950/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/2000/definitivos/Nal/tabulados/00re01.pdf|archivedate=25 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Holy See|The Vatican]] has made numerous statements criticizing capital punishment, and this may be a factor in the debate in Mexico.

During a debate in 2018 during the [[Mexican general election, 2018]] candidate [[Jaime Rodríguez Calderón]] proposed to reinstate the [[death penalty]] for [[drug traffickers]], [[Aircraft hijacking|hijackers]], [[infanticide]]s and [[serial killer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =Ciudadanos quieren pena de muerte para narcos y asesinos, asegura ‘El Bronco’|url= https://www.reporteindigo.com/reporte/ciudadanos-quieren-pena-muerte-narcos-asesinos-asegura-bronco-video/|website=Reporte Indigo|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Mexican Drug War===
[[File:Green ad for death penalty in Mexico.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Ecologist Green Party of Mexico|Green Party]] billboard promoting the restoration of the death penalty&lt;ref name=VoA/&gt;]]
The [[Mexican Drug War]] has fueled rising rates of violent crimes such as [[kidnapping]] and [[murder]], prompting a reemergence of capital punishment into the political discourse. The [[Ecologist Green Party of Mexico]] (PVEM), the fourth biggest political force in the country, waged a campaign to promote restoration of the death penalty, including the use of billboards,&lt;ref name=VoA/&gt; as part of promotion of the party for the 2009 election for seats in Congress. There have been proposals to amend the [[Constitution of Mexico|1917 Constitution]] to allow capital punishment from both the PVEM and the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI),  but both were rejected.&lt;ref name=VoA&gt;{{Citation

Surveys in 2009 suggested that up to 70% of the population supported the restoration of the death penalty, however it is unlikely that the constitution will be changed, as both religious and human rights groups have strongly opposed restoration.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7846249.stm|title=Mexico to rethink death penalty|author=Gibbs, Stephen|accessdate=2 August 2009|date=23 February 2009|publisher=[[BBC News]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219154136/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7846249.stm|archivedate=19 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 poll study found younger Mexicans are more likely to support capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-03-death-penalty-mexico.html|title=Study examines death penalty support in Mexico|author=|date=|website=phys.org|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228172630/https://phys.org/news/2017-03-death-penalty-mexico.html|archivedate=28 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;


'''Constitution: Article 22'''

Cruel and unusual punishment is prohibited. Specifically, penalties of death, mutilation, infamy, marks, physical punishments, torments, excessive fines, confiscation of assets, and others are abolished.

Confiscation of assets does not include the application of said assets to pay for civil responsibilities caused by a crime, or when used to pay taxes or other fines. Nor will it be confiscation when said assets are part of illegal activities, or when they are related to organized crime, or when proof of ownership cannot be established.

==International relations==
In 1981, Mexico [[Ratification|ratified]] the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], a treaty of the [[Organization of American States]], which prohibits the death penalty from being restored if eliminated.&lt;ref name=AmConHR&gt;[http://www.cidh.org/Basicos/English/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm American Convention on Human Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618195529/http://www.cidh.org/Basicos/English/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm |date=18 June 2013 }}, art 4.2 ''ratified'' Mar. 2, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LA&gt;{{Citation

'''Capital punishment in the Republic of Macedonia''' is prohibited by its Constitution.

The 1991 (amended in 2001) Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia at Art. 10 states:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.handsoffcain.info/bancadati/schedastato.php?idstato=17000169 &lt;/ref&gt;

:"The human right to life is irrevocable. The death penalty shall not be imposed on any grounds whatsoever in the Republic of Macedonia."

Macedonia is a member of the [[Council of Europe]]. It has also signed and ratified [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=187&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG Protocol no.13].

'''Cora Sherlock''' is a [[pro-life]] campaigner in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. She is deputy chairperson of the [[Pro Life Campaign]].&lt;ref name="officialwebsiteabout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corasherlock.com/about/|title=About Cora Sherlock}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, she was included in [[BBC]]'s [[100 Women (BBC)|100 Women]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=28 October 2014|accessdate=12 September 2016|title=Cora Sherlock named one of BBC’s 100 Women of 2014|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/cora-sherlock-named-one-of-bbc-s-100-women-of-2014-1.1979717}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
== Early life ==

She studied Law at [[University College Dublin]] in 1993, and during that period she joined the Pro Life Campaign.&lt;ref name=catholicherald /&gt; Sherlock completed a Masters in [[Queen's University Belfast]] and qualified as a solicitor. Sherlock is also a member of Toastmasters.

== Political campaigning ==

She has been an anti-abortion campaigner and activist since the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=catholicherald /&gt; As deputy chairperson of the Pro Life Campaign she has often written articles in national newspapers, or appeared on radio and TV on the abortion debate in Ireland.

===2002 Abortion Referendum===
{{See also|Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2002 (Ireland)}}

Cora Sherlock called for a yes vote on the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2002 (Ireland)]]. The [[Pro Life Campaign#2002 Abortion Referendum|Pro Life Campaign also called for a yes vote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/referendum-on-abortion-1.1050005|first=Cora|last=Sherlock|title=Referendum on Abortion|date=11 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|author=Cora Sherlock|date=11 February 2002|text=By voting Yes we will acknowledge that we owe women a better alternative in their most vulnerable time. We acknowledge the very real difference between an abortion, which sets out to take the life of the baby, and the unintentional death of a baby as a side-effect of medical treatment.

In this way pregnant women will continue to receive the attention that has seen Ireland rank as one of the countries that provides the best medical care for pregnant women. Most importantly, a Yes vote signifies our acceptance of the Government's commitment to find a realistic alternative to abortion, a matter which those who intend to vote No have studiously ignored to date.}}

She voted against the [[Treaty of Nice]] in the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001 (Ireland)|2001 referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Cora|last=Sherlock|title=Nice Treaty Referendum|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=5 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daz Studio''' is a software application developed and offered for free by [[DAZ 3D|Daz 3D]]. Daz Studio is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] scene creation and rendering application used to produce images as well as video. Renders can be done by leveraging either the [[3Delight]] render engine, or the [[Mental Ray|Iray]] render engine, both of which ship for free along with Daz Studio, or with a variety of purchasable add-on render engine plugins for Daz Studio from various vendors and companies.

Daz Studio also supports the import and export of various file formats for 3D objects and animations to allow for the use of other 3D content within Daz Studio, as well as to get content out of Daz Studio for use in other 3D applications.

Daz Studio is available for free, but registration is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqXGkYLPt78C&amp;pg=PT379&amp;dq=%22daz+studio%22&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22daz%20studio%22&amp;f=false|title=Online Communities and Social Computing: Third International Conference, OCSC 2009, Held as Part of HCI International 2009, San Diego, CA, USA, July 19–24, ...

On February 1, 2012, DAZ 3D Inc. announced it would be giving away DAZ Studio Pro for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3dworldmag.com/2012/02/02/800-of-software-for-free-grab-daz-studio-pro-bryce-pro-and-hexagon-for-nothing/|title=$800 of software for free: grab Daz Studio Pro, Bryce Pro and Hexagon for nothing|date=February 2, 2012|publisher=3D World Magazine|accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Daz 3D also began offering [[Hexagon (software)|Hexagon]] and Daz Studio together for free, thus adding 3D modeling capabilities to the Daz Studio offering.

== Genesis Figure Technology ==
One of the main differences between Daz Studio and other software applications such as [[Poser]] is that Daz 3D has also included support for its various generations of the "Genesis" technology which is used as the basis for its human figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gfxspeak.com/2011/06/02/daz-3d-introduces-unimesh-technology-for-3d-human-models/|title=Daz 3D introduces Genesis technology for 3D human models  : GraphicSpeak|website=gfxspeak.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daz 3D has had many versions of its human figures and characters, but in 2011 they launched a significant change in the underlying technology.  Instead of each figure being designed individually, Daz 3D moved to their Genesis platform, in which figures were derived as morphs from the base mesh. Two of the key differences that this technology created were: The ability for characters to be blended into a huge variety of shapes, and since these shapes were all derived from a common base, add-on content like clothing, hair, and additional morphs would not only work on all characters, but could actually change with the characters.

The Genesis platform has gone through several versions since the launch in 2011:

Genesis 2:

One of the shortcomings of the Genesis platform was that although it allowed extremely flexibility in the shape of characters and clothing, it also toned down some of the elements of what made a male or female figure unique.  Genesis 2 changed this by splitting the Genesis base figure into two separate base figures: Genesis 2 Male and Genesis 2 Female.

Genesis 3:

Up until Genesis 3 the Genesis figures had been using TriAx Weight Maps, where many other industry platforms were using Dual Quaternion.  This changed in Genesis 3 to allow Daz 3D figures to be more compatible with other 3D software platforms as well as Game Development platforms.

Genesis 8:

The jump in version naming from Genesis 3 to Genesis 8 was in order to address confusion in naming conventions.  Although Genesis had reached its fourth version, most of the Daz 3D flagship characters were now on their eight versions.  In order to avoid the confusion of Victoria 8 or Michael 8 being Genesis 4 characters, Daz 3D shifted the versioning of Genesis to match with the character versions.

Genesis 8 also includes significant changes in the figure's backward compatibility with previous generation's and their content as well as Joint and muscle bends and flexing and facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digisprawl.com/blog/review/review-daz-3ds-victoria-8/|title=Review: DAZ 3D's Victoria 8|date=2017-06-20|work=DigiSprawl|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and overview ==
DAZ Studio is designed to allow users to manipulate "ready to use" models and figures as well as other supporting 3D content. It is  aimed at users who are interested in posing human and non-human figures for illustrations and animation. It was created as an alternative to [[Poser]], the industry-leading software in use for character manipulation and rendering. Daz 3D began its business model selling 3D models of human beings (and a few non-humans), as well as giving away a few of the more popular base models for free from time to time, and clothing and props for the same, and all of these models were constructed to be used in Poser. Daz eventually created their own character manipulation software, and elected to distribute it for free (originally just the base edition, but eventually even the 'pro' version). Initially Daz Studio handled the same file formats that Poser did, but Daz eventually introduced Daz Studio-specific character and file formats (although they also introduced their DSON file importer to make it possible to import Daz Studio characters into Poser).

[[DAZ 3D]] follows the "[[Razor and blades business model]]" - DAZ Studio is the "razor" free-of-charge core program with the required features for the creation of imagery and animations, while relegating other features to the "blades" add-on 'plug-ins', usually commercial, which the user may add. Initially it was possible to easily create new content in another DAZ program, [[Carrara (Software)|Carrara]]. Beginning in 2017 Daz 3D began offering another of their programs, [[Hexagon (software)|Hexagon]], and distributing that as a package with DAZ Studio.

In October 2017 Daz Studio added dForce capabilities to the free offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.daz3d.com/dforc-info-page|title=Daz Studio 4.10 with dForce Simulated Cloth!|website=www.daz3d.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  dForce is a physics engine that Daz Studio uses for simulating the draping of cloth due to gravity, wind, and collision with other objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thinkdrawart.com/daz-studio-dynamic-cloth-dforce-tutorial-for-beginners|title=Daz Studio Dynamic Cloth (dForce) Tutorial for Beginners|website=thinkdrawart.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name EPODE comes from ‘Ensemble Prévenons l'ObésitéDes Enfants’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borys JM, Le Bodo Y, Jebb SA, Seidell JC, Summerbell C, Richard D, De Henauw S, Moreno LA, Romon M, Visscher TL, Raffin S, Swinburn B, ((EEN Study Group)) |title=EPODE approach for childhood obesity prevention: methods, progress and international development |journal=Obesity Reviews |date=April 2012 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=299–315 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00950.x |pmid=22106871 |pmc=3492853}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Together Let's Prevent Childhood Obesity'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dalton|first=Matthew|title=Reporter|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703808904574525462710954426|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=November 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPODE International Network (EIN), is a [[Nonprofit organization]], and is a contribution to the response to the need and demand from the global community in the fight against '''childhood obesity''' and [[Non-communicable disease]]s (NCDs), through sustainable and large-sale Community Based Programmes (CBPs) for '''childhood obesity prevention'''.

In light of the encouraging experiences and results of the EPODE methodology&lt;ref name="pubmed_2009 Oct12"/&gt;  (Towns in Belgium that implemented the program saw a 22 per cent decrease in overweight children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tanaka|first=Phyllis|title=Registered Dietitian and Senior Advisor, Food and Nutrition|url=http://www.fcpc.ca/news/food-c|newspaper=Food &amp; Consumer Products of Canada|date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), the EPODE International Network, was created in 2011 as a response to the global demand for action concerning the increasing international prevalence of overweight and [[obesity]] and the related non-communicable diseases. The EPODE International Network works to promote and enhance the global movement to prevent childhood obesity by supporting Community Based Programmes (CBPs) for childhood obesity prevention through sustainable and large-sale strategies that mobilise a multi-stakeholder dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epode-international-network.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Organisation of EPODE International Network==

The EPODE International Network is an NGO, a network of community-based and school-based [[childhood obesity]]-prevention programmes as well as healthy active initiatives aimed at preventing childhood [[adiposity]] &amp; overweight in children. This NGO facilitates the  sharing of experiences, best practices and tools at the global level for continuous improvement and strengthening of its members. EIN also endeavours to ensure the sustainability of CBPs, SBPs &amp; HAIs over time, contributing to the global movement to reduce and prevent childhood overweight and obesity.

The network is coordinated by a dedicated unit and is supported by 3 platforms gathering a broad diversity of actors:

* A Scientific Board and Platform, with 18 internationally recognized experts in the fields of [[nutrition]] and physical activity to provide scientific guidance for the implementation and evaluation processes to prevent childhood obesity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epode-international-network.com/scientific-platform/about&lt;/ref&gt;
* A Ministers’ Club, gathering Ministers, State Secretaries, members of Parliament and Mayors to raise awareness on the childhood obesity issue and to advocate for a strong and sustainable political involvement in the development of CBPs, SBPs &amp; HAIs around the world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.epode-international-network.com/minister-club/about&lt;/ref&gt;
* A Public-Private Partnership Platform, linking representatives of the civil society, corporate sector, NGOs and institutions to stimulate multistakeholder, concerted and coordinated partnerships supporting the implementation of CBPs around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epode-international-network.com/public-private-partnerships/about&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the EPODE International Network holds regional and global forums which represent a call for global perspectives, solutions and commitments to solve the obesity and NCDs crisis worldwide.&lt;ref name="epode-international-network.com"&gt;http://www.epode-international-network.com/gof&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives of EPODE International Network: childhood obesity prevention==

EPODE International Network’s overall objective is to build international capacity and capability for multi-partner community-based childhood obesity-prevention programmes (CBPs) in countries by:

# Facilitating best practice sharing between EIN member childhood obesity-prevention programmes
# Providing EIN members visibility at global level
# Gathering leading political representatives to place and maintain childhood obesity prevention at the top of agendas
# Gathering the leading global experts to build greater scientific and field evidence in preventing obesity in children and overweight kids
# Forging links for greater dialogue between all stakeholders from Public, Civic and Private Sectors (civil society, corporate sector, institutions)

The EPODE International Network has more than 30 childhood obesity-prevention programme members in over 20 countries. By 2015 EPODE International Network will involve more than 400,000,000 people worldwide.

==Activities of EPODE International Network==

In order to support its member childhood obesity-prevention programmes, the EIN organises regional and global meetings in order to facilitate best practice sharing and hold capacity building workshops, specific to the needs of its members. The EIN Scientific Advisory Board is also active in providing key support to members of the network in numerous ways and notably providing valuable evaluation support and assisting programme members with the publication of their results.&lt;ref name="epode-international-network.com"/&gt;

Some activities include attempts to curb fast-food outlets near schools.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jan/20/schools.health&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elda Emma Anderson''' (October 5, 1899 – April 17, 1961) was an American physicist and health researcher. During World War II, she worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], where she prepared the first sample of pure [[uranium-235]] at the laboratory. A graduate of the [[University of Wisconsin]], she became professor of physics at [[Milwaukee-Downer College]] in 1929. After the war, she became interested in  [[health physics]]. She worked in the Health Physics Division of the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], and established the [[Certified Health Physicist|professional certification agency]] known as the American Board of Health Physics.

==Early life==
Elda Emma Anderson was born in [[Green Lake, Wisconsin]], on October 5, 1899, to Edwin A. Anderson (born in Wisconsin) and his wife, Lena (née Heller) (born in Germany). Anderson was one of three children. Although she was captivated by numbers at an early age, Anderson actually sought to become a kindergarten teacher. This would shift to an interest in science later, partially due to the influence of her older sister, who was an assistant chemistry instructor. As a whole, although her family had certain lofty expectations for their younger daughter, they all supported her in her academic endeavors.&lt;ref name="Sicherman"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/notable-american-women-the-modern-period-a-biographical-dictionary/oclc/6487187|title=Notable American women: the modern period : a biographical dictionary|last=Sicherman|first=Barbara|last2=Green|first2=Carol Hurd|date=1980-01-01|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=0674627326|location=Cambridge, Mass.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (AB) degree from [[Ripon College (Wisconsin)|Ripon College]] in 1922, then a [[master of arts]] (AM) in physics from the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1924.&lt;ref name="Sicherman, Barbara, and Carol Hurd Green 1980 20" /&gt; From 1924 to 1927, she taught at [[Estherville, Iowa|Estherville]] Junior College in [[Iowa]], where she was the dean of [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[mathematics]].&lt;ref name=Editor&gt;Editor. (19 April 1961). Atom Bomb worker Dies, Dr. Elda Anderson. The Milwaukee Journal. Milwaukee, Wisconsin. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, she became professor of physics at [[Milwaukee-Downer College]], then head of the physics department in 1934.&lt;ref name=yount2008/&gt;

==Career==
In 1941 Anderson completed her [[PhD]] at the [[University of Wisconsin]], writing her thesis on "Low energy levels in the atomic spectra Co VII and Ni VIII".&lt;ref name="thesis"/&gt; Immediately after finishing her PhD, Anderson requested time off from her position at Milwaukee-Downer College, in order to conduct war research related to the Manhattan Project at the Office of Scientific Research and Development at Princeton University. Not long after, Anderson was recruited to continue her work specifically at Los Alamos Laboratory. At her new location, Anderson studied basic fission parameters, including analyzing the time delays associated with the absorption and emission of neutrons.  Such work often entailed working upwards of sixteen hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fofweb.com/History/HistRefMain.asp?iPin=WSM007&amp;SID=2&amp;DatabaseName=Modern+World+History+Online&amp;InputText=%2522Manhattan+Project%2522&amp;SearchStyle=&amp;dTitle=Anderson%252C+Elda+Emma&amp;TabRecordType=Biography&amp;BioCountPass=31&amp;SubCountPass=38&amp;DocCountPass=1&amp;ImgCountPass=2&amp;MapCountPass=0&amp;FedCountPass=&amp;MedCountPass=2&amp;NewsCountPass=0&amp;RecPosition=6&amp;AmericanData=&amp;WomenData=&amp;AFHCData=&amp;IndianData=&amp;WorldData=Set&amp;AncientData=&amp;GovernmentData=|title=History Database Search – Anderson%2C Elda Emma|website=www.fofweb.com|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howes"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qiONCwAAQBAJ|title=After the War: US Women in Physics|last=Howes|first=Ruth H.|last2=Herzenberg|first2=Caroline L.|date=2015-12-01|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers|isbn=9781681741581|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other accomplishments at Los Alamos, Anderson prepared the first sample of pure [[uranium-235]] at the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Howes and Herzenberg" /&gt; While there, she lived in a dormitory, and being older than most of the other residents (she was aged fifty), she was put in charge.&lt;ref name="Howes"/&gt; She often worked at night, wearing jeans and a plaid shirt&amp;nbsp;– not the usual attire for a woman at the time.&lt;ref name="Howes and Herzenberg" /&gt;

Following the war, in 1947, Anderson left Los Alamos and returned to teaching at Milwaukee-Downer College, but her involvement in atomic physics led to an interest in the health effects of radiation. In 1949, she left teaching to begin a career in [[health physics]]. At the Health Physics Division of the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in Tennessee, which was only five years old when she joined, she became the first chief of education and training. She spent her career helping to establish the new training program in health physics, teaching and advising graduate fellows in health physics from 1949.&lt;ref name="Sicherman, Barbara, and Carol Hurd Green 1980 20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, K. Z. (1965). Graduate Programs for the Health Physicist in the United States. Health Physics. 11(9): 895–915.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Anderson moved to [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] to become the first chief of education and training in the Health Physics Division of the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A to Z of Women in Science and Math|last=Yount|first=Lisa|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=7}}{{unreliable source|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson also worked with faculty members at [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to create a [[master's degree]] program in health physics at that institution.

Outside of necessary obligations, Anderson was also known for helping students with problems both academic and personal, lending helpful guidance. In some cases, Anderson was known to have given loans to students, as well share a drink in troubling times.&lt;ref name="Sicherman" /&gt;

Anderson organized the first international course in her field in [[Stockholm]] in 1955; she organized similar courses in [[Belgium]] in 1957 and [[Mumbai]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Elda E. (1959). Assignment report on training course for health physicists. Bombay, India. November–December 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Elda E. (18 June 1960).

Knoxville, TN.&lt;/ref&gt; She supported the establishment of the [[Health Physics Society]] in 1955, serving as secretary pro tem and then charter secretary, and eventually as president of the Society from 1959 to 1960. In 1960, she established the [[Certified Health Physicist|professional certification agency]] known as the American Board of Health Physics.&lt;ref&gt;Moeller, D. W. (1972). History of the American Board of Health Physics. American Journal of Public Health. 62(2): 247–251.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite contracting leukemia in 1956, Anderson remained undeterred in her career and maintained her position for several years until her eventual death in 1961.&lt;ref name="Howes" /&gt;

==Death and legacy==
In 1956, Anderson, who never married and had no children, developed [[leukemia]]. She died nearly five years later in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], of [[breast cancer]] and [[leukemia]], possibly as the result of her work with [[radioactive materials]], on 17 April 1961.&lt;ref name=yount2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=ogilvie2000/&gt; Anderson was buried at Green Lake Cemetery in [[Green Lake, Wisconsin]]. She was survived by her sister, Lucille McConnell and niece, Natalie Tarr Millemann. Dr. Anderson's obituary was well covered in the press and scientific journals.&lt;ref name=Editor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oak Ridger. (18 April 1961). Elda Anderson, Obituary.

'''Eusebio Oehl'''  (December 5, 1827 – April 10, 1903) was an Italian [[histologist]] and [[physiologist]] who was a native of [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]]. 

He studied medicine at the [[University of Pavia]], and following graduation (1850), he continued his education in [[Vienna]] under [[Joseph Hyrtl]] (1810-1894) and [[Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke]] (1819-1892). Afterwards, he returned to [[Pavia]], where he taught classes in [[histology]] at the [[Collegio Ghislieri]] and at the university. In 1864 he attained the chair of physiology at the institute of physiology in Pavia.

At Pavia, he introduced [[microscope|microscopic]] studies in the fields of [[anatomy]] and [[histology]], being credited with developing systematic studies of [[Cell (biology)#Anatomy|cell structure]] via the microscope. He conducted pioneer physiological studies on [[salivation]], and described "Oehl's muscles", defined as strands of muscle fibers in the ''[[chordae tendineae]]'' of the left [[atrioventricular valves|atrioventricular valve]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?Oehl's%20muscles Mondofacto Dictionary] (definition of eponym)&lt;/ref&gt; Among his better known students were [[Camillo Golgi]] (1843-1926), [[Camillo Bozzolo]] (1845-1920), [[Giulio Bizzozero]] (1846-1901) and [[Enrico Sertoli]] (1842-1910).

The '''Federal Service for Alcohol Market Regulation''' or '''Rosalkogolregulirovanie''' (in [[Russian language|Russian]]: Федеральная служба по регулированию алкогольного рынка, Росалкогольрегулирование) is a [[Government of Russia|federal]] [[law enforcement agency]] of [[Russian Government|executive authority]] responsible for drafting and implementing state policy and legal regulation in the production and circulation of ethyl alcohol and alcohol products, as well as functions to control the production and trafficking ethyl alcohol and alcohol-containing products, to oversee and provide services in this area

The Service is under the jurisdiction of the [[Government of Russia|Federal Government of Russia]].

==History==
The Federal Service for Alcohol Market Regulation was established by Presidential Decree from 31 December 2008 No. 1883 "On the formation of the Federal Service for Alcohol Market Regulation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsrar.ru/about/docs/1259821830359 Presidential Decree No. 1883, "On the establishment of the Federal Service for Alcoholic market regulation"], Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

In Section 2 of the Government direction from 24 February 2009 No. 154 "On the Federal Service for Alcohol Market Regulation," found that the Federal Service for Alcohol Market Regulation is the unification of various functions from the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance, the Federal Tax Service and the Federal Service for Tariff in respect of all obligations in the sphere of production and turnover of ethyl alcohol and alcohol-containing products, including obligations arising from the execution of court decisions.

On November 30, 2009 the Federal Service for Alcohol Market Regulation issued an order No. 17 "On the establishment and administration of the minimum price of vodka for retail sale until January 1, 2010" according to which from 1 January 2010, the minimum price of vodka for retail sale was set at a rate of 89 rubles per 0.5 liter of the finished product (€2.52 per liter circa).

'''Fort Bovisand''' is a [[fort]] in [[Devon]], [[England]] near the beach of [[Bovisand]]. It was built on the mainland to defend the entrance of [[Plymouth Sound]], at the narrows opposite the east end of [[Plymouth Breakwater]]. The fort is beside Bovisand [[harbour]].

==History==
[[File:Fort Bovisand - geograph.org.uk - 16451.jpg|thumb|right|Fort Bovisand's [[granite]] [[casemate]]s, originally built for [[RML 9 inch 12 ton gun|9-inch Rifled Muzzle Loading gun]]s.]]
*1816: A stone [[jetty]] and [[Slipway|slip]] were built for boats from sailing [[warship]]s anchored in Plymouth Sound to collect [[fresh water]] from the nearby [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]].
*1845: The first fort at the site, named Staddon Height Battery, was started, and still exists in the upper part of the present fort.&lt;ref name ="pastscape"&gt;{{PastScape|mnumber=437584|mname=|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*1861: As part of the recommendations of the [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]], work started on the main part of the fort. Originally intended to have two stories of [[casemate]]s like [[Picklecombe Fort|Fort Picklecombe]], the design was altered during construction to a single storey of 23 [[granite]] casemates with armoured shields. They were arranged in an arc and initially housed 22 [[RML 9 inch 12 ton gun|9-inch Rifled Muzzle Loader]]s (RMLs) and one [[RML 10 inch 18 ton gun|10-inch RML]] gun, with accommodation for 180 men.
*1869: Construction completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianforts.co.uk/pdf/datasheets/bovisand.pdf |title=Fort Bovisand |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=www.victorianforts.co.uk |publisher=Victorian Forts and Artillery |access-date=2 May 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1880: By then the armament included 14 10-inch and nine 9-inch RML guns. Underground there are large deep tunnels to store artillery ammunition safe from enemy gunfire.
*1898: Six [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder quick-firing guns]] were installed.
*Early 1900s: The original guns were removed.
*1939-1945: [[World War II]]:-
*1942: The remaining four 12-pounders were replaced by two twin [[QF 6 pounder 10 cwt gun|6-pounders]], to combat [[E-boat]]s.&lt;ref name ="pastscape"/&gt;
*1943: A [[Bofors 40mm]] anti-aircraft gun was installed.
*1956: The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] abandoned the fort.
*1970: A lease was granted.
*Early 1970s: The fort was converted into a national [[commercial diving]] school and [[scuba diving]] centre.
*About the mid-1970s to at least the early 1990s: The fort at the top of the headland (above the coastal path) was used as a schools outdoor activity centre. The upper fort's magazine and various other buildings were converted to be used as basic bunk houses, kitchen and dining area.  The cottage was used as a toilet and shower block and a lounge and staff accommodation.
*2000: By then the main [[leaseholder]] — Fort Bovisand Underwater Centre — had [[liquidation|liquidated]], but other diving services continued trading. Months of argument continued about the status of the [[lease]]s and viability of existing businesses based there.
*December 2000: Marine Contractors Ltd. (one of the main businesses based there, and one of the parties negotiating to take over the running of Fort Bovisand) went into receivership. As a result, the owners (the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]) decided it was no longer possible to keep the site functioning, and the remaining diving and other firms trading there ceased operations.
*2003: Discovery Divers was set up.
*Mid-2005: After these businesses failed, the site was bought at auction by PowderCreek Ltd (now known as Fort Bovisand Developments Ltd), and company wholly owned by [[Greg Dyke]], ex-Director General of the [[BBC]], with the aim of saving the site and bringing it back to life.
*Mid 2008: Fort Bovisand was home to Discovery Divers.&lt;ref name="disco"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverydivers.org/ |title=Welcome to Discovery Divers |accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2011: After examining a number of options, the Fort Bovisand Trust was formed (a registered charitable body) to take forward proposals for a heritage attraction and a bid to the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]]. Proposal were for a mixed scheme of the heritage centre, diving business, and some residential units.
*2013: The Fort Bovisand Trust gained award of a development grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to progress plans for a heritage visitor attraction and learning centre.

'''''Gomul''''' ({{Korean|hangul=고물|labels=no}}) refers to a number of powdered coatings, toppings, fillings, or dips in [[Korean cuisine]].

== Uses ==
''Gomul'' is used to improve the appearance and taste of ''[[tteok]]'' (rice cake), including ''[[injeolmi]]'', ''[[Danja (food)|danja]]'', and ''[[gyeongdan]]'', as well as between-layer fillings for ''[[siru-tteok]]'' (steamed rice cake).&lt;ref name="Chun"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://issuu.com/the_korea_foundation/docs/korean_food_guide_800__english_/36|title=Korean Food Guide 800|last=Chun|first=Hui-jung|publisher=[[The Korea Foundation]]|year=2014|isbn=89-89782-10-4|editor-last=Yoon|editor-first=Ho-mi|location=Seoul|pages=36-37|via=[[issuu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shurtleff"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.soyinfocenter.com/books/160|title=History of Roasted Whole Soy Flour (Kinako), Soy Coffee, Coffee Alternatives, Problems with Coffee, and Soy Chocolate (1540-2012)|last=Shurtleff|first=William|last2=Aoyagi|first2=Akiko|publisher=[[Soyinfo Center]]|year=2012|isbn=978-1-928914-52-5|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&amp;MAS_IDX=101013000717114|title=gomul|website=[[Doopedia]]|publisher=[[Doosan Corporation]]|language=ko|script-title=ko:고물|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It helps with even cooking of steamed rice cakes, being the less dense layer (compared to the rice flour layer, which tend to turn stickier as it steams) through which steam passes more easily.&lt;ref name="EKC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0003579|title=gomul|last=신|first=미경|website=[[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]|publisher=[[Academy of Korean Studies]]|language=ko|script-title=ko:고물|access-date=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gomul'' is also used for topping ''[[bingsu]]'' (shaved ice). Sometimes, soybean ''gomul'' is served with grilled ''[[samgyeopsal]]'' (pork belly), with meat dipped in the soybean powder when eaten.

== Varieties and preparation ==
[[Vigna angularis|Red bean]] or [[mung bean]] ''gomul'' is used in winter, while [[soybean]] or [[sesame]] ''gomul,'' which don't spoil as fast, are preferred in summer.&lt;ref name="EKC" /&gt;

Common varieties and their preparation are:&lt;ref name="Doo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EKC" /&gt;
* ''Bam-gomul'' ({{lang|ko|밤고물}}; "chestnut strands/flakes or powder") – [[chestnut]]s are shelled and sliced into thin strands or flakes. Alternatively, they can be cooked, shelled, mashed, and sieved through a coarse strainer into powder.
* ''Daechu-gomul'' ({{lang|ko|대추고물}}; "jujube strands/flakes") – [[jujube]]s are peeled, and the skin part is sliced into thin strands or flakes.
* ''Dongbu-gomul'' ({{lang|ko|동부고물}}; "cowpea powder") – the white ''gomul'' is made with [[cowpea]]s.
** ''Geopipat-gomul'' ({{lang|ko|거피팥고물}}; "hulled red bean powder") – to make the white ''gomul'', [[Vigna angularis|red bean]]s (often the [[black adzuki bean|black cultivar]]) are ground in a [[millstone]], soaked in lukewarm water for five to six hours, husked, and steamed in ''[[siru]]''. When properly cooked, the beans are salted, mashed, sieved, and pan-fried without oil over a low heat.
* ''Kkae-gomul'' ({{lang|ko|깨고물}}; "sesame powder") – [[sesame]] is washed, husked, pan-fried without oil, and used whole or coarsely ground with [[mortar and pestle]].
** ''Heugimja-gomul'' ({{lang|ko|흑임자고물}}; "black sesame powder") – [[black sesame]] is prepared in the same way as for sesame.
* ''Kong-gomul'' ({{lang|ko|콩고물}}; "soybean powder") – the yellow ''gomul'' is made by washing, draining, and roasting [[soybean]]s, then mashing them with ginger, garlic, and salt. It is then sieved to desired fineness: coarse ''kong-gomul'' usually used to coat ''[[injeolmi]]'', and coarse ''kong-gomul'' to fill and top ''[[siru-tteok]]''.
* ''Nokdu-gomul'' ({{lang|ko|녹두고물}}; "mung bean powder") – the pale yellow ''gomul'' is made with [[mung bean]]s in the same way that ''geopipat-gomul'' is made. 
* ''Pat-gomul'' ({{lang|ko|팥고물}}; "red bean powder") – to make the dark red ''gomul'', unhusked [[Vigna angularis|red bean]]s are boiled in three parts water, drained when 80% cooked, and let steam for a long time. When properly cooked without excess moisture, it is salted and mashed.
* ''Seogi-gomul'' ({{lang|ko|석이고물}}; "rock tripe strands/flakes") – [[Umbilicaria esculenta|rock tripe]] is sliced into thin strands or flakes.

'''Gråsjøen''' is a [[lake]]/[[reservoir]] in the municipality of [[Surnadal]] (and a very small part in the northeastern corner of the lake is in [[Rindal]]) in [[Møre og Romsdal]] county, [[Norway]].  The lake is located in the northern part of the [[Trollheimen]] mountain range.  The lake is [[dam]]med and the water is used in the Gråsjø power station.  The water flows out of the lake and into the lake [[Foldsjøen]].  [[Snota|Mount Snota]] lies just south of the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yr.no/place/Norway/M%C3%B8re_og_Romsdal/Surnadal/Gr%C3%A5sj%C3%B8en/|title=Gråsjøen|publisher=[[yr.no]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. '''Guillermo Rawson''' (24 June 1821 - 20 January 1890) was a medical doctor and politician in nineteenth-century [[Argentina]]. As Interior Minister in 1862 he met Captain [[Sir Love Jones-Parry, 1st Baronet|Love Jones-Parry]] and [[Lewis Jones (Patagonia)|Lewis Jones]] who were on their way to Patagonia to investigate whether it was suitable for the creation of a [[Welsh settlement in Argentina|Welsh settlement]] there. Rawson came to an agreement with them, and this resulted in the creation of a colony in the [[Chubut Valley]] in the following years. The city of [[Rawson, Chubut|Rawson]], the capital of the province of [[Chubut Province|Chubut]] was named after him.

==Biography==
[[Image:Buenos Aires - Monumento Guillermo Rawson.jpg|thumb|[[Landmarks in Buenos Aires#Monumento a Guillermo Rawson|Memorial to Guillermo Rawson]] in Buenos Aires.]]

Guillermo Rawson's parents were Dr. [[Aman Rawson]], a doctor who had emigrated from the [[United States]] to Argentina, and Justina Rojo, a daughter of a wealthy family in [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan]], where Guillermo was born. His elder brother was the artist [[Franklin Rawson]].
After a [[Jesuit]] education in San Juan, Rawson graduated from the Medical Faculty of [[University of Buenos Aires]] in 1844. Rawson became interested in politics and democracy. In 1853 he was jailed for opposing [[Nazario Benavidez]], the ''[[caudillo]]'' or ''de facto'' governor of San Juan. The following year he was a member of the [[Paraná Congress]], and from 1862 he was Interior Minister in the government of [[Bartolomé Mitre]].

Apart from politics, Rawson was interested in medicine and hygiene. In 1876 he attended the [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia]] to present his work on public health in Buenos Aires, the most developed body of work on the subject at the time.  In 1879, he was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistr American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rawson spent a year in [[Paris]] in 1881 for medical treatment, before returning to Argentina. He returned to France for further treatment in 1885 and died in Paris in 1890.

The building of the first Medical School in Buenos Aires is named after him (Escuela Dr Guillermo Rawson).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4419">The '''Hole in the Horn Buck''' is officially listed as the second largest non-typical [[white-tailed deer]] of all time by the [[Boone and Crockett Club]].  The buck’s [[antlers]] score 328 2/8 non-typical points.  The name of the buck derives from the mysterious hole in the buck’s right antler.  It was later claimed by eyewitness, George Winters, to be caused from a piece of [[chain-link fence]] that pierced the antler shortly before it died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scarbrough|first1=Byron|title=The Hole in the Horn Buck|url=http://chronicle.northcoastnow.com/2013/02/15/the-hole-in-the-horn-buck-2/|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=The Chronicle-Telegram|date=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Hole in the Horn buck was found dead along a railroad in [[Kent, Ohio]] in 1940.  The buck was discovered by a group of railroad workers who had noticed the dead animal stuck under a nearby chain-link fence of the [[Ravenna Arsenal]].  The group of men freed the massive set of antlers.  A shoulder mount of the buck was made by a local [[taxidermist]] and hung in the nearby Kent Canadian Club.  It hung on the wall of the private hunting club for the next 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hole in the Horn|url=http://community.deergear.com/legends|website=Legendary Whitetails|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world-record class mount was virtually anonymous to the public and had never been officially scored until 1983.  The antlers were scored for the first time on August 27, 1983 by Phil Wright, chairman of the Boone &amp; Crockett Scoring Committee.  The initial score came out to be 342 3/8 non-typical points.  Based upon the initial score, [[North American Whitetail]] Magazine declared the buck as the new [[world-record]] in the December 1983 issue of their magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huffman|first1=Larry|last2=Idol|first2=Dick|title=Legendary Whitetails|date=1996|publisher=Wildlife Images|location=Mequon, WI|isbn=0-9633315-3-1|pages=92–101|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the Hole in the Horn buck was re-measured by a judges’ panel of official Boone &amp; Crockett scorers.  The panel submitted a final score of 328 2/8, which placed it as the number two overall non-typical white-tailed deer, falling just short of the 333 7/8 measurement of the Missouri Monarch buck which was found in 1981 in [[St. Louis County, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hole-In-The-Horn Mystery Record Rack Stirs Debate After All These Years|url=http://newsok.com/hole-in-the-horn-mystery-record-rack-stirs-debate-after-all-these-years/article/2346373/?page=2|accessdate=6 April 2015|work=NewsOK|date=3 February 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hole in the Horn buck is one of the most famous bucks in the world due to its enormous size, mysterious hole in the right antler, and controversial score.  The Hole in the Horn buck was part of the original Legendary Whitetails collection owned by Larry Huffman.  Replica mounts of the Hole in the Horn buck exist in many outdoor [[retail stores]], including [[Cabela’s]] and [[Bass Pro Shops]] and also one hangs in the front office at Legendary Whitetails corporate headquarters.  The original set of antlers was purchased with Larry’s entire collection of Legendary Whitetails by Bass Pro Shops in 2002.  The mount now hangs in the King of Bucks collection in the [[American National Fish and Wildlife Museum]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whittington|first1=Gordon|title=Home of the Giants|url=http://www.northamericanwhitetail.com/naw-tv/television_naw_wonders/|website=North American Whitetail|accessdate=8 April 2015|archivedate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davenport|first1=Les|title=Larry Huffman: Mr. Legendary Whitetail|url=http://www.northamericanwhitetail.com/trophy-bucks/trophybucks_naw_0707_04/|website=North American Whitetail|accessdate=8 April 2015|archivedate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indoor air quality''' ('''IAQ''') is the [[air quality]] within and around [[building]]s and [[structure]]s. IAQ is known to affect the health, comfort and well-being of building occupants. Poor indoor air quality has been linked to [[Sick Building Syndrome]], reduced productivity and impaired learning in schools.

IAQ can be affected by gases (including [[carbon monoxide]], [[radon]], [[volatile organic compound]]s), [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]], [[Microorganism|microbial]] contaminants ([[mold]], [[bacteria]]), or any mass or energy stressor that can induce adverse health conditions.  Source control, filtration and the use of [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] to dilute contaminants are the primary methods for improving indoor air quality in most buildings. Residential units can further improve indoor air quality by routine cleaning of carpets and area rugs.

Determination of IAQ involves the collection of air samples, monitoring human exposure to pollutants, collection of samples on building surfaces, and computer modelling of air flow inside buildings.

IAQ is part of [[Green building#Indoor environmental quality enhancement|indoor environmental quality]] (IEQ), which includes IAQ as well as other physical and psychological aspects of life indoors (e.g., lighting, visual quality, acoustics, and thermal comfort).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=KMC Controls|title=What's Your IQ on IAQ and IEQ |url=http://blog.kmccontrols.com/index.php/2015/09/24/whats-your-iq-on-iaq-ieq/|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516212043/http://blog.kmccontrols.com/index.php/2015/09/24/whats-your-iq-on-iaq-ieq/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 May 2016|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common pollutants==

===Second-hand smoke===
{{main|Second-hand smoke}}
[[Second-hand smoke]] is tobacco smoke which affects people other than the 'active' smoker.  Second-hand tobacco smoke includes both a gaseous and a particulate phase, with particular hazards arising from levels of carbon monoxide (as indicated below) and very small particulates (fine particular matter at especially PM2.5 size, and PM10) which get into the [[bronchiole]]s and [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveole]]s in the lung.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.epi.yale.edu/the-metric/considering-smoking-air-pollution-problem-environmental-health&lt;/ref&gt; The only certain method to improve indoor air quality as regards second-hand smoke is the implementation of comprehensive [[smoking bans|smoke-free laws]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Radon===
{{main|Radon}}
[[Radon]] is an invisible, radioactive atomic gas that results from the radioactive decay of [[radium]], which may be found in rock formations beneath buildings or in certain building materials themselves.  Radon is probably the most pervasive serious hazard for indoor air in the United States and Europe, probably responsible for tens of thousands of deaths from lung cancer each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/radon/index.html |title=U.S. EPA Indoor Environment Division, Radon |publisher=Epa.gov |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are relatively simple test kits for do-it-yourself radon gas testing, but if a home is for sale the testing must be done by a licensed person in some U.S. states. Radon gas enters buildings as a [[soil gas]] and is a heavy gas and thus will tend to accumulate at the lowest level. Radon may also be introduced into a building through drinking water particularly from bathroom showers. Building materials can be a rare source of radon, but little testing is carried out for stone, rock or tile products brought into building sites; radon accumulation is greatest for well insulated homes.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan and Sjaak Slanina. 2010, [http://www.eoearth.org/ ''Air pollution''. Encyclopedia of Earth]. eds. Sidney Draggan and Cutler Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt; The half life for radon is 3.8 days, indicating that once the source is removed, the hazard will be greatly reduced within a few weeks. [[Radon mitigation]] methods include sealing concrete slab floors, basement foundations, water drainage systems, or by increasing ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radon-solution.com/pg_mitigation_methods.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215190050/http://radon-solution.com/pg_mitigation_methods.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-15 |title=Radon Mitigation Methods |accessdate=2008-12-02 |publisher=Radon Solution—Raising Radon Awareness |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually cost effective and can greatly reduce or even eliminate the contamination and the associated health risks.

Radon is measured in picocuries per liter of air (pCi/L), a measurement of radioactivity. In the United States, the average indoor radon level is about 1.3 pCi/L. The average outdoor level is about 0.4 pCi/L. The U.S. Surgeon General and EPA recommend fixing homes with radon levels at or above 4 pCi/L. EPA also recommends that people think about fixing their homes for radon levels between 2 pCi/L and 4 pCi/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Basic radon facts |url=https://www.wvdhhr.org/rtia/pdf/Radon%20Facts.pdf |publisher=US  Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=18 September 2018 |language=en}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molds and other allergens===
{{main|Mold health issues|Mold growth, assessment, and remediation}}

These biological chemicals can arise from a host of means, but there are two common classes: (a) moisture induced growth of mold colonies and (b) natural substances released into the air such as animal dander and plant pollen. Mold is always associated with moisture,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/mold/dampness_facts.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and its growth can be inhibited by keeping humidity levels below 50%. Moisture buildup inside buildings may arise from water penetrating compromised areas of the building envelope or skin, from plumbing leaks, from [[condensation]] due to improper ventilation, or from ground moisture penetrating a building part. Even something as simple as drying clothes indoors on [[radiators]] can increase the risk of exposure to (amongst other things) [[Aspergillus]] - a highly dangerous mould that can be fatal for asthma sufferers and the elderly. In areas where cellulosic materials (paper and wood, including drywall) become moist and fail to dry within 48 hours, mold mildew can propagate and release allergenic spores into the air.

In many cases, if materials have failed to dry out several days after the suspected water event, mold growth is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not immediately visible. Through a mold investigation, which may include destructive inspection, one should be able to determine the presence or absence of mold. In a situation where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been compromised, mold remediation may be needed. Mold testing and inspections should be carried out by an independent investigator to avoid any conflict of interest and to insure accurate results; free mold testing offered by remediation companies is not recommended.

There are some varieties of mold that contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores. The primary hazard of mold growth, as it relates to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than most allergenic properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes in persons that already have [[asthma]], a serious respiratory disease.

===Carbon monoxide===
One of the most acutely toxic indoor air contaminants is [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), a colourless, odourless gas that is a byproduct of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. Common sources of carbon monoxide are tobacco smoke, space heaters using [[fossil fuels]], defective central heating furnaces and automobile exhaust. By depriving the brain of oxygen, high levels of carbon monoxide can lead to nausea, unconsciousness and death. According to the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] (ACGIH), the time-weighted average (TWA) limit for carbon monoxide (630-08-0) is 25 [[Parts per million|ppm]].

Indoor levels of CO are systematically improving due to increasing implementation of [[smoking bans|smoke-free laws]].

===Volatile organic compounds===
[[Volatile organic compound|Volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) are emitted as gases from certain solids or liquids. VOCs include a variety of chemicals, some of which may have short- and long-term adverse health effects. Concentrations of many VOCs are consistently higher indoors (up to ten times higher) than outdoors.  VOCs are emitted by a wide array of products numbering in the thousands. Examples include: paints and lacquers, paint strippers, cleaning supplies, pesticides, building materials and furnishings, office equipment such as copiers and printers, [[correction fluid]]s and [[carbonless copy paper]], graphics and craft materials including glues and adhesives, permanent markers, and photographic solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/iaq/voc.html |title=U.S. EPA IAQ - Organic chemicals |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2010-08-05 |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chlorinated drinking water releases chloroform when hot water is used in the home.  Benzene is emitted from fuel stored in attached garages. Overheated cooking oils emit acrolein and formaldehyde. A meta-analysis of 77 surveys of VOCs in homes in the US found the top ten riskiest indoor air VOCs were acrolein, formaldehyde, benzene,  hexachlorobutadiene, acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, benzyl chloride, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, carbon tetrachloride, acrylonitrile, and vinyl chloride.  These compounds exceeded health standards in most homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2010.00683.x/abstract|title=Hazard assessment of chemical air contaminants measured in residences|first1=J. M.|last1=Logue|first2=T. E.|last2=McKone|first3=M. H.|last3=Sherman|first4=B. C.|last4=Singer|date=1 April 2011|publisher=|volume=21|issue=2|pages=92–109|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2010.00683.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic chemicals are widely used as ingredients in household products. Paints, varnishes, and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning, disinfecting, cosmetic, degreasing, and hobby products. Fuels are made up of organic chemicals. All of these products can release organic compounds during usage, and, to some degree, when they are stored. Testing emissions from building materials used indoors has become increasingly common for floor coverings, paints, and many other important indoor building materials and finishes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130121181543/http://cal-iaq.org/separator/voc/about-vocs California IAQ Information: Volatile Organic Compounds]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several initiatives envisage to reduce indoor air contamination by limiting VOC emissions from products. There are regulations in France and in Germany, and numerous voluntary ecolabels and rating systems containing low VOC emissions criteria such as EMICODE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofins.com/emicode.aspx |title=Emicode |publisher=Eurofins.com |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; M1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofins.com/m1.aspx |title=M1 |publisher=Eurofins.com |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue Angel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofins.com/blue-angel.aspx |title=Blue Angel |publisher=Eurofins.com |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Indoor Air Comfort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indoor-air-comfort.com |title=Indoor Air Comfort |publisher=Indoor Air Comfort |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Europe, as well as California Standard CDPH Section 01350&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofins.com/section-1350.aspx |title=CDPH Section 01350 |publisher=Eurofins.com |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several others in the USA. These initiatives changed the marketplace where an increasing number of low-emitting products has become available during the last decades.

At least 18 Microbial VOCs (MVOCs) have been characterised&lt;ref name=smell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioidea.net/resources/smelly-musty-moldy-houses/|title=Smelly Moldy Houses}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal = J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol |date = November 2004 | volume=31|issue=10|pages=482–8 |title=Rapid identification of microbial VOCs from tobacco molds using closed-loop stripping and gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry | PMID=15517467 |vauthors=Meruva NK, Penn JM, Farthing DE | doi=10.1007/s10295-004-0175-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[1-octen-3-ol]], [[3-methylfuran]], [[2-pentanol]], [[2-hexanone]], [[2-heptanone]], [[3-octanone]], [[3-octanol]], [[2-octen-1-ol]], [[1-octene]], [[2-pentanone]], [[2-nonanone]], [[borneol]], [[geosmin]], [[1-butanol]], [[3-methyl-1-butanol]], [[3-methyl-2-butanol]], and [[thujopsene]].  The first of these compounds is called mushroom alcohol.  The last four are products of ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]'', which has been linked with [[sick building syndrome]].&lt;ref name=smell /&gt;

===''Legionella''===
[[Legionellosis]] or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium ''[[Legionella]]'' that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.

Legionella testing typically involves collecting water samples and surface swabs from evaporative cooling basins, shower heads, faucets/taps, and other locations where warm water collects. The samples are then cultured and colony forming units (cfu) of Legionella are quantified as cfu/Liter.

Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as [[amoeba]], and thus requires conditions suitable for both organisms. The bacterium forms a [[biofilm]] which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine. Remediation for Legionella outbreaks in commercial buildings vary, but often include very hot water flushes (160&amp;nbsp;°F; 70&amp;nbsp;°C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in some cases flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventative measures include adjusting normal hot water levels to allow for 120&amp;nbsp;°F (50&amp;nbsp;°C) at the tap, evaluating facility design layout, removing faucet aerators, and periodic testing in suspect areas.

===Other bacteria===
There are many [[bacteria]] of health significance found in indoor air and on indoor surfaces. The role of microbes in the indoor environment is increasingly studied using modern gene-based analysis of environmental samples. Currently efforts are under way to link microbial ecologists and indoor air scientists to forge new methods for analysis and to better interpret the results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microbe.net/ Microbiology of the Indoor Environment], microbe.net&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bacteria (26 2 27) Airborne microbes.jpg|thumb|Bacteria (26 2 27)
  Airborne microbes]]
"There are approximately ten times as many bacterial cells in the human flora as there are human cells in the body, with large numbers of bacteria on the skin and as gut flora."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sears | first1 = CL | year = 2005 | title = A dynamic partnership: celebrating our gut flora | url = | journal = Anaerobe | volume = 11 | issue = 5| pages = 247–51 | doi = 10.1016/j.anaerobe.2005.05.001 | pmid = 16701579 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A large fraction of the bacteria found in indoor air and dust are shed from humans. Among the most important bacteria known to occur in indoor air are [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]], [[Staphylococcus aureus]], [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]].

===Asbestos fibers===
Many common building materials used before 1975 contain [[asbestos]], such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the building materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimal because the fibers can be spread into the air during the removal process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.

When asbestos-containing material is damaged or disintegrates, microscopic fibers are dispersed into the air. Inhalation of asbestos fibers over long exposure times is associated with increased incidence of [[lung cancer]], in particular the specific form [[mesothelioma]]. The risk of lung cancer from inhaling asbestos fibers is significantly greater to smokers, however there is no confirmed connection to damage caused by asbestosis  . The symptoms of the disease do not usually appear until about 20 to 30 years after the first exposure to asbestos.

[[Asbestos]] is found in older homes and buildings, but occurs most commonly in schools, hospitals and industrial settings. Although all asbestos is hazardous, products that are friable, eg. sprayed coatings and insulation, pose a significantly higher hazard as they are more likely to release fibers to the air. The US Federal Government and some states have set standards for acceptable levels of asbestos fibers in indoor air. There are particularly stringent regulations applicable to schools.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Carbon dioxide===
[[Carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants emitted by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors may cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energyalliancegroup.org/sick-classrooms-require-energy-efficient-solutions-2/|title=Sick Classrooms Caused by Rising CO2 Levels|date=13 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings. Indoor CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.

To eliminate most complaints, the total indoor CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level should be reduced to a difference of less than 600 ppm above outdoor levels.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The [[NIOSH|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]] considers that indoor air concentrations of carbon dioxide that exceed 1,000 [[parts per million|ppm]] are a marker suggesting inadequate ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/BuildingVentilation.html Indoor Environmental Quality: Building Ventilation]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Accessed 2008-10-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The UK standards for schools say that carbon dioxide in all teaching and learning spaces, when measured at seated head height and averaged over the whole day should not exceed 1,500 ppm. The whole day refers to normal school hours (i.e. 9:00am to 3:30pm) and includes unoccupied periods such as lunch breaks. In Hong Kong, the EPD established indoor air quality objectives for office buildings and public places in which a carbon dioxide level below 1,000 ppm is considered to be good.&lt;ref name=HongKongIAQ&gt;{{cite web| url=http://zcada.net/hk-government-initiatives-improve-iaq/| title=Hong Kong Government Initiatives to Improve Indoor Air Quality| publisher=APAC Green Products Limited| archive-date=2016-01-08| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108175015/http://zcada.net/hk-government-initiatives-improve-iaq/}}&lt;/ref&gt; European standards limit carbon dioxide to 3,500 ppm. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] limits carbon dioxide concentration in the workplace to 5,000 ppm for prolonged periods, and 35,000 ppm for 15 minutes. These higher limits are concerned with avoiding loss of consciousness (fainting), and do not address impaired cognitive performance and energy, which begin to occur at lower concentrations of carbon dioxide.

Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.  Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide should be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.

[[File:Edaphic_Scientific_CO2_Levels_for_HVAC_and_IAQ.jpg|thumb|right|alt=CO2 Concentration in an Office.|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in an enclosed office room can increase to over 1,000 ppm within 45 minutes.]]
Carbon dioxide concentrations in closed or confined rooms can increase to 1,000 ppm within 45 minutes of enclosure. For example, in a {{convert|3.5|x|4|m|adj=on}} sized office, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased from 500 ppm to over 1,000 ppm within 45 minutes of ventilation cessation and closure of windows and doors

=== Ozone ===
[[Ozone]] is produced by [[ultraviolet light]] from the Sun hitting the Earth's atmosphere (especially in the [[ozone layer]]), [[lightning]], certain [[High voltage|high-voltage]] electric devices (such as [[air ionizer]]s), and as a by-product of other types of pollution.

Ozone exists in greater concentrations at altitudes commonly flown by passenger jets.  Reactions between ozone and onboard substances, including skin oils and cosmetics, can produce toxic chemicals as by-products.  Ozone itself is also irritating to lung tissue and harmful to human health.  Larger jets have ozone filters to reduce the cabin concentration to safer and more comfortable levels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14594337 Study: Bad In-Flight Air Exacerbated by Passengers]  Talk of the Nation, National Public Radio.  September 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outdoor air used for ventilation may have sufficient ozone to react with common indoor pollutants as well as skin oils and other common indoor air chemicals or surfaces. Particular concern is warranted when using "green" cleaning products based on citrus or terpene extracts, because these chemicals react very quickly with ozone to form toxic and irritating chemicals{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} as well as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|fine]] and [[ultrafine particles]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}  Ventilation with outdoor air containing elevated ozone concentrations may complicate remediation attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/ied/pdf/LBNL-62419.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409155110/http://eetd.lbl.gov/ied/pdf/LBNL-62419.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-09 |title=Outdoor ozone and building related symptoms in the BASE study |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone is on the list of six criteria air pollutant list. The [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] of 1990 required the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to set [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards|National Ambient Air Quality Standard]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (NAAQS) for six common indoor air pollutants harmful to human health. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants#self&lt;/ref&gt; There are also multiple other organizations that have put forth air standards such as [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA), [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). The OSHA standard for Ozone concentration within a space is 0.1 ppm &lt;ref&gt;https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/1994-09-29-0&lt;/ref&gt;. While the NAAQS and the EPA standard for ozone concentration is limited to 0.07 ppm. &lt;ref&gt;https://www3.epa.gov/region1/airquality/avg8hr.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The type of ozone being regulated is ground-level ozone that is within the breathing range of most building occupants

=== Particulates ===
Atmospheric particulate matter, also known as [[particulates]], can be found indoors and can [[Particulates#Health effects|affect the health]] of occupants.  Authorities have established standards for the maximum concentration of particulates to ensure indoor air quality.&lt;ref name=HongKongIAQ /&gt;

==Prompt cognitive deficits==
In 2015, experimental studies reported the detection of significant episodic (situational) cognitive impairment from impurities in the air breathed by test subjects who were not informed about changes in the air quality. Researchers at the Harvard University and SUNY Upstate Medical University and Syracuse University measured the cognitive performance of 24 participants in three different controlled laboratory atmospheres that simulated those found in "conventional" and "green" buildings, as well as green buildings with enhanced ventilation. Performance was evaluated objectively using the widely used Strategic Management Simulation software simulation tool, which is a well-validated assessment test for executive decision-making in an unconstrained situation allowing initiative and improvisation. Significant deficits were observed in the performance scores achieved in increasing concentrations of either [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs) or [[carbon dioxide]], while keeping other factors constant. The highest impurity levels reached are not uncommon in some classroom or office environments.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=New Study Demonstrates Indoor Building Environment Has Significant, Positive Impact on Cognitive Function |publisher=New York Times | date=26 October 2015 | url=http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/stocks/news/press_release.asp?docTag=201510261604PR_NEWS_USPRX____NE38233&amp;feedID=600&amp;press_symbol=278490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EHP&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen | first1=Joseph G. |last2=MacNaughton | first2=Piers |last3=Satish | first3=Usha | last4=Santanam | first4=Suresh | last5=Vallarino | first5=Jose | last6=Spengler | first6=John D. |title=Associations of Cognitive Function Scores with Carbon Dioxide, Ventilation, and Volatile Organic Compound Exposures in Office Workers: A Controlled Exposure Study of Green and Conventional Office Environments |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] | year=2015 |volume= 124|issue= |doi=10.1289/ehp.1510037 |pmid= 26502459|pmc= 4892924|pages= 805–12| url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/15-10037/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect of indoor plants ==
{{main |List of air-filtering plants}}
[[Image:Spider Plant Blades.JPG|thumb|Spider plants ''([[Chlorophytum comosum]])'' absorb some airborne contaminants]]

[[Houseplant]]s together with the medium in which they are grown can reduce components of indoor air pollution, particularly [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOC) such as [[benzene]], [[toluene]], and [[xylene]]. Plants remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and release oxygen and water, although the quantitative impact for house plants is small. Most of the effect is attributed to the growing medium alone, but even this effect has finite limits associated with the type and quantity of medium and the flow of air through the medium.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Hal (1992). "Can House Plants Solve IAQ Problems"&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of house plants on VOC concentrations was investigated in one study, done in a static chamber, by NASA for possible use in space colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Wolverton BC, Johnson A, Bounds K. (1989). [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930073077_1993073077.pdf Interior Landscape Plants for Indoor Pollution Abatement]. NASA.&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed that the removal of the challenge chemicals was roughly equivalent to that provided by the ventilation that occurred in a very energy efficient dwelling with a very low ventilation rate, an air exchange rate of about 1/10 per hour. Therefore, air leakage in most homes, and in non-residential buildings too, will generally remove the chemicals faster than the researchers reported for the plants tested by NASA. The most effective household plants reportedly included [[aloe vera]], [[English ivy]], and [[Boston fern]] for removing chemicals and biological compounds.

Plants also appear to reduce airborne microbes and molds, and to increase humidity.&lt;ref&gt;BC Wolverton, JD Wolverton. (1996). [http://www.wolvertonenvironmental.com/MsAcad-96.pdf Interior plants: their influence on airborne microbes inside energy-efficient buildings]. ''Journal of the Mississippi Academy of Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increased humidity can itself lead to increased levels of mold and even VOCs.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. EPA, Mold and Moisture: Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings
Appendix B - Introduction to Molds [http://www.epa.gov/mold/append_b.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

When carbon dioxide concentrations are elevated indoors relative to outdoor concentrations, it is only an indicator that ventilation is inadequate to remove metabolic products associated with human occupancy. Plants require carbon dioxide to grow and release oxygen when they consume carbon dioxide.  A study published in the journal ''Environmental Science &amp; Technology'' considered uptake rates of [[ketones]] and [[aldehydes]] by the [[peace lily]] (''Spathiphyllum clevelandii'') and [[golden pothos]] (''Epipremnum aureum'') Akira Tani and C. Nicholas Hewitt found "Longer-term fumigation results revealed that the total uptake amounts were 30−100 times as much as the amounts dissolved in the leaf, suggesting that volatile organic carbons are metabolized in the leaf and/or translocated through the petiole."&lt;ref&gt;Akira Tani and C. Nicholas Hewitt "Uptake of Aldehydes and Ketones at Typical Indoor Concentrations by Houseplants" Enivronmental Science &amp; Technology, American Chemical Society, October 6, 2009 [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es9020316]&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting the researchers sealed the plants in Teflon bags. "No VOC loss was detected from the bag when the plants were absent. However, when the plants were in the bag, the levels of aldehydes and ketones both decreased slowly but continuously, indicating removal by the plants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectroscopynow.com/coi/cda/detail.cda?chId=4&amp;id=22493&amp;type=Feature&amp;page=1 |title=S Down. Spectroscopynow.com (2009) "Houseplants as air fresheners" |publisher=Spectroscopynow.com |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies done in sealed bags do not faithfully reproduce the conditions in the indoor environments of interest. Dynamic conditions with outdoor air ventilation and the processes related to the surfaces of the building itself and its contents as well as the occupants need to be studied.

While results do indicate house plants may be effective at removing some VOCs from air supplies, a review of studies between 1989 and 2006 on the performance of houseplants as air cleaners, presented at the Healthy Buildings 2009 conference in Syracuse, New York, concluded "...indoor plants have little, if any, benefit for removing indoor air of VOC in residential and commercial buildings."&lt;ref&gt;JR Girman, T Phillips, H Levin. "Critical Review: How Well Do House Plants Perform as Indoor Air Cleaners?". Healthy Buildings 2009, Syracuse, NY. [http://www.buildingecology.com/articles/critical-review-how-well-do-house-plants-perform-as-indoor-air-cleaners/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since high humidity is associated with increased mold growth, allergic responses, and respiratory responses, the presence of additional moisture from houseplants may not be desirable in all indoor settings.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, 2004.

==HVAC design==
{{main|HVAC|Air handler|Ventilation (architecture)}}

Environmentally [[sustainable design]] concepts also include aspects related to the commercial and residential heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) industry. Among several considerations, one of the topics attended to is the issue of indoor air quality throughout the design and construction stages of a building's life.

One technique to reduce energy consumption while maintaining adequate air quality, is [[demand-controlled ventilation]].  Instead of setting throughput at a fixed air replacement rate, carbon dioxide sensors are used to control the rate dynamically, based on the emissions of actual building occupants.

For the past several years, there have been many debates among indoor air quality specialists about the proper definition of indoor air quality and specifically what constitutes "acceptable" indoor air quality.

One way of quantitatively ensuring the health of indoor air is by the frequency of effective turnover of interior air by replacement with outside air.  In the UK, for example, classrooms are required to have 2.5 outdoor [[air changes per hour]].  In halls, gym, dining, and physiotherapy spaces, the [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] should be sufficient to limit [[carbon dioxide]] to 1,500 ppm. In the USA, and according to ASHRAE Standards, ventilation in classrooms is based on the amount of outdoor air per occupant plus the amount of outdoor air per unit of floor area, not air changes per hour. Since carbon dioxide indoors comes from occupants and outdoor air, the adequacy of ventilation per occupant is indicated by the concentration indoors minus the concentration outdoors. The value of 615 ppm above the outdoor concentration indicates approximately 15 cubic feet per minute of outdoor air per adult occupant doing sedentary office work where outdoor air contains 385 ppm, the current global average atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration. In classrooms, the requirements in the ASHRAE standard 62.1, Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality, would typically result in about 3 air changes per hour, depending on the occupant density. Of course the occupants are not the only source of pollutants, so outdoor air ventilation may need to be higher when unusual or strong sources of pollution exist indoors. When outdoor air is polluted, then bringing in more outdoor air can actually worsen the overall quality of the indoor air and exacerbate some occupant symptoms related to outdoor air pollution. Generally, outdoor country air is better than indoor city air. Exhaust gas leakages can occur from furnace metal exhaust pipes that lead to the chimney when there are leaks in the pipe and the pipe gas flow area diameter has been reduced.

The use of [[air filter]]s can trap some of the air pollutants.  The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy section suggests that "[Air] Filtration should have a [[Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value]] (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999."{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}  Air filters are used to reduce the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils.  Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can reduce the efficiency of the coils.

Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperatures sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture indoors is associated with a higher prevalence of occupant respiratory problems.

The "dew point temperature" is an absolute measure of the moisture in air. Some facilities are being designed with the design dew points in the lower 50s °F, and some in the upper and lower 40s °F. Some facilities are being designed using desiccant wheels with gas-fired heaters to dry out the wheel enough to get the required dew points. On those systems, after the moisture is removed from the make-up air, a cooling coil is used to lower the temperature to the desired level.

Commercial buildings, and sometimes residential, are often kept under slightly positive air pressure relative to the outdoors to reduce [[Infiltration (HVAC)|infiltration]].  Limiting infiltration helps with moisture management and humidity control.

Dilution of indoor pollutants with outdoor air is effective to the extent that outdoor air is free of harmful pollutants. Ozone in outdoor air occurs indoors at reduced concentrations because ozone is highly reactive with many chemicals found indoors. The products of the reactions between ozone and many common indoor pollutants include organic compounds that may be more odorous, irritating, or toxic than those from which they are formed. These products of ozone chemistry include formaldehyde, higher molecular weight aldehydes, acidic aerosols, and fine and ultrafine particles, among others. The higher the outdoor ventilation rate, the higher the indoor ozone concentration and the more likely the reactions will occur, but even at low levels, the reactions will take place. This suggests that ozone should be removed from ventilation air, especially in areas where outdoor ozone levels are frequently high. Recent research has shown that mortality and morbidity increase in the general population during periods of higher outdoor ozone and that the threshold for this effect is around 20 parts per billion (ppb).

== Building ecology ==
It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. “Building ecology “ is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.

Buildings constantly evolve as a result of the changes in the environment around them as well as the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The various surfaces and the air inside a building are constantly interacting, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, we may see a window as changing slightly over time as it becomes dirty, then is cleaned, accumulates dirt again, is cleaned again, and so on through its life. In fact, the “dirt” we see may be evolving as a result of the interactions among the moisture, chemicals, and biological materials found there.

Buildings are designed or intended to respond actively to some of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and maintain surfaces to enhance their appearance, performance, or longevity.  In other cases, such changes subtly or even dramatically alter buildings in ways that may be important to their own integrity or their impact on building occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it useful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, some of the approaches used by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our buildings.

Building ecology was first described by Hal Levin in an article in the April 1981 issue of Progressive Architecture magazine.

==Institutional programs==
The topic of IAQ has become popular due to the greater awareness of health problems caused by mold and triggers to [[asthma]] and [[allergies]].  In the US, awareness has also been increased by the involvement of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], who have developed an "IAQ Tools for Schools" program to help improve the indoor environmental conditions in educational institutions (see external link below).  The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] conducts Health Hazard Evaluations (HHEs) in workplaces at the request of employees, authorised representative of employees, or employers, to determine whether any substance normally found in the place of employment has potentially toxic effects, including indoor air quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/ |title=NIOSH Topic Area - Indoor Environmental Quality |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of scientists work in the field of indoor air quality including chemists, physicists, mechanical engineers, biologists, bacteriologists and computer scientists.  Some of these professionals are certified by organisations such as the American Industrial Hygiene Association, the American Indoor Air Quality Council and the Indoor Environmental Air Quality Council.

On the international level, the International Society of Indoor Air Quality and Climate (ISIAQ), formed in 1991, organises two major conferences, the Indoor Air and the Healthy Buildings series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isiaq.org |title=Isiaq.Org |publisher=Isiaq.Org |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISIAQ's journal ''Indoor Air'' is published 6 times a year and contains peer-reviewed scientific papers with an emphasis on interdisciplinary studies including exposure measurements, modeling, and health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0905-6947 |title=Indoor Air: International Journal of Indoor Environment and Health - Journal Information |publisher=Blackwellpublishing.com |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Tanner was born on 1 August 1920 in [[Camberley]], Surrey, United Kingdom and was educated at [[Marlborough College]] and [[University of Exeter|University College of the South West of England]]. His family travelled widely while he was a youth because his father, a soldier in the [[British Army]], was stationed in various locations. Tanner was a top-ranked [[hurdling|hurdler]] who might well have participated in the [[1940 Summer Olympics]] which were to be held in London, but were cancelled after the outbreak of [[World War II]]. He decided to become a doctor and not follow his father into the military after his brother was killed early in the war.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; He attended [[St Mary's Hospital, London]], under a scholarship in which he instructed fellow students in physical education.&lt;ref name=NYT2005/&gt; He went to the United States to complete his medical studies as part of a group of British students funded by a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref name=NYT2005/&gt; He met his first wife, fellow physician Bernice Alture, while at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] and performed his [[internship (medicine)|internship]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Weber, Bruce. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/24/science/24tanner.html "Dr. James M. Tanner, an Expert in How Children Grow, Is Dead at 90"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 23 August 2010. Retrieved 24 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanner oversaw a study initiated by the British government at an orphanage in [[Harpenden]] starting in 1948. While the study had originally been planned to study the effects of malnutrition on children, Tanner charted and photographed the growth of the children in the study over a period of several years, developing the Tanner Scale, which measures sexual maturation in adolescents based on characteristics that can be objectively measured, including size of the genitals and the quantity of pubic hair.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; The data gathered led to the development of the modern [[growth chart]], used by paediatricians around the world to monitor the pattern of growth in children through adolescence, with separate curves measuring the growth trajectory for boys and girls identified as maturing early, normal or late.&lt;ref name=NYT2005&gt;Hall, Stephen S. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/01/science/01tann.html "With His Bells and Curves, Human Growth Science Grew Up"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 March 2005. Retrieved 24 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on his research, Tanner noted that 90% of an individual child's adult height is based on genetic factors, but that the environment is the key factor when thousands of children are studied. By studying the growth characteristics of large populations, Tanner concluded that community-wide data on adult height was an indicator of how a society fosters its youths.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

Tanner did early research on the use of [[human growth hormone]] to address children whose growth was significantly delayed and was responsible for selecting the small handful of children in the UK who would be treated with the limited supply of HGH extracted from human cadavers.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2005/&gt; After a number of patients worldwide died in 1985 due to an infectious brain disease spread by the HGH treatments, Tanner immediately stopped the therapy, but had patients who insisted that they were willing to take the risk to address their child's delayed growth. Treatments resumed in the 1990s following the introduction of genetically engineered human growth hormone.&lt;ref name=NYT2005/&gt;

Tanner died at age 90 on 11 August 2010 in [[Wellington, Somerset]], due to a stroke and [[prostate cancer]]. He was survived by his second wife, Gunilla, as well as by a daughter, Helen Phillips, a stepdaughter, a stepson and three granddaughters.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

'''''Lebensreform''''' ("life reform") was a social movement in late 19th-century and early 20th-century [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]] that propagated a back-to-nature lifestyle, emphasizing among others [[health food]]/[[raw food]]/[[organic food]], [[nudism]], [[sexual liberation]], [[alternative medicine]], and religious reform and at the same time abstention from alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and vaccines.&lt;ref name="hr"&gt;[http://hippy.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=243 "Hippie Roots &amp; The Perennial Subculture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924180439/http://hippy.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=243 |date=2010-09-24 }} — also contains excerpts from Kennedy (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fm" /&gt;

Important ''Lebensreform'' proponents were [[Sebastian Kneipp]], [[Louis Kuhne]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Karl Wilhelm Diefenbach]], [[Fidus]] (Hugo Höppener), [[Gustav Gräser]], and [[Adolf Just]]. Some practitioners of ''Lebensreform'' such as [[Bill Pester]], [[Benedict Lust]], and [[Arnold Ehret]] emigrated to [[California]] in the late 19th (Lust) or first half of the 20th century and directly influenced the later [[hippie]] movement.&lt;ref name="hr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fm"&gt;''[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]]'' magazine, issue 122 (April 2009): ''[http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/nature_boy/ Tune in, Drop out] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103172022/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/nature_boy/ |date=2010-01-03 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; One group,  called the "Nature Boys", settled in the California desert. [[eden ahbez]], a member of this group, wrote a hit song called ''[[Nature Boy]]'' (recorded in 1947 by [[Nat King Cole]]), popularizing the homegrown back-to-nature movement to mainstream America.  Eventually, a few of these Nature Boys, including [[Gypsy Boots]], made their way to Northern California in 1967, just in time for the [[Summer of Love]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="hr" /&gt;

One noticeable legacy of ''Lebensreform'' in Germany today are the ''[[Reformhaus]]'' ("reform house") retail stores that sell naturopathic medicine and organic food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fritzen | first1 = F. | title = Changing the World with Müsli | journal = German Research | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 10 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1002/germ.201090000}} — [http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/dfg_magazin/wissenschaft_oeffentlichkeit/forschung_magazin/german_research_3_09_en.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Lebensreform movement in Germany originally was a politically diverse movement. There were hundreds of groups across Germany dedicated to some or all of the concepts associated with Lebensreform: ecology and organic farming, vegetarianism, [[naturism]] (''freie Körperkultur or FKK''), and abstinence from alcohol and tobacco. Dozens of magazines, books, and pamphlets were published on these topics. Some groups were made of socialists, some were apolitical, and some were rightwing and nationalist in outlook.&lt;ref name=Williams2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=John Alexander|title=Turning to nature in Germany : hiking, nudism, and conservation, 1900-1940|date=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, Calif.|isbn=9780804700153|pages=23–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RGemAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One outstanding prophet of Lebensreform was the painter [[Karl Wilhelm Diefenbach]] (1861-1913), a pacifist and tolstoyan anarchist who founded the community Himmelhof near Vienna. Among his disciples were three painters: Hugo  Höppener ([[Fidus]]), Frantischek Kupka and [[Gusto Graeser]].&lt;ref name=Williams2007/&gt; In 1900 Graeser became the cofounder and inspiring pioneer of the community [[Monte Verità]] near Ascona, Switzerland. Monte Verità attracted lots of artists from all of Europe, during World War I conscientious objectors from Germany and France. Gusto Graeser, thinker and poet, greatly influenced the German Youth Movement and such writers as [[Hermann Hesse]] and [[Gerhart Hauptmann]]. He was the model for the master figures in the books of Hermann Hesse.  [[Richard Ungewitter]] and [[Heinrich Pudor]] were also well known advocates of a strain of Lebensreform that emphasized nudism and was explicitly anti-Semitic, which eventually became [[Freikörperkultur]] movement.&lt;ref name=Williams2007/&gt;  The Freikörperkultur movement eventually broadened and came to include socialists with no strains of racism like [[Adolf Koch]], who for example organized factory workers to go on nudist hikes.&lt;ref name=Williams2007/&gt;

Contemporary environmental movements, the [[organic food]] movement, many [[fad diets]] and "back to nature" movements, as well as "folk movements", have their roots in the Lebensreform movement's emphasis on the goodness of nature, the harms to society, people, and to nature caused by industrialization, the importance of the whole person, body and mind, and the goodness of "the old ways".&lt;ref name=Williams2007/&gt;{{rp|40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hakl|first1=Hans Thomas|last2=McIntosh|first2=Christopher|title=Eranos: An Alternative Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317548133|page=272|quote=How can we explain the convergence of conservative-[[Völkisch movement|volkisch]] currents with the Lebensreform faction, the ecology movement,(103) early women's liberation and the opening to alternative forms of religion—a convergence that seems so surprising from today's perspective? A deep emotional chord is struck by the themes of one's own [[Volk]], of peace-giving religion, of the local soil that demands such careful nurturing, of one's own mother, indeed of the "feminine" in general. This chord vibrates again and again in the same register, which can best be characterized by the German word Geborgenheit, implying a reassuring sense of security against that which is new and strange.   Footnote 103: The ecology movement, which today tends to be seen as belonging to the left, had its origins in the Lebensreforrn groups of around the turn of the twentieth century, which were often marked by "volkisch" thinking and were influenced by the Wandervogel (wandering birds) movement. What they had in common was their opposition to the industrialization and urbanization of modern life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fitz"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fitzgerald M |title=Diet Cults: The Surprising Fallacy at the Core of Nutrition Fads and a Guide to Healthy Eating for the Rest of US |year=2014 |publisher=Pegasus Books |isbn=978-1-60598-560-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32–33}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer-Renschhausen|first1=E|last2=Wirz|first2=A|title=Dietetics, health reform and social order: vegetarianism as a moral physiology.

Another stream based on [[völkisch]] Romanticism gradually became part of Nazi ideology by the 1930s, known as [[blood and soil]]. As early as 1907, [[Richard Ungewitter]] published a pamphlet called ''Nudity and Culture'' (which sold 100,000 copies), arguing that the practices he recommended would be "the means by which the German race would regenerate itself and ultimately prevail over its neighbours and the diabolical Jews, who were intent on injecting putrefying agents into the nation's blood and soil".&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 2006, pp. 138–9&lt;/ref&gt;

The extremists promoting rightwing ideology eventually became popular among Nazi Party officials and their supporters, including [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Rudolph Höss]], who belonged to the right-wing farming organization the [[Artaman League]]. When other groups were being banned or disbanded due to political conflict during the 1930s, the extreme nationalist ideology became connected with Naziism. The [[German Life Reform League]] broke apart into political factions during this time. The Nationalist physician Artur Fedor Fuchs began the League for Free Body Culture (FKK), giving public lectures on the healing powers of the sun in the "Nordic sky", which "alone strengthened and healed the warrior nation".&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 2006, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient forest living, and habits presumed to have been followed by the ancient tribes of Germany, were beneficial to regenerating the Aryan people, according to Fuchs' philosophy. Hans Sùren, a prominent former military officer, published ''Man and the Sun'' (1924), which sold 240,000 copies; by 1941 it was reissued in 68 editions. Sùren promoted the Aryan [[master race]] concept of physically strong, militarized men who would be the "salvation" of the German people.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 2006, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Germany has been experiencing a growth of rightwing extremist organizations with ecological connections, including organic farming. Since the 1990s, a number of rightwing farmers have set up organic farming operations in [[Mecklenburg]]. The politically far-right environmental-interest magazine ''Umwelt und Aktiv'' (Environment and Active) is believed to receive support from the far-right nationalist [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Kate|title=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/28/germany-far-right-green-movement|accessdate=April 29, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; German publications ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' and ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' have also covered the link between far-right extremists and certain organic farming projects in Germany, and it has received government and academic attention as well. Speculation is that such rightwing projects may be attempts to revive the Nazi-era [[Artaman League]], to soften the image of the NPD, or to pull supporters away from the leftwing [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] (Green Party) of Germany, which is Europe's most successful environmentalist political party.

Unlike “respite” for caregivers, “medical respite” is short-term residential care that allows homeless individuals the opportunity to rest in a safe environment while accessing medical care and other supportive services. Medical respite programs provide hospitals with an alternative to discharging homeless patients to the streets or to unequipped shelters when patients would otherwise be discharged to their homes for self-care and recuperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Health Care for the Homeless Council|url=http://www.nhchc.org/resources/clinical/medical-respite/|accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing post-acute care and clinical oversight, medical respite programs seek to improve [[transitional care]] for this population and end the cycle of homelessness by supporting patients in access benefits and housing.

As of 2014, over 70 medical respite programs have been established across the United States and a number are in development. Medical respite programs are housed in a number of different facility types including homeless shelters, motel rooms, nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and stand-alone facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Respite Programs in the United States and Canada|url=http://www.nhchc.org/resources/clinical/medical-respite/tool-kit/medical-respite-programs-united-states-canada/|publisher=National Health Care for the Homeless Council|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest facility is based out of Boston, Massachusetts (United States), called the Barbara McIinnis House, which has 104 beds for men and women in need of a safe place to recuperate after leaving a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston Health Care for the Homeless: Specialized Services|url=http://www.bhchp.org/specializedservices.htm|publisher=Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program|accessdate=13 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113051144/http://www.bhchp.org/specializedservices.htm|archivedate=13 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national average length of stay in medical respite programs is 40 days (30 days median).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-medical-respite-program-directory.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120055306/http://www.nhchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-medical-respite-program-directory.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NABH''' ('''National Accreditation Board for Hospitals &amp; Healthcare Providers''') is a constituent board of Quality Council of India Certification, set up to establish and operate accreditation programme for healthcare organizations. NABH was established in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmijournal.org/article.asp?issn=0973-4651;year=2017;volume=15;issue=3;spage=231;epage=236;aulast=David cmijournal.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Organisations like the [[Quality Council of India]] (QCI) and its National Accreditation Board for Hospitals &amp; Healthcare Providers have designed an exhaustive [[healthcare]] standard for [[hospital]]s and healthcare providers. This standard consists of stringent 600 plus objective elements for the hospital to achieve in order to get the NABH [[accreditation]]. These standards are divided between patient centered standards and organization centred standards.

To comply with these standard elements, the hospital will need to have a process-driven approach in all aspects of hospital activities – from registration, admission, pre-[[surgery]], peri-surgery and post-surgery protocols, discharge from the hospital to follow up with the hospital after discharge. Not only the clinical aspects but the governance aspects are to process driven based on clear and transparent policies and protocols. In a nutshell, NABH aims at streamlining the entire operations of a hospital.

NABH is equivalent to [[Joint Commission International|JCI]] and other International standards including HAS: [[Haute Authorite de Sante]], [[Australian Council on Healthcare Standards]], the [[Japan Council for Quality in Health Care]], and the [[National Committee for Quality Assurance]] in the [[United States]]. Its standards have been accredited by ISQUA the apex body accrediting the accreditators hence making NABH accreditation at par with the worlds most leading hospital accreditation.

The official website of QCI should be referred for application and implementation of healthcare standards. The Quality Council of India works under the guidance of Ministry of Commerce.

'''History'''

NABH accreditation system was established in 2006 as a constituent of Quality Council of India (QCI). The first edition of standards was released in 2006 and after that the standards has been revised every 3 years. Currently the 4th edition of NABH standards, released in December 2015 is in use.

The first hospital to be accredited by NABH is 'Malabar Institute of Medical Sciences (MIMS), Kerala' which is a 650-bed multispeciality hospital and was accredited in 2007 and till date more than 350 hospitals in India has achieved accreditation by NABH. In public hospitals, Gandhinagar General hospital was the first to get NABH accreditation in 2009.

'''Standards'''

The NABH standards 4th edition standards are documented in 10 chapters, which are as follows

# Access, Assessment and Continuity of Care
# Care of Patients (COP)
# Management of Medication (MOM)
# Patient Rights and Education (PRE)
# Hospital Infection Control (HIC)
# Continual Quality Improvement (CQI)
# Responsibilities of Management (ROM)
# Facility Management and Safety (FMS)
# Human Resource Management (HRM)
# Information Management System (IMS)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3270">The '''National Outbreak Reporting System''' (NORS) is an electronic, web-accessible system designed to improve the quality, quantity, and availability of data for [[waterborne diseases|waterborne]], [[foodborne illness|foodborne]], enteric person-to-person, and enteric zoonotic (animal-to-person) disease outbreaks in the United States.

NORS launched in 2009 for use by staff working within public health departments in individual states, territories, and the Freely Associated States (composed of the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] and the [[Republic of Palau]]; formerly parts of the U.S.-administered Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands). Health departments are responsible for determining which staff members have access to NORS.

NORS replaced the electronic Foodborne Outbreak Reporting System (eFORS) - the primary tool for reporting foodborne disease outbreaks to the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]] since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch M, Painter J, Woodruff R, et al. Surveillance for Foodborne-Disease Outbreaks --- United States, 1998—2002 In: Surveillance Summaries, November 10, 2006. MMWR; 55(SS10);1-34&lt;/ref&gt; NORS also replaced the paper-based reporting system used during 1971-2008 to report waterborne disease outbreaks to the [[Waterborne Disease and Outbreak Reporting System|Waterborne Disease and Outbreak Reporting System (WBDOSS)]].&lt;ref&gt;Yoder J, Hlavsa M, Craun GF, et al.

Surveillance for waterborne disease and outbreaks associated with drinking water and water not intended for drinking—United States, 2005-2006. In: Surveillance Summaries, September 12, 2008. MMWR; 57(No. SS-9): 39-69.&lt;/ref&gt; The transition to electronic waterborne disease outbreak reporting is in large part a response to the [http://www.cste.org/dnn/ Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE)] position statement titled "[http://www.cste.org/PS/2006pdfs/PSFINAL2006/06-ID-12FINAL.pdf Improving Detection, Investigation, and Reporting of Waterborne Disease Outbreaks]."

Separate sections in NORS for enteric person-to-person and animal-to-person disease outbreak reports are intended to enhance the information available to quantify, describe and understand these types of outbreaks at a national level.

Their house became a meeting place for Africans such as [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]], the first President of [[Nigeria]], and [[Jomo Kenyatta]] of [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name=Richards20070402/&gt;
While in London, in 1945 he was one of the founders of the pan-Yoruba cultural society ''[[Egbe Omo Oduduwa]]'', and was the first president. Members included [[Obafemi Awolowo]], Secretary, [[Akintola Williams]], [[Saburi Biobaku]], [[Ayo Rosiji]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''''P. and S. v. Poland''''' is a decision by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in which the court ruled that the state of Poland had improperly hindered a 14-year-old girl in [[Lublin]], P., from her right to an abortion. The other plaintiff in the case was S., her mother, born in 1974.&lt;ref name=IT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2012/1031/1224325939242.html |title=14-year-old rape victim hindered in abortion attempts |author=Kitty Holland |date=31 October 2012 |work=The Irish Times |accessdate=1 November 2012 |archivedate=1 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BrPoEApE |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P. had become pregnant in 2008. Polish law allows abortion if the pregnancy is the consequence of a criminal act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.euractiv.com/sections/health-consumers/poland-debates-abortion-302791 | title = Poland debates abortion | date = 13 June 2014 | accessdate = 14 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the law, on 20 May 2008, P. received a certificate from the public prosecutor attesting that she could get an abortion because she was fourteen, and sexual intercourse with minors below the age of fifteen is a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language = pl | url = http://tygodnik.onet.pl/kraj/final-sprawy-nastolatki-jednak-aborcja/20vlz | title = Finał sprawy nastolatki: jednak aborcja | date = 18 June 2008 | accessdate = 14 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language = pl | url = http://www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/Artykul/714340,Strasburg-14latka-miala-prawo-do-aborcji | title = Strasburg: 14-latka miała prawo do aborcji | date = 30 October 2012 | accessdate = 14 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; P. and S. went to two hospitals in Lublin to have an abortion performed, but the hospitals refused.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; A gynecologist at one of the hospitals brought her to see a [[Roman Catholic]] priest without asking her permission, and the priest urged her not to have an abortion. Following an argument with S., the gynecologist refused to perform the abortion.&lt;ref name=IT/&gt; Hospital officials issued a press release about the case, following which P.'s situation was nationally debated.&lt;ref name=R&gt;{{cite news |agency=Reuters |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-poland-abortion-courtbre89t1ac-20121030,0,3559690.story |title=Europe rights court condemns Poland in abortion rape case |date=30 October 2012 |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=1 November 2012 |archivedate=1 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BrPfGFjx |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; After her case became publicly known, P. was harassed by anti-abortion activists.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20143558 |title=Polish rape victim 'should have had abortion access' |date=30 October 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=1 November 2012 |archivedate=1 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BrPG5oqt |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P. and S. then went to a hospital in [[Warsaw]]. Doctors there expressed reluctance to perform the procedure, stating that they were under pressure not to do so.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; P. and S. were then taken in for police questioning, and S. accused of attempting to force P. to have an abortion. P. was then placed in a juvenile shelter, and authorities began proceedings to take custody of the girl away from S. After a complaint by S. to the [[Ministry of Health (Poland)|Ministry of Health]], P. was allowed to have an abortion in [[Gdańsk]].&lt;ref name=IT/&gt;

The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that Poland had violated Article 3 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the "prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment".&lt;ref name=R /&gt; The court stated that P.'s difficulties increased due to "the lack of a clear legal framework, procrastination of medical staff and also as result of harassment". The decision went on to note that "[t]he court was particularly struck that the authorities started criminal proceedings for illicit sexual relations against the adolescent who, according to the prosecutor and medical reports, should have been considered the victim of sexual abuse". Poland was ordered to pay €15,000 to P. and €30,000 to S., and €16,000 to each for court costs.&lt;ref name=IT/&gt;

Following the ruling, [[Amnesty International]] urged Poland to "take urgent steps to ensure women and girls have full access to sexual and reproductive health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/poland-must-implement-landmark-european-court-ruling-abortion-2012-10-31 |title=Poland must implement landmark European Court ruling on abortion |date=31 October 2012 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=1 November 2012 |archivedate=1 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BrRuASTl |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Irish Times]]'' stated that the decision had implications for Ireland, which had a pending case regarding a failure to provide a legal framework for abortion.&lt;ref name=IT/&gt;

'''Para-cycling''' (or Paracycling) is the sport of [[cycling (sport)|cycling]] adapted for cyclists who have various [[disability|disabilities]]. It is governed by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI). The sport consists of seven different events which include [[Road bicycle racing|road]] and [[Track cycling|track]] races. The world's elite para-cyclists compete at [[UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships|Worlds Championships]], the [[Cycling at the Summer Paralympics|Paralympic Games]] and the [[UCI World Cups|World Cup]].&lt;ref name=uci&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uci.ch/para-cycling/about/ |title=Para-cycling – About |publisher=Uci.ch |date= |accessdate=2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Para-cycling originated in the 1980s, starting with visually impaired riders who competed on a tandem with a sighted partner. It entered the Summer Paralympic Games in 1984, where it consisted of only road races for riders with cerebral palsy. By 1996 track cycling was included and a variety of disabilities in various functional categories. [[Handcycling]] was included in the 2000 Paralympics in Sydney Australia as an exhibition event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingireland.ie/page/disciplines/paracycling |title=Cycling Ireland &amp;#124; Paracycling |publisher=Cyclingireland.ie |date= |accessdate=2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
[[File:Scott McPhee and Kieran Modra riding 01.jpg|thumbnail|A tandem bicycle with the visually impaired cyclist in the rear seat, in front is the [[sighted pilot]]]]
Para-cycling events consist of the following three road races and four track events:&lt;ref name = uci /&gt;

===Road===
* Road race (men and women)
* Individual time trial (men and women)
* Handcycling relay

===Track===
* Tandem sprint (men)
* Team sprint (men and women, mixed event)
* 500 m or 1000 m time trial (men and women)
* Individual pursuit (men and women)

==Classification==
{{main|Para-cycling classification}}
Classification of riders consists of four broad groups; visual impairment, cerebral palsy, mobility impairment and handcycling. These are subdivided into 14 functional categories for men and women. Riders are placed in the appropriate category according to their functional ability.&lt;ref name = uci /&gt;

Since the mid-20th century, '''plutonium in the environment''' has been primarily produced by human activity. The first plants to produce [[plutonium]] for use in [[cold war]] [[atomic bombs]] were at the [[Hanford nuclear site]], in Washington, and [[Mayak]] nuclear plant, in Russia. Over a period of four decades,&lt;ref name=plutopia&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.plutopia.net/ | title=Plutopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; “both released more than 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment -- twice the amount expelled in the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in each instance”.&lt;ref name=katebr/&gt;

The majority of [[plutonium]] [[isotope]]s are short-lived on a geological timescale,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/plutonium.pdf |title=Plutonium |work=Human Health Fact Sheet |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory, EVS |date=August 2005 |accessdate=2009-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225154131/http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/plutonium.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though it has been argued that traces of the long-lived [[Plutonium-244|&lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]] isotope, still exist in nature.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Kuroda, ''Accounts of Chemical Research'', 1979, '''12'''(2), 73-78 [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=6315763]&lt;/ref&gt; This isotope has been found in [[lunar soil]],&lt;ref&gt;KURODA, P.K., MYERS, W.A., "Plutonium-244 Dating III Initial Ratios of Plutonium to Uranium in Lunar Samples."

Donard, F. Bruneau, M. Moldovan, H. Garraud, V.N. Epov and D. Boust, ''Analytica Chimica Acta'', 2007, '''587''', 170-179 &lt;!--10.1016/j.aca.2007.01.047--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plutonium production==
[[Image:Hanford N Reactor adjusted.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hanford site]] represents two-thirds of the nation's high-level radioactive waste by volume. Nuclear reactors line the riverbank at the Hanford Site along the [[Columbia River]] in January 1960.]]

[[Richland, Washington]] was the first city established to support plutonium production at the nearby [[Hanford nuclear site]], to power the American nuclear weapons arsenals. [[Ozyorsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast|Ozersk, Russia]] supported plutonium production to power the Soviet nuclear arsenals at the [[Mayak]] nuclear plant. These were the first two cities in the world to produce plutonium for use in [[cold war]] [[atomic bombs]].&lt;ref name=katebr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/article/153096 |title=Kate Brown: Nuclear "Plutopias" the Largest Welfare Program in American History |author=Robert Lindley |year=2013|work=History News Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013 book &lt;ref name=plutopia/&gt; on a history of these two blighted cities, ''[[Plutopia|Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters]]'' (Oxford), [[Kate Brown (professor)|Kate Brown]] explores the health of affected citizens in both the United States and Russia, and the “slow-motion disasters” that still threaten the environments where the plants are located. According to Brown, the plants at Hanford and Mayak, over a period of four decades, “both released more than 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment -- twice the amount expelled in the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in each instance”.&lt;ref name=katebr/&gt;

Most of this [[radioactive contamination]] over the years at Hanford and Mayak were part of normal operations, but unforeseen accidents did occur and plant management kept this secret, as the pollution continued unabated. Even today, as pollution threats to health and the environment persist, the government keeps knowledge about the associated risks from the public.&lt;ref name=katebr/&gt;

== Bomb detonations ==
[[Image:Trinityglassactivity.png|right|450px|thumb|Levels of radioactivity in the trinitite glass from two different samples as measured by gamma spectroscopy on lumps of the glass. The americium content is the current content while all the other isotopes have been back calculated to shortly after the moment of detonation.]]
[[Image:Pubeforeandaftertrinity.png|right|450px|thumb|Isotropic signatures of the plutonium before and after the detonation.]]

About 3.5 tons of plutonium have been released into the environment by atomic bomb tests. While this might sound like a large amount it has only resulted in a very small dose to the majority of the humans on the earth. Overall the health effects of [[fission products]] are far greater than the effects of the actinides released by a nuclear bomb detonation. The plutonium from the fuel of the bomb is converted into a high-fired [[oxide]] that is carried high into the air. It slowly fall to earth as global [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] and is not soluble, and as a result it is difficult for this plutonium to be incorporated into an organism if ingested. Much of this plutonium is absorbed into sediments of lakes, rivers and oceans. However, about 66% of the plutonium from a bomb explosion is formed by the neutron capture of uranium-238; this plutonium is not converted by the bomb into a high fired oxide as it is formed more slowly. This formed plutonium is more soluble and more harmful as fallout.&lt;ref name=Choppin&gt;Radiochemistry and Nuclear Chemistry, G. Choppin, J-O. Liljenzin and J. Rydberg, 3rd Ed, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Some plutonium can be deposited close to the point of detonation. The glassy [[trinitite]] formed by the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity bomb]] has been examined to determine what actinides and other radioisotopes it contained. A recent paper&lt;ref&gt;P.P. Parekh, T.M. Semkow, M.A. Torres, D.K. Haines, J.M. Cooper, P.M. Rosenberg and M.E. Kitto, ''Journal of Environmental Radioactivity'', 2006, '''85''', 103-120 &lt;!--10.1016/j.jenvrad.2005.01.017--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; reports the levels of long lived radioisotopes in the trinitite. &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Eu and &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Eu was mainly formed by the neutron activation of the [[europium]] in the soil, and the level of radioactivity for these isotopes is highest where the neutron dose to the [[soil]] was larger. Some of the &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co was generated by activation of the [[cobalt]] in the soil, but some was also generated by the activation of the cobalt in the [[steel]] (100&amp;nbsp;foot) tower on which the bomb stood. This &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co from the tower would have been scattered over the site reducing the difference in the soil levels. &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Ba and &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am were created by the neutron activation of barium and plutonium inside the bomb. The [[barium]] was present in the form of the nitrate in the chemical explosives used while the plutonium was the [[fissile]] fuel used.

As the &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu/&lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Pu ratio only changed slightly during the Trinity detonation, it has been commented&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Y. Saito-Kokubu, F. Esaka, K. Yasuda, M. Magara, Y. Miyamoto, S. Sakurai, S. Usuda, H. Yamazaki, S. Yoshikawa and S. Nagaoka, ''Applied Radiation and Isotopes'', 2007, '''65'''(4), 465-468 &lt;!--10.1016/j.apradiso.2006.10.010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; that this isotope ratio for the majority of atomic bombs (in Japan the &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu/&lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Pu ratio in soil is normally in the range 0.17 to 0.19&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;S. Yoshida, Y. Muramatsu, S. Yamazaki and T. Ban-nai, ''Journal of Environmental Radioactivity'', 2007, In Press {{doi|10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.01.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is very different than from the bomb dropped upon [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].

== Bomb safety trials ==
[[Image:Fission bomb assembly methods.svg|right|thumb|250px|The two basic fission weapon designs.]]

Plutonium has also been released into the environment in ''safety trials''. In these experiments, [[nuclear bombs]] have been subjected to simulated accidents or detonated with an abnormal initiation of their chemical explosives. An abnormal implosion will result in a compression of the [[plutonium pit]], which is less uniform and smaller than the designed compression in the device. In these experiments where no or very little [[nuclear fission]] occurs, plutonium metal has been scattered around the test sites. While some of these tests have been done underground, other such tests were conducted in open air. A paper on the [[radioisotope]]s left on an island by the [[France|French]] nuclear bombs tests of the 20th century has been printed by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and a section of this report deals with plutonium contamination resulting from such tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1028_web.pdf |title=THE RADIOLOGICAL SITUATION AT THE ATOLLS OF MURUROA AND FANGATAUFA |isbn=92-0-101198-9 |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency |year=1998 |accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other related trials were conducted at [[Maralinga, South Australia]] where both normal bomb detonations and "safety trials" have been conducted. While the activity from the fission products has decayed away almost totally (as of 2006) the plutonium remains active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ret.gov.au/resources/Documents/radioactive_waste/martac_report.pdf |title=Resources (martac report) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110328131849/http://www.ret.gov.au/resources/Documents/radioactive_waste/martac_report.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mapw.org.au/conferences/mapw2000/papers/parkinson.html | title = Alan Parkinson - 2000 National Conference - MAPW Australia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201154126/http://www.mapw.org.au/conferences/mapw2000/papers/parkinson.html |archivedate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atomic batteries ==

[[Image:Cutdrawing of an GPHS-RTG.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Diagram of an RTG used on the [[Cassini probe]]]]

Plutonium can also be introduced into the environment via the reentry of artificial satellites containing [[atomic battery|atomic batteries]]. There have been several such incidents, the most prominent being the [[Apollo 13]] mission. The [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package]] carried on the [[Lunar Module]] re-entered the atmosphere over the South Pacific. Many atomic batteries have been of the [[Radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG) type. The Plutonium-238 used in RTGs has a [[half-life]] of 88 years, as opposed to the plutonium-239 used in [[nuclear weapons]] and [[Nuclear reactor|reactors]], which has a [[half-life]] of 24,100 years. {{full citation needed|date=December 2012}} In April 1964 a [[SNAP-9A Accident|SNAP-9A]] failed to achieve orbit and disintegrated, dispersing roughly {{convert|1|kg|lb}} of [[plutonium-238]] over all continents.

[[Image:Radioisotope thermoelectric generator plutonium pellet.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Image of (mostly) thermally isolated, RTG pellet glowing red hot because of [[incandescence]].]]

Chain reactions do not occur inside RTGs, so a [[nuclear meltdown]] is impossible. In fact, some RTGs are designed so that fission does not occur at all; rather, forms of [[radioactive decay]] which cannot trigger other radioactive decays are used instead. As a result, the fuel in an RTG is consumed much more slowly and much less power is produced. RTGs are still a potential source of [[radioactive contamination]]: if the container holding the fuel leaks, the radioactive material will contaminate the environment. The main concern is that if an accident were to occur during launch or a subsequent passage of a spacecraft close to Earth, harmful material could be released into the atmosphere. However, this event is extremely unlikely with current RTG cask designs.{{full citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In order to minimise the risk of the radioactive material being released, the fuel is typically stored in individual modular units with their own heat shielding. They are surrounded by a layer of [[iridium]] metal and encased in high-strength [[graphite]] blocks. These two materials are corrosion and heat-resistant. Surrounding the graphite blocks is an aeroshell, designed to protect the entire assembly against the heat of reentering the Earth's atmosphere. The plutonium fuel is also stored in a ceramic form that is heat-resistant, minimising the risk of vaporization and aerosolization. The ceramic is also highly [[solubility|insoluble]].{{full citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The US Department of Energy has conducted seawater tests and determined that the graphite casing, which was designed to withstand reentry, is stable and no release of plutonium should occur. Subsequent investigations have found no increase in the natural background radiation in the area.  The Apollo 13 accident represents an extreme scenario due to the high re-entry velocities  of the craft returning from cislunar space.  This accident has served to validate the design of later-generation RTGs as highly safe.

=== Nuclear fuel cycle ===

Plutonium has been released into the environment in aqueous solution from [[nuclear reprocessing]] and [[uranium enrichment]] plants. The chemistry of this plutonium is different from that of the metal oxides formed from [[nuclear bomb]] detonations.

One example of a site where plutonium entered the soil is [[Rocky Flats Plant|Rocky Flats]] where in the recent past [[XANES]] ([[X-ray]] spectroscopy) has been used to determine the chemical nature of the plutonium in the [[soil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David L. |last=Clark |url=http://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/research/highlights_archive/rockyflats.html |title=Cleanup at Rocky Flats |work=Los Alamos National Laboratory |publisher=Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource |date=2002-05-29 |accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The XANES was used to determine the [[oxidation state]] of the plutonium, while [[EXAFS]] was used to investigate the structure of the plutonium compound present in the soil and [[concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wmsym.org/archives/2002/Proceedings/6B/188.pdf | title = PLUTONIUM CONTAMINATION VALENCE STATE DETERMINATION USING X-RAY ABSORPTION FINE STRUCTURE PERMITS CONCRETE RECYCLE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because plutonium oxide is very involatile, most of the plutonium in the reactor was not released during the fire. However that which was released can be measured. V.I. Yoschenko ''et al.'' reported that grass and forest fires can make the [[caesium]], [[strontium]] and [[plutonium]] become mobile in the air again.&lt;ref&gt;(''Journal of Environmental Radioactivity'', 2006, '''86''', 143-163.)&lt;/ref&gt;

One case exists of a [[Germans|German]] man who attempted to poison his ex-wife with plutonium stolen from WAK (Wiederaufbereitungsanlage [[Karlsruhe]]), a small scale reprocessing plant where he worked.

== Environmental chemistry ==

=== Overview ===

Plutonium like other actinides readily forms a dioxide plutonyl core (PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  In the environment, this plutonyl core readily complexes with carbonate as well as other oxygen [[functional group|moieties]] (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) to form charged complexes which can be readily mobile with low affinities to soil.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

*PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;
*PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;
*PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6−&lt;/sup&gt;

PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formed from neutralizing highly acidic nitric acid solutions tends to form polymeric PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is resistant to complexation.  Plutonium also readily shifts valences between the +3, +4, +5 and +6 states.  It is common for some fraction of plutonium in solution to exist in all of these states in equilibrium.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

=== Binding to soil ===

Plutonium is known to bind to soil particles very strongly (see above for an X-ray spectroscopic study of plutonium in soil and [[concrete]]). While [[caesium]] has very different chemistry to the actinides, it is well known that both caesium and many of the actinides bind strongly to the [[mineral]]s in soil. Hence it has been possible to use &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs labeled soil to study the migration of Pu and Cs is soils. It has been shown that [[colloid]]al transport processes control the migration of Cs (and will control the migration of Pu) in the soil at the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant]] according to R.D. Whicker and S.A. Ibrahim.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Environmental Radioactivity'', 2006, '''88''', 171-188.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microbiological chemistry ===
Mary Neu (at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] in the USA) has done some work which suggests that [[bacteria]] can accumulate plutonium because the [[iron]] transport systems used by the bacteria also function as plutonium transport systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mary P. |last=Neu |url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/pubs/00818042.pdf |title=Siderophore-Mediated Chemistry and Microbial Uptake of Plutonium |publisher=Los Alamos Science |work=Chemical Interactions of Actinides in the Environment |pages=416–417 |date=Number 26, 2000 |accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/es010590g | pmid=11478246 | volume=35 | issue=14 | title=Siderophore mediated plutonium accumulation by Microbacterium flavescens (JG-9) |date=July 2001 | journal=Environ.

== Biology ==

Plutonium ingested by or injected into humans is transported in the [[transferrin]] based [[iron]](III) transport system and then is stored in the [[liver]] in the iron store ([[ferritin]]), after an exposure to plutonium it is important to rapidly inject the subject with a [[Chelation|chelating]] agent such as [[calcium]] complex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multum.com/Ca-DTPA.htm |title=Pentetate calcium trisodium injection (Ca-DTPA) |publisher=Cerner Multum |accessdate=2009-07-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928012951/http://www.multum.com/Ca-DTPA.htm |archivedate = September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[DTPA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orau.gov/reacts/calcium.htm ORISE: Radiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training Site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multum.com/Zn-DTPA.htm |title=Pentetate zinc trisodium injection (Zn-DTPA) |publisher=Cerner Multum |accessdate=2009-07-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928012945/http://www.multum.com/Zn-DTPA.htm |archivedate = September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This antidote is useful for a single exposure such as that which would occur if a [[glove box]] worker were to cut his or her hand with a plutonium-contaminated object. The calcium complex has faster metal binding kinetics than the [[zinc]] complex but if the calcium complex is used for a long time it tends to remove important minerals from the person. The zinc complex is less able to cause these effects.

Plutonium that is inhaled by humans lodges in the lungs and is slowly translocated to the [[lymph nodes]]. Inhaled plutonium has been shown to lead to lung cancer in experimental animals.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The '''President's Malaria Initiative''' (PMI) is a U.S. Government initiative to control and eliminate [[malaria]], one of the leading global causes of premature death and disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/can-malaria-be-eradicated|title=Can Malaria Be Eradicated?|work=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was originally launched by U.S. president [[George W.

PMI was originally created with a mission to "reduce malaria-related mortality by 50 percent across 15 high-burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa".&lt;ref name="AboutPMI" /&gt; PMI has since expanded to 24 malaria-endemic countries in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and 3 additional countries in the [[Greater Mekong Subregion]] of Southeast Asia, where it seeks to further reduce malaria burden and assist countries in achieving malaria elimination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pmi.gov/docs/default-source/default-document-library/pmi-reports/2018-pmi-twelfth-annual-report.pdf|title=The President's Malaria Initiative, 12th Annual Report to Congress|last=|first=|date=|website=PMI.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ''U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003'' originally authorized the U.S. Government to provide 5 years of malaria funding to bilateral partners and the Global Fund. PMI was subsequently launched by President George W. Bush in 2005. In 2008, PMI was reauthorized for another 5 years of funding by the ''Lantos-Hyde Act,'' which also called for development of a comprehensive U.S. Global Malaria Strategy, the latest version of which is the U.S. Global Malaria Strategy 2015-2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-government-and-global-malaria/|title=The President’s Malaria Initiative and Other U.S. Government Global Malaria Efforts|date=2018-04-10|work=The Henry J.

== Structure and Governance ==
PMI is interagency initiative overseen by the [[U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator]] in consultation with an Interagency Advisory Group composed of representatives from [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], and [[Office of Management and Budget]]. The initiative is led by USAID and implemented together with CDC. In addition to US-based staff at USAID and CDC headquarters, PMI maintains resident advisors from both agencies in each focus country.&lt;ref name="AboutPMI" /&gt;

== Countries ==
PMI currently provides direct support to 24 "focus" countries and 3 additional country programs in the Great Mekong Subregion. At the time of its launch in 2005, PMI provided support to just three countries: Angola, Tanzania, and Uganda. Four additional countries (Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Senegal) were added the following year. By 2007, PMI had added Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, and Zambia—bringing the total number of focus countries to the originally envisioned total of 15 high-burden nations.&lt;ref name="AboutPMI" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In 2010, PMI added the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Guinea, Zimbabwe, and the Mekong Subregion. &lt;ref name="AboutPMI" /&gt;

In 2017, with additional funding from Congress, PMI expanded to 5 more countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Niger, and Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Results ==
PMI is estimated to have prevented 185 million malaria cases and nearly 1 million deaths between 2005 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winskill|first=Peter|last2=Slater|first2=Hannah C.|last3=Griffin|first3=Jamie T.|last4=Ghani|first4=Azra C.|last5=Walker|first5=Patrick G.

The '''quahog parasite unknown''', or '''QPX''', is a parasite in the [[protist]] kingdom. It affects [[hard clam]]s, or quahogs,&lt;ref name="prevalence"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ragone Calvo|first1=L.M.|last2=Walker|first2=J.G.|last3=Burreson|first3=E.M.|title=Prevalence and distribution of QPX, Quahog Parasite Unknown, in hard clams Mercenaria mercenaria in Virginia, USA|journal=Diseases of Aquatic Organisms|date=Jul 30, 1998|volume=33|issue=3|pages=209–19|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/dao/33/d033p209.pdf|pmid=9745718|doi=10.3354/dao033209}}&lt;/ref&gt; both cultured and wild.&lt;ref name="sheet"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coen|first1=Loren|last2=Bobo|first2=M.

Parasites similar to QPX were first observed in New Brunswick, Canada, in 1959. Outbreaks have also occurred in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Virginia, always only in quahog clams. The life stages of thalli, [[endospores]], and [[sporangia]] have been observed.&lt;ref name="prevalence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seagrant"&gt;{{cite web|title=QPX Disease in Hard Clams|url=http://www.seagrant.sunysb.edu/seafood/pdfs/QPX-Brochure03.pdf|publisher=Sea Grant New York|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

QPX was originally considered a [[chytrid]], but has now been provisionally assigned to the phylum [[Labyrinthulomycota]] in either the families Thraustochytriidae or Labyrinthulidae, based on the organism having a "[[uninucleate]] biflagellate [[zoospore]] stage, a loose multilaminar cell wall, and particularly an intracellular sagenogen-like structure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/dao/42/d042p185.pdf|last1=Ragan|first1=Mark A.|last2=MacCallum|first2=Greg S.|last3=Murphy|first3=Colleen A.|last4=Cannone|first4=Jamie J.|last5=Gutell|first5=Robin R.|last6=McGladdery|first6=Sharon E.|title=Protistan parasite QPX of hard-shell clam Mercenaria mercenaria is a member of Labyrinthulomycota|journal=Diseases of Aquatic Organisms|date=28 September 2000|volume=42|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, much about it is still unknown.&lt;ref name="prevalence"/&gt; QPX-like organisms also may not be all of the same species.&lt;ref name="sheet"/&gt;

Symptoms of QPX include chipping of the shells, mantle swelling, stunted shell growth and the development of nodules.&lt;ref name="seagrant"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sheet"/&gt;

==Pioneer in nutrition research==
McCarrison carried out the very first experiments to demonstrate the effect of [[nutrition]] on the [[epidemiology]] of disease.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

McCarrison is credited with being the first to experimentally demonstrate the effect of deficient dietaries upon animal tissues and organs.&lt;ref name=BMJPMC2314713&gt;{{citation |date=13 June 1931 |title=Surgery and Diet |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=3675 |pages=1031–1032|pmc=2314713 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.2841.1031-a}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also carried out human experiments aimed at identifying the cause of goitre, and included himself as one of the experimental subjects.&lt;ref name=BMJPMC2318200&gt;{{citation |date=13 February 1909 |title=The Etiology of Goitre |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=2511 |page=434|pmc=2318200 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.2511.427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of McCarrison's work was pioneering. His 1921 book ''Studies in Deficiency Disease'' was considered notable at the time, being published at a time when knowledge of vitamins and their role in nutrition was crystallizing.&lt;ref name=Halliburton1921&gt;{{citation |date=18 June 1921 |author=Halliburton, W.D |title=Deficiency Disease (book review) |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=3155 |pages=896–897|pmc=2415481 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.3155.896}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McCarrison himself noted that prior to publication of his studies on the pathogenesis of deficiency disease "no systemic ''post-mortem'' examination of animals fed on food deficient in [[vitamin B]] had ever been made; the histopathological effects of such food on the various systems of the body were wholly unknown; above all, its effects on the gastro-intestinal tract and the organs of digestion and assimilation, and the significance of these effects for clinical medicine, were wholly unsuspected".&lt;ref name=McCarrisonPMC2523693&gt;{{citation |date=10 April 1926 |author=McCarrison, R |title=Vitamin Deficiency |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=3406 |page=674|pmc=2523693 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.3406.674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 23, McCarrison went to India, where he spent 30 years on nutritional problems.&lt;ref name=Moore1953&gt;{{citation |date=25 April 1953 |author=Moore, T |title=Nutrition and Health (book review) |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=4816 |page=922 |pmc=2016372 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4816.922}}.

The first lecture focused on the processes of nutrition; the second, on food essentials and their relationship to bodily structure and function; the third on disease prevention and physique improvement by attention to diet.&lt;ref name=McCarrisonPMC2457947&gt;{{citation |date=29 February 1936 |author=McCarrison, Sir Robert |title=Nutrition and National Health |series=Cantor Lectures by Sir Robert McCarrison |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=3921 |pages=427–430 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.3921.427 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pdf_extract/1/3921/427 |pmc=2457947 |accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lectures were subsequently published in book form under the title ''Nutrition and Health'', and at the time of the third edition in 1962, were still not seen as "dated", with the advances of the preceding 25 years largely filling the details of the principles previously recognised by McCarrison.&lt;ref name=Widdowson1963&gt;{{citation |date=January 1963 |author=Widdowson, E.M |title=Nutrition and Health, being the Cantor Lectures delivered before The Royal Society of Arts, together with Two Earlier Essays (book review) |journal=British Journal of Industrial Medicine |volume=20 |issue=1 |page=69|pmc=1038277 |doi=10.1136/oem.20.1.69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"McCarrison's work on goitre, [[cretinism]], and  [[thyroid]], begun in the western Himalayas in 1902, generated scores of scientific publications during the following thirty-five years",&lt;ref name=Miles1998&gt;{{citation |year=1998 |author=Miles, M |title=Goitre, cretinism and iodine in South Asia: historical perspectives on a continuing scourge |journal=Medical History |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=47–67|pmc=1043968 |pmid=9536623 |doi=10.1017/s002572730006333x}}&lt;/ref&gt; While McCarrison's work is often considered the start of serious studies of goitre and cretinism in [[South Asia]], it was preceded by that of Commissioner [[David Scott]] at Rangur in north-east India around 1825, and was investigated by Mountford Bramley at [[Kathmandu]] in 1832.&lt;ref name=Miles1998/&gt;

In 1918, McCarrison founded the ''Beri-Beri Enquiry Unit'' in a single room laboratory at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Conoor, India.&lt;ref name=NINorigins/&gt; He was invalided to Britain from 1920–1922, and in 1923 the enquiry was axed on financial grounds. It was restored two years later as the ''Deficiency Disease Inquiry'', which McCarrison headed from 1925-1929.&lt;ref name=Arnold2000&gt;{{citation |year=2000 |author=Arnold, David |title=Science, technology, and medicine in Colonial India |series=[[The New Cambridge History of India]].

Renamed the [[National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad|National Institute of Nutrition]] in 1969),&lt;ref name=NINorigins/&gt; with McCarrison as its first Director, until his retirement in 1935.&lt;ref name=Moore1953/&gt;&lt;ref name=NINorigins&gt;{{citation |title=Down the memory lane |publisher=National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India |url=http://www.ninindia.org/nin.htm |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arnold2000/&gt; In 1926, as head of the ''Deficiency Diseases Inquiry'', McCarrison submitted written and oral evidence on [[malnutrition]] to the ''Royal Commission on Agriculture in India''.&lt;ref name=McCarrison1928RoyalComm&gt;{{citation |year=1928 |author=McCarrison, Lieut.-Colonel R|chapter=Memorandum on Malnutrition as a cause of physical inefficiency and ill-health among the masses in India (pp.96-98); Oral evidence (pp.99-116) | chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/evidenceofoffice031789mbp#page/n118/mode/1up |series=Evidence of Officers serving under the Government of India |title=Royal Commission on Agriculture in India.

"A decade later, when the Commission's chairman, [[Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Linlithgow]], became Viceroy of India he showed a personal interest in nutrition, pushing it to the top of the research agenda. In 1936 a Nutrition Advisory Committee was established and roughly a tenth of IRFA's annual grants went to fund nutrition research at Coonoor and [[Calcutta]]".&lt;ref name=Arnold2000/&gt;

==Retirement from India==
After [[the Second World War]], from 1945 to 1955, McCarrison served  as director of postgraduate [[medical education]] at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name=McCarrisonObituary28051960/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1906 he married Helen Stella Johnston, to whom he was still married at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=McCarrisonObituary28051960/&gt;

==Legacy==
* The National Institute of Nutrition in [[Hyderabad]], India, continues to pay tribute to is origins in 1928 under McCarrison.&lt;ref name=NINorigins/&gt;
* McCarrison is grouped, along with [[Albert Howard|Sir Albert Howard]] and [[Richard St. Barbe Baker]], as one of three progenitors of the [[Organic farming|organic agriculture]] movement.&lt;ref name=Mantle&gt;{{citation |author=Mantle, Paul |title=Two Reviews (see review of ''Origins of the Organic Movement'') |work=Tributes |page=7 |publisher=The Man of the Trees: Richard St. Barbe Baker |url=http://www.manofthetrees.org/HTMLS/reviews.htm |accessdate=14 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108223659/http://www.manofthetrees.org/HTMLS/reviews.htm |archivedate=8 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sayre&gt;{{citation |date=4 March 2004 |author=Sayre, Laura |title=Review: ''The Origins of the Organic Movement'' |publisher=[[The Rodale Institute|Rodale Institute]] |url=http://newfarm.rodaleinstitute.org/books/reviews/march04/origins.shtml |accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===McCarrison Society===
In 1966, a group of doctors, dentists and veterinarians, interested in the promotion of nutrition and health, founded the McCarrison Society in honour of his efforts,&lt;ref name=Ferry1983&gt;{{citation |date=6 October 1983 |author=Ferry, Georgina |title=Eat your way to mental health |journal=[[New Scientist]] |volume=100 |issue=1378 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0aIiC-z5_kC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22eat+your+way+to+mental+health%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22eat%20your%20way%20to%20mental%20health%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCarrisonSociety/&gt; with a [[Scotland|Scottish]] group established in 1981 due to both travel logistics and differing needs in the Scottish population.&lt;ref name=McCarrisonSociety/&gt;

The Society aims "to assemble scientific knowledge on nutrition and health that is free from economic and political pressures with the object of securing the physical and mental health of future generations".&lt;ref name=McCarrisonSociety&gt;{{citation |title=The McCarrison Society (Scottish Group) |url=http://www.foodforhealthscotland.org/McCarrison%20Society%20Scottish%20Group%20flyer%201.pdf |accessdate=13 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726061343/http://www.foodforhealthscotland.org/McCarrison%20Society%20Scottish%20Group%20flyer%201.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society meetings sometimes raise questions with elusive answers, with speakers presenting material based on scanty, often anectdotal data, inviting criticism that it is "a gathering of cranks". However, "one answer to that criticism is that speakers at MCarrison meetings tend to be rather well qualified. But the main point is that the society has a way of asking questions about the environment - what are we doing to it and what it is doing to us - that are of profound importance".&lt;ref name=NewScientisteditorial&gt;{{citation |date=6 October 1983 |author=Editorial |title=Big questions with elusive answers |journal=New Scientist |volume=100 |issue=1378 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0aIiC-z5_kC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=%22big+questions%22+elusive#v=onepage&amp;q=%22big%20questions%22%20elusive&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society's website summarises McCarrison's work thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
His researches were extensive; they included work on the newly discovered [[vitamins]] and on the contrasting disease patterns in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. He demonstrated how many common diseases increasingly prevalent in industrial societies were caused simply by diets made defective by extensive food processing, often with the use of chemical additives. He deplored the universal consumption in Britain and America of refined white flour, instead of [[halite flour]], and the substitution of canned, preserved and artificially sweetened products for fresh natural food.
&lt;br/&gt;
McCarrison's work was widely published in the medical press. He was honoured for his discoveries, but completely ignored by government and the medical profession at a time when medical thought was absorbed in the study of disease rather than on prevention and the promotion of health.&lt;ref name=McCarrisonSummary&gt;{{citation |title=Sir Robert McCarrison |publisher=McCarrison Society for Nutrition and Health |url=http://www.mccarrisonsociety.org.uk/founders-of-nutrition-othermenu-149/134-sir-robert-mccarrison |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note_label|a|a|none}} The bulk of McCarrison's work appears to have been published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' (BMJ), although he did publish in other journals, such as ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' and ''[[The Lancet]]'', amongst others. Some publications are also found in the ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine]]''. Free access to publications ''BMJ'' and the ''Proceedings'' is to be found in the external links section. Some of McCarrison's publications listed are from those journals, but links were not located at time of listing. They should however, be available at these websites, along with other publications by or about McCarrison from those two journals which have not been located or listed.

'''b.''' {{Note_label|b|b|none}} This letter is by the "nominal overseer" of McCarrison's last salaried post. It contains particularly insightful commentary on the contribution of McCarrison at a time of significant change in the existing university and medical institutions of the UK.

'''c.''' {{Note_label|c|c|none}} The author of this obituary letter on McCarrison is identified only as "N.C.P.", which are also the initials of N.C. Penrose, author of a 1951 letter defending the legacy of McCarrison's earlier works.

'''d.''' {{Note_label|d|d|none}} A book review of the 1953 edition is cited in this article, hence the listing. However, there have been other publications of this book both before and since. A publication from 1944 (''Nutrition and National Health'') is to be found via web searches comprising the same lecture and essay collection. And publications in 1961 and 1982, under ''Nutrition and Health'', are also to be found. A new edition was produced in 2010, and may found at Lulu, a [[Print on demand|Print on Demand]] / [[self publishing|Self-Publishing]] service.

He is best known as an [[Energy medicine|energy healer]] and a developer and teacher of unique [[Self-help|self-improvement]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |  url=http://www.neplaneta.ru/broadcast/radio-rossii/illyuziya-bytiya-ruben-papyan  |  script-title=ru:Иллюзия Бытия  |   language=Russian  |  accessdate=20 November 2012&lt;!--  |trans-title=--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ruben Papian was born in [[Yerevan| Yerevan, Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |  url=http://rubenpapian.wordpress.com/ruben-papian-biography | title=Ruben Papian biography | accessdate=20 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a very young boy, Ruben heard stories about the existence of UFO’s and life outside our planet. It was a shock for him. After this, his affection towards paranormal sciences and exploration began to grow. This made him different from other children. Not only because of his interests, but also because he was a fast learner and could communicate and socialize with people who were much older than him. This influenced his further growth.

In [[Armenia]], Ruben attended the Yerevan State University of Architecture and Construction. In addition to this he was also interested in painting and music. His musical career began when he was 12 years old. Ruben is the founder, leader and singer of a student rock band called Oleess that projects progressive ideas.

A turning point of his life was when his mother was diagnosed with a serious illness. Ruben could not do anything to help her – at the time he was only 18. One day an energy healer came to their family house to help cure the disease. Ruben saw him standing in front of her waving his hands. “I’ve never seen anything like that before. He was treating my mother with no medicine or medical equipment. The only thing he had were – his hands”.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite video | people = Ruben Papian | title = Herankar | medium = Television production | publisher = Shant TV | location = Armenia | date = 20 April 2011 | url= http://www.shanttv.com/am/programs/herankar/videogallery/6176/6177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the energy healer finished, Ruben expressed a wish to learn everything about the method he was using. The healer gave him a book called “Caucasian Yoga” by Count Stefan Colonna Walewski. It was hand-written in Russian and was the first step in Ruben’s self-tutoring. With this book came an understanding of human energy and a glance at the possibilities that he had within himself.

“When I was 16, I started noticing human pain. I don’t know how to explain it, but I knew if this or that person was sick. I could even see the exact place of the pain.” 
With “Caucasian Yoga” he started learning energy healing and this profession played an important role in his later life.

In 1987 Ruben was invited to go to Moscow. His energy healing abilities were highly appreciated by Soviet Union State Department officials. During the time he spent in Moscow, his energy method increased in both quality and efficiency in the area of anatomy, the nervous system and mind functions. He came to the conclusion that the main key to solving health problems lay in the mind. He developed a method called “Mental Correction and Communication”.&lt;ref name="code_one"&gt;{{cite video | people = Ruben Papian, Venera Nigmatulina | title = CODE 21 | medium =Television production | publisher =Tелеканале НТК | location =Almaty | date = March 2012 | url = http://earth-chronicles.ru/news/2012-03-03-18257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 he was invited to come to [[Yugoslavia]] to solve a certain health problem. After a few visits, in 1990 he decided to move to [[Belgrade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Ruben Papian | title = Moj Beograd | medium =Television production | publisher =StudioB | location = Belgrade | date = March 2005 | url = https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3433E3E0AA5451E9&amp;feature=plcp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yugoslavia with his family and formed a “Center for Alternative Healing” where he performed personal and group treatments using his method “Mental Correction and Communication”. By 1993 his knowledge had become enriched and he began to understand human complexity. It led to the formation of the association for personal harmonic development “The Golden Step”.&lt;ref name="code_one" /&gt;

In 1994 the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science in the Netherlands involved him in a project called “The theory and methodology of finding and developing the talents of gifted children”. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Аладьина | first = Татьяна | title = Экстрасенс Рубен Папян: грядет матриархат | newspaper = Экспресс К  | location = Almaty | date = 26 September 2011| url=http://www.express-k.kz/show_article.php?art_id=61013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he moved to the Netherlands, and from 1995 to 1998 he continued [[energy healing]], mentored different courses, worked in an International [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company as a negotiation trainer for high management.&lt;ref name="code_one" /&gt;

From 1998 to 2005 the name Ruben Papian became well-known worldwide. 
In 2005 Ruben developed “The Golden Step” into the first “Institute of Esotery and Parapsychology Ruben Papian” in [[Belgrade]], Yugoslavia. The Institute offered educational programs such as Energy Therapy Healing, Mental Correction and Communication and Harmonic Personal Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |  url=http://lkm.fri.uni-lj.si/xaigor/slo/zdravilci/ruben.htm  |  title=Ruben Papian, strokovnjak notranje in zunanje mentalne komunikacije  |  author=Kononenko, Igor  |  date=September 2002  |  accessdate=20 July 2012  |  language=Slovenian  |trans-title=Ruben Papian, internal and external mental communication expert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 in the Netherlands Ruben developed a construction called “The Energy Pyramid”. Ever since he started researching cosmic energies, he had become interested in pyramids, the way they function and affect the human organism. In a short time he developed an energy flow concept and understood the basis of the mystical powers of those large monuments that could be found anywhere in the world.

In 2008 Ruben produced an Armenian movie called “Welcome Papa”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |  url=http://www.bravo.am/news/“welcome-papa-kam-bari-gnalust  |  title=Welcome Papa  |  language=Armenian  |  date=October 2010  |   accessdate=20 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010 he has been Senior Advisor of the International [[Challenge:Future]] competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://challengefuture.org/us/advisory/ Challenge Future, Advisory board&lt;/ref&gt; Challenge:Future is an international youth [[think tank]] and competition that connects corporate and global challenges with the power of youth-driven innovation based on sustainability principles.

At the very start of 2011, the “Institute of Esotery and Parapsychology Ruben Papian” in Belgrade, Serbia became the “SFERA movement”. Thanks to his great success and to the people who were interested in his unique training methods, Ruben opened another “SFERA movement” in [[Kazakhstan]], [[Almaty]] in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |  url=http://mir24.tv/news/society/4670946  |  script-title=ru:В алматинской школе экстрасенсов обещают научить ясновидению каждого  |   language=Russian   |  date=February 2012  |  accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 he wrote his first book, ''How to Wish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  url=http://www.thebooksofessence.com/ |  title=How to Wish Page |  accessdate=20 November 2012 |  deadurl=yes |  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111020552/http://thebooksofessence.com/ |  archivedate=11 January 2014 |  df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This book is in the first part of a transformational series called “The Books of Essence”.

'''''Savage Dragon''''' is an ongoing American [[comic book]] series created by [[Erik Larsen]], published by [[Image Comics]] and taking place in the [[Image Universe]]. The comic features the adventures of a [[superhero]]ic [[police officer]] named the Dragon. The character first appeared as Dragon in ''Graphic Fantasy'' #1 (June 1982) and first appeared as the "Savage Dragon" in ''Megaton'' #3 (February 1986).

The Dragon is a large, finned, green-skinned humanoid whose powers include [[Superhuman strength|super-strength]] and an advanced healing factor. He is also an [[amnesia]]c: his earliest memory is awakening in a burning field in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. Thus, for most of the series, the origins of his powers and appearance are a mystery to readers. At the beginning of the series, he becomes a police officer and battles the [[mutant (fiction)|mutant]] criminal "superfreaks" that terrorize Chicago.

''Savage Dragon'' is one of only two Image Comics titles that debuted during the company's 1992 launch that continues to be published well into the late 2010s,&lt;ref name=Paste&gt;Hennum, Shea (March 12, 2015). [https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/03/what-spawn-means-to-the-future-of-image.html "What ''Spawn'' Means to the Future of Image"]. ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the only one of the two that for most of its run, has been written and drawn almost entirely by its creator (with the exception of one issue), for which Larsen has been lauded.&lt;ref&gt;[[David, Peter]] (August 23, 2010).

Reprinted from ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' #1033 (September 3, 1993). [[Krause Publications]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Savage Dragon'' is the longest running American full-color comic book to feature a single artist/writer.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The character was also adapted into an [[The Savage Dragon (TV series)|animated series]], which ran for two seasons (26 episodes) on the [[USA Network]] beginning in 1995.

Savage Dragon was listed by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' as the 116th-greatest comic book characters of all time.&lt;ref name=Wizard&gt;{{cite web | url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wizard/4010-2081/forums/wizards-top-200-comic-book-characters-644479/ | title=Wizard's top 200 characters.

==Publication history==
Like many of Erik Larsen's characters, the Savage Dragon was created by Larsen while he was a child in elementary school. In his youth, Larsen drew the Dragon in homemade comic books. The original Dragon, inspired by elements from [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Batman]], [[Speed Racer]] and later [[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]], differs greatly from the modern incarnation. After launching ''Savage Dragon'' in a professionally published comic book, Larsen returned to the original and reworked his designs into the characters William Jonson, a police officer ally of the Dragon, and Flash Mercury, the "Spectacular Dragon".

Much later, a greatly redesigned ''Savage Dragon'' was featured in two issues of ''Graphic Fantasy'', a self-published title with a small print run, published by Larsen and two friends. In this incarnation, the Dragon was a widower and a retired member of a government-sponsored superhero team. Subsequently, the Dragon made another appearance in the third issue of [[Gary Carlson]]'s ''Megaton'' anthology in its ''[[Vanguard (Image Comics)|Vanguard]]'' strip, which Larsen had been drawing. In these appearances, the character of the Dragon remained basically the same as it had been in ''Graphic Fantasy'', with a few details modified (such as the inclusion of his wife, who was dead in his previous incarnation). Both the ''Graphic Fantasy'' and ''Megaton'' issues containing the Dragon have since been reprinted in high-quality editions.

In 1992, when Larsen left [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] to co-found Image Comics, he reworked the character for the new publication venture. This time, the Dragon was a massively [[muscle]]d green amnesiac, who joined the Chicago police department after being discovered in a burning field. Initially debuting in a three-issue mini-series, the ''Savage Dragon'' comic book met with enough success to justify a monthly series, launched in 1993. To this day, Larsen continues to write and illustrate the series entirely by himself, and has maintained a reasonably consistent monthly schedule (save for occasional lapses) in comparison with the other original Image Comics titles. Larsen has occasionally produced ancillary mini-series, and sometimes allowed other creators to produce stories featuring the Dragon or other characters from the series.

According to Larsen, the series is aimed at "older Marvel readers who are about ready to throw in the towel on comics altogether. It's the missing link between Marvel and [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]]. More mature than Marvel; less pretentious than Vertigo. The kind of comics [he wants] to read. [The] book is really self-indulgent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savagedragon.com/faq.htm|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=SavageDragon.com|author=Larsen, Erik|accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
For the initial mini-series and the first 38 issues of the ongoing series, the Dragon was a full officer of the Chicago Police Department, and partnered with officer Alex Wilde. Dragon and Wilde would later have a casual sexual relationship. He received the name of "Dragon" (due to his fin and green skin) from Nurse Ann Stevens, who would later become a supporting character in ''[[Mighty Man (Image Comics)|Mighty Man]]''.

===Mini-series===
The Dragon was found in a burning field by Lt. Frank Darling. At the time, Chicago was being terrorized by villainous "superfreaks" (Larsen's collective term for superpowered characters), namely the criminal gang called the [[Vicious Circle (comics)|Vicious Circle]], led by the mysterious [[Overlord (comics)|Overlord]]. Realizing that the Dragon's superhuman powers would be a terrific boon to the police in battling the Vicious Circle, Darling asks the Dragon to join the police. At first, the Dragon refuses and takes a job in the warehouse of Darling's cousin. After a number of serious incidents, including the murder of the superhero Mighty Man and the brutal mauling of [[SuperPatriot]], Darling takes drastic action. He pays Vicious Circle members to threaten his cousin in the hope that it will prompt Dragon to re-consider his offer. Although this achieves Darling's desired result, the two criminals, Skullface and Hardware, kill Darling's cousin and detonate a bomb in his warehouse. The Dragon joins the police, but Darling is now under the thumb of the Vicious Circle, causing him to steer the Dragon away from Vicious Circle activities.

Later, the Dragon gains a girlfriend, Debbie Harris, only to see her shot dead in his apartment by her jealous ex-boyfriend Arnold Dimple. The Dragon falls into a deep depression as a result. Dimple returns to plague the Dragon on several occasions as the Fiend, who makes a deal with the [[Devil]] to gain supernatural powers.

===Chicago PD===
As well as being kept away from Vicious Circle activities, the Dragon was loaned out to other police forces across the country to help them in dealing with superpowered criminals. While on loan to the [[NYPD]], he first met the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]], whom he assisted multiple times in later comics. Also during his time in New York, a large prison break occurred and a number of powerful and dangerous criminals were killed. This is the first time the Chicago PD lost a star witness against Overlord; Hardware, who intended to give evidence against the criminal, was shot dead.

Though Captain Darling's [[Freak Force]] program failed&lt;!--needs expansion/explanation--&gt;, the Dragon carried on a lasting relationship with one of its former members: [[Rapture (comics)|Rapture]], a former prostitute with electrical powers, who would later have his child. Meanwhile, Overlord's second-in-command [[Cyberface]] broke away from the Vicious Circle to form a rival organization. Cyberface was later arrested but, like Hardware before him, he was killed before he was able to testify. Ultimately Cyberface was resurrected and later led the Vicious Circle under the control of Horde, another recurring villain.

Later, the Dragon made his first attempt to arrest the Overlord, who easily defeated him and left him impaled upon a church [[spire]]. The Dragon was believed to be dead but regenerated from his wounds afterwards. This is not the only time the Dragon was missing and presumed dead; it becomes both a recurring theme and running joke in the series. During his recovery, Dragon was attacked by a person under the mental control of a strange worm. Under the domination of this creature, the Dragon went on a rampage during which many innocent bystanders are injured or killed. He was finally stopped by the [[vigilante]] Mace, and the worms were traced to Horde. The rampage resulted in a massive negative backlash against the Chicago Police Department, and the Dragon's biggest naysayer, R. Richard Richards, took this opportunity to attack the Dragon with a robotic weapon dubbed "Dragon Slayer". Later, the Dragon encountered the [[She-Dragon]], a young superpowered woman who modeled herself after him.

Following an attack on the police station and the murder of Cyberface (who is later resurrected), the Dragon led a SWAT team to finally take down the Overlord. The battle was harsh, and every member of the SWAT team perished except for the Dragon, who was skinned alive. Even in his weakened state, the Dragon finally unmasked the Overlord as [[Italian Mafia|mafia]] boss Antonio Seghetti, who subsequently falls to his death.

After aiding the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for a second time, the Dragon narrowly survived another attack by the Fiend, which left him nearly crippled after his bones healed incorrectly. To make matters worse, Chicago was in the midst of a brutal gang war that arose as a result of the Overlord's death. The Vicious Circle, once kept tightly organized by the Overlord, had since separated into several factions that were battling for criminal supremacy. The Dragon was found by a friendly cabbie and Mighty Man, who used his super-strength to re-set the Dragon's bones. After recuperating from this ordeal, the Dragon fought another prison break, this time in a maximum security facility torn open by a newly-resurrected Cyberface. This battle marked the end of the gang war, and Cyberface assumed command of the Vicious Circle.

This victory was followed by difficult times for the Dragon. After a number of crossovers with other Image Comics characters including [[WildStar (Image Comics)|WildStar]] and [[The Maxx]], the Dragon encountered Spawn and ultimately was sent to [[Hell]] by the Fiend. The Fiend can possess living bodies, and his powers are fuelled by the capacity for hate of those possessed. His last victim was Debbie Harris' mother, who was unaware that the demon possessing her was the spirit of her daughter's murderer. While in Hell, a fist-fight occurred between [[God]] and the Devil. As God finally overcomes the Devil, he warned his defeated opponent: "Don't fuck with God." Just as the amnesiac Dragon begins to ask about his origins, God returned him to Earth.

Afterward, things grow steadily worse for the Dragon. He was unable to save ill fellow officer Phil Dirt with a blood transfusion. Meanwhile, Rapture (pregnant with the Dragon's child) suffered internal damage when the baby kicked—the unborn child having inherited its father's strength—and Rapture entered premature labour. The Dragon was not able to reach the hospital in time, and the baby appeared to have died. However, in truth, the infant was taken by the [[Covenant of the Sword (comics)|Covenant of the Sword]], a shadowy organization bent on world takeover.

After a crossover with [[Hellboy]], the Dragon was caught up in the ''[[Mars Attacks]]'' (Image) and ''Mars Attacks/Savage Dragon'' event, in which he was responsible for destroying the [[Martian]]s' bases on Mars using a Martian growth ray. This resulted in their retreat and possible extinction. While he was gone, the Vicious Circle had taken control of the city. Returning home to a devastated Chicago, the Dragon was captured and publicly crucified by the Circle. The Dragon survived and defeated most of the villains, but the Dragon's new superior, Captain Mendoza, suspended him for having been missing for so long. During his suspension, the Dragon spent a few months as a [[bounty hunter]] and helped rebuild the city after the Martian invasion.

===S.O.S. years===

Behind the scenes during this period, [[Rob Liefeld]] departed from Image Comics. The ''Mars Attacks Image'' event and the ''Shattered Image'' crossover were used as a way to phase out characters created by Liefeld from the collective "Image Universe", including [[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]. In the pages of the ''Savage Dragon'', Larsen has the Dragon approached by the United States government to form a superhuman task-force to replace Youngblood. After negotiations, the team is dubbed the Special Operations Strikeforce, or S.O.S. This team includes much of the super-powered supporting cast of the book, including [[Jennifer Murphy (comics)|Jennifer Murphy]], a super-strong, invulnerable single mother first introduced in ''[[The Savage Dragon: Sex &amp; Violence]]'' mini-series. Despite being the founding member of the team, the Dragon spends little time as a member.

(''Savage Dragon'' 40)]]  --&gt;Later, on a dying parallel Earth, a murderous despot named [[Damian Darklord|Darklord]] begins to swap parts of his Earth with parts from the Dragon's. The Dragon leads a team of S.O.S. members, including Jennifer Murphy and his former girlfriend Rapture, to this world to stop Darklord. Rapture is killed by Darklord, and the Dragon and Jennifer are separated from the rest of the team. While the remaining members of S.O.S. manage to stop the transfer and escape back to their own Earth, the Dragon and Jennifer are forced to find their own way off of the dying planet. While they make their escape, Dragon attempts to find this Earth's Rapture, only to find that world's Debbie Harris instead.

The threesome is lost in space for some months, and Dragon is once again presumed dead, eventually landing on Godworld, where Debbie dies but is revived as an angel. Dragon and Jennifer are caught in a battle between [[Thor]] and [[Hercules]], and then sent back to Earth by All-God; Debbie does not return with them. Following this, Dragon fights a [[Dr. Doom]]-like armored dictator before returning to Chicago on leave and striking up a casual sexual relationship with his former partner Alex Wilde.

In giant-sized issue 50, many of the series subplots are resolved, and in a climactic battle among most of the series cast, the Dragon is killed by the mystic Abner Cadaver; however, the wizard is murdered midway through this by William Jonson, and the Dragon is bonded with him.

===William Jonson and the new Overlord===
{{Main|She-Dragon}}
The series changed its title to ''Savage She-Dragon'' for five issues, featuring her as the main character during an attack by The God Squad to retrieve the various super-freaks that were descendants of gods. This led to the S.O.S. returning to Godworld and its accidental destruction by S.O.S. member and former Deadly Duo member Kid Avenger. During this time, William Jonson realizes he and the Dragon are sharing bodies, and shortly thereafter Dragon finds he has the ability to take over Jonson's body, so they become a masked superhero. While he is helping She-Dragon, Jonson's fiancé, Rita Medermade, is kidnapped by Jonson's brother Ralph and they both encounter an individual wearing the Overlord armor. While rescuing her, Jonson is shot, Ralph is killed by Overlord, and Dragon is given full possession of his body.

Abner Cadaver returns—made up of parts of dead God Squad characters, Darklord, and Dragon's arm—and engages in battle with Fon~Ti, the mystical being who was once Horde. After Fon~Ti’s victory, he separates the Dragon from Jonson and returns the Dragon to his normal body. Having admitted their love, Jennifer and Dragon begin to date. After a fight with Impostor, posing as Rapture, Dragon proposes to Jennifer, and their wedding follows in the next issue, in which Jennifer is apparently killed by the new Overlord. In truth, she was replaced with Impostor beforehand by the Covenant of the Sword. Though he had only been semi-active before, the Dragon officially resigns from the S.O.S. and became the legal guardian of Jennifer's daughter Angel. In the following issue, the Overlord subplot is tied up after the Dragon defeats his new team. The Dragon kills Overlord, and he is revealed as supporting character Vic Nixon, who had worn the armor to spy on Rita; the armor then corrupted him. After this, the Overlord armor is destroyed.

===Single parent and Damian Darklord===

Following the resolution of the new Overlord plot, the series spent most of its issues wrapping up all the remaining subplots. This was preparation for the eventual revamp in issue #75, with the Dragon as a single parent looking after Angel and eventually losing a custody battle for her because of his dangerous lifestyle. The Dragon dated a television producer named Marcy Howard, resumed his casual affair with Alex Wilde, and dated Ann Stevens before she is murdered, while a number of super-powered children and adults were kidnapped by the Covenant of the Sword.

After losing custody of Angel and Ann's murder, the Dragon and Mighty Man (now former Freak Force member [[Dart (comics)|Dart]]) began searching for the missing SuperPatriot. This led them to the Covenant of the Sword, which had in its possession SuperPatriot, Jennifer, and the Dragon's child. The Dragon and Mighty Man are captured but eventually rescued in a large battle similar to the one in issue #50 in which a number of characters are killed.

It was revealed that the Covenant was formed by Damian Darklord, a time traveler who was the enemy of a vigilante named Super-Tough. This man became Darklord and started life as Damian, the son of Liberty, SuperPatriot’s daughter who was raped during the ''Mars Attacks'' event. Damian also built and detonated the "Nega Bomb" made up of super-powered individuals that de-powered every non-natural "freak" in the world. The Dragon then kills him.

===''This Savage World''===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SD 76.jpg|thumb|left|190px|''Savage Dragon'' 76 cover]] --&gt;With issue #76, the series changed into a [[Jack Kirby]]-inspired post-apocalyptic/dystopian story. The Dragon is stuck in a new reality he created by killing the infant Damian Darklord, which prevented him from going back in time, and with most of the mutated and monstrous populace of this world trying to kill him. The Dragon finds his house to be a crater and believes Jennifer and Angel are dead. The Dragon has encounters with WildStar (Image Comics) and [[Madman (Image Comics)|Madman]] and finds out that during his time possessed, without Mace to stop him, he went on a much longer rampage, killing Alex Wilde. The Dragon also discovers that Cyberface is now president of America and has SuperPatriot under his control. The Dragon organizes a group of old enemies and allies to defeat Cyberface. After fulfilling a commitment to Rex Dexter—who helped him overthrow Cyberface—by saving his daughter, the Dragon returns a hero and finds his way back to Chicago and is reunited with Jennifer and Angel, who had in fact survived.

The Dragon then finds his old world had survived as well as the Savage World. His counterpart from Darkworld, this Dragon, was defeated, but the Dragon's old Earth was destroyed by a world-devouring [[Galactus]]-like being named Universo, despite the best efforts of the Dragon and his son, Malcolm, who are left floating in space after its destruction. The Dragon is able to save Alex Wilde from that world. After this, the Dragon marries Jennifer and lives with her, Angel, and Angel’s new "pet", Mr. Glum, who is secretly plotting to kill Dragon.

To coincide with the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Larsen created a corrupt politician Ronald Winston Urass, who engineers a successful write-in campaign to elect the Dragon president of the United States. However, once his criminal intents and relationship to the criminal Dread Knight are exposed, the Supreme Court disallows these votes. This leads a vengeful Urass to attack the Dragon using the armor of his father, Dread Knight, who was an old foe of SuperPatriot's.

Behind the scenes, Erik Larsen was made publisher of Image Comics, causing a nearly year-long publishing gap between issues #121 and #122 of the series. The title resumed regular publication in January 2006, with the first story involving a vengeful scientist from [[Iraq]] sending an almost unstoppable robot to kill the president.

Mr. Glum's plans for world domination were realized using the power of the God Gun (a weapon able to grant three wishes to its user). Glum fires the gun and asserts his control of the planet while the Dragon is incapacitated in a hospital, having lost his rapid healing abilities. Glum was, at the time, on the run with the Dragon's stepdaughter Angel after he caused her to grow to more than 100 feet tall, and she accidentally destroyed her house and crippled her mother. The two become partners and Angel adopts a murderous, merciless personality, while Glum set the people of Earth to work with the impossible task of making the planet look like his face (as his old world did).

The Dragon is revived with his healing abilities restored and is able to defy Glum's control because of a loophole in his wish that means he cannot control extraterrestrials. The Dragon is unable to get close enough to Glum due to the various robots and villains Glum has under his control. However, the intervention of a number of characters from the comic series ''[[Wanted (comics)|Wanted]]'', who had come to steal the God Gun, allows Dragon to destroy the weapon, negating Glum's wish.

During the story, Vanguard's spaceship is destroyed, freeing Universo who was imprisoned on it. He begins to suck the energy from Earth once more. Universo and its herald are killed by Solar Man, a [[Superman]]-like hero who became murderous and was wished out of existence using the God Gun, a wish undone by the Dragon's destruction of the weapon. She-Dragon also returns from Dimension X with the Angel from the Dragon's original world of origin. They are being pursued by the Darkworld Dragon and a new villainess Battleaxe.

===''Back to Basics''===
After Angel and Malcolm's return to the ''new world'', Savage Dragon is left to face a new array of troubles. With Jennifer having disappeared and presumed dead, two superstrong kids ill-equipped to face the return to normalcy after months spent in isolation (Angel has learning deficits and Malcolm is nearly illiterate), and no income to care for his family, Savage Dragon returns to the police force.

Meanwhile, a new Overlord takes over the Vicious Circle, resuming his attacks over the city, and Savage, hospitalized after a fight, is ambushed and killed by a new ''freak'' with the power to steal the memories and the lifeforce of his enemies. Due to the huge amount of lifeforce held by Dragon and his powerful immune system, the freak absorbs all of his memories and physical characteristic, becoming essentially a new iteration of the Dragon. The ''Impostor Dragon'' has the remains of his former body packed in a preservative solution by Rex, and resumes his normal life.

Even this new lease at life appears to be short-lived, as the New Overlord, after trying to bargain with Savage Dragon for his allegiance, literally blows his head and torso away: the ''Impostor Dragon'', brought in the Vicious Circle laboratories for analysis, revives himself as a crazed, unstoppable, deformed powerhouse with conflicting memories, bent on nourishing himself on the superpowered Angel and Malcolm.

Still knowing nothing about the actions of the ''Impostor Dragon'', Angel and Malcolm seek a way to revive the body of Savage Dragon, despite being faced by Rex with the prospect of creating nothing more than a soulless being or a mind-addled monstrosity, due to the brain matter lost during the attack. They set off to ask Nurse Stevens for the last blood sample of Dragon, hoping to use its regenerative abilities to speed up the recovery and the resurrection of the Savage Dragon corpse. The Vicious Circle, however, overpowers them, stealing the blood sample to create an army of Dragon clones.

As a last resort, after being faced by the ''Impostor Dragon'' who attacks Rex and is frozen in the preservative solution, Rex and Malcolm agree to transfuse part of Malcolm's blood into the Dragon corpse. The Dragon revives but has no memories of his former life.

===''Dragon Wars''===
Concerned about the new, harder attitude of the Dragon, the New Overlord sends the Dark Dragon after the Savage Dragon. Showing a callous disregard for human life, the Savage Dragon ultimately reveals to have regained every shred of his past memory as Kurr the Emperor (see above), and after beating up the Dark Dragon, he eats his brains, killing him for his defiance.

He then proceeds to alienate from himself Malcolm, planning vengeance over the Vicious Circle, now using Dragon's blood to empower his members. The New Overlord decides to strike a truce with the police department as seen in #159.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Erik (w, a). ''The Savage Dragon'' #159 (June 2010). Image Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; He lends the help of all the superfreaks in his command to stop Kurr. As the last attempt fails,&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Erik (w, a). ''The Savage Dragon'' #162 (September 2010). Image Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Kurr sheds his facade, proclaiming his identity and retelling his origins (see below), for the first time in-universe speaking, to Malcolm and Angel. Battling his way through several enemies, including Vanguard, an unnamed Shapeshifter taking She-Dragon's appearance, Glum, the ''original'' Angel, and other friends and foes from his past, Kurr cleanses Earth of human life using a special venom.

After he battles and kills Malcolm, the Impostor Dragon wakes up, this time with Savage Dragon's personality fully in charge, and avenges his offspring and world by killing the Kurr-Dragon. Damian Overlord proceeds to restore his original look and body, giving Savage Dragon the opportunity to greet his species and leave the cleansed Earth in their care.

Distraught by the consequences of Kurr's actions, he pleads with Damian Overlord for the power to travel back in time and kill Kurr before he unleashes the potion, thus creating another divergent timeline where his family is still alive. Damian grants his wish, mercilessly killing him shortly thereafter as "Savage Dragon is a dangerous wildcard for the world". Despite a [[red herring]] implying Damian transplanted Savage's personality into WildStar's body, in the "restored" timeline Kurr's alien son, along with a "mysterious gentleman", takes away Virus' corpse (as he's now calling the Impostor Dragon), taking it on to his spaceship, where Virus and Kurr are used to return Savage Dragon to life. Savage Dragon decides to keep his resurrection hidden to Earthlings, and to make amends with his species, offers to help them to find a suitable planet.

After the Dragon Wars, Malcolm Dragon has taken Savage Dragon's role, along with his sister Angel, acting as protectors of the city. A schism in the superfreaks has brought Overlord working with the police department, with a part of the freaks still engaging in villainy, and Malcolm to keep them in check.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arrant, Chris|url=http://www.newsarama.com/18689-death-and-the-savage-dragon-killing-off-the-title-character.html|title=Death and the SAVAGE DRAGON - Taking the Title Character Out of the Title?|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Burlingame, Russ|url=http://comicbook.com/blog/2014/02/19/savage-dragon-version-2-0-erik-larsen-on-the-first-day-of-malcolms-new-life/|title=Savage Dragon Version 2.0: Erik Larsen on The First Day of Malcolm's New Life|publisher=ComicBook.com|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=45629|title=Larsen Shakes Up 'Savage Dragon,' Updates 'Ant' Status|publisher=[[CBR.com]]|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin revealed===
Savage Dragon's origin was revealed in the ''Image Comics 10th Anniversary'' hardcover book, which was released on November 30, 2005. The collection featured stories by the four remaining Image founders (Erik Larsen, [[Todd McFarlane]], [[Marc Silvestri]], and [[Jim Valentino]]) returning to the characters they first created for the company. Larsen's story revealed that the Dragon used to be an evil tyrant named Emperor Kurr, who led a nomadic race of space aliens who spent thousands of years traveling through space, searching for a suitable new homeworld. After Kurr had chosen Earth, he decided to go against his people's peaceful ways and slaughter all humans. Two scientists named Rech and Weiko conspired against him, giving him brain damage that erased his memory, and implanted within his memories five days' worth of satellite television broadcasts from Earth. Kurr was then sent to live on Earth, while his race moved on to search for a new planet elsewhere.

The '''seven ill years''' was a period of national [[famine]] in Scotland in the 1690s. It resulted from an economic slump created by French [[protectionism]] and changes in the Scottish cattle trade, followed by four years of failed harvests (1695, 1696 and 1698–99). The result was severe famine and depopulation, particularly in the north. The famines of the 1690s were seen as particularly severe, partly because famine had become relatively rare in the second half of the seventeenth century, with only one year of dearth (in 1674). The shortages of the 1690s would be the last of their kind.

During this period, starvation probably killed 5–15 per cent of the [[Scottish population]], but in areas like [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] death rates reached 25 per cent. The system of the [[Old Scottish Poor Law]] was overwhelmed by the scale of the crisis, although provision in the urban centres of the [[burghs]] was probably better than in the countryside. It led to migration between [[Parishes of the Church of Scotland|parishes]] and emigration to England, Europe, the Americas and particularly Ireland. The crisis resulted in the setting up of the [[Bank of Scotland]] and the [[Company of Scotland|Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies]]. The eventual failure of the Company in the [[Darién scheme]] increased the pressure for political union with England, which [[Union with England Act|occurred in 1707]].

==Causes==
[[File:1000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png|thumb|Temperature comparisons, showing the "[[Little Ice Age]]"]]
Before the seventeenth century, with difficult terrain, poor roads and methods of transport, there was little trade between different areas of Scotland. Most settlements depended for subsistence on what was produced locally, often with very little in reserve in bad years. Most farming was based on the lowland [[Hamlet (place)#United Kingdom|fermtoun]] or highland [[Township (Scotland)|baile]], settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams. These were allocated in [[run rig]]s, of "runs" (furrows) and "rigs" (ridges), to [[tenant farmer]]s.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp41-55&gt;J.

Labourers on fixed incomes, along with pensioners, were particularly vulnerable to the impact of famine, but it also affected those with land, who could not save enough seed for future planting and feed their families. Even pastoral farmers were affected as the price of animal feed became unaffordable.&lt;ref&gt;K. J.

The closing decade of the seventeenth century saw the generally favourable economic conditions that had dominated since the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration of the monarchy]] in 1660, come to an end. There was a slump in trade with the Baltic and France from 1689–91, caused by French [[protectionism]] and changes in the Scottish cattle trade. These were followed by four years of failed harvests (1695, 1696 and 1698–99).&lt;ref name=Mitchison2002pp291&amp;301-2&gt;R. Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), {{ISBN|0415278805}}, pp. 291–2 and 301-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The period is named after the Biblical famine in Egypt predicted by [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] in the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Cullen, ''Famine in Scotland: The 'Ill Years' of the 1690s'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748638873}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The famine was evident for five years nationally and was present for less time in some regions. However, there is evidence that the harvest failures from 1685 followed years of relatively poor harvests from the 1680s and that the impact of poor harvests did not entirely subside until after 1700.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Cullen, ''Famine in Scotland: The 'Ill Years' of the 1690s'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748638873}}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1690s marked the lowest point of the [[Little Ice Age]], of colder and wetter weather.&lt;ref name=White2011pp542-3&gt;I.

==Impact==
[[File:Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|[[Greyfriars Kirkyard]], Edinburgh, where the town council erected a "refugee camp" to deal with the influx of starving families in 1696]]
The results of the climatic conditions were inflation, severe famine and depopulation, particularly in the north of the country. The price of oatmeal, the stable Scottish cereal crop, peaked in Aberdeen in 1698, which was particularly badly hit because of its reliance on the Baltic trade,&lt;ref name=Dingwall2001pp286-7&gt;H. M. Dingwall, "Health, famine and disease: 2 1500–1770" in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0199234825}}, pp. 286–7.&lt;/ref&gt; at 166.7 per cent of average prices for 1690–94.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Cullen, ''Famine in Scotland: The “Ill Years” of the 1690s'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748638873}}, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals were reduced to eating grass, nettles and rotten meat in order to survive.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Cullen, ''Famine in Scotland: The “Ill Years” of the 1690s'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748638873}}, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable eye-witness material indicating that large numbers of people died from starvation.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Cullen, ''Famine in Scotland: The “Ill Years” of the 1690s'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748638873}}, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1698 local [[tacksmen]] claimed that during the period 1695–97 "many people were starved to death for want, both in town and country" and in 1698 reports reached Edinburgh of people found dead on the roads throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Cullen, ''Famine in Scotland: The “Ill Years” of the 1690s'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748638873}}, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall deaths from starvation were 5 to 15 per cent, but in areas like [[Aberdeenshire]] they reached 25 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;J. Wormald, [https://books.google.com/books?id ''Scotland: A History''] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0191622435}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The young, the old and widows were particularly vulnerable.&lt;ref name=Dingwall2001pp286-7/&gt;

The famines led to a rapid increase in the number of [[pauper]]s and [[vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] taking to the roads to find work, charity and food. In 1698, [[Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun]] (1655–1716) estimated that perhaps one-sixth of the population of Scotland, about 200,000 people, had left their homes to beg for food and charity, a doubling of the 100,000 vagrants that he estimated travelled the country during non-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Cullen, ''Famine in Scotland: The “Ill Years” of the 1690s'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748638873}}, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this movement was within large parishes, which allowed families to continue to receive the poor relief that was officially confined to local residents. However, many of these families later moved further afield to major urban centres and to other countries, particularly England and Ireland. So many poor beggars arrived in Edinburgh in search of relief in December 1696 that the town council had to erect a "refugee camp" in [[Greyfriars kirkyard]] to house all of them. Other towns reacted by enforcing severe punishments for beggars.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Cullen, ''Famine in Scotland: The “Ill Years” of the 1690s'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748638873}}, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of the [[Old Scottish Poor Law]] was overwhelmed by the scale of the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|074860233X}}, pp. 127 and 145.&lt;/ref&gt; In the countryside, where the majority of the population lived, it relied on funds raised and distributed by the [[kirk session]], usually led by the parish minister and reliant on the generosity of local landholders, particularly the local [[laird]]. The role of the minister was undermined by the results of the change of regime in the [[Glorious Revolution in Scotland]], which meant that many [[Scottish Episcopal Church|episcopalian]] ministers had been ejected from their livings and had not been replaced by the time of the famines. In the urban settlements of the [[burgh]]s there were more mechanisms that could be used to provide for the poor. In addition to the kirk sessions and general sessions of the church, there were [[guild]]s, trades' societies and town councils. Town councils also had the ability to intervene in local grain markets in an attempt to maintain low prices in times of scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Cullen, ''Famine in Scotland: The “Ill Years” of the 1690s'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748638873}}, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of the famine may have been exacerbated in urban centres as the influx of new starving populations brought outbreaks of disease such as [[smallpox]], which are evident from [[parish register]]s for the period.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Cullen, ''Famine in Scotland: The “Ill Years” of the 1690s'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748638873}}, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
[[File:Riggs at Haddington.jpg|thumb|Runrig farming outside the town of [[Haddington, East Lothian]] c. 1690]]
These problems were not confined to Scotland; the years 1695-97 saw [[Great_Famine_of_1695–1697|catastrophic famine]] in present-day Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway and Sweden plus an estimated two million deaths in France and Northern Italy. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Vries|first1=Jan|title=The Economic Crisis of the 17th Century|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies|date=2009|volume=40|issue=2|pages=151-194|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/ghcc/event/events/40_2_de-vriesjih2009.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its historical significance and impact is partly due to the fact famine had become relatively rare in the second half of the seventeenth century, with only 1674 being one of dearth and these were to be the last of their kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchison|first1=Rosalind|title=A History of Scotland|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415278805|pages=254-5|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions resulted in limited migration between estates and parishes in Scotland; emigration to England was limited by [[English Poor Laws]] preventing distribution of relief to strangers, while continental Europe had the same issues. It may have been a factor in emigration to the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] and the [[West Indies]] by volunteers as [[indentured servants]], which became the most significant form of transatlantic emigration from Scotland in this period.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Cullen, ''Famine in Scotland: The “Ill Years” of the 1690s'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748638873}}, pp. 173–4.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1650 to 1700, approximately 7,000 Scots emigrated to America, 10–20,000 to Europe and England and 60–100,000 to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;T.

Canny, ed., ''Europeans on the Move'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994), {{ISBN|0198204191}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 20,000 migrated to Ireland from 1696-1698; these numbers were part of a continuation of the [[Ulster Plantation]], with cheap confiscated land available in the north after the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]] of the early 1690s.&lt;ref&gt;K.

To tackle the desperate economic situation, in 1695 the Scottish Parliament passed Acts allowing the consolidation of [[run rig]]s and the division of common land which drove the [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution|agricultural improvements]] of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=Bowie2012p314&gt;K.

Other changes included the creation of the [[Bank of Scotland]], while the [[Company of Scotland|Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies]] received a charter to raise capital through public subscription.&lt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchison|first1=Rosalind|title=A History of Scotland|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415278805|pages=301-2|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Company invested in the [[Darién scheme]], an ambitious plan funded almost entirely by Scottish investors to build a colony on the [[Isthmus of Panama]] for trade with East Asia.&lt;ref name=Richards2004p79&gt;E.

[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;[[William Shakespeare]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Chandos portrait]], held in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;]]

The '''sexuality of William Shakespeare''' has been the subject of recurring debate. It is known from public records that he married [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]] and that they had three children; scholars have analysed their relationship through these documents, and particularly through the bequests to her in [[Shakespeare]]'s will. Some have speculated Shakespeare had affairs with other women, based on contemporaries' written anecdotes of such affairs and sometimes on the "[[Dark Lady (Shakespeare)|Dark Lady]]" figure in [[Shakespeare's sonnets|his sonnets]]. Some scholars have argued he was bisexual, based on analysis of the sonnets: many, including [[Sonnet 18]] "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day", are love poems addressed to a man, the "Fair Youth", and contain puns relating to homosexuality.

==Marriage==
At the age of 18, Shakespeare married the 26-year-old [[Anne Hathaway (wife of Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]]. The [[consistory court]] of the [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester|Diocese of Worcester]] issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. Two of Hathaway's neighbours posted [[surety bond|bonds]] the next day as [[surety]] that there were no impediments to the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schoenbaum|first=Samuel|authorlink=Samuel Schoenbaum|title=William Shakespeare : a compact documentary life |publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1977|pages=77–78|isbn=0-19-812575-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple may have arranged the ceremony in some haste, since the Worcester [[chancellor]] allowed the [[Banns of marriage|marriage banns]] to be read once instead of the usual three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Wood (historian)|title=In Search of Shakespeare|publisher=BBC Worldwide|location=London|year=2003|page=84|isbn=0-563-53477-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum (1977:78–79)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt, S., ''Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2004, pp. 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Hathaway's pregnancy could have been the reason for this. Six months after the marriage, she gave birth to a daughter,  [[Susanna Hall|Susanna]].&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum (1977:93)&lt;/ref&gt; Twins, son [[Hamnet Shakespeare|Hamnet]] and daughter [[Judith Quiney|Judith]], followed almost two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum (1977:94)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Greenblatt]] argues that Shakespeare probably initially loved Hathaway, supporting this by referring to the theory that a passage in one of his sonnets ([[Sonnet 145]]) plays off Anne Hathaway's name, saying she saved his life (writing "I hate from hate away she threw/And saved my life, saying 'not you.'").&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt (2004: 143)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, after only three years of marriage Shakespeare left his family and moved to London. Greenblatt suggests that this may imply that he felt trapped by Hathaway.&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt (2004:143)&lt;/ref&gt; Other evidence to support this belief is that he and Anne were buried in separate (but adjoining) graves and, as has often been noted, Shakespeare's will makes no specific bequest to his wife aside from "the second best bed with the furniture". This may seem like a slight, but many historians contend that the second best bed was typically the marital bed, while the best bed was reserved for guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ackroyd|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Ackroyd|title=Shakespeare the Biography|publisher=Chatto and Windus|location=London|year=2005|page=484|isbn=1-85619-726-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem "[[Anne Hathaway (poem)|Anne Hathaway]]" by [[Carol Ann Duffy]] endorses this view of the second best bed, having Anne say: "The bed we loved in was a spinning world of forests, castles, torchlight, clifftops, seas where we would dive for pearls." On the other hand, "In the other bed, the best, our guests dozed on, dribbling their prose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stpetershigh.org.uk/DEPARTMENTS/ENGLISH_DEPT/PRUSH/KS5_Resources/Year13A2Resources/Anne_Hathaway_Duffy.html |title='Anne Hathaway'|author=Duffy, Carol Ann |publisher=Stpetershigh.org.uk |date= |accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bed missing from an inventory of Anne's brother's possessions (removed in contravention of their father's will) allows the explanation that the item was an heirloom from the Hathaway family, that had to be returned.&lt;ref name=wood338&gt;Wood (2003:338)&lt;/ref&gt; The law at the time also stated that the widow of a man was automatically entitled to a third of his estate, so Shakespeare did not need to mention specific bequests in the will.&lt;ref name=wood338&gt;Wood (2003:338)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible affairs with women ==

While in London, Shakespeare may have had affairs with different women. One anecdote along these lines is provided by a lawyer named [[John Manningham]], who wrote in his diary that Shakespeare had a brief affair with a woman during a performance of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]].''&lt;ref&gt;[[John Manningham|Manningham, J.]], ''Diary of John Manningham, of the Middle Temple, and of Bradbourne, Kent, barrister-at-law, 1602–1603'', Westminster, Printed by J. B. Nichols and Sons, 1868.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Upon a time when Burbage played Richard the Third there was a citizen grew so far in liking with him, that before she went from the play she appointed him to come that night unto her by the name of Richard the Third. Shakespeare, overhearing their conclusion, went before, was entertained and at his game ere Burbage came. Then, message being brought that Richard the Third was at the door, Shakespeare caused return to be made that William the Conqueror was before Richard the Third.&lt;ref name="kd-j"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duncan-Jones|first=Katherine|title=Ungentle Shakespeare: Scenes from his life|publisher=[[Arden Shakespeare]]|location=London|year=2001|pages=132–133|isbn=1-903436-26-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Burbage referred to is [[Richard Burbage]], the star of Shakespeare's company, who is known to have played the title role in ''Richard III''. While this is one of the few surviving contemporary anecdotes about Shakespeare—it was made in March 1602, a month after Manningham had seen the play&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Somogyi|first=Nick|title=The tragedy of Richard the Third|series=The Shakespeare Folios|year=2002|publisher=Nick Hern Books|location=London|isbn=1-85459-646-2|page=xxix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarkar|first=Rabindra|title=A Topical Survey of English Literature|year=1991|publisher=Atlantic|location=New Delhi, India|page=73|oclc=221146942}}&lt;/ref&gt;—some scholars are sceptical of its validity.&lt;ref&gt;Berryman, J., ''Berryman's Shakespeare'', Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2001, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the anecdote suggests that at least one of Shakespeare's contemporaries (Manningham) believed that Shakespeare was attracted to women, even if he was not 'averse to an occasional infidelity to his marriage vows'.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;[http://search.eb.com/shakespeare/article-252446 Shakespeare, William, 'Shakespeare the man, Life, Sexuality'] Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Shakespeare, accessed 4 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, its significance has been developed to affording Shakespeare a preference for "promiscuous women of little beauty and no breeding" in his honest acknowledgement that well-born women are beyond his reach.&lt;ref name="kd-j" /&gt;

A less certain reference to an affair is a passage in the poem ''[[Willobie His Avisa]]'', by [[Henry Willobie]], which refers to Shakespeare's ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'' in the line "Shake-speare paints poor Lucrece' rape". Later in the poem there is a section in which "H.W." (Henry Willobie) and "W.S." discuss Willobie's love for "Avisa" in a verse conversation. This is introduced with a short explanatory passage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;W.S., who not long before had tried the courtesy of the like passion, and was now newly recovered ... he [Willobie] determined to see whether it would sort to a happier end for this new actor, than it did for the old player.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fact that W.S. is referred to as a "player", and is mentioned after a complimentary comment on Shakespeare's poetry has led several scholars to conclude that Willobie is describing a conversation with Shakespeare about love affairs. "W.S." goes on to give Willobie advice about how to win over women.&lt;ref&gt;Park Honan, ''Shakespeare: A Life'', Oxford University Press, New York, 1999, p.359.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other possible evidence of other affairs are that twenty-six of Shakespeare's ''Sonnets'' are love poems addressed to a married woman (the so-called '[[The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]]').

Shakespeare's sonnets are cited as evidence of his bisexuality. The poems were initially published, perhaps without his approval, in 1609.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bate|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Bate|title=Soul of the Age|publisher=Viking|location=London|year=2008|pages=220–221|chapter=The perplexities of love|isbn=978-0-670-91482-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred twenty-six of them appear to be love poems addressed to a young man known as the '[[Fair Lord]]' or 'Fair Youth'; this is often assumed to be the same person as the 'Mr W.H.' to whom the sonnets are dedicated.&lt;ref name=ss179-181/&gt; The identity of this figure (if he is indeed based on a real person) is unclear; the most popular candidates are Shakespeare's patrons, [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]], both of whom were considered handsome in their youth.&lt;ref&gt;Recent summaries of the debate over Mr W.H.'s identity include Colin Burrows, ed. ''The Complete Sonnets and Poems'' (Oxford UP, 2002), pp. 98–103; Katherine Duncan Jones, ed. ''Shakespeare's Sonnets'' (Arden Shakespeare, 1997), pp. 52–69. For Wilde's story, see ''[[The Portrait of Mr. W. H.]]'' (1889)&lt;/ref&gt;

The only explicit references to sexual acts or physical lust occur in the Dark Lady sonnets, which unambiguously state that the poet and the Lady are lovers. Nevertheless, there are numerous passages in the sonnets addressed to the Fair Lord that have been read as expressing desire for a younger man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rictornorton.co.uk/shakespe.htm Enter Willie Hughes as Juliet Or, Shakespeare's Sonnets Revisited] by Rictor Norton, accessed 23 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sonnet 13]], he is called "dear my love", and [[Sonnet 15]] announces that the poet is at "war with Time for love of you." [[Sonnet 18]] asks "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? / Thou art more lovely and more temperate", and in [[Sonnet 20]] the narrator calls the younger man the "master-mistress of my passion". The poems refer to sleepless nights, anguish and jealousy caused by the youth. In addition, there is considerable emphasis on the young man's beauty: in Sonnet 20, the narrator theorises that the youth was originally a woman with whom [[Mother Nature]] had fallen in love and, to resolve the dilemma of lesbianism, added a penis ("pricked thee out for women's pleasure"), an addition the narrator describes as "to my purpose nothing". The line can be read literally as a denial of sexual interest. However, given the homoerotic tone of the rest of the sonnet, it could also be meant to appear disingenuous,&lt;ref&gt;Kerrigan, John ''Shakespeare's Poems'' in ''The Cambridge Companion To Shakespeare'', Ed. de Grazia, Margareta and Wells, Stanley, Cambridge University Press 2001. p75&lt;/ref&gt; mimicking the common sentiment of would-be seducers: 'it's ''you'' I want, not your body’. In Sonnet 20, the narrator tells the youth to sleep with women, but to love only him: "mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure".

In some sonnets addressed to the youth, such as [[Sonnet 52]], the erotic [[pun]]ning is particularly intense: "So is the time that keeps you as my chest, Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide, To make some special instant special blest, By new unfolding his imprisoned pride." In Elizabethan bawdy, 'pride' is a euphemism for penis, especially an erect one.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Eric ''Shakespeare’s Bawdy'', Routledge p217&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have countered that these passages could be referring to intense [[platonic love|platonic]] [[friendship]], rather than sexual love. In the preface to his 1961 Pelican edition, (at which time, in Britain, proven male homosexuality still carried a prison sentence, dismissal from the professions and huge public stigma), Douglas Bush writes, &lt;blockquote&gt;Since modern readers are unused to such ardor in masculine friendship and are likely to leap at the notion of homosexuality (a notion sufficiently refuted by the sonnets themselves), we may remember that [[romantic friendship|such an ideal]], often exalted above the love of women, could exist in real life, from [[Montaigne]] to [[Sir Thomas Browne]], and was conspicuous in [[Renaissance literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Pequigney, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Richard Dutton writes that the Shakespearean scholar [[A. L. Rowse]] never accepted that the Bard was homosexual to any extent at all, writing that "Shakespeare’s interest in the youth is not at all sexual". Dutton comments:&lt;blockquote&gt;Rowse’s conviction on this point remained unshaken to his death, which is odd, not least because he himself was widely understood to be homosexual and wrote openly about writers like [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] and [[Oscar Wilde|Wilde]]. But Shakespeare for him was always unimpeachably heterosexual.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PV0_ZkkHA_gC&amp;dq=companion+shakes+sonnets&amp;q=extreme+suseptibility#v=snippet&amp;q=extreme%20suseptibility&amp;f=false Dutton, R., in Schoenfeldt, M. (ed), ''A Companion to Shakespeare's Sonnets'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010, p. 124.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another explanation is that the poems are not autobiographical but fiction, another of Shakespeare's "dramatic characterization[s]", so that the narrator of the sonnets should not be presumed to be Shakespeare himself.&lt;ref name=ss179-181&gt;Schoenbaum (1977: 179–181)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bate (2008: 214)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1640, [[John Benson (publisher)|John Benson]] published a second edition of the sonnets in which he changed most of the pronouns from masculine to feminine so that readers would believe nearly all of the sonnets were addressed to the Dark Lady. Benson's modified version soon became the best-known text, and it was not until 1780 that [[Edmond Malone]] re-published the sonnets in their original forms.&lt;ref&gt;Crompton, Louis, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'', pp. 379&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of the sexual orientation of the sonnets' author was openly articulated in 1780, when [[George Steevens]], upon reading Shakespeare's description of a young man as his "master-mistress" remarked, "it is impossible to read this fulsome panegyrick, addressed to a male object, without an equal mixture of disgust and indignation".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyder Edward Rollins|Rollins, HE.]], The Sonnets, New Variorum Shakespeare, vol. 25 II, Lippincott, 1944, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Other English scholars, dismayed at the possibility that their national hero might have been a "sodomite", concurred with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s comment, around 1800, that Shakespeare's love was "pure" and in his sonnets there is "not even an allusion to that very worst of all possible vices".&lt;ref&gt;Rollins (1944), pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Browning]], writing of Wordsworth's assertion that "with this key [the Sonnets] Shakespeare unlocked his heart", famously replied in his poem ''House'', "If so, the less Shakespeare he!"&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer, J., ''Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays'', Routledge, 1999, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy continued in the 20th century. By 1944, the Variorum edition of the sonnets contained an appendix with the conflicting views of nearly forty commentators. In the year after "the law in Britain decriminalized homosexual acts between consenting males over twenty-one", the historian G. P. V. Akrigg published the first extended study of the Earl of Southampton, "who he had no doubt was the 'fair youth' of the sonnets." Akrigg wrote, "One is forced to suspect that some element of homosexuality lay at the root of the trouble . . . The love which he felt for Southampton may well have been the most intense emotion of his life."&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;

Literary theorist [[Stephen Greenblatt]], in writing about sexuality within Southampton’s world, "assumes that something went on – 'whether they only stared longingly at one another or embraced, kissed passionately, went to bed together'".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PV0_ZkkHA_gC&amp;dq=companion+shakes+sonnets&amp;q=extreme+suseptibility#v=snippet&amp;q=extreme%20suseptibility&amp;f=false Dutton, R., in Schoenfeldt, M. (ed), ''A Companion to Shakespeare's Sonnets'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010, p. 130.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Wells]] also addressed the topic in ''Looking for sex in Shakespeare'' (2004), arguing that a balance had yet to be drawn between the deniers of any possible homoerotic expression in the sonnets and more recent, liberal commentators who have "swung too far in the opposite direction" and allowed their own sensibilities to influence their understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=Stanley|authorlink=Stanley Wells|title=Looking for sex in Shakespeare|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-83284-5|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One element that complicates the question of Shakespeare's sexuality is that same-sex friendships in the Renaissance were often characterized by shows of affection (e.g., bed sharing, confessions of love) that contemporary readers associate with modern-day sexual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bray|first=Alan|title=The Friend|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-0226071817}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garrison|first1=John|title=Shakespeare and Friendship: An Intersection of Interest|journal=Literature Compass|date=2012|volume=9|issue=5|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-4113.2012.00886.x/pdf|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent notable scholarly dispute on the matter occurred in the letters pages of the ''Times Literary Supplement'' in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;"Was Shakespeare gay, and does it matter?", The Guardian, 28 November 2014[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/28/shakespeare-gay-plays-scholars-tls]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smoke-Free Multi-Unit Housing''' refers to a ban on smoking [[tobacco products]] in multiple‐unit or multi‐unit housing (MUH) complexes, which are defined as a public or private building, or portion thereof, containing two or more dwelling or other housing units including, but not limited to, a building with live/work units, apartment buildings, condominiums, senior citizen residences, nursing homes, housekeeping room/units, residential or single room occupancy hotels, and other multiple unit residential dwellings, group housing, or boarding facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smoking Prohibition Ordinance &amp; Multiple‐Unit Housing Complexes|url=https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/EHSdocs/AirQuality/SFHC19FMUHC.pdf|publisher=City and County of San Francisco|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent estimates, within the United States, roughly 80 million (1 in 4) residents live in multi-unit housing complexes and more than 1 in 3 renters are exposed to [[passive smoking|secondhand smoke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=BA|last2=Babb|first2=SD|last3=Tynan|first3=MA|last4=Gerzoff|first4=RB|title=National and state estimates of secondhand smoke infiltration among U.S. multiunit housing residents|journal=Nicotine Tob Res|date=July 2013|volume=15|issue=7|pmid=23248030|doi=10.1093/ntr/nts254|pmc=4571449|pages=1316–1321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The first smoke-free multi-unit housing ordinance in the U.S. occurred in [[Belmont, California]], due to the advocacy efforts of a group of low-income senior citizen residents who were frustrated by the drifting secondhand smoke from their neighbors.  In November 2006, the Belmont City Council voted unanimously to pursue a comprehensive ordinance that would prohibit smoking almost anywhere in the city, except single-family detached homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yates|first1=Dana|title=Belmont to be first U.S. city to ban all smoking|url=https://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/local/belmont-to-be-first-u-s-city-to-ban-all/article_d784bf68-ea8b-5ca5-88f2-39ae28674fad.html|accessdate=2 April 2018|work=The Daily Journal|date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ordinance making smoke-free all multi-unit housing, as well as many outdoor areas, was adopted in October 2007 and sparked the interest of city officials from around the nation and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making History with Smokefree Homes|url=http://www.changelabsolutions.org/making-history-smokefree-homes|publisher=ChangeLab Solutions|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers of Secondhand Smoke==
Secondhand smoke is a major cause of disease and premature death, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems in nonsmoking adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Effects of Cigarette Smoking|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Surgeon General of the United States|U.S. Surgeon General]], there is no safe level of secondhand smoke exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General|url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/secondhandsmoke/secondhandsmoke.pdf|publisher=Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=26 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at increased risk of [[Sudden Infant Death Syndrome]] (SIDS) and are more susceptible to respiratory infections, asthma, and ear infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Environmental Health|title=Environmental Tobacco Smoke: A Hazard to Children|journal=Pediatrics|date=April 1997|volume=99|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed that children who live in homes in which no one smokes inside have a 45% increase in [[cotinine]] levels if they live in multi-unit housing compared with detached homes, due to seepage through walls and shared ventilation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=KM|last2=Klein|first2=JD|last3=Blumkin|first3=AK|last4=Gottlieb|first4=M|last5=Winickoff|first5=J|title=Tobacco-Smoke Exposure in Children Who Live in Multiunit Housing|journal=Pediatrics|date=January 2011|volume=127|issue=1|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/1/85|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondhand smoke exposure in multi-unit housing is a serious health threat because secondhand smoke drifts into housing units from neighboring units, balconies, patios, and common areas. The most effective way to address this problem and protect tenants from secondhand smoke is to pass a strong policy making, at a minimum, all units and indoor common areas in a building smoke-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Homes Manual: Smoke-free Policies in Multiunit Housing|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyhomes/Healthy_Homes_Manual_WEB.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms of Tenancy==
In addition to banning smoking in multi-unit housing residences such as apartment buildings and condos, smoke-free housing laws usually change terms of tenancy for rental units, making it a lease violation to smoke in a nonsmoking unit. These lease changes are automatic for new leases and upon renewal for existing leases. Declaring secondhand smoke as a nuisance is another option for city and county governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smokefree Multi-Unit Housing in Jurisdictions with Rent Control|url=http://www.changelabsolutions.org/sites/default/files/Rent-Control_Fact_Sheet_FINAL_20130713.pdf|publisher=ChangeLab Solutions|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smoking and Rent Control==
Communities with rent control laws have differing options in passing a smoke-free multi-unit housing policy as landlords are restricted in changing terms of tenancy without the consent of the tenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adopting Smokefree Policies in Multi-Unit Housing, including Rent Controlled Properties|url=http://www.changelabsolutions.org/sites/default/files/Rent-Control-FINAL_20151016.pdf|publisher=ChangeLab Solutions|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One option is to prohibit smoking in new tenancies and even some existing tenancies. In May 2014, the City of Berkeley was the first rent control city in California to adopt a smoke-free multi-unit housing law with a city enforcement mechanism in place that covers all newly initiated leases while encouraging those with existing leases to sign a new non-smoking lease addendum on a voluntarily basis. With this law, all residents of multi-unit housing including condos and rent-controlled units are covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berkeley Municipal Code 12.70.035: Smoking prohibited in multi-unit residences|url=http://www.codepublishing.com/CA/Berkeley/html/Berkeley12/Berkeley1270/Berkeley1270035.html#12.70.035|publisher=City of Berkeley|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Municipalities with Laws Addressing Multi-Unit Housing ==
After Belmont passed its smoke-free multi-unit housing policy, other cities began to follow suit. As of April 2018, 40 jurisdictions in California have enacted municipal laws at the city or county level that prohibit smoking in 100% of private units of all specified types of multi-unit housing. These laws typically apply to both privately-owned and publicly-owned multi-unit buildings. Such laws apply to all existing and future buildings, and do not permit current residents to continue smoking in the building (that is, no “grandfathering” clause). This includes: Alameda, Albany, Belmont, Belvedere, Berkeley, Brisbane, Burlingame, Compton, Cotati, Culver City, Daly City, El Cerrito, El Monte, Foster City, Huntington Park, Los Gatos, Manhattan Beach, Mill Valley, Novato, Palo Alto, Pasadena, Petaluma, Richmond, San Anselmo, San Bruno, San Mateo city, San Mateo County, San Rafael, Santa Clara County, Santa Rosa, Saratoga, Sebastopol, Sonoma city, Sonoma County, South San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Tiburon, Union City, Walnut Creek, and Windsor.

In addition, 24 jurisdictions in California have municipal laws at the city or county level that do not prohibit smoking in all units of all multi-unit residential buildings in the community, but restrict smoking in private units of some specified types of multi-unit buildings. These laws typically apply to both privately-owned and publicly-owned multi-unit housing. This includes: Baldwin Park, Beverly Hills, Burbank, Calabasas, Contra Costa County, Corte Madera, Dublin, Fairfax, Glendale, Lafayette, Larkspur, Loma Linda, Marin County, Moorpark, Oakley, Pinole, Pleasant Hill, Pleasanton, Redwood City, Rohnert Park, Santa Monica, Sausalito, South Pasadena, and Temecula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.no-smoke.org/goingsmokefree.php?id=519|title=Smokefree Lists, Maps, and Data - no-smoke.org|website=www.no-smoke.org|date=2017-10-03|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1918 influenza pandemic''' (January 1918&amp;nbsp;– December 1920; [[colloquialism|colloquially]] known as '''Spanish flu''') was an unusually deadly [[influenza pandemic]], the first of the two [[pandemics]] involving [[influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1 influenza virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pasteur.fr/infosci/conf/CRC/Grippe_CRC.ppt |title=La Grippe Espagnole de 1918 |format=Powerpoint |language=fr |publisher=[[Institut Pasteur]] |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117020243/http://www.pasteur.fr/infosci/conf/CRC/Grippe_CRC.ppt |archive-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It infected 500&amp;nbsp;million people around the world,{{sfn|Taubenberger|Morens|2006}} including people on remote Pacific islands and in the [[Arctic]], and resulted in the deaths of 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;million (three to five percent of the world's population),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Historical Estimates of World Population|url=https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/worldpop/table_history.php|access-date=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in [[human history]].{{sfn|Patterson|Pyle|1991}}{{sfn|Billings|1997}}{{sfn|Johnson|Mueller|2002}}

Infectious disease already limited [[life expectancy]] in the early 20th century. But in the first year of the pandemic, life expectancy in the United States dropped by about 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flu.gov/pandemic/history/1918/life_in_1918/health/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026180557/http://www.flu.gov/pandemic/history/1918/life_in_1918/health/index.html|archive-date=2016-10-26|title=The Nation's Health|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services]]|website=www.flu.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/life-expectancy/|title=Life Expectancy|website=[[Our World in Data]]|access-date=2016-03-31|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331014445/http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/life-expectancy/|archive-date=31 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918/figure2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608114504/http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918/figure2.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-06-08 |title=Life expectancy in the USA, 1900–98 |website=demog.berkeley.edu |access-date=2016-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill juvenile, elderly, or already weakened patients; in contrast, the 1918 pandemic predominantly killed previously healthy young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/influenza-epidemic/|title=The Influenza Epidemic of 1918|date=|website=Archives.gov|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists offer several possible explanations for the high mortality rate of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Some research suggests that the specific variant of the [[virus]] had an unusually aggressive nature. One group of researchers recovered the virus from the bodies of frozen victims, and found that [[transfection]] in animals caused a rapidly progressive [[respiratory failure]] and death through a [[cytokine storm]] (overreaction of the body's [[immune system]]). It was postulated that the strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.{{sfn|Barry|2004}}

== History ==

=== Hypotheses about source ===
Historian [[Alfred W. Crosby]] recorded that the flu originated in the U.S. state of [[Kansas]],{{sfn|Crosby|2003}} and popular writer [[John M. Barry|John Barry]] echoed Crosby in describing [[Haskell County, Kansas|Haskell County]], as the point of origin.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} But already in late 1917, there had been a first wave of epidemic in at least 14 US military camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the US Army infected the World with Spanish Flu|url=http://limpia.centroeu.com/how-the-us-army-infected-the-world-with-spanish-flu/|work=Limpia por dentro|access-date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigative work in 1999 by a British team, led by [[virologist]] [[John Oxford]]&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite web |title=EU Research Profile on Dr. John Oxford |url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/profiles/index_en.cfm?p=1_oxford |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5ghdULukN?url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/profiles/index_en.cfm?p=1_oxford |archive-date=12 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |access-date=9 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] and the [[Royal London Hospital]], identified the major troop staging and hospital camp in [[Étaples]], France, as being the center of the Spanish flu. In late 1917, military pathologists reported the onset of a new disease with high mortality that they later recognized as the flu. The overcrowded camp and hospital&amp;nbsp;— which treated thousands of victims of chemical attacks and other casualties of war&amp;nbsp;— was an ideal site for the spreading of a respiratory virus; 100,000 soldiers were in transit every day. It also was home to a live piggery, and poultry were regularly brought in for food supplies from surrounding villages. Oxford and his team postulated that a significant precursor virus, harbored in birds, mutated so it could migrate to pigs that were kept near the front.&lt;ref name="Etaples"&gt;Connor, Steve, [https://archive.is/20090808003837/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/flu-epidemic-traced-to-great-war-transit-camp-728112.html "Flu epidemic traced to Great War transit camp"], ''The Guardian'' (UK), Saturday, 8 January 2000.

Earlier hypotheses of the epidemic's origin have varied. Some hypothesized the flu originated in East Asia, a common area for transmission of disease from animals to humans because of dense living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3455873.stm 1918 killer flu secrets revealed]. ''BBC News.'' 5 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Claude Hannoun, the leading expert on the 1918 flu for the [[Pasteur Institute]], asserted the former virus was likely to have come from China, mutating in the United States near [[Boston]] and spreading to [[Brest, France]], Europe's battlefields, Europe, and the world via Allied soldiers and sailors as the main spreaders.&lt;ref&gt;Hannoun, Claude, "La Grippe", Ed Techniques EMC (Encyclopédie Médico-Chirurgicale), Maladies infectieuses, 8-069-A-10, 1993. Documents de la Conférence de l'Institut Pasteur : ''La Grippe Espagnole de 1918''.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered several other hypotheses of origin, such as Spain, [[Kansas]] (United States), and Brest, as being possible, but not likely.

Political scientist [[Andrew Price-Smith]] published data from the [[Austrian archives]] suggesting the influenza had earlier origins, beginning in Austria in early 1917.{{sfn|Price-Smith|2008}}

In 2014, historian Mark Humphries of the [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland|St. John's]] stated that newly unearthed records confirmed that one of the side stories of the war, the mobilization of 96,000 [[Chinese Labour Corps|Chinese laborers]] to work behind the British and French lines on World War I's western front, might have been the source of the pandemic. In the report, Humphries found archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the "Spanish" flu.{{sfn|Humphries|2014}}&lt;ref name="Vergano"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140123-spanish-flu-1918-china-origins-pandemic-science-health/ | title=1918 Flu Pandemic That Killed 50 Million Originated in China, Historians Say | work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] | date=January 24, 2014 | access-date=November 4, 2016 | author=Vergano, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report published in 2016 in the Journal of the [[Chinese Medical Association]] found no evidence that the 1918 virus was imported to Europe via Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers.

=== Spread ===
When an infected person sneezes or coughs, more than half a million virus particles can be spread to those close by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sherman|first1=Irwin W. | name-list-format = vanc | authorlink = Irwin Sherman|title=Twelve diseases that changed our world|date=2007|publisher=ASM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-55581-466-3|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The close quarters and massive troop movements of [[World War I]] hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation; the war may also have increased the lethality of the virus. Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility.{{sfn|Ewald|1994}}

A large factor in the worldwide occurrence of this flu was increased travel. Modern transportation systems made it easier for soldiers, sailors, and civilian travelers to spread the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

In the United States, the disease was first observed in [[Haskell County, Kansas]], in January 1918, prompting local doctor Loring Miner to warn the U.S. Public Health Service's academic journal. On 4 March 1918, company cook Albert Gitchell reported sick at [[Fort Riley]], an American military facility that at the time was training American troops during World War I, making him the first recorded victim of the flu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barry JM | title = The site of origin of the 1918 influenza pandemic and its public health implications | journal = Journal of Translational Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 3 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14733617 | pmc = 340389 | doi = 10.1186/1479-5876-2-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bynum |first=Bill | name-list-format = vanc |date=March 14, 2009 |title=Stories of an influenza pandemic |url=http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(09)60530-4.pdf |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=373 |issue=9667 |pages=885–886 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)60530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, 522 men at the camp had reported sick.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080521071645/http://www.avian-bird-flu.info/spanishfluepidemic1918.html Avian Bird Flu.

In August 1918, a more virulent strain appeared simultaneously in [[Brest, France]]; in [[Freetown|Freetown, Sierra Leone]]; and in the U.S. in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]. The Spanish flu also spread through Ireland, carried there by returning Irish soldiers. The [[Allies of World War I]] came to call it the Spanish flu, primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain was not involved in the war and had not imposed wartime [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100127100727/http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/world/spanish%20flu%20facts/111285 Channel 4&amp;nbsp;– News&amp;nbsp;– Spanish flu facts].&lt;/ref&gt;

The virus also killed people directly, by causing massive [[bleeding|hemorrhages]] and [[edema]] in the lung.{{sfn|Taubenberger|Reid|Janczewski|Fanning|2001| pp=1829–1839}}

The unusually severe disease killed up to 20% of those infected, as opposed to the usual flu epidemic [[mortality rate]] of 0.1%.{{sfn|Taubenberger|Morens|2006}}{{sfn|Knobler|2005}}

=== Patterns of fatality ===
The pandemic mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40&amp;nbsp;years old. In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}} This is unusual, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as [[infant]]s (under age two), the very old (over age 70), and the [[immunocompromise]]d. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the [[1889–1890 flu pandemic]], known as the Russian flu.&lt;ref name=hansen&gt;Hanssen, Olav. Undersøkelser over influenzaens optræden specielt i Bergen 1918–1922. Bg. 1923. 66 s. ill. (Haukeland sykehus. Med.avd.Arb. 2) (Klaus Hanssens fond. Skr. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;
According to historian John M. Barry, the most vulnerable of all&amp;nbsp;– "those most likely, of the most likely", to die&amp;nbsp;– were pregnant women. He reported that in thirteen studies of hospitalized women in the pandemic, the death rate ranged from 23% to 71%.&lt;ref name="PayneBayatibojakhi2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Payne MS, Bayatibojakhi S | title = Exploring preterm birth as a polymicrobial disease: an overview of the uterine microbiome | journal = Frontiers in Immunology | volume = 5 | pages = 595 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25505898 | pmc = 4245917 | doi = 10.3389/fimmu.2014.00595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Of the pregnant women who survived childbirth, over one-quarter (26%) lost the child.{{sfn|Barry| 2004| p= 239 }}

Another oddity was that the outbreak was widespread in the summer and autumn (in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]); influenza is usually worse in winter.&lt;ref&gt;Key Facts about Swine Influenza [https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/keyfacts_pigs.htm] accessed 22:45 GMT-6 30 April 2009.

Modern analysis has shown the virus to be particularly deadly because it triggers a [[cytokine storm]], which ravages the stronger immune system of young adults.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}}

In fast-progressing cases, mortality was primarily from [[pneumonia]], by virus-induced pulmonary [[consolidation (medicine)|consolidation]]. Slower-progressing cases featured secondary bacterial pneumonias, and there may have been [[neural]] involvement that led to [[mental disorders]] in some cases. Some deaths resulted from malnourishment.

A study&amp;nbsp;– conducted by He et al.&amp;nbsp;– used a mechanistic modelling approach to study the three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. They tried to study the factors that underlie variability in temporal patterns, and the patterns of mortality and morbidity. Their analysis suggests that temporal variations in transmission rate provide the best explanation, and the variation in transmission required to generate these three waves is within biologically plausible values.{{sfn|He|Dushoff|Day|Ma|2011}}

Another study by He et al. used a simple epidemic model, to incorporate three factors, including school opening and closing, temperature changes over the course of the outbreak, and human behavioral changes in response to the outbreak, to infer the cause of the three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Their modelling results showed that all three factors are important but human behavioral responses showed the largest effects.{{sfn|He|Dushoff|Day|Ma|2013}}

=== Deadly second wave ===
[[File:USCampHospital45InfluenzaWard.jpg|thumb|[[American Expeditionary Force]] victims of the Spanish flu at U.S. Army Camp Hospital no. 45 in [[Aix-les-Bains]], France, in 1918]]
The second wave of the 1918 pandemic was much deadlier than the first. The first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics; those most at risk were the sick and elderly, while younger, healthier people recovered easily. But by  August, when the second wave began in France, Sierra Leone, and the United States,&lt;ref&gt;UK Parliament&amp;nbsp;– http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldsctech/88/88.pdf. Accessed 2009-05-06.

As the [[List of American Experience episodes#Season 10 (1997–98)|PBS ''American Experience'': Influenza 1918 episode]] says, October 1918 was the deadliest month of the whole pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

This increased severity has been attributed to the circumstances of the First World War.{{sfn|Gladwell|1997|p=55}} In civilian life, natural selection favors a mild strain. Those who get very ill stay home, and those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus. The second wave began and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics, health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).{{sfn|Gladwell|1997|p=63}}

The fact that most of those who recovered from first-wave infections had become [[Immunity (medical)|immune]] showed that it must have been the same strain of flu. This was most dramatically illustrated in [[Copenhagen]], which escaped with a combined mortality rate of just 0.29% (0.02% in the first wave and 0.27% in the second wave) because of exposure to the less-lethal first wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fogarty International Center|url=http://www.fic.nih.gov/News/GlobalHealthMatters/Pages/Flu-1918.aspx|title=Summer Flu Outbreak of 1918 May Have Provided Partial Protection Against Lethal Fall Pandemic |publisher=Fic.nih.gov|date=|access-date=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of the population, the second wave was far more deadly; the most vulnerable people were those like the soldiers in the trenches&amp;nbsp;– young previously healthy adults.{{sfn|Gladwell|1997|p=56}}

=== Devastated communities ===
[[File:Spanish flu death chart.png|thumb|A chart of deaths in major cities, showing a peak in October and November 1918|alt=|300x300px]]
[[File:Coromandel_Hospital_Board.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|295x295px|Coromandel Hospital Board ([[New Zealand]]) advice to influenza sufferers (1918)]]
Even in areas where mortality was low, so many adults were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that health-care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by [[steam shovel]] and bodies buried without coffins in many places.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2004/11/01/8189572/index.htm Viruses of Mass Destruction]",  ''Fortune'', 01 November 2004; accessed 30 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Pacific island]] territories were particularly hard-hit. The pandemic reached them from New Zealand, which was too slow to implement measures to prevent [[SS Talune|ships carrying the flu]] from leaving its ports. From New Zealand, the flu reached [[Tonga]] (killing 8% of the population), [[Nauru]] (16%) and [[Fiji]] (5%, 9,000 people).{{sfn|Denoon|2004}}

Worst affected was [[Western Samoa]], formerly [[German Samoa]], which had been [[Occupation of German Samoa|occupied by New Zealand]] in 1914. 90% of the population was infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of children died. By contrast, [[Governor of American Samoa|Governor]] [[John Martin Poyer]] prevented the flu from reaching [[American Samoa]] by imposing a blockade.{{sfn|Denoon|2004}} The disease spread fastest through the higher social classes among the indigenous peoples, because of the custom of gathering oral tradition from chiefs on their deathbeds; many community elders were infected through this process.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wishart|first=Skye|date=July–August 2018|title=How the 1918 flu spread|url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/how-the-1918-flu-spread/|journal=New Zealand Geographic|volume=|issue=152|pages=23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand, 8,573 deaths were attributed to the 1918 pandemic influenza, resulting in a total population fatality rate of 0.74%.{{sfn|Rice|2005|p=221}} [[Māori people|Māori]] were 10 times as likely to die as [[pākehā]] (Europeans), because of their poorer and more crowded housing, and rural population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

In Ireland, the Spanish Flu accounted for 10% of the total deaths in 1918.

Data analysis revealed 6,520 recorded deaths in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah-Chatham County, Georgia]] (population = 83,252) for the three-year period from January 1, 1917, to December 31, 1919. Of these deaths, influenza was specifically listed as the cause of death in 316 cases, representing 4.85 percent of all causes of death for the total time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plaspohl|first1=Sata S.|last2=Dixon|first2=Betty T.|last3=Owen|first3=Nyssa | name-list-format = vanc |title="The Effect of the 1918 Spanish Influenza Pandemic on Mortality Rates in Savannah, Georgia|journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=2016|volume=100|issue=3|page=332|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=119493974&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- What's the point of having this relatively small record in an article about a worldwide epidemic? --&gt;

=== Less-affected areas ===
In Japan, 257,363 deaths were attributed to influenza by July 1919, giving an estimated 0.425% mortality rate, much lower than nearly all other Asian countries for which data are available. The Japanese government severely restricted sea travel to and from the home islands when the pandemic struck.

In Australia, nearly 12,000 perished.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040917020632/http://www.ballaratgenealogy.org.au/digby/1919flu.htm Anne Grant, History House, Portland.

By the end of the pandemic, the isolated island of [[Marajó]], in Brazil's Amazon River Delta had not reported an outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Jeffrey, ed. Pandemic influenza: emergency planning and community preparedness. Boca Raton : CRC Press, 2009. P. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Helena]] also reported no deaths.&lt;ref&gt;"Colonial Annual Report", 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aspirin poisoning ===
In a 2009 paper published in the journal ''[[Clinical Infectious Diseases]]'', Karen Starko proposed that [[aspirin poisoning]] contributed substantially to the fatalities. She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the post mortem reports still available, and also the timing of the big "death spike" in October 1918. This occurred shortly after the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army]] and the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' both recommended very large doses of 8 to 31 grams of aspirin per day as part of treatment. These levels will produce hyperventilation in 33% of patients, as well as lung edema in 3% of patients.{{sfn|Starko|2009}} Starko also notes that many early deaths showed "wet," sometimes hemorrhagic lungs, whereas late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia. She suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a "[[perfect storm]]" of events: [[Bayer]]'s patent on aspirin expired, so many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the Spanish flu; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}

As an explanation for the universally high mortality rate, this hypothesis was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010 by Andrew Noymer and Daisy Carreon of the [[University of California, Irvine]], and Niall Johnson of the [[Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care]]. They questioned the universal applicability of the aspirin theory, given the high mortality rate in countries such as India, where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time compared to the rate where aspirin was plentiful.{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} They concluded that "the [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] [aspirin] poisoning hypothesis [was] difficult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918–1919 inﬂuenza pandemic".{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} In response, Starko said there was [[anecdotal evidence]] of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.{{sfn|Starko|2010}}

=== End of the pandemic ===
After the lethal second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly&amp;nbsp;– almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave.{{sfn|Barry| 2004 }} In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 people died in the week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus; but John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}}

Another theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} (see also [[Spanish flu#Deadly second wave|"Deadly Second Wave"]], above).

=== Long-term effects ===
A 2006 study in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' found that "cohorts in utero during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher transfer payments compared with other birth cohorts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Almond|first=Douglas|date=2006-08-01|title=Is the 1918 Influenza Pandemic Over?

{{see also|List of Spanish flu cases}}
[[File:1918 flu in Oakland.jpg|thumb|[[American Red Cross]] nurses tend to flu patients in temporary wards set up inside [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] Municipal Auditorium, 1918.]]

Academic [[Andrew Price-Smith]] has made the argument that the virus helped tip the balance of power in the later days of the war towards the Allied cause. He provides data that the viral waves hit the Central Powers before they hit the Allied powers, and that both [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]] in Germany and Austria were considerably higher than in Britain and France.{{sfn|Price-Smith|2008}}

In the United States, Britain and other countries, despite the relatively high morbidity and mortality rates that resulted from the epidemic in 1918–1919, the Spanish flu began to fade from public awareness over the decades until the arrival of news about [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] and other pandemics in the 1990s and 2000s.{{sfn|Honigsbaum|2008}} This has led some historians to label the Spanish flu a "forgotten pandemic".{{sfn|Crosby|2003}}

Various theories of why the Spanish flu was "forgotten" include the rapid pace of the pandemic, which killed most of its victims in the United States, for example, within a period of less than nine months, resulting in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: [[typhoid]], [[yellow fever]], [[diphtheria]], and [[cholera]] all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public.{{sfn|Morrissey|1986}} In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.{{sfn|Benedict|Braithwaite|2000|p=38}}

In addition, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War.{{sfn|Crosby| 2003| pp=320–322}} Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults. The deaths caused by the flu may have been overlooked due to the large numbers of deaths of young men in the war or as a result of injuries. When people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was extremely high, the flu may not have had a great, separate, psychological impact, or may have seemed a mere extension of the war's tragedies.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}}

The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a certain area for a month before leaving, while the war, which most had initially expected to end quickly, had lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck. This left little time for the disease to have a significant impact on the economy.

Regarding global economic effects, many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the health care industry reported profit gains.{{sfn|Garrett|2007}}

Historian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was due in part to the failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.&lt;ref&gt;Lindley, Robin, [http://hnn.us/article/146655 The Forgotten American Pandemic: Historian Dr. Nancy K. Bristow on the Influenza Epidemic of 1918 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, sources from the period explicitly linked the Spanish flu to the cultural figure of [[Don Juan]]. The nickname for the flu, the "Naples Soldier", was adopted from Federico Romero and [[Guillermo Fernández Shaw]]'s operetta, ''The Song of Forgetting'' (''La canción del olvido''), the protagonist of which is a stock Don Juan type. [[Federico Romero]], one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, ''Naples Soldier'', was as catchy as the flu. Davis has argued the Spanish flu–Don Juan connection served a cognitive function, allowing Spaniards to make sense of their epidemic experience by interpreting it through a familiar template, namely the Don Juan story.{{sfn|Davis| 2013| pp= 103–136}}

The origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial. One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]], in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/influenza.html|title=Open Collections Program: Contagion, Spanish Influenza in North America, 1918–191|publisher=|access-date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans.&lt;ref name=influenzareport&gt;Sometimes a virus contains both avian-adapted genes and human-adapted genes. Both the [[H2N2]] and [[H3N2]] pandemic strains contained avian flu virus [[RNA]] segments. "While the pandemic human influenza viruses of 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) clearly arose through reassortment between human and avian viruses, the influenza virus causing the 'Spanish flu' in 1918 appears to be entirely derived from an avian source (Belshe 2005)." (from [http://www.influenzareport.com/ir/ai.htm Chapter Two: Avian Influenza by Timm C. Harder and Ortrud Werner], a free on-line book called ''Influenza Report 2006'')&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Taubenberger|Reid|Louren|Wang|2005}}

Others have disagreed,{{sfn|Antonovics|Hood|Baker|2006}} and more recent research has suggested the strain may have originated in a nonhuman, mammalian species.{{sfn|Vana|Westover|2008}} An estimated date for its appearance in mammalian hosts has been put at the period 1882–1913.{{sfn|dos Reis|Hay|Goldstein|2009}} This ancestor virus diverged about 1913–1915 into two [[clade]]s (or biological groups), which gave rise to the classical swine and human [[H1N1]] influenza lineages. The last common ancestor of human strains dates to between February 1917 and April 1918. Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans, they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.

An effort to recreate the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], the [[USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service|ARS]] Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in [[New York City]]. The effort resulted in the announcement (on 5 October 2005) that the group had successfully determined the virus's genetic sequence, using historic tissue samples recovered by pathologist [[Johan Hultin]] from a female flu victim buried in the Alaskan [[permafrost]] and samples preserved from American soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/r051005.htm Center for Disease Control: Researchers Reconstruct 1918 Pandemic Influenza Virus; Effort Designed to Advance Preparedness] Retrieved on 2 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January 2007, Kobasa et al. (2007) reported that monkeys (''[[Macaca fascicularis]]'') infected with the recreated flu strain exhibited classic symptoms of the 1918 pandemic, and died from a [[cytokine storm]]{{sfn|Kobasa|et al.|2007}}—an overreaction of the [[immune system]]. This may explain why the 1918 flu had its surprising effect on younger, healthier people, as a person with a stronger immune system would potentially have a stronger overreaction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/flu-research.htm?POE=NEWISVA USA Today: Research on monkeys finds resurrected 1918 flu killed by turning the body against itself] Retrieved on 14 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 2008, the body of British politician and diplomat [[Mark Sykes|Sir Mark Sykes]] was exhumed to study the RNA of the flu virus in efforts to understand the genetic structure of modern [[H5N1]] bird flu. Sykes had been buried in 1919 in a lead coffin which scientists hoped had helped preserve the virus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/7617968.stm BBC News: Body exhumed in fight against flu] Retrieved on 16 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The coffin was found to be split because of the weight of soil over it, and the cadaver was badly decomposed. Nonetheless, samples of lung and brain tissue were taken through the split, with the coffin remaining ''in situ'' in the grave during this process.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Four]] documentary. ''In Search of Spanish Flu''&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, research by [[Yoshihiro Kawaoka]] of the [[University of Wisconsin]] linked the presence of three specific genes (termed PA, PB1, and PB2) and a nucleoprotein derived from 1918 flu samples to the ability of the flu virus to invade the lungs and cause pneumonia. The combination triggered similar symptoms in animal testing.{{sfn|Fox|2008}}

In June 2010, a team at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine reported the [[2009 flu pandemic vaccine]] provided some cross-protection against the 1918 flu pandemic strain.{{sfn|Fox|2010}}

One of the few things known for certain about the influenza in 1918 and for some years after was that it was, out of the laboratory, exclusively a disease of human beings.{{sfn|Crosby|1976|p=295}}

In 2013, the AIR Worldwide Research and Modeling Group "characterized the historic 1918 pandemic and estimated the effects of a similar pandemic occurring today using the AIR Pandemic Flu Model". In the model, "a modern day "Spanish flu" event would result in additional life insurance losses of between USD 15.3–27.8 billion in the United States alone", with 188,000–337,000 deaths in the United States.{{sfn|Madhav|2013}}

'''Staphylococcal enteritis''' is an inflammation that is usually caused by eating or drinking substances contaminated with staph enterotoxin. The toxin, not the bacterium, settles in the small intestine and causes inflammation and swelling.  This in turn can cause abdominal pain, cramping, dehydration, diarrhea and fever.&lt;ref name=vorvick&gt;{{cite web|last=Vorvick|first=L.|title=Enteritis|url=http://averaorg.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=117&amp;pid=1&amp;gid=001149|publisher=Avera Health|accessdate=15 May 2012|author2=Longstreth, G. |author3=Zieve, D |date=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' is a Gram-positive, [[facultative]] anaerobe, [[Coccus|coccal]] (round shaped) bacteria that appears in grape-like clusters that can thrive in high salt and low water activity habitats. ''S. aureus'' bacteria can live on the skin which is one of the primary modes of transmission. ''S. aureus'' can cause a range of illnesses from minor skin infections to Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning enteritis. Since humans are the primary source, cross-contamination is the most common way the [[microorganism]] is introduced into foods. Foods at high risks are those prepared in large quantities. 
Staphylococcus aureus is a true food poisoning organism. It produces a heat stable [[enterotoxin]] when allowed to grow for several hours in foods such as cream-filled baked goods, poultry meat, gravies, eggs, meat salads, puddings and vegetables. It is important to note that the toxins may be present in dangerous amounts in foods that have no signs of spoilage, such as a bad smell, any off color, odor, or textural or flavor change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disease Listing, Staphylococcal Food Poisoning, General Info CDC Bacterial, Mycotic Diseases.|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/staphylococcus_food_g.htm|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=15 May 2012|date=29 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBB - Staphylococcus aureus|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm070015.htm.|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=15 May 2012|date=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enteritis]] is the inflammation of the small intestine. It is generally caused by eating or drinking substances that are contaminated with bacteria or viruses. The bacterium and/or toxin settles in the small intestine and cause inflammation and swelling.  This in turn can cause abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, fever, and dehydration.&lt;ref name=vorvick/&gt; There are other types of enteritis, the types include: bacterial gastroenteritis, ''[[Campylobacter]]'' enteritis, ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' enteritis, [[radiation enteritis]], ''[[Salmonella]]'' enteritis and ''[[Shigella]]'' enteritis.

== Symptoms==

Common symptoms of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' food poisoning include: a rapid onset which is usually 1–6 hours, nausea, explosive vomiting for up to 24 hours, abdominal cramps/pain, headache, weakness, diarrhea and usually a subnormal body temperature. Symptoms usually start one to six hours after eating and last less than 12 hours. The duration of some cases may take two or more days to fully resolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enteritis - PubMed Health|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002134/|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|accessdate=15 May 2012|date=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathogenesis==
''S. aureus'' is an enterotoxin producer. Enterotoxins are chromosomally encoded exotoxins that are produced and secreted from several bacterial organisms. It is a heat stable toxin and is resistant to digestive [[protease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vesterlund|first=S.|title=''Staphylococcus aureus'' adheres to human intestinal mucus but can be displaced by certain lactic acid bacteria|journal=Microbiology|date=1 June 2006|volume=152|issue=6|pages=1819–1826|doi=10.1099/mic.0.28522-0|pmid=16735744|url=http://www.microbiologyresearch.org/docserver/fulltext/micro/152/6/1819.pdf?expires=1462737589&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=4E6FAD02AE809872E09E874B53D6A28C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCZVED&gt;{{cite web|title=CDC - Staphylococcal Food Poisoning - NCZVED|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/staphylococcal/#what|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=15 May 2012|date=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the ingestion of the toxin that causes the inflammation and swelling of the intestine.

== Diagnosis==

For the detection of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' food poisoning which can lead to staphylococcal enteritis a stool culture may be required. A stool culture is used to detect the presence of disease-causing bacteria (pathogenic) and help diagnose an infection of the digestive tract. In the case of staphylococcal enteritis, it is conducted to see if the stool is positive for a [[pathogenic]] bacterium.&lt;ref name=vorvick/&gt;
== Prevention ==

Staphylococcal enteritis may be avoided by using proper hygiene and sanitation with food preparation. This includes thoroughly cooking all meats. If food is to be stored longer than two hours, keep hot foods hot (over 140&amp;nbsp;°F) and cold foods cold (40&amp;nbsp;°F or under).&lt;ref name="NCZVED"/&gt; Ensure to refrigerate leftovers promptly and store cooked food in a wide, shallow container and refrigerate as soon as possible.  [[Sanitation]] is very important.  Keep kitchens and food-serving areas clean and sanitized. Finally, as most staphylococcal food poisoning are the result of food handling, hand washing is critical.  Food handlers should use hand sanitizers with alcohol or thorough hand washing with soap and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Lalla, F., &amp; Dingle, P.|year=2004|title=The efficacy of cleaning products on food industry surfaces|journal=Journal of Environmental Health|volume=67|issue=2|pages=17–21|pmid=15468512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tips for [[hand washing]]:

1. Wash hands with warm, soapy water before and after handling raw foods.
:a. First, wet your hands.
:
:b. Add soap to your hands.
:
:c. Rub both sides for at least 20 seconds.
:
:d. Rinse thoroughly.
:
:e. Air dry, or dry your hands with a clean towel or [[paper towel]].

2. Always wash your hands after using the bathroom, after changing a baby's diaper, after touching pets or other animals, and after sneezing or coughing

3. Properly dress or glove.

== Treatment and diet==
Treatment is supportive and based upon symptoms, with fluid and electrolyte replacement as the primary goal. Dehydration caused by diarrhea and vomiting is the most common complication. To prevent dehydration, it is important to take frequent sips of a rehydration drink (like water) or try to drink a cup of water or rehydration drink for each large, loose stool.

Dietary management of enteritis consists of starting with a clear liquid diet until vomiting and diarrhea end and then slowly introduce solid foods. It is also important to avoid foods that are high in fiber or are possibly difficult to digest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enteritis Diet |accessdate=9 April 2012 |url=http://www.rd411.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227:enteritis-diet&amp;catid=91:diseases-and-medical-conditions&amp;Itemid=385 |date=1 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015043707/http://rd411.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=227:enteritis-diet&amp;catid=91:diseases-and-medical-conditions&amp;Itemid=385 |archivedate=October 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martin's Best Virginia tobacco advertisement.jpg|thumb|Tobacco advertisement from the 18th century]]
Tobacco cultivation and exports formed an essential component of the American colonial economy. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], they were distinct from other cash crops in terms of agricultural demands, trade, slave labor, and plantation culture. Many influential American revolutionaries, including [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[George Washington]], owned tobacco plantations, and were financially devastated by debt to British tobacco merchants shortly before the [[American Revolution]].

==American Revolution==

American tobacco planters, including Jefferson and [[George Washington]], financed their plantations with sizeable loans from London. When tobacco prices dropped precipitously in the 1750s, many plantations struggled to remain financially solvent. Severe debt threatened to unravel colonial power structures and destroy planters’ personal reputations. At his [[Mount Vernon]] plantation, Washington saw his liabilities swell to nearly £2000 by the late 1760s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Randall, Willard Sterne]]. George Washington a Life. New York: Henry Holt &amp;, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson, on the verge of losing his own farm, aggressively espoused various conspiracy theories. Though never verified, Jefferson accused London merchants of unfairly depressing tobacco prices and forcing Virginia farmers to take on unsustainable debt loads. In 1786, he remarked:
::''“A powerful engine for this [mercantile profiting] was the giving of good prices and credit to the planter till they got him more immersed in debt than he could pay without selling lands or slaves. They then reduced the prices given for his tobacco so that…they never permitted him to clear off his debt.”''&lt;ref name="Breen"/&gt;
 
The inability to pay what one owed was not just a financial failing, but a moral one. Planters whose operations collapsed were condemned as “sorry farmers” – unable to produce good crops and inept at managing their land, slaves, and assets. Washington excused his situation thusly:
::''“Mischance rather than Misconduct hath been the cause of [my debt]…It is but an irksome thing to a free mind to be always hampered in Debt.”''&lt;ref&gt;Haworth, Paul Leland. George Washington: Farmer Being an Account of His Home Life and Agricultural Activities,. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill Company, 1915. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In conjunction with a global financial crisis and growing animosity toward British rule, tobacco interests helped unite disparate colonial players and produced some of the most vocal revolutionaries behind the call for American independence. A spirit of rebellion arose from their claims that insurmountable debts prevented the exercise of basic human freedoms.

==Early cultivation==
[[John Rolfe]], a colonist from [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], was the first colonist to grow [[tobacco]] in America. He arrived in [[Virginia]] with tobacco seeds procured on an earlier voyage to [[Trinidad]], and in 1612 he harvested his inaugural crop for sale on the European market.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Rolfe’s tobacco operation was an instant boom for American exports.

==Chesapeake Consignment System==
As the English increasingly used tobacco products, tobacco in the American colonies became significant economic force, especially in the [[Tidewater region of Virginia|tidewater region]] surrounding the Chesapeake Bay. Vast plantations were built along the rivers of Virginia, and social/economic systems developed to grow and distribute this [[cash crop]]. In 1713, the General Assembly (under the leadership of Governor [[Alexander Spotswood]]) passed a Tobacco Act requiring the inspection of all tobacco intended for export or for use as legal tender.&lt;ref&gt; http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Spotswood_Alexander_1676-1740#start_entry &lt;/ref&gt; In 1730, the [[Virginia]] [[House of Burgesses]] standardized and improved quality of tobacco exported by establishing the [[Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730]], which required inspectors to grade tobacco at 40 specified locations. Some elements of this system included the importation and employment of slaves to grow crops. Planters filled large [[hogshead]]s with tobacco and conveyed them to inspection warehouses.

The tobacco economy in the colonies was embedded in a cycle of leaf demand, slave labor demand, and global commerce that gave rise to the [[Chesapeake Consignment System]] and [[Tobacco Lords]]. American tobacco farmers would sell their crop on [[consignment]] to merchants in [[London]], which required them to take out loans for farm expenses from London guarantors in exchange for tobacco delivery and sale.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; Further contracts were negotiated with wholesalers in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] or [[New Orleans]] to ship the tobacco to London merchants. The loan was then repaid with profits from their sales. [[Image:Triangle trade2.png|right|thumb|400px|The "Triangular Trade".]]

American planters responded to increased European demand by expanding the size and output of their plantations. The number of man-hours needed to sustain larger operations increased, which forced planters to acquire and accommodate additional slave labor. Furthermore, they had to secure larger initial loans from London, which increased pressure to produce a profitable crop and made them more financially vulnerable to natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slave labor on tobacco plantations==
[[File:1670 virginia tobacco slaves.jpg|thumb|250px|Slaves processing tobacco in 17th-century Virginia]]

=== Slave boom in the 1700s ===
The slave population in the Chesapeake increased significantly during the 18th century due to demand for cheap tobacco labor and a dwindling influx of indentured servants willing to migrate from England. In this century, it is estimated that the Chesapeake African slave population increased from 100,000 to 1 million – a majority of the enslaved workforce and about 40% of the total population.&lt;ref name="Kulikoff"&gt;Kulikoff&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves were not imported to the Chesapeake after 1775, but slave populations continued to increase through 1790 because most were forced by their masters to produce large numbers of offspring.

Before the slave boom, Chesapeake tobacco plantations were characterized by a “culture of assimilation”, where white planters worked alongside their black slaves and racial boundaries were less distinct.&lt;ref name="Kulikoff"/&gt; As slaveholding increased, intense racial contrasts emerged and all-black labor units supervised by white planters came to replace mixed-race units. Unwritten race-based [[sumptuary laws]], which would later become [[Jim Crow laws]], became common social fixtures in Northern and Southern colonies.

For the many farmers who seized opportunity in the profitable tobacco enterprise, financial and personal anxiety mounted amidst stiff competition and falling prices. Some historians believe that these anxieties were redirected onto subordinates in the field, which exacerbated already strained racial relations. Planters pushed slaves to their physical limits to ensure a superior crop. Slaves, meanwhile, realized that the quality of a crop depended on their effort and began “foot dragging”, or collectively slowing their pace in protest of the planters' extreme demands. Farmers racialized foot dragging, portraying it as an inherent personality trait of slaves. William Strickland, a wealthy colonial tobacco planter, remarked:
::''“Nothing can be conceived more inert than a slave; his unwilling labour is discovered in every step he takes; he moves not if he can avoid it; if the eyes of the overseer be off him, he sleeps…all is listless inactivity; all motion is evidently compulsory.”''&lt;ref&gt;Morgan&lt;/ref&gt;
Tensions between slaves and planters occasionally escalated enough to bring work in the field to a standstill. When this occurred, masters often punished insubordinate slaves with physical violence such as lashings and whippings until they resumed their tasks.

===Differences between the Chesapeake and Deep South===
In the Chesapeake and [[North Carolina]], tobacco constituted a major percentage of the total agricultural output. In the [[Deep South]] (mainly [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]]), [[cotton]] and [[rice]] plantations dominated. Stark diversity in the geographic and social landscapes of these two regions contributed to differences in their respective slave cultures.

The Chesapeake had few urban centers relative to the South. Instead, multiple markets were established along tributaries. This facilitated the persistence of smaller tobacco farms because the cost of moving tobacco to market was kept reasonable. In the south, all economic activity fed through a few heavily centralized markets, which favored large plantations that could bear the higher transportation costs. Differences in plantation size also owed significantly to the different demands of tobacco farming versus cotton and rice. Cotton and rice were [[cash crops]], and cultivation was geared towards maximizing volume. [[Diminishing returns]] take effect on harvest quality past a certain threshold of labor investment. Tobacco, however, was considered to be more artisanal and craft-like, with limitless opportunity to improve the yield and quality.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, p.21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the most profitable cotton and rice operations were large and factory-like, while tobacco profits hinged on skilled, careful, and efficient labor units.

Because of the diminished need for trained labor, families of slaves on cotton and rice plantations would often remain together, bought and sold as complete packages. Individual life expectancies were generally shorter, because their skill set was less refined and workers were easily replaced if killed. Cotton and rice plantation owners employed a management technique called “tasking”, in which each slave would receive around one-half acre of land to tend individually with minimal supervision. The weight of the yield from each slave’s plot was interpreted as a direct reflection of the quality of his work.&lt;ref name="digitalhistory"&gt;[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/modules/slavery/index.cfm www.digitalhistory.uh.edu] Retrieved August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, tobacco planters desired skilled male slaves, while women were mainly responsible for breeding and raising children. Family members were often estranged when women and children left to seek other work. Individual life expectancies for tobacco slaves were generally longer because their unique skills, honed over the course of many years in the field, proved indispensable to a planter’s success. Tobacco planters favored a technique called “ganging”, where groups of eight to twelve slaves worked fields simultaneously under the supervision of a white superior or a tenured slave. The hardest working slaves, called “pace-setters”, were spread amongst the different groups as an example for those around them. Unlike tasking, ganging was amenable to supervision and quality control, and lacked an inherent measure of individual effort.&lt;ref name="digitalhistory"/&gt;

Some contemporary scholars argue that the Chesapeake was a more hospitable environment for slaves. It was more common in the Chesapeake for a slave to work alongside his master, an arrangement unheard of in the strict vertical hierarchies of massive Southern plantations. Whites and blacks were more deeply divided in the Deep South, and tasking allowed slave owners to arbitrarily replace individuals who did not meet expectations. Others argue that it is disingenuous to romanticize one incarnation of slavery over another and that neither environment was “hospitable” despite these differences.&lt;ref name="digitalhistory"/&gt;

==Colonial tobacco culture==
[[File:Rolls's_Best_Virginia_tobacco_advertisement.jpg|thumb|18th-century tobacco advertisement]]

=== Background ===
A culture of expertise surrounded tobacco planting. Unlike cotton or rice, cultivating tobacco was seen as an art form, and buyers understood that behind every crop of good tobacco was a meticulous planter with exceptional skills. Tobacco shipments were “branded” with a signature unique to its planter before they were sent overseas, and guarantors regarded brands as a seal of approval from the planter himself. One planter proclaimed of his branded tobacco, “it was made on the plantation where I live and therefore as I saw to the whole management of it my self ''(sic)'', I can with authority recommend it to be exceedingly good.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4248923 Rutman, Anita H. "Still Planting the Seeds of Hope: The Recent Literature of the Early Chesapeake Region." The Virginia Magazine Jan. 1987: 3-24. JSTOR. Web. 28 April 2010] Retrieved August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Even though not necessarily participating in the manual labor, planters took great financial stake in their final product.

Furthermore, local reputation and social status varied with the quality of one’s leaf. In his book ''Tobacco Culture'', author T.H. Breen writes “quite literally, the quality of a man’s tobacco often served as the measure of the man.”&lt;ref name="Breen"&gt;Breen&lt;/ref&gt; Proficient planters, held in high regard by their peers, often exercised significant political clout in colonial governments. Farmers often spent excess profits on expensive luxury goods from London to indicate to others that their tobacco was selling well. Notably, [[Thomas Jefferson]]’s [[Monticello]] estate was styled after the dwellings of wealthy European aristocrat.

===American Revolution===
American tobacco planters, including Jefferson and [[George Washington]], financed their plantations with sizeable loans from London. When tobacco prices dropped precipitously in the 1750s, many plantations struggled to remain financially solvent. Severe debt threatened to unravel colonial power structures and destroy planters’ personal reputations. At his [[Mount Vernon]] plantation, Washington saw his liabilities swell to nearly £2000 by the late 1760s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Randall, Willard Sterne]]. George Washington a Life. New York: Henry Holt &amp;, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson, on the verge of losing his own farm, aggressively espoused various conspiracy theories. Though never verified, Jefferson accused London merchants of unfairly depressing tobacco prices and forcing Virginia farmers to take on unsustainable debt loads. In 1786, he remarked:
::''“A powerful engine for this [mercantile profiting] was the giving of good prices and credit to the planter till they got him more immersed in debt than he could pay without selling lands or slaves. They then reduced the prices given for his tobacco so that…they never permitted him to clear off his debt.”''&lt;ref name="Breen"/&gt;

The inability to pay what one owed was not just a financial failing, but a moral one. Planters whose operations collapsed were condemned as “sorry farmers” – unable to produce good crops and inept at managing their land, slaves, and assets. Washington excused his situation thusly:
::''“Mischance rather than Misconduct hath been the cause of [my debt]…It is but an irksome thing to a free mind to be always hampered in Debt.”''&lt;ref&gt;Haworth, Paul Leland. George Washington: Farmer Being an Account of His Home Life and Agricultural Activities,. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill Company, 1915. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with a global financial crisis and growing animosity toward British rule, tobacco interests helped unite disparate colonial players and produced some of the most vocal revolutionaries behind the call for American independence. A spirit of rebellion arose from their claims that insurmountable debts prevented the exercise of basic human freedoms.

'''Traditional Chinese veterinary medicine''' ('''TCVM''') is the ancient [[veterinary]] treatment of animals based on the same theories as [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM). TCM and TCVM have developed over a period of over 3,500 years and are practiced all over the world. In Western cultures such as the U.S., TCVM has rapidly grown as an adjunct therapeutic modality for animals that do not respond favorably to typical Western veterinary treatments.

Chinese philosophical truths based on [[Taoism]] are the underpinnings that influence the practice of TCVM. The fundamental truth for health in TCVM is balance—balance within yourself, balance with others, balance with your diet, and balance with nature.

TCVM practices include four major fundamental branches: [[Chinese food therapy]], [[acupuncture]], [[herbalism|herbal therapy]],and [[Tui na]] ("twee-na")

Its counterpart TCM includes other such treatments as [[herbalism|herbal medicine]] (中药), [[acupuncture]], [[dieting|dietary therapy]], and both [[tui na|tui-na]] and [[shiatsu|shiatsu massage]]. [[Qigong]] and [[Taijiquan]] are also closely associated with TCM.

TCVM has evolved simultaneously with the evolution of TCM. TCVM originated thousands of years ago through meticulous observation of nature, the cosmos, and the human body. Major contributing theories that apply to the practice of both TCM and TCVM include: the Yin-yang theory, the five-element theory, the human body Channel system, Zang-Fu organ physiology, six confirmations, four layers, etc.

==Food therapy==
Food therapy is the art and science of combining foods based on their inherent energetic properties. Unlike Western medicine, food is an integral component of treating and preventing disease in TCVM. The Eastern world is focused on the effect food has on the body after it is eaten. Each food item is described as having energetic properties such as warming, cooling, or flavors that act on the body in certain predictable yet different ways. Various food combinations may be used to maintain and support the balance of [[yin and yang]] thereby maintaining optimal health. When disease occurs, certain food combinations may be employed to return the body to a balanced state. Food therapy is one of the five fundamental branches of TCVM and a powerful component of the TCVM treatment regime.

==Acupuncture==
Acupuncture is an ancient form of medicine using small filiform needles placed at predetermined points on the body. The goal of acupuncture is to move Qi—the force that makes us alive. Western medicine has no equivocal term to describe Qi. Qi flows throughout the body along [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]], or paths that interconnect the external surface of the body with the internal organs. When needles are placed in points, Qi moves freely. As Qi moves freely, the body maintains its balance, or homeostasis.

==Herbal therapy==
Herbal therapy is the use of therapeutic medicines derived from plants, animals, and substances occurring in the natural environment. Herbs are used to move Qi as well as tonify Yin and Yang. [[Yin and yang]] are equal yet opposing forces that occur in all naturally occurring phenomena. For instance, Yin corresponds to nighttime, cold, or resting of the body. Yang, on the other hand, corresponds to daytime, heat, and activity of the body. Whenever Yin or Yang becomes deficient or excessive, the balance of the body is lost, and disease results. Herbs are used to restore this natural balance. The Western equivalent to Chinese herbs is pharmaceutical drugs, such as [[antibiotics]] and anti-inflammatory medicines. Both western drugs and Chinese herbs are prescribed based on a medical diagnosis. Lately, Western herbals have become popular in the United States. However, distinct differences exist between Western and Chinese herbs. Western herbs are used in a singular form to treat symptoms of disease without a medical diagnosis. Chinese herbs are often a formula or mixture of herbs prescribed according to a medical diagnosis. Generally, in treating a patient, acupuncture is used in conjunction with herbal medicine.

==Tui-Na==
Tui-Na is medical manipulation with the hands much like the modern versions of Western [[chiropractic]] and massage therapy. Various techniques are employed to massage the meridians and enhance the flow of Qi throughout the body. Certified Tui-Na practitioners often teach pet owners several techniques to use at home to enhance the treatment of disease.

==Qi-Gong==
Qi-Gong is the combination of exercise and meditation in which the flow of Qi is improved. It also is a way to balance the [[yin and yang]] of the body. This branch of Traditional Chinese Medicine does not apply to animals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14140">'''Water privatization in Albania''' was initiated by the Albanian government in the early 2000s with the support of the World Bank and German development cooperation. The stated objective was to improve the quality and efficiency of urban water supply and sanitation. At the time, many households received water only for a few hours every day, utilities were overstaffed, water tariffs were low and many customers did not pay their water bills. There was no single municipal wastewater treatment plant in the country of 3 million, which is among Europe's poorest countries. In 2002-03 three contracts were signed with foreign private operators covering six secondary cities. [[Water privatization]] never covered more than a fifth of the country’s population. The contracts expired or were terminated early five years later with few tangible improvements in service quality.

==Situation before privatization==
Much of the water and sewerage infrastructure in Albania was built between the 1950s and early 70s with help from the [[People’s Republic of China]]. When Chinese aid ended in 1978 after the two communist governments fell out with each other, the infrastructure deteriorated with little or no maintenance. The responsibility for water supply rested with the central government with no participation by local governments and communities. With the fall of communism in the 1992 elections, the provision of water supply and sanitation services was assigned to 52 state-owned regional water enterprises in an effort to empower local government. Typically, the service area of a regional water enterprise comprises several municipalities. The  mayors of Albania's 373 municipalities (Albanian: ''bashki'' or ''komunë'') nominate the members of the management councils of the regional water company which serves their territory.

However, all important decisions about investments and staffing actually continued to be taken by the central government, so that local governments felt that they had no actual responsibility for water supply. Revenues were insufficient to cover even operating expenses, and electricity bills or even salaries went unpaid unless the central government provided subsidies. Investments picked up with Western aid after 1992, but service quality continued to remain poor.&lt;ref name="World Bank Reform"/&gt;

About 70% of all water produced was [[non-revenue water]] and only 30% was billed. Only 70% of these bills were actually paid, so that ultimately only 21% of the water produced was actually paid for. Furthermore, the regional water and sewer companies had about three times more staff per connection than in other Eastern European and Central Asian utilities. Low revenues and high costs led to an average operating cost recovery rate of only 60%. On all these counts, the performance of Albanian water companies was much lower than the performance of utilities in other former communist countries ten years after the beginning of the transition process.&lt;ref name=PEIR&gt;World Bank:[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTALBANIA/Resources/PEIR_Presentation_water.pdf Albania Public Expenditure and Institutional Review:Restructuring Public Expenditure to Sustain Growth - Sector related presentations-Water], 15 March 2007; retrieved on 23 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning service quality, on average water was available only 3–4 hours per day. Certain areas received water only once in three days, which was partly due to intermittent power supply for pumps. There was no wastewater treatment. Sewers were often clogged causing seepage and cross-contamination with drinking water. Many covers for [[manhole]]s were missing so that they filled with rubbish.&lt;ref name="World Bank Reform"&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Study on Albania: Reforming the Irrigation and Domestic Water Supply and Sanitation Services to Benefit the Poor|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTALBANIA/Resources/ShanghaiAlbaniaWaterSupplyCaseStudy.pdf|work=Conference on Scaling Up Poverty Reduction|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=22 October 2011|author=Andreas Rohde |author2=Toru Konishi |author3=Subramaniam Janakira|location=Beijing|date=May 25–27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforms==
[[File:Albania map.png|thumb|left|Map of Albania showing three provincial cities - Elbasan, Durrës and Sarandë - out of six whose water supply has been privatized in 2002-03.]]   
The reform strategy for the urban water and sanitation sector included three main elements: decentralization, [[water privatization|private sector participation]] and increased cost recovery.&lt;ref name="World Bank Reform"/&gt; The reforms were decided and implemented by governments under [[Socialist Party of Albania|socialist]] Prime Ministers that ruled from 1997 to 2005. The reform process was supported by German development cooperation and the [[World Bank]] with financing and technical assistance. The government also decided that 6 companies would enter into public-private partnerships with foreign companies through 3 contracts. [[Water privatization]] thus never covered more than a fifth of the country’s population. The water supply for the capital [[Tirana]] was not privatized.

In 1998 the government instructed 18 of the 52 regional water enterprises to transform themselves into joint stock companies whose shares were held by the central government. However, in 2000 the government passed the "Law on Organization and Functioning of Local Governments, No. 8652" which gave the exclusive responsibility for water supply and sanitation to the municipalities. Thus the government sent what appears to be contradictory signals: keeping the shares of joint stock companies in the hands of central government, while passing the responsibility for the sector to the municipalities.

It is thus perhaps not surprising that the transformation of regional water companies to joint stock companies was slow: as of 2003 only 10 had completed the transformation and the by-laws necessary for the implementation of the local government law were not yet issued. The continued strong role of central government is shown by the fact that in the privatization process the central government, and not local governments, selected the private companies and signed the contracts with them.

===Elbasan concession===
[[File:Elbasan 1.jpg|thumb|In the central Albanian city of Elbasan the first private sector water supply contract in Albania was signed.]]
The first private sector contract, a 30-year concession for [[Elbasan]], took effect in April 2002. It was awarded to [[Berlinwasser]] International. It was supported by German development cooperation, which was to finance 70% of investment while the remainder was to be financed by the private concessionnaire.&lt;ref name=PPP/&gt; The contract had been negotiated between Berlinwasser and the Albanian government since 1999, when it had been expected the contract would be signed in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berlinwasser|title=Berliner Wasser und KfW: Public-Private-Partnership für Albanien. Wieczorek-Zeul: Modellfall wirtschaftlichen Know-how-Transfers.|url=http://www.berlinwasser.de/content/language1/html/257_260_3741423330434539373945393438393742364431343932383138433746324431.php|accessdate=23 October 2011|date=2 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kavajë management contract===
The second contract, a 4-year management contract for the [[Kavajë]] district, took effect in early 2003. The contract was meant to “prepare the ground for more substantial private sector participation at a later stage.”&lt;ref name=PPP&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/41/41/36820408.pdf German Development Co-operation with Albania :Abstract of the Evaluation “Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in German Development Cooperation”  - Country Study Albania]&lt;/ref&gt; It was awarded to Aquamundo and was also financed by German development cooperation. Aquamundo was initially a joint venture owned by [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Bilfinger Berger]] and [[:de:MVV Energie|MVV Energie]], the utility that serves the German city of [[Mannheim]].&lt;ref&gt;Global Water Intelligence: [http://www.globalwaterintel.com/archive/4/2/general/aquamundo-wins-albanian-management-contract.html Aquamundo wins Albanian management contract], February 2003&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to other sources Aquamundo was two third-owned by the Saudi Arabian [[Amiantit]] Company, through its subsidiary AmiWater, when it signed the contract.&lt;ref&gt;Amiantit:[http://www.amiantit.com/en/news/News_Archive/2003-06_01.php Saudi Arabian Amiantit Subsidiary Aquamundo Takes Over Drinking Water Supply And Sewage Disposal Operations In Four Albanian Cities], June 6, 2003; retrieved on 23 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to the company website, Aquamundo has only been part of Amiantit Company since 2004.

The objectives were to introduce continuous water supply, reduce water losses and increase bill collection. Furthermore, the contract included the construction and operation of the first wastewater treatment plant in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;Aquamundo:[http://www.aquamundo.de/Projects%20-%20Kavaja.htm Provision of Water and Sewerage Services to U.K. Kavajë sh.a., Republic of Albania]; retrieved on 23 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Four cities management contract===
[[File:Durrës Albania 2.jpg|thumb|left|In the port city of Durrës where the water supply system was run by a private company from 2003 to 2008, continuity of water supply stagnated at 2-3 hours per day, short of the modest target of 6 hours per day.]]
The third contract, a 5-year management contract for the districts of [[Durrës]], [[Fier]], [[Lezhë]] and [[Sarandë]], took effect in June 2003. It was financed by the [[World Bank]]. The objectives of this contract were to increase the continuity of water supply, to improve water quality, to increase bill collection and cost recovery. It was signed with Berlinwasser International, but Aquamundo was involved as a subcontractor.

==Impact==
There is little public information available about the impact of the privatization in Elbasan and Kavajë. However, the World Bank has published detailed information on the impact of the four cities concession in the completion report for the project that financed the management contract.

[[File:View of Lezhë.jpg|thumb|In the city of Lezhë the compliance with drinking water quality standards increased from 55% to almost 100% during the management contract. However, cost recovery remained poor.]]

'''Service quality'''. The continuity of supply in Fier and Sarandë increased significantly, but it remained unchanged at a low level of 2–3 hours per day in Durrës and equally unchanged at a high level of 20 hours per day in Lezhë. Water quality compliance improved markedly in Lehzë and Sarandë; it had already been good in the other two cities.

'''Cost recovery'''. Financial indicators for the four utilities had been below the Albanian average at the beginning of the management contract, although the Albanian average was already below the average of other formerly communist countries. From this dismal starting point the collection efficiency and cost recovery improved somewhat, but remained far from satisfactory: Collection efficiency was 56-81% and operating cost recovery 40-60% at the beginning of the contract. The objective of 79% collection efficiency was reached in only one city, while the objective of operation cost recovery was not reached in any city despite tariff increases.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2010/07/20/000333037_20100720031625/Rendered/PDF/ICR9310P0414421C0disclosed071161101.pdf Municipal Water And Wastewater Project] Implementation Completion Report, 10 July 2010, p. 10; retrieved on 23 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Residential water tariffs almost doubled in two cities and almost tripled in the other two between 2002 and 2008. They were 15-20 Lek per cubic meter in 2002 (11-15 Euro Cent) and stood at 35-43 Lek (29-36 Euro Cent) in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2010/07/20/000333037_20100720031625/Rendered/PDF/ICR9310P0414421C0disclosed071161101.pdf Municipal Water And Wastewater Project] Implementation Completion Report, 10 July 2010, p. 22; retrieved on 23 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In order to protect the poor from tariff increases, the Government supported the four municipalities to test a free basic water policy. Low-income metered households were to be provided 20 liters per capita per day free of charge beginning in 2004.&lt;ref name="World Bank Reform"/&gt; However, the policy was difficult to implement, because metering is a precondition for free basic water and only about 20% of residential customers were metered. Without free basic water, a tariff of 40 Lek per cubic meter corresponded to about 3% of the income of a poor household in 2006.&lt;ref name=PEIR/&gt;

Supervisory Boards of the utilities retained ultimate authority for key decisions such as staffing.
